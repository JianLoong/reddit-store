We live in a small 2 bed flat with almost no storage space. I have been through his toys and cleaned out the \"baby\" items that he has outgrown, but he still has a lot that he has got for his last birthday and last 2 Christmases that are developmentally appropriate. We are very fortunate to have friends and family happy to give us their old clothes and items when their children outgrow them, and so despite me being on a very low income he doesn't go without.\n\nLast Christmas I noticed that he was starting to just tip out all his toys and then trip over, get upset, or just want to sit down. I looked things up and realised he was probably overwhelmed and not able to play because there was just too much stuff to the point it just became mess and clutter. So I tried to say no thankyou to presents and redirect relatives to buy size up clothing, books or experiences for him but almost everyone still bought toys and items which just added to the stuff. I got very frustrated with Easter just passed, when multiple people have him gifts (Easter isn't a gift giving holiday!!!) Knowing that I was already struggling with the stuff from Christmas. And so, I have requested no gifts for his upcoming birthday. Despite it being awkward I have told people that he has a savings account which will go towards his one day tertiary study, car or house.\n\nLast night I was at his grandma's house (father's mother) and she mentioned \"I know you said no gifts but I got him something, hope you don't mind\" with a grin. In the politest way possible I said thankyou but I'm really running out of space. Then his aunt said a similar thing. Then his step mum again \"you said no gifts but...\" And I was like seriously? You all know we live in a tiny place and it's really overwhelming. \n\nShe said I was being ungrateful, I am cruel to expect a 2 year old to get nothing for his birthday, taking that experience and excitement from him, and I should just clear out his old toys when he's not looking. I honestly think they're being assholes by disrespecting my boundary, and expecting me to deal with his tantrums from having too much stuff, work out how to clean or store it all, and make him give away his things to make room!

Say it nicely but firmly. \n\n2) Tell them that all the toys they give will need to stay at their house. It'll be great because every time you take him over there, he'll have new toys to play with!\n\n3) If you have a partner, they need to back you up on this. You must present a united front.", "NTA.\n\nLook as a relative its soo nice to see a little one get a new toy from you and be so very, happy, excited and appreciative. But that's not the reality of your situation. I'm sure they dont want to be the one responsible for forcing a little one to pick between a bunch if toys that he loves.\n\nAs your family doesn't seem to want to gift practical items because your son won't be excited in the same way, maybe you could try experiences instead? Son doesn't want any new toys because he has enough, but he really wants to go to the zoo/disneyland/holiday/magic show. Could you help us to fund that?", "NTA, not at all.  I had a similar issue and also tried to have no-gift-birthdays.  You are NOT being cruel or mean, do not let them bs you - you are being practical.  I think older relatives have the hardest time with the idea of no gifts.  It worked better with our younger relatives - they were happy to give books and experiences (art classes, a train ride, zoo pass, etc.) One option for you - think of donating some of the gifts.  Childrens ward at the hospital, or a local day care would love your extra things.", "nta. cruel to a 2 yr to get nothing for a bday? A 2 year old doesn't care, they're like cats, they'll play more with the box that the toy came in than  the actual toy. I'd say either stand up to them and tell them you won't be accepting any gifts or take them and donate them to a children's charity.", "My daughter just turned 2 twelve days ago and she got exactly 0 gifts from me... granted we're in a situation of not having a place to live right now, but still. Even if we did, for me it was buying her an experience. We got pizza and went to an arcade, and had cake and she had a BLAST. Very often she gets overwhelmed or doesn't care about her toys. So others can send them and I focus on the experiences and core memories. She does not hate me for this. \n\nNTA, don't let others make it seem like you're being selfish. I do think the donation to the account is a bit much; but you still gave other options too. If anything you could make a wishlist on somewhere like Amazon or elsewhere of things he does need or whatnot, that helps usually. Or give ideas on things to do (tickets to the zoo, to the aquarium, to a learning museum, etc). If they're still disrespecting it, then honey they are most definitely the AH.", "Its weird how \"No toys\" turns into \"No gifts at all\" when you provided alternate suggestions of gifts such as books and contributions for your sons college fund. \n\nBut INFO also what happens if a bunch of folks end up sending books? Would you have space for those?", "Tell them you\u2019re leaving the gifts at their houses, easy peasy", "NTA.\n\nAlso books at this age ARE toys", "Info: have you explained to the relatives WHY you've initiated the no-gifts rule? Have they been made aware the sheer amount is overwhelming to your son and is not just a \"I don't want to have to deal with organization?\"  Either way, they're still kinda being disrespectful since you asked for no gifts, but it sounds like from their perspective, it may look like a two year old is being deprived of toys because mom is tired of cleaning. Definitely not saying that's the case, but how much have they been told?", "NTA I\u2019m sorry nobody in the family is listening to you. Have you explained that he gets overstimulated when presented with too many options? \n\nI have a similar situation and my little one never grew out if it. She\u2019s 6 now and still gets overstimulated by clutter and too many options. I am lucky that I do have ONE relative that just gives cash to put into her college fund. And an aunt that always gives books, which she LOVES. She\u2019s excited to get presents, sure, but then they never even get touched. She got a cool present for Christmas and has played with it one time and that was only because a playmate came over and wanted to play with it with her.", "NTA. \n\nYou'll get pushback.\n\nI argued with my mom about this for a few years when my kids were small. She'd complain about their room being messy and I'd say \"It's mostly stuff *you* gave them.\" \n\nOne day she took it upon herself to clean it. (No we did not live together.)\n\nShe pulled SIX\n\nI shit you not\n\nSix Hefty bags- think full size garbage bags like for the outdoor garbage can- of clothes and willingly relinquished toys out of their room.\n\nThe gift giving slowed down after that.  \n\n\ud83d\ude01\n\nNip it in the bud for sure, especially if your family has money.\n\nIt's also okay to have birthday parties and let people know not to bring a gift *even when they're older*. \n\nIt cuts back on expenses for everyone involved and nobody hates what they got or has to figure out what to buy.\n\nNormalize *thoughtful* gift giving not obligatory *at least we got something*.", "NTA.  Toys are a lazy gift, there are plenty of other options that don't cause clutter.  If family members don't/won't listen, leave the toys at their place so that your son has a toy there when you visit.", "Yeah NTA. You told them no toys and you told them why, I agree with some of the comments I\u2019ve seen a bout donating them and I like the idea you mentioned in your post about financial gifts going to his college fund/savings. That said, it doesn\u2019t sound like they\u2019re being malicious by getting him toys it\u2019s just not getting through to them that it\u2019s just clutter that they\u2019re gifting, which must be really frustrating. Maybe you could try more firmly outlining why they really shouldn\u2019t give him toys? Or just donate them until they get the hint\u2026.", "Get a box and box up the toys in three sets leave any fabmvorots out for him but only put out one of the boxes of maybe 8 toys then in a few months change them round for the next box and so forth Intill he has outgrown then then do the same for the next ones. It will stop him getting overwhelmed with to many toys and the excitement of new toys every couple of months is worth it even though they are just his other toys it feel like something new to him. Nta presents at that age are over rated maybe asked for toy gift cards so you can get some toys as he grows and put them into circulation.", "NTA\\INFO. no toys <> no gifts. which one is it. Excess toys can be left and gradmas house for all the times you'll be coming over to play.", "Don\u2019t ask people to contribute to his college fund. Put the toys on eBay and then use the money to go to the college fund.  And don\u2019t have any more kids until your finances dramatically improve.", "NTA. As a person who firmly believes in less toys or only developmental toys and a little bit of here and there, I believe you have the right to actually tell them no. Maybe for next time just make a card for holidays. All possible holiday's and say no gifts . And to your near and dear ones ask them to contribute to college fund. \n\nI mean this is so amazing. Your idea. Instead of filling dumps with garbage that your child will outgrow in a few months, the money even if 10 15 dollars will go a long way. It might mean a hot meal on a difficult day. \n\nI have a young niece and the amount of plastic I see with in her toy closet makes my blood boil. But she ain't my child and her mother is fulfilling some childhood fantasy as she didn't have much toys. How difficult it is for grown ass people to understand that this is not the future for your child.\n\nEvery plastic toy you buy , the child might outgrow it soon esp in young ages and it's going to a fill. Sorry for being a sour puss. But a 2 yr old doesn't know much and hence we should be the ones (the parents) to actually take care of it and teach them not to be potential hoarders lol.", "No space I understand. But not all gifts take up space. Going to a water park or carnival or something like that costs money, is fun and takes up no space afterwards.", "mild YTA because you have discovered you can't stop the madness. You can be the mom though - and for every new toy that is given, one goes away to charity. Even if they are age appropriate and still in good condition.\n\nOther than that, you could try to come up with some vertical storage solutions.", "YTA you don't want to deal with his tantrums. He's 2 years old. Terrible twos ever heard of it. You are taking away his experience. What kind of mother wants her kid to sit there on his birthday and not get presents. Cycle out his older toys its what every parent does. Easter is a gift giving holiday its usually small gifts in a basket along with chocolate. You should be so grateful your child has loving and gift giving people in his life. Some kids don't have that.", "Mild ESH.  Your relatives are definitely being shitty to you and violating the very clear boundary you set.  Right now it's cluttered toys, but they are also demonstrating that if they think something is part of a \"normal childhood\", they're just going to do it whether you want them to or not.\n\nHowever, they are also right.  Getting so frustrated over clutter that you declare no gifts for your kids birthday is a non sustainable solution, and yes it will definitely impact your kid.\n\nTo everyone saying \"he's only two he won't remember this\".  You're right, he won't remember it, which is why it will be confusing and frightening to him that birthdays and clutter give him anxiety as an adult.  The shit that happens to us as infants and toddlers MATTERS.  Things like what the OP described aren't isolated incidents that don't connect to anything else in life.  If OP is that frustrated with the situation, it is guaranteed to change their behavior in countless ways they won't even notice, but their kid definitely will.\n\nYou haven't done anything egregious or awful, but you're going to need to figure out a better solution before he turns 3, and to have a serious and explicit talk with your relatives about boundaries and your kid.  I'd also encourage you to think about your own relationship with the idea of \"clutter\".", "YTA, nobody HAS to get your son anything. You can make suggestions of what would be more helpful, but at the end of the day, it's their money and you're sounding very entitled.\n\nAlso, speaking as someone who once was a kid, it's really disappointing to get a cash donation or an educational book for your birthday. I get that the clutter is stressing you out, but seriously just take an hour before the holiday and throw a bunch of crap in a donation bag.\n\nHow is a book less clutter?", "ESH - Why don\u2019t you just donate all his toys away? That way your house doesn\u2019t get cluttered up and your son doesn\u2019t get overwhelmed with new amounts of toys. Or at very least have a yard sale or something similar and sell them. \n\nAsking people to contribute financially to your son\u2019s account seems a bit awkward. I understand the clothes part though.", "YTA Also, IDK what country you're in but yeah, Easter is a gift holiday where I live (although at that age it's mostly candy). Look, you can always donate the gifts if your son doesn't like them or play with them. Just take it and say thank you.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

If you don't have the space for the toy, keeping it at grandma's for the child to play with is a perfect compromise. It's why I plan to have a kid's basketball hoop at my house for my nephew to play with when he comes over, since my yard is much more spacious than the one at nephew's home. \n\nIf grandma really wanted to get something for the kid, clothing is a thing. As would a gift card to the book store or toy store for when you want to buy new books or toys, and if grandma really wanted to, she could make it a grandma/grandkid date, where she takes the kid to the store and they pick out something to keep at your place, and you would have cleared out space for it.", "NTA.
