I mean if she introduced you to her parents as a student, how would that look like if then they found out that you two are dating?", "I\u2019m glad you got the help you needed, but I really need to ask if you\u2019re okay now, because the post about the relationship really is giving off some massive red flags. Are you sure you\u2019re okay now?", "That's even more predatory", "And you think you owe her sex for her help?", "So...you owe her sex and companionship that no one, especially her family, is allowed to know about?", "Oh man, please please read everyone\u2019s comments. Your gf preyed on you, you were in a tough situation and she took advantage of that and your age.", "Saying nothing is tacit agreement. He doesn't know the situation between GF and parents", "She was anxious people would realize she groomed you.", "And did you ask her WHY she didn't want you to reveal the truth about your relationship to others?", "She wasn't my teacher. I volunteered at my old high school when I was 19 as part of one of her tutoring programs, and I would sometimes interact with her. After a few times talking with her, it came up that I was homeless and I really just vented my pent up feelings of depression from my abusive family to her. She told me she had a counseling certification and offered me a few sessions, and then offered to let me move in with her because I was really struggling. I don't know how I would have survived without her.", "Providing him housing could potentially be part of grooming, but the rest of your examples..... that's not what grooming is.\n\nIt does seem she's done some unethical things here, and this is clearly not the kind of relationship OP thinks it is (healthy, loving, committed partnership).\n\nBut let's not jump to extreme conclusions.", "Were you ever her student? How did you guys meet?", "Lmao no im just high.", "Oops", ">He's legal age\n\nIt's not like people magically become incapable of being groomed as soon as they reach their 18th birthday. Obviously nothing illegal is going on, but in practicality, a 20 year old is still much too young for someone who's almost 40", "Oh my bad, I see what you mean. Yeah I don't know why she thought it would be a good idea to present me as her student, it's not sustainable and would cause more issues.", "Yes, and it's thanks to her, because she let me move in with her. That way I could continue college without living on the streets. She can be a little bit overbearing at times, but that's just her protective nature.", "I don't \"owe\" her anything. Once I moved in we started liking each other and decided to be a couple.", "That literally makes it worse. She's groomed you. Actual certified counselors don't have romantic relationships with the people they counsel. Nor do they move them into their home after barely any time. You're barely out of your teens and not thinking clearly.", "Helping you was great BUT dating you later on given this context is not okay and makes the formerly given help feel more predatory than genuine. Wow. You don\u2019t set yourself up as someone\u2019s counselor and savior and then go after them in any romantic (or just physical) sense.", "I'm glad you're in a better place but that's a massive ethics violation on her part.  She's a walking example of what not to do as a counselor.", "This makes it even worse though. If she\u2019s a licensed counselor she should be abiding by ethics codes and not having romantic relationships with clients or asking them to move in with her. She could lose her counseling license for that or at least be punished in some way by licensing boards. I\u2019m sorry to say but your girlfriend is a massive red banner, not even a red flag. I mean, listen to the way you are speaking of her. \u201cAsk her permission\u201d it sounds like she\u2019s your mother.\n\nA 38 year old teacher that frequently invites students your age to her parents house is just plain inappropriate. She likely knows she\u2019s creepy which is why she\u2019s trying so hard to hide you. You\u2019ve been seeing her a whole year and haven\u2019t been invited, yet she frequently invites students she\u2019s probably only known for a couple months if that? Or maybe she even has multiple boyfriends your age and she\u2019s trying to keep that quiet. This whole situation is just so concerning. I\u2019m barely 6 years older than you and would never think of dating someone your age, because I was that age, too not too long ago and the amount of growth and change to be done is still a lot. And by the way, in an adult, serious relationship a year is not \u201ctoo short\u201d of a time to meet parents, in fact, in most adult relationships after a year usually it\u2019s guaranteed the couple has met each other parents if the parents are in the person\u2019s life.\n\nI\u2019m curious, are any of her exes also past students?", "She groomed you.", "Ok. Look. I understand your perspective and your feelings. However you should try and understand what these commenters are saying. She did groom you (whether intentionally or not) and it is an unhealthy relationship. \n\nThe quickest way to diagnose an unhealthy relationship IMO is to look at the power dynamics. Let\u2019s have a look. \n\n1. You met while she was your superior. (You were a volunteer she was a tutor.) \ud83d\udea9\n2. You met while you were in your teens and she was in her late thirties. \ud83d\udea9\n3. You were homeless, she was not. (She has the upper hand, not really a red flag to be fair)\n4. You were in an abusive environment. (As point above)\n\nIf she responded to all these points by simply helping you and finding you a place to live - great, that\u2019s really nice of her. \n\nBUT doing that, AND THEN allowing a relationship to develop while knowing the quite significant power dynamic issues, that\u2019s what makes it inappropriate and unhealthy. \n\nthis situation is one where she clearly has more control - she has more life experience, she has control over you having a roof over your head, she has control over your mind in so much as she\u2019s counseling you, she likely has control of finances etc", "Woooah. This woman has severely crossed *several* ethical boundaries with you:\n\n1. You don\u2019t just trot out your counseling cert when you feel like it \n2. If she\u2019s a school counselor, she\u2019s not qualified to provide you with therapy. School counseling and therapy are two very different things. \n3. Acting as your counselor when she knew you in a different capacity creates a conflict of interest \n4. Dating you after being your counselor creates a whole other conflict of interest\n5. Having a client live in your house is yet another severe conflict of interest \n\nThis person does not maintain healthy boundaries and is doing some highly unethical and likely illegal things when she breaches these boundaries. And I know you may have a hard time understanding this but a 38 year old who works with kids os very very aware of just how young 20 is. The fact that she wants to date a 20 year old and hide it from her parents shows that she absolutely knows this. \n\nOP, you\u2019re dating a predator.", "In many states (like mine) it\u2019s illegal for public school teachers to date students even after they graduate and even if they weren\u2019t technically teaching you a class. From you description she was a teacher with a school tutoring program for at-risk kids that you volunteered at. Which definitely put her in a position pf power over you. At the very least, she\u2019s violated the school or program\u2019s code of ethics, which is a fireable offense.", "Dude. That's grooming. Holy.", "It's great that she helped you in these ways.  I hope things are starting to look up for you and that you're getting on your feet.\nBut definitely reevaluate the nature of your relationship with this person.\nAlso, if you don't have a counselor (who is not romantically involved with you), consider getting one.  It sounds like it would help.", "Okay so\u2026.you were much younger, had no family to help you (or tell you what a creep she is) and in swoops a nearly middle aged woman to offer you, someone who was just recently a child, a place to live \n\nEven she knows shes creepy that\u2019s why she wants people to think youre her student and not her bf", "I was never her student. I explained the circumstances of our meeting in another comment, you can check my comment history if you want.", "Too young, yes I agree, but it isn't grooming. Using that term comes with very specific connotations to it that do not apply to a legal age adult person.", "Ok OP, what if a woman posted on here saying that when she was 19 and homeless, a grown man twice her age let her move in with him and then they started dating 2 months later? You'd probably say that it was predatory behavior. \n\nA grown woman does NOT get involved with a teen, there is nothing in common but superficial stuff. You were struggling and at a low point in your life and needed help...and she took advantage of you. You probably are having trouble recognizing it because from your perspective, she helped you. \n\nOP, I'm a teacher. I would be fired if I did this, and rightfully so. I would also probably be blacklisted from the field. That's how unacceptable and disgusting this is. This is something you will look back on and regret. Please look into other resources and move away from this woman.", "She thought it\u2019d be a good idea so she could use that as a cover to her parents, instead of letting them know she was dating someone half her age and who\u2019s barely an adult. She knows it\u2019s wrong, which is why she wanted to lie about it", "It\u2019s her protective nature because she\u2019s old enough to be your mother.  A young mother but still.  If she\u2019s embarrassed of the relationship then it shouldn\u2019t be one.  You said it\u2019s been a year so you were 19 when you met her and probably her student which could look bad for her, but beside from that dating someone a year doesn\u2019t equal \u201cfresh status\u201d.   NTA", "I\u2019m glad you are feeling safe where you are. Truly.\n\nI can\u2019t agree that she\u2019s only overbearing because she\u2019s protective, unless you can explain how telling you to lie about your relationship with zero room to discuss that order fits into that, but I\u2019ll admit I don\u2019t know her and can only go off what you\u2019ve written as context.", "Yea I don\u2019t believe this is real.", "Please wake up. Why is a 38 year old with a 20 year old? How is this an equal partnership? Intellectually you two are miles apart, and this is abnormal behaviour. You may think she loves you, and maybe she does, but please think long and hard why she\u2019s unable to attract someone similar to her age.", "And yet she won't be honest about who you are. That's another red flag on top of everything else she's exhibited.", "But she wants to hide you in a little box. That\u2019s not a healthy relationship, OP.", "Oh boy.", "She could lose her license for all of this.", "Your comment history makes it worse!!! Her being your counselor is a HUGE abuse of power...", "Unfortunately the circumstances of your meeting make it worse. Regardless of how you met she is hiding your relationship for a reason. Can you think of any reason other than the relationship being inappropriate? I hope one day you can logically think about what you would have done if the roles were reversed and I hope you wouldn\u2019t date the young impressionable girl who you were helping out of a hard time. Do you think if she told her colleagues about your relationship they would think it\u2019s ok? I totally get that you love her and men tend to not see these situations as problems but they are. Love isn\u2019t enough.", "A young mother? She\u2019s 38. She would\u2019ve been 18 when this guy was born. That\u2019s not even young enough to be featured on Teen Mom. Just saying.", "She should lose her license for all of this.", "She *should* lose her license for all of this. And have some prison time", "I meant like she would\u2019ve been 18 when she had him.  To me that\u2019s young.  Maybe MTV wouldn\u2019t call her up but it\u2019s still young imo"]}
