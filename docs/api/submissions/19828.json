But did you read that he pays for both their tickets when he takes her to the movies? He is not asking aomething that he himself doesn't do. \n\nHe is not saying 'no' to going. He is saying 'no' to paying. There is a difference. I wouldn't want to spend money on something I don't want to do.

Besides, maybe the boyfriend doesn\u2019t know her preference for this movie.
