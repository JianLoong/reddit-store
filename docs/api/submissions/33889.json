I have a son (5) and have full custody.\r\n\nMy bf has 7 kids. He has custody of his youngest 2 (10M/8M) every two weeks. His eldest son is in his late 20s and visits every few weeks with his own kids. His second oldest son is 20 and lives full time with us, he works full-time and pays rent.\r\n\nIt's the middle three's (17M, 16F, 14M) visitation that causes issues.\r\n\nThey have rooms at our house, some visits/custody time is scheduled but most the time they'll randomly show up when they want. Sometimes this is fine, but it also causes issues.\r\n\nA mundane issue is food. I never know how much to buy for the week because I could be feeding 3/5 or 6/8. Many times, I've had no snacks to give the younger boys because the teens had stopped by unannounced or been in the middle of cooking dinner when one of them shows up. Other times they plan to visit and bail last minute and I'll ending up having to waste food.\r\n\nThe unannounced visits also cause disruption to the younger boy\u2019s routine. Sometimes it's just stupid stuff like the boys being kept up by their older siblings or being over excited when they show up before bedtime. The issue happens the other way round and they get disappointed when the teens flake.\r\n\nI've previously brought up my dislike for the unscheduled visits to my bf but he doesn\u2019t see the issue and blows me off.\r\n\nHowever, we recently got into a big fight about it. All bf's kids were supposed to be at their moms for Christmas. The youngest 5 were scheduled to be with us from the 26th.\r\n\nMy parent, 2 sisters, BIL, and 2 nieces stayed with us from the 22nd to the morning of the 26th. This allowed for my family to have space in the house as we only had one kid. My parents are also not the biggest fan of my bf and don't like the number of kids he has so I try to schedule their visits when they aren't around.\r\n\nHowever, on the 23rd the 17 y/o storms into our home after a fight with his stepdad and says he's spending Christmas with us. I tell him he has to sleep on the couch because my parents are in his room, and he throws a hissy fit and basically sulked for the next few days. On the 24th 14 y/o called his dad and also wanted to spend Christmas with us. \r\n\nI didn't want him to because we didn't have enough food/space, and I had originally planned a seperate Christmas for bf's kids on the 26th. We argued for a while, but BF went to pick up his son anyway.\r\n\nIt caused issues like I knew it would. We ran out of food and there was lots of tension between my mom and 17 y/o. He kept going into his room to get stuff and wanting to play on his computer. She told him off multiple times for being rude.\r\n\nThis morning I was complaining to my bf about how they made Christmas so stressful for me and that he needed to get the kids to schedule their visits. He told me I'm being an asshole who just didn't want his kids around for Christmas. I disagreed as it's a year-round issue.\r", "created_utc": 1703728184, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18sht7l/aita_for_wanting_my_boyfriends_kids_to_schedule/", "score": 327, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Hard stop. \n\nIt sounds like you need better boundaries, not less kids. For instance, stock up on non perishables for when kids show up unexpectedly. Buy when it's on sale and keep a stash on hand. If the little need to go to bed, institute quiet time and your BF needs to help hold the line with the teenagers about that. Actually, your BF should be doing the shopping and creating safe boundaries - they are his kids. \n\nThis is about being a better parent, not excluding the teenagers from a place that is legitimately their home as well.", "YTA - your boyfriend needs a vasectomy and you need to find an age appropriate man who buys his own groceries for his kids.", "YTA", "YTA.

If he's a decent parent, which it sounds like he is, his home should always be a refuge for his minor children, for when things go wrong at their other home and they want to come back to his. I understand that their presence and absence is hard to plan around, but that's what having teenagers is like.\n\nIt sounds like you need to adopt a more flexible approach. Get some longer life snacks that you can keep on hand in case your weekly shop doesn't end up having enough. Buy an extra bag of apples, and turn any left over into stewed apples or apple cake etc, or oranges and juice the spare. Plan meals (especially around highly emotionally charged events like Christmas) with ways that they can be stretched to feed a few more at short notice, and plan to package and freeze leftovers. More importantly get your boyfriend involved in cooking and planning. Send him to the shops to get the extra things you now need given you have extra mouths to feed.\n\nIf you're having guests, have a plan for what happens if his kids need their rooms.\n\nYou're not going to succeed in getting the teenagers to only visit on schedule.

Or get a blow up bed and some camping foldaway cots and make sure a visitors know that you don't always know the visit schedule.  Or ask permission from the older kids in advance  and offer them the cots/inflatable beds.  Your family suck for imposing like that treating your boyfriend's kids poorly.\n\nHowever, YTA too for being hostile and resentful about this as well as offering rooms to your family when you know well schedules change all the time since that's what you are complaining about.  You also should have handled your mother and made sure she wasn't imposing on your boyfriend's child and should have made it clear in no uncertain terms that she may not \"tell off\" your boyfriend's child.

That\u2019s what a dad is supposed to be\u2026 WTF are you you thinking that your boyfriend\u2019s kids need an appointment?!?", "This is a logistical nightmare. Your BF needs to work with the kids to set a schedule of some kind. He also needs to be in charge of buying food and planning meals.  I know some people say kids don't need a schedule to see their parents but holidays are different due to things like your family coming in town. What if you guys have a weekend away planned. So yes some communication about schedules is needed.

This is what happens when you date someone with 7 kids.", "I can't come to a judgement as it isn't clear why you are the caterer for this family. I would step back from that role and let dad make sure his kids are fed.", "YTA. The kids obviously feel close to and safe with their dad. Before anything else, he\u2019s their dad - they are his #1 priority. So if they want to come stay with him, he should welcome them with open arms. By extension, that means you must be receptive to their presence. Stock up on dry goods for the pantry and go to the store if they show up and you don\u2019t have enough food. If they don\u2019t come as planned, use your freezer. \n\nAs for Christmas, I\u2019ll just say it was an AH move to have your family stay in their rooms without asking. My husband and I just spent Christmas Eve at my BIL\u2019s and were told we could use our 8-year old nephew\u2019s room. But before we did, we asked our nephew if he was ok with it. And if they are using the kids\u2019 rooms at night, why would it be a problem for the kids to go into the rooms during the day? Is your family really so entitled that they need 24/7 exclusive access to rooms belonging to kids they\u2019ve displaced?", "I am shocked by the amount of YTA votes. I think a soft ESH here on both sides (OP and the teenagr step son) is more appropriate.", "YTA. This is their father\u2019s home thus it is also their home. The food thing shouldn\u2019t be that hard. Keep some things in the freezer and non perishables. I can think of many things most teens like to eat that are non-perishable.

But what do you want him to do?  Tell his teenage kid, who just had a fight with his step dad, to find another place to go?  That is pretty fucked up.   Your logic is sound, but it seems like this is just a situation where things are unpredictable.  He is being a good parent to his kids, even if its a bit more stressful for you.  \n\nI'm sure the kids are doing this AT you.", "ESH. It\u2019s great that those kids feel like they have a parent who will welcome them at any time.

If they just pop in, they get done playtime, but then quiet time do your son is ready for bed.  They can help either dinner.  They can help with clean up.  They can help put your son to bed.

It's disruptive to them and sometimes they are sleeping in one bedroom and sometimes in another. They have to adjust to having different people in their lives, different bedrooms, different clothes in the closet, sharing with different people, lots of strange schedules and weird people they don't know in their house and they never asked for any of it just cause their parents can't get their shit together.

Yes YTA, no they don't have to schedule a damn thing to make things more convenient for you and your guests. If you want to have guests there then have a guest room.

I have a son (5) and have full custody.\r\n\nMy bf has 7 kids. He has custody of his youngest 2 (10M/8M) every two weeks. His eldest son is in his late 20s and visits every few weeks with his own kids. His second oldest son is 20 and lives full time with us, he works full-time and pays rent.\r\n\nIt's the middle three's (17M, 16F, 14M) visitation that causes issues.\r\n\nThey have rooms at our house, some visits/custody time is scheduled but most the time they'll randomly show up when they want. Sometimes this is fine, but it also causes issues.\r\n\nA mundane issue is food. I never know how much to buy for the week because I could be feeding 3/5 or 6/8. Many times, I've had no snacks to give the younger boys because the teens had stopped by unannounced or been in the middle of cooking dinner when one of them shows up. Other times they plan to visit and bail last minute and I'll ending up having to waste food.\r\n\nThe unannounced visits also cause disruption to the younger boy\u2019s routine. Sometimes it's just stupid stuff like the boys being kept up by their older siblings or being over excited when they show up before bedtime. The issue happens the other way round and they get disappointed when the teens flake.\r\n\nI've previously brought up my dislike for the unscheduled visits to my bf but he doesn\u2019t see the issue and blows me off.\r\n\nHowever, we recently got into a big fight about it. All bf's kids were supposed to be at their moms for Christmas. The youngest 5 were scheduled to be with us from the 26th.\r\n\nMy parent, 2 sisters, BIL, and 2 nieces stayed with us from the 22nd to the morning of the 26th. This allowed for my family to have space in the house as we only had one kid. My parents are also not the biggest fan of my bf and don't like the number of kids he has so I try to schedule their visits when they aren't around.\r\n\nHowever, on the 23rd the 17 y/o storms into our home after a fight with his stepdad and says he's spending Christmas with us. I tell him he has to sleep on the couch because my parents are in his room, and he throws a hissy fit and basically sulked for the next few days. On the 24th 14 y/o called his dad and also wanted to spend Christmas with us. \r\n\nI didn't want him to because we didn't have enough food/space, and I had originally planned a seperate Christmas for bf's kids on the 26th. We argued for a while, but BF went to pick up his son anyway.\r\n\nIt caused issues like I knew it would. We ran out of food and there was lots of tension between my mom and 17 y/o. He kept going into his room to get stuff and wanting to play on his computer. She told him off multiple times for being rude.\r\n\nThis morning I was complaining to my bf about how they made Christmas so stressful for me and that he needed to get the kids to schedule their visits. He told me I'm being an asshole who just didn't want his kids around for Christmas. I disagreed as it's a year-round issue.\r\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Child support is usually calculated with a formula that not only takes the salaries and how much time they spend in which house into account, but it also looks at how many other mouths the parent has to feed. At least, that's how it is in the Netherlands. If the children are spending significantly more time at your place, the child support should be recalculated.

Or simply serve the food you have and let him see that the kids are all still hungry.", "NTA, but sometimes things cannot be scheduled. Having an almost blended family, teens can be temperamental. Teenage boys EAT a lot! I would make sure that I had lots of extra foods that are easy for the boys to eat, such as frozen pizza's, bags of chicken nuggets, bread (Keep some extra in the freezer), sandwich making stuff (can keep some in the freezer too).", "Time to leave..... if this is all year then either suck it up or figure it out. ... 7 kids and you have 1 way too many kids and it's their dad they will pop up and do as they please....\nYou see this happening but never do anything about it like extra food and whatnot....  complaining and arguing with your boyfriend won't get anywhere look for a place for you and your child and move... \nI'm theres numerous reasons your mom isnt a fan of your boyfriend....", "YTA and your mom is too. 17 yo should have thrown her out of HIS room.", "YTA. \n\nYou're in a relationship with someone who has seven kids and you're surprised it's complicated?", "YTA", "ESH. I think you may be coming off as the asshole because the majority of the household management and emotional labor is falling on you. I think if your bf were in charge of grocery shopping and food budgeting, and in charge of sleeping arrangements for guests, he\u2019d feel differently. I think you are rightfully frustrated with him, but I think you are letting that frustration show itself to his kids. Keep your frustration focused on him and talk about it. I get where you\u2019re coming from. When my ex\u2019s teenage daughter visited for the summer, my ex straight up quit his job to spend time with her. Without discussing it with me. The situation sucks.", "YTA\n\nBuy cans of beans, frozen veg, bags of nuts, and keep extra salad dressing around.

Buy some frozen food or non-perishable snacks and get it through your head that those kids are allowed to come *home*. And ffs, if you're giving away someone's room at Christmas, you need to let them know in advance. It's absolutely fair to put adult humans in an available room when they visit, my kid gets bumped from his room sometimes, but let the child know far enough in advance that they can clean up a bit and put away stuff they don't want other people's parents to touch.", "ESH mostly you for not recognizing that you\u2019re with a dud. \n\nWhy is all the household planning, meal planning etc on you? \n\nYou are failing to recognize that **this is their house and home too**. \n\nThe fact is, you\u2019re treating them like they\u2019re transient because you both as adults don\u2019t have SPACE for all his dang kids. Know what that means? There isn\u2019t space for you or your kid. Nice of you to throw kiddo into this chaos. \n\nYour partner sucks. Your parents know it. **This is not a sustainable situation and you are punishing the kids instead of holding your husband accountable to figuring out actual solutions and logistics to support this ridiculous situation.**", "NTA.\nLooks like your BF has let this get way beyond his control.\nIf this were me, I'd tell my partner to either get control of this or I'm out.\nI cannot function in a constant state of chaos.\nI need peace and order in my daily existence.\nThe end.", "YTA", "YTA just buy foods with a longer shelf life. Also, did you tell the 17yo old that someone would be staying in his room ahead of time?", "YTA--- They have rooms in the house!!! They live there too then, even if it isnt full time!!!", "YTA, I\u2019m afraid.  8 kids are a LOT to handle, but that is what you agreed to when you decided to move in together.  \nYou need to shift your thinking.  This is their home as well as yours.  They don\u2019t \u201cvisit\u201d, they just come home.\nBuy an extra freezer if you have to. Stock it.\nCook with an eye to leftovers always.\nHave more snacks/food that doesn\u2019t go bad stored.\nTALK and plan with your bf about house rules & tasks.\nExpect and embrace a certain level of chaos.

Teens, particularly, are in flux and need their home to be HOME.\n\nIf all this is too much, consider going back to maintaining your own home with just you and your kid and YOU can schedule visiting your bf\u2019s house or vice versa.  \n\nEven if you were married, you have NO RIGHT to dictate when and how often his kids get to come home. \nYTA if you try to.", "YTA thats a problem you should have discussed before you moved in with him...", "I know, right??? \"Ask your dad\" should be the only answer she has. And if she's hosting guests in the kids' rooms, they are guest rooms for the duration. Have a problem? Ask your dad. Many of these men would shape up real quick IF their partners start becoming as lazy as them, with the mental load.", "Not that it\u2019ll change the verdict, but I\u2019m honestly so curious as to how many baby mamas this man has", "Yea. I don\u2019t get why she is managing their food- that\u2019s on him.", "Yes to this! If you are going to have a life with this man, you are going to have to face your mother and tell her that those kids are part of the package. ESH. Teens are difficult. I have a blended family my 3 and his 4 and when his youngest got to high school we got custody of all 4. The older 2 moved on fairly quickly and my 3 have all moved on but his youngest is 24 and still lives with us. She works part time, doesn't pay rent and doesn't really date much. (She has severe social anxiety). My youngest is 6 months younger than her. She is his child, and I'm not saying it hasn't been hard, but I've learned that I can't deal with the fallout that happens to him when one of them gets mad at me. I love him and want him to have the best possible relationship with each of them. I can't stand the idea of them putting him at arms length just to avoid seeing me. Either figure it out or end it or you will watch him suffer over it.", "Yeah. This. Are you the AH? No. NTA. But you\u2019re also fighting a near-hopeless battle trying to make firm plans involving come-and-go teenagers.", "Who the f runs out of food over Christmas? No one is that precise", "Yup. We go overseas to visit my sister, who has almost as many kids. My parents and I stay in her teenagers' rooms. During the day, we stay OUT of their rooms so they can have their privacy back. And if we want to fetch something out of a bag or whatever, we knock and ask permission. Because it's so, so important that they feel that their boundaries are being respected. WE are the visitors, NOT THEM. It is their home. \n\nNo matter how many children OP's boyfriend has, they are not \"visiting\"...it's their HOME. And they need to feel that way, not like they have to \"schedule visits\".", "Good for your dad!

At any time one or more of the shared custody kids may want to stay longer with him and it is his job to provide safe haven for them. She knew about all 7 when she got with him.", "This is the answer. It's the kids' home. They're not visitors. At the same time, it shouldn't all be on OP to manage all the things with unexpected and unpredictable arrivals and departures. Her husband needs to step up and parent his kids and make sure they have enough food, etc.", "yeah i was thinking in general nta but that detail made this an easy yta situation. if he\u2019s not standing over MIL while she\u2019s asleep, he should be allowed to have access to his own room. is she spending the entire day in there? does she think the kids stop existing in a space if she\u2019s there visiting? i think in general\ndad needs to be the one to worry about his kids having enough food and not depleting resources, but that is the kids\u2019 home whether they\u2019re there or not. if something volatile happened at the other house, were they supposed to pencil that in or just stay in it because their home is off limits when OP isn\u2019t expecting them?", "Also your mum is a jerk. She \u201chad a problem\u201d with the 17 year old. Sounds like the mum is as immature as the OP.", "Yup, she needs to stop referring to having his children come home as \"their visits\". They are not \"visiting\". They are his children, as much as her son is her child. That is their HOME, when they are there and when they are not.", "Exactly\u2014I think the bigger issue is that living with a man who has SEVEN KIDS is a nightmare. Especially in a relationship where you have ended up taking on a big share of the domestic labor that arises from their presence in what has to be their home too.", ">Many of these men would shape up real quick IF their partners start becoming as lazy as them, with the mental load.\n\nBingo", "I've read that one, and that one is just... holy shit why are people like this", "No it doesn\u2019t.  It\u2019s called leftovers.

That's leftovers (bonus food!).", "They have a limited amount of freezer space, and not everything freezes well", "She is also a resident of the home. She is not the home owner.

If my step mom had somewhere to be or if I was blasting music and being loud, I would 100% say her reaction was justified. \n\nIdk i don\u2019t see the problem either\ud83d\ude02 thank you for making me feel a little less crazy about it", "By that logic most people living in apartments are second class citizens. I can hear my upstairs and downstairs neighbors showering due to how the noise travels but I'm not going knocking on their doors for being inconsiderate, cause I'm not insane. It's water not an air horn.", "Loud enough for someone who was already awake to know. It's not like she woke the house. No, dad's wife just wanted to bitch about the teen.", "None of that discounts my point that it's her home but okie dokie.", "He probably makes her life easier financially.", "He made her fall in love with him?

If it\u2019s loud enough to hear on the other side of a house it is probably too loud for 1am. \n\nAnd most apartments do have rules around noise based on a conventional schedule. It does make things harder for people who work unconventional hours (no argument there). \n\nIn this case we know OPs shower was loud enough to be heard on the other side of the house. We also know she wasn\u2019t working a night job and needed to shower at that time. It\u2019s not unreasonable for someone to ask that loud activities don\u2019t happen in the middle of the night. It is unreasonable to threaten to divorce someone because they dated ask you (not even your kid directly) to ask them to not shower in the middle of the night. \n\nOP rubs me the wrong way because she seems so smug about it, without realizing the abusive dynamic her stepmom was living in.", "On Christmas of all days she should have said it\u2019s okay.
