I have a son (5) and have full custody.\r\n\nMy bf has 7 kids. He has custody of his youngest 2 (10M/8M) every two weeks. His eldest son is in his late 20s and visits every few weeks with his own kids. His second oldest son is 20 and lives full time with us, he works full-time and pays rent.\r\n\nIt's the middle three's (17M, 16F, 14M) visitation that causes issues.\r\n\nThey have rooms at our house, some visits/custody time is scheduled but most the time they'll randomly show up when they want. Sometimes this is fine, but it also causes issues.\r\n\nA mundane issue is food. I never know how much to buy for the week because I could be feeding 3/5 or 6/8. Many times, I've had no snacks to give the younger boys because the teens had stopped by unannounced or been in the middle of cooking dinner when one of them shows up. Other times they plan to visit and bail last minute and I'll ending up having to waste food.\r\n\nThe unannounced visits also cause disruption to the younger boy\u2019s routine. Sometimes it's just stupid stuff like the boys being kept up by their older siblings or being over excited when they show up before bedtime. The issue happens the other way round and they get disappointed when the teens flake.\r\n\nI've previously brought up my dislike for the unscheduled visits to my bf but he doesn\u2019t see the issue and blows me off.\r\n\nHowever, we recently got into a big fight about it. All bf's kids were supposed to be at their moms for Christmas. The youngest 5 were scheduled to be with us from the 26th.\r\n\nMy parent, 2 sisters, BIL, and 2 nieces stayed with us from the 22nd to the morning of the 26th. This allowed for my family to have space in the house as we only had one kid. My parents are also not the biggest fan of my bf and don't like the number of kids he has so I try to schedule their visits when they aren't around.\r\n\nHowever, on the 23rd the 17 y/o storms into our home after a fight with his stepdad and says he's spending Christmas with us. I tell him he has to sleep on the couch because my parents are in his room, and he throws a hissy fit and basically sulked for the next few days. On the 24th 14 y/o called his dad and also wanted to spend Christmas with us. \r\n\nI didn't want him to because we didn't have enough food/space, and I had originally planned a seperate Christmas for bf's kids on the 26th. We argued for a while, but BF went to pick up his son anyway.\r\n\nIt caused issues like I knew it would. We ran out of food and there was lots of tension between my mom and 17 y/o. He kept going into his room to get stuff and wanting to play on his computer. She told him off multiple times for being rude.\r\n\nThis morning I was complaining to my bf about how they made Christmas so stressful for me and that he needed to get the kids to schedule their visits. He told me I'm being an asshole who just didn't want his kids around for Christmas. I disagreed as it's a year-round issue.\r", "created_utc": 1703728184, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18sht7l/aita_for_wanting_my_boyfriends_kids_to_schedule/", "score": 91, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Hard stop. \n\nIt sounds like you need better boundaries, not less kids. For instance, stock up on non perishables for when kids show up unexpectedly. Buy when it's on sale and keep a stash on hand. If the little need to go to bed, institute quiet time and your BF needs to help hold the line with the teenagers about that. Actually, your BF should be doing the shopping and creating safe boundaries - they are his kids. \n\nThis is about being a better parent, not excluding the teenagers from a place that is legitimately their home as well.", "YTA - your boyfriend needs a vasectomy and you need to find an age appropriate man who buys his own groceries for his kids.", "YTA", "YTA. Will you insist that your son schedule his visits when he gets older? If you didn\u2019t want to live in chaos, you should not have gotten with a man with SEVEN children.", "YTA.\n\nMaybe we come from a different culture but I don't think people would like you very much here.\n\nFood not enough? Just buy more food. When people come over unannounced, I either cook some more food or if I'm too tired, I just ordered them and have them delivered.\n\nFood not eaten? Put them in the fridge or give them to neighbours, or cats, or dogs.\n\nNot enough space, let them share the space. I agree with your husband, these are all a non-issue.", "From a kid\u2019s perspective here. My dad remarried when I was 9 (now 22). I\u2019m an only child. My parents had split custody of me but my dad always made it extremely clear that his house was always open to me, 24 hours a day 7 days a week. No matter what. (I lived primarily with my mom). \n\nMy dads wife never made comments about when I could or couldn\u2019t be at my (his) house. But I vividly remember her and my dad getting into a viscous argument over her being pissed off that I decided to shower at 1 am. My bathroom and room were on the second floor, theirs was in the first. She was awake and heard me going to shower. \n\nShe told my dad that there was absolutely no reason that I needed to shower at 1 am. My dad blew up in her face and told her that it was my house, that I had grew up in, and that if I wanted to shower at 1am, 2am, or 3am then I very much could do that. She didn\u2019t like that. \n\nMy dad was very adamant that, I, as his daughter, will always come first. He always says he is a dad first and a husband second. \n\nI say all this because my dad was ready to sign divorce papers over my step mom being mad about what time I was showering. Had she EVER, and I mean EVER, even slightly suggested that I must only come over on scheduled times, my dad would\u2019ve divorced her before she could even finish her sentence. \n\nI can understand your stress with all of it but YOU got yourself involved with someone who had (7!!!) kids. Just because you exist in his world now, does not mean his kids get booted. You should be over the moon that your boyfriends kids feel safe enough and comfortable enough to go their dad (and you) when things aren\u2019t going right. They view their dad and your home as a safe space. \n\nYou chose to be with someone knowing he had children. You moved in with someone knowing he had children. His children are not guests, they are his children. Your mother also has some gall to be in the 17 YO\u2019s face about going into HIS room. \n\nYTA. 100%. Your boyfriend seems like a stand up dad. Not everyone can say that their dad defends them and is there for them but at least his 7 kids can. I\u2019m glad he fought you on this. Good for him.", "NTA it absolutely sounds reasonable to want to know what everyone is doing so that you can plan accordingly.", "Wow!  I have two kids full time and was worried that it would be tough to find a woman who would be ok with that, but 7?  7 friggin kids?  Geeze!  That\u2019s crazy.  \n\nNTA!  He should be doing everything in his power to keep you happy and doing a little scheduling to prevent food issues seems like the bare minimum.", "I get the impression there is also a significant age gap between you and your boyfriend.\n\nRegardless, you've only been around for 4 years, all of his kids predate you and your preferences. If he's a decent parent, which it sounds like he is, his home should always be a refuge for his minor children, for when things go wrong at their other home and they want to come back to his. I understand that their presence and absence is hard to plan around, but that's what having teenagers is like.\n\nIt sounds like you need to adopt a more flexible approach. Get some longer life snacks that you can keep on hand in case your weekly shop doesn't end up having enough. Buy an extra bag of apples, and turn any left over into stewed apples or apple cake etc, or oranges and juice the spare. Plan meals (especially around highly emotionally charged events like Christmas) with ways that they can be stretched to feed a few more at short notice, and plan to package and freeze leftovers. More importantly get your boyfriend involved in cooking and planning. Send him to the shops to get the extra things you now need given you have extra mouths to feed.\n\nIf you're having guests, have a plan for what happens if his kids need their rooms.\n\nYou're not going to succeed in getting the teenagers to only visit on schedule. Life isn't like that. YTA", "ESH.  When his kids come unexpectedly your bf should either immediately go and get more food or they can stop with him when he goes to pick them up.  It allows them to be part of the family and models courtesy.  He sucks for not helping to manage supplies for spontaneous visits.\n\nNext time you should have your family stay in a nearby hotel if they disdain your husband and his kids so much.  Or get a blow up bed and some camping foldaway cots and make sure a visitors know that you don't always know the visit schedule.  Or ask permission from the older kids in advance  and offer them the cots/inflatable beds.  Your family suck for imposing like that treating your boyfriend's kids poorly.\n\nHowever, YTA too for being hostile and resentful about this as well as offering rooms to your family when you know well schedules change all the time since that's what you are complaining about.  You also should have handled your mother and made sure she wasn't imposing on your boyfriend's child and should have made it clear in no uncertain terms that she may not \"tell off\" your boyfriend's child. Your choosing this.  If you don't like it anymore you should separate.  Or do you rely on your husband and his son's income?  Maybe your family will help you since they don't like your bf or his children.", "7 kids -- 7 kids WTF", "YTA/ they have the right to their dad anytime they want. That\u2019s what a dad is supposed to be\u2026 WTF are you you thinking that your boyfriend\u2019s kids need an appointment?!?", "This is a logistical nightmare. Your BF needs to work with the kids to set a schedule of some kind. He also needs to be in charge of buying food and planning meals.  I know some people say kids don't need a schedule to see their parents but holidays are different due to things like your family coming in town. What if you guys have a weekend away planned. So yes some communication about schedules is needed.  If he won't work with you reconsider this relationship..", "It is every divorced parents dream that their teenage children want to spend unscheduled time with them. And you want to put a stop to it? The 17-year-old will be off to college in a year\u2026 This is literally the last year that the kid will likely do this\u2026 And you want to stop it? Don\u2019t have your parents stay in his kids bedrooms anymore and book them a nice hotel or Airbnb, especially since they apparently don\u2019t approve of your boyfriend, or his children . Stock up on snacks, and most of all apologize to your husband and his stepson. You are so far out of line. Keep this up and boyfriend is likely kicking you to the curb as he should.YTA.", "YTA.  This is what happens when you date someone with 7 kids.", "I can't come to a judgement as it isn't clear why you are the caterer for this family. I would step back from that role and let dad make sure his kids are fed.", "YTA. The kids obviously feel close to and safe with their dad. Before anything else, he\u2019s their dad - they are his #1 priority. So if they want to come stay with him, he should welcome them with open arms. By extension, that means you must be receptive to their presence. Stock up on dry goods for the pantry and go to the store if they show up and you don\u2019t have enough food. If they don\u2019t come as planned, use your freezer. \n\nAs for Christmas, I\u2019ll just say it was an AH move to have your family stay in their rooms without asking. My husband and I just spent Christmas Eve at my BIL\u2019s and were told we could use our 8-year old nephew\u2019s room. But before we did, we asked our nephew if he was ok with it. And if they are using the kids\u2019 rooms at night, why would it be a problem for the kids to go into the rooms during the day? Is your family really so entitled that they need 24/7 exclusive access to rooms belonging to kids they\u2019ve displaced?", "I am shocked by the amount of YTA votes. I think a soft ESH here on both sides (OP and the teenagr step son) is more appropriate.", "YTA. This is their father\u2019s home thus it is also their home. The food thing shouldn\u2019t be that hard. Keep some things in the freezer and non perishables. I can think of many things most teens like to eat that are non-perishable. You just don\u2019t want them in what you perceive as your home but it\u2019s their home too. Don\u2019t be with a man with kids if you can\u2019t embrace them.", "YTA\n\nThey\u2019re his kids. One was having problems with his stepdad, of course your bf is going to take care of his kid. If this wasn\u2019t a problem for you, you shouldn\u2019t have gotten with a man with so many kids and unpredictable schedules.", "NAH. \n\nI mean, this is kind of being the parent of teenagers.  \n\nI get your point.  But what do you want him to do?  Tell his teenage kid, who just had a fight with his step dad, to find another place to go?  That is pretty fucked up.   Your logic is sound, but it seems like this is just a situation where things are unpredictable.  He is being a good parent to his kids, even if its a bit more stressful for you.  \n\nI'm sure the kids are doing this AT you.", "ESH. It\u2019s great that those kids feel like they have a parent who will welcome them at any time. It does however suck, that you\u2019re unable to accommodate food and sleeping arrangements, and your other kids get disappointed when they don\u2019t show up. \n\nIf it wasn\u2019t 7 kids, I doubt this would be an issue, but 7 is a lot to plan for. \n\nI don\u2019t know if there\u2019s a good fix for any of this, without making the kids feel like their father is picking a partner over them.", ">My boyfriend has 7 kids.\n\n*record scratch*\n\nWhat?\n\nFor your Q, YTA.

If they just pop in, they get done playtime, but then quiet time do your son is ready for bed.  They can help either dinner.  They can help with clean up.  They can help put your son to bed.

They have two homes, two bedrooms, two living spaces. It's not their mom's home and their dad's home, it's their two homes. It's disruptive to them and sometimes they are sleeping in one bedroom and sometimes in another. They have to adjust to having different people in their lives, different bedrooms, different clothes in the closet, sharing with different people, lots of strange schedules and weird people they don't know in their house and they never asked for any of it just cause their parents can't get their shit together. You knew he had 7 children when you decided to make a life with him, now you have to live with the consequences. Hopefully he got a vascetomy at some point. Yes YTA, no they don't have to schedule a damn thing to make things more convenient for you and your guests. If you want to have guests there then have a guest room. If you want to know how much food to have, use a freezer and canned goods.

You can try to address the specific issues like food etc, but what you\u2019re wanting is going to make them feel like they aren\u2019t wanted. Which is a shitty thing to do to a kid. You married a man with 7 kids. You knew what you were signing up for. Also the 17 going in and out of his room to get stuff shouldn\u2019t be a big deal.

I have a son (5) and have full custody.\r\n\nMy bf has 7 kids. He has custody of his youngest 2 (10M/8M) every two weeks. His eldest son is in his late 20s and visits every few weeks with his own kids. His second oldest son is 20 and lives full time with us, he works full-time and pays rent.\r\n\nIt's the middle three's (17M, 16F, 14M) visitation that causes issues.\r\n\nThey have rooms at our house, some visits/custody time is scheduled but most the time they'll randomly show up when they want. Sometimes this is fine, but it also causes issues.\r\n\nA mundane issue is food. I never know how much to buy for the week because I could be feeding 3/5 or 6/8. Many times, I've had no snacks to give the younger boys because the teens had stopped by unannounced or been in the middle of cooking dinner when one of them shows up. Other times they plan to visit and bail last minute and I'll ending up having to waste food.\r\n\nThe unannounced visits also cause disruption to the younger boy\u2019s routine. Sometimes it's just stupid stuff like the boys being kept up by their older siblings or being over excited when they show up before bedtime. The issue happens the other way round and they get disappointed when the teens flake.\r\n\nI've previously brought up my dislike for the unscheduled visits to my bf but he doesn\u2019t see the issue and blows me off.\r\n\nHowever, we recently got into a big fight about it. All bf's kids were supposed to be at their moms for Christmas. The youngest 5 were scheduled to be with us from the 26th.\r\n\nMy parent, 2 sisters, BIL, and 2 nieces stayed with us from the 22nd to the morning of the 26th. This allowed for my family to have space in the house as we only had one kid. My parents are also not the biggest fan of my bf and don't like the number of kids he has so I try to schedule their visits when they aren't around.\r\n\nHowever, on the 23rd the 17 y/o storms into our home after a fight with his stepdad and says he's spending Christmas with us. I tell him he has to sleep on the couch because my parents are in his room, and he throws a hissy fit and basically sulked for the next few days. On the 24th 14 y/o called his dad and also wanted to spend Christmas with us. \r\n\nI didn't want him to because we didn't have enough food/space, and I had originally planned a seperate Christmas for bf's kids on the 26th. We argued for a while, but BF went to pick up his son anyway.\r\n\nIt caused issues like I knew it would. We ran out of food and there was lots of tension between my mom and 17 y/o. He kept going into his room to get stuff and wanting to play on his computer. She told him off multiple times for being rude.\r\n\nThis morning I was complaining to my bf about how they made Christmas so stressful for me and that he needed to get the kids to schedule their visits. He told me I'm being an asshole who just didn't want his kids around for Christmas. I disagreed as it's a year-round issue.\r\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
