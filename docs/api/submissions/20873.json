We have been saving money for this wedding almost the whole year, but the problem arose last month. One thing I forgot to mention was the Trust I have. I have this because I have seen what can happen in a divorce and in other legal issues. An important thing to mention is that I got this a while ago. My older brother is the trustee, and I am his trustee. This is important because any money I make from my job, I have them send it to my trust. I am registered as an employee of the trust, and it pays me $1,200 a week as my spending money. I put roughly 70% of that into our joint account. Last month, however, my soon-to-be wife told me to put more money in the joint account. So of course I did. Last week, she came up to me and said I needed to get rid of my trust completely and give her full access to everything in it. She said that by having it, it feels like I don't trust her.

She could still live quite well without you either as a single person, or with another partner that makes less than you but closer to what she makes. \n\nSo unless you have some massive inheritance you haven\u2019t mentioned, I don\u2019t think she\u2019s \u201cafter your money\u201d you make a solid income but again not life changing compared to the lifestyle she could have without you. \n\nYet she contributes a larger share of her income to the joint account. You are each adding the same dollar amount, not percentage of your respective incomes. And meanwhile you have the trust. \n\nIt\u2019s one thing to put assets earned prior to the marriage in a trust for protection, but you apparently intend to continue to contribute your annual income to the trust during the marriage and using a modest weekly payment from it toward your marriage and family. \n\nThat means that, as you guys go through the future and purchase a home, have children, encounter medical expenses etc, all of her money is on the line for the family whether in the shared account or not, while a large portion of your earnings are locked up for you only. Not to mention if she takes an additional earnings hit by taking time off to raise your kids. And even if her income soars and she makes more than you- you\u2019ll claim it as community if earned during the marriage while you continued to hoard your earnings with the trust. \n\nShe is guaranteed to get screwed in the divorce especially if there are kids involved by then, unless a prenup does somehow take into account your earnings post wedding whether or not you have contributed then to the trust. \n\nI personally would not enter this agreement with someone unless they substantially increased their regular contribution to the shared account.", "Putting your salary into a trust doesn't mean that money isn't marital income. I'm not sure what your purpose was in doing this but I don't think it has the effect you think.  \n\nSpeak to an attorney about a prenup and how you protect your assets. \n\nHousing and living expenses should be split based on a percent of income.  So each of you puts (for example) 25% of your salary toward joint expenses.  That means you contribute more if you make more.  Use it for mortgage. Taxes. Vacation,  pet expenses, entertainment, food, bills and  whatever else you cover jointly.  Anything left over at the end of the year, pay toward the mortgage principal to pay off the mortgage faster. Or move it to your next year's vacation fund or whatever else you want to do with it.", "You all need to make a budget and decide how expenses are paid.

And your wife is going to contribute her entire income to your joint account?\n\nHow much is she contributing? Could the salary that you earn contribute to your lifestyle? What will you do when you have children?\n\nThe original amount in your trust is absolutely yours. But attempting to avoid sharing your income during your marriage by depositing it in your trust is sleazy and manipulative.", "It\u2019s definitely an unusual setup but I don\u2019t think it makes you an asshole.

Everyone wants to believe that their love is the exception to the rule. While I don't agree with her, I have empathy for her fear here now that she feels that you don't fully trust her and maybe this is all a mistake that you're getting cold feet about. This is as much a red flag for her as it is for you.\n\nI know it's frustrating, but you're not likely to come to a middle on this. She has to decide on her own if this is a dealbreaker for her. But whatever you do, don't cave. This is important to you and she needs to understand that it's not personal. Encourage her to set up her own account that you can't access: it's only fair to her that she also has something to fall back on.", "YTA you should be contributing the same percentage of your income to your life together not just the same amount. Crazy. I would not marry you if I were her. She's pulling more than her fair share of the weight.", "Unpopular opinion. YTA  you\u2019re putting approximately 1/4 of your income into shared income how much is she putting in? I\u2019m not sure that your plan really works. If you\u2019re putting your income into a trust I would think she could still sue in the case of divorce for half the marital assets. With that being money earned during the course of the marriage it would be. Definitely not an attorney but would think this could apply.", "YTA - Normally I would say red flag for how she is behaving and totally support protecting you wealth in case of divorce. However, you're making her pull more than her share of the financial weight, so of course she is frustrated. You keep acting unfair like you have been and you'll definitely need that divorce protection.", "YTA. She\u2019s right. This isn\u2019t the foundation for a healthy marriage.

I think it is prudent to have an honest conversation about finances and how you both feel about contributing towards a shared household. It is an important relational step to ensure you are on the same page. There\u2019s a reason why money is the number one cause of relationship failure. My wife and I opened a joint account but kept our own separate accounts as well. Each household has their own system, but however you work it out, it should be discussed and agreed upon fully. Best of luck.", "Welcome to the primary cause of relationship breakdown: different expectations over finances. \n\nYou\u2019re NTA, however I would not marry if this issue remains a sticking point. It\u2019s perfectly fine to have a line drawn between shared money and money you keep for yourself, however, if she has different expectations, you gotta work that out between you. Do you make significantly more than her, and do you have full access to her money the way she wants from you? Does she put the same amount of money into the shared account despite making less (and therefore she keeps less of her own money? Whatever the situation is, finances are something you absolutely have to agree on.", "NAH. It's your money not hers. She is in no position to demand anything and throw a tantrum. You are maintaining what was already the status quo. What she previously decided to marry into even. Changing it because she doesn't feel you trust her is her basically saying you didn't trust her the whole relationship which is absurd. If she didn't feel this mistrust before she shouldn't be feeling it now. She needs to have some solo time with a therapist and you both should have couple time with a separate therapist and work out these kinks before marriage. \n\nBottom line though, she isn't entitled to your trust just because she's marrying you and as a woman in today's world should know better than to try and force that kind of control on someone else. Full stop.\n\nAlso, please don't neglect a prenup.", "Yta. Don\u2019t get married if you don\u2019t trust your fianc\u00e9, and/or sign a prenup. But if she\u2019s putting all of her earnings into a joint account, and you aren\u2019t at least matching that when you make more, that\u2019s an issue. why don\u2019t you care that she feels more vulnerable? Post in r/legal because you may be breaking the trust anyway upon marriage depending on where you live. If you already had kids with someone else that you needed to prioritize, or there was a huge inheritance, I\u2019d understand more. I actually do have a trust- and my husband and I are co-beneficiaries. We do actually trust each other though.", "NAH Stand your ground. Why is she pressing you have a trust or technically like a nest egg? Seems shady to me.", "NTA. I never had a trust, but I got married at 23 and my wife insisted that we combine our finances. I disagreed, but gave in, because I loved her and wanted her to marry me. 15 years later she divorced me because she didn\u2019t like the things I was spending money on. Lesson learned.", "NAH yet.  \n\nHave a heart to heart and come to agreement on finances.\n\nGenerally speaking.  It tends to be whatever you have before marriage stays with you and everything after marriage is split 50/50.  You probably want to then get it into a prenup whatever you decide.\n\nI have done no research into it, but I would be surprised if just putting it into a trust will suddenly make it safe.
