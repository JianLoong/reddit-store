Now, about the TV issue, they don't have any right to hog up the TV or start talking badly about you when you ask them to keep it down. It's your TV and you were kind enough to allow them to use it. That means that offer can be retracted at any time. If they want one, they can go and buy one themselves, or they can simply respect you and be normal, considerate roommates.\n\nIn college, I've taken my things out of the common area when they weren't treated respectfully. Like my toaster, when my idiot roommate put frozen pizza bagels in it, apparently thinking this was a smart idea, and almost ended up starting a fire and nearly ruined my toaster- it stunk up the whole apartment with burnt cheese smell and left a whole mess inside, which I was luckily able to clean. She then proceeded to lie about it and say she didn't do that (there were only three of us and I knew my other roommate wasn't that stupid). So she lost toaster privileges.

You might want to think about a lock for your door too", "NTA. *Ugh,* __*roommates.*__\n\nMaybe...if you have any relatives nearby, tell your roommates the TV was a loaner and your relatives requested it back (and move it out). That's assuming you have a smaller TV for your personal room.\nI know it's not fair, but it sounds like you're not getting to use the living room TV anyway. It may help circumvent some of the drama, and protect your TV from sabotage since you don't have a room lock (wtf?). \n\nThe dishes thing? Your roommates need to GTF over themselves. Wtf does \"kindness in the heart\" have to do with dishes? One day won't kill anyone, and I personally don't consider it rude unless it's (A) not your home, (B) they own the dirty dishes [and control issues], or (C) obstructing the sink/interfering with their dishwashing. When I was in college I had two AH roommates who would leave their dishes in the sink for DAYS; a weekend or longer! It starts to smell and yeah, not enough room for my dishes. I finally put their dirty dishes in a bag and left it by the trash bin (inside our apartment). Days later: \"do you know where my dishes went?\" \"Yeah, I didn't think you wanted them anymore, so I put them by the trash.\" I didn't actually toss them, and definitely not after just one or two minor issues.\n\nAnother maybe... you or your non-psychotic roommate could keep a small shallow plastic bin in your room (under the bed or something) for dirty dishes if you don't have time to clean them right away. Just to avoid exposure to another nuclear event. You shouldn't have to walk on the eggshells of the bullshit your roommates are hatching.", "Take the TV out of that area.
