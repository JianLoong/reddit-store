Getting everything was quite the mess, especially because our family evolved to have more than 3 different cultures in us. The trip first took us to Europe, where I translated for the most part. It was exhausting. So exhausting in fact, that when we circled around to Hawaii, I couldn\u2019t walk for more than 5 minutes without a break. Worst part, I\u2019m allergic to seafood. And all my so caring family wanted to eat was SEAFOOD. I also had to be an English translator here. Eventually, I was surviving on whatever I can get my hands on, which was really only the ocasional french fries from fish and chips and what else. But then, we had some stupid beach run competiton, where everyone had to compete. So, I began running. And running. Until I couldn\u2018t handle it, and passed out completely. Like out cold. I was rushed to ER, where the doctor just said to eat more. Everyone was relived, except for one part of the family. My mom\u2019s younger sister. She has 3 kids, between the ages of 4-7. And they were mad. Like steaming mad. The kids kept crying about how the beach race was cut short, and how they wanted MORE SEAFOOD. So of course, my aunt haaddd to lay it on me. But everyone payed it back on them. So now began screaming that I was an a\\*\\*hole who got the entire family against them. We haven\u2019t cut contact, but it has been chaotic to say the least. Everyone just stays in their room now. But my aunt keeps texting me that I\u2019m an a\\*\\*hole. So, AITA?
