Last night, before it was known this opportunity had been lost, we had discussed cooking the burgers in the fridge that were about to go bad. Even though I knew he was feeling crappy, I thought this was still the dinner plan, so I called him shortly before leaving work letting him know that I was gonna get some hamburger buns and cheese at the grocery store on my way home if he could start the grill soon. He was not happy that I expected him to grill when he feels so poorly. We had a little spat that ended with me saying \u201cWell fine just don\u2019t worry about it then\u201d fully intending on cooking them myself (a fun little experiment seeing how I\u2019ve never used a charcoal grill.) When I got home he told me that he felt like I was being selfish by requesting he make dinner and I said he was being selfish by even putting up a fight, over a cold. So what do you guys think, Am I the ass hole for making my down in the dumps/head cold ridden fianc\u00e9 grill dinner? \n\nHe said the internet agrees with him so we\u2019ll see.\n\n\nEdit: To all the people with creative ideas on how to cook burgers on the stove and in the oven or make meatloaf or all these awesome backup plans.

Why force him to cook?\n\nYou could have pan-fried or broiled the hamburgers if you didn't know how to use the charcoal grill.

It's not like you weren't stopping at the grocers on your way home anyway.", "YTA. He didn\u2019t feel well and it doesn\u2019t sound like you had sympathy for that.

No wonder it turned into a spat he might not have felt listened to", "YTA.\n\nDon't make sick people cook food.", "Actually this is a close one for me. It is hard to tell just how disabled someone with a cold is, including oneself, and perhaps you do not know too well what it is like when your fiance is feeling ill.\n\nMy vote is YTA, because while there was nothing wrong with *asking*, since you had already made such plans, he said no, and quite reasonably, and you did not take that initial no for an answer.", "YTA. He\u2019s sick. Give him a freaking break. This was a moment you could show your caring and loving and untiring nature to this man you are going to marry. \n\nAlso even if you can\u2019t use a grill get out a frying pan and cook them on there improvise. You truly thought it was appropriate to expect this sick man to go and grill and made it a huge thing?", "Kinda going YTA for making a sick and likely a little depressed person make food that you are also capable of making. When my wife is feeling that way I usually try to make things easier for them rather than harder.", "YTA \n\nThere's more than one way to cook a burger,  good grief. \n\nYour lack of empathy is kinda sad. \n\n\"Well fine just don't worry about it then\" \nUgh That sentence is always a sentence used by an AH.", "YTA.

What you should have done, was make his comfort food. chicken soup or mac and cheese, or whatever he likes to eat that night. You could have cuddled with him in bed, or on the sofa, and gave him the comfort that all of us need at some point. This was your chance to show him your love and support and sympathy. burgers can be tossed out. instead you tossed out an opportunity. \nOn the practical side of this:\nIf you had no intention of cooking the burgers until they were about to spoil, they should have stayed in the freezer. \n\nFrying pans exist. You could have been 'fancy' and caramelized some onions in the beef juices left over in the pan, it tastes amazing. You could have gotten fries and onion rings to fry or bake, for a side. If this was something you both enjoy you could have made a real treat out of it. \n\nIf you like the charcoal flavoring, there are tricks to smoking a charcoal under burgers to give them that taste without the grill.", "Umm yeah. YTA. Imagine if the roles were reversed. Well, as a woman, I can assume that you do know how it feels.

On top of that, he was pretty bummed about something. Not sure what that something is so it could be anything from a huge promotion he worked his ass off for to like.... idk... tickets to a game or something. Either way, if whatever he missed out on was important enough to him that it put him down plus he had a cold, even if he could technically drag his ass up to make burgers, I'm sure he would appreciate if you didn't demand him to. Plus when he said he didn't want to, it sounds like you pushed him on it. You probably should have just taken that as a cue that today's not the day and comfort him a bit. Maybe if he squeezes sympathy for a whole week, you might be able to tell him that's enough. But on day one? Try to empathize! Even just to make him feel better!", "YTA. Expecting anyone to cook when they're sick or when they've gotten bad news is just plain selfish!! Make them yourself on the stove top or in the oven on a broiler pan if you don't know how to grill.", "YTA. He was sick. And just had a bad thing happen. That's a good excuse to not make dinner. You don't ask a sick person to make dinner. Or at least, you could ask. Are you still up for grilling? And take no for an answer. Also making hamburgers is incredibly easy and if you didn't feel comfortable using the grill, you could've made them on the stove or used the meat in a different recipe you feel comfortable with. When someone is sick and you're well, you should try to take care of dinner.", "YTA. He\u2019s not only bummed about the lost opportunity but also physically not feeling well\u2026 just cook the burgers on the stove if you\u2019re not confident in grilling or order takeout.

Imagine if he asked you to do things while you were real sick.", "YTA. You couldn't have just cooked them in the frying pan when you got home?\n\nNobody wants to cook when they're sick unless they have to. 5 seconds on Google and you'll probably have a half dozen (or more) ways to cook burgers without the grill.", "Yta ew why do you want a suck person handling your food?  You are completely capable of cooking burgers yourself.", "So, did you intend on cooking? Or did you just want them to start the grill and not cook.

Get your self a meat thermometer and use google.", "YTA: I get you had an \"unsympathetic moment\" here, and you can't cook well. The thing is, cooking the burger meat that will go bad even poorly was the better option. It shows a desire for self improvement, and shows that you're not willing to put your task list as a higher importance than your fiancee being sick and having a vulnerable moment. Even throwing it away would have been more considerate of your fiancee. It's nice you want to cheer him up and the grandma thing was how you did it, but it's just not the same. It's not weighted the same. \n\nEven the statement of \"well fine, don't worry about it,\" is adversarial, let alone not expressing you would just do it yourself. \n\nHe had another vulnerable moment where he expressed that he felt like you were being selfish, and you weopinized that to turn it on him and tell him he's being selfish for not just accepting the chores you hand out to him. \n\nSo really it wasn't one unsympathetic moment in the end, it was several. Unsympathetic to him being ill (giving him a chore to do when you didn't have to), unsympathetic when he said no, and unsympathetic when he expressed how he felt you were behaving toward him. There are several spots here where you were in fact behaving selfishly: asking him to do a chore because \"he's better at it\"*, putting your need to accomplish a task above his need for rest and decompression, and being so focused on yourself that you can't take the time to reflect internally.\n\n*Sounds like weopinized incompetence to me.

What do you think?\" instead he immediately attacked OP with accusations of selfishness and lack of care when OP wasn't able to read his mind. Sure OP is guilty of becoming defensive after being attacked, but Hubby is the one who really failed to communicate his feelings or wants.

Don't you think that makes you an hypocrite?\n\nAnother thing that bothered me is that you seem to think that a person has to \"power through\" and still do everything in their to do list even if they are feeling down or sick. If that's the standard that you want to set for yourself, that's your prerogative, but you don't get to set that standard for other people. It's ok to take one day off to be sad, the chores will still be there to be done, the world won't implode. You're basically asking him to compartmentalize his feelings and wait for the weekend so he can have free time to feel down, and maybe you're capable of doing it, but not everybody is.
