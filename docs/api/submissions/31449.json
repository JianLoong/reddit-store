I mean like long\u201410 or 11 minutes, the kids were terrible and had to be pointed in the right direction, one kid cried\u2026maybe it was expected to suck but if sucked. My nephew rocked his little play however and was really happy to see us. About midway through the next one we realized we we couldn\u2019t do another hour or this so we got up and left. We tried to be quiet but when six adults stand up off cafeteria furniture it\u2019s more commotion than we wanted but we left.\n\nWhen we got out in the parking lot some burly dad type had followed us out and told us we needed to learn some manners. Dave asked him what his problem was. He said you ruined the play for the next kids and we could have waited for intermission. We said we had no idea when that was. He said look at the program. I said we are new to this and didn\u2019t know. He said, and I quote: \u201casswipe, don\u2019t come back if you can\u2019t treat kindergarteners with respect.\u201d  Dave\u2019s date implored is to get in the car so we did.\n\nMy sister called me and said we caused quite a stir among the PTA gossips and said she saw us leave but wanted my side of the story about what happened in the parking lot.

You are incredibly immature.", "You\u2019re kind of the asshole. It makes sense that you didn\u2019t really know what was going on, but maybe reading the program would\u2019ve been a good idea. Or perhaps even asking around to see how long the show would be if you were unaware? That kind of stuff can make a kid feel bad. Even if they don\u2019t fully understand now, it\u2019s moments like those that they\u2019ll look back on and think \u201chuh\u2026that wasn\u2019t very nice.\u201d", "YTA\n\nFirst time or not, you check the program. Guessing you all went to school and had programs as well, at least up til grade 6 or 8. So you know parents come and wait. \n\nBut guy who came out was also an AH. Like not the way to create a teachable moment", "You and your friends are assholes here. There is no doubt. Parking lot dad was absolutely right but also an overbearing asshole.\n\nESH.\n\nDon't do that to children. Don't do that to professionals. Just don't do that. Wait until intermission (or at the very least stand at the back wall where you might have an actual chance to pull off an inconspicuous exit). Expect to not be invited back to this kid's events in the future. Might wanna make that right with the nephew.", "YTA and rude AF. Can you not empathize at all with others?", "Yes, YTA. But now you know better. \n\nIt's incredibly rude to walk out in the middle of a performance, but it's especially so if you're sitting front and center. Even worse when it's a group of young children who have worked very hard and are already nervous - some terrified, as shown by the little performer who broke down in tears. \n\nRegardless of who's performing, rules of etiquette are that you don't enter or leave a live performance except at intermission. The only exception is slipping out as quietly as possible due to an emergency or if your continued presence will be more disruptive than your departure (eg, you're coughing uncontrollably or about to throw up).", "YTA. If you need to leave a performance early, you sit in the back so you can quietly slip out without disturbing others or upsetting the performers. Basic audience etiquette.\n\nEDIT: You mean you could have waited 5 minutes for intermission?? Wow. The burly dad type was so very right and you are lucky he only told you that you needed to learn manners.", "YTA. Please. Common sense should have told you ALL of this.", "YTA because it sounds like you left in the middle of the next skit rather than waiting for it to finish and then making a break for it.\n\nNext child activity you go to, you sit in the back and you wait till intermission to leave. That's polite. What you did was rude, especially to kindergarteners!  Ignorance is no excuse. Google lives in your phone. Use it when you're clueless (or ask sister/brother, whoever's kid it is).", "YTA. At 25 years old, you don't think to look at the program? Wait for a between acts or the intermission. I'm less than a decade older than you. Have some common sense. Btw, intermission would have been great. You could have gone over to your nephew, told him how great he was, and then slipped out. None of my kids have ever been on a school play (we homeschool). The manners and courtesy you use for any play or production applies no matter the age of the performers.", "YTA. Walking out midway is incredibly rude and also demoralising for the kids. Wait til intermission next time.", "YTA. Your timing makes you TA. You should have sat through that skit, then left at the break between that & the next. You disrupted the performance & made yourselves the focus of the room, instead of the kids. I guess common courtesy is a thing of the past.", "YTA - Wait for intermission or at least between vignettes.", "YTA. \n\nYou say you are \"new to this\" but to what exactly? You've never been to a performance of anything...ever? No concert, no professional play, not even a movie? \n\nIf you are going to leave early, you sit or stand in the back. \n\nIf you suddenly have to leave, you at least wait for a break in the acts, if you can't wait for intermission. \n\nYou are old enough to have a girlfriend and I'm assuming to drive, so you can't go through life being like \"this is all so new, common courtesy is too hard!\"\n\nIt doesn't matter what you meant to do, or what you knew or didn't know. Use some common sense and some kindness.", "YTA, plain and simple.", "YTA you were unbelievably thoughtless and rude", "YTA. Yeah, you\u2019re an asshole and this was, indeed, very disrespectful. You wouldn\u2019t do it on Broadway, don\u2019t do it to kids whose families are there. If you\u2019re going to leave at least do it extremely discreetly one by one over the course of 15 minutes, not a mass exeunt.", "Yes, YTAs. It's very rude to leave mid-performance unless it's truly an emergency. The guy who accosted you was right - intermission would be the best time. Most school and professional performances  have programs that let you know what's scheduled. Now you know for next time to grab a program (and sit in the back if you're planning to bail early).", "YTA - Everyone knows the score.  You suffer thru the other brat's act while everyone else suffers thru your brat's act.  It's a CHILDREN'S SHOW, you don't leave in the middle of a CHILDREN'S SHOW.  Wow YTA", "YTA - You could not wait a few minutes? That was really selfish of you guys.  But the guy who followed you out is worse.", "YTA\n\n6 people sitting in the front stood up and left in the middle of some little kids\u2019 performance. You probably made them feel awful.", "YTA. Yup. So rude. Not to mention y'all probably fucked up some parent trying to record their kid's performance.", "YTA. Six people getting up and leaving is super conspicuous. Show some respect to the people performing, even if they're kids.", "YTA.\n\n6 adults leaving all at once, you blocked the people sitting behind you and I assume this is a traditional auditorium. People would have to move their legs to let you through. Do you think kindergarteners don\u2019t see 6 adults leaving? And he\u2019s right, you could\u2019ve waited for Intermission. \n\nAnd why wouldn\u2019t you have stayed towards the end. At the end you could see your nephew all happy with his schoolmates and take pictures of him and his friends. That\u2019s the joy of being a child and you were rude.", "This is what those things are like. It's for the kids not you. Of course they can't act; they're 7. If you can't hack it it's better to stay away. YTA", "Slight YTA:  If you all got up in the middle of the next childs performance.  I'm not saying stay for the whole thing or even till intermission. But at least leave in between #4 & #5", "YTA Just wait 5 minutes? Surely it's not hard and you knew the others all took 10 minutes. The guy who followed you may have been over the top but it was obviously an asshole move if all the other parents were talking about it.", "Yta it was rude to the kids and our was conspicuous since it was a group of you.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You distracted the entire audience and disrupted the performers. Your communication with each other deciding to leave was likely also disruptive. Also, seats up front are not for your  random stranger guests, particularly not those who cannot be politely supportive. Stranger did not need to confront you, but he wasn\u2019t wrong on proper behavior. You were rude to literal children.", "YTA. Don't you think the kids at the end of the play deserve an audience? The parents are right. If you had to leave, at least do it at intermission.\n\nAt any rate, the school did this wrong.

You should have waited til intermission, or til the segment you were watching was over. What you did was insanely rude.", "YTA. You thought it would be good? Then you are delusional. At their age it is expected to be bad but that is what makes it cute. They are TRYING. It\u2019s also interesting that your nephews performance was the only good one.

Instead of acting like seeing the show was a gift to you, you acted like your presence was doing everyone a huge favour.

How would you feel if you were on stage performing and 6 adults got up from clattery benches in the front row and left? It is disruptive and very discouraging to the performers who can see you leave.  Who were kids.  What if your nephew was at the end of the program? Would you appreciate other people leaving, so by the time it got to him, there was no audience left?  Be  more considerate.", "YTA. You left in the *middle* of some kid\u2019s performance?

Leaving in the middle of a kids play would be crushing to the kid that got interrupted. If it was an emergency that\u2019s different but to just say you weren\u2019t feeling it. Don\u2019t be surprised if your nephew refuses to acknowledge you or invite you to any future performances. You also embarrassed him with his friends.", "YTA but the guy who confronted you was totally out of line.\nOn my kids programs they say no one should leave before the full program is over.  That being said, a few still do leave but they stand or sit in the back where it\u2019s not noticed.\nEven if you aren\u2019t aware of the protocol, surely you should have realized that standing up and walking out RIGHT IN FRONT of a 6 year old doing a skit wasn\u2019t cool.  Like at least wait for a break between skits.", "YTA. Just. I can't believe you have to ask. Dumbass.", "You should have sat in the back or stood in the back by the door so you could leave without being noticed.", "YTA?? is this even a question?", "YTA. Not only was it disruptive & rude, but you probably blocked the family filming their kids on the stage. I would have been royally pissed if you blocked my video. Even if you didn't know when intermission was,  you could have left quickly b/w performances. You and your friends are big A-holes.", "YTA. You could have at least waited until intermission.

Welcome to real life kiddos, no one wants to sit through your terrible performance. Honestly, I applaud you for not doing it sooner. \n\nWhen I was at my son's recital last year, as soon as the song was over, like right as it ended, I grabbed him off the stage and we were gone out the door. Some parents were shooting me some upset looks, but I think they were just jealous that I got to leave and they had to stay and listen to the rest of the bad music. His mom wasn't too happy either, but whatever.", "It may not have been fun for you to sit and watch, but think of it like this - \n\nYou are a little kid. 5, 6, or 7 years old.
