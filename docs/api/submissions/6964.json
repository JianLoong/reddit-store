I have two sibling in laws, the middle one is nb, Zee, they/them, 32, and the youngest, my sil, Perry, is f 27. The 9yr age gap between my wife and her baby sister has always been an issue for them. My wife thinks her little sister is a spoiled brat, and Peri thinks Lee is just mean to her. Up until recently, I've always given Perry the same respect I give to my own siblings (b/g twins, 26).\n\nI'm severely asthmatic. Last year, I went on a family trip with my in laws to Austin, TX for my wife's cousin's wedding. The ceremony was beautiful, and the reception was amazing. An open bar with good bourbon certaintly helps. An hr before the reception was to end, I started to get an asthma cough. My throat was scratchy, I was coughing more then usual. I started drinking water, but was beginning to feel like I should get to my inhaler sooner then later. Problem was, my inhaler was back at the airbnb. My wife noticed me having trouble, and asked me if I was ok. I told her I was fine, but, when everyone was ready, I'd like to get back to the airbnb sooner then later to take my meds. She nods and informs her dad. Fil gathers up the family into the rental van, and we start making our way back.\n\nThe whole way back, Perry, who is drunk af now, complains about leaving the party early. I get so annoyed I snap and say \"I'm so sorry my chronic lung disease ruined your night. Next time, I'll make sure to die in peace\". Now I'm wheezing, can barely breathe. It's a full blown asthma attack. I'm literally 2min from telling my fil to skip the airbnb and go straight to the er. Fortunately, we get to the airbnb just in time. I take my meds, and I'm ok. The next morning, P demands I apologize for ruining her night. It's been months and neither of us has apologized for what happened. I've been respectful and amicable towards her, but I guess with my asd I've been showing my distaste more then I thought. My wife tells me this has caused issues in the family because p now thinks I don't like her. I don't hate her, I just think she should be mature enough to admit she made a mistake. Anyways, AMITA for still not apologizing for what happened?\n\nEdit: forgot to mention this, Perry and her partner (m34) were offered the option of an uber.

What does that mean? You need medicine that you don't have with you, you get yourself an uber to get it.\n\nIt depends a bit on what happened when everyone was leaving.
