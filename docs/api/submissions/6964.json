I have two sibling in laws, the middle one is nb, Zee, they/them, 32, and the youngest, my sil, Peri, is f 27. The 9yr age gap between my wife and her baby sister has always been an issue for them. My wife thinks her little sister is a spoiled brat, and Peri thinks Lee is just mean to her. Up until recently, I've always given Peri the same respect I give to my own siblings (b/g twins, 26).\n\nI'm severely asthmatic. Last year, I went on a family trip with my in laws to Austin, TX for my wife's cousin's wedding. The ceremony was beautiful, and the reception was amazing. An open bar with good bourbon certaintly helps. An hr before the reception was to end, I started to get an asthma cough. My throat was scratchy, I was coughing more then usual. I started drinking water, but was beginning to feel like I should get to my inhaler sooner then later. Problem was, my inhaler was back at the airbnb. My wife noticed me having trouble, and asked me if I was ok. I told her I was fine, but, when everyone was ready, I'd like to get back to the airbnb sooner then later to take my meds. She nods and informs her dad. Fil gathers up the family into the rental van, and we start making our way back.\n\nThe whole way back, Peri, who is drunk af now, complains about leaving the party early. I get so annoyed I snap and say \"I'm so sorry my chronic lung disease ruined your night. Next time, I'll make sure to die in peace\". Now I'm wheezing, can barely breathe. It's a full blown asthma attack. I'm literally 2min from telling my fil to skip the airbnb and go straight to the er. Fortunately, we get to the airbnb just in time. I take my meds, and I'm ok. The next morning, P demands I apologize for ruining her night. It's been months and neither of us has apologized for what happened. I've been respectful and amicable towards her, but I guess with my asd I've been showing my distaste more then I thought. My wife tells me this has caused issues in the family because p now thinks I don't like her. I don't hate her, I just think she should be mature enough to admit she made a mistake. Anyways, AMITA for still not apologizing for what happened?\n\nEdit: forgot to mention this, Peri and her partner (m34) were offered the option of an uber.

From your description she made one comment about being upset to leave the party early. Then you absolutely lose it and tell her yell at her some dramatic shit about you possibly dying?? It is also very strange you\u2019re able to talk so much while having an asthma attack- I can\u2019t get any words out. \n\nYou did somewhat ruin everyone\u2019s night by not being responsible with your \u201cchronic lung disease\u201d. On top of that you took one shitty comment super personally and escalated the situation as much as you could. To this day you are still bitter and you hold this against her. \n\nYou criticize her maturity but you are more immature by far. You are 33 years old dude.

Seriously, once in ten years is great. But, I thought this was a fake post at first because you said severe asthma but didnt bring an inhaler to a wedding of all places. My husband has severe asthma and for a long time would take his emergency inhaler several times *a day*. He is so much better now, averaging once a month. We have emergency inhalers everywhere: several in the house, car, jacket pockets, my purses, theyre practically breeding making baby inhalers. \n\nI tell people my husband has respiratory issues and not severe asthma, because so many people think severe asthma is as you describe. Thus, they don't take his issues seriously. So, YTA for that.\n\nBut, NTA for your family's behavior.

It may hurt your pride to admit it, but those two shortsighted decisions resulted in everyone else\u2019s night being cut short. She was a jerk to say it while you were suffering, but she wasn\u2019t wrong.", "The argument could be made that the fact that the solution was for the entire family to pack up and leave the cousin\u2019s wedding instead of you and your wife just taking an Uber back yourselves indicates that your wife might be a little coddled herself. \n\nJust saying.", "You need to see an asthma doctor. If you have a daily cough, your asthma is not controlled. Especially if you are on daily oral steroids. If it\u2019s a steroid inhaler, it needs adjusting.

You need to figure out your health before you end up in the ICU with a tube down your throat or dead in the ground.", "So you have a daily steroid you need to take, have a daily cough, and STILL didn't think having an inhaler was a necessity?\n\nI stand by my earlier statement--this is Darwin Award-level stupidity.", "I\u2019ve also never been able to get out more than a few sputtered words yet OP was able to yell entire sentences at his sister in law.", "YTA. for the comment. Who cares if you carry a lot of shit around.", "If Peri hadn't said anything OP would not have thought he did anything wrong. He ruined everyone's night and others were too decent to complain.

Not long) and you don't want to be waiting on an Uber, and then risking that person cancelling and having to find another, and so on.", "1. Time was of the essence.

Maybe she took time off from work and saved up for this event. Again, forgetting the inhaler was OP\u2019s fault. She should have dealt with it herself.
