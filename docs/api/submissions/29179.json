It's a wedding with friends and family--if the bride wants a  curated wedding where the photos are all perfectly blended and matched, then she should just hire the guests and their costumes.", "I still avoid it for those reasons, especially for daytime weddings. I went to one wedding where all the women were in black, all the men in dark suits, and it looked like a funeral spilling down the church steps after.", "Is a really common if older superstition. It's considered bad luck and a sign that the guest wearing a black dress is treating the wedding like a funeral.", "Why on earth wouldn't one wear red to a wedding, unless it was in a specifically Asian culture where the bride might be wearing it? \n\nAgain, I really wish that people would remember that regional customs are not universal and stop insisting that these things are \"common knowledge\". They aren't.", "In what culture does this \u201crule\u201d apply?", "There is no such thing as \"traditionally\" across cultures and regions. I literally wore black as a bridesmaid and know many others who have. I'd never heard of black being anything other than very appropriate, especially at a formal wedding, as the epitome of classic formal wear, until I got to Reddit and came across Redditors like you insisting that \"traditionally\" one doesn't wear it . . . except that \"traditionally\" in many regions and cultures one absolutely does. And it's absolutely NOT \"commonly known\" anywhere that I've ever been, and I've been to weddings in a variety of different countries, none of which consider it \"rude and bad luck\".\n\nYour \"tradition\" literally only applies to your region and culture and isn't \"commonly known\" at all, in other words. Maybe stop assuming that what is traditional amongst the people you know is the same everywhere.", "It\u2019s common not to wear white due to the bride having a white dress. Black is not the same", "It's moreso becoming outdated, rather than being new.\n\nBlack - you're not celebrating the marriage/in mourning/are sad about the wedding\n\nRed - have slept with the groom/want to draw attention away from the bride", "In the 60s people still held to those traditions, so the girlfriend very likely wore black to express her feelings about the wedding. Not now so much", "I think you meant to say, \"Some people consider it bad luck to wear black to a wedding.\" not \"funeral\". While my family does NOT wear black to funerals (we prefer bright, happy colors), nowhere that I know of is it considered \"bad luck\". I know some Asian cultures wear white for mourning - I would have to ask someone steeped in those cultures about black and bad luck.", "You mean wedding?", "It has become beyond ridiculous.  I don't have any issue with brides going non-traditional, but the conversation keeps ending up something like, \"I reject all the traditions and rules for what I should have/wear/do on my special day!  How dare all my guests not obey the ludicrous rules I imposed for my special day!\"", "Thank you for saying what I was thinking", "Sounds like there wasn\u2019t a dress code and they\u2019re just picking on OP", "Well, we don't actually know if everyone *actually* knew about the dress code-OP could be using hyperbole there. She only mentions the cousins being upset and doesn't bring up any other family members, so we really don't know how many ppl were aware. Heck, there's not even a mention of how OP's parents reacted, which you would think they would either be on the bride's side or OP's depending on what they knew about the dress code. It's actually kind of suspicious to me that OP doesn't mention that.", "How do you know \"everyone\" else? Were you there?", "the context I read said it was NOT on the invitation.", "Literally never heard that before in my life and I'm in my 40's! Every wedding I've ever attended had people wearing black", "Either of two reasons: 1. Red is flashy and you could be seen as trying to take attention away from the bride.  2. Some people take it to mean the wearer has slept with the groom.", "Certainly normal in the UK.  Also red.", "I went to a wedding where the bridesmaids wore black velvet dresses. The mother of the groom wore a black tuxedo coat dress. The mother of the bride wore royal blue suit which stood out like a sore thumb in all the pictures. If she didn\u2019t want to wear black, she should have worn a shade of grey.", "[deleted]", "Agreed. I think the bride and groom should have told the guests not to wear black if they feel this way. The general consensus nowadays seems to be that black is permissible for weddings.", "Yup I meant wedding \ud83d\ude48\n\nNot even cultural but I've heard before it's considered that you don't think it will last or something to that effect", "I did yeah \ud83d\ude48", "[removed]", "Surely varies depending on where you are from? In my country it\u2019s not acceptable to wear (funeral attire-) black, unless stated otherwise on the invitation.", "Even if I'd heard of that superstition, I wouldn't abide by it. I don't pay attention to or adhere to other people's superstitions.", "On my wedding day both my mother and my MIL chose red, so I'm just glad guests didn't seem to have heard about this second meaning \ud83d\ude05", "I wore red 2 of my brothers weddings.......ummmmm", "Yes, and the article also states that you should still avoid it in the South. NAH, but curious: do your cousins live in a culturally and geographically different region from you?", "Yes, West Coast Scottish and wearing black would be something that at least the older generation frowned on. Though more if in wedding party and especially if a mother in law. Seen as casting aspersions on the bridal couple as saying you did not rejoice at the wedding.", "I'm sorry, but you said \"now\" instead of \"not\"", "Go back and read it again.  You missed some things.", "Where I live you would be considered extremely rude if you wore black to a wedding.  \n\nIts not about superstition, its about having some manners.", "When it's their wedding? Do you think it's also ok to show up in jeans? Why not just decline if you're not going to respect the constraints outlined in the activities invitation?", "Oh my lord, could you just imagine the shocked whispering!!!", "And where is that?\n\n\nA man wearing a black or charcoal suit to a wedding is pretty standard operating procedure in North America.", "Because black is a standard color of formal wear. THAT is the widely recognized and understood definition of formal wear.\n\n\nOf course, if someone said \"NO BLACK ATTIRE\" on an invitation I would abide.\n\n\nBut that's not the case here. Are we supposed to familiarize ourselves with every wedding-related batshit-crazy belief that someone might have? \n\n\nBelieving in superstition is juvenile behavior.", "Dresses mainly.  Charcoal suit is fine.  Probably get away with black suit but it isn't the done thing.\n\nUk", "Mb misread what you said. I thought you were saying you would wear black even if they explicitly told you not to. It's true it's juvenile, but hey, we've still got religious people walking around, so I'd prefer some of the milder superstitions.", "Never heard of this in the UK."]}
