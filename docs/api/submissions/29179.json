You aren't wrong in any way,  and yes,  white is the normal wedding color of choice, but when it is not stated, then it doesn't matter.", "Nta.\n\nMy sister got married last Friday and actually encouraged black so it wouldn\u2019t interfere with their colors of choice.", "NTA. Usually, the \"no black\" thing is specifically a rule for the mother of the groom, any ex-partners of the groom, etc. It's really only a rule because some shitty controlling moms and exes will wear black *intentionally* as a sign of \"mourning\" the \"loss\" of their beloved man to some other woman, on a day that's supposed to be about *celebrating* joining two people. It's not really a general rule; generally speaking, black is a formal color that is appropriate for formal occasions. \n\nThe only *general* rules for guests are \"no white/very bridal-looking dresses\" and \"keep to the level of formality specified.\" These rules are pretty consistent for every wedding, so they're good to keep in mind in the future.\n\nThere are some more specific rules for specific classes of guests: if you're closely related to the bride but not a bridesmaid, then you might have the extra rule,\"if you're informed of the wedding colors in advance, avoid wearing the exact same color dress as the bridesmaids so you don't accidentally look like a jilted bridesmaid.\" And if you are close to the groom or if you're a former partner of his, you might have the rule, \"don't wear a bright red dress.\" (This is because wearing a red dress can be used to mean \"I fucked the groom.\") That last one is rather more old-fashioned, though.\n\nEdit: While I described this in heteronormative terms, all of this is sometimes specific to the kind of garment you're wearing, not necessarily to gender. In other cases, it depends on the relationship. For example, black is appropriate for a parent of either spouse of any gender if they're wearing a black suit/tuxedo/etc. It's just a black *dress* that carries mourning connotations. On the other hand, a male ex-partner of one of the newlyweds should also probably not wear a bright red dress-- but he shouldn't wear a bright red suit either!\n\n2nd edit: Keep in mind that the \"white\" general rule is specific to *Western* weddings. In other cultures, you would simply avoid anything \"very bridal.\" For example, you might want to avoid red for a traditional Chinese wedding, and avoid a specifically bridal-looking lehenga/sari/etc. for some Indian weddings (I'm not well-versed enough in Indian formalwear to know what qualifies as particularly bridal-looking, so I would have to ask someone about that one lol). \n\nBasically, all these rules can be summed up thusly: \"Don't try to look like the bride, and don't use your clothing to try to send any kind of *message* to the bride (or groom, or spouse).\"", "NTA. if it wasn\u2019t mentioned on the invite or by anyone in the family, there is no unintentional harm on your behalf. you mentioned that you frequently wear black \u2014 I wouldn\u2019t expect a family member to change their aesthetic for my wedding unless I had explicitly asked for a dress code to be followed. your cousin is also 23 (and you are 20, very close in age) which I think contributes to her reaction.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBlack is fine.", "NTA.

How are you supposed to know about a dress code of any sort if it's not communicated. If the bride wanted specific colors, it should have been on the invite (no black or white attire, please) or somehow communicated in a way that everyone invited would be able to easily see.

Just because you don't believe doesn't mean he doesn't so either wear a different dress or don't come Shannon. \n\n\nMy parents had the same rule but my mom's family is very religious and my dads family is old money snobs.

I have seen people wear something else than black to a funeral which in a lot of cultures would be considered rude as well.
