Whether or not your her legal guardian or biological father, Nora and your family see you as her father figure. \n\nIf your gf does not understand this or respect the wonderful act of taking a child who lost her parent into your life, make her your ex.", "NTA.  Whether or not your daughter is biologically shouldn\u2019t matter on how your gf treats and gets along with her.   And to freak out about it is a huge red flag.  \n\nBut I\u2019m curious why you never discussed the details of how she became your daughter.  Didn\u2019t your gf ever asked where the mother is?  Considering you introduced them to each other, i would think the relationship is far enough along to share some pretty important facts.  Especially after a year.", "NTA. Dump her now. Dyou have no bees for her in your life if she would treat a child that you acknowledge as your kid that way. You could have found Nora in an alley, and if you are raising her as your kid, she is your kid. There are better girlfriends out there. Keep looking. Don't settle for this. You will be happier in the long run.", "NTA. You are basically a God Parent or what ever which kind of does make her your kid if something happens. But her reaction to a child regardless of if it's your biologically or not (could have even been adopted), she shouldn't even be trying to have a relationship with someone who does have kids or want them in the future because she is a walking red flag. Like I get she doesn't like kids but that's not an excuse to talk to them that way or treat them like that. Definitely not an AH but you should definitely be careful about who you date in the future.", "NTA. Even if it was a little weird that you didn\u2019t get into the details at all for an entire year, that should have no bearing on your gf \u201ctolerating\u201d your daughter, good god.", "You didn't lie. You have a child who you are raising, that means you have a child. I can't believe I'm saying NTA to anything with this title but you are definitely NTA and you are better off without the gf.", "Nta and you need to break up with your gf or give Nora back to her legal guardian", "ESH (Except Nora)\n\nYour girlfriend:  She should make more of an effort in the relationship.  The exact legal nature of guardianship has no bearing on the actual reality of the situation in front of her, and she's chosen a technicality as a pretext for her poor behavior.\n\nYou:  You should have brought this up sooner.  On a first date, simply saying you have a daughter rather than getting into the long and drawn out thing might be a decent enough shorthand the conveys the reality of the situation but without detail.  But to be dating her for \\*a year\\* and have not brought this up?  Yeah, that's pretty asshol-ish.", "ESH\n\nI believe you should have just been upfront with with your GF, you could have just said from the get go \"I have a niece called Nora, her Dad passed away 5 years ago and I've been her legal guardian ever since, she is incredibly important to me\"..How hard would that have been? \n\nIs there a specific reason that Nora is not easy to get along with? Obviously if you're not comfortable sharing here, completely fine, but if there is specific reason, you could help your GF by suggesting ways to bond with Nora, obviously if your GF isn't patient it makes it difficult, and your GF is awful for what she said about Nora, so this already seems doomed.\n\nBut as important as Nora is in your life she isn't \"your\"child, she is your brothers child, I think it's important to acknowledge that, as to not try to \"replace\" the father she had, as she was 9 at the time and not a baby, she would know that your Brother is her Dad, and you have now taken on the carer role, but you're not her Dad. \n\nI 100% think you should have been honest from the start, I really can't understand why you didn't? But I don't think it would have mattered with your GF, as she doesn't seem to want to put in effort with your niece, and regardless whether it's your daughter or niece, they way she spoke about your niece is a red flag, and she isn't the one.", "ESH", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Doing things with Nora that Nora enjoys? Has she gone out of her way to show you & Nora that she's serious about you & trying with any effort? I'm guessing no by the way you described how angry she was to find out Nora wasn't biologically yours & that you were \"forcing her to be with her\". \n\nLet this woman go.
