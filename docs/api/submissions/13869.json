But at some point, when you are in a relationship with someone, you are supposed to open up.", "I honestly can't even believe this is a question.\n\n Because he's in an intimate long term relationship with this woman, and you share the details of your life with them. \n\nBecause he's not just been withholding a detail, he's been lying about her mother, about his dead brother, all the stories of her early life - he hasn't been honest about any of it. \n\nHe's been lying about his role in her life- because let's get real, he loves and is committed to her and that's beautiful, but he's not her legal guardian and can't even sign a school permission slip for her. \n\nDoes Nora miss her dead father? How is OP honoring his memory and role in her life? Because apparently he's not doing it in any way that would give a heads up to his girlfriend. \n\nThe question of 'why tell her' comes from a defensive viewpoint of OP and Nora vs the gf. But in any committed and loving and trusting relationship, the aim should be 'the 3 of us'. He created a massive barrier to any long term future with GF. Maybe he'd already figured out her true character, maybe she was more of a F*** buddy that he didn't want a future with. In which case, write it all off as a bad job and move on. But let's not pretend he was reasonable for not telling his long term girlfriend the true nature of his most important relationship.", ">Why should he tell her?\n\nBecause if you are lying about that to your potential life partner the what else are you lying about?\nIt's important information.

In fact she could be charged with kidnaping.\n\nShe is still an asshole, but he also fucked it up. You don't spring this kind of stuff on People.", "Cheers, mate.", "Yep, this is the one. No idea why people are acting like OP needed to info dump trauma about their kid to a new GF. A year is a little long to wait for these shares, but I've noticed that single dads are much more protective of their privacy than single moms are. And someone who is basically the only parent to a younger child doesn't have the time to mess around with endless phone calls and texting so there is a lot less conversation.", "Just chiming in as a single parent who used to date: a lot of times it was \u201cI have a kid\u201d \u201cokay\u201d and then very little follow up on the subject. Of course, this was just casual dating, but most of the people I dated we were more interested in learning about each other first then our dating history if that makes sense? I wouldn\u2019t withhold anything, but I just didn\u2019t feel like my child needed to be a part of our conversations", "I haven't heard the question asked. Did the GF ever even ask? Because that alone would speak volumes about why he hadn't told her. If she never asked, I might wait till she did. Because curiosity shows that someone wants to dig in deeper. But never asking a single question about how he became a single parent. Wouldn't she have wanted to know about his relations with the mother atleast?", "and actually not adopting his daughter because her legal guardian is his other brother \u2026", ">Because you tell you potential life partner about those things.\n\nNot everyone decides someone is going to be their life partner within a year of dating though. Everyone is different. She also said she wouldn't have tried so hard with the kid if she knew that it wasn't his BIO kid. Something tells me he felt an \"off\" vibe and was feeling it out before bringing the gf deeper into their life and the kid's history. He's being protective.

I have a son. He's 16 now, and well I met his mom when he was 2. His mom broke up with me a year ago, he doesn't live with me, but I always introduce him and talk about him as my son. \n\nThe legal grounds don't come up in conversation, IF someone asks questions specifically then that will come up.\n\nWhat makes this a secrete or not would to me be if the girlfriend asked anything direct.

She claimed she was sticking up for her brothers, but she just never learned to butt out. She does have a lot of narcissistic tendencies, however. The problem was that after the nasty things were said, she would never apologize, and she couldn't fathom why nobody wanted to be around her anymore.  Sadly, people like this usually never change.", "People are emboldened to text because it\u2019s not face to face.
