You don't have to be Nora's bio dad to be a good one. IMO and as a dad, NTA.", "NTA, but it looks like it\u2019s time to drop the GF if she has that shitty of an attitude to your daughter (to which is 100% is your child, bio or not)", "NTA. You\u2019re Nora\u2019s dad and the fact your gf thinks she\u2019s not important because she\u2019s not biologically yours is a huge red flag. Sounds like your gf lacks empathy.", "Nta I think I see why Nora and gf don\u2019t get along", "NTA, you are clearly her dad - what does it matter what the biological/official link is if that's how you present yourself and feel? What if you had adopted her or made everything official, would she not be your daughter then either? Ignore the friends, you're a great dad and doing what so many wouldn't and standing up for your child.", "NHA she doesn't respect your family you don't need to tolerate her", "Thank Nora for getting rid of this red flag of a gf of yours. (ETA and her friends group too, although she may have just gaslit them into calling you an AH)\n\nNTA", "NTA \n\nWhile she\u2019s technically your niece, you have taken her in as your child. If some ah can\u2019t handle that, then they don\u2019t deserve you.", "NTA \n\nShe is your daughter. Only because she is not your daughter on paper doesn't mean that you and her can not feel that way. \n\nIf your girlfriend does not accept that well too bad for her but you are as you said a package deal.", "NTA. Being a father is about more than biology. You are her dad and it's your job to protect her, which you are doing. I suggest dropping the girlfriend, she sounds like a crappy person.", "INFO why didn't you share your bio relationship with GF for a year?  How did you keep her from friends and family members who knew?  Sorry but that's not tracking for me.  How did you explain where Nora's bio mom was?", "ESH - Your gf for insulting your kid, but you for lying and also apparently not helping the situation between them. It really matters what you mean by Nora is a difficult child to get along with. Is she badly behaved and rude to your gf or does she just not want a relationship your gf was trying to force?", "NTA. \n\nYou mean your EX-gf, right?", "NTA, lose her number.", "NTA. You\u2019re doing a wonderful thing: raising a bereaved child, with acceptance and love.\nThe world needs more people like you", "NTA ditch the girlfriend she is a piece of trash!!!", "NTA.\n\nNora is yours, she call you dad. Biology do not matter but also in this case you are even biologically related. Honestly, run from this gf as fast as you can. She proved to be tolerating her just because it did appear to not be possible to separate you both. Is this really the adult you want near her?", "NTA. \n\nHowever, for future reference, at some point during the year you were dating it the 4 months Nora an this GF interacted, you could have explained how you came to be Nora's dad. \n\nThis rather awful girlfriend might have tried harder to be understanding of your teenage daughter, knowing what she went through. \n\nIt would have bothered me if a long term boyfriend kept that information from me. It is still a bit of a lie of omission. That doesn't build trust.", "INFO: Have you never mentioned your brother who passed to your GF?", "You're a good dad OP.", "NTA. Kick her out of your life too. You weren\u2019t lying.", "Most 14-yo\u2019s are annoying and hard to get along with. NTA and she\u2019s out of line. Her friends are further out of line. \n\nBut WTF? How did this not come up in a year of dating or even friendship? And, um, if you introduce me to your daughter/niece, I\u2019d want a heads up about major trauma that I need to avoid triggering. \u201cYour dad and I are thinking of getting burgers after the movie\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s my uncle, my dad died 5 years ago\u201d and runs off hysterically sobbing. NOT a good scene.", "I find this very hard to believe. Over the course of a year,  your girlfriend never asked about Nora's mother or anything? How could you not have ever told her the whole story?", "NTA", "NTA, but you def need to improve your relationship skills.\n\nYour\u2014hopefully soon ex\u2014girlfriend just demonstrated why you absolutely need to be honest about things like that the moment you go from casual to \"ok, maybe this has potential for serious relationship\". The strategy of \"if I don't mention X then there's no chance for it to become an issue\" is one of the most common relationship mistakes. The X ALWAYS comes up eventually and then you're months into ill-suited relationship, but cutting your loses becomes more difficult. Learn from this experience.", "The only way you would be an AH in this situation is if you stay with this woman tbh", "NTA. I wanna see what the EX thinks about adoption\u2026because you literally adopted your niece.", "NTA. You\u2019re Nora\u2019s father, biological or not. You did exactly the right thing kicking exgf out, just make sure she stays out. And as for her friends, I wouldn\u2019t lose one wink of sleep worrying about the opinions of the kind of company she would keep.\n\nGood job, Dad.", "NTA and please drop her. I\u2019ve been a child that didn\u2019t get along with their eventual stepmom, because she was a b***h to me and it took years of family therapy to forgive my father for choosing her over me. Don\u2019t do that to Nora, she\u2019s lost enough.", "NTA and I'm curious how your gf didn't ask about where Nora's mother is?  Your gf sounds like a major asshole if she thinks you're an asshole for doing all you can to help a child.  Your gf and her friends seem like a waste of your time", "Best comment! Gf wants any excuse to ditch the child and thinks she's found it. \n\nThere's nothing to salvage here. At VERY BEST, gf will only grudgingly tolerate and resent Nora until such time she feels secure enough to try and banish her again.", "She is definitely acting out because now she finds an excuse to not make an effort. Good job OP. She needs to wake up and immediately drop her delusion that you are dropping Nora for her.", "*all intents and purposes", "Also there\u2019s no way that trauma hasn\u2019t made Nora extremely clingy and overprotective of OP. Like yes, it\u2019s good OP is choosing her over the ex-gf, but that was probably an extremely relevant detail to contextualize why Nora has issues and is struggling and might have helped the gf find more patience with her.", "I wonder if he was predicting there might be issues between gf and Nora so held off telling her to prevent this exact situation. \n\nNTA", "It's totally different scenario 'going up to people' and randomly telling them, and being honest with the person you're in a long term relationship with. At some point over the past year his brothers death must have come up and that was his opportunity to say 'I took in his child and now consider her my own'. None of this excuses his girlfriends reaction, he's still better off out of the relationship. But you share these things with the person you're spending your life with.", "I will never understand how often there are so many people who will txt nasty things to people when it is not their place."]}
