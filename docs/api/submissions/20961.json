We have one child together - Rain (18M), and I've since remarried and have three children from my current wife (she's 48F, the kids are 8M, 15M and 19F). the customary arrangement we've had since Rain's been a teenager is that he spends 3months at his mother's house and then 3 months at my house and back again. Rain recently turned eighteen during the three-month period that he stays with me, and since then he's had to pay rent and for his own food for the rest of the time he stays here.\n\nHe wasn't necessarily expecting it but he wasn't a brat about it. He picked up a job quickly and has paid his first month of rent. No issue there. He's also putting aside money into his college fund so he can attend university next year. No issue there, either. But apparently he's not budgeting properly because he's always hungry. He eats all right, but he wastes his money on junk food instead of buying substantial meals. As a result, he goes through periods where he gets borborygmi. It's nothing too loud but it is noticeable if the room is relatively quiet. Last time I had my sister over she noticed and he said he just had a stomachache. \n\nWe're expecting company again this week and I don't want something like that happening again, so I explained to Rain that he can introduce himself to our guests and then he needs to stay in his room until they leave.\n\nRain got pissed and argued he didn't know how long the guests would be staying, and that he can't help that he's \"starving\" out here. I reminded him he is not starving but even if he was it's not my fault; he agreed to the rules when he got here. Rain said he isn't blaming me for it, but he's not following my \"dumb rules\" regarding the guests, even after I told him they'll only be here for about an hour.\n\nI'm worried that because he's mad now, he's going to act all dramatic about how he doesn't get enough food in front of our guests, and even though it's none of my fault if that somehow gets to my ex-wife I don't know what she'll say and I don't feel like dealing with drama. I also feel like he was trying to emotionally manipulate me with the \"starving\" comment.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1688104458, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14mru11/aita_for_telling_my_son_he_has_to_stay_in_his/", "score": 472, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If your son is malnourished because you're not fucking feeding him that's entirely you're fault and you're a shitty parent for making him feel like he has to ration his food so he can save for college and pay you rent.

If u have these expectations of your son at least have the decency to teach him what he needs to know. I was always taught that there are no step/half siblings, we are all one family.

We have one child together - Rain (18M), and I've since remarried and have three children from my current wife (she's 48F, the kids are 8M, 15M and 19F). the customary arrangement we've had since Rain's been a teenager is that he spends 3months at his mother's house and then 3 months at my house and back again. Rain recently turned eighteen during the three-month period that he stays with me, and since then he's had to pay rent and for his own food for the rest of the time he stays here.\n\nHe wasn't necessarily expecting it but he wasn't a brat about it. He picked up a job quickly and has paid his first month of rent. No issue there. He's also putting aside money into his college fund so he can attend university next year. No issue there, either. But apparently he's not budgeting properly because he's always hungry. He eats all right, but he wastes his money on junk food instead of buying substantial meals. As a result, he goes through periods where he gets borborygmi. It's nothing too loud but it is noticeable if the room is relatively quiet. Last time I had my sister over she noticed and he said he just had a stomachache. \n\nWe're expecting company again this week and I don't want something like that happening again, so I explained to Rain that he can introduce himself to our guests and then he needs to stay in his room until they leave.\n\nRain got pissed and argued he didn't know how long the guests would be staying, and that he can't help that he's \"starving\" out here. I reminded him he is not starving but even if he was it's not my fault; he agreed to the rules when he got here. Rain said he isn't blaming me for it, but he's not following my \"dumb rules\" regarding the guests, even after I told him they'll only be here for about an hour.\n\nI'm worried that because he's mad now, he's going to act all dramatic about how he doesn't get enough food in front of our guests, and even though it's none of my fault if that somehow gets to my ex-wife I don't know what she'll say and I don't feel like dealing with drama. I also feel like he was trying to emotionally manipulate me with the \"starving\" comment.\n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Wanting to *eat regularly*, and all. The nerve. I\u2019m 46 and my mom still makes me a grilled cheese when I go to my parents house.

She planned to pocket everything - again.\n\nPeople are crappy. Parents and step parents are crappy.\n\nIf he is 18 and not still in high school, I suggest he use his new income to find an apartment.\n\nIf he is still in High School maybe he should just ask his mother if he can not visit the other family.\n\nLet karma kick his Father in the pants.\n\n*I had already spoken to my Father about buying the house and he declined.", "He doesn't want ex-wife to know because she would probably rip him a new arsehole.

He truly is something else. This is why he wants him in his room when they have guests over.

Fair enough him paying a token board but for him to pay rent and everything himself when 19f is is a disgrace", "When I visit my mum it's like a mini shopping trip the way I pilfer things from her pantry.", "Same! I've learned to bring a bag to my folks' house whenever I go because they always have something to give me.", "The post was bad but your comments are just on another level altogether. It sounds like he is being excluded from the family on a daily basis. And the different standards for him and your stepdaughter is just top shit parenting from you and your wife. \n\nI hope your son finds himself away from this \u201dhome\u201d as soon as he can. Also funny how the most concerning thing to you is him making you look bad in front of others, not you mean and unfair treatment of your kid. This has nothing to do with teaching him responsibility.", "Hmm what does it seem like? \n\nLike you're enfocring rules on kid but not another, and no the fact that you feel like you aren't allowed to enforce them on your step daughter isn't an excuse. If anything you should've then told your son, same rules apply. The fact that you didn't just shows how little you care for equality. \n\nDoes it seems like you aren't feeding the child you decided to have? Because you're money hungry and instead of trying to help you child save money so he came start his life you're starving him. \n\nDoes it seem like your essentially trying to recreate the iconic scene in the second Harry Potter movie (that as not been adopted by introverts) where an neglected child is being forced to \"be in his  bedroom, making no noise and pretending he is not there.\"\n\nDoes it seem like you're going for the Vernon Dursley Award? \n\nYes, OP, it does seem like all of the above and it does seem as bad as it seems from the outside. In fact it seems even worse and every comment you make just makes it worse. You might think you comments are justifying you but all you're doing is cementing what the majority have said. \n\nOut of curiosity, why do you think you're not the asshole? What is your justification for even asking this question?", "YTA- I especially love how you sprung this on him for a milestone birthday.  Very classy.  And since you couldn\u2019t be bothered to give him a heads up that this would be a rule, prepare him by teaching him budgeting and how to cook, etc and now you blame him for not knowing these things, you now think it\u2019s appropriate to hide him from sight because he might reveal to others that you suck as a parent.  That not only are you not including him as part of the family dinners (or even holding a plate over for him, you know he is going without food because of your lack of parenting and planning and poor communication and punitive and double standards.  I\u2019m curious how life was for you at 18- where you thrown in to the deep end with no warning or education or guidance?  Do you think that was actually beneficial if you were?", "You mentioned that the 19 year old is your wife\u2019s daughter so the rules don\u2019t apply. Is the house a sole  property of your wife, is your wife the main breadwinner ? Because if she is , then yeah maybe she could be lenient with her own daughter though cruel to your son . But if it\u2019s both your home, utilities and food bills come from a joint account, both kids need to be treated the same. Though you make no mention of your wife and she might not be that type at all, but I personally think you\u2019re whipped and the only way to show that you\u2019re a man is by whipping your own son.

They will also have their collage fully paid for by you.", "Wow\u2026 you are a cold hearted soul. I hope your son realizes the custody agreements no longer holds and he either goes back to his mom or finds his own place. \n\nWhile I am all about charging rent when someone turns 18 I also believe you shouldn\u2019t keep that rent but instead save it for the child to have when they move out to help with the transition. \n\nBut to withhold food from someone is messed up. My parents would have never done that to any of us. Of course my parents also cared for us.", "It is exactly as bad as it seems.

You actually let your son go hungry?! When you decided on this archaic rule did you do any sort of budget management talks with your son or teach him how to prepare healthy meals??", "You're a fucking dogshite parent. Just because someone is legally an adult at 18 doesn't mean they're ready for all life has to throw at them and they no longer need parental support. \n\nFuck I'm glad I've got a Dad that actually gave a shit about teaching me how to be an adult as well as supporting me up to my early 20s. Hopefully your son does well in life despite the shit start his arsehole father has gave him.\n\nOh and if it's not clear YTA and a shite parent to boot.", "You are a monster.", "Jesus fucking christ!

You remarrying is not his fault. Why do you hat him so much?\n\nYou are the most abusive parent I have read of on Reddit. You are actually starving your son, and claim it's because he's an adult? You think him distracting himself in front of the TV is \"not as bad\"? I can't imagine an almost-child having to decide between his rent or his food at his own father's house. \n\nI have heard of these strange customs, mostly in American homes, that a child turning 18 is the trigger for just kicking him out, charging him for rent, etc. Very odd in itself.  You are the first I hear who charges  him for rent and also expects him to pay for his food too. I guess the rent he pays is good for you, but you have conditioned him to think it's natural to be hungry all the time.\n\nPoor boy, not only suffering, but also asked to put up a smiling face for his father's comfort.", "No, it really is as bad as it seems from the outside. Essentially, your child has turned 18, and you have stopped parenting. My adult child has adult responsibilities. When she is home from Uni she cooks sometimes,  cleans skeins,  runs errands sometimes.... you get the idea. She may even buy some food if she feels like cooking something we don't have or might buy a treat for her sisters.  However, unless she has finished studying and has a full time job,  she will never have to pay for her food and board.", "You are starving your own child !! \nYou are not just an asshole ,you are a monster. \nSHAME ON YOU !!", "I feel so sad for your son.
