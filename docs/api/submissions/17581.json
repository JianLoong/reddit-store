With It's been a life-changing journey for me. The journey started when my doctors warned me about my poor cardiovascular health because of my unhealthy eating habits and lifestyle. With 30 right around the corner I couldn't keep being the man I was before. It was a significant wake-up call. I tried immediately just focusing on going hard in the gym, but I tried lifting weights without eating properly and pretty much fried my CNS during deadlifts, causing me to pass out at the gym. It scared the hell out of me.\n\nSince then, I've taken my health incredibly seriously. I prep all my meals and they are calculated to meet my nutritional needs for the day and keep a caloric deficit to have me on track for losing weight. I've avoided eating out at all costs, as it feels like a slippery slope back to my old habits. For me, restaurants are like relapsing on a drug. One bite of a cheesesteak eggroll and I'm buying oreos on the way home and falling off the wagon.\n\nMy girlfriend has been supportive of my health journey but hasn't joined me. She still cooks and eats as she did before, which is a lot of food covered in fats and sugars with a lot of calories. I'm appreciative of her cooking but I can't eat the meals she makes most of the time. It's been a bit of a strain on our relationship, but we've managed.\n\nSo, boom. The conflict arose on our anniversary last month. She wanted to go out to a fancy restaurant to celebrate. And, I wanted to make the night special as well, and I agreed to go. I even made sure I had calories leftover to have drinks with dinner. However, I didn't want to break my diet and decided to bring a prepped meal to eat in the car before we went in.\n\nShe discovered what I was doing and got really upset. She called me an asshole for not putting aside my diet for one night, saying I cared more about my food intake than about our special day. She said that I was being selfish and that I should have been more considerate of her feelings since it's our anniversary.\n\nI feel conflicted. On one hand, I understand where she's coming from, and I didn't mean to upset her. On the other hand, I've worked really hard to improve my health and I'm scared of falling back into old habits.\n\nAITA for sticking to my diet even on our anniversary?\n\nEdit: I'm 5'4\" and 297 pounds currently.", "created_utc": 1684434438, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13l6rz4/aita_for_eating_a_prepped_meal_in_my_car_before/", "score": 154, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You have an extremely unhealthy relationship with food. You think your diet is helping you, but it sounds more like you have an eating disorder. One nice meal in YEARS of taking care of yourself will not disrupt your diet. If it would, then you are very unhealthy mentally. \n\nDo you go to a therapist or dietician?", "Sorry but YTA. \n\n>I've avoided eating out at all costs, as it feels like a slippery slope back to my old habits. For me, restaurants are like relapsing on a drug. One bite of a cheesesteak eggroll and I'm buying oreos on the way home and falling off the wagon. \n\nThis is your responsibility to address man. You have an extremely unhealthy relationship with food you need to work on, probably with a professional. I get this started for the right reasons, but you have wildly overcorrected and it seems like you are pretty firmly in ED territory. \n\nYour SO has been supportive and literally wanted ONE dinner out with you for your anniversary. You shouldn't be in a relationship if you can't do this for her, it is bare minimum stuff. Your mental health is important, take care of it. I hope you do because what you are describing is not sustainable or normal and it won't end well.", "You saved calories for drinks? Like that's on your strict diet plan? There had to be something on the menu you could have had. Grilled chicken with veggies? Tossed salad with dressing on the side.", "YTA. If you can't even deal with one restaurant meal at this point, then you should have suggested some alternate celebration. \n\nAnd frankly, even dieters can figure out what to order that is healthier or within caloric guidelines for a single day. Your  rigidity around your eating plan borders on obsession.", "You might as well not have gone to the restaurant at all if you were just going to eat in the car before hand.\n\nOne meal out in a year isn\u2019t going to set you back \n\nYTA", "YTA to your partner and veering into very unhealthy territory for yourself. \n\nThere\u2019s no way you couldn\u2019t have picked a restaurant you could have had a healthy meal at. I\u2019ve been there. I lost 60 pounds through gym and nutrition. And I ate out with loved ones and tackled my emotional issues around food. Clearly you\u2019ve yet to try that and you really should. Zero reason why you couldn\u2019t get a steak, baked potato and a side salad and fit that into your macros.", "YTA - you need to learn to manage your eating in a real world way. Taking your GF out for your anniversary and then sitting there not eating is just plain rude and completely ruined the  experience for her.\n\nEating your prepped foods on a daily basis is great and awesome. It puts in you in control and that's a great thing. However, if you can't manage your eating in social situations you're going to have issues. Not just with your GF and friends but potentially co-workers and family.\n\nA very important skill you need to learn in your weight loss/health journey is how to navigate social situations. Look at the menu online along with the nutritional data before you go, then pick what you can eat from that. If there's nothing on that menu then politely try to change the location to a place you can eat. When your meal comes divide it in half and only eat that half, take the rest home to enjoy later or let your gf have your leftovers. \n\nI applaud you on the success you've had but if you want to make this a lifetime success you need to learn how to stick to your plan in social settings.", "I hear you, but YTA. I\u2019ve lost 60lbs myself this year and plan on more, so I do  understand your dedication and the strict calorie counting. HOWEVER, special days are special for a reason. Let\u2019s say the entire meal with drink came to around 3,500. You and I both know that is the equivalent of 1lb. Those calories might set you back and take two to get back on track, but it\u2019s worth it to avoid this. Sorry, but YTA here.", "YTA\n\nYou clearly knew you wouldn't be putting your diet to one side for this special occasion and yet you still went.   You could have sat down with your girlfriend beforehand to plan a special night that took your situation into account of course, but then she's been supporting you on this journey throughout and you couldn't return the favour for just *one* night ?\n\nAnd to eat your meal in the car before you went in ?.\n\nThat's almost like saying \"Oh by the way honey, fuck your special night\"", "YTA, it was one night and I\u2019m sure you could\u2019ve found something semi healthy to eat there. Or made up for it the next day, something. I would\u2019ve been upset as well, I don\u2019t blame her. I can\u2019t imagine sitting there at a restaurant having a meal while my partner sits there not eating. Talk about uncomfortable", "YTA, you knew you were going out to celebrate you took measures to make sure you could drink, but not so you could eat the meal with your partner.\n\nI understand the diet and your health is important but you've just replaced an unhealthy relationship with food with a different unhealthy relationship with food. Its very easy to go down a different slippery slope when it comes to food and health. You need to look deeper into your issues with food and address the core problem if you are going to start having a healthy outlook to your eating.", "YTA - How awkward is it to be at a restaurant with another person and be the only one eating? AND she had to sit in the car and watch you eat before you guys went in as a SURPRISE? Did you just blind-side her with your sack lunch parking lot picnic once you got there? Ewwww, dude.", "I think you might need a therapist my dude.", "Nta. But you do need help. I struggle with weight and disordered eating, so i understand how going out to eat one time is a slippery slope and can end up to a month long binge, causing a 20 lb weight gain. I still dont have it figured out, but therapy and nutrition classes might help.", "Wwwwhhhaaattt??  I am not making the connection between you eating a prepped meal and her saying you are selfish and .... inconsiderate of her feelings??  What about your feelings?\n\nYou were both going into the restaurant, right? You were going to order something to eat, have some drinks, etc. Right? So why is she blowing up at you for eating a prepped meal?\n\nDude, I'm sorry to read this happened to you. Her response was OTT and what she said was out of line. If she can't get on board with your weight journey then you two are not compatible.\n\nPlease do not feel bad about this. You are NOT TAH for sticking to your diet. Good on you and a virtual pat on the back to you for your journey.", "NTA\n\nAnyone saying otherwise doesn\u2019t have a clue about how complicated the process of changing body comp is for humans, let alone how incredibly difficult it is to change relationship to food and eating. After two years should you be able to take a night off and eat in a restaurant? Literally only you and your health care providers could answer that question. Even your loved ones probably don\u2019t have a clue how complex this kind of life change is.\n\nThe only aspect left is whether you were an AH in this situations with your fianc\u00e9e. The main alteration that I think you have responsibility for and failed in is communication. You should have talked to her ahead of time so that both of you could have your hopes and expectations met. That\u2019s an error, in my opinion not worthh of AH status. I wouldn\u2019t even say your partner is the AH, except that her expression of disappointment seems accusatory and hurtful. But ultimately I think she deserves a pass, in favor of more communication.\n\nListen, on another note, I do need to be working with a profession to stay on top of your mental health and behavior. I\u2019ve got a strong suspicion that part of why you didn\u2019t talk to her before hand about your personal dinner plans is because you feel ashamed - that\u2019s not a good recipe for your health in the long term, and could be more detrimental to your success than anything else.", "YTA- I\u2019m sorry dude, I\u2019m not usually this type of person. It\u2019s fine to start a diet. It just feels like you are taking it a bit too far. If you are scared of overeating after ONE night out of 1,000+ other nights, maybe you should address that with a professional. Putting that aside, though, I don\u2019t see how your SO\u2019s eating habits were relevant. The way you phrased it didn\u2019t sit well with me. You could\u2019ve stopped at \u201cshe is supportive\u201d you didn\u2019t have to mention she didn\u2019t join in on a diet. You didn\u2019t have to mention her cooking was \u201ccovered in a lot of fats and sugars with a lot of calories\u201d idk man. That felt almost like shaming her in a way?", "Soft YTA. Just because you're eating out doesn't mean you have to order calorie-laden food. Many restaurants have salads available as entrees, or you can get a steak or grilled chicken with vegetables for your side side. If you can't eat out because you're too tempted to order something high in calories, and that would lead to further binging, I agree with others that you need to see a professional for help on dealing with food.", "Yta\n\nAll the work you put into your diet, and you couldn't look up a menu online and planned an order that would fit your diet? \n\nInstead, what your did shows that you don't actually see yourself *with* your partner, because you refuse to do anything actually *with* her. \n\nThat and you very clearly judge your partner. You two shouldn't be together.", "I\u2019m going against the grain and saying NTA because I can sympathize. \n\nI have NAFLD and have had to give up A LOT of foods. I am not in a position where I can make sacrifices as I\u2019m at a level of scarring that can still be repaired, but also know that if I don\u2019t take it seriously I can progress to the next level\u2014cirrhosis. \n\nFor multiple reasons, I also have a poor relationship with food (that\u2019s a whole other conversation), plus I have food allergies. It\u2019s exhausting having to keep all of these things in check and not obsessing over it. In truth, I\u2019m probably on my way to an eating disorder if I\u2019m not there already. While those are my issues to deal with, it doesn\u2019t help that I can\u2019t get the support I need from a licensed nutritionist because my insurance won\u2019t pay for it. My insurance company would rather pay for my meds, tests, and appointments over paying for a dietitian to help me get my liver disease in check. What the actual fuck? Ironically, they would pay if I was diagnosed with an eating disorder \ud83d\ude44\n\nIt\u2019s not as simple as following a fad diet and losing weight quickly because that can progress my disease as well. So, I\u2019m basically left to do my own research and do my best to keep my eating on target because that\u2019s what my liver needs. If I eat crap food, I\u2019m in pain 10-15 minutes later. And this is why I sympathize with you and the position you\u2019re in because it\u2019s for your health and you only have one body. \n\nHowever, you should have talked to your gf ahead of time and told her that you planned to eat beforehand, and then found something light and small to order at the restaurant. Grilled chicken and some veggies are almost always on a menu, so you could have made a little more effort. You have to find ways to adapt, and so do I. Avoidance isn\u2019t sustainable without addressing the root issue.", "NTA.\n\nFood can absolutely be an addiction, and it's clear that you have an addictive relationship with it.\n\nThis is literally your life and longterm health on the line-- if you don't think that you can take a cheat day without setting yourself back, then don't. \n\nIf your girlfriend can't understand and support that, then get a new one. You can replace her, but you can't replace your health.\n\nETA: Unfortunately you're getting a *lot* of ignorance in this thread. I don't think most people understand that being obese and being morbidly obese are wildly different conditions, so they think that because they went from 190 to 150 pounds with cheat days, it should be the same for you. No one gets to a BMI of almost 65 without having a very, very severe problem with food, and that can't be compared to whatever problems someone with a BMI of 30 has.", "Yta.  Pick a place you can eat at.  It was rude of you to pre eat.  I'm currently in calorie deficit too, at the very low number of 1200 calories a day.  I can still eat out with my family.  It just takes some pre planning and careful selection.  \n\nYou should also look for ways to incorporate your meals with your girlfriend's.  Coming two meals forever is going to get old and there's plenty of meals that work for both diets with some minor modifications.", "YTA you\u2019ve swapped one eating disorder for another.", "One meal isn't going to make that much of a difference if you plan ahead for it.\n\nIf you can't ever deviate from this diet, you're in as bad of a place as you were before you started.\n\nYTA", "Soft YTA. It sounds like you\u2019ve worked hard to change your lifestyle, but you yourself said this has strained your relationship. Your GF probably wanted ONE night where dinner wasn\u2019t all about calories and fats and sugars. It was about sharing a nice \u201ctreat\u201d meal to celebrate your relationship. If you can\u2019t eat out EVER without getting out of control, then you still have a problem.", "YTA. Being in a relationship with someone who swaps one addiction for another will get tired fast for a noncodependent partner. I would see a physician who specializes in bariatric nutrition and one qualified to help with whatever choices will help on a path of recovery for establishing and maintaining a healthy lifestyle.\n\nI applaud you for the courage to change and no longer ignore your own health. What needs changing immediately is that the approach to health thru your routine is too rigid, and thus fragile given a solo meal will set you back so easily. Getting healthy should be a long game and flexible with eating options in any environment. She had one birthday and deserved to have the focus be about celebrating her; being not disappointed was a reasonable request for a special occasion. That shouldn't happen again. I'd start by apologizing. Good luck, I've been her with a professional athlete with a strict diet lifestyle. My happiness was no less important either.", "YTA - communication.  It's great that you're sticking to your guns on your health.  And even better that you're being supported.  An anniversary meal is an important event.  If you were not going to partake in the meal, you needed to have COMMUNICATED that to your GF.\n\nThe picture this posts paints is that you were going to eat your prepared meal in the car and then sit there and watch your GF eat in the restaurant while you just sat there and had a drink.  That's a bit embarrassing for your GF, wouldn't you agree?", "NTA\n\nA lot of people are good with moderation, some people aren\u2019t. I\u2019m guessing that psychologically you are an all or none person.\n\nFor all those people saying that one meal is not going to ruin a diet, I disagree. It could psychologically derail somebody, and make it impossible to continue with their diet plan.\n\nThere\u2019s a huge psychological component of being able to commit to losing weight. You absolutely should ask your girlfriend to celebrate your anniversary in another way this year. Celebrating with food is not the only way to go, especially when you are in the middle of your diet journey.", "> I'm 5'4\" and 297 pounds currently\n\nYa, keep dieting.\n\nNta", "NAH for some people eating unhealthy is an addiction so I fully support you not wanting to relapse, but also understand your girlfriend being upset.", "What I don't really get, is why you guys didn't pick a restaurant where you could get a healthy meal? I get you don't want to risk anything, but there are plenty of restaurants where you can eat without having to worry about the calories", "Op don\u2019t listen people here. You are doing what is the best for your health. And you and doing an excellent job. I know how hard is to developing discipline around food and you don\u2019t want to take risks. Good for you. NTA.", "YTA \n\nTake if from someone who once was just like you described. You may think you are doing this for your health, but what you are doing is extremely unhealthy and will likely cause much more long term harm than the cardiovascular concerns your doctor had.\n\nThe fact you are unable to take a break for a single meal or find something nourishing on the menu shows you are going about things the wrong way and and focusing on restriction rather than reframing your relationship with food to make healthy choices. \n\nRestricted eating and exercise like this can cause lasting damage to every organ in your body. I\u2019ve known people who ended up with severe gastrointestinal problems, requiring surgeries multiple surgeries to fix internal organs, developing severe bone and nerve disorders, and other issues due to complications of restricted eating and overexercising. I myself have never fully recovered from my years of restriction and overexercising and the damage it did to my body. \n\n\nYou may not be ready to hear this, but what you have just described is an eating disorder. You need to work with an eating disorder specialist to reframe your relationship with food. You need to learn how to make good choices to nourish your body without restricting yourself. It is possible to be healthy without framing everything from a restrictive point of view. You can learn to make good choices for nourishing your body that still gives you the flexibility to eat in a restaurant or have a treat without slipping down the slope, but you need professional help and a lot of hard work and time to learn how to repair your relationship with food this way. If you really are doing all this for your health, then please seek professional help for this to make sure you learn to do it correctly and safely.", "So you are in the wrong but it\u2019s hard to call you TA when it\u2019s so clear that you need to see an eating disorder therapist", "YTA. You are not thinking about your GF or your relationship at all. For a year, you really did not have any date nights outside? At a restaurant? As a treat? Like really?\n\nFor the anniversary, you should just suck it up and go to the restaurant and eat a meal. Sometimes, you should eat the food your GF cooks. You can\u2019t expect her to make all accommodations.\n\nAlso, eating outside one time does not mean you should be binging on Oreos next. I have been thin and I have been fat, it was never oh God I ate a McD, now I have to eat Oreos. You can control your eating without putting strain on your relationship.", "This is an eating disorder. It's great you're losing weight and focused on your health. But your life cannot be controlled by a calorie forever, and if one bite sends you relapsing, you have not actually addressed the big problem at all. You should be able to eat a single meal without pulling your hair out or \"budgeting\" for it. NAH.\n\nIf it's an option where you live or through your work, please consider addiction counseling. Food addiction is very real, and arguably harder than most others since food is the cornerstone of life.", "Slight YTA. I feel you have turned whatever your behaviors around food pre diet into a new obsession which is calorie counting. Taking care of your health is extremely important and your weight loss is commendable, however if you have reached a point where you cannot incorporate anything into your diet that isn\u2019t precisely timed and managed, you have created a new addiction that is just as concerning. One night at a restaurant should not cause any unmanageable course correction and the idea that it might tells me that you haven\u2019t truly dealt with the issue of food, you have simply found a workaround to not have to deal with it. Your girlfriend is expressing that your habitual and precise calorie counting is taking precedence over her at every moment even when it\u2019s a moment that should be shared with her. You can certainly choose to continue this but I think it\u2019s fair that your girlfriend accept that your fear of weight gain from one meal is more of a priority than one meal with her", "very soft YTA \n\nThis very strict diet is helping but if you feel like even ONE meal outside of it will break you completely then I don't think you're approaching this in a healthy way. You need to speak to a nutritionist who can help you. I don't want you to develop disordered eating and I think you're  approaching that path.", "NTA. These responses make me feel you can't win. You know your body and your reactions best. If you know eating restaurant food will kickstart a process that ends in oreos and binges, then you did the right thing. People saying you shouldn't have gone to the restaurants then...your girlfriend wanted to go there, and I have a feeling if you had said no, let's do something else, she'd be upset. Everything ends with her upset, and all these people being upset with you too is super unfair. Seriously, NTA.", "In the end you should do what's best for you if you really feel like that would be a slippery slope, but have you considered that you may be going to an extreme? Have you considered that you may need to take a look at your mental health for being incapable of going one day without breaking your diet? Relating a diet to addicts falling off the wagon seems a tad unhealthy to me but I'm by no means a SME on human psychology.\n\nI'd say veery slight YTA because you should have discussed it with her before hand but I really can see where you're both coming from.\n\nGood luck", "NTA. The way you talk about food is like a drug addict. Just like addicts cannot take that one hit, one drink, etc. You cannot take the one \"bad/cheat\" meal without falling back into your bad habits.\n\nYou are doing something for your health. Your homemade meals are part of a regimen to keep you off your \"drug\" - hence high calorie foods. \n\nDid your girl want your present for the anniversary dinner or did she want to hinder your health and progress on your anniversary? I would rethink this relationship if you guys are not compatible regarding health issues.", "YTA. \n\nThere is ZERO chance you couldn't have ordered a meal with her and not ruined your recovery or her experience. You know how I know this, because I have ulcerative colitis and about 3 other gastrointestinal diseases I literally can't eat most food without risking an emergency room visit but my partners and I still regularly find restaurants I can enjoy with them even if it means asking for a plain chicken breast/source of protein. \n\nI hope this is the last anniversary she has to feel less than a priority.", "NTA. People can eat what they want. It\u2019s not like he refused to go - why does HE need to eat in order for her to enjoy it?", "NTA. Keep up the good eating. But she sounds like she would take an alcoholic to a bar and tell him 'One drink won't hurt'. She doesn't sound like she's the one for you. She's too worried about what she wants and expects you to give up your health for her. Maybe this is a wake-up call for you.", "Congratulations! You are doing an amazing job in your weight loss.  I'm rooting for you OP.\n\nGiven your height and weight, you know you are not out of the woods.  You are taking your health very seriously AS WELL YOU SHOULD.  You did not do anything wrong.  Let her know that she can have you healthy and alive, or she can have you morbidly obese and careening towards death.\n\nIf you eating the anniversary meal at a restaurant is more important to her than your health, she doesn't really care about you.\n\nNTA. You can sit at a restaurant, eat a small item, and have a wonderful conversation.  My best friend is on the same journey as you and recently got out of a 5 day hospital stay at 35 years of age.  He is lucky to be alive.  He is down to 280 (started at 340), and trust me when I got out to a dinner with him, I don't care what he eats....I'm just supportive and thankful to God that I still have him around.  And we walk together in the morning and evenings for 4 miles.  It is the least that I can do for someone I love and don't want to lose.\n\nDoes your girlfriend love you like this and not want to lose you?  Does she put in effort to help you stay on track or motivate you?  Because people who see you in a terrible medical shape and do nothing....don't really love you more than they love themselves and their own wants/needs.\n\nFor all those [Y.T.As](https://Y.T.As) out there, if OP was an alcoholic but his girlfriend wanted him to have some alcoholic beverages with dinner and was angry if he did not, this is the same identical situation.  Or illegal drugs/controlled substances.  Respect people's healthy decisions.", "NTA. I get it.", "You probably could have communicated better and avoided the last minute drama but if you had quit smoking or drinking no one would tell you that you should have one ciggy or one drink.  Work on the communication but kudos to you for turning your life around.", "NTA - There may be better ways to handle this, but your tendency to fall off the wagon for small indulgences is a pretty good explanation for why you need to do this.  In the future, maybe you call the restaurant ahead of time and either have them serve you your pre-prepared dinner or make something special that works for your diet.\n\nGood luck with your health.  Your gf needs to consider how she would feel if you dropped dead from a heart attack at 30.  She probably won't care about the restaurant meal you missed at that point.", "Sounds like I'm in the minority, but I'm going with NTA.  You didn't tell her she couldn't eat dinner and you still went out with her for your anniversary and for drinks.  By being with you, she should understand how important this diet is to you and be supportive.", "I'm just so happy for your GF that she found out what an asshole you are before considering marrying you.   Prepare to be single soon and good luck finding someone who will put up with your bullshit.\n\nYTA", "YTA\n\nLet's not sit here and compare addictive, dangerous drugs to bad eating habits. \n\nYou need to see a professional because such restricted habits are specifically what's going to cause a 'relapse'. No dietician or nutritional specialist would ever recommend this type of eating. It's okay to indulge once in a while. It shouldnt cause you to spiral back into poor eating habits. By making things so restricted you are setting yourself up for either failure or a miserable life. This diet is not sustainable", "NAH... I understand why she was upset.

With It's been a life-changing journey for me. The journey started when my doctors warned me about my poor cardiovascular health because of my unhealthy eating habits and lifestyle. With 30 right around the corner I couldn't keep being the man I was before. It was a significant wake-up call. I tried immediately just focusing on going hard in the gym, but I tried lifting weights without eating properly and pretty much fried my CNS during deadlifts, causing me to pass out at the gym. It scared the hell out of me.\n\nSince then, I've taken my health incredibly seriously. I prep all my meals and they are calculated to meet my nutritional needs for the day and keep a caloric deficit to have me on track for losing weight. I've avoided eating out at all costs, as it feels like a slippery slope back to my old habits. For me, restaurants are like relapsing on a drug. One bite of a cheesesteak eggroll and I'm buying oreos on the way home and falling off the wagon.\n\nMy girlfriend has been supportive of my health journey but hasn't joined me. She still cooks and eats as she did before, which is a lot of food covered in fats and sugars with a lot of calories. I'm appreciative of her cooking but I can't eat the meals she makes most of the time. It's been a bit of a strain on our relationship, but we've managed.\n\nSo, boom. The conflict arose on our anniversary last month. She wanted to go out to a fancy restaurant to celebrate. And, I wanted to make the night special as well, and I agreed to go. I even made sure I had calories leftover to have drinks with dinner. However, I didn't want to break my diet and decided to bring a prepped meal to eat in the car before we went in.\n\nShe discovered what I was doing and got really upset. She called me an asshole for not putting aside my diet for one night, saying I cared more about my food intake than about our special day. She said that I was being selfish and that I should have been more considerate of her feelings since it's our anniversary.\n\nI feel conflicted. On one hand, I understand where she's coming from, and I didn't mean to upset her. On the other hand, I've worked really hard to improve my health and I'm scared of falling back into old habits.\n\nAITA for sticking to my diet even on our anniversary?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "YTA\nJust for 1 meal. If you cannot control yourself after 1 meal for your beloved then that's a major problem. \n\nI surf and turf everyday with my partner. He is 5'9 and 130 pounds. We don't control the quantity of what we eat. It's literally impossible for us to gain weight. Well we can if we work out and gain muscle weight. But not possible for us to gain fat. It's not about calories it's solely about what your eat. We have no carbs or sugar in our diet. We are lean as hell. No fat just muscles and bones. You'll be surprised we eat surf and turf.  That's like meat, seafood, saturated fat, salads, eggs. You can eat as much as you want if there's no sugar and carbs and watch those sauces. I think you might be doing your diet wrong and you are letting it ruin your relationship. Not being able to enjoy food together is rough.", "Sorry but YTA. you've done really well but she wanted one night without having to think about this. It is possible to eat healthy andi f you view food that dangerously, tell her it's up to her to make sure you don't back slide.  I mean it's one mean dude. really.", "YTA - You can still eat healthy dining out AND be a good boyfriend. Healthy eating habits need to be able to incorporate into a realistic lifestyle.

If your hiding in your car you already know you're being sneaky.", "YTA this is a form of disordered eating and you cannot maintain this for the rest of your life", "Do you exercise? Eating clean and diet is fine but nothing is better than exercise. You can even go out and enjoy meals as long as you do more exercise.

First lbs are always the hardest, as well as building the routine. \n\nHowever, you could have saved a lot of trouble by discussing the plan before the meal/anniversary. There has to been a restaurant that you both could have agreed to beforehand (ie a place that serves food within your guidelines. Personally, I find sushi restaurants are best to meet my dieting and my partners desire for a fancier meal). You have to have understood how you not eating and watching her eat would kill the mood.", "YTA\n\nYou have choices and this is an extreme one. This diet is interfering with life. Even when doctors thought I couldn\u2019t have milk in any food, there were still foods I could eat places. If you cannot trust yourself enough to eat sensibly out, then by your reasoning, you will relapse any time you eat restaurant food. You need to figure out how to eat out and then go back to your diet. Who eats a meal in the parking lot knowing they are meeting another person? Eating together is part of human interaction. You need to find a nutritionist that can help you develop a plan of action going forward. Otherwise, you will encounter more times where people are angry at you. I don\u2019t know if you were a binge eater, but I think you need to talk to your doctor. There are places and therapists for support and help.", "what do you mean improve your health? yeah you aren't overweight anymore, but you just disordered yourself in the other direction. \n\nYTA.", "YTA. Why didn't you find a restaurant with a menu that included meals within the right calorie range for you? There are loads of places that are health aware and offer diet friendly options. Your GF thought you guys were going out for an anniversary dinner, and instead you ate in the car and watched her eat her dinner at the restaurant? I feel like she's rightfully bothered, that's a pretty awkward night out for what should have been a special evening for you both.", "YTA. OP is allowed to keep to their calorie restrictions, but OP could have done so with food from the actual restaurant. I'm pretty sure it would have had low calorie options, salad, soup, plain protein, something. It sounds like OP didn't even bother to look up the restaurant menu online first before making a meal to eat in the car. Is the gf supposed to eat alone while OP just watches while drinking a beer. On their anniversary? \n\nI almost went with them both being shitty, because this is a discussion that should have taken place during the planning process. But the fact that OP chose to carve out calories for alcohol and not a meal and just ate in the car with the gf tipped it the other way.", "I\u2019m going to say ESH. You should have communicated with her instead of just doing. She obviously doesn\u2019t seem to respect how important this change in well-being is for you. I think you guys have a lot of conversations to have surrounding well-being changes to ensure you both are growing together and not apart. \n\nAlso, recommendation for eating out, try ordering similar food that you are eating at home. Ask for veggies without butter. Etc. Pick places that have healthier options.", "My friend. Are you absolutely sure you don't have an ED? \n\nI'm not going to say your TA because although you are doing your gf wrong, I think there's maybe a bigger issue here. Your extreme diet control is worrying. \n\nI think you may want to talk to someone - maybe a doctor - about this.", "YTA. \n\nNot for sticking with your diet, but because you didn't discuss this with your girlfriend ahead of time. Eating meals together is a social bonding thing for many people. You don't have to do your social bonding that way - but if you planned to go out for a meal together, you shouldn't be springing it on her that haha, no, you didn't really mean it, she's going to eat and you're going to just watch her. Your job is to talk to her ahead of time and find something that will work for both of you. \n\nAlso, you sound pretty judgey about her diet and her cooking, and that's gross. Don't be that guy.\n\nNow, and this is aside from the asshole bit - you might really do well to think about your relationship with food. Both the addictive bit, and the judge bit. I feel like everyone gets to decide their own diet, but what you have going on is extreme (not in itself a bad thing) and it doesn't sound like you've figured out how to manage it without hurting the people around you. This is what therapy is great for.", "NTA", "YTA. You got serious issues man", "YTA\n\nI can empathize with so much of what you're saying OP, but most nice restaurants have options that should accommodate your diet.\n\nAnd as someone who has struggled with their weight I think your all or nothing attitude with food is going to blow up on you eventually, best of luck", "YTA,", "YTA. It\u2019s all about moderation. Part of dieting and getting healthy is learning how to make smart, appropriate choices in settings like a restaurant.

One bad meal, even a binge, should not wreck you given what you\u2019ve accomplished.

You should be really proud of yourself for recognizing that you needed to make a change, but I think that I have to agree with some of the other commenters - you're getting into orthorexia territory, if not other eating disorders.\n\nIf you want to keep the weight off, you need to find a way to balance your health and weight goals with living life, because this behavior isn't sustainable. Just out of curiousity, are you back in the gym, or are you still avoiding it after the fainting incident? I'd encourage you to start going back, if you haven't, since lifting weights is a great way to build muscle in addition to burning fat, helping keep your metabolism high.\n\nSo, yeah, I'm going with a soft YTA, because I've dealt with an eating disorder and I understand where your brain was, but also why your girlfriend is reasonably upset. You've centered your life around food, not living.", "If it\u2019s a nice restaurant, surely they have salmon, chicken breast, vegetables, salads, or something within your dietary restrictions.  It doesn\u2019t mean you have to go crazy.  You can decide to cut the portions in half at the beginning of the meal if it\u2019s too much food, and then take home leftovers.  If you saved Calories for drinks, then you should have used those calories for a meal and skipped the drinks.  Sometimes, having a large glass of water or an apple before the meal will keep you from overeating.\n\nI won\u2019t say your TA.  You are taking care of your health and trying your best.  I applaud you for trying to stick with your plan. It is hard to be addicted to food because many social activities involve food and people take it personally if you don\u2019t participate.", "Nta for wanting to stick to your diet. However, researching menu items to determine what you could eat there without tanking your goals would have been a better option. No one wants to go out and eat with someone when the other person is just watching them eat.", "No one here is an asshole.

Where have they been all my life!?", "I'm not sure what you mean by \"fancy,\" but most high end/fine dining restaurants are happy to accommodate dietary restrictions.", "YTA ONE meal it was only one meal, and as it was planed in advance you had ample opportunity to either chose a restaurant that offers healthy food and look at the menu in advance to plan what you were going to eat to be able to keep you calories in check for the day if you insisted on it.\nWhat did you even do at the restaurant, drank whilst you GF was eating? What a messed up behavior.", "This is going to get buried so I\u2019m not sure if you\u2019ll actually see it, but I\u2019m going to write it anyway. \n\nI lost a little over 100lbs almost 8 years ago, and I\u2019ve been maintaining that ever since (with some fluctuation here and there). I 100% understand where you are coming from here.

You still need to live life, and enjoy things, including food. It\u2019s not easy to find the balance, but I promise you, it\u2019s possible. My best advice would be to look at the menu beforehand to choose a meal that best suits your dietary needs. Plan your day around it if you need to by having a lighter lunch/breakfast, etc. Or order wherever you want, eat it, forgive yourself, and move on. Back on track for the next meal.

You can ask these things and the worst they can do is say no, but I doubt they will. If you do not learn how to eat in different environments, you are doing yourself a disservice, imo.

And one of the most important pieces was completely relearning my relationship with food.\nI get what you're doing and why you feel the way you currently do about food. But it's not sustainable or healthy to think about food that way. Food is food. It's fuel for our bodies. Some of it is better fuel, but at the end of the day it's all still food, and sometimes it's okay to eat the tasty food. It's also a lot easier to not fall into that pattern you're afraid of if you are occasionally indulging in less than perfectly healthy foods - it's less of a temptation if it's still \"allowed\" so to speak. It's great that you're learning what a healthy diet looks like. At some point though you need to find your way to a place where you can let yourself eat out. It's really hard to socialize much when you're bound by such a rigid diet, and it's healthy to practice moderation. I'm not saying this is something you need to figure out right now all at once, I'm just saying at some point you need to find more balance. \nI do sort of count my calories, but I'm mostly at the point where I can recognize what a healthy meal looks like without having to break it down to that level. Practice flexibility, because it will make this journey so much better for you in the long run. You say you've been doing this for years, what is your plan when you reach a healthy weight? You need to start thinking long term, and that includes sustainable lifelong habits.", "Have you been followed by a nutritionist or even a psychologist?
