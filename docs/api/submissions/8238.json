He is educated and has a good career and I\u2019m really proud of him for his accomplishments.  Since we were kids I\u2019ve always noticed he had really bad hygiene habits, but chalked it up to him being a teenage boy.  Now that we\u2019re older I\u2019ve seen that his hygiene has not improved with age.  He goes to the gym at least 3 times per week but never showers more than once per week, never brushes his teeth, and only does laundry when the clothes are completely stiff.  I\u2019ve dropped little hints like if we stay the night somewhere together I\u2019ll ask if he packed shower supplies, and in the mornings I\u2019ll offer to leave my toothpaste out if he wants to use it.  I\u2019ve found myself no longer inviting him places because it\u2019s embarrassing when he shows up greasy, smelly and with an inch thick of plaque on his teeth.  \n\nLast month he told me he had a crush on one of my newer friends and asked if she was single.  I told him that she was, but only recently single and isn\u2019t looking for anything right now.  He wouldn\u2019t take no for an answer and decided to contact her himself to ask her out.  When she declined, she lied and said she was seeing someone.  He knew that one of us was lying to him.  When he confronted me I told him that everyone I know thinks he is disgusting because of his hygiene, they don\u2019t want to be near him much less date him.  He denied having bad hygiene, and said he does shower and brush his teeth.  He left, and hasn\u2019t talked to me in over a month insisting I need to apologize and set the record straight to everyone we know.  I think I\u2019m doing him a favor in the long run and he should appreciate my honesty because he is the one who confronted me about why I lied to him about my friend.

Otherwise he can\u2018t expect people to be willingly around him, even less to want to get intimate with him.", "NTA\n\nI might write a gentle note to him, apologizing for hurting his feelings, but clearly telling him that while yes, he does shower and brush his teeth, he does so much less frequently than he should. Then tell him that other people shower daily (and always after a workout) and brush their teeth twice a day. That he is welcome to ask his physician, as a neutral third party, his/her thoughts on it.\n\nThen I would leave it.\n\nYour friend is in denial that something's wrong, and is grasping at straws (\"I do shower!\" even though it only seems to happen in Olympic years).\n\nI don't think apologizing for what you said (rather than for hurting his feelings) and pretending like YOU were wrong for pointing out the truth is the way to go. Either way, it's hard to see how this friendship continues - even just as friends hanging out with someone *\"greasy, smelly and with an inch thick of plaque on his teeth*\" doesn't seem ideal.", "NTA. However, you say he's been like this since he was a teenager, so it's likely no one at his home talked about how he should brush his teeth every day and shower more than once a week and when to do laundry. \n\n\"Hey, it's considered the norm to shower daily, wash most clothes after 1-2 we are, and brush your teeth twice a day. It appears that you don't do that, so your dating pool may be limited to those who feel the same way.\" \n\nIf he insists that brushes his teeth daily, but you still think he doesn't due to bad breath/tooth condition, suggest a dentist to find the root of the problem.

While I don't have the same horrible hygiene he has, I do have my flaws and I wouldn't stop talking to my best friend for simply pointing them out to me.\n\nAlso, he seems to think that you... badmouthed him to your friends or something? Why would he demand you \"set the record straight\"? NTA. He needs a reality check", "NTA words probably could have been more carefully selected but I mean he asked and I don\u2019t think you were fully prepared to speak on it.

So your best bet was to keep it 100 with him. \n\n>He denied having bad hygiene, and said he does shower and brush his teeth\n\nHe's gotten so use to his bad habits and his smells that he refuse to believe that it's him.

Stink fetish?\nIdk, idc.\n\nPersonally I was in slumps often. But after so many days I can\u2019t stand the feeling of skin and hair anymore. And my teeth hurt after 2 days without brushing them anyway.\n\nPlus: I paid enough money to fix holes in the past(which is also quite expensive in Switzerland) so that alone is reason enough to brush regularly.\n\nWell\u2026he might learn it eventually\u2026and maybe he apologises to you\u2026or not.\nI would certainly keep my distance if all helping him is answered this way\u2026.", "More info needed - how did you approach the conversation with your friend, and how exactly did you tell him his bad hygiene causes his loneliness?\n\nHonesty without tact is cruelty.

You think he\u2019s great and has all the good qualities. Instead of saying gently that his hygiene needs some work you tell him he\u2019s disgusting. \n\nIs it disgusting if he smells and has bad breath...yes. Was it necessary to tell him he\u2019s disgusting? Absolutely not. I\u2019m probably going to get downvoted here, ESH. You for being brutal and him for having terrible hygiene in the first place.", "NTA - you tried to be subtle about this but that didnt work. Eventually he gave you no choice and you answered his question.", "NTA Though, I think you could have been a bit gentler mentioning it's possibly his special brand of odour/hygiene rather than telling him he's degusting.", "It\u2019s odd that you waited this long to say anything and that you handled it the way you did. \n\u201cBro, if you want to date her you need to shower daily, brush your teeth twice a day and do your laundry every week.\u201d \n\nI\u2019d apologize for your harsh delivery and I\u2019m going to say yta because you\u2019ve been smelling him for over 10 years and never told him.

Nothing wrong with that!", "Not sure how you remained best friends for that long tbh", "NTA. \nI ask my SO all the time if  no I stink or if something is off about my appearance. Because I\u2019d rather know than get embarrassed. Same with my mom. I\u2019d rather they point out if something a going on with my appearance than let me go out with like a stain on my shirt or a mysterious smell. \n\nA few months ago my SO was going through something and started letting his hygiene and grooming habits slide. I was trying to be gentle about, but direct. But everyone else was saying he looked homeless. He didn\u2019t want to hear it. He had a long shaggy beard, he\u2019d go around in old ripped and dirty wife beaters, basket ball shorts and sandals. \n\nMy mother works outside at a booth. In her area there are a lot of outreach for the homeless because the city has a sadly large amount of homeless people. My husband and I went to go visit her at work. And while she and I were talking one of the volunteers walked up to my husband and gave him some clothes and shoes. It was at that moment he realized he needed to do something about his appearance. \n\nMaybe OP should let her friend find out the hard way that he need to do something about his hygiene.", "I really want to know the answer to this\u2026", "I think I painted a picture that\u2019s slightly off or maybe since I\u2019ve been around him for pretty much my entire life I\u2019m nose blinded to the smell. Sometimes when I\u2019m in a closed up car his breath makes my nose burn but he doesn\u2019t smell bad most of the time that I\u2019ve noticed.  He applies deodorant like 4 times/day.  The main problem is how dirty he looks.  (Greasy, cheesy teeth, dirty/stained clothes)", "It could also be something like ADHD.  It can make it difficult to form habits, mess with your sense of time, and negatively effect motivation.", "yeah but you should brush your teeth twice a day. And wash your hands and face and ears and genitals and arsehole and armpits. So you may as well take a shower. You might be able to get away with not washing those areas if you are just at home by yourself, but not me, they all insist on a daily wash or it is uncomfortable. Also I'm pretty sure my scalp really wants one too.\n\nIt might be that your body gets used to you washing so much and then gets overloaded with grime when you miss your schedule.", "Fair enough, oh I forgot to mention NTA. I think you\u2019ve done him a favour in the long run, it\u2019s something he needs to come to terms with and if he can\u2019t, there\u2019s nothing you can do about it. Reality is that some friendships won\u2019t last and if he chooses to cut you from his life, it\u2019s his loss, and honestly, from a third party perspective, it\u2019s probably better for you anyways.", "Ah, one of those.  Deodorant just adds a new, less offensive smell that is (usually) enough to mask standard BO - it's not gonna cover up fortified elite funk.  It's a band-aid, not a cure.\n\nThis is a starting point if he is open to discussing further.  Clearly he cares at least a LITTLE - he uses more deodorant more than I do!  He just needs a reality check that there is no substitute for actual hygiene", "My partner does this - he then washes all his shirts at once, like every couple of months or so", "Just a fyi loofahs are actually disgusting. Don't use them unless you can afford to use a new one every week... You can't clean them and they harbor bacteria just like sponges.. Except you don't use sponges on your nether bits...", "This is so true.  I had a crappy primary care doctor for 2 years.  (Called me obese based solely on BMI...I was a size 2 and did crossfit back then.)  One winter, I can this round circular rash on my thigh that itched.  It looked kind of similar to ringworm but was more red.  She prescribed this very harsh soap and advised to not use lotion because it would spread.  And spread it did anyway!  I was so itchy all over and couldn't sleep.  She prescribed me this oral medicine that came with risks and a strong antihistamine.  Called it in.  \n\nLuckily, I went with my husband to his dermatologist appt right after.  He called me in and asked me to show the doctor my \"ringworm\".  The doctor took one look and said it was nummular eczema and said he wasn't surprised it was spreading with my very dry skin.  I was given some acetone-based cream and he told me to use Cetaphil to repair my skin barrier.  He also told me to stop immediately using those soaps and to toss out, recommending a mild soap.  He said we don't need to soap up our limbs if I wasn't muddy or anything like that, just primarily underarms, groin area, feet bottom and belly button.  And we don't need to necessarily shower every day, especially during cold weather and if we hadn't sweat and had a bidet.  \n\nI was super pissed because I spent weeks getting crap sleep and she was about to prescribe me a risky med.  We have bidets on every toilet now.  I still shower almost daily but soap only where needed with Neutrogena Rainbath soap.", "He may have been some type of narcissist.  They sometimes lack good hygiene and can also manipulate.  Glad your friend got out.", "When I was at uni my neighbour was from Thailand. He were on the same group of 4 rooms that shared a bathroom. He would shower 3 times a day. Even in the depths of Melbourne winters he said he just didn\u2019t feel clean if he didn\u2019t shower so much. I did think he was wasting a lot of water during a drought, but I guess we all get used to a certain level of personal hygiene.", "I live in an arid desert climate and have dry skin. I also work in an office and have stationary hobbies. If I consistently shower every day I get dry, itchy patches of skin. I usually only shower every other day unless I've been more active or got sweaty that day. I can only wash my hair 2-3 times a week though, even in the summer.", "Well yes. But also the frequency you need to touroughly wash some areas of the body differs. Washing your legs with soap every week or two usually keeps them plenty clean.", "It's ridiculous!", "Same. If I have stress/sick sweat the smell is horrific, otherwise I'm good bathing every 3/4 days.", "Lord knows I have the deodorant argument with my teen son enough. I just don\u2019t get it, we\u2019ve taught him better and he knows. He just doesn\u2019t want to", "My kids not even ten and I'm already starting to teach about sweat smell and the value of his daily shower - and the why we need to use the soap cause standing in the water isnt going to cut it - because he's beginning to get the boy funk boys get in their teens, I can't believe people would just not teach their kids about this scrap is it cause they're embarrassed about bodies?", "I definitely can fall in to depressive funks where I don't leave the house and don't shower. Difference being I \\*\\*KNOW\\*\\* it's borderline and I don't take it too far. EG today I am day . . . 4 of no shower? And it has to be the last day because 1) I'm getting a little gross and 2) I'm going to the office tomorrow", "I remember reading a study once about how people with depression take longer, hotter showers because it replaces the lack of intimacy/comfort they aren't able to get in real life. I felt called out af...\n\nThere are many people with severe depression that can't even get out of bed for days for anything more than the most basic of nutrients and barely anything resembling self care (clean the dishes? room? Can barely shovel cereal into my mouth hole, how do you expect me to do that?), but we can almost always curl up into a ball under a near-boiling temperature stream of water for 30 minutes.", "Pretty bad when a dudes underwear get stiff, especially if they wear boxers lol. I can understand things happen with socks or whatever lmao but damn to get a dudes underwear stiff takes a truly unrealized non-effort in that case. Never have I ever, anyone?", "I would, but he's not on reddit. I don't think he even knows what reddit is, lol.", "Unfortunately my ex friend had this. After high school she decided she didn't need to shower or wear anything to cover up the smell.  She would hug me and  Unfortunately smelled like armpit.", "Thank you for this suggestion. I have hyperhydrosis and it is incredibly hard to find a deo.", "Keep fighting the good fight!", "I\u2019m one of those people that don\u2019t smell, which is fortunate since I also have chronic depression that makes me not give a flying f when I\u2019m unmedicated. This is just to say that it\u2019s not a bit uncommon for some depressed people to go for long periods of neglecting personal hygiene. For me, it\u2019s not that a shower/being clean doesn\u2019t feel better than being grubby \u2014 it\u2019s that the effort is nearly insurmountable. \n\nThe longer-showers thing is definitely interesting, though. When I get in there, I do stay for 15-20 mins. Maybe I need more hugs!!", "Yep. This is a depressed person\u2019s little trick. Don\u2019t want to shower? At least change socks and underwear. Even better whole outfit. Helps a lot.", "Agreed on this. Plus to add on if you\u2019re  in the middle of an episode but not full on for depression you may also have enough energy to do a wipes or wet papertowels on essential areas (privates, armpits, etc.)", "I threw up in my mouth just reading this. So, thanks for that. NTA. Was he raised by humans?", "This is one of those \"don't shame issues that someone can't fix in 10 minutes.\" Except in this case, his issues all CAN be fixed in 10 minutes and need criticizing and fixing. OP, definitely NTA.", "I picked a bad day to be literate.", "This is what I don\u2019t understand. I had to have a \u201cnobody likes the smelly kid\u201d conversation with my now husband when we first started dating. He actually was following good hygiene practices but using some all natural hippie products that just didn\u2019t cut it for him. We met in winter so I didn\u2019t fully realize how poor the performance of his crystal deodorant was until the weather got warmer, but we solved the smelly kid issue with one trip to the drug store. \n\nHow the hell these people been friends for years without ever having a frank conversation about hygiene?", "Indeed, very clean humans actually", "Ick.

It\u2019s fucking demeaning. She should apologize for how she brought it up, offer support and suggestions if he\u2019s willing to work on it and explain that while she expressed it in a HORRIBLE way, it\u2019s very much a common sentiment between mutual friends and even if he IS showering and brushing his teeth, something is going on that needs to be addressed.", "I know right!  I think this dude has some mental health issues going on.", "This is a good suggestion. It allows for the problem to be addressed (friend smells bad, clothes are crusty, teeth never look brushed) without it being what the friend has perceived as a personal attack, causing him to meet it with defensiveness and denial. Like, \"Ok...you shower and brush your teeth daily. Then something is wrong because it doesn't seem like you do at all! You should probably see your doctor/dermatologist to find out what could be causing this problem\". I think it's unlikely he has a medical issue causing this. It sounds like he just doesn't prioritize hygiene and doesn't want to admit it. But shifting it from a character flaw to an observable reality that exists, regardless of the reason, might motivate him to go ahead and step up his hygiene game. Or go to the doctor and be conclusively told that he has some condition that causes excess odor, plaque buildup and crunchy clothes. Or that he in fact, is not practicing basic hygiene adequately.", "You guys have clearly never met people with a schizoid personality disorder. Their parents can teach them all the proper hygiene in the world, it won't change anything.

Makes it over produce the oils to compensate.", "https://youtu.be/bu5vrh47Uw4", "Yea or if I eat gummy bears or anything with sugar powder some of my teeth at the top really hurt", "I think most of the \"skin damage\" people, like me, live somewhere that has dry winter air. Showering with cool water when you're already someplace cold is not fun, but hot water will tend to dry your skin out more than it already is from the weather, leading to chapped, flaking skin that can crack and bleed. I'm assuming that in hot humid weather you're showering like I do in summer with cool water because it feels refreshing, which isn't going to hurt anything.", "That reminds me of a gross quote I once read, allegedly by Mao Zedong, who was said to not be a regular bather and was promiscuous in his youth: \u201cI wash my penis in the vaginas of my women.\u201d \n\nI\u2019m not finding any evidence of this online, though, so maybe I read it in a book somewhere.

Wow. Thanks for this. I always just figured it had to do with my oh balance because of a medical condition or an effect of a medication I'm on. But no,I've always had dry ear wax too.
