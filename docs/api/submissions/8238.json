He is educated and has a good career and I\u2019m really proud of him for his accomplishments.  Since we were kids I\u2019ve always noticed he had really bad hygiene habits, but chocked it up to him being a teenage boy.  Now that we\u2019re older I\u2019ve seen that his hygiene has not improved with age.  He goes to the gym at least 3 times per week but never showers more than once per week, never brushes his teeth, and only does laundry when the clothes are completely stiff.  I\u2019ve dropped little hints like if we stay the night somewhere together I\u2019ll ask if he packed shower supplies, and in the mornings I\u2019ll offer to leave my toothpaste out if he wants to use it.  I\u2019ve found myself no longer inviting him places because it\u2019s embarrassing when he shows up greasy, smelly and with an inch thick of plaque on his teeth.  \n\nLast month he told me he had a crush on one of my newer friends and asked if she was single.  I told him that she was, but only recently single and isn\u2019t looking for anything right now.  He wouldn\u2019t take no for an answer and decided to contact her himself to ask her out.  When she declined, she lied and said she was seeing someone.  He knew that one of us was lying to him.  When he confronted me I told him that everyone I know thinks he is disgusting because of his hygiene, they don\u2019t want to be near him much less date him.  He denied having bad hygiene, and said he does shower and brush his teeth.  He left, and hasn\u2019t talked to me in over a month insisting I need to apologize and set the record straight to everyone we know.  I think I\u2019m doing him a favor in the long run and he should appreciate my honesty because he is the one who confronted me about why I lied to him about my friend.

Otherwise he can\u2018t expect people to be willingly around him, even less to want to get intimate with him.", "NTA\n\nI might write a gentle note to him, apologizing for hurting his feelings, but clearly telling him that while yes, he does shower and brush his teeth, he does so much less frequently than he should. Then tell him that other people shower daily (and always after a workout) and brush their teeth twice a day. That he is welcome to ask his physician, as a neutral third party, his/her thoughts on it.\n\nThen I would leave it.\n\nYour friend is in denial that something's wrong, and is grasping at straws (\"I do shower!\" even though it only seems to happen in Olympic years).\n\nI don't think apologizing for what you said (rather than for hurting his feelings) and pretending like YOU were wrong for pointing out the truth is the way to go. Either way, it's hard to see how this friendship continues - even just as friends hanging out with someone *\"greasy, smelly and with an inch thick of plaque on his teeth*\" doesn't seem ideal.", "NTA. However, you say he's been like this since he was a teenager, so it's likely no one at his home talked about how he should brush his teeth every day and shower more than once a week and when to do laundry. \n\n\"Hey, it's considered the norm to shower daily, wash most clothes after 1-2 we are, and brush your teeth twice a day. It appears that you don't do that, so your dating pool may be limited to those who feel the same way.\" \n\nIf he insists that brushes his teeth daily, but you still think he doesn't due to bad breath/tooth condition, suggest a dentist to find the root of the problem. (the show Ted Lasso had a good story arc about bad breath that was actually caused by antihistamines and some solutions)", "Look, I happen to be a 26 yo boy myself, and by coincidence I also happen to be best friends with a girl (yes, redditors, opposite-sex best friends exist). While I don't have the same horrible hygiene he has, I do have my flaws and I wouldn't stop talking to my best friend for simply pointing them out to me.\n\nAlso, he seems to think that you... badmouthed him to your friends or something? Why would he demand you \"set the record straight\"? NTA. He needs a reality check", "NTA words probably could have been more carefully selected but I mean he asked and I don\u2019t think you were fully prepared to speak on it. It was a private conversation not around others so yeah.", "I can't believe you've not told them before, you're some friend. \nThere used to be a guy like that in my friend group, after much ribbing & us all buying him socks, deodourant, we even booked him into a dentist. And now his hygiene is fine. NTA for telling him straight.", "I think you are NTA. He asked and you answered. \n\nYou even tried it other ways, but he didn't get it. I would rather have my friend tell me, than everyone speaking behind my back. Even if it hurt at first, if he tries to change, it will help him. Not only with women, i think with friends and colleagues too.", "NTA.\n\n>He wouldn\u2019t take no for an answer and decuded to contact her himself to ask her out\n\nThis is alarming.\n\nThat being said, you tried the subtle approach and it didn\u2019t work. So your best bet was to keep it 100 with him. \n\n>He denied having bad hygiene, and said he does shower and brush his teeth\n\nHe's gotten so use to his bad habits and his smells that he refuse to believe that it's him. He won\u2019t better his hygiene so there really isn\u2019t any point anymore. He will hopefully learn the hard way but only time will tell", "\ud83e\udd22 like my ex-SIL.\n\nMy wife already has a super sensitive nose. And my brothers/father smoke, so they probably didn\u2019t notice it as much.\n\nBut my grandma broke her own arm one time, and SIL offered to help her. And that stench every day, when she was really close to my grandma must have been intense\u2026and my grandma, bless her, always has her heart on the tongue, so she of course asked her if she can\u2019t use Deo, shower more often, or do SOMETHING\u2026please\u2026\n\nAnd for whatever reason my brother claimed he loved that on her? Stink fetish?\nIdk, idc.\n\nPersonally I was in slumps often. But after so many days I can\u2019t stand the feeling of skin and hair anymore. And my teeth hurt after 2 days without brushing them anyway.\n\nPlus: I paid enough money to fix holes in the past(which is also quite expensive in Switzerland) so that alone is reason enough to brush regularly.\n\nWell\u2026he might learn it eventually\u2026and maybe he apologises to you\u2026or not.\nI would certainly keep my distance if all helping him is answered this way\u2026.", "More info needed - how did you approach the conversation with your friend, and how exactly did you tell him his bad hygiene causes his loneliness?\n\nHonesty without tact is cruelty.

If you approached the feedback about his hygiene more caring and thoughtful way and he still reacted badly, then possibly NTA. \n\nMore context needed", "Friends need to be brutally honest sometimes. I don\u2019t think you\u2019re the A**hole. There can be reasons for poor hygiene such as being autistic, as sensory issues and other traits can make showering and brushing teeth difficult. You need to have a frank conversation about why they aren\u2019t looking after their hygiene.", "NTA. He needs to go to the dentist, use an electric toothbrush and anti-tartar toothpaste, floss twice daily, use umouthwash, shower frequently and wash his clothes weekly.", "Let me get this straight\u2026\n\nThis person is your best friend. You think he\u2019s great and has all the good qualities. Instead of saying gently that his hygiene needs some work you tell him he\u2019s disgusting. \n\nIs it disgusting if he smells and has bad breath...yes. Was it necessary to tell him he\u2019s disgusting? Absolutely not. I\u2019m probably going to get downvoted here, ESH. You for being brutal and him for having terrible hygiene in the first place.", "NTA - you tried to be subtle about this but that didnt work. Eventually he gave you no choice and you answered his question.", "NTA Though, I think you could have been a bit gentler mentioning it's possibly his special brand of odour/hygiene rather than telling him he's degusting.", "It\u2019s odd that you waited this long to say anything and that you handled it the way you did. \n\u201cBro, if you want to date her you need to shower daily, brush your teeth twice a day and do your laundry every week.\u201d\n\nI\u2019d apologize for your harsh delivery and I\u2019m going to say YTA because you\u2019ve been smelling him for over 10 years and never helped him out. If you just noticed, that would be embarrassing but to know your best friend has thought you were smelly and intentionally not invited you to things because of it, but never told you!

You were helping him by telling him the truth. Brushing teeth needs to happen at least twice a day. Showering after the gym is necessary. And clothing must be washed before it can stand on its own. \n\nHe probably needs a good dental cleaning. Dental hygiene is so important.", "NTA but if you are best friends why didn't you talk to him about his hygiene like 10 years ago?

But I was 17 at the time and it took my boss calling me into his office and basically telling me hey you stink. Do you need me to buy you soap and new work clothes? I was mortified, but it was necessary. OP he\u2019s just upset because he\u2019s embarassed as he should be. You did the right thing.", "NTA. you will never be a bad friend for encouraging someone to improve their hygiene, it\u2019s only a matter of how you go about it.

I apologize\" \"Uh, no, we know him, he's actually pretty filthy on a regular basis\"\n\nThe most you should do is tell him you're sorry you hurt him, but you couldn't stand to see him being hurt by his loneliness when you knew there was something he could do to help himself. Then reiterate that he needs to at least shower after every gym session and brush his teeth 2-3 times a day. And he needs to see the dentist. Because he's still going to have bad breath if he has rotting teeth.", "Reading through all your comments, NTA. Your friend has not responded to any gentle advice from either you or his parents through the years.\n\nUnfortunately, he is so stubborn that the only hope he had was to receive an emotional slap. He doesn't want to change. You telling him he's disgusting and why, and how it affects his social life, is exactly what he needed to hear. And of course, he still doesn't want to hear it, because he doesn't want to believe it and doesn't want to change.\n\nHe's doubled down, and it really doesn't matter why - stubbornness, depression, spectrum issues, whatever it could possibly be. He does not want to change, but at least he knows what you think, and has been informed what other people think. No one else has let him know the extent of his revulsion to others. If he doesn't want to be friends with you after this, I'm sorry but this is absolutely the correct hill for YOU to die on.

Doesn\u2019t brush his teeth? Ugh.", "Also wash their clothes after 1 wear for shirts and underwear.", "Odds are, OP didn't bad mouth him at all.

OP has tried.  how do you more nicely tell someone to clean the hell up, they're gross smelling?", "Yea I\u2019m gonna join the downvote train with you. He was clearly never taught proper hygiene, and that\u2019s really sad. Imagine the level of neglect and possibly abuse someone has to experience to get to his age and still think it\u2019s normal to only shower once per week and to not wash their clothes until they\u2019re stiff.\n\nIt\u2019s clear that he needed someone to be very direct with him, but you can be direct without calling someone disgusting. If this is my best friend, I\u2019m gonna start out  that conversation by telling him that I\u2019m about to say something that\u2019ll be hard to hear, but that it\u2019s coming from a place of trying to help him so that he has a second to prepare mentally and get in the right frame of mind to hear constructive feedback. Then I\u2019ll explain the social norms around hygiene and the impact it can have on dating. \n\nInstead, it seems he was emotionally blindsided and has now gone into anger and denial rather than listening to OP\u2019s feedback.\n\nESH.", "I left out a lot of context for the sake of brevity.

I know his family well, he was absolutely not neglected and actually had a private bathroom connected to his bedroom growing up and was upper middle class.  I appreciate you guys being empathetic but it just doesn\u2019t apply.  I witnessed his parents countless times trying to get him to brush his teeth or shower.  There came a point where it seemed like his mom found it weird to be hounding her 17 year old to brush his teeth and would instead tell him things like \u201cyou\u2019d better take care of them cause when they all rot and fall out you\u2019re gonna regret it.\u201d  We all assumed with age and maturity he would just naturally start caring about hygiene but it never happened.  He seems to think all of us are oblivious because he would often lie about brushing his teeth/showering when we could all tell he clearly hadn\u2019t done either all week.  I\u2019ve been abused in my childhood and adolescence so I get the catastrophic thinking, and I definitely considered it as a possibility, but it\u2019s just not.", "He's clearly got some mental block on taking care of himself, and is being self destructive. No different than say disordered eating if he was eating his way into obesity due to mental issue. He need therapy to break his habits, because clearly directly pointing it out has caused his mental walls to go up."]}
