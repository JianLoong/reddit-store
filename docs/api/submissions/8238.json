He is educated and has a good career and I\u2019m really proud of him for his accomplishments.  Since we were kids I\u2019ve always noticed he had really bad hygiene habits, but chocked it up to him being a teenage boy.  Now that we\u2019re older I\u2019ve seen that his hygiene has not improved with age.  He goes to the gym at least 3 times per week but never showers more than once per week, never brushes his teeth, and only does laundry when the clothes are completely stiff.  I\u2019ve dropped little hints like if we stay the night somewhere together I\u2019ll ask if he packed shower supplies, and in the mornings I\u2019ll offer to leave my toothpaste out if he wants to use it.  I\u2019ve found myself no longer inviting him places because it\u2019s embarrassing when he shows up greasy, smelly and with an inch thick of plaque on his teeth.  \n\nLast month he told me he had a crush on one of my newer friends and asked if she was single.  I told him that she was, but only recently single and isn\u2019t looking for anything right now.  He wouldn\u2019t take no for an answer and decided to contact her himself to ask her out.  When she declined, she lied and said she was seeing someone.  He knew that one of us was lying to him.  When he confronted me I told him that everyone I know thinks he is disgusting because of his hygiene, they don\u2019t want to be near him much less date him.  He denied having bad hygiene, and said he does shower and brush his teeth.  He left, and hasn\u2019t talked to me in over a month insisting I need to apologize and set the record straight to everyone we know.  I think I\u2019m doing him a favor in the long run and he should appreciate my honesty because he is the one who confronted me about why I lied to him about my friend.

Otherwise he can\u2018t expect people to be willingly around him, even less to want to get intimate with him.", "NTA\n\nI might write a gentle note to him, apologizing for hurting his feelings, but clearly telling him that while yes, he does shower and brush his teeth, he does so much less frequently than he should. Then tell him that other people shower daily (and always after a workout) and brush their teeth twice a day. That he is welcome to ask his physician, as a neutral third party, his/her thoughts on it.\n\nThen I would leave it.\n\nYour friend is in denial that something's wrong, and is grasping at straws (\"I do shower!\" even though it only seems to happen in Olympic years).\n\nI don't think apologizing for what you said (rather than for hurting his feelings) and pretending like YOU were wrong for pointing out the truth is the way to go.

However, you say he's been like this since he was a teenager, so it's likely no one at his home talked about how he should brush his teeth every day and shower more than once a week and when to do laundry. \n\n\"Hey, it's considered the norm to shower daily, wash most clothes after 1-2 we are, and brush your teeth twice a day. It appears that you don't do that, so your dating pool may be limited to those who feel the same way.\" \n\nIf he insists that brushes his teeth daily, but you still think he doesn't due to bad breath/tooth condition, suggest a dentist to find the root of the problem.

While I don't have the same horrible hygiene he has, I do have my flaws and I wouldn't stop talking to my best friend for simply pointing them out to me.\n\nAlso, he seems to think that you... badmouthed him to your friends or something? Why would he demand you \"set the record straight\"? NTA.

So your best bet was to keep it 100 with him. \n\n>He denied having bad hygiene, and said he does shower and brush his teeth\n\nHe's gotten so use to his bad habits and his smells that he refuse to believe that it's him.

Stink fetish?\nIdk, idc.\n\nPersonally I was in slumps often. But after so many days I can\u2019t stand the feeling of skin and hair anymore. And my teeth hurt after 2 days without brushing them anyway.\n\nPlus: I paid enough money to fix holes in the past(which is also quite expensive in Switzerland) so that alone is reason enough to brush regularly.\n\nWell\u2026he might learn it eventually\u2026and maybe he apologises to you\u2026or not.\nI would certainly keep my distance if all helping him is answered this way\u2026.", "More info needed - how did you approach the conversation with your friend, and how exactly did you tell him his bad hygiene causes his loneliness?\n\nHonesty without tact is cruelty.

He does not want to change, but at least he knows what you think, and has been informed what other people think. No one else has let him know the extent of his revulsion to others.

And if you\u2019re making out with someone with gingivitis, you can contract that bacteria. Thats why we recommend that people with gum disease or use cigarettes don\u2019t kiss their kids on the mouth, because germs and substances are transmissible.", "Yup, that\u2019s how Andy Hallet died. He was an actor and singer, his tooth got infected and the infection spread to his heart, he did survive the initial infection. However, it greatly weakened his heart and he died of congestive heart failure a few years later. It\u2019s one of the reasons I am always on top of my dental hygiene.", "Consider how close your teeth are to your brain.  You do not want an infection spreading to your brain.", "My neighbor just spent 3 weeks in the hospital because of some dental bacteria that traveled to his chest and became septic. He has a couple of bad teeth he has been putting off getting removed and it nearly suffocated him from the infection filling his chest cavity and impeding his lungs inflating enough to get sufficient oxygen. Now he has daily physical therapy to rebuild atrophied muscle and function.", "Sadly he was extremely manipulative and she had very little dating experience. Bad combo. She did dump him.", "Excellent misread, made for such a hilarious comment \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "WHAT?", "Omg yes, it's bloody awful going into someone's bathroom and instantly being assaulted with the smell of towels and/or bathmats that haven't been washed for weeks \ud83e\udd2e", "This comment makes me want to brush my teeth...", "In fairness it's not up to OP to gatekeep her sex life. Giving a buddy good-faith advice is just that, advice to be taken or left.", "> You seem to think going from tiny hints straight to calling their best friend disgusting is totally fine? \n\nGuys don't take hints, they respond to direct statements!", "What I mean is... it's not OP's fault that the friend has been a total slob, nor is she responsible for fixing him now!  That, and she HAS been trying to tell him for years (plus all his other friends and family) but none of it has penetrated his thick skull until now... where's the 'betrayal'?", "I don't get it. I can smell myself after a 30 minute workout and get myself into the shower even if I'm exhausted. There is really no excuse for not bathing regularly unless you're one of those rare people who just don't smell.", "RIP Lorne, you were taken too soon. Andy was so amazing and it was a huge eye opener for me too, not that my dental hygiene was poor but any time I think about slacking I remember his story,", "Lorne from *Angel.*  What a sad, unnecessary loss.", "I appreciate you giving more info. \n\nI get that you and everyone else thought he would naturally get it together. It\u2019s totally valid to be grossed out and in a totally exasperated moment say it in a not nice way. We all do that occasionally.\n\nIMO, this sub is about judging whether you could have handled the situation better or if there was an overreaction by one party. You had a right to be exasperated with your best friend. You had a right to say something. I just feel that you bottled up your emotions with this subject and a lot of resentment towards him, then it exploded when you finally did say something. \n\nIf this were my friend I would apologize just for the delivery, because telling him he\u2019s disgusting and everyone around thinks he\u2019s disgusting is harsh to say to your best friend of 12 years. I would tell them I should\u2019ve had the conversation with them before I hit a breaking point. You are N T A for being fed up. I don\u2019t think you are wrong bringing it his attention. Just the delivery could\u2019ve been better. Maybe you and your friends need to stage an intervention?"]}
