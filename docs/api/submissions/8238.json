He is educated and has a good career and I\u2019m really proud of him for his accomplishments.  Since we were kids I\u2019ve always noticed he had really bad hygiene habits, but chocked it up to him being a teenage boy.  Now that we\u2019re older I\u2019ve seen that his hygiene has not improved with age.  He goes to the gym at least 3 times per week but never showers more than once per week, never brushes his teeth, and only does laundry when the clothes are completely stiff.  I\u2019ve dropped little hints like if we stay the night somewhere together I\u2019ll ask if he packed shower supplies, and in the mornings I\u2019ll offer to leave my toothpaste out if he wants to use it.  I\u2019ve found myself no longer inviting him places because it\u2019s embarrassing when he shows up greasy, smelly and with an inch thick of plaque on his teeth.  \n\nLast month he told me he had a crush on one of my newer friends and asked if she was single.  I told him that she was, but only recently single and isn\u2019t looking for anything right now.  He wouldn\u2019t take no for an answer and decided to contact her himself to ask her out.  When she declined, she lied and said she was seeing someone.  He knew that one of us was lying to him.  When he confronted me I told him that everyone I know thinks he is disgusting because of his hygiene, they don\u2019t want to be near him much less date him.  He denied having bad hygiene, and said he does shower and brush his teeth.  He left, and hasn\u2019t talked to me in over a month insisting I need to apologize and set the record straight to everyone we know.  I think I\u2019m doing him a favor in the long run and he should appreciate my honesty because he is the one who confronted me about why I lied to him about my friend.

Otherwise he can\u2018t expect people to be willingly around him, even less to want to get intimate with him.", "NTA\n\nI might write a gentle note to him, apologizing for hurting his feelings, but clearly telling him that while yes, he does shower and brush his teeth, he does so much less frequently than he should. Then tell him that other people shower daily (and always after a workout) and brush their teeth twice a day. That he is welcome to ask his physician, as a neutral third party, his/her thoughts on it.\n\nThen I would leave it.\n\nYour friend is in denial that something's wrong, and is grasping at straws (\"I do shower!\" even though it only seems to happen in Olympic years).\n\nI don't think apologizing for what you said (rather than for hurting his feelings) and pretending like YOU were wrong for pointing out the truth is the way to go. Either way, it's hard to see how this friendship continues - even just as friends hanging out with someone *\"greasy, smelly and with an inch thick of plaque on his teeth*\" doesn't seem ideal.", "NTA. However, you say he's been like this since he was a teenager, so it's likely no one at his home talked about how he should brush his teeth every day and shower more than once a week and when to do laundry. \n\n\"Hey, it's considered the norm to shower daily, wash most clothes after 1-2 we are, and brush your teeth twice a day. It appears that you don't do that, so your dating pool may be limited to those who feel the same way.\" \n\nIf he insists that brushes his teeth daily, but you still think he doesn't due to bad breath/tooth condition, suggest a dentist to find the root of the problem.

While I don't have the same horrible hygiene he has, I do have my flaws and I wouldn't stop talking to my best friend for simply pointing them out to me.\n\nAlso, he seems to think that you... badmouthed him to your friends or something? Why would he demand you \"set the record straight\"? NTA. He needs a reality check", "NTA words probably could have been more carefully selected but I mean he asked and I don\u2019t think you were fully prepared to speak on it.

And now his hygiene is fine. NTA for telling him straight.", "I think you are NTA. He asked and you answered. \n\nYou even tried it other ways, but he didn't get it. I would rather have my friend tell me, than everyone speaking behind my back. Even if it hurt at first, if he tries to change, it will help him. Not only with women, i think with friends and colleagues too.", "NTA.\n\n>He wouldn\u2019t take no for an answer and decuded to contact her himself to ask her out\n\nThis is alarming.\n\nThat being said, you tried the subtle approach and it didn\u2019t work. So your best bet was to keep it 100 with him. \n\n>He denied having bad hygiene, and said he does shower and brush his teeth\n\nHe's gotten so use to his bad habits and his smells that he refuse to believe that it's him. He won\u2019t better his hygiene so there really isn\u2019t any point anymore.

Stink fetish?\nIdk, idc.\n\nPersonally I was in slumps often. But after so many days I can\u2019t stand the feeling of skin and hair anymore. And my teeth hurt after 2 days without brushing them anyway.\n\nPlus: I paid enough money to fix holes in the past(which is also quite expensive in Switzerland) so that alone is reason enough to brush regularly.\n\nWell\u2026he might learn it eventually\u2026and maybe he apologises to you\u2026or not.\nI would certainly keep my distance if all helping him is answered this way\u2026.", "More info needed - how did you approach the conversation with your friend, and how exactly did you tell him his bad hygiene causes his loneliness?\n\nHonesty without tact is cruelty.

I don\u2019t think you\u2019re the A**hole. There can be reasons for poor hygiene such as being autistic, as sensory issues and other traits can make showering and brushing teeth difficult. You need to have a frank conversation about why they aren\u2019t looking after their hygiene.", "NTA.

You think he\u2019s great and has all the good qualities. Instead of saying gently that his hygiene needs some work you tell him he\u2019s disgusting. \n\nIs it disgusting if he smells and has bad breath...yes. Was it necessary to tell him he\u2019s disgusting? Absolutely not. I\u2019m probably going to get downvoted here, ESH. You for being brutal and him for having terrible hygiene in the first place.", "NTA - you tried to be subtle about this but that didnt work. Eventually he gave you no choice and you answered his question.", "NTA Though, I think you could have been a bit gentler mentioning it's possibly his special brand of odour/hygiene rather than telling him he's degusting.", "It\u2019s odd that you waited this long to say anything and that you handled it the way you did. \n\u201cBro, if you want to date her you need to shower daily, brush your teeth twice a day and do your laundry every week.\u201d \n\nI\u2019d apologize for your harsh delivery and I\u2019m going to say yta because you\u2019ve been smelling him for over 10 years and never told him.

It\u2019s a bit more expensive than regular deodorant but you may consider using it only when stressed lol (I know you didn\u2019t ask so sorry if this is unappreciated)", "Yea but it still wouldn\u2019t help the smell", "We lived about 50min from eachother so I never noticed until this one occasion. It was also towards the beginning of her health kick and going to the gym on a reg basis.", "I'd highly recommend it to anyone who is uncircumcised. Easier/less unpleasant than towel drying, especially if the fiber isn't super soft (YMMV re: sensitivity there), and more effective. Definitely cuts back much more on odor issues.", "They still get moisture trapped under their balls so a blow dryer on low is good for that area.", " Very helpful and thank you so much! \nIf I may ask, how much would a LASIK procedure like that cost? I\u2019m almost 99% certain I would not be able to afford it \ud83d\ude05\nI\u2019m also in the process of getting dental insurance via Delta Dental but have no idea what would be best for my specific case.", "Oh her BO? Yeah changing will help a little. It wouldn't get rid of it but you would smell less if you change into clean clothes."]}
