This could have a long lasting consequences for the entire family dynamic. Especially if step-son does not share the same feelings. Or what happens if they date & then break up... have to live together still... tough situation. Both these kids need to feel respected & protected in their own home. If your son feels more comfortable at his dad\u2019s house then he should have that option, if it\u2019s a suitable situation. Family counseling would probably be helpful regardless of where your son lives. Tough situation.\n\nNAH", "Why is everyone looking at this purely as homophobia, I could be completely wrong but is this not just the awkwardness and complications of two (essentially) brothers actually being in love. I'm aware they aren't blood related and from the son's perspective its just a random boy entering his life, but from every other perspective they're brothers and an intimate relationship within family is off limits. \n\nI only think OP is the asshole (unless it is homophobia) if you send him away without talking it out and trying to make it work and explain why there is mixed feelings about it.", "A lot of people seem to be conflating her discomfort with the situation with being anti-gay and it's not coming across that way in the description.  Imagine the same thing with your stepson and your bio-daughter if one of them said they wanted to have sex with the other one. How are you going to \"work it out\" if one of your children declares they are sexually attracted to another of your children? Physical separation is a practical solution to the immediate issue.\n\nMy only hesitancy is that I can't see a 16-year-old gay male blurting out that he wants to have sex with this stepbrother.  It's really hard to believe that he would choose to make that public. This smells like a troll.", "People talking about reasonable boundaries have never been teenagers? Having two teens with feelings for each other living together is a whole ordeal, honestly people expect two teenagers to control themselves?\n\nWhat would happen if/when they break up? You will have a mess.\n\nNTA, this is something that requires a lot of careful thinking and sending one of them away seems reasonable.", "I\u2019m unclear - are both boys interested in each other? Or is this a one sided thing?", "Simply a thought...Is it possible she's trying to prevent them from having intercourse in the home? As in, you wouldn't let an underaged couple simply live together unattended to, possibly having irresponsible sexual experiences under your roof. I wouldn't let my teenage daughter live with her bf/gf as a young teen. Wondering if maybe this could possibly have been more of why she reacted that way.", "INFO: Did you know your son was attracted to boys before this?", "NTa.  I would not want my son to date his step sibling.  It would be too messy.", "YTA. You know how your son will take this right?? He comes out and you immediately send him to live with his father. Yikes.", ">I think it would be best if my son lived with his father for a while.\n\nINFO: Why?", "They can date once they\u2019re over 18 and no longer live with their wedded parents. NTA.", "NTA.

Talk to them. Set *reasonable* boundaries. Maybe see a family counselor to discuss how to proceed, because I guarantee things like this have happened before and that people have reacted better than you are now.", "So your kids never met before you got married...? I could see there being a lot of concern about this if the boys had grown up together, but from what I'm understanding they haven't and are basically roommates to each other, so it's not surprising they might develop crushes. IMO YWBTA because from your post it sounds like you just want to ship your son off to avoid having difficult conversations and make the whole situation just disappear, which is seriously wrong. You need to have a sit down discussion with both boys and stepdad about how this shifts dynamics in the house and that new rules will have to be established. Probably go to a family councilor to deal with this. Your son will most likely feel disowned/shamed if you send him away", "Why is it that your son has to go but his son gets to stay? Imagine your husband's reaction to you telling him his son needs to go live with his mother because of this. He'd be rightfully furious with the image that you're playing favorites. I understand your concerns and regardless of people calling homophobia or not, you can't just send your kid away like that and not expect him to have some sort of extreme resentment towards you. YWBTA if you send your kid away without having a talk with everyone who's involved to get your concerns out there and try to find a reasonable solution.", "NTA? But also could be YTA?\n\nAs far as I\u2019m concerned, it completely depends on what your motive is and how you communicate the choice with your son. It\u2019s beyond reasonable to not want them living in the same house if they want to explore those feelings, that could become a bad situation very fast regardless of gender. If you want to send him away in some strange punishment for liking his \u201cbrother\u201d that he definitely doesn\u2019t see as a brother, than that\u2019s walking into AH territory. \n\nYou definitely need to have a bigger talk with your husband, two sons and your ex about what the expectations of these feelings are and how to explore it.", "I don't think she's abandoning her son. It seems like the attraction is mutual and controlling those feelings and urges at 16 is hard enough when you're NOT sharing a house, possibly a bedroom with the object of your affection. Moving him to his father's is one way to give them space and time to work out their feelings, decide if they want to try dating and then possibly actually doing so. It also presents the bonus that one of them can't sneak into the other's bed in the middle of the night for a little teenage coitus. You don't want your kid banging you new husband's kid regardless of the genders involved. Young love is crazy, teenagers are all starry eyes and raging hormones. Also, we don't know... but what if the other boy can't go elsewhere because he doesn't have elsewhere to go? His mom could be deceased, or unfit, or out of state, or just not be involved with her kids. It might be that the only reasonable way to separate these potential lovers is to send her son to his father. Hopefully just across town.\n\nI'm not sure I have the information I would need to make a decision on this, mostly because as a mom to a bi curious son and a gender-fluid AMAB child I can only see this from how I could protect the hearts of my adopted children.", "YTA your son did a difficult thing by being upfront and truthful about his mutual feelings for your husband's son. You didn't attempt to figure out a living situation with agreed upon boundaries and instead shipped him off to his dad's house.", "YTA I understand your thought process behind sending him to his fathers, but it seems a little harsh. Would it be possible to explore different solutions before removing him from the household?", "YTA. Could it be awkward? -Sure.\n\nIs that a reason to send your son away? -No.", "I am really shocked by all of the YTA for the assumed homophobia.  I doubt it'd be a good idea for step brothers to date, correct?  Things would get awkward either way.  It's crappy that OP didn't hear her son out before being scared into thinking of sending him away.  Hope it's not due to homophobia....ESH for the whole situation", "YTA. The boys had something deeply personal to share with you. Your first instinct is to send your son away??? Matter of fact, why send YOUR son away? Why not send your stepson to HIS mom? Sending either of them to live somewhere else just tells them that you don't want them. You either show your son that you choose your husband's children over him, or you show your stepson that you don't want him as part of your family.\n\nYes, they boys shouldn't \"be together\" because the situation has the potential to blow up badly if they fall out. But sending one away is NOT the answer. They are old enough to have a mature conversations about that, and to have boundaries while they live in your house. When they turn 18, they can get jobs and their own apartment, and you can mind your own business, but it's just not ok for them to couple up while living in your house - the same as if your son and your husband's daughter had a crush on each other. Therapy may be a good idea.\n\nExile is not.", "YTA for wanting to ABANDON, give up and not wanting to \"deal\" with the vulnerability, honesty and the feelings of your son.  \nTry talking with (not at) your son and spending time with him to find out who he really is. You may be surprised. Shame on you!!! Your behavior is DISGUSTING!", "YTA\n\nSo how does your husband's son feel about your son?  I think he may feel the same way by how you write the post.  \n\nDoes your husband know his son might like boys (he might also like girls and/or be non binary - same for your son).\n\nRealistically if you are so homophobic then your son perhaps should live with his dad if his dad is more tolerant.\n\nBut if you want to send him to his dad's because you are worried that your husband's homophobia will be taken out on your son then I'll change my stance.  Could that be that the boys came to you because they are worried about how your husband might react and you might be the person stopping him losing it completely.\n\nReality is that even if you send your son away to live somewhere else... if the two boys like each other then it's not going to stop a relationship but you will have no idea what is happening because neither of them will trust you.", "YTA, I don\u2019t think this is an appropriate response to your son coming out. If you send him away, he\u2019s going to develop resentment around his sexuality, and possibly develop abandonment issues.\n\nI think the best way to approach this is sit both sons down, and say it\u2019s inappropriate for them to be together because right now they are brothers in the same house. \n\nSending him away would cause irreparable damage to your relationship with him.", "YTA.  Your son just came out to you and your reaction is to send him away? What kind of parent are you! So he likes his stepbrother,  how does the stepbrother feel? Because he is the only other one that matters here. If you send your son to his father's you will likely lose his trust forever.", "YTA\n\nThey aren't biologically related and they haven't been raised that way since infants. They were honest with you and you should be grateful they felt comfy enough to tell you. Sounds like a happy surprise in your little family there and for no reason at all you think you should just remove him from it. \n\n\nShould he be able to say that since he likes the other son that you should send away your husband because your relationship isn't as important as his? Because that's what you're doing and it's incredibly selfish.", "YTA. I\u2019m going to give you the benefit of the doubt that your feelings aren\u2019t based on homophobia but rather your fear of the impact a romantic relationship between your son and stepson could have on your family if things don\u2019t work out. With that said, sending your son to live with his father is not an appropriate solution. What you should do is work with a family therapist, preferably one that specializes in LGBTQ youth and their families, and figure out how to support the boys while also keeping the family unit in tact. The therapist will most likely tell you to let the boys have a relationship but make it clear that their relationship drama will not become family drama so they shouldn\u2019t expect anyone to take sides if it doesn\u2019t work out.", "Definitely YTA. Your son trusted you to tell you his feelings and you want to send him away for it. \nIf said everything that I want to say to you, I would get banned, grrr.", "YTA and a horrible mother.", "They\u2019re not related?

If not, YTA.", "YTA you just need to set some rules down not send him away,", "YTA - a discussion about about this with the three of you (and if they\u2019re comfortable with your husband as well) is very much needed.\n\nWhat would sending him away actually do to their relationship? It would severely damage your relationship with both your son and step son, and they would stay in contact while your son is with his father. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s very much you can do here, but establish boundaries in the family structure and acknowledge that this is\u2026 gonna be hard to understand outside looking in.", "Don't worry he won't get pregnant.", "YTA - Yes it's a bit awkward and weird. But shipping him off is not the answer. Sit down. Talk to them. Get them therapy to explore these feelings and what they implicate to the family setting. \n\nEven if he lives with his Dad, they'll make it work. They'll long distance then as soon as they're 18  they'll move out and be together anyway. The only difference is you'll never see them again.", "YTA you homophobic freak", "Does your husband know? \n\nKicking your son (or either boy) out to live elsewhere seems very extreme and I\u2019m wondering why you\u2019d jump to something like that. \n\nIt probably does need to be addressed though, because living with someone you have romantic feelings for at 16 years of age could escalate quickly end badly.\n\nIf this is how your son came out to you, please don\u2019t send him away or he\u2019ll think you are unsupportive. Hopefully that\u2019s not the case. If you already knew he was gay, then you\u2019re solely dealing with how to help him navigate the feelings he has for someone he\u2019s going to be living with. \n\nThere\u2019s no reason why he can\u2019t become romantically involved with this boy - they\u2019re not brothers and at this age they\u2019ll never share that kind of bond.  But I would talk with them both (assuming this is mutual) about a worst case scenario. The best I would hope for as a parent is that things don\u2019t progress until they\u2019re old enough to move out because once they break up (as is very likely considering how young they are) things are going to be very awkward very fast.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I was very close to him, and he will always be my grandfather, despite the fact we aren't related. Their son and I never got along, so he is not my uncle but my father's much younger half-brother. He's not my anything. I'm pretty sure he just calls me 'brat'. Since my grandfather's passing, I have had no contact or knowledge of him. You define family ties as you want to. \n\n\nKicking one half of a pair out means the remaining partner is still living there, and will likely be pissed at OP. They will know why they are being separated. So, instead of possibly managing relationship fallout, OP will be the evil stepmother right off the bat. That sounds like it will create a very tense household, especially if the stepson is close to his sister and she starts picking up the evil stepmother vibes.", "Sending her son away is the best way to guarantee resentments all around. Her son will resent getting kicked out because he came to her to share something personal, especially right as she is leaving to go live with her new family. Her stepson will resent the son being sent away too, and will know the reason is because they are attracted  to each other. OP will still have to live with him, and she just became the new evil stepmother. If the stepson is close with his sister, she may pick up the resentment and start disliking OP too. That doesn't sound like a great home. If the new husband's home life is suddenly full of kids vs stepmom arguments, fights, and stress, then it will cause more arguments, fights, and stress. Plus, in this age of smartphones, email, and social media, sending her own son away is unlikely to end the relationship anyway. \n\n\nIn addition, the best way to fan teenage flames is by opposing them. Now, they would know to keep things secret from OP, and that can cause resentment, too. At 16, those early relationships feel like everything in the moment. Telling them it won't last is counterproductive. They might cling on longer than they should just to prove you wrong. And any talk about why they shouldn't be together sounds like it would be started with 'I called dibs on his dad first'. Not a great argument.\n\n\nLaying out the same ground rules they might have for a visiting 'friend', like doors must stay open and limit PDAs is an option. Giving them a safe sex talk and letting them go at it is an option, especially since pregnancy isn't a problem. Sitting them down and telling them that you expect them to be respectful and be gracious towards each other as long as they live in your house is a must. Forcibly separating them *after* the relationship ends if needed is an option. Then OP would be fixing a problem rather than punishing her son to possibly prevent one. Let it play out, and be ready to pick up the pieces.", "If it makes stepson uncomfortable, that's a whole other reason why a change of scenery for a bit might be for the best!\n\nBoth parents should talk to their respective children, separately and in a safe environment/situation.", "This may not have been him coming out, this may just be him revealing his interest in the other boy.  Coming out may have happened before this.  Need more info.  I could see the same situation playing out with opposite sex.", "So you would be okay with two kids(take out the gender) in your house non related but step siblings having feelings for each other and potentially getting physical? \nI don't think sending him away immediately is the right answer but boundaries definitely need to be set.

I was about to get snarky.", "It's still him expressing interest in a boy, and then getting immediately shipped off. Mom needs to find a different solution here otherwise she is going to irreparably damage her relationship with her child.", "uh what??

They\u2019re not going to care that two teenagers are dating each other.", "Yeah, i thought it would be obvious but I saw some of the comments her and figured it might be better.", "Would you feel the same if it was a boy/girl?", "Yes?", "I wouldn\u2019t, I wouldn\u2019t ban the relationship or try to stop it.  I would adjust the living arrangements.  Maybe the father will get a closer bond with his son out it anyway.  There is a lot of questions here, what\u2019s going on with the current living arrangements, did the son request to live full time with the mom?  How much time does the son live with the dad?  Do both parents live near each other and will a change of schools happen if the living arrangements change?  Just a few of the many from this post.", "Are they dating? \n\n>I didn't know what to say, and then I saw my husband's son standing around tte corner listening, they'd agreed that my son would be the one to tell me.\n\nThis is a little ambiguous so I can't tell. If they are dating or it's mutual, you know that moving your son isn't necessarily going to stop them from dating if they want to do that. It might encourage it. Have you considered that if it's mutual? Like a rebellion thing. \n\nIf your son likes the other kid and it's not mutual, moving out for a bit might be for the best for your son but not long term. \n\nLong term, what are thinking here? Your son is only allowed at your house under strict supervision? Are they going to go to the same school? Where is the dad? Does his dad know he is bisexual? If so, is he fine with it? I can't judge this without that last info.", "NAH. This is a complicated situation and there\u2019s not a sure fire solution. This is a kind of a dumb comparison to draw but it kind of reminds me of the George Michael/Maebe storyline from arrested development. It\u2019s played for comedy throughout the show, but it points out some real potential issues like showering in close proximity, assumptions that it\u2019s fine to share a bedroom, or someone falls and lands on top of the other person. \n\nYou need to figure out what to do in collaboration with your son, but I don\u2019t think your instinct is wrong.", "Honestly OP, just rollback the move-in until this is sorted. It's the cleanest NTA solution.", "NAH\n\nThis situation is very complicated and I understand why you thought of having your son live with his dad. Rather than make decisions on your own, I would discuss it with your husband and make the decision together. Personally, I would let the sons have some input, but truthfully the decision is on you guys together and I think jumping the gun to send your son away is an understandable knee-jerk reaction (I.e. separating the two), but you should hold your horses and calm down first before making any moves.", "NAH\n\nTricky situation but I\u2019d probably try to find a less dramatic solution first. Presumably there is a reason your son lives with you and he probably doesn\u2019t want to be thrown from his home & routine. \n\nBut even more important, I think you really want to send the message that telling you was the right thing to do. If you end up sending him away you\u2019ll be teaching your kid not to disclose stuff to you and that\u2019s a much worse situation.\n\nI think you need to sit down with both kids & parents and come up with boundaries and rules for how to navigate this. Maybe going away to his dad can be a backup plan if the rules are not followed.", "My widowed father is currently dating my widowed mother-in-law. There\u2019s a non-zero chance that my husband of 30 years and I may become step siblings. These things happen; it is not incestuous.

So you knew he was bisexual, and there's mutual feeling between the boys. You also don't think it's a good idea for step-siblings to date. This is a tricky situation, and I agree it's probably not the best for them to date. But you can't just ship your son off and hide the problem. You need to sit down as a family and discuss this, namely that if the relationship doesn't work out, it will cause strife in your family. The kids are teens, hormones will be running wild... It could cause all sorts of issues. I think you need to sit down with the boys and talk about this.

You will have no peace of mind as long as the relationship is going on, because it's just going to feel too weird and awkward for the whole family.\n\nOn top of that, it's just a matter of time before their relationship blows up and ends. Then you'll have to deal with all kinds of drama related to the break-up, which is going to disrupt your daily lives much worse than a break-up with an outsider. You'll have to deal with all the unpleasantness and emotional fallout for each boy, trying hard not to choose sides, while still trying to hold down your jobs and somehow function in daily life. \n\nAt that point, one boy will have to move to another household, anyway.

I would be concerned about my 16 year old living with a romantic interest regardless of the relationship. So I understand the inclination to separate them.

Ultimately it is your decision but I do think you\u2019d be a big AH for this. You need to address this and not avoid it, as sending him off could mean the end of your relationship. Be open about your feelings, let him be open about his. Let the fathers into the discussion as well, and make sure this is discussed in detail.
