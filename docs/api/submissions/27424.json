He also made it clear he also meant my partner (F26) included on the two week trip.  We make significantly less money than my folks and my partner got a new job so to make this happen they had to take unpaid leave.  It seemed very important to them and we knew it would be stressful due to previous interactions but decided to be team players.\n\nAnyway, the second day of the trip we were sitting on the porch and my brother (34) and sister in law (29) brought us a bottle of wine from the country they live in.  We had previously decided to not drink around my folks cause things tend to escalate but everyone seemed chill so we had a glass of wine with everyone.\n\nMy brother and Dad started talking about politics, and my dad brought up Amy Klochubar, the Senator that got caught yelling and throwing a stapler at a staff member.  My dad was ranting about how she got disqualified for bullshit, my partner chimed in saying, it\u2019s never ok to yell at people.  My dad then stood up, started pointing at her yelling, \u201cyou don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about, you\u2019ve never been in a management position.\u201d  At which point, I stood up, separated him from my partner and asked if she was ok, she said no, and went to our room.

You stood up for your wife and your father is dead wrong. Ive been a manager for 10 years. I have NEVER yelled at my employees.i have the lowest turn over rate in my district. I also have the highest sales. There are stores that should be absolutely doubling what we make but they don't... why? Because customers come back to a place that has happy people working. And employees show up to work for bosses that don't suck. I literally had to tell my new hire that she looked like garbage today and if she's still sick tomorrow we will make it work and get her paid (sick pay). You were right to defend your wife and your dad was probably a terrible manager.", "NTA your dad is a bully and your family enable him for whatever reason but it's not ok and ty for standing up for your partner", "NTA - Your Dad ruined his own birthday. He's probably thrown something at an employee in his past.", "NTA.\nYou didn't ruin anything; your father did when he decided to yell at your partner and refuse to respect her boundaries. You did exactly what you should have. You stood by her and listened to her needs. You didn't force her to speak to someone she didn't want to and you removed both of you from a toxic, stressful situation.", "NTA Your family has a lot of their own work to do and it is not your job to sugar coat things to protect them. You didn't mention a pattern of behavior but I would not be surprised if this was more the straw that broke the camel's back than a one time event, due to their actions after the fact. Your dad claiming to be triggered in an attempt to avoid accountability is a selfish disgusting move. Your mom guilt-tripping you, because they do not want to put in the work to change, is telling you to get back in line where you always were, and it would make sense if you \"rocking the boat\" was your partner's fault in their eyes. You should check out the Don't Rock the Boat essay sometime and see if it resonates with you. You are in a hard spot, but it won't actually be easier to give in and go back to placate. I truly wish you the best of luck on your healing journey wherever that takes you.", "NTA. Sounds like you may have people best avoided when drinking in your family. No contact sounds like a great option if you don't want to be yelled at for saying it's never okay to yell at people.", "NTA. Your father ruined his own birthday. You were right to leave. He escalated that way too fast, then wanted to escalate it further.  Time to take a break from that toxicity.", "NTA - dad has everyone wrapped around his finger huh?", "NTA. Sounds like your family can't handle alcohol. Even Wine which I in my 65 years of living never seen anybody get mean drinking it. Your whole family maybe stay drinking soft drinks. He your dad and family should apologize, until then stay LC.", "NTA. You didn't ruin a damn thing. Your dad did that by himself. Major respect from this lady, for standing by your girl, in the moment, when it mattered. Your dad needs to understand he isn't the leading expert on shit. Your girlfriend was right. It is not okay to scream, yell or throw things. Your dad needs to grow up and the rest of your family needs to stop enabling his ridiculous antics.", "NTA\n\nI think that NC would be an appropriate decision in this case.  I don't see any benefit in continuing a relationship with any of these people.", "NTA at all.  Your dad and the rest of your family bullied your partner. Good for you for having her back and getting out of that situation.", "NTA\n\nYou did the right thing\n\nThe so called adult man you unfortunately call your father ruined his own birthday \n\nYour dad is abusive and seems like an alcoholic on top of that\n\nHe was verbally abusing your wife right in front of you and you did everything right: you got in between your bully of a father and your wife, defended and had her back when your family ganged up on her\n\nYou are an amazing husband and don\u2019t doubt that you did the right thing \n\nGoing no contact until they apologized is the only way to spare your wife from being ganged up and harassed by your father\u2019s flying monkeys \n\nStand by that decision and protect your wife from your family\u2019s bs", "Lol freaking Amy Klobuchar. Of all the random ass things. NTA. Your dad has serious anger issues and your family seems to enable it.", "NTA\nGood on you! All around, you did everything right.\nYour dad is the one who ruined his own birthday.\n\n You gave it a try, stood up for your partner when your dad behaved horribly & removed yourselves from the situation when it was obvious the whole family was going to continue the abuse.\n\nNC, until he offers an apology, is a good call. And no more family trips. Ever. If he can only be on good behavior in short stretches of time, then that's all he should be allowed (after an apology, obviously).", "NTA, and disqualified from what? She's the 7th most popular Senator (+25 approve over disapprove in her home state), and she was on national news yesterday. She dropped out of the presidential race the day before Super Tuesday; that's not being 'disqualified', that's choosing to bow out", "You didn\u2019t ruin his birthday.  He did.", "Nta you didn't ruin anything, your dad did", "They have a somewhat traumatic background that my parents are aware of, this isn\u2019t the first time he\u2019s yelled at her, I told him that this isn\u2019t acceptable behavior the first time.", "Over something stupid too. Being a manager doesn\u2019t mean you can yell at employees - like he\u2019s just straight up wrong. But throwing something like a stapler at an employee is NEVER acceptable and definitely not small \u201cbullshit\u201d that any employer will over look. \n\nNTA. Sounds like leaving when your family starts drinking is going to be your new protocol, at best.", "To save you a search [Don't Rock the Boat Essay](https://reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/s/1metBARMLb)", "That makes it even worse that they\u2019re aware of her background. Definitely continue no contact, I\u2019m sorry your dad is being like this. He\u2019s going to ruin his relationships by treating people like this.", "OPs partner seems to go by They/Them, OP has only used those pronouns in reference to them (despite putting an F instead of NB next to age).", "OP uses she/her pronouns as well several times in their post! Possibly OP\u2019s partner uses she/they pronouns?"]}
