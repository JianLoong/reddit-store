I *do* want to get married and have kids eventually, but not now. Not when I\u2019m still so young, still figuring out who I am and what my place in the world is; I am nowhere near ready to be a wife, let alone a mother to another human being entirely dependent on me. When I try to communicate these feelings to my mum, her response is always along the lines of \u201cI won\u2019t be here forever, I want to see you settled and to meet my grandkids before I go.\u201d This ends up making me feel selfish, guilty, and as though I\u2019m letting her down somehow.\n\nMy mum often tries to take things into her own hands by introducing me to her friend\u2019s sons, or by trying to make me sign up to various dating apps etc. My last straw was this week:\n\nI\u2019m currently doing a Masters degree and one of my professors is the same ethnic background as me - we\u2019re both Arab. I found this super exciting because the uni I\u2019m studying at is not very ethnically diverse, especially in terms of staff, and so having an Arab professor who specialises in the field(s) that I\u2019m interested in was so cool to me and I of course immediately told my mum about it. As an immigrant who isn\u2019t used to representation in academic spaces, she also found it super exciting and was very proud that I was being taught by him.

Pushing you towards marriage and kids you are not ready to fulfill her fantasy of you married and grandkids is selfish of her. What would she do if you and/or you possible future husband struggled with fertility? What would happen if you were gay/lesbian and wanted to marry a woman?", "NTA  Mom needs to stay in her lane. You have every right to be irritated.  I hope she's not the type to go behind your back and email this guy trying to set something up.  As a professor, his contact information is going to be available on the university's website, so you may want to give him a warning.\n\nFirst, it would be completely inappropriate for a professor and his student to have a relationship, and your mom needs to understand that.  \n\nSecond, laws of attraction. She can't force an attraction between 2 people. It's one thing to introduce you to others, but then she needs to back off.\n\nThird,  you said you're not ready for a relationship. Period.\n\n And the whole 'I won't be here forever.' That's so manipulative.  No one is given forever. I could get hit by a bus this afternoon!", "You're not overreacting. As someone with a similar mom, the countless self-crusades this woman has decided to put herself on is exhausting. \n\nAnd it will never end. You will meet someone, and she will push marriage, then kids, then more kids and so on. \n\nEven though I have sat my mom down several times to speak to her about her pushy and aggressive nature, she still on occasion brings up the next steps in my relationship. \n\nGood luck, NTA.", "NTA \n\nEw, students dating profs is so gross (at least in modern Western culture), bc so often it\u2019s about abuse of the student by the prof. Have you told your mother above that?", "NTA. \n\nYour mother is a typical example of what toxic parents do, ie guilt tripping you to get what she wants. \n\nShe doesn\u2019t respect you or your ability to make your own decisions and you have done ABSOLUTELY the right thing by expressing your boundary to her. \n\nAt the extreme end, people have low contact with toxic parents for a reason!", "I think you need to take a break from your relationship with your mother.

Sorry you're dealing with this!\n\nNot because I think it would work in your case, but just because it's a funny story I never get to tell, and it's a similar situation:\n\nOne of my neighbors, her daughter was 26, at the time which, here, in modern times is barely out of college, practically still a child... but where my neighbor is from, being 26 and unmarried, well you're already a spinster or something, lol.\n\nAnyway the 26 year old came over one day (I wasn't there, they separately told me about it later, both venting) and says like,\n\n\"Mom, I really want to get married asap! But I have a problem and I need your help!\"\n\nAnd ofc, this is mom's dream, right? So she's super excited to fix *whatever it is* and help her daughter hurry up and *get a man*.\n\nSo her daughter goes \"my friends keep trying to set me up on dates, and it gives me really bad anxiety. So bad that I can't go on the dates! And then the anxiety is so bad, I don't even want to get married, sometimes I feel like that for *weeks*!\" then before her mom can open her mouth to reply daughter says \"how do I tell them to stop setting me up so I can start dating?!\"\n\nShe's figuring, of course, whatever mom says to tell her friends, she can tell that to her mom instead, and mom will get the point.\n\nAnd then her mom says,\n\n\"Tell them your mother will be finding your husband, so they can stay out of it!\"\n\nAnd of course at this point, daughter's plans are dust, and mother has obviously won, right?\n\nBut daughter gets real for a minute and says \"but mom, I get that anxiety *more* when it's you setting the dates up!\"\n\nWhich I thought was brilliant. But her mom immediately launches into \"I? I give you anxiety? I who am your mother? Who has always been there for you? I?\" and goes all melodramatic, can't believe what a disrespectful child, on and on.\n\nThey are both certain the other is unreasonable, and like to complain about the conversation to anyone who will listen.\n\nWhen mom tells the story she swears that she could *see* the malice in her daughter's eyes, she was trying to send her to an early grave and so on.\n\nDaughter tells it now and laughs, but she used to be so very sad and frustrated.\n\nShe's 29 now, and happily engaged, (to a guy she met on a dating app!) and has a baby on the way a few months after the wedding, though her mother doesn't know she's pregnant yet, lol. \n\nMother and daughter are both happy, for now. \n\nAnyway, best of luck, hopefully you find a way to stop your mom's meddling in your love life, without damaging the relationship <3", "NTA. And you are very justified in your anger, pretty soon you're going to be adding resentment. Actions like this are what lead to LC or NC situations.

So, you're not over reacting. You need to have a serious sit down with your mother so you can discuss with her how this leaves you feling. She'll either understand because she's your mother and she loves you, or she won't because her beliefs are more important to her than your feelings.
