But I have a problem and I need your help!\"\n\nAnd ofc, this is mom's dream, right? So she's super excited to fix *whatever it is* and help her daughter hurry up and *get a man*.\n\nSo her daughter goes \"my friends keep trying to set me up on dates, and it gives me really bad anxiety. So bad that I can't go on the dates! And then the anxiety is so bad, I don't even want to get married, sometimes I feel like that for *weeks*!\" then before her mom can open her mouth to reply daughter says \"how do I tell them to stop setting me up so I can start dating?!\"\n\nShe's figuring, of course, whatever mom says to tell her friends, she can tell that to her mom instead, and mom will get the point.\n\nAnd then her mom says,\n\n\"Tell them your mother will be finding your husband, so they can stay out of it!\"\n\nAnd of course at this point, daughter's plans are dust, and mother has obviously won, right?\n\nBut daughter gets real for a minute and says \"but mom, I get that anxiety *more* when it's you setting the dates up!\"\n\nWhich I thought was brilliant. But her mom immediately launches into \"I? I give you anxiety? I who am your mother? Who has always been there for you? I?\" and goes all melodramatic, can't believe what a disrespectful child, on and on.\n\nThey are both certain the other is unreasonable, and like to complain about the conversation to anyone who will listen.\n\nWhen mom tells the story she swears that she could *see* the malice in her daughter's eyes, she was trying to send her to an early grave and so on.\n\nDaughter tells it now and laughs, but she used to be so very sad and frustrated.\n\nShe's 29 now, and happily engaged, (to a guy she met on a dating app!) and has a baby on the way a few months after the wedding, though her mother doesn't know she's pregnant yet, lol. \n\nMother and daughter are both happy, for now. \n\nAnyway, best of luck, hopefully you find a way to stop your mom's meddling in your love life, without damaging the relationship <3", "NTA.

Tell your mom that you love her, but she\u2019s damaging your relationship by trying to pressure you into marriage. Tell her the topic is closed. If she brings it up, hang up, leave, etc. until she gets the message and backs off.", "> This ends up making me feel selfish, guilty\u2026\n\n*She* is the selfish one and *she* should feel guilty for guilt tripping you about life changing decisions that are not her business.\n\nNTA", "Can we also talk about the fact that dating a professor is a huge code violation at many schools, and cause him to get fired and you to be expelled? \n\nEven if you were interested in him, he was interested in you, and everything was perfect, it\u2019s unlikely that he would be willing to risk his career.\n\nYour mother meddling could still create some risks to his job.", "Op needs to put her mom on a timeout and info diet. If you don't want to cut her off, tell her you won't be talking about your love life anymore.

Why is it so hard to fathom that this isn\u2019t 1955, you have other priorities and goals for your life that don\u2019t include men AND you have PLENTY OF TIME to meet someone!", "NTA. She\u2019s guilt tripping you for not doing things on her schedule. You\u2019ve asked her to stop but she hasn\u2019t. Sounds like you need to set some firm boundaries here. \u201cMom, I love you and I know your heart is in the right place, but I need you to stop pressuring me to get married and have kids when I\u2019m not ready.

Ask who she is dating and when she\u2019s getting married and why hasn\u2019t she provided you siblings yet. \n\nAlso, leave your professor alone - dating you would be a violation of everything he is supposed to stand for as a teacher and might get him fired. \n\nNTA", "NTA.

On top of that, people may well lose respect for you too if they thought you\u2019d slept your way to a good grade. You\u2019re NTA for being adamant about saying no. If she keeps pressuring you, maybe mention (if you haven\u2019t already) that a relationship between you and your professor would be a detriment to both of you as working professionals anywhere near academia.

It is very good of you to not want to get involved with your professor; however, depending on how desperate your mom is, you may want to have a frank talk with him about it.

Does your mother's rush to get you married and pregnant, even to your teacher, stem from her wanting to look for a man herself, or is it still the conditioning that women must have husbands and babies to be validated?", "NTA Her intentions aren't pure they're bathed in misogyny in that somehow you a soon to be highly educated woman just can't possibly live your life without a husband to support you.

Have you considered introducing her to community activities or women's groups that could take up a chunk of her time and stop her from obsessing over what you do with your life? It might get her off your case a little bit. NTA", "NTA and it is past time to put your mother on an information diet. Tell her that if she continues to try and pressure you (because lets face it, your mother has grandbaby fever and you are her only way to get them), you'll be going low contact. If she continues to try and pressure you, you'll put her in time out for a week and then each time in the same conversation, add another week where you won't be contacting her at all. And reinforce the point by saying that you won't invite her to your wedding when it happens or let her know your children because she keeps pushing you into something that you are not ready for. Tell her you know it is coming from a place of love and concern, but it is causing more harm to her relationship with you than she realises."]}
