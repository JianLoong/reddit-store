Cass is with my ex wife and Mark is with my wife. Cass lives with my ex and is long distance (ex moved) and I only see her once every other month. Mark lives with me and my wife full time.\n\nI will admit I struggle with a lot of guilt when it comes to Cass because of the distance, so when Cass wants something I try to do all I can to make it happen. Cass is also extremely sensitive so I have to handle her very carefully as not to upset her.\n\nMark, on the other hand, is more out there, will try to argue back, and I tend to be a bit harder on him because he's got a stronger personality.\n\nAbout a month ago Cass called saying she broke her brand new iPhone I'd given her as an early birthday present and asked me to pay to get it fixed for her. Since I rarely get the chance to do stuff for Cass, I said yes, sent her the money and reassured her that I'm not mad, it was an accident, but please be more careful with her devices.\n\nA week later, Mark broke his iPad he's had for over 2 years. Mark is rough on his stuff and a bit on the clumsy side. I told Mark it's his fault for not paying more attention and its going to be a while until his iPad is going to be fixed and the money is going to come out of his allowance and I hope it teaches him to be more responsible. Mark started arguing with me and I ended up grounding him for 2 weeks, but really only followed through on the first week.\n\nNow my wife is mad at me, saying the way I reacted to Mark was unfair compared to the way I reacted to Cass. That I was forgiving and understanding to my daughter, who's older, but not my son, who's much younger. I tried to explain it as I don't see Cass much or get a chance to do as much for her, so anytime I can, I'm going to. Where I see and do stuff with Mark every day, so it's a different situation and I handled each as they needed to be handled.  My wife still insists I dropped the ball on the way I dealt with Mark and said I should have treated him the same way I did Cass and brought up the fact Cass broke her brand new iPhone only a month after getting it, while Mark had his iPad over 2 years before anything went wrong.\n\nTold to add this: Cass phone was broken when she asked her friend to toss it to her and she accidentally dropped her phone while trying to catch it. Mark wore out the charge port on his iPad, possibly due to mishandling it. Mark also has motorskill delays.", "created_utc": 1670342858, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zeairj/aita_for_punishing_my_son_when_my_daughter_did/", "score": 2291, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

That\u2019s why it\u2019s broken.\n\n2) your son\u2019s 2YO iPad charging port is messed up. He did nothing to it, it wore out through normal use. \n\nYTA\n\nParenting out of guilt does kids no favors. And being over the top over stupid shit doesn\u2019t either. You handled both situations quite poorly.", "Obviously, YTA. You can't expect an 8 yo to be more responsible/careful than a 17 yo. What's your goal here, to raise two responsible kids who appreciate the value of a dollar, or to buy your daughter's affection out of guilt?\n\nI'm not saying you're wrong for getting her phone fixed, but you are wrong for holding your son to a higher standard than your daughter. You're basically showing them both that you have low expectations for her. It's hard enough for girls to achieve at the same level as boys without the adults in their lives doubting what they're capable of. I say this as a retired teacher who saw it over and over again.\n\nETA: I'm not saying you should treat both of them exactly the same. They're two different people. Yes, you should consider their ages, personalities, individual needs, etc. Just maintain the same high standards and expectations for both.", "YTA your son managed to hang onto that iPad for 2 years and yet you claim he is rough on his stuff and doesn\u2019t take care. Your daughter broke her new phone is a matter of months?! You may be acting out of guilt towards your daughter but you shouldn\u2019t take it out on your son. Also, do you require both kids to keep their items in protective cases? My daughter has an old iPad of mine that we put in an otter box. She is 6 yo and it is still in perfect shape. All devices should be in protective cases (until the children buy their own).", "YTA, and that was *before* your little \u201coops, forgot to mention she *told* her friend to throw it and he just had a charge port issue; that doesn\u2019t matter, does it?\u201d stunt in the comments.\n\n> I don't see Cass much or get a chance to do as much for her\n\nWhat does that have to do with how reasonable it is to expect a 17 year old to demonstrate more responsibility with a brand-new, expensive possession compared to an 8 year old?  If it was an accident and no harm done in her case, then the same should apply to Mark.  If you think *he* needs to learn not to let it happen again, then so should she, especially when she should actually have some means of being able to pay her share of the repairs.", "YTA and your wife is correct, listen to her", "YTA\n\nSo much YTA\n\nYou treat your elder daughter reasonably, but you treat your younger son like that? Yuck. He\u2019s going to end up resenting you and his sister. You\u2019re not teaching him anything except that you\u2019ll treat him like shit because of some misplaced guilt.", "> so when Cass wants something I try to do all I can to make it happen. Cass is also extremely sensitive so I have to handle her very carefully as not to upset her.\n\nDo you honestly not see a connection between these two statements?\n\nYou've spoiled your daughter through your lack of parenting and created a monster who easily manipulates you.\n\nYour 8 year old son broke an iPad after TWO YEARS OF USE and you punished him. Your wife is dead right about the double standard.\n\nYTA", "YTA and you know it. You treat your kids differently because you feel guilty. Come on\u2026a 17 year old broke her brand new iPhone and you fixed it right away. Your 8 year old broke his 2-year-old iPad and you punished him hard for it. You\u2019re acting like a bad parent to both kids.", "YTA\n\nI understand that you see it as spending money on her because you can't spend the time, but look at it from the 8 year old's POV:\n\nHe is being held to a higher standard than someone over twice his age. She doesn't have to be careful but he does. She gets told you aren't mad and he gets yelled at. She is a special little princess in a far away kingdom, getting electronics and praise thrown at her for doing what gets him punished \n\nYou are setting him up to hate you, his sister and maybe even an entire gender", "YTA", "YTA. Pretty obvious imo", "YATA your wife already told you what you did wrong \n\n\nThing is this in the long run will have negative effects on your children's relationship it was like this for me my mother was like you she saw my brother less so he got treated better and when I was young i spent a long time hating my brother Before i realized it's my mom's fault for treating us different \n\nEven if you had a good reason a child wouldn't see it and just think the other child is the favorite", "YTA. You\u2019re the parent of both kids and need to parent them both. You can\u2019t just give Cass whatever she asks for because you feel bad that you don\u2019t get to see her all the time. \n\nSounds like you punished Mark for normal wear and tear on an iPad. The iPad was 2 years old. Nothing he did caused the charge port on his iPad to wear out. \n\nOn the other hand, you rewarded Cass for carelessly handling her phone. Hers was an accident that could have been completely avoided. Maybe she needed to learn that throwing a $900 device is not a good idea.", "YTA, full stop. No part of this is not you being an AH, and frankly, a terrible father to both of your children. \n\nI feel so bad for Mark. He did nothing wrong, his iPad of TWO YEARS had a normal wear and tear issue, and he was punished for it. As he gets older, he\u2019s going to feel the favoritism, and he\u2019s going to lash out more and more for it. Which you\u2019ll blame on him, even though it\u2019s your fault. If he\u2019s smart he\u2019ll cut you off, and then you\u2019ll wonder why. And what\u2019s worse, your children will never really be able to be siblings, because he\u2019ll blame her for your failings.", "Yta- treat both the same dude. He's 8 and will only see the favoritism and not the reasoning behind it.", "YTA, with caveats. \n\nYou definitely were harder on him than you were on her. If she is known for taking care of her things, and he isn\u2019t, i get it, but it is a double standard. For the record, if her phone is very new you could also claim her iPhone repairs under your credit card used to purchase, which is a completely different situation than a two year old device. But ultimately, you were extremely hard on him and quite fawning and deferential to her and it definitely is a double standard on your part.", "OP, please reread your post. How can you Not understand?\n\n Your bias is so blatantly skewed to your daughter\u2019s favor. It does not matter why you are doing this \u2026. It only matters that you are. \n\nOne only has to read your description of both of your kids. \n\nYou have issues that are ruining your relationship with your partner and your son. You probably need a therapist to help you work on the resentment you appear to have towards him. \n\nOP, do better, because Both your kids need you. \n\nAgape \ud83d\udc95", "Also want to point out. Your daughter is old enough to fix this herself. \n\nMy daughter went cliff diving and lost her phone. This was 7 months after her father bought it. \n\nShe didn't even ask him to replace it. She asked me how to buy herself a new one and link it to the account.", "YTA- you cannot hold an 8yo to a higher standard than someone who is almost a legal adult. Neither should have been punished imo, accidents happen.", "Yta if am 8 year old has higher standards then a 18 year old you are failing both of them.", "YTA - completely. I have a SD and an \"our\" baby. My SO is way different with our son than SD, it really bothers me and our son. He can totally tell SD is the favored child. Its crap and I feel bad for your son.", "YTA. Do you even *like* your 8 year old? Because when you describe Cass, there's already an apologetically sympathetic tone. Distance, guilt, sensitive. If she needs money, you're ready to throw it to her. Then with Mark you describe him as argumentative, stronger personality, clumsy. The charging port on the iPad had an issue. Automatically you jump to blame him without thinking of other possibilities like dust being jammed into the port, the port being misaligned or disconnected, or a software failure after 2 years of usage. A quick search shows that charging port replacements for iPads can be pricy, but I doubt it's as expensive as a brand new iPhone... so Cass's very expensive stupid decision vs. Mark's much less expensive problem with an electronic means she gets her ass kissed and he gets bitched out and grounded.   \nBe real with yourself. Because of your guilt, you put Cass on a pedestal, and Mark can do no right because you see him every day so his flaws are more apparent. This is going to drive huge wedges between Cass and Mark (if the distance already hasn't), and Mark and yourself. He can see your favoritism toward her.   \n\n\nGo be a better dad to Mark. He deserves an apology at the very least.", "YTA and you know it.\nYou cannot treat your one kid differently in the exact same situation. Plus your wife is right, your son is under 10 years old, a primary school kid who cannot yet even legally earn his own money and you take away his allowance, but your daughter can work her a** off if she would need to because she is old enough. Also your son took good care or his device for over 2 yrs and I read in a comment the charger entrance broke? Thats a very different thing than dropping your iPhone and having its screen in pieces... \n\nThe fact you see your son every day and your daughter not does not have any say in how this situation should be viewed. Though you probably couldn't prevent her moving far away due to your ex wife, your son and current wife will start to resent you for treating her differently + you don't really teach your daughter how life will treat her if daddy doesn't pay for everything anymore....", "YTA. It's not Mark's fault you don't see his sister often. For all we know Cass could've been lying to you and just wanted money.", "YTA and I agree with your wife. You even admit to not wanting to hurt cass\u2019 feelings but clearly don\u2019t care about Mark when the same thing happened.", "YTA because you're setting an incredibly bad precedent for the way you treat your children unequally. Distance doesn't change parenting and what's good for one is good for all. He's 8 and has had his iPad for 2 years. That's long enough for a regular phone upgrade and he's being punished.... You owe your kid an apology.", "YTA. I\u2019m not going to say you\u2019re wrong for paying for the phone repairs because you\u2019re not. However, what you are wrong for is treating them differently. Considering the way they broke your daughter was being more \u201ccareless\u201d than your son because she dropped the phone while his charging port broke out of wear and tear which would happen eventually. Your wife is right, if you\u2019re paying for your daughter\u2019s you should pay for your son\u2019s. Plus if you live in the US, in pretty much all places your daughter can work to get money for repairs, your son; however, can\u2019t", "Buy him a new iPad. You already dropped the ball for blaming him for \u201cbreaking\u201d a 2 year old, worn out device. YTA for holding a child to a higher standard than a near adult.", "YTA\n\nCass is becoming the golden child.  Mark is becoming the scape goat.\n\n\"Cass broke her brand new iPhone only a month after getting it, while Mark had his iPad over 2 years before anything went wrong\"\n\nCase in point.  Cass was rewarded, Mark was punished.  Your excuses are complete BS.\n\nYTA", "I understand guilt is a very powerful motivator, but your wife is right. Out of guilt, you\u2019re absolutely favoring your daughter even though these circumstances are NOT the same. Your daughter barely had the phone while your son had his iPad for *two years*. Your daughter was careless and rough, not your son.\n\nIf you continue down this path, you will destroy both your relationship with your daughter and your son over your guilt. Your daughter will learn that all she has to do is guilt trip you to get whatever she wants, and your son will learn that you\u2019ll never treat him the way you do your daughter. Both of those are unhealthy outcomes.\n\nIt sucks your ex wife moved so far away, but that was *her* decision. You need to work through your guilt and become the parent both kids deserve.\n\nYTA.", "YTA. This is blatant favouritism. Your wife is correct, you handled this badly.", "YTA.  And a poor father to both your kids.  You're throwing money at Cass in an effort to make up for not being present in her life, and you're punishing mark for no reason (especially after you clarify in the comments that the charger wore out and thats how it \"broke.\"  How does him \"being rough with his stuff\" wear the charging port out?  Or did you just throw that fact in to try and justify your position) for something he doesn't have much control over.  Work on yourself so you can be a better father to both Cass and Mark.", "YTA for sure.\n\nCass is playing you and learning the results provide the feedback she wants. Don't continue to make this a habit. Expensive gifts are an unexpected surprise, but learning to take care of valuable things and dealing with breakages etc. is a life lesson that falls to the giftee- provide suggestions on how she can handle the situation, but don't White Knight it.\n\nAs for your son who is a literal rough-and-tumble CHILD, he got two freaking years out of an iPad. Tons of adults can't even do that. Get a squishy bouncy case, chat with him about proper usage, and support those habits instead of punishing him.\n\nWhat an odd situation overall.", "Dads on the fast track to only having a daughter.", "YTA you gave a 6 year old an iPad and they kept in working condition for 2 years! Honestly, that is a miracle. You know they sell children's tablets right?\n\nI highlight this because your kids are very different ages developmentally. It's fine to treat them differently. What is not fine is to hold an 8 year old to a higher standard than a 17 year old. \n\nAlso you need to set kids (people in general really) up for success. Mark at 8 is rough and clumsy. Can't imagine at 6 that he was gentle and careful. Yet the expectation is that he take care of a delicate item and never break it...ever? That doesn't sound realistic from the start.\n\nEdit the fact that your daughter legitimately broke her phone (throwing it) but your son's tablet isn't even broken and just needs regular maintenance (charging port) makes this so much worse. Again let's go back to realistic expectations. It is realistic to expect a 17 year old not ask a phone be thrown to her. What could Mark have done to prevent this? Get in a time machine and warp back to the very small time window in the early 2000s were devices started to be common but all companies purposely built devices to start falling apart at the 2 year mark? And honestly even that might my be possible because by the time the iPad was a thing that could have already have been common practice. Like to you see how extreme these two things are?\n\n No wonder your son talked back. You were taking money out of his allowance to teach him to treat his stuff better when by all accounts he has taken excellent care of his iPad. Even with the stuff with your daughter you'd still be an AH for this punishment.", "Yeah, gonna lean light YTA.\n\nKid's 8 and things eventually break and wear out. 2 years is a good run for an iPad, and actually argues against him just being \"clumsy\"\n\nBeing punitive against him when your daughter did basically the same thing is unfair. The fact you have guilt and have handle HER feelings with kid gloves should not be redirected to your son", "YTA just because you have guilt about your relationship with your daughter doesn't mean your son needs to be punished.", "My husband has a son living with his mom in another state and does the exact same thing. I\u2019ll tell you like I tell him\u2026 YOU CANNOT RAISE A CHILD IN GUILT! That will only cause your relationship with your other children to suffer.", "YTA. Your guilt is clouding your judgment. Plus a month-old phone that got broken due to negligence is not the same as a 2-year old tablet that got destroyed due to normal wear and tear. You owe your son at least an apology.", "YTA. Treat them equally.", "YTFA.   \nBe a better parent, and stop babying Cass and giving her whatever she wants. You're setting up Mark to think he doesn't matter to you by showing the person that doesn't even live with you more respect and love than you show him.", "Yta , and if u keep treating your daughter better than your son, he will grow up to hate both you and your daughter", "I was sympathising with you until you clarified the situation. Your almost grown daughter was negligent with new gift and you can't even be sure your young son actually broke his device or whether it was wear and tear! So you've treated them both wrongly for the situation. \n\nAlso how badly did your son argue about your decision I  order to deserve a 2 week grounding? I know it's annoying when children try to challenge your decisions but unless he said something terrible I can't understand why it deserved such a severe punishment?", "YTA for how how you reacted. \n\nSon has had the iPad since he was 6\u2026it lasted 2 years.

Cass is also extremely sensitive so I have to handle her very carefully as not to upset her.\n\nMark, on the other hand, is more out there, will try to argue back, and I tend to be a bit harder on him because he's got a stronger personality.\n\nAbout a month ago Cass called saying she broke her brand new iPhone I'd given her as an early birthday present and asked me to pay to get it fixed for her. Since I rarely get the chance to do stuff for Cass, I said yes, sent her the money and reassured her that I'm not mad, it was an accident, but please be more careful with her devices.\n\nA week later, Mark broke his iPad he's had for over 2 years. Mark is rough on his stuff and a bit on the clumsy side. I told Mark it's his fault for not paying more attention and its going to be a while until his iPad is going to be fixed and the money is going to come out of his allowance and I hope it teaches him to be more responsible. Mark started arguing with me and I ended up grounding him for 2 weeks, but really only followed through on the first week.\n\nNow my wife is mad at me, saying the way I reacted to Mark was unfair compared to the way I reacted to Cass. That I was forgiving and understanding to my daughter, who's older, but not my son, who's much younger. I tried to explain it as I don't see Cass much or get a chance to do as much for her, so anytime I can, I'm going to. Where I see and do stuff with Mark every day, so it's a different situation and I handled each as they needed to be handled.  My wife still insists I dropped the ball on the way I dealt with Mark and said I should have treated him the same way I did Cass and brought up the fact Cass broke her brand new iPhone only a month after getting it, while Mark had his iPad over 2 years before anything went wrong.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

No one that is in this situation, even your wife, truly understands the guilt you feel BUT your daughter knows this and plays into it. Your daughter is almost an adult and should 100% be held more responsible due to the way she broke it and her age. Your son's ipad broke out of wear and tear which is a common thing.
