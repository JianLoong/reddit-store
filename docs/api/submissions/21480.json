He was nice at the beginning and seemed like a good father figure. During the pandemic classes stopped and everyone stayed home. We all trusted this man so when the family started a bar business we would all stay up watching the customers and such. There was one night where after I got home from our shop, I was hanging out at our living room chatting with my boyfriend as I was charging my phone after a couple of drinks. The boyfriend came up to me to tell me good night (he was drinking as well) and it was normal at first but then suddenly he started to kiss me starting from my forehead down to my lips. I was terrified and frozen in place . I tried to curl up as I tied my hair to put some distance between us two. I ran to my room after he left and cried the whole night. After telling my sister after a couple of days later she told my mom then it was a big situation, but because of Covid we could not easily leave or move around. All in all my mom and siblings decided to stay with him at his place and I moved back to my hometown. After a year and lockdown was gone my siblings continued their studies. Their graduation is coming up and they could have only 2 guests with them. I thought my siblings would have me my mom and my dad as their guests only but my sister insisted that since the Boyfriend spent money for their studies he should be one of the guests and I am not interested to go anymore. My sister is now upset because I promised to go already but I am not comfortable with this situation. They are the ones that decided to stay and have him spend on their studies anyway.

I think I would be considered as the asshole because I already promised to go and their graduation is a different matter to what happened to me.

Is so mentally damming, something that stays with you many years after everyone else has already forgotten.\n\nEven if it was something small, if you're not comfortable you should go nor should you be forced into going either.", "NTA\n\nNTA at all. Already knew you weren\u2019t just from the title. If someone who sexually assaulted me, or even assaulted me in any kind of way at that, but especially sexually assault. I wouldn\u2019t wanna go either. You feel unsafe being around someone for whatever reason, you don\u2019t need to go.", "NTA and it's bizarre they'd expect you to be anywhere near the guy. They want to ignore it because it makes their lives easier. You don't get that luxury, and being pressured to act like nothing happened is another wound you have to live with. Treat yourself nice in another way and hit back hard (verbally) if they ever try to guilt or pressure you to be around the guy. Remind them what he did. A lot.", "Thank you everyone for your comments. I did feel like I wasnt the Asshole here but I just wanted to make sure it was just not me overreacting. Im also upset on having to make my siblings choose between me or the guy. I do want to go to celebrate this milestone with them but Id hate for it to be with him around. Im going to try and explain my situation well to them to find some common ground.", "Your sister is entitled to invite who she wants. \n\nYou are entitled to decline your invitation. \n\nYou\u2019ve been through an event.

You shouldn't have to bear the agony of seeing the dude again. Your sister shouldn't have invited him in the first place\u2014he cannot escape culpability just because he paid for your sister's education. I'm sorry you had to go through this.", "NTA\n\nYour mom's boyfriend is in the wrong and it's completly normal that you refuse to be around him.   \nHe did something wrong to you and to your mom ! He kissed someone else ! He kissed his girlfriend's daughter ! We could say that he tried to cheat on your mother with you. And not only is he trying to cheat, he's also doing it to a much younger person who lived in the same house. That's immoral and honestly disgusting. \n\nYour feelings are completly justified and anyone in their right mind can understand why you don't want to be near him anymore.   \nI think that your sister is in the wrong for being upset at you. She should be mad at your mom's boyfriend. He's the only one responsible for this situation. \n\nOP, I hope he will never try to do anything like this again to you or anyone else.

I felt it wouldve been selfish of me to also make them have the same kind of resentment for this long. This is also why im conflicted because what if Im the only one making a big deal of this", "It's more than bizzare that they have just papered over what has happened and are still living with/friendly with that guy. If that had happened to any of my family the would be out on his arse at the very least", "You are not over reacting, it's impossible to overreact to something like this.\nThe fact that after what he did to you they did not immediately shunned him is appalling imo and by not doing that they already choose him over you. Remaining neutral is siding with the perpetrator. \nI am so sorry that he did this to you and that your mother and sisters betrayed you. You deserve way better and you deserve to never have to even think about this guy again.\nI wish you the best and I hope that your mom and sisters finally do right by you and cut him out of their lives.", "Thats what I wanted to point out to her.
