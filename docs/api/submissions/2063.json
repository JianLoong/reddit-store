Rabies virus and ABLV are two different, distinct, but related lyssaviruses. \n\nHowever, from a human point of view there isn't much effective difference. If a human is infected with either and develops symptoms, those symptoms are pretty much identical for both lyssaviruses and follow the same progression, so we call that symptomatic illness *rabies* in both cases. The treatment protocol is the same.\n\nTo use your covid example, it'd be like if having a different coronavirus could give you identical symptoms and progression to Covid-19. You wouldn't test positive to SARS-CoV-2, but you'd probably get the same treatment protocol.\n\nThanks for the explanations, folks. That was an interesting learning experience."]}
