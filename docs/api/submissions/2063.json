This was a panic reaction during an emergency situation.", "NTA.  Kangaroos can be vicious animals, a kick to the stomach and he could be in hospital or worse.

You can apologize to him for cursing but certainly not for yelling at him when he disobeyed your safety rules.", "NTA\n\nCanadian here, and I see this all the time.

You can have a conversation with your cousin later about how you know you used severe language, but you wouldn\u2019t have done that if your cousin\u2019s life weren\u2019t actually in jeopardy.

Swearing aside, thank you for saving your cousin from potentially gaining live-changing injuries from a dangerous wild animal. I imagine your aunt and uncle didn't bother to thank you for that.", "NTA. You saved his dumb ass. I swear, these are the same people I see here in the states wanting to feed the bear or pet the moose or generally act like wild animals won't fuck you up and go on their merry way after wiping the annoying hairless ape outta their path.", "They\u2019re just mad because they don\u2019t use the word cunt in the US \ud83d\udc80 This is such an Australian post lmao", "NTA.

They are no flipping joke and zoos in the USA let you walk in their exhibit with them? Yeah no.", "NTA, I can understand that you might feel bad for how you spoke to him, but that doesn't make you the asshole. You were concerned for his safety and he was nearing an emergency situation he clearly didn't understand. \n\nYou set expectations around this outing and he did not follow them, there are consequences to that. He's lucky he didn't have significantly severe repercussions at the hands (or feet I guess) of that kangaroo. \n\nIf you want to apologize for the specific words you used, that's one thing, but you should not apologize for saving him from an emergency situation. If anything, you should explain why you reacted so \"harshly\", as he probably doesn't really understand the danger he was about to be in. As someone who has worked with wildlife in a rehab/release setting, people don't often grasp how quickly and easily they can get absolutely fucked up by wild animals. It's one thing to know something can hurt you, it's another to know and understand that it can and will throw itself at you, to intentionally hurt you, just because you got a little too close.", "He came *this close* to fucking around and finding out.  The dumbass was lucky to be merely yelled out instead of in the ICU or disemboweled. Find some photos of what has happened to others and then walk away in disgust...", "NTA. I\u2019m Alaskan. Tourists regularly get themselves killed here by being stupid around wildlife.", "NTA. Yelling at people being stupid and endangering themselves is most assuredly permitted.", "NTA\nI\u2019m an Aussie who lives in the US and this was such a refreshing read. Thank you for restoring some Australian in me.", "NTA, fellow aussie here.\n\nYou know what would suck more than getting yelled at? Having an angry red kangaroo attempt to disembowel you. For people that don't know, when OP says they are big it's worth noting that it's not just their stature - they are those muscular, ripped looking kangaroos with bulging pecs and arms you've probably seen memes about. \n\nThe three danger settings for a stationary kangaroo are:\n* head down eating, minimal danger\n* staring at you, some danger\n* puffing out chest and grunting, you need to leave right now tier danger\n\nIf cousin was getting the puffed out chest it was definitely time to gtfo.\n\nYou get a full pass for the swearing, I've seen people who won't use the word \"shit\" in a personal setting lose anything resembling a swear filter when having a run in with danger.", "NTA. \n\nWatched the clip of a family take a small child out of a SUV safari ride to get a closer look at the cheetahs. A clip of a young boy or girl get flipped by a wild buffalo. Even people at Zoos hop the fences and barriers to get close to the animals.\n\nA part of me believes that life lessons need to be learned. whether you learn through some saying not to do something, someone makes that mistake themselves, or a kid finds out the hard way that the big fluffy is gonna cheese grate him for not respecting boundaries.\n\nHurt feeling are a good outcome to what could possibly be a horrible traumatizing experience.", "NTA, you were responding to a very real dangerous situation.", "Nta. \n\nHe was walking towards the equivalent of a drop off cliff, you stopped him. \n\nBtw as an american never been to Australia, even I know not to approach kangaroos.", "I would go against the general mood here and say you were slightly TA. Your cousin doesn't understand the dangers of wildlife and he should never have gone so close to the kangaroo. But in the same way he also doesn't know \"the Australian way\" of talking. You yourself admit he looks upto you and the person he looks upto said some horrible words to him. He must be disheartened and surely won't look upto the way he used to. You could have scolded him without being so cussy. I understand that's how you talk but that's not an excuse. You are the elder one here.", "NTA. Maybe because i love animals its a no brainer as I do a ton of research on animals especially if im eventually going to buy them, but if you're going to seek out a specific animal wouldn't you want to do your research and find out what the warning signs are for when they feel threatened/ are going to attack?

It\u2019s along the lines of a parent freaking out when their child\u2019s about to run into traffic!  Emotions of fear manifesting as anger in the moment!  I\u2019m glad your cousin is okay!  You\u2019re NTA, maybe show those family members some vids online of the damage kangaroos can do so they can better understand your reaction to the situation!", "NTA and 16 is not really a child. I'm confident that he already knows and uses all of those words.", "Given that you didn't want him turned into \"red mist\" the language was quite colorful but probably not the worst that could have been said lol.   I would have yelled too hoping it shocked some sense into him.

Are their brains just missing?

There might not be the same exact wild animal but they should know what you are talking about.", "Just show them some videos of real Red Roo attacks, tell them \"THIS SHIT is what I was freaked out and yelling about!\" Would you WANT THIS? Or is it better that it was prevented?", "Op ignore your aunt and uncle. If they want to keep being pissy and not let it drop tell them to go get a hotel. If they try to start shit in the family tell everyone what happened. If they have a brain they\u2019ll shame your aunt and uncle not you..take your baby cousin out to eat just the two of you. Talk with the kid, maybe look into something the two of you can do. Like maybe find a sanctuary or something that lets you pet wallaby\u2019s.

Thats more scary than an animal just killing you straight out.", "My family are all on my side. We are definitely bush people that know not to fuck with animals while my uncle (american) and aunt (still Australian but not very bright) are city people. I plan to take my cousin down to rottenness island tho so he can see some quokkas", "This reminds me of Oklahoma Department of Wildlife Conservation's tweet that asked people not to let coguars and other wildlife inside their house.", "True, the rabies shots hurt. Particularly the prophylactic serum they inject into the bites. But that is only once for each bite the rabies vaccine is 4 times like 4 days apart so you still remember vividly how much they suck", "In the end op it\u2019s your cousin who matters here, not his parents. So really tell both of them get over it or get out especially the husband, it sounds like he needs to be reminded this isn\u2019t his home turf so he\u2019s not the expect on anything and needs to quit acting like he has a clue. Let the family shame your aunt some for forgetting her roots too."]}
