{"id": 24875, "submission_id": "15tuffv", "title": "AITA for wanting my daughter to have a relationship with her future stepsibling?", "selftext": "A little under five years ago, I (48M) got divorced from my ex-wife Denise (46F). We have a daughter named Emily (16F), and although she primarily lives with Denise, I'm still very much a part of her life. Emily and I had a very strong relationship until last year, when I started dating my fiancee Adrianna (F33). Adrianna and I had very different lives before we started dating: while I work as a corporate executive, Adrianna is a single mother with two kids (14F and 8M) and she works as a secretary at my company (different departments, so our relationship's completely aboveboard.) Because her kids' father isn't in the picture, I've begun to step up a little with her kids to take care of them, though this hasn't impacted my relationship with Emily. However, both Denise and Emily dislike Adrianna, as Denise thinks she's a whore while Emily thinks that she's after my (and by extension, her) money. I'm aware that the age gap probably plays into this heavily. Additionally, Emily doesn't interact with either of Adrianna's kids, going so far as to completely ignore them when they're in the same space.\n\nAfter Adrianna and I got engaged last month, I pulled Emily aside and told her that I wanted her to have some sort of a relationship with Raquel, Adrianna's daughter. Her son, I understand them not interacting as much, as she's twice his age and they have little in common, but Raquel looks up to Emily in spite of how she treats her. I told her that she didn't have to be a sister or even a friend to Raquel, but I thought that both of them would benefit from talking to one another. Emily refused and walked off after that, claiming that she wanted nothing to do with \"that gold digger's kids.\" I don't plan to force Emily to do anything she doesn't want to, but I still think she's being unnecessarily cruel.", "created_utc": 1692294435, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15tuffv/aita_for_wanting_my_daughter_to_have_a/", "score": 38, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You\u2019re absolutely an idiot if you don\u2019t think she\u2019s going to complain and if you keep trying to force a relationship, it\u2019s going to be horribly toxic and you will end up never speaking to your daughter once she hits 18.", "YTA.

But you do not get to request a relationship.", "YTA- your daughter is well within her right not have anything to do with those kids.

Do you guys ever have 1:1 time together? \n\nMy father remarried a much younger woman when I was a kid, she had a kid from a previous marriage and they eventually had two kids together. I absolutely hated going over to their house because I never actually got any quality time with him when I was there, and I didn\u2019t like stepmother (affair partner and also just generally awful person) or any of the kids who were all particularly poorly behaved. I was a really anxious kid (mostly bc of my parent\u2019s divorce) and even when no one was fighting or even bothering me, I still couldn\u2019t ever really relax. It wasn\u2019t my home, it was like I was just a guest, and it was super uncomfortable. As soon as I was allowed to choose whether or not to go over there, I chose not to. I would still see my dad if we could plan a time to meet elsewhere, like to grab lunch sometime when the rest of the crew wasn\u2019t there. Never stopped loving my dad, but really hated that I never got any time just with him, that I always had to be around him with this new family that I didn\u2019t choose and didn\u2019t like. \n\nI don\u2019t know what the living situation/quality time was for you and Emily before, but regardless it sounds like Emily is unhappy about how things are now, and this is how she is relaying it to you. Maybe it\u2019s not the most mature or productive, but she\u2019s a child who is upset. It would be lovely if everyone got along, but that\u2019s not going to happen now (if ever). Asking Emily to try is probably just going to make her push back more. Asking what you can do to be a better dad to her, reassuring her of your love, and at least trying to prioritize her may make it easier for her to feel comfortable or less unhappy with the situation. (Note: I\u2019m assuming that you do love her and want to be a good dad to her. Feel free to disregard my entire comment if you prioritize your new family.)", "YTA\n\n Your daughter should be first. If she doesn't like your fiancee, i suggest you take that into consideration before marrying her and imposing her kids on your daughter.

Put your daughter first.", "Eh kinda YTA? I get where you\u2019re coming from completely. But, kids not coming around to step siblings and step parents isn\u2019t exactly anything new. You should have known this could happen. You\u2019ve told her how you feel but I wouldn\u2019t mention it or push it any further. She has to want to develop a relationship with her step-sister on her own. Not because you told her to. She\u2019ll just resent the both of you if it doesn\u2019t come from her. She\u2019s a teenager. All she sees is you trying to replace her mom with someone else. The age gap doesn\u2019t help either. If I was 16 and my dad who was nearly 50, started dating a woman in her early 30s, I\u2019d probably call her gold digger too.", "I guess, NAH, but dude, you can't be surprised by this. Corporate executive dating a much-younger secretary from his company. You're a stereotype, and not a good one, and it's understandable why your daughter isn't happy.

Have you asked you ex why she is doing this? Because it sounds like the divorce was amicable and this is out of character for her. If she\u2019s normally a reasonable person, you may want to ask her if something else is going on.

Distance is the best thing if you ever want that to happen, not proximity. She's far too old to be forced into that type of relationship and she is her own person now.

The most you can demand is civility.   And ignoring them seems the best you're gonna get atm.", "INFO: Have you considered trying therapy together? It can really help to have a neutral third party broker conversations like these. You can\u2019t force her to have a relationship she doesn\u2019t want with the 14 yo, but through therapy you might both find ways to let go of the resentment that clearly exists here on both sides. \n\nShe\u2019s 16. At that age, if my nearly 50 yo dad replaced my mom with a 30 something secretary, I\u2019d be deeply disappointed in him, not just as my father, but as a man and a human being. It would completely alter my opinion of him. It communicates: my existence wasn\u2019t enough for you to stick around, and you are a weak person. She doesn\u2019t get yet - because she hasn\u2019t experienced adult relationships - that this was something you needed to do to take care of your own wellbeing and therefore make you a better father for her (cuz when your well-being feels right, you are better able to address the wellbeing of others). \n\nShe may come around once she\u2019s older, but I really wouldn\u2019t make that bet by just letting this play out and being passive. You need to be proactive and take action, or you might not have a relationship with her in the future. That\u2019s what your betting here: your entire relationship with her. College is approaching. Your time to get this right is limited. \n\nAlso, do you worry she\u2019s parroting your ex\u2019s words back? Like the gold digger comment?", "NTA  \nYou are not an asshole for asking her to be decent and respectful. If you continue to force it you might be. There is obviously some animosity here that doesn't track. But she is going to have to work out her feelings. My suggestion is to not force it, give it time; and hopefully she'll see the benefits of being a good human and older step-sister.", "NAH You can't force families to \"blend\". You asked your daughter to consider having a relationship with your fiancee's children. She said no. You need at accept your daughter considers your fiancee as nothing more than your partner and her children are her children. Your daughter doesn't want to know them from Adam.", "Nta yet but if you keep pushing your younger fiances kids on Emily you definitely will be. Be an actual father and listen to your kid", "NAH. You can want your kid and your step kids to be friends, but you can't make them. Honestly, that's just as true with blood related siblings as it is step-siblings. (It also applies to step-kid and step-parent relationships, by the way). Set up an expectation that everyone in the home be treated with a baseline level of respect, but make that baseline as simple as you possibly can. I tell my kids they have to treat everyone at least as nice as they would treat a bank teller: you don't have to interact with them often, but when you do it should include listening, making requests not giving orders, and using please and thank you. If you can't do that, avoiding them entirely is 100% an option except at dinner. At dinner, feel free to sit silently until everyone is done and avoid eye contact or whatever. We will be interacting pleasantly if you'd like to join. \n\nAfter that, all you can do is make sure that the household rules/expectations apply to all people equally. Failure to apply the rules equally on your part can create big problems on the kids' end, so don't mess that up for them. Let them avoid each other. Maybe someday they will make friends. Maybe your oldest will go to college in two years and never speak to  their step-family again. Either way, it's not your right to make that call.\n\nEdited to add: Your daughter isn't being cruel because your relationship choices, and any kids that go along with that, are not her responsibility. She is also going through a lot of things at once right now: her parents are divorced, her mom is bitter, her dad is engaged to someone 15 years younger who comes with children he spends more time with than he spends with her...that's a lot for a teenager to handle. As long as she isn't being harmful, let her cope how she needs to.\n\nFor you, I recommend developing a sense of humor. My fiance is 14 years older than I am, and my kids were older teens when they met him. They give both of us a hard time about it, and we just laugh with them. My youngest (14) got him a cup for Father's Day that said \"worlds okayest guy who's banging my mom\" and they both laughed and hugged. He keeps it on his desk like a trophy because my kid went to all the trouble of making a custom mug, especially for him. When his kid is like \"omg you are like practically the same age as me!\" (they are 11, I am 37) I say \"I know! I guess your dad just wanted to find someone you had a lot in common with. So thoughtful, that guy.\" We all give each other space to feel how we feel and so get along quite well. I don't think it would have happened if we *forced* anybody to like anybody else or thought of each other as \"cruel\". Think positively about your kids and they'll live up to it.", "NTA, but I wouldn't force the relationship. 14 and 16 have some pretty big milestones between them, so even if the numerical difference isn't large, the experience gap is. If you're going to marry Adrianna, they're going to be forced to interact eventually. I would force them to be civil (to both Adrianna and her kids), but let the rest evolve (or not evolve) naturally.\n\nYour ex sounds like she's been bad-mouthing you and Adrianna to her kids, which isn't great. I actually think this is more a ***ex*** issue than a daughter issue. She shouldn't be weaponizing your kids to hurt you. That only hurts them.\n\nAlso, I would not sweat the age gap. Adrianna is in her 30s and you're in your 40s. You both have children of similar ages. I think it's more pissing off your ex-wife who feels like you threw her over for a younger model. But it's really not fair of her to take it out on you by weaponizing your kids. This is probably an opportunity for you to create a more pleasant and relaxed home atmosphere if you decide to militantly *reject* the drama your ex is trying to create and remain open and understanding to your daughter without telling her what to think. Eventually, she will come around. I know I did when I eventually realized how my mom weaponized me against my dad and stepmother and how my dad tried really, really hard not to play that game.", "NTA for wanting them to have a relationship.  but you have to let these things evolve naturally.  you can't force anyone to have a relationship with anyone else.  otherwise, you're really going to ruin your relationship with her.  i'm not saying let her do whatever she wants at any given time, but this is a tough time for her and her feelings need to be validated.  her already broken family is now being broken even more, and she has to share her time with you, with other people.  just try to understand what she's going through, or at the very least have some empathy for her feelings.", "I\u201dve gotta disagree with all of the Y T A\u2019s here.

Continue to see your daughter 1 X 1 but don\u2019t expect more than that.  She has shown you that she won\u2019t give it.  Also, you need to redirect Raquel before she gets really hurt.  Emily isn\u2019t her sister and never will be.  Your doing wrong by Raquel.\n\nNTA.", "NAH\n\nTalk to your daughter and what are her reasons to think that your fiancee is a gold digger.\n\nTell her, that your new wife makes you happy and that  you are aware about the financial differences. But that she should understand that it's not easy to find a partner that is equally wealthy. One person always will have a little bit more money and if you would have a richer partner, YOU would be called the golddigger from her family..", "NTA.  This will not be an easy road for you to smooth.  Your daughter is already jaundiced towards your fianc\u00e9e and her children, likely influenced by comments made by her mother.  It's sad when that happens, but it is not at all uncommon.

We have a daughter named Emily (16F), and although she primarily lives with Denise, I'm still very much a part of her life. Emily and I had a very strong relationship until last year, when I started dating my fiancee Adrianna (F33). Adrianna and I had very different lives before we started dating: while I work as a corporate executive, Adrianna is a single mother with two kids (14F and 8M) and she works as a secretary at my company (different departments, so our relationship's completely aboveboard.) Because her kids' father isn't in the picture, I've begun to step up a little with her kids to take care of them, though this hasn't impacted my relationship with Emily. However, both Denise and Emily dislike Adrianna, as Denise thinks she's a whore while Emily thinks that she's after my (and by extension, her) money. I'm aware that the age gap probably plays into this heavily. Additionally, Emily doesn't interact with either of Adrianna's kids, going so far as to completely ignore them when they're in the same space.\n\nAfter Adrianna and I got engaged last month, I pulled Emily aside and told her that I wanted her to have some sort of a relationship with Raquel, Adrianna's daughter. Her son, I understand them not interacting as much, as she's twice his age and they have little in common, but Raquel looks up to Emily in spite of how she treats her. I told her that she didn't have to be a sister or even a friend to Raquel, but I thought that both of them would benefit from talking to one another. Emily refused and walked off after that, claiming that she wanted nothing to do with \"that gold digger's kids.\" I don't plan to force Emily to do anything she doesn't want to, but I still think she's being unnecessarily cruel.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

It could highly likely be that in your daughter's mind she sees them as basically your \"new\" family and she has fears of being \"replaced\". Due to the delicate of current events in all of your guys' life I also reccommend you and your daughter go to therapy/couseling because its vital for both of your relationship to understand why she feels the way she does if you want to sustain a healthy and mature bond. \n\nAlso, when/if she does agree and share her inner thoughts always remember it's important to stay understanding and encouraging to your daughter and don't blame her for how she feels about certain events or people.
