{"id": 24875, "submission_id": "15tuffv", "title": "AITA for wanting my daughter to have a relationship with her future stepsibling?", "selftext": "A little under five years ago, I (48M) got divorced from my ex-wife Denise (46F). We have a daughter named Emily (16F), and although she primarily lives with Denise, I'm still very much a part of her life. Emily and I had a very strong relationship until last year, when I started dating my fiancee Adrianna (F33). Adrianna and I had very different lives before we started dating: while I work as a corporate executive, Adrianna is a single mother with two kids (14F and 8M) and she works as a secretary at my company (different departments, so our relationship's completely aboveboard.) Because her kids' father isn't in the picture, I've begun to step up a little with her kids to take care of them, though this hasn't impacted my relationship with Emily. However, both Denise and Emily dislike Adrianna, as Denise thinks she's a whore while Emily thinks that she's after my (and by extension, her) money. I'm aware that the age gap probably plays into this heavily. Additionally, Emily doesn't interact with either of Adrianna's kids, going so far as to completely ignore them when they're in the same space.\n\nAfter Adrianna and I got engaged last month, I pulled Emily aside and told her that I wanted her to have some sort of a relationship with Raquel, Adrianna's daughter. Her son, I understand them not interacting as much, as she's twice his age and they have little in common, but Raquel looks up to Emily in spite of how she treats her. I told her that she didn't have to be a sister or even a friend to Raquel, but I thought that both of them would benefit from talking to one another. Emily refused and walked off after that, claiming that she wanted nothing to do with \"that gold digger's kids.\" I don't plan to force Emily to do anything she doesn't want to, but I still think she's being unnecessarily cruel.", "created_utc": 1692294435, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15tuffv/aita_for_wanting_my_daughter_to_have_a/", "score": 1805, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You\u2019re absolutely an idiot if you don\u2019t think she\u2019s going to complain and if you keep trying to force a relationship, it\u2019s going to be horribly toxic and you will end up never speaking to your daughter once she hits 18.", "YTA. For asking they have some type of relationship. You don\u2019t get to ask that. You do get to declare she is civil to her new step siblings. But you do not get to request a relationship.", "YTA- your daughter is well within her right not have anything to do with those kids.

Do you guys ever have 1:1 time together? \n\nMy father remarried a much younger woman when I was a kid, she had a kid from a previous marriage and they eventually had two kids together. I absolutely hated going over to their house because I never actually got any quality time with him when I was there, and I didn\u2019t like stepmother (affair partner and also just generally awful person) or any of the kids who were all particularly poorly behaved. I was a really anxious kid (mostly bc of my parent\u2019s divorce) and even when no one was fighting or even bothering me, I still couldn\u2019t ever really relax. It wasn\u2019t my home, it was like I was just a guest, and it was super uncomfortable. As soon as I was allowed to choose whether or not to go over there, I chose not to. I would still see my dad if we could plan a time to meet elsewhere, like to grab lunch sometime when the rest of the crew wasn\u2019t there. Never stopped loving my dad, but really hated that I never got any time just with him, that I always had to be around him with this new family that I didn\u2019t choose and didn\u2019t like. \n\nI don\u2019t know what the living situation/quality time was for you and Emily before, but regardless it sounds like Emily is unhappy about how things are now, and this is how she is relaying it to you. Maybe it\u2019s not the most mature or productive, but she\u2019s a child who is upset. It would be lovely if everyone got along, but that\u2019s not going to happen now (if ever). Asking Emily to try is probably just going to make her push back more. Asking what you can do to be a better dad to her, reassuring her of your love, and at least trying to prioritize her may make it easier for her to feel comfortable or less unhappy with the situation. (Note: I\u2019m assuming that you do love her and want to be a good dad to her. Feel free to disregard my entire comment if you prioritize your new family.)", "YTA\n\n Your daughter should be first. If she doesn't like your fiancee, i suggest you take that into consideration before marrying her and imposing her kids on your daughter.

Put your daughter first.", "Eh kinda YTA? I get where you\u2019re coming from completely. But, kids not coming around to step siblings and step parents isn\u2019t exactly anything new. You should have known this could happen. You\u2019ve told her how you feel but I wouldn\u2019t mention it or push it any further. She has to want to develop a relationship with her step-sister on her own. Not because you told her to. She\u2019ll just resent the both of you if it doesn\u2019t come from her. She\u2019s a teenager. All she sees is you trying to replace her mom with someone else. The age gap doesn\u2019t help either. If I was 16 and my dad who was nearly 50, started dating a woman in her early 30s, I\u2019d probably call her gold digger too.", "I guess, NAH, but dude, you can't be surprised by this. Corporate executive dating a much-younger secretary from his company. You're a stereotype, and not a good one, and it's understandable why your daughter isn't happy.

You're not wrong for wanting them to have a healthy relationship, but the fact is that everyone is skeeved out by a nearly 50 year old man dating a younger secretary and it's going to poison all these relationships because you appear to be an old creep.\n\nYou can blame Emily all you want but ultimately she is a child and these are the incredibly predictable consequences of your actions.", "INFO:  was the divorce amicable?

Also, it sounds like you guys got engaged pretty soon which would definitely be overwhelming to your daughter, especially with her already negative opinions if your fianc\u00e9.

Emily should be expected to use her manners. She definitely needs a therapist because it sounds like your ex is using your daughter as a lightning rod for her own feelings about your new relationship. Have you asked you ex why she is doing this? Because it sounds like the divorce was amicable and this is out of character for her. If she\u2019s normally a reasonable person, you may want to ask her if something else is going on.

Distance is the best thing if you ever want that to happen, not proximity. She's far too old to be forced into that type of relationship and she is her own person now. You gotta take things as they are and just roll with it. You have 2 families currently, not one. Trying to make it anything more than that might result in irreparable damage with your daughter.

It can really help to have a neutral third party broker conversations like these. You can\u2019t force her to have a relationship she doesn\u2019t want with the 14 yo, but through therapy you might both find ways to let go of the resentment that clearly exists here on both sides. \n\nShe\u2019s 16. At that age, if my nearly 50 yo dad replaced my mom with a 30 something secretary, I\u2019d be deeply disappointed in him, not just as my father, but as a man and a human being. It would completely alter my opinion of him. It communicates: my existence wasn\u2019t enough for you to stick around, and you are a weak person. She doesn\u2019t get yet - because she hasn\u2019t experienced adult relationships - that this was something you needed to do to take care of your own wellbeing and therefore make you a better father for her (cuz when your well-being feels right, you are better able to address the wellbeing of others). \n\nShe may come around once she\u2019s older, but I really wouldn\u2019t make that bet by just letting this play out and being passive. You need to be proactive and take action, or you might not have a relationship with her in the future. That\u2019s what your betting here: your entire relationship with her. College is approaching. Your time to get this right is limited. \n\nAlso, do you worry she\u2019s parroting your ex\u2019s words back? Like the gold digger comment?", "NTA  \nYou are not an asshole for asking her to be decent and respectful. If you continue to force it you might be. There is obviously some animosity here that doesn't track. But she is going to have to work out her feelings. My suggestion is to not force it, give it time; and hopefully she'll see the benefits of being a good human and older step-sister.", "[deleted]", "Nta yet but if you keep pushing your younger fiances kids on Emily you definitely will be. Be an actual father and listen to your kid", "NAH. You can want your kid and your step kids to be friends, but you can't make them. Honestly, that's just as true with blood related siblings as it is step-siblings. (It also applies to step-kid and step-parent relationships, by the way). Set up an expectation that everyone in the home be treated with a baseline level of respect, but make that baseline as simple as you possibly can. I tell my kids they have to treat everyone at least as nice as they would treat a bank teller: you don't have to interact with them often, but when you do it should include listening, making requests not giving orders, and using please and thank you. If you can't do that, avoiding them entirely is 100% an option except at dinner. At dinner, feel free to sit silently until everyone is done and avoid eye contact or whatever. We will be interacting pleasantly if you'd like to join. \n\nAfter that, all you can do is make sure that the household rules/expectations apply to all people equally. Failure to apply the rules equally on your part can create big problems on the kids' end, so don't mess that up for them. Let them avoid each other. Maybe someday they will make friends. Maybe your oldest will go to college in two years and never speak to  their step-family again. Either way, it's not your right to make that call.\n\nEdited to add: Your daughter isn't being cruel because your relationship choices, and any kids that go along with that, are not her responsibility. She is also going through a lot of things at once right now: her parents are divorced, her mom is bitter, her dad is engaged to someone 15 years younger who comes with children he spends more time with than he spends with her...that's a lot for a teenager to handle. As long as she isn't being harmful, let her cope how she needs to.\n\nFor you, I recommend developing a sense of humor. My fiance is 14 years older than I am, and my kids were older teens when they met him. They give both of us a hard time about it, and we just laugh with them. My youngest (14) got him a cup for Father's Day that said \"worlds okayest guy who's banging my mom\" and they both laughed and hugged. He keeps it on his desk like a trophy because my kid went to all the trouble of making a custom mug, especially for him. When his kid is like \"omg you are like practically the same age as me!\" (they are 11, I am 37) I say \"I know! I guess your dad just wanted to find someone you had a lot in common with. So thoughtful, that guy.\" We all give each other space to feel how we feel and so get along quite well. I don't think it would have happened if we *forced* anybody to like anybody else or thought of each other as \"cruel\". Think positively about your kids and they'll live up to it.", "NTA, but I wouldn't force the relationship. 14 and 16 have some pretty big milestones between them, so even if the numerical difference isn't large, the experience gap is. If you're going to marry Adrianna, they're going to be forced to interact eventually. I would force them to be civil (to both Adrianna and her kids), but let the rest evolve (or not evolve) naturally.\n\nYour ex sounds like she's been bad-mouthing you and Adrianna to her kids, which isn't great. I actually think this is more a ***ex*** issue than a daughter issue. She shouldn't be weaponizing your kids to hurt you. That only hurts them.\n\nAlso, I would not sweat the age gap. Adrianna is in her 30s and you're in your 40s. You both have children of similar ages. I think it's more pissing off your ex-wife who feels like you threw her over for a younger model. But it's really not fair of her to take it out on you by weaponizing your kids. This is probably an opportunity for you to create a more pleasant and relaxed home atmosphere if you decide to militantly *reject* the drama your ex is trying to create and remain open and understanding to your daughter without telling her what to think. Eventually, she will come around.

Continue to see your daughter 1 X 1 but don\u2019t expect more than that.  She has shown you that she won\u2019t give it.  Also, you need to redirect Raquel before she gets really hurt.

One person always will have a little bit more money and if you would have a richer partner, YOU would be called the golddigger from her family..", "NTA.  This will not be an easy road for you to smooth.  Your daughter is already jaundiced towards your fianc\u00e9e and her children, likely influenced by comments made by her mother.  It's sad when that happens, but it is not at all uncommon.  She is likely also experiencing some of her own angst and insecurity over the changes that are happening as you remarry someone with children.  \n\nYou, of course, realize you cannot demand that Emily like Raquel but you can expect her to be kind because that will be what you expect from everyone in the family.  You need to let Emily know how much she means to you and always will and that you hope, in time, she will accept the changes your marrying Adrianna will bring.  Remind her that even with these changes, she can count on you to still be there for her.  \n\nShe's 16 and so probably won't be the easiest to deal with but be firm in expecting kindness (which means you don't ignore others) and give her time to accept the changes.  Relationships happen with time and shared experiences.  Make sure you create situations that do just that.  Good luck.", "NTA for wanting that, but you can't force it.\n\nGive it time.

We have a daughter named Emily (16F), and although she primarily lives with Denise, I'm still very much a part of her life. Emily and I had a very strong relationship until last year, when I started dating my fiancee Adrianna (F33). Adrianna and I had very different lives before we started dating: while I work as a corporate executive, Adrianna is a single mother with two kids (14F and 8M) and she works as a secretary at my company (different departments, so our relationship's completely aboveboard.) Because her kids' father isn't in the picture, I've begun to step up a little with her kids to take care of them, though this hasn't impacted my relationship with Emily. However, both Denise and Emily dislike Adrianna, as Denise thinks she's a whore while Emily thinks that she's after my (and by extension, her) money. I'm aware that the age gap probably plays into this heavily. Additionally, Emily doesn't interact with either of Adrianna's kids, going so far as to completely ignore them when they're in the same space.\n\nAfter Adrianna and I got engaged last month, I pulled Emily aside and told her that I wanted her to have some sort of a relationship with Raquel, Adrianna's daughter. Her son, I understand them not interacting as much, as she's twice his age and they have little in common, but Raquel looks up to Emily in spite of how she treats her. I told her that she didn't have to be a sister or even a friend to Raquel, but I thought that both of them would benefit from talking to one another. Emily refused and walked off after that, claiming that she wanted nothing to do with \"that gold digger's kids.\" I don't plan to force Emily to do anything she doesn't want to, but I still think she's being unnecessarily cruel.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Your daughter is at an angsty age and she's not going to behave maturely, and you aren't going to make things better by pressuring her to interact with either of these kids. You just have to accept the fact they may never become friendly. Tell your daughter it's her choice if she doesn't want to have a relationship with them but that she has zero reason to be rude or disrespectful towards any of them and you wont allow it in your home.

Why is nobody reading that part?", "She's just ignoring them, what's the problem? No, seriously. She's not throwing tantrums, destroying things or calling either step mom or step sis names, at least not within earshot. She's just not talking to them.\n\nAnd the rate this is going no they're not going to be in her life for many years, because OP is willing to throw his relationship with her under the bus over having her own opinion. (Heck given anything kiddo might even be right.) So at this rate OP is going to consider really carefully if he wants a relationship with his daughter once she's no longer legally obligated to see him.", "You \u201ctry\u201d to meet her for dinner / lunch once per week. I am not judging you, but I grew up with divorced parents. My dad was not a part of my life. My mom brought me up alone. One meal per week does not mean you are making her a priority. It means you are doing the bare minimum. She went from living with you to having you for herself once per week, if you try hard enough. It is not exactly a healthy parenting relationship, and I can see why she is upset about your moving so fast. Please take into account her age too - she is at a point in her life when her outlook on everything is being formed, everything is challenging, and she is adapting to young adulthood. And she is doing it with one parent, while her father has taken to fathering other kids, who are complete strangers to her. She needs love and stability, and she probably sees her current situation as a betrayal.", "Raquel , Raquel, Raquel ! You have replaced Emily with Raquel. Tell Raquel to leave her alone and not start any conversations. It is so obvious what is going on here. Raquel gets a rich father who lives with her and also gets private schooling. She will get her dream wedding with you walking down the aisle. Your real daughter will walk out of your life because you are pushing her away.", "Because it's easier for him to be a parent accessory to his current partner than have an independent relationship with a child even his own child.", "Oh you mean the part where he takes time away from his daughter to be with his new honey baby.  She saw him coming before he leave home the day she started working there.", "I was away from my ex for about 10 years before I married my husband. We have been married for twelve years now. My ex or his wife still sends my husband the occasional message that I\u2019m a whore, bitch and will ruin his life etc. Some people are simply messed up in the head. It can and does happen.", "Because he might have been the one who left, and mom's my just projecting her own experience...", "Yeah. My parents learned this the hard way after I figured it out at 15. They were too narcissistic to look for outside help. So, I ran wild until I moved out three years later.\n\n\n\nI lived as if I had zero rules. I'd get home at all hours... if I came home. I was always drunk and high. I did just enough work to graduate with a 1.1 GPA. And I did absolutely nothing to help out around the house.\n\n\n\nIt was a terrible thing, but I reveled in it while I lived it.", "I suspect you underestimate the absolute attachment some middle aged dudes have to sticking their dicks in younger chicks.", "He \u201ctold\u201d her. He didn\u2019t ask.", "I love that a 33 year old with a teenager is considered young \ud83d\ude02", "Were you never told, \"You don't have to be friends, but you do have to be nice to 'x' \" as a kid.", "She wanted them to move in then?", "The bingo will come when they have their own baby and he wonders why his daughter won\u2019t see her new sibling. And there definitely will be a new baby to seal the deal and for child support once she divorces him.", "Where is the big inheritance?", "I feel that so many young girls grow up learning that it\u2019s natural they\u2019d be replaced by someone younger when they hit middle age. Their own fathers leave the family and find new partners (the latter is to be expected) with, sometimes, little consideration for how destructive the dissolution of the marriage is for the children involved. I suspect this is what is going on here.", "Did you even read the post? They've been divorced for 5 years... homewrecker my ass.", "I was with you until you introduced that bizarre fantasy about the affair. No reasonable person would imagine that. It has nothing to do with the situation, it's some kind of weird soap opera you imagined.", "This. Although I actually got along with my Stepmom and her kids from a previous marriage, I always felt like a guest at their house and never felt like I was an equal part of that side of the family and those kids had priority over me.", "Exactly. I feel like people ignored when op said he wouldn't force her to be friends and doesn't need them to be super close, he just wants them to talk and be civil because they're step siblings whether she likes it or not. I think the mother is encouraging this hostility out of spite or jealousy. If he started favoring his step kids over his daughter then he's an A but for now I'm going with NTA.", "He never stated his daughter had concerns about an inheritance. He said she called the fianc\u00e9 a gold digger. Which she probably is.", "But even they didn't want OP as a writer so they're trying here.", "Ignoring someone in your home trying to talk to you or ask you a question is absolutely rude. It's childish", "Yeah this. Its like people try to read what they want it to say, not what it ACTUALLY say", "What makes her a gold digger? I\u2019m genuinely curious. She\u2019s a widowed single mom. Predictably, she earns less than him. That alone hardly makes her a gold digger.", "Can confirm. Dad was a deadbeat blamed my mom when in reality my mom never said a negative thing about him.", "OP is 48 years old and there's no reason to believe they're unable to make their own decisions. I trust OPs judgement over the ex wife or his 16 year old daughter.", "Sounds like Op\u2019s ex is jealous and poisoning her daughter.\n\nMom could gently encourage her daughter to be open to this, instead she\u2019s planting ideas that she\u2019s a good-digger. It comes across as parental alienation.\n\nThe woman is over 30 and obviously has had serious relationships. Op isn\u2019t dating a virgin 19 year old. Not every age gap is bad.", "they're grasping for straws to defend their preconceived notions", "She's at the mom's most of the time", "And Emily has to share her room at dad's place with her new stepsister. Fun!", "My parents never even bothered to get divorced. Just bitched to me about each other for most of my life. Even when dad died, mum still continued to blame him for everything. Including the cost of the funeral.", "It\u2019s implied", "That\u2019s terrible. My dad never said anything positive about my mom even when it was him in the wrong the entire marriage. It\u2019s toxic and pinning kids against the other parent is heartbreaking", "No doubt the ex-wife has been putting some thoughts into the daughters head"]}
