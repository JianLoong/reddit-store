I hadn\u2019t had any push back or texts from her all week until I reached out today.\n\nShe lets me know that me not texting her all week was a red flag and she was no longer interested in meeting as I didn\u2019t prioritize her.

Let this one go. If you kept texting her, she'd be annoyed that you ignored what she said about being busy. Instead, you gave her space and she's mad you listened to her when she said she was busy. You're both very young, and she's either not good at communicating or being very manipulative.", "Definitely NTA. She said she was busy, you gave her space, you then text her after she didn\u2019t respond. She then tells you it\u2019s a red flag that you weren\u2019t texting her when she could\u2019ve easily done so herself. There are red flags all over this post but not from you OP.", "The only red flag is her bullshit, especially after you told her you\u2019d told her what you\u2019d do on the basis of her telling you she\u2019d be busy. \n\nCall it a bullet dodged and drop her number.", "She's the \ud83d\udea9red flag. NTA.", "NTA. Not texting someone when they are busy is not a red flag. Calling it a red flag is. You dodged a bullet buddy, be happy.", "NTA - She says she\u2019s busy then gets mad at you for respecting that fact? I\u2019d just forget about her and find someone else if I were you. You never met so no big loss.", "I would bet she could have had time to meet, but probably had some dumb rule to tell you to wait a week to make sure you were really interested.\n\nShe expected you to keep texting her and giving her attention while she made you wait.\n\nIt's a childish game that people play until they realize that adults can be perfectly fine with no contact with someone they haven't even met.\n\nNTA", "> I reached out to try and reconfirm. She let me know she\u2019s been busy and was going to be busy all week.\n\n>She lets me know that me not texting her all week was a red flag and she was no longer interested in meeting as I didn\u2019t prioritize her.\n\nNTA \n\nDont get into a relationship with anyone like this unless you love being miserable", "NTA\nShe's playing games. She isn't willing to give you the same consideration and effort you give her, then complains you respected her \"being too busy\" and didn't try harder. Not worth your effort.", "Move on, nothing there. She was playing games, you were eliminated in an early round, which saves you from wasting time on her.\nYou're NTA here.", "Seems you dodged a bullet here. Seems she is one of those people who are playing stupid games. If you had texted her earlier, she would probably have complained like \"but I've told you blah blah\". Plus messaging works two ways, she could have dropped a short msg too if she wanted.\nNTA.", "NTA. \n\nI'd just put this down to miscommunication in her part and I'm assuming you're both likely very young and reasonably new to dating, so often everyone is a little too cautious or a little too expectant.", "Technically she said she was busy all week in terms of being delayed responding to you and couldnt meet up\n\nNow she follows up with you hadnt texted her all week which she never told you to stop texting her.  \n\nPeople calling this playing mind games\n\nEither way now you know", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Regardless, I say NTA, she said she was busy all week so you simply respected her time.", "NTA, she\u2019s playing games to see how much you wanna chase her. That\u2019s the only red flag I see here", "NTA - count yourself lucky to have learned this early and can avoid the pain of leaning it much later.", "Nta, you dodged a bullet", "NTA. She is showing major red flags. She said she was busy, you said you would give her the space and when to expect a response. If she didn't like that answer, she had plenty of time to tell you that she would prefer to keep talking over that time. She could also have reached out to you. The idea that she expects you to reach out when she is unwilling to do the same is nutty. Congrats on missing out on a bunch of BS!", "> I had been texting this girl back and forth off a dating site\n\nI don't know how long you were texting, but this is why it's good to schedule the first meeting as soon as possible. The more texting there is before meeting for the first time, the more chance for disappointment.", "NTA - wow, you dodged a bullet with someone who is clearly narcissistic. \n\nThere isn\u2019t much point in replying other than to say, \u201cgood luck with that\u201d.
