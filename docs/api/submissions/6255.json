We clearly defined rules beforehand:\n- no drinking\n- only stay at the house we agreed on\n-home by 2\n\nI thought my daughter should be grown up enough to handle those rules but apparently I was mistaken. At Scott 01:30 she called me to tell me that her friends wanted to go to another party and she joined them. Now said friends had vanished, she was at a house party where she felt unsafe and wanted me to pick her up. She was at a quite remote place, in no way she would have been home at 2. Also, she was clearly intoxicated.\n\nI believe in consequences so I refused, told her that this will be a learning experience and to figure out how to get home - she is to old for rules so she doesn't need my coding anymore. She tried to argue but I just ended the call and went to bed.\n\nNext morning I woke up to several aggressive-threatening messages from by ex-wife who had apparently agreed to pick her up instead (against the custody agreement). Daughter is staying with her and refusing to leave (also against the agreement).\n\nI don't believe there was any real danger and just had to show her that rules exist for a reason. My ex seems to think different.

And implying that her mother is doing something wrong - and against the custody order - by picking up her minor child in the middle of the night when you refused?

Even to one that has you never get to see her again?  \n\nYeah.  YTA.  This wasn't tough love, this was being idiotic and dangerous, especially in this day and age, towards your young daughter.

Your daughter. \n\nThink about it. Why did you have those rules? Was it to keep her safe? Or was it to feel good about the power of making rules?\n\nWhen your daughter is telling you she is feeling unsafe, she is unsafe. She was being mature by seeing the signs and asking for help knowing she would get into trouble later. But you left her in the bigger mess she was in.\n\nYou abandoned your teenage daughter, drunk, in the middle of the night, in a remote place where she's telling you she's unsafe.

So you chose to leave the kid on somewhere they might end up hurt / just dont feel comfortable to be at to teach her a lesson?

What if something happened to her when she was trying to reach home?\n\nConsequences could still exist after you took her out of a situation she feels uncomfortable being in. You could talk to her about this the next day. You did terribly wrong and i think you dont deserve to be mad at your ex for at least taking her out of possible danger.", "YTA you stranded your intoxicated child alone far from\nhome when she felt unsafe. Of course a teenager will push boundaries and mess up.  \n\nThis is how you handle this. You pick your kid up and barely say anything. Tell her you are angry and disappointed she didn\u2019t listen.

I\u2019m sure she knew how much she fucked up and would be in huge trouble, but was looking to you for help and you let her down. You think that nothing bad would happen to her, but how do you actually know because you never went there. \n\nThere was a news story that happened a few years ago where a mother refused to let her daughter into their house because she broke curfew. The mom thought that this would be a learning experience for her to never break curfew and thought their neighborhood was safe. Instead, her daughter was kidnapped by some sicko. She was raped and murdered. Luckily, your ex was able to pick up your daughter and nothing bad happened.", "Seriously? YTA in so many ways. Priority no. 1 is to get your daughter home safe.

She knew she was drunk, she trusted you by asking for help meaning picking her up but you let her down and she called her mom and she picked her up.

Your 16 year old daughter was left alone at a house where she was unsafe and you left her there?!?! If you want to punish her for breaking your rules you get her home safely and ground her.

Your daughter called you bc she felt unsafe and you hung up on her?!  Wow.  Yea, you taught her a lesson - you care more about your rules than her safety.  She messed up but that\u2019s what teens do.  Your job as a parent is to help her learn but balance that w caring for her.  There was time to punish her for breaking the rules once she was safe.

Any number of horrible things could have happened to your daughter and you obviously weren't concerned for her at all, all you care about are your rules and your custody agreement.

She's 16 bub. SIXTEEN!!! And she trusted you enough to call you when she needed to. She could have been SA'd, hurt, maimed even killed. And that would be on you.

Punish her at home for breaking the rules but the only thing you are currently teaching her is that she can\u2019t count on you to help her if she is ever in an unsafe situation. Hopefully no one tried to take advantage of a minor girl who was inebriated and unsure of her location or friends. How would you feel if that happened? I\u2019m sure that\u2019s one of the many reasons your ex is livid. I work with teens. They need guidance but they also need to feel safe.

At Scott 01:30 she called me to tell me that her friends wanted to go to another party and she joined them. Now said friends had vanished, she was at a house party where she felt unsafe and wanted me to pick her up. She was at a quite remote place, in no way she would have been home at 2. Also, she was clearly intoxicated.\n\nI believe in consequences so I refused, told her that this will be a learning experience and to figure out how to get home - she is to old for rules so she doesn't need my coding anymore. She tried to argue but I just ended the call and went to bed.\n\nNext morning I woke up to several aggressive-threatening messages from by ex-wife who had apparently agreed to pick her up instead (against the custody agreement).

Well let me tell you I was if you feel unsafe call mom or one of your adults. Her adult safety group is me my dad my ex my exes adult kids and any of us would drop everything and go get her if she felt unsafe somewhere.", "YTA. There are a whole pile of people here to tell you why, so I\u2019ll just say this: if a man deliberately chooses not to help his child when she is in danger, he may be a sperm donor but he is no kind of father at all.", "FLAMING YTA.\n\nJesus she is 16 she is suppose to test boundaries and make mistakes. As her GD parent you are suppose to help her navigate those mistakes so she and read this one carefully STAYS THE F ALIVE. \n\nThe fact that you didn\u2019t even realize she never came home.

You absolutely put her in danger and you should be ashamed of yourself! \n\nEven though she made a mistake, you should have been proud that she was at least able to recognize that she was not in a safe situation and she called you instead of trying to hide it. That was the smart thing to do. And you let her stay in danger. \n\nHave you ever read the SA statistics for your country? Have you read the statistics for situations like this?

She can\u2019t go to you for guidance or trust.", "YTA, \n\nAnd btw, your custody agreement went out the window when you decided to leave your daughter in a place she felt unsafe.

I hope she does take this as a learning lesson, cuts you off completely (she and your ex), and you get to live in worry for the rest of your life if she is okay. \n\nThis was irresponsible to the highest degree ON YOUR PART.

Do you even like your child?", "Yta not only are you the asshole but you possibly left her in a dangerous situation. Give her consequences when she gets home. Don\u2019t abandon her safety.

And a terrible parent. Perhaps you were intoxicated?", "So your 16 year old daughter was intoxicated in a scary environment, alone because her friends vanished, and she reached out to someone she should ALWAYS be able to count on to keep her safe?

She did the right thing and called you.  If you punish her she won\u2019t call you next time and could end up dead if she gets in the car with a drunk driver, hoping they can get her home.\n\nMy mom would have freaked if I called her for help, and I ended up getting rides home from drunk friends and I got lucky but it could have easily gone the other way.", "Dude, major YTA. That's a quick way to get your daughter raped. You pick her up, then ground her and do no party allowance for a while since she broke your trust right off the bat. Leaving her around strangers when drunk leads to SVU episodes.", "YTA. There are two beliefs that abusive people hold: 1. I have the right to make demands of others. 2. I have the right to punish people who don\u2019t comply with my demands. \n\nYou exhibited/continue to defend these beliefs despite placing your minor child in danger of rape, death, or alcohol poisoning. \n\nI\u2019m thankful your ex-wife was able to escape you.

Great... she tells you that she feels unsafe, and you say, fuck you.. deal with the rape.  \n\nYTA  .... you are also a terrible parent that just taught your daughter to never trust you again.

You'll be asking yourself why she won't talk to you anymore by the time she's 21 if you don't apologize sincerely, never do it again, and shut the hell up about the custody agreement.

You left your minor daughter in a situation she didn't feel comfortable in to punish her? She trusted you enough to call even though she knew she went against your rules, and that she would be in trouble, she asked for help because she didn't feel safe. And you basically told her \"sucks to be you.\" Kids make mistakes. This was a wonderful learning and growth opportunity, but you squandered it. \n\nYou should have gone and gotten her, let her sleep it off, then discuss how in breaking your rule, she found herself in an unsafe situation.

You just proved you are not gonna be there for her if she needs help. YTA YTA YTA!!", "YTA- I want OP to re-read what he wrote and try to figure out how he\u2019s not the AH in this situation. Such a moron", "YTA, make sure she\u2019s safe and sound at home first, then you give her a consequence.", "YTA - she trusted you enough to call you when she was in trouble but you turned your back on her.

OP, you blew it!", "You left your drunk, young daughter all alone in an unfamiliar place to teach her a lesson?!?!! The only lesson she learned is that she can\u2019t rely on you when she\u2019s scared or needs help. She knows she screwed up and was probably scared to call you but did so because of how scared she was for her physical safety. \n\nYour daughter was a predator\u2019s dream last night - drunk, young and alone.

It is STILL your duty as a parent to guide her. My god, in hope for   her sake that she NEVER needs to rely on your help. I hope for YOUR sake that she will still want to talk to you when something bad happens to her. Please be a better parent.", "I don\u2019t understand the thought process here. He gave her rules to I assume keep her safe. She broke them, putting her in danger, and as punishment just let her stay in danger?", "YTA sooooooo much. What the actual\u2026.   Never ever leave your child or even an adult on their own like this. They had the guts to call you and needed your help. She is only 16. Gosh only knows what could have happened to her. You pick them up and discuss it the next day. Sorry but you are an awful parent and person.", "YTA \n\nMy jaw dropped open. \n\nYour teenage daughter called you for help at 2am drunk and saying she may be in danger because she is in unfamiliar territory with people she doesn\u2019t know\u2026and YOU REFUSED TO HELP HER???? \n\nWow Op! Listen, you can talk to her about rules, dole out consequences etc. AFTER she is safe! Way to show her some love! \n\nLeaving her in a potentially dangerous situation with other drunk teenagers far away with no chaperones is the worst imaginable situation possible! Thank goodness your wife stepped up!", "YTA so as punishment you left your 16-year-old daughter who is intoxicated at a party where she doesn't know anybody maybe get sexually assaulted kidnapped murdered you don't know and decide to go to bed.

I\u2019d pay to listen to the judge chew you out.", "I hope your wife takes you back to the court and gets the custody agreement changed. You basically abandoned your child. Way to go. YTA.", "YTA I hope she and her mom get a restraining order against you.", "YTA. \n\nYou missed a golden opportunity. Instead of picking her up, MAKING SURE SHE WAS SAFE, and then addressing everything else later, you chose to leave a minor in an unsafe situation. Where alcohol was involved?  \n\nShe trusted you enough to call you and ask for help. And she was honest about her situation. Good luck ever getting that back.", "YTA and you just lost all of your daughters trust as her parent. She trusted you enough to be honest and admit she was scared and went against your rules. Most if not all teenagers go against their parents rules. She tried to be responsible and safe and reached out to you and you just left her. Good luck repairing this relationship", "YTA, even if your kids make a mistake, when they call you asking for help and are in a vulnerable position you freaking help. You, sir are a horrible parent.\n\nYou pick your daughter or son up when they call you in an instance like this. You get them home safely and then you discuss consequences.\n\nMy kids were always told to call me if they felt unsafe, if they needed a ride, were drunk, their ride was drunk or they just felt that things were off where they were.\nThey could even pretend that I called them and said that they had to come home right away as an excuse to get out of something uncomfortable.\n\nBe a safe place for your children.", "YTA. You told your minor daughter to figure out how to get home on her own, on fucking New Years Eve, objectively the most dangerous night of the year on the road, when she was intoxicated and asking for help. How would you feel if she had gotten into a car with a drunk driver or driven drunk herself and had or caused a fatal accident?\n\n\"Child, you can call me at any time day or night and I will pick you up\" is parenting a teenager 101. You failed. Your daughter won't forget this. Hopefully she and Mom are contacting Mom's lawyer now to go back to court to amend the custody agreement.", "YTA so your punishment for your teenage daughter for being a dumb teenager is to let her feel like she's in an unsafe environment? Hmm no wonder she doesn't want to come homr you asshole, you are UNRELIABLE. Your daughter could have been ASSAULTED and I mean in ANYWAY and it would have been because YOU FAILED as a parent. I hope your ex wife files for full custody considering you thought this was an appropriate punishment", "YTA. The one time parents should always help their kids is when they call are in drinking/unknown situation! What you just showed your daughter is that She can not depend on you when she needs you!", "YTA it could have been dealt with once she was in a safe place. You were too rigidly fixated on rules from the ones she broke to your wife violating a custody agreement in order to keep your daughter safe.", "Wow. YTA. I\u2019m 35, married and a mom myself, and if I ever called my dad in the middle of the night asking for a ride because I felt unsafe, he\u2019d be dressed and on his way in 3 minutes.

She made a bad decision and now she knows she can\u2019t count on her father.", "You left your drunk teenager at a random, unsafe house.\n\nI'm pretty sure this is \"losing all custody rights\" territory. \n\nYTA.", "YTA. Your intoxicated teenage daughter wasn't sure where she was, felt she was in danger, surrounded by other intoxicated people, and was on her own. Do you know how lucky she is to be safe? To not have been assaulted, drugged, kidnapped, trafficked?\n\nThe world is a dangerous place for teens, and women, and she's both. She was in the center of every horror story of a kidnapping victim, and her parent told her 'You did this, you're on your own.'\n\nQuite frankly: do you not love your child? That's not hyperbole. Your actions say you do not care about her.\n\nThank goodness your ex wife was able to help her.", "Hard YTA. I have nothing but insulting nicknames for you. Your head is up your ass and you like what you see.", "Dude, getting abandoned by friends and feeling unsafe IS the consequence of her actions. Now all she's learned is she can't trust you when she's in danger. YTA.", "WTF. YTA. You left your teenage daughter drunk and alone at a party?!? Discipline in the morning, but take care of her at night.", "YTA So she's at a place without her friends, feels unsafe and you refuse to pick her up. You know you're responsible for taking care of her until she's 18 right? So instead of doing what a parent is supposed to do, you leave her at a place where she's vulnerable, to teach her a frickin lesson. Do you realize kids get raped and killed every day in the world. And your holier than thou bs about your ex and against the custody agreement is a bunch of crap. Try walking your story backwards between your lawyer and her lawyer and see who wins. I guarantee it wont be you.", "YTA honestly OP the only thing you just taught your daughter is if she is ever in an unsafe position, you won\u2019t help her. Look you have every right to be mad that she broke your trust and didn\u2019t follow the rules. And you have every right to go pick her up at the party and ground her and have a discussion about trust and preventing her from parties for the foreseeable future. But you left her in an unsafe position. The only thing you taught her is that you don\u2019t care if something were to happen to her. I hope she didn\u2019t get assaulted. I hope your daughter is safe. Only thing you just taught her is that her dad could care less if some guy assaulted her or she was murdered. Because she made a foolish mistake at 16.", "YTA- why is this even a question? \n\n\u2018Against the custody agreement\u2019\u2026 good luck keeping any custody after this. You blatantly left your daughter in a dangerous situation- you are a terrible parent. I would go any pick ANYONE up that needed a ride at that time, even if they weren\u2019t in the dangerous situation your daughter was in. \n\nA friend missed a call from her 16 yo son at 1am. She was woken at 3am by the cops banging on her door because after he couldn\u2019t get hold of her for a ride, he jumped in the car with an 18 yo friend who wrecked the car and killed both the passengers, her son included. And this was a Parent fully willing to pick up her kid, she just slept through the call. She tried her best to prevent this situation.. then there\u2019s awful parents like you who don\u2019t make any effort, but are just lucky to not be burying a kid.", "YTA. So instead of being a mature adult and dealing with the consequences after your underage daughter is home and safe. You decided to leave a drunk sixteen year old to find her own way home. \"I don't believe there was any real danger\" Yeah and I didn't believe there was any danger in getting drunk with my boyfriend and then bam I got sexually assaulted. You need to apologize to your daughter, ex wife, and whole family for being so dumb and being so lucky nothing bad happened.", "YTA", "Oh. My. God. Your daughter called you saying she felt unsafe and you said go on and take your punishment? You\u2019re the worst dad on the planet.", "There was a 13 year old who kept sneaking out the window at night so her parents decided to teach her a lesson and locked her out.

I can\u2019t remember their names.", "Your underage daughter felt unsafe and called you to pick her up even though she knew she\u2019d be in trouble. That\u2019s how unsafe she felt. And you LEFT HER THERE?! I can\u2019t even begin to tell you how much of an AH you are. \n\nYea rules exist but she can be punished later. Being left alone drunk underage at a party is not an appropriate punishment. How do you know there was no real danger? \n\nYTA of the highest degree. You should not have custody of her.", "YTA. Why not pick her up and give her consequences in the safety of her own home? She's 16. She's going to break rules and make mistakes. Leaving her in a situation where she could have been assaulted is not how you handle it. No judge is going to side with you on this. You made an irresponsible decision. Your ex had your daughter's best interests in mind.", "YTA. She most likely didn\u2019t learn anything from this situation other than that she can\u2019t count on you. This is just bad parenting all around. You were more concerned with revenge (because that\u2019s definitely what this is even if you want to convince yourself otherwise) than the safety of your child. If a teenager risks getting in trouble because they feel unsafe they are\u2026definitely in an unsafe situation.", "YTA. Maybe the biggest one I\u2019ve ever seen. I just can\u2019t even wrap my head around how you leave your daughter in such a vulnerable position and GO TO SLEEP. What is wrong with you?", "YTA \ud83d\udcaf. I have teenagers and our rule is for them to always call me if they feel unsafe somewhere, night or day no matter what \u201ccondition\u201d they are in. I would much rather make sure they are safe and get medical attention if they need it then \u201cteach them a lesson\u201d by potentially letting something happen to them.", "So, either this isn't real or you are  just honestly the worst. Assuming this is real, 1. You are the AH, 2. Your daughter will NEVER trust you in a time of need again and 3. You are kissing a long term relationship with her goodbye. WTF she was intoxicated and IN DANGER you're lucky something TERRIBLE didn't happen to her (not that you'd know because, as I said, she'll never trust you again).", "Holy shit. YTA. So many horrific things could have happened to your daughter and you didn\u2019t go get her! Rules like that are meant to protect young girls from being in dangerous situations, but you left her in a dangerous situation as a \u201cconsequence\u201d for breaking them? What is the point of your rules if you don\u2019t care what happens to her??? As far as I\u2019m concerned, your authority is meaningless because you have proven they are arbitrary and your priority is control rather than her safety.\n\nYour daughter trusted you to love her and help her when she was in trouble instead of trying to hide it, and you decimated that trust. If I were your ex-wife, I would immediately start looking for a way to remove your custody after this stunt.", "Congrats. Your custody agreement just got a much needed revamp. \n\nOf course you go pick up your child when they call for you. Unless you're trying to be the star of the next true crime documentary?

Look, you reap what you sow, and you\u2019re showing your kid that she doesn\u2019t matter enough for you to help her. 16 year olds can learn, but you\u2019ve got to give them the safe space to do so. Don\u2019t be surprised if your daughter wants nothing to do with you for a very long time.", "I have a rule with my kids you can call me any time any where and I will pick you up or pay for a cab home, no questions asked.  \n\nWhy because the goal is to get them home safe.\n\nWhat is wrong with you dont get your daughter anymore you are an unsafe person for her to be around and a disgusting human being.   YTA a massive gaping asshole.\n\nHow do you go to sleep knowing your daughter is in an unsafe environment.   \n\nNOT A GIRL DAD", "YTA of epic proportions. You can stand your ground without putting your *16 year old daughter* in a vulnerable position. You fucked up big time - if I were you I\u2019d apologize profusely and try to regain her trust before she gets into major trouble.", "YTA. WTF. Your daughter made the very adult decision to call her parent for help, knowing she was breaking rules and will be in trouble for it. And you responded with leaving her stranded in an unsafe place, with no way home in the middle of the night. \n\nCongratulations, you have now shown your daughter you can\u2019t be relied on when she\u2019s in trouble. You are a terrible parent, apologize and do better.", "HUGE AH.  Your daughter is a teenager.  Yes, she broke the rules and gave in to peer pressure.  But you are the adult. You are supposed to protect her.  She called asking for help and protection and you abandoned her to \"teach her a lesson\" rather than pick her up and give her an appropriate punishment later when she would be safe at home and sober.   Instead you left your drunk daughter alone at a house party with strangers.  This is not father of the year material.", "Are you joking????!!!!! You cant possibly be serious. Youre the AHole 100%. You could have picked her up and punished her at home, instead you left her to fend for herself in a situation she, a drunk 16yr old, was able to determine was unsafe. Good lord. You shouldnt be a parent.", "YTA, and your behavior makes you an unfit parent. An intoxicated 16 year-old, abandoned by her friends, at a remote place, at 1:30 AM, according to you, deserves the 'learning experience' of being raped or worse? I think her mother, your ex-wife, should sue for sole custody. The judge needs to hear about this, I hope your wife has already called her lawyer. Your behavior was abandoning and endangering to your minor child. She does not seem safe with the custody arrangement as it is.", "YTA, are you f-ing kidding me? You left a young girl who was drunk on her own at a remote house party? Do you not watch Dateline or listen to Crime Junkies? Yes, she deserved to be punished, but how would you feel if she had been raped or worse? Get your head out of your ass, Dad! Also they should take you to court and re-arrange custody.", "YTA. Please call the court and report your ex for breaking the agreement. Please. When they find out what happened, you won\u2019t have any custody anymore. \n\nIf my kid ever called me scared, drunk, stranded, or any combo of those, I would be there immediately.

Now she knows she cannot count on one of her parents if she is ever in a jam.  Good job, Dad.", "YTA and a terrible parent. Your kid felt they were in danger and rang you for help despite knowing they had gotten themselves in the danger. That takes a lot of trust. You broke all of that trust and now your kid knows you won\u2019t be there for her when she fucks up. Good job Dad, really nailed it on the parenting there. Hope she wasn\u2019t raped.", "YTA. OMG. You are an absolute failure of a parent.", "Moderators, please check is this post is real. There is no way this is real, no one is this stupid. I could see if OP couldn\u2019t go because he was drunk or high, but him saying he made a sober, conscious (assuming he was sober) decision\u2026I just don\u2019t buy it with this post.\n\nIf this is confirmed to be real, YTA obviously.", "Wtf? Dude you are such an AH. As a parent, our primary goal is for our kids to be safe. Yeah she didn\u2019t make good choices but all you taught her was that being right is more important than you supporting her. I guarantee she will continue to make choices, some good and some bad but will never rely on you again. \n\nI tell my teenagers all the time that no matter what choice they make they can ALWAYS call me and I will ALWAYS come for them. Yeah we\u2019ll talk about critical thinking and decision making afterwards but first I get you safe and fed. \n\nYTA and you\u2019re gonna so high on your moral horse that you don\u2019t even realize the damage you\u2019ve done.", "YTA. Dude, you WANT her to call you when she\u2019s in trouble. \n\nFar better would have had the rules you need to have, define the consequences of rule-breaking, AND most importantly let her know that even with those rules, if she calls you\u2019ll be there for her.\n\nIt might not be too late. A huge heartfelt apology and discussion might bail you out.", "YTA and now you\u2019ve taught your daughter that you are not a safe person to come to for help when she makes a mistake.

My kids can\u2019t break any rules and if they feel unsafe I would be there. She is calling knowing she is going to be in trouble.

I hope you enjoy wondering \"why doesn't my daughter want to have a relationship with me\" also your notes about \"against agreement\" is total bullshit.

There was no \"real danger\"? \n\nNewsflash, sexual assault is a very real potential danger in that situation. And even more likely: getting in a car with someone who shouldn't be driving and getting in an accident, because you left her with no options and 16 year olds aren't great decisionmakers even when sober. So is trying to walk home, getting lost, and depending on where you live, getting in a dangerous situation due to cold/weather. Getting desperate and accepting a ride from a stranger. Etc etc. \n\nMy parents had an amnesty policy for exactly this kind of situation: if we ever went out and got into some kind of situation where we needed to get home--if the person who was supposed to drive was drinking, if we were drinking, if we felt like we were unsafe at a party or unsafe taking a ride from whoever we came with-- we could call them and they would come and get us and we wouldn't get in trouble. Because they would rather we do something stupid like get drunk and *call them for help* rather than try to hide it out of fear of getting in trouble and do something or stay somewhere that wasn't safe. You just taught your daughter that she can't rely on you and that your rules are more important to you than her safety. Fortunately, it seems like she has one supportive parent she can trust to help her when she feels unsafe--your ex. And she's 16, so if she doesn't want to see you anymore, a judge is almost certainly going to let her decide that. Good job!", "YTA. I was scared for her safety reading this. I'm glad she's OK.

AH.", "\"you got yourself into the dangerous situation, you can get yourseld out even though your under the influence.\" I'm sure it didnt kill her to have to call you and Tell you she broke all the rules knowing she's gonna get in trouble.

You can have a calm discussion at another time, because your child is home safe and alive!

Do you really want her to be in a drunk driving accident or raped so that you could prove your point?

This agreement he seems to hold so holy sure is out the door for one where he will be lucky if he gets her at all.", "This! This needs to be higher up in the comments. OP destroyed their daughter's trust and she is well old enough to choose who she wants to live with, custody agreement or not. YTA very much.", "This.  But my favorite part of the story is when he went to BED and woke up to angry messages from his ex.  So his daughter called, told him she was in a vulnerable situation and he blew her off.  That\u2019s bad enough. But then he left his phone somewhere where he couldn\u2019t hear it and then proceeded to sleep.  I hope he slept well.  OP good luck in family court.", "It's just rape, not date rape.  Date rape makes it seem less serious.", "Is it just me or can this lead to op losing any remaining custody of his daughter", "You are so right, he is TA. When my sons were teenagers I told them if they were drunk, felt unsafe or their ride was drunk or high to call me and I would come get them, any place, any time.
