They showed you, they weren't interested. But suddenly they see a slide and feel entitled.... Hell no.", "NTA \n\nIf the kids wanted to be a part of the big party they should have come to the smaller one. \n\nAlso, you have 0 obligations to invite people who are not friends with your kid.", "NTA  \n\n\nYou don't have to invite the whole neighborhood to your daughter's birthday party.  Frankly, at young ages older kids can be intimidating and could have even ruined the experience for your daughter and her cousins.", "NTA\n\nHow much time do they spend playing with your daughter?  I'm guessing none.  \n\nThey weren't interested last year.. why would you invite them this year.  They aren't her friends.", "NTA - Don't think twice about this. It was a family party. Do their parents invite you to their family parties? Stop being a people pleaser.", "They said they didn't want to go to a little kids party. They don't invite your daughter to their events.

Kindly I am saying they weren't interested in your daughter or helping her celebrate her birthday. They were interested in everything you had there. It sounds like there is an age gap which may make it more understandable. You made the right decision in inviting family to help celebrate her birthday.", "NTA at ALL. They chose their stance the previous year, when none of them showed up (which is kind of a terrible thing to do, by the way. At least attend out of politeness??)", "They are just neighbors, they don't have any relationship with your daughter and they don't get the right to eat her birthday cake.  If you had chosen to invite them, it would have been kind, but you are not unkind for not inviting them.  Don't lose an ounce of sleep over this.\n\nNTA", "NTA - they definitely were trying to use you without giving back. They didn\u2019t invite your daughter to any of their events, why are you obligated to invite them? Especially if you\u2019re well Past capacity.", "NTA\n\nI wouldn't feel bad at all if I were you. They don't want to be there for your daughter anyway. They made that clear the year before. They only want to go to the cool party.", "They don't invite your daughter to their events, and they chose not to attend the party you invited them to last year.  You did your best, and you don't owe them anything.  NTA. I can't imagine anyone thinking otherwise, frankly.", "ESH your daughter is 3. she was 2 last year.  really she was too small to be friends with any of the kids. but in a couple of years she will be. so keep it civil with your neighbors and friendly with the kids.", "100", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I do not like people like this.", "Absolutely none", "NTA- the kids probably saw the bouncy castle and pool and wanted to do that not actually celebrate your kids birthday. My mom used to invite every kid in my class (Including my childhood bully) cause she never wanted to be the mom to exclude any kids. It was extremely kind on her part but didn\u2019t stop the bully as soon as I went back to school. You made sure the party was all about your daughter as it always should be and you should never second guess that.", "I do have issues with that ..", "And that is ok! You can work on that!

Stop being nice to parents who aren\u2019t nice to you and your kid. Match the energy, effort and vibes that you get from your neighbors.", "You did nothing wrong.  You tried last year; it didn't work.  And you're not invited to the neighbors' events.  NTA", "NTA. They don\u2019t give a toss about your kid, they already showed you how they felt. Your kid deserves to have good people around her.", "You threw your kid an awesome party. Stop fretting what other people *might* think about it. It's a waste of time and energy.
