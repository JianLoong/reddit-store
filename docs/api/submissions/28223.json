I also paid for all of his expense while he was looking for a job (which took nearly two months). Even after he got his job I\u2019d be sending him at least a couple hundred every month. I didn\u2019t ask him to pay any of it back at the time because we were still together. We recently broke up a few weeks ago. It was his initiative because uase he didn\u2019t want to move back to the place where I\u2019m from, even though for our entire relationship he\u2019s stressed that he would never make me move and loved where we were at.\n\nAnyways.. I\u2019ve recently lent him around $500 in total.

His payday is tomorrow, and now he\u2019s not sure if he can cover his rent and pay me back. If I told him he could wait, he wouldn\u2019t be able to pay me back again for another 3 weeks.

Not a month later. He seemed shocked when I said this, and said he would even though he isn\u2019t sure he\u2019ll be able to pay rent. \n\nI could wait a month before trying to move into an apartment. My daughter and I have been living with my parents since he left because at the time I couldn\u2019t afford to live on my own and my ex left me with a lot of debt. I really don\u2019t want to wait any longer. \n\nI\u2019m also worried this might effect our coparenting relationship.\n\nHelp keep the sub engaging!\n\n#Don\u2019t downvote assholes!\n\nDo upvote interesting posts!\n\n [Click Here For Our Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules) and [Click Here For Our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\n\n##Subreddit Announcements\n\n###[Happy Anniversary, AITA!](https://new.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15vlv9g/almost_better_than_a_double_rainbow_celebrating/)\n\n###[The Asshole Universe is Expanding, Again: Introducing Another New Sister Subreddit!](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/128nbp3/the_asshole_universe_is_expanding_again/)\n\nFollow the link above to learn more\n\n---\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
