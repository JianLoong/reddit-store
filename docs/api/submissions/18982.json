I still live at home with my parents, who are extremely controlling. \n\nAll my friends have left the country and so I am on my own a lot. Most of my time is spent at home, at work or going on solo walks. I don't drink. I don't go to the gym or play sports anymore. I don't have hobbies outside the house. I haven't dated anyone for 7 years. All and all a very uninteresting life. My one solace is being outdoors in nature and walking. \n\nMy parents aren't happy with this. They think women should not go on walks by themselves as it is dangerous (in their words). I know it would be better to ease their concerns if I had someone to go on walks with but I don't. \n\nMy mum has been trying to get me to put \"Share My Location\" on my phone with her for years. I understand that she worries about my safety. However, the big problem for me is I know it is not just about my safety. She will use it to become my full time stalker. I know this because she has my Dad share his location with her and visa versa. She sits and stares at her screen all day and will say things like \"Oh your father has just left tennis\", \"Oh your father has just arrived at work\", \"Oh your father is leaving the pub\". Not that I have anything to hide, but it is the one boundary I have held on to and I have been so proud of myself for not caving. \n\nToday's Events.\nToday I decided that I would take a trip up the coast and go for a walk along the sea. I told my parents about my plans (10:30am). My mum asked that I call her and keep in touch. Once I got there (2 pm), I called her and told her where I was. I also told her what walk and route I would be taking. I didn't tell her when I would be home (but she also didn't ask). I also didn't message to say I was on my way home. \n\nMy parents were furious when I arrived back (8pm). My dad told my that I no longer had a say and that it was mandatory for me to have a tracker on my phone. I told him that I had done everything asked of me: I had called, explained where I was going etc. I also said they could have called me if they were concerned about my whereabouts.\n\nSo as a result, I have been punished. The car that I drive is technically my dad's, and so he has taken the keys away. He says that I can buy my own car or grant him and my mum access to my tracking information.They said they would never do this to me, hold the fact they bought the car over my head. Also, it makes no sense for me to buy a new car now. I am at the final stage of a graduate recruitment process and if I am successful, I will be moving to London in September. However, I need to survive between now and then and without a car the little life I have is impossible.\n\nSo, AITA for refusing to let them put a tracker on my phone when their concern is my safety? Any thoughts would be greatly appreciated.", "created_utc": 1685915406, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/140rnfs/aita_for_refusing_to_let_my_parents_put_a_tracker/", "score": 80, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
