I still live at home with my parents, who are extremely controlling. \n\nAll my friends have left the country and so I'm on my own a lot. Most of my time is spent at home, at work or going on solo walks. I don't drink. I don't go to the gym or play sports anymore. I don't have hobbies outside the house. I haven't dated anyone for 7 years. All and all a very uninteresting life. My one solace is being outdoors in nature and walking. \n\nMy parents aren't happy with this. They think women shouldn't go on walks by themselves as it is dangerous (in their words). I know it would be better to ease their concerns if I had someone to go on walks with but I don't. \n\nMy mum has been trying to get me to put \"Share My Location\" on my phone with her for years. I understand that she worries about my safety. However, the big problem for me is I know it is not just about my safety. She'll use it to become my stalker. I know this because she has my Dad share his location with her and visa versa. She sits and stares at her screen and will say things like \"Oh your father has just left tennis\", \"Oh your father has just arrived at work\", \"Oh your father is leaving the pub\". Not that I've anything to hide, but it is the one boundary I've held on to and I have been so proud of myself for not caving. \n\nToday's Events.\n\nToday I decided that I'd take a trip up the coast and go for a walk along the sea. I told my parents about my plans (10:30am). My mum asked that I call her and keep in touch. Once I got there (2 pm), I called her and told her where I was. I also told her what walk and route I would be taking. I didn't tell her when I would be home (but she also didn't ask). I also didn't message to say I was on my way home. \n\nMy parents were furious when I arrived back (8pm). My dad told my that I no longer had a say and that it was mandatory for me to have a tracker on my phone. I told him that I had done everything asked of me: I had called, explained where I was going etc. I also said they could have called me if they were concerned about my whereabouts.\n\nSo as a result, I've been punished. The car that I drive is technically my dad's and so he has taken the keys away. He says that I can buy my own car or grant them access to my tracking information.They said they would never do this to me, hold the fact they bought the car over my head. Also, it makes no sense for me to buy a new car now. I'm at the final stage of a graduate recruitment process and if I am successful, I will be moving to London in September. However, I need to survive between now and then and without a car the little life I have is impossible.\n\nSo, AITA for refusing to let them put a tracker on my phone when their concern is my safety?\n\nEdit: My dad hasn't told me that he has taken the keys.

It really did not encourage a wandering spirit in the kids, but I saw that the kids could navigate the neighborhood and make their way back home ALONE. \n\nIt's no wonder why our younger generation still lives at home.

Lived there for 4 years and was never mugged or attacked, the flat never got burgled, and no one randomly offered me drugs as I walked down the street.\n\nMy biggest regret is that because my job was very physical and not very well paid, I was knackered by the weekends and careful with my money and so probably didn't take as much advantage of visiting other areas of the city. Now I live back out in the countryside and a \u00a335 train ticket puts me off going back regularly.\n\nSome of it was luck, like finding nice strangers to live with. But I would recommend you start doing your research on the city NOW. Look up flat shares (I found my place through SpareRoom) so you know where you can afford to live, work out how you could get to your planned workplace, look at what amenities are in the area, and then if your parents start to draw the net tighter you'll be able to make the jump without going in completely blind."]}
