We visit her Mom (F54) for dinner once a month.\n\nLast weekend we went over to her Mom's house for dinner. As we were leaving, her Mom hands me a wrapped box. An early Christmas present! I open it to find the ugliest. sweater. I. have. ever. seen. It's bright red with green stripes and gold jingle bells. The sweater literally jingles as you walk. On the front is a huge picture of a cartoon reindeer. The collar and sleeves are covered in white, frilly ruffles. The sweater is hideous and childish.\n\nI wear black ripped jeans, spiked collars, and band tees. I wear black eyeliner and my dark hair covers my eyes. I wear platform converse and black nail polish. I do not wear brightly coloured Christmas sweaters.\n\nI smiled politely and thanked her for the gift, knowing that I could NEVER bring myself to even TRY ON the sweater. My girlfriend and I went home. When I got to our room, I reopened the box to shove the sweater in the back of the closet where I hopefully wouldn't have to see it for a long time. As I picked it up, a paper fell off of the bottom of the box. It was the receipt.\n\nMy mother-in-law probably got it gift wrapped at the store. Maybe the employee left it in the gift receipt by accident. The sweater was rather expensive. I knew that at the store she got it at I could return the sweater for store credit.\n\nI returned the sweater the next day, without the knowledge of my girlfriend. I planned to use the store credit to buy her some things she'd been wanting. I was low on money, and had been stressing about Christmas presents. This would be the perfect opportunity to be able to afford some nice gifts for her. I bought the gifts and got them wrapped.\n\nWhen I got home, my girlfriend reminded me of a Christmas party that her mother was hosting in a few days. Every year, her mother hosts a HUGE party. All of my girlfriend's family and friends were going to be there.\n\nShe suggests I wear the sweater. Some sort of negative expression must cross my face, because she asks me what's wrong. I explain to her that I returned the sweater with the receipt I found.\n\nHer face drops.\n\nOur conversation went something like this:\n\nGF: My mom bought that for you so that you could wear it to the party.\n\nOP: How was I supposed to know that was her intention? This is my first year going to the party. I don't know what kind of clothing I'm supposed to wear.\n\nGF: You could have asked. You're just going to wear something emo anyways.\n\nOP: Yeah, because that's my style. That's what I ALWAYS wear, and you and your family are going to have to get used to it.\n\nMy girlfriend is telling me to repurchase the sweater, but I don't have the money to do that. I don't want to return her gifts and I purchased some of them on sale so I literally can't.\n\nI don't think I'm in the wrong. I got gifted a sweater that I would NEVER wear, so I returned it so I could buy something nice for my girlfriend.

Mate, you're an adult! Ugly Christmas jumpers are not a fashion statement, they are *anti* fashion, *anti* style & just for fun. Clearly you're too wedded to being emo (which is why I assumed I'd read wrong & you were a teen). This was offensive to both your girlf & MIL & given you couldn't even wait till after Christmas I'd say you just saw \u00a3 signs when you realised it's value.", "you sound like the Darkness Dementia Raven Way girl who wrote a fanfic about her being a vampire and went to hogwarts and killed off her co-writer in the story tbh \ud83d\ude2d like you just give those vibes when you were describing yourself\n\n[this is what i\u2019m referring to](https://my-immortal.fandom.com/wiki/Ebony_Dark%27ness_Dementia_Raven_Way)", "YTA. You're fretting now because *you spent your MIL's money* on gifts for your girlfriend. You can return her gifts and rebuy the sweater. What you then spend on her gifts is then your money. \n\nThere's absolutely no harm in wearing an ugly sweater for a party, especially if you think of it like Christmas fancy dress/costume.\n\nLet's be honest. You're only playing up your emo aesthetic because you wanted to buy your girlfriend gifts basically for free. No way would only you receive \"an early Christmas present\" for no reason, and any reasonable person would be asking why they were given something early.\n\nIf you don't return the sweater and just go with your original plan of store credit (or have your girlfriend understand that you can't afford many/any gifts for her), then it won't be too long before you're dumped for blatantly disrespecting her mother like that, especially when she tried to include you in the party that she throws.\n\nTurning that argument with your girlfriend into a, \"You know how I dress! You have to learn to accept me!\" is nothing but a cheap manipulation tactic to try and hide how disrespectful and cheap *you are*, OP.", "YTA - I can\u2019t believe you never spoke with your gf about the sweater or asked why her mom would get you something that is clearly not your style.\n\nYour gf\u2019s mom seems to like you enough to include you in a fun tradition they have, not going along with the theme could negatively affect your relationship going forward, I\u2019d suck it up, get the sweater again and go to the party.", "This is what you should have done: \n\n1. Had an honest conversation with your gf about the sweater, because then she would have told you the purpose of the gift. \n\n2. When you realized it came with a receipt, went and bought yourself an ugly Christmas sweater that was more suited to your style. \n\nI understand if someone doesn't know you super well they can be way off base with a gift, which could likely be why the receipt was included. Any other occasion it would be fair game to swap the item for something more personally pleasing. If you communicated with your gf you would have easily found out that this was a different situation. \n\nIn no way was that sweater a ticket to get your gf \"free\" gifts, and that is what makes YTA.", "YTA. \n\nGetting gifted a christmas sweater like that is very clearly for an event -- not just shits and giggles of \"maybe he'll wear it on a random Thursday in June\". \n\nNot to mention when it comes to gifts given by your partner's family, you need to be in alignment with what your intention is for it. \n\nAnd while style is definitely something personal and not something you should *have* to ever alter, there is something to be said about understanding a dress code or doing something nice because it will endear her family to you.\n\nThis wasn't a hill to die on but you decided to make a mountain out of a molehill.", "YTA. It was a gift from your girlfriend's mother and you wouldn't even try it on because your all black aesthetic is more important than being polite? And you returned it without talking to your girlfriend when you knew there was a family function coming up?", "I don\u2019t think YTA for returning a gift. That\u2019s why the receipt is there. Usually a gift receipt shouldn\u2019t have the price on it though which is\u2026odd. \n\nBut ywbta if you didn\u2019t return some things and rebuy it to wear to the party. Everyone will know YTA. You\u2019ll have to answer questions about what happened to the sweater she bought you. To me I wouldn\u2019t want to make that many waves", "NAH, I am completely astounded by these answers. Unless OP left it out intentionally, there is no mention that this huge Christmas party is an UGLY SWEATER party. Which is a thing, at least in the US. But doesn\u2019t seem to be the theme of this party.\n\nIf you give a gift and the receipt is in the box (regardless of how it got there, I have no idea why OP assumed it was an accident?) then the gift is yours to do with what you want. Including returning it.\n\nWhy in the hell would an adult have to wear a sweater they don\u2019t like to a party? Just because it was a gift, with no instructions?? This is insane.", "YTA and missed out on a chance to pair this sweater with the absolute most over-the-top gothy emo makeup and have the perfect Christmas card pictures for the rest of your life. \n\nSeriously, you could have a blast with this, and instead, you let your fragile ego win.", "I think YTA here, only because you didn't bother communicating with your GF before you returned it. And the fact that you already spent the money on other things just makes it worse. I mean, how were you planning to buy your GF a gift originally?\n\nI get that it's not your style or aesthetic, but communication solves a lot of hurt feelings, and you messed up here. \n\nAnd side note, don't use the term mother-in-law if you're not married.", "YTA- will the emo melt off your body if some color touches it? Will it light your skin aflame? What you did was rude.", "Yta\n\nSo common sense didn't chime in at any point,  telling you that you received an xmas present early for a reason, such as the party you knew was coming up? \n\nAnd the \"emo is my style, it's not just a phase, this is how I'll always be and you conformists just need to get used to my total non conformity\" is funny, and something that'll totally still be there when you grow up <s>.", "NAH\n\nNormally one should be able to return gifts of clothing that aren't to one's taste or wrong size or whatever.\n\nHowever, there is a fairly well known custom of the ugly Christmas sweater party. Unfortunately there seems to be a failure of communication in terms of what the very early Christmas present signified. It is odd that your girlfriend didn't also mention it when you opened a present that so clearly wasn't your normal style and explained that it was given so that you could specifically wear it to the party.\n\nUnder the circumstances you do need to attempt to retrieve it because  your not wearing the sweater for the occasion will be very much noticed. Typically when clothing is returned, it isn't generally obvious to the donor or it doesn't really matter.", "YTA. I thought a 14 yr old wrote this. Man, they get married young these days.", "YTA. It\u2019s a gift. That doesn\u2019t mean you have to use it. But keeping it as a keepsake it great. My BIL got me a really ugly ass bracelet with really ugly charms. I don\u2019t really wear bracelets but I didn\u2019t give it back. In fact I still have it because it\u2019s about respect. It\u2019s not whether I\u2019ll wear it, it\u2019s the thought that the parent was getting at. My child has a SO, I should gift something that\u2019s tradition in our family to them.", "YTA, you say you're 24 but you sound like you are 12. What you did was super rude, her mum just wanted to include you in the festivities.", "YTA. Do you talk to your girlfriend? You could\u2019ve discussed the gift and laughed together. Or told her you wanted to return it. Both of these were options that would\u2019ve brought the party into the conversation. Also, how do you not know about ugly Christmas sweaters. It\u2019s about being tacky. Emo you wearing it would be hilarious and you\u2019d be the hit of the party! What\u2019s wrong with you?", "YTA - You sound like me when I was 15.", "the lightest softest YTA. as a fellow emo, my family knows not to buy me anything outside of a certain color range but my partners family not so much. You weren't the A H for not liking the sweater, you're  N  T A for wanting to return it but you ARE T A for not even waiting till after the holidays and then immediately using the return money to buy something else. It would've been smarter to wait and communicate with your partner on what the sweater is about but you are well within your rights to have a personal style you don't want to comprise. a lot of the comments think OP is childish just because their style choice is emo? yall are T A for that. \n\nOP see if you can find anyway to get the sweater back and if it's truly impossible then you HAVE to fess up to it. I'd scrounge around a local goodwill for an equally \"ugly xmas sweater\" to kind of show you're playing along. but please please never let these normie comments make you feel like being emo is \"childish\" or \"immature\". girls wanna wear ugg boots, flannels and PSL everything like it's a personality, then you can definitely wear as much black and as many spikes as you choose.", "YTA, but only slightly. Mom and GF should have told you that the sweater was specifically so you had something to wear to their ugly Christmas sweater party. If you had known that, I hope you would have kept it to wear since it is their tradition. I think YTA because you should have shown your GF the receipt and asked her thoughts on returning it. It would have given her an opportunity to tell you why your mom gave you such an ugly sweater.", "YTA, you should not have returned it, plain and simple. Grow up dude, you can wear a color for one night. Was your plan to look like Kim K at the Christmas party? Boring af with no colors at all?", "ESH\n\nI'm pretty open to the black-is-my-soul aesthetic, as my bestfriend and my boyfriend are both permanent occupants of that world of band tees and ripped fishnets. My bf is what the christmas-cult folks might call a grouch/grinch, so I went online and picked out some ugly xmas sweaters that he would like or that were funny, and I sent them to him asking him which he'd wear - he picked one out and now he's got the gear to wear to the season's holiday parties. He loves it, it's a skull with a santa hat and candy canes- it has a nice heavy metal vibe.\n\nYou suck - because maybe it isn't your style, but it's still a gift - at least wait until the season's over before you return something. Personally, I've never returned clothes ppl have gotten me, I don't have a specific style that I aim for- but ultimately, it's rude to return the gift so quickly.\n\nMIL sucks - because she didn't consider your preference as far as style or humor. Maybe it being the gaudiest thing ever (and completely outside of your style) was part of the joke in getting it for you, but maybe she ought to have consulted your girlfriend on what you'd like.\n\nGF Sucks - because I think she ought to have told you what the upcoming party expectations are and not assume you knew, having never been there before...so communication and coordination to make you feel comfortable and welcomed would go a long way. I would never bring my partner somewhere around folks he's never been before without filling him in on expectations and talking about what's appropriate to say around certain folks.\n\nEDIT: HONEST QUESTION-Would you be opposed to a sweater that was more christmas emo themed? Like a Krampus Sweater?", "YTA. It was a gift and you sound too entitled / spoiled to understand appreciation. You didn't have to LIKE the gift. It was given with good intentions so unless you have a physical or emotional reason to be unable to wear that sweater (maintaining your \"cool emo image\" is just an entitled excuse), it was expected for you to wear that sweater at least for Christmas. You sound like someone who never learned gift etiquette and/or proper manners.", "YTA I'm emo, have been for 20 odd years, i wear the stupid xmas jumpers that my MIL buys because it's funny seeing the family pics of me looking like Amy Lee got into a fight with a christmas tree. You could have run it past your girlfriend first 'would your mum be offended if i exchanged it for something more me' or something. EMP sells xmas jumpers with bands and stuff on them, i have a Freddy Kruger one that says 'he knows when you are sleeping'. I attached some of those beard baubles so MIL couldnt say it wasn't christmassy enough lol. Have some fun with it", "NTA.  I would have done the same thing, party or not.  Go to a thrift shop and find something sort of seasonal.  You might even find a red scarf.  Go to the party.  When asked, admit that you didn\u2019t know you were supposed to wear the sweater for the party.  Fess up and get in front of it.

I always take them and exchange them for something else. But my wife is 100% on board with that.

We visit her Mom (F54) for dinner once a month.\n\nLast weekend we went over to her Mom's house for dinner. As we were leaving, her Mom hands me a wrapped box. An early Christmas present! I open it to find the ugliest. sweater. I. have. ever. seen. It's bright red with green stripes and gold jingle bells. The sweater literally jingles as you walk. On the front is a huge picture of a cartoon reindeer. The collar and sleeves are covered in white, frilly ruffles. The sweater is hideous and childish.\n\nI wear black ripped jeans, spiked collars, and band tees. I wear black eyeliner and my dark hair covers my eyes. I wear platform converse and black nail polish. I do not wear brightly coloured Christmas sweaters.\n\nI smiled politely and thanked her for the gift, knowing that I could NEVER bring myself to even TRY ON the sweater. My girlfriend and I went home. When I got to our room, I reopened the box to shove the sweater in the back of the closet where I hopefully wouldn't have to see it for a long time. As I picked it up, a paper fell off of the bottom of the box. It was the receipt.\n\nMy mother-in-law probably got it gift wrapped at the store. Maybe the employee left it in the gift receipt by accident. The sweater was rather expensive. I knew that at the store she got it at I could return the sweater for store credit.\n\nI returned the sweater the next day, without the knowledge of my girlfriend. I planned to use the store credit to buy her some things she'd been wanting. I was low on money, and had been stressing about Christmas presents. This would be the perfect opportunity to be able to afford some nice gifts for her. I bought the gifts and got them wrapped.\n\nWhen I got home, my girlfriend reminded me of a Christmas party that her mother was hosting in a few days. Every year, her mother hosts a HUGE party. All of my girlfriend's family and friends were going to be there.\n\nShe suggests I wear the sweater. Some sort of negative expression must cross my face, because she asks me what's wrong. I explain to her that I returned the sweater with the receipt I found.\n\nHer face drops.\n\nOur conversation went something like this:\n\nGF: My mom bought that for you so that you could wear it to the party.\n\nOP: How was I supposed to know that was her intention? This is my first year going to the party. I don't know what kind of clothing I'm supposed to wear.\n\nGF: You could have asked. You're just going to wear something emo anyways.\n\nOP: Yeah, because that's my style. That's what I ALWAYS wear, and you and your family are going to have to get used to it.\n\nMy girlfriend is telling me to repurchase the sweater, but I don't have the money to do that. I don't want to return her gifts and I purchased some of them on sale so I literally can't.\n\nI don't think I'm in the wrong. I got gifted a sweater that I would NEVER wear, so I returned it so I could buy something nice for my girlfriend. AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
