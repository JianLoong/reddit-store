The older one being responsible and living within means, while the younger splurges and doesn't pay extra on the loan, I think it's fair you helped the older one with the last payment and a little fun money. As others have said, the rent, utilities and groceries savings should well more than fund getting ahead on the loan. I had credit cards and a whole brand new truck paid off fast because of my parents help with the living situation.. this was 20 years ago though.", "NTA. As a student just graduated I am paying rent to my parents since I was able to work and they give me food and shelter at a much lower price. You let your daughter live rent free. On the other hand with how is the housing market right now which is a hell on earth, your other daughter paid almost her debt in full... you know what? Give your youngest 1k and tell her to pay her debt with that but also tell her she needs to pay the rest herself. She receive the same treatment as her sister.\n\nEnglish isn't my first language. Sorry for the mistakes.", "NTA if anything your oldest daughter should be \"upset\" by how much more you're helping your youngest. She doesn't pay rent, that's already more than 1k a month that you're saving her. Not to mention utilities and food since you're probably paying for most if not all of that. Your youngest is a big girl with a big girl job, she needs to pay her own rent and loan payments instead of acting like an entitled teenager just because her big sister got a \"congratulations on being a successful and productive adult\" present", "NTA.\n\nYour approach is actually very fair. \n\nPerhaps showing them the actual contribution towards younger\u2019s loan repayment via rent, utilities, food would help her understand.\n\nBut I think she\u2019s just wanting a free ride from the bank of mom and dad.", "NTA. Similar situation. My daughter is on her own but struggles and I help her with rent. My son lives with us and is furious we help her (there is significant bad blood between them). \n\nBut I have pointed out SEVERAL times that him living rent-free, not paying utilities or for his phone is WAY more than what we subsidize her.", "Never reward people for bad behavior.", "NTA\u2026do not give in! I would..like others suggested\u2026say that she may get a bonus when she gets down to $500, too! (Even though she doesn\u2019t deserve that).  Then drop it\u2026never address it again\u2026treat yourself to a cold one. Cheers! \ud83c\udf7b", "NTA. Add up all the money you\u2019ve spent housing the younger daughter.  Include everything down to toiletries.   A percentage of the water, electricity etc and also include a reasonable amount for rent.  Show your wife and kid this list.  Ask them if they would prefer you give the daughter $1000 or continue letting her live with you.  I would also start charging her rent.  Maybe not market rates but a real amount, nonetheless.  Even if you give it back to her at some point, she needs to learn about the real world. And get serious about her future.  Your wife is NoT helping your youngest by doing what she has been.", "She's learning a very expensive life lesson. NTA", "Yup. Show your daughter this. She gets 1k and gets to reflect on how much more she owes, as well as what a brat she\u2019s made herself seem to be.", "Nta. Covering her room and board is contributing to her loans. She should have put more towards them.", "Absolutely NTA.  Tell youngest you\u2019ll help her when her debt is down to $500, just like her sister.  You\u2019d be treating them both the same.", "NTA\n\nWrite out an itemized bill for her rent food electricity and any other bills you pay every month on her behalf. Give that piece of paper to her wrapped up nicely as a gift for her next birthday.", "NTA. Why should your give her money every month to pay off her loans. You didn't do that with the oldest daughter. If your wife really wants to \"keep the piece\". Give youngest 1k to pay toward her loans. And the lazy entitled brat can pay the rest off her self.", "You gave her 1k. Make it even. Give the entitled one the same 1k and call it done. She can either be grateful about it or suck it up. If you do as your wife says and give her money every month, that would not be equal with your eldest. So 1k to each and that\u2019s final. She should have enough saving from free rent to pay more but chooses to be financially reckless.\n\nAlso noting. Paying the minimum? Does she know that she\u2019s really only paying interest and she\u2019ll be paying that loan for more than 10 years if she continues to only pay the minimum.", "NTA because free housing will save her so much money, and she should be very grateful for that! \nBut, while paying off loans should be a priority, she\u2019s paying them off it seems, she paying the minimum she has to, and she\u2019s allowed to treat herself. She should not have to give up everything that gives her joy just to pay off her loans. She can prioritise her loans (like your eldest did) but she doesn\u2019t HAVE to", "I was ready to say you were being unfair until I read that it was only $500 and your more responsible daughter was ready to pay it herself.\n\nYour other daughter has received far more from you I n housing. You can tell her you\u2019ll pay off the last $500 of her loan when she is ready. Then give her a timeline of another couple of months until you will start charging her rent. Depending on where you live, $500/month for a room and access to the house seems fair. \n\nNTA", "Maybe you should start giving the daughter who paid of her loans the same amount you \"give\" your spoiled daughter. Since you only have two daughters - try to keep the financial assistance equal. You need to start to have the spoiled daughter pay rent. \n\nWe have two adult sons with school loans. One lives at home, one lives on their own. We pay $500 a month on the one who  lives on their own. Nothing to the one who lives with us. The one who lives with is smart enough to know he has the better deal.", "It's likely he has already \"gifted\" the younger daughter more than 1k by covering all of her living expenses, so that should be taken into consideration too.", "Exactly!!!\n\nAlso NTA", "Yes! NTA 100%", "This would also make sense in the \"Happy Wife, Happy Life doctrine\" but you will still know whom you are prouder of...", "There is no other right answer than this", "> not directly paying them Im still helping her by letting her live at home rent free and s\n\nThat's not fair. The younger has been paying less for rent for so long. Don't you think she could have saved 1K by now?", "Op, many people on this sub have solved this type of issue instantly by creating a spreadsheet with a cost comparison. \n\nYour wife might be a little shocked as well. \n\nIt\u2019s so easy for \u201cfree rent\u201d to get overlooked in the grand scheme of things bc people see it as living with their parents. \n\nDoes your daughter pay for her groceries? The utilities? Internet? \n\nThese are things your OLDEST is also paying for, not just her own rent. \n\nBe sure to include the whole breakdown AND even the \u201c$1000k credit \ud83d\ude44\u201d so she can see that it\u2019s been applied for fairness!", "More than fair......youngest has gotten a lot more help than the oldest and has no reason to complain.\n\nIf the youngest continues to squeak about it being unfair, remind her of what you can be doing to make it fair: kick her out to live on her own and then will pay $1000 when she gets her loan down to $500", "I was gonna say, if she's got gross 55k, has no living expenses, I don't know what she's blowing everything on that she is only paying minimums.", "I would go with the standard rent payment plus a bit extra towards the loan every month, say $1000-1500.", "Yeah from the title it sounded like it would be like $50k vs bupkis. Not $1000, when there was already a college fund.", "Unless it's a small loan I'd presume 25 years for an ICR.", "Yes? I\u2019m surprised too. If she can\u2019t tell the difference between the two situations, college was a waste of time.", "Yes. The youngest is being an ungrateful brat.", "Shit of she\u2019s been living at home for more than a month he\u2019s probably already \u201cgiven\u201d her more than the other sibling"]}
