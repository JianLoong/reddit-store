Both of my two daughters graduated from simimlarly costing universites, I had a school fund set up for both of them but it didn't cover everything. They both after graduating had about 60k in student loan debt. They also both were lucky to find jobs in their fields a few months after graduating with similar salaries about 55k a year. \n\nHowever, they took vastly different approaches to their debt, my eldest for the last three years has lived extremely frugally and outside of basic needs and bills all her extra money goes into paying her debt off. My youngest on the other hand asked if she could live at home until she gets her loans paid off, but she still only pays the minimum required to send every month and spends the rest of her money on herself.\n\nNow the issue started a few days ago, my eldest called me all excited because her loan debt was down to $500 and she would be able to finally pay it off when she next gets paid. We spoke for a bit more and after the call ended I decided to surprise her by sending her 1k, to pay off the rest of her debt and so she could finally have some money to do something for her for once. When I was talking to my wife and youngest daughter over dinner about how impressed I was that she paid it off so fast, my youngest started yelling about how I've never given her money towards her loans. I explained that while I'm not directly paying them Im still helping her by letting her live at home rent free and she could be closer to paying it off if she spent less on things she doesn't need. After screaming and crying to me a bit more she stormed off and is staying at her boyfriends currently. My wife thinks that I should promise to give her some money each month to help her pay the loan off faster so we can keep the peace at home but I don't think I should reward her for nothing.", "created_utc": 1687623918, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14hx3tr/aita_for_helping_pay_off_one_of_my_daughters/", "score": 46, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Just say you\u2019ll give her 1k when her debt is down to 500 dollars. Problem solved.", "NTA technically by allowing her to live at home with you this whole time you\u2019ve probably paid more towards your youngest loans than your eldest\u2019s anyway when you take into account extra groceries, power and water.", "NTA\n\nThe amount of money she has saved by not having to pay rent is more than the 1k you gave to your eldest daughter. \n\nYour youngest daughter may not see it that way but I think you\u2019ve been more than fair and reasonable.", "NTA.   Make daughter pay rent, a reasonable market rate.  No parent discount.  Then tell her when her loans are at $1000 you will pay them off.  \n\nYou do no favors by allowing her to overspend and continue to depend on you for support.  He lack of gratitude and respect show this is a lesson in life she desperately needs.   Good luck getting on the same page as your wife.   That will require honest and respectful communication too", "NTA. \n\nAs a compromise, you can tell her you'll pay the last 1k of her debt, if she pays off the rest of the amount within abc amount of time", "NTA. You maybe could offer to do the same for her, as in make her final payment for her when she gets it below $1k.  But she\u2019s not entitled to it, her reaction itself makes me not want to help ger", "your wife is actually making it worse for this little girl.", "NTA. She has cost you much more than $1k in extra utilities and I\u2019m sure she eats your food and other additional costs.", "NTA- your oldest daughter was one payment away-  as a congratulatory gesture you made that one payment and gave her an extra $500 to treat herself. While part of me 100% agrees that you are indirectly helping your youngest-  to keep the peace with your wife, tell your youngest daughter you\u2019ll do the same for her- when she\u2019s $500 away from paying off her debt, you\u2019ll give her $1000. If you\u2019re wife thinks you should do more then you can point out that you\u2019re being \u201cfair.\u201d They\u2019re each getting the same $$.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nYou're helping your daughter become an independant and responsible adult.", "NTA\n\nTell your younger daughter you will give her the same deal that you gave your older daughter, who by far is more mature, and less entitled.\n\nAlso tell your younger daughter and wife that the point of her living at home without having to pay rent was so she could put that money towards her loans.  But she is choosing not to be responsible and take advantage of the time back home with you to pay her debt down. She is instead wasting almost 55K per year.\n\nSo...now there is a new rule.  That she must pay $500 a month towards her student loan, or she needs to move out within 30 days.  That will give her time to save for deposit and other apt expenses.\n\nIf your older daughter was able to pay for an apt, pay all her expenses,  and pay her loans off in 3 yrs with a similar salary as your younger daughter, that your younger daughter most certainly could also  have almost paid her loans off if she had been responsible with her money \n\nBut since she is choosing not to be responsible with her.money,  that you are not rewarding her by paying towards her loans, nor will  you continue enabling her spending problems by allowing her to live at home and basically blow her salary each month with nothing be to show for it &while only making minimum loan payment .\n\nTell your wife privately that you will be extremely upset if she goes against you and pays towards younger daughter's loans.  That you are trying to teach her to be responsible financially.\n\n\nI have a feeling your wife always jumps in to prematurely reward your younger daughter, or to make excuses for her, or save her from unpleasant circumstances.  In short, your wife probably has enabled your younger daughter's bad habits.  Otherwise she could clearly  see that helping your younger daughter by giving her money each month is preposterous.", "NTA - Give your youngest a one off $500 and then say you've now paid off exactly the same amount of her student debt as you have for your eldest daughter.", "Your daughters are both college grads (hooray!) but does your younger daughter understand how loans and interest works? I ask only because she\u2019s paying the minimum payment which is I\u2019ll advised by pretty much everyone. She\u2019s going to be paying on that loan forever if this is the approach she\u2019s taking. Perhaps offer her the $1000 if she agrees to sit down and make an executable financial plan to pay off her loans. If she doesn\u2019t want you involved, sign her up for a financial planning course. NTA.", "NTA. Your daughter needs to be a responsible adult and learn how to prioritize her bill payments. Tell your wife that you\u2019ll help your daughter manage a budget to pay off her loan and save money, and will gift her $1k when she gets to her last payment. Fair is fair. If she wants you to pay a % of younger daughter\u2019s loan than your wife has to pay back your older daughter the same amount.", "NTA, you rewarded your eldest daughter's responsibility.  Honestly with her entitlement and reaction, I probably wouldn't even give the younger daughter 1k when she gets close to paying it off.  Though, I guess everyone does things different, but my wife and I don't spend that much money on things without running it by each other first.", "Charge her a small rent thar you save up and use to pay off her student debt.   NTA.", "NTA- ugh, your youngest sounds kind of awful. At least you can console yourself that one of your kids came out right. You WANT to reward hard work and sacrifice, not entitlement and poor fiscal habits. Your oldest earned a reward, and your youngest deserves nothing; besides,  she's already getting a huge handout with her living expenses. What is your wife thinking?", "NTA \n\nYour daughter is not paying rent, nor food,yet still only makes $1000. You are helping her more than your older daughter.  I suggest you start making her pay rent, but apply that to tge loans.", "NTA give her money each month hell no give her 1k same as other daughter and be done with it.", "I'd give her the same $1000 for her loans.

Unless you\u2019re in a really low COL area, you\u2019ve already saved your younger daughter a huge amount of money that she would\u2019ve paid in rent.
