(self.AmItheAsshole)\n\nsubmitted 4 hours ago by Relevant_Injury3052\n\nI'm currently being given the cold shoulder by both my youngest daughter and wife over this so I thought I'd get an outside opinion. Both of my two daughters graduated from simimlarly costing universites, I had a school fund set up for both of them but it didn't cover everything. They both after graduating had about 60k in student loan debt. They also both were lucky to find jobs in their fields a few months after graduating with similar salaries about 55k a year.\n\nHowever, they took vastly different approaches to their debt, my eldest for the last three years has lived extremely frugally and outside of basic needs and bills all her extra money goes into paying her debt off. My youngest on the other hand asked if she could live at home until she gets her loans paid off, but she still only pays the minimum required to send every month and spends the rest of her money on herself.\n\nNow the issue started a few days ago, my eldest called me all excited because her loan debt was down to $500 and she would be able to finally pay it off when she next gets paid. We spoke for a bit more and after the call ended I decided to surprise her by sending her 1k, to pay off the rest of her debt and so she could finally have some money to do something for her for once. When I was talking to my wife and youngest daughter over dinner about how impressed I was that she paid it off so fast, my youngest started yelling about how I've never given her money towards her loans. I explained that while I'm not directly paying them Im still helping her by letting her live at home rent free and she could be closer to paying it off if she spent less on things she doesn't need. After screaming and crying to me a bit more she stormed off and is staying at her boyfriends currently. My wife thinks that I should promise to give her some money each month to help her pay the loan off faster so we can keep the peace at home but I don't think I should reward her for nothing.\n\n<QUOTE>", "I\u2019m leaning to NTA but a bit of info is needed: why didn\u2019t you consult your wife?

Then, sit down and ask your youngest how long she expects to live with you since her current approach could take her 20+ years to pay off her loans.", "NTA .. she spoiled . Get her a spread sheet of her saving money by not paying rent and tell her now you see that the older sister needs more money from you lol", "Nta give her 1k and then start charging rent", "NTA, but your wife may be wise. The best father advice is \u201cbe nice to your daughters, as they will choose your retirement home\u201d!", "Tell her to move out like the other daughter and she will receive her 1k \ud83d\ude01", "NTA - Older sister lived frugally to pay off her loans. Youngest can do the same - probably quicker, since she's living rent free on a 55k a year salary. When youngest is down to $500 in loans, you can give her $1000.", "INFO: Do you have a track record of favoring one daughter over the other?", "NTA, to be honest (and I will get a bit personal here) I don't think this matter should concern any of your daughters, as you are benefiting them regardless. It's your decision how you support them. I have a few brothers/sisters. While our parents were adamant on being equal about some things (i.e, they paid all our driving licenses but said we'd each have to work for our own car, they paid our university fees despite some going to state university and others into private universities), etc. But on some other things the treatment is clearly different. For example, when I got my home, I got some help from them on the furniture. Whereas my brother for example, got both that help plus a lot of help (financially and otherwise) for the renovations, and I help him too. My youngest sister is the most spoiled of all, she gets to spend more in a month in trivial stuff than we used to in a year (ok maybe that's a bit exaggerated, but there's a notorious difference) and didn't even bother to apply for public university. The point is, they have always been there to help all of us when it was needed, and no one bickers on who got more or less, because we were always helped according to our needs, and everybody chips in also.  \n\n\nSo, in short, NTA. And you shouldn't reward her for nothing, let alone support that kind of reaction, but that's my opinion only... Still, do help her when she turns around and realizes she is being unfair. As someone suggested... Promise her the same 1000 dollars when she gets her debt down, maybe that will encourage her to be more hasty about it.", "NTA. Give her $1k and then it's \"fair.\" WTF is wrong with your wife, though? You should give spendy McSpenderson money EVERY MONTH?! to pay off her debt. I don't think so. Guess we know who the golden child is.", "Charge her rent and pay that into her loans.", "Boy this is one of my pet peeves.  You are definitely NOT TAH.  I have a brother who never has any money and still has student loan debt after being out of college for 8 years.  Yet he refuses to get a roommate to share expenses, has a phone plan with all the bells and whistles, same as his cable.  Live in a super expensive apartment and drives a 1 year old car.  He tells me that these are just the basic necessities of life...  He's always wanting money, nope.", "Sounds to me like the youngest is spoiled and (not to mention jealous of her sister) threw a fit to get even more than she already is with free rent/food/utilites etc which depending on where they live could be upwards of $1500 or more a month!  He is helping her a hell of a lot more than his other daughter who he gave a meager $1000. If anyone is being unfairly treated it's her. The young daughter sounds ungrateful of what her parents have already done.\n\nDid you  offer the same deal to the other daughter?\n\nStill, NTA. \n\nEvidently allowing your daughter to stay at home has  enabled her to waste money that should be spent on paying off debt since you make no mention of an attempt to check her behavior. It only became a problem when you rewarded your other daughter (which was an awesome thing for you to do btw) . \n\nThe only way to stop this is to set clear boundaries with the daughter at home. She asked to stay at home to pay off her debt. She is not doing that so now is the perfect opportunity to sit down and address this. What she has done is take advantage of your and your wife, whether she purposefully meant to or not. What is the root cause here? Is this a financial lack of discipline due to access to a lot of money?  If she needs help budgeting and she's just not good at it that can easily be helped. \n\nIf this spending behavior continues despite attempting to help with budget then she likely needs to move out.\n\nShe's an adult living in an adult world and sometimes the best way of learning, though it hurts us as parents,  is a little tough love.\n\nBest of Luck to you and your family.", "NTA- She lives at home. She can literally put more money towards the loan, even if it\u2019s just an extra $75 a month. Just tell her you\u2019ll give her $1k when she gets down to the last $500.", "NTA", "Tell the youngest daughter that you'll give her the same amount that you gave her sister- 1k.\n\nDid your wife and daughter not see how the elder daughter went with the bare necessities to pay down her debt faster? She did this on her own while paying her other bills including rent. Little Miss 'I'll stay at home until I pay my loans off' lives rent free, makes the minimum payment required and spends the rest of her money on herself.\n\nTime for a reality check. Sit your wife and daughter down and tell her that you only paid $500 towards her sisters loans and you are willing to do the same for her. What you will not do is be guilted into paying the majority of her loans. She is an adult now. She doesn't have to worry about paying rent and probably doesn't buy food either so why can't she pay down her loans faster? Where does most of her paycheck go? Does she want to be living with you until she's 40? Just because she lives at home is no reason to treat her salary as a bonus money. She should be aggressively tackling her debt.\n\nIf she still insists, tell her the sweet deal is off. She can start paying rent, either at your house or somewhere else. She can start buying groceries and paying for all her needs. Let her see how far that salary goes when you're the one paying for everything. Your wife's idea of helping her pay down her debt is a bad idea because it won't teach her anything. It might keep the peace but she'll never learn that sometimes you need to make short term sacrifices for long term goals.", "NTA your daughter seems to take staying at her parents place rent free for granted. I think you done a really nice thing, rewarding your daughter for her mature behaviour. Well done \ud83d\udc4f", "NTA just give her 1000. This isn't so much about the debt as it it about giving to them. You gave one daughter 1000 so give the other the same amount.

Ask her how much she still owes on her debt.  \nAsk her to explain how that is possible when her sister pays rent and got her debt down to $500.\n\nGet an inspired look on your face and say, its because your sister paid rent and you didn\u2019t do that\u2019s why she got so much of her debt paid for so fast.  So, we\u2019re going to start charging you the same amount of rent your sister has paid from now on.  \n\nMay be nonsense but it should work as well as your wife suggesting you give her money each month for what?  You know she wouldn\u2019t use it to pay down her debt either.  Next, she will complain that her debt is preventing her from planning her wedding and honeymoon, so you should pay that too.", "That behaviour would be the signal to cut off any help until she apologizes and do something nice FOR YOU.", "Sounds to me like comparing your daughters is very hurtful.

If not, then your older daughter would have more reason to be \"upset\" as the younger one is getting vastly more money, albeit indirectly.\r  \n\r  \nIf your younger daughter does not pay any household bills, what you can do is make a spreadsheet of the costs of having her in the house (that she is not paying for, minus the rent perhaps) and do that for every month she has been staying with you.

Also, in that same spreadsheet, show her how long she would have to stay living at home for (with the rate she is paying off her loans now) and how much, in the end you would have spent on her.\r  \nMaybe that will give her some perspective (and your wife as well!) \r  \n\r  \nIf there continues to be issues, then you might have to become the 'bad cop'.
