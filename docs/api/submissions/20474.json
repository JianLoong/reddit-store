(self.AmItheAsshole)\n\nsubmitted 4 hours ago by Relevant_Injury3052\n\nI'm currently being given the cold shoulder by both my youngest daughter and wife over this so I thought I'd get an outside opinion. Both of my two daughters graduated from simimlarly costing universites, I had a school fund set up for both of them but it didn't cover everything. They both after graduating had about 60k in student loan debt. They also both were lucky to find jobs in their fields a few months after graduating with similar salaries about 55k a year.\n\nHowever, they took vastly different approaches to their debt, my eldest for the last three years has lived extremely frugally and outside of basic needs and bills all her extra money goes into paying her debt off. My youngest on the other hand asked if she could live at home until she gets her loans paid off, but she still only pays the minimum required to send every month and spends the rest of her money on herself.\n\nNow the issue started a few days ago, my eldest called me all excited because her loan debt was down to $500 and she would be able to finally pay it off when she next gets paid. We spoke for a bit more and after the call ended I decided to surprise her by sending her 1k, to pay off the rest of her debt and so she could finally have some money to do something for her for once. When I was talking to my wife and youngest daughter over dinner about how impressed I was that she paid it off so fast, my youngest started yelling about how I've never given her money towards her loans. I explained that while I'm not directly paying them Im still helping her by letting her live at home rent free and she could be closer to paying it off if she spent less on things she doesn't need. After screaming and crying to me a bit more she stormed off and is staying at her boyfriends currently. My wife thinks that I should promise to give her some money each month to help her pay the loan off faster so we can keep the peace at home but I don't think I should reward her for nothing.\n\n<QUOTE>", "I\u2019m leaning to NTA but a bit of info is needed: why didn\u2019t you consult your wife?

It's your decision how you support them. I have a few brothers/sisters. While our parents were adamant on being equal about some things (i.e, they paid all our driving licenses but said we'd each have to work for our own car, they paid our university fees despite some going to state university and others into private universities), etc. But on some other things the treatment is clearly different. For example, when I got my home, I got some help from them on the furniture. Whereas my brother for example, got both that help plus a lot of help (financially and otherwise) for the renovations, and I help him too. My youngest sister is the most spoiled of all, she gets to spend more in a month in trivial stuff than we used to in a year (ok maybe that's a bit exaggerated, but there's a notorious difference) and didn't even bother to apply for public university. The point is, they have always been there to help all of us when it was needed, and no one bickers on who got more or less, because we were always helped according to our needs, and everybody chips in also.  \n\n\nSo, in short, NTA. And you shouldn't reward her for nothing, let alone support that kind of reaction, but that's my opinion only... Still, do help her when she turns around and realizes she is being unfair.

Then tell her she is to move out by the end of the summer or start paying off more of her debt because at the rate she\u2019s going paying the bare minimum she will literally never pay it off.

Yes say that you will give her 1,000 when she down to her final 500. Also, maybe charge her a bit of rent.

By allowing younger daughter to live at home for free, he's given her FAR more financial help - she's just chosen to pay the bare minimum and spend the rest of her money more frivolously than her sister. Sucks for her, but he's not punishing her. She's been given way, way more help. I was able to live at home after college and it was SUCH a godsend  - paying back loans is way, way easier when you don't have to pay rent, utilities, etc. She absolutely could be farther along with her loans if she'd chosen to be.
