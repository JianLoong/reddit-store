The friend is annoying however judging by OP's comments here, they are a complete asshole too.", "From what I\u2019ve seen looking it up just now, the boycott is literally siding with Hamas, so no thanks. Fuck both sides", "\nThe Starbucks boycott seems to be about standing with Palestine, I assume that it is because Starbucks(Corperation) is suing Starbucks, Workers United Union, over a tweet or something that said \u201cSolidarity with Palestine.\u201d. Basically Starbucks outright stated they do not support/approve of support for Palestine, but do support Israel. This would be the reasoning for the boycott, along with protests against Starbucks, and them being metaphorically dragged through the mud.", "The boycott is siding with the Palestine people (so not Hamas), who Israel oppresses. Starbucks sends money to help Israel\u2019s effort in harming innocents.", "That is wrong and ...kinda racist, OP.", "In a completely different take, I\u2019ve recently been boycotting Starbucks because of how staunchly anti-union they are. Many workers report unsafe conditions/schedules, inadequate pay, etc. support a local coffee shop instead! Usually way better IMO", "I don\u2019t follow the news, but isn\u2019t Hamas a literal terrorist organization? Why tf would I boycott something in solidarity with a terrorist wtf\ud83d\ude02", "Israel is fighting Hamas. Hamas are terrorists. Israel isn\u2019t good, but Hamas literally shot up a music festival", "Because not everyone in Palestine is Hama's, not everyone in Palestine is a terrorist, and Israel has been invading Palestine since like 1948 and has made various parts of Palestine identity a crime:\n\nFor example, Israel's government banned the Palestine flag from 1964 until 1993, and in January of this year announced plans to do so again.

To say so is dehumanising. And to be perfectly fair, the Westbank which is also being bombed and attacked by Israel is not governed by Hama's, it's governed by Fatah's. \n\nSo yeah. \n\nJust as not everyone who is Jewish supports Israel, and not every Israeli is is a Zionist, not every Palestine is a terrorist. People who want peace and freedom for Palestine do not want to hurt or harm Jewish people. They just want Palestine to be free. And no, before anyone asks, I do not support Hama's and yes I condemn their actions.", "I also do not follow the news, I got this information from what seemed to be a well informed TikTok, and looked around for a little bit to see if it had some truth to it. You should do your own research, just in case I missed something, or just am not communicating it properly.", "I'm on the side of protecting civilians on both sides since their aren't a part of the fighting. But as for your post, nta. You weren't trying to turn everyone on your friend, your friend did by being pushy. She can be vegan or boycott anything she wants. Doesn't mean yall have to as well.", "oh not this take", "Not to be rude. However, you\u2019ve said yourself that you don\u2019t keep up with the news. Therefore, I believe it would be in your favour to research a little about what has happened in the last few weeks and then form your opinion on the matter\n\nedit: I\u2019m not saying that the Hamas are good. They aren\u2019t, however, your rhetoric goes in line with the assumption that all Palestinians are Hamas, and that Hamas are a representation for a whole country, which isn\u2019t true.", "1) Israel are \"fighting Hamas\" but murdering thousands of children. They also killed more UN employees and journalists than Hamas members. \n\n2) Israeli military helicopters were confirmed to have fired in the crowd at the music festival the day of the attack and also confirmed they are responsible for the \"collateral damages\" (Israeli civilians killed as a result). \n\n3) Companies like Starbucks are funding Israel and its army, and aiding in the total destruction of Gaza and its civilians, half of whom are children who did not even vote for Hamas.  This is called collective punishment and it's a war crime. \n\n4) Yesterday, as a \"temporary ceasefire\" was already agreed and in place, Palestinians attempted to return to their homes where they were forced to flee from. 2 hours after the ceasefire agreement, Israeli troops started to shoot at those civilians and broke the humanitarian pause.  Again, this army is funded by your tax dollars as well as big corporations like Starbucks. \n\n\nYour morals should indeed dictate where you spend your money, and truth be told Starbucks should not be receiving a dollar from us. What's happening to Palestinians is sickening.", "OP I gave you a bunch of resources about why Palestine is not Hama's give it up and do some research. \n\nNot every thought you have needs to be shared.", "The average age of palestinian victims is five years old. How many 5 year old terrorists do you know?", "Yeah and isrealis are not shooting up innocent people please they have killed thousands of Palestinian civilians including children. What do you think about that", "Palestinians are not Hamas. We are boycotting because we do not support collective punishment against peoples for something they have no control over. It\u2019s literal war crimes within the Geneva Convention that Israel is breaking.", "I mean realistically if they just gave up all their land, the Israelian civilians would have nowhere to live and you\u2019d end up with the exact same war happening again in a couple decades", "I mean I know about the festival shooting so the closest I\u2019ll get to siding with anti-Starbucks is hating everyone involved", "If you freed Palestine tomorrow, Hamas would likely be in control of it. Once Hamas is wiped off the earth or at least out of power, then it\u2019s better", "Free Palestine is not about Israel.giving up their land. It's about leaving Palestine's land alone.", "Seriously? My 12 year old has more of an idea about what is going on there than you do. Please get informed. Thousands of palestinian children have been killed over the last few weeks. Don't just listen to the biases of mainstream media.", "Killing nearly 20000 civilians isn\u2019t wiping out Hamas. The majority of those are children, who should\u2019ve been worrying about their homework and not if they would live long enough to see the next day. \nAlso the concept of wiping out a terrorist grouping is unrealistic since their size might diminish but they never disappear, e.g. the Talibans in Afghanistan.", "West Bank is not Hama's. Also, you're talking about innocent people being wiped off the map. \n\nI wouldn't want to be your friend, you sound like a racist.", "The conflict existed before Hamas was created (by Israel to destabilise the peace agreements).  When you murder thousands of children and their whole families for decades, and you continually oppress them by any mean possible, it does not create any future for them other than growing up in violence.  Terrorism (from Israel) over the last 50+ years is exactly what created extremism in the region.  You don't solve terrorism with more terrorism, we know this from the many wars the US has waged in the name (lies) of freedom and democracy.  \n\nThe true solution is to end occupation once and for all in Palestine and give them sovereignty. But the settlers/colonisers are too scared that the people they oppressed for decades will turn against them and seek revenge. This is exactly what white colonisers were afraid of in apartheid South Africa.", "This is such a typical American way of thinking. This is exactly how they viewed Al Qaeda and next thing you know the US hasn\u2019t destroyed the Middle East.", "Plus I am sure the horrific actions the palestinians are suffering will contribute to more terrorism in the future. \n\nA lot of people would hate and seek revenge against people that killed their entire family.", "Hamas isn\u2019t innocent", "That\u2019s what my mum said when my family and I talked about that matter. All the kids growing up without a family are now easier targets for extremist views and terrorist groups in the future. It\u2019s such a sad cycle that could\u2019ve easily been prevented", "At this point, I\u2019m assuming that you refuse to educate yourself on the matter and just choose to be ignorant on what happens in the world. The person responding to you gave you resources to educate yourself, and you still hold on to the idea that all Palestinians are Hamas. \n\nMaybe you and your friend deserve each other as you both come across as incredibly unlikeable.", "I didn't say they were. But you're talking about killing innocent men, women and children.", "Not every Palestinian is Hamas you racist"]}
