My bf and I were introduced to each other by my sister's boyfriend. My boyfriend had been friends with my sister's boyfriend for a couple years now so my sister knew my boyfriend before I did. She likes to pride herself on the fact that she knew him before I did and she claims they were best friends. She'll constantly ask how he's doing and call him by his birth given name. I told her he prefers his nickname. She said that \"birth given name\" is my boyfriend and \"nickname\" is her friend and she said she refuses to associate the two. She has started calling him by his birth name to his face and I know she does it to spite me. I've asked her to stop calling him by his birth name, as he doesn't like that. \n\nMy boyfriend has told me that he has only been around my sister twice before and it was only because she was tagging along with his friend (her boyfriend). He's also admitted that he thinks she's b*tchy. I told him about how she continues to call him by his birth name and how she said they were best friends and he laughed and said that at most, they were acquaintances, if even that. My sister has also made it a point to tell me that she's met my boyfriend's friends and parents before I did (they're all mutual friends with my sister's boyfriend) and that they love her more than they do me. My boyfriend's friends rarely talk to her and his parents also forgot who she was when I brought her up in a conversation, so it's clear she had no special relationship to them.\n\nAfter I met my boyfriend's parents for the first time, my sister kept asking if they like me and told me that I have a lot of competition because they love her. I also told her that while I was hanging out at my boyfriend's apartment, one of his friends asked me to come into the living room to hang out with all of them. I had told her how nice it was that he had wanted to include me even though I was previously worried about intruding on their conversation. (My boyfriend has told me before that his friends love hanging out with me and that they don't mind me being there at all but I had wanted to stay in his room that day so they could hang out with each other without me being there). My sister immediately jumped to say that the only reason they wanted me there is because she was best friends with all of them and they only wanted to be nice to me for her sake. I told her she's being ridiculous and after a while of arguing I got angry and told her that she's not friends with my boyfriend and that he doesn't like her.\n\nIf she had honestly had a friendship with anyone related to my boyfriend, I genuinely wouldn't mind. But the fact that she brags about it and takes pride in it when she doesn't even have a relationship with them is so incredibly annoying.", "created_utc": 1687887187, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14kk0qt/aita_for_telling_my_sister_that_my_boyfriend/", "score": 85, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You kinda threw your boyfriend under the bus here, and for what? It's not like now that you told her, she will stop. Best case scenario, she just doesn't believe you. If you're not that lucky, she'll try to punish him somehow (maybe by driving a wedge between him and his friend?) Worst case, she makes it her mission to get him to actually like her.\n\nI don't understand why you even talk to her if this is how she acts. You don't have to sit and listen to her tell you about how everyone likes her more, when she starts with that shit you should just leave (or hang up or whatever).", "Is there a reason why your bf doesn't like to be addressed by his birth name?", "Your sisters histrionic narcissism is peaking. NTA", "Your sister sounds like a pick me girl. Sad", "That\u2019s the vibe I was getting. But also why is OP still talking with her sister about the boyfriend. It\u2019s time to exert some boundaries - \u201cif you keep calling my BF by his birth name, I will walk out of the room and end the conversation\u201d - and instead of arguing about it, just do it the next time she starts shit.", "Not that I know of", "I\u2019m 21, sister is 22", "Maybe she is upset that I have a bf too. She has mentioned that she\u2019s annoyed that I\u2019m spending time with him instead of her but she does the same to me when her boyfriend is around, and I\u2019ve never minded, so I think it\u2019s a little hypocritical for her to complain about something she does herself", "Why does it matter? He's asked to be called by one name and OP's sister refuses.", "It honestly sounds like she\u2019s trying to make him seem more important to her than to you. Like a na\u00efve teenage thing. An honest talk with all involved will sort this out quickly.", "She sounds like she's 15. I think she is being possessive because she knew them first", "I\u2019ve tried a couple times to sit down and have a talk with her but she won\u2019t listen and nothing has changed after talking to her about it", "You\u2019re probably right. She was completely on board with us dating until we actually started dating and then suddenly she started causing problems", "Sounds like she sees you as competition and doesn't want them to like you better than her, but she's probably pushing them away with her behavior as well.", "NTA, but I think you should just laugh at her instead of getting annoyed.", "ESH. It is clear you guys have low self-esteem and sibling rivalry. All this do they like me, this person likes me better,this person doesn't even know you is pretty immature and unnecessary. By the way, obviously your bf will tell you his friends like you, and pretend not to be friends with your sister, as he knows you feel threatened.", "this sounds so desperate and pathetic. do you have some sort of sibling rivalry?? i can\u2019t fathom telling such blatant and easily disproved lies about people she barely knows to pretend she\u2019s \u2018better\u2019 than you", "NTA your sister is jealous and competitive in a very non healthy way. Sounds like a compulsive liar.", "I honestly wouldn\u2019t care much if they liked her better. It\u2019s the fact that she treats it like a competition when it\u2019s not. I\u2019d hope they like her because she\u2019s my family and I\u2019d like them to get along but it\u2019s frustrating for her to turn things into a competition when they don\u2019t need to be. Also, before I knew who my boyfriend was, she had mentioned his name to me and had told me she didn\u2019t really know him well and was annoyed that her boyfriend wanted to hang out with him when she didn\u2019t know him. So she herself admitted they weren\u2019t friends and didn\u2019t know each other well. My boyfriend isn\u2019t lying to me about who he\u2019s friends with. I\u2019m also not threatened by my sister. My younger sister (different sister than previously mentioned) has become friends with my boyfriend and I\u2019m actually really happy that they\u2019ve done so. If she were to start bragging about their friendship, then it would become annoying.", "She\u2019s been kind of horrible to me since we were little. Family and friends have noticed for a long time and even admit themselves that she takes some sort of sick satisfaction in trying to make me feel less-than. She\u2019s done it to my other siblings as well but mainly me, I assume because we\u2019re closer in age?", "Yeah, I am not saying he is definitely lying. I am saying in relationships, efforts to appease the SO may not be entirely truthful. It feels like you guys do-mutually, by the way, sorry-do compete with each other. The the second you stop doing that will be the day you find peace. Let her compete with herself, as you remain unbothered."]}
