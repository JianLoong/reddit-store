You following your dad's wishes about the money is an act of support suggesting that what your dad did to his son was ok. It makes you complicit in your father's bigotry. I'm sure money isn't the only way your brother was wronged, but it might help heal some of the damage done.", "YTA not for the money, but for siding with your homophobic dad.

Your father was a bugot who chose outdated beliefs over his own son. Rather than accept his son for who he is and be happy that he found someone to love, your father chose to remain hateful.

Your father disowned your brother for dating a man. So you deserve the entire inheritence because you are straight?

Your brother did not bother to care or be there for your father when he really needed him and your father made the decision that he did not deserve the inheritance. You have no reason to share this with him whatsoever. You reap what you sow. Give him nothing.", "It sounds to me like your real issue isn't with your brother, it's with your girlfriend. You're both wrong, and here's why:\n\nYour brother is absolutely entitled to half the inheritance. Your father made a promise to both of you, and just because your brother wasn't there for the last few weeks of his life doesn't mean he should be penalized financially.\n\nYour girlfriend is wrong too. Just because your dad treated your brother unfairly doesn't mean you should give him a free pass.

But you can keep your opinions and interpretations.\n\nMy vote remains the same.", "From what I understand, the brother was given a choice. He made it. He now faces consequences.\n\nEven if the father is AH, it doesn't make the brother any more entitled to inheritance. The will was made, and now it's OP's decision to do as he pleases.", "No, my brother is bi, he could've dated a woman if he wanted our father's inheritance so badly, but he obviously didn't care about it at that point so I don't know why he does now.", "My brother has dated girls for longer than he dated this dude before he decided to move in with him (which is what made father disown him). I guess it wasn't a complete mistake cause they're still together (as of right now), but he himself chose to live a mediocre life when he did that + dropping out of college, so he should now reap what he sow instead of trying to attack our dad's inheritance like a vulture.", "Because OP's moral compass is homophobic, just like his dad's was. Obviously that's being an AH. This sub is about judging people, and being homophobic is never good.", ">If the brother had been there on his bedside and dad still would have disowned him. Then I\u2019d say differently.\n\nThat's exaclty what happend since he was disowned before dad even got cancer though. If dad didn't disown his son I'm sure the son would've been there for him.", "It's not an opinion nor assumption. OP literally explains it on the comments.", "What kind of choice is that? \"Subject to my homophobic orders or be disowned\" That's not a choice at all. \n\nSure it's OP's money, but still doesn't make him less of an AH for supporting his homophobic AH dad over his brother when his brother did nothing wrong.", "So live a lie in order to appease your homophobic dad and remain part of the will.", "Okay, so he's bi. Your dad is still homophobic and you support that", "You and your dad are still homophobic. Your brother shouldn't limit himself to date a woman just because you both are homophobic, he loves who he loves he doesn't chose that.", "So let me get this right, your dad disowned him for being in a relationship with a man and happy. How are you ok with this? If your brother announced he was gay and didn't like girls at all, would your dad accept this or would he be disowned for being gay? By the sounds of it, you have a lot of soul searching to make the right decision, because your dad obviously didn't make the right one.", "Question when did the disowning occur. You state your brother is 25 so how old was he", "Yes, I know your homophobic dad disowned your brother because he couldn't handle his son dating or moving in with a guy. Still doesn't make you nor your dad less of an AH. Your brother sew nothing it was your dad's doing.", "How do you get to the notion that he's homophobic just because he has a girlfriend and not a boyfriend? That's treading dangerously close to \"you must be homophobic because you're not gay\"", "Still does not entitle him to dad\u2019s money. Which is what this question is about. \n\nIt\u2019s not about the dad being an asshole\u2026", "Choices were made on both sides. Choices, that have consequences. The brother isn't entitled to anything.", "Not what I mean. It was made clear what would happen if the brother kept his \"friend\". He made his choice, regardless. If he really wants to stick to his principles, he needs to stop acting like he's entitled to the inheritance.", "But OP is still an AH, sure legally it's OP's money but he chose to have his homophobic dad's side over his brother (who did nothing wrong). If OP wasn't an AH he would share some of the money with his brother since he should be able to see that his brother deserve to love whoever he wants to love. Buuuut OP also inherited being homophobic, which is what makes him an AH.", "How is being bisexual a choice", "I don't get why you keep saying \"friend\", call him what he is, boyfriend (or maybe fiance/husband who knows). \n\nSure, he made his choice to not submit to his dad's homophobic views. We're here to judge based on morality, morality says that being homophobic is an AH, making OP and his dad AH.\n\nLegally he's not entitled to the money, but morally wise I believe he is. At least this way he could have some sort of family support his dad failed to give him when he was alive.", "Hooking up with somebody is a choice.", "And he should completely shut out that part of himself because his homophobic family hates it?"]}
