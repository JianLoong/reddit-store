He shouldn't be bothering OP, thinking he's entitled to something.", "The disowning happened around 3 years ago.", "it's because of OP's other replies saying his brother should have dated a girl instead of his bf if he wanted an inheritance", ">How do you get to the notion that he's homophobic just because he has a girlfriend and not a boyfriend?\n\n1) I'm a guy married to a girl. 2) I've never claimed that. Where are you getting that from?\n\nOP shows his homophobic views all over the comments. Stating that his brother should have chosen to keep dad happy by dating a girl, and not being able to see how his brother was treated ufairly becuase he was dating a guy. He clearly has something against his brother dating a guy over a girl. He never defends his brother and always takes his homophobic dad's side. I don't care who OP dates. Unlike OP and his dad who care too much who their brother/son dates.", "It is only Your opinion and Your interpretation. Thankfully Your views are in minority here.", "It\u2019s your money, it was given to you. You don\u2019t have to share it with anyone. So NTA\n\nYTA for siding with your dad", "If he did (and I don't read every comment here) that's not homophobic, though. That's \"you know what dad was like, you could have played it another way\". They both knew their dad, they chose different ways to deal with it and both now live with the consequences of their respective decisions and following actions (sich as not visiting dad at the end)", "What? 1. I don't give a crap about your marital status and 2. You said \"his moral compass is homophobic.(just like his dad's).\n\nYou don't know all that. He might have any sorts of issues with his brother.", "Sadly yes, because reddit doesn't believe, that actions have consequences, and as an adult, you must accept that.", "I believe, that the brother isn't entitled to it either legally, or morally. The brother is just refusing to face the consequences of his actions. He wants to have it both ways.\n\n>family support his dad failed to give him\n\nWas the father supposed to support decisions he categorically disagreed with?", "he's definitely the asshole for sitting with his dad, and then keeping all of the inheritance when he was the one who wasn't treated like shit.", "This isn't \"am I legally right\".   This is \"am I the AH\".  \n\nWhether he legally has to share it or not doesn't matter.   It's whether he agrees with his homophobic father or not.", "it is disgustingly homophobic.\n\ni'm  a bi man. i've heard this all before.", "You can click on OP's profile and go to the comment section to see everything if you want! /gen\n\nThe way OP puts it does sound homophobic, and while yes, OP has every right to honor the dad's wishes and keep everything to himself, he just seems like he resents his brother for something he can't control and wants him to be punished for being himself. It's not far fetched that OP would turn out homophobic because of his dad. \n\nBesides, the dad had already disowned the brother before falling ill and taken him out of the will after discovering his condition.", "\n>That's \"you know what dad was like, you could have played it another way\".\n\nExcept OP's brother seems to have come out before their dad was diagnosed with cancer and op said their dad redid his will after the diagnostic. So how long should he have lied if not for the cancer ?\nIt must have taken OP's brother a lot of courage and honesty to live his life fully and openly knowing his father wouldn't approve.\n\n\n\n>They both knew their dad, they chose different ways to deal with it and both now live with the consequences of their respective decisions and following actions (sich as not visiting dad at the end)\n\n\nOp said in another comment that their dad changed his will to exclude his brother after being diagnosed. He chose to not have his other son by his side and stay hateful while dying.", "I mean you seem to think that I said that a guy dating a girl is being homophobic, which is clearly not the case since I'm a guy married to a girl.\n\nMaybe he has other issues with his brother, but he's focused on his brother dating a guy on the comments and how he should've just dated a girl. OP never really explained any other issue outside of his brother dating a guy. That is what makes his moral compass homophobic.", "You are not here to judge OP's brother's actions. You are here to judge OP's actions. And You chose to defend homophobic views and those view's consequences. Have a legally happy life.", "The thing is, loving a guy instead of a girl shouldn't have any bad consequences.\n\n>Was the father supposed to support decisions he categorically disagreed with?\r  \n\r\n\nYes, dad should've been able to see how backwards his views are and should've tried to fix his homophobic views. Instead he decided do disown his own son. \n\nI assume you're also against gay relationships?"]}
