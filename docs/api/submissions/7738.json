My brother is too young to get his drivers license (he\u2019s 17 and you have to be 18 in my country) and my mother simply decided to never get one. They always rely on me or my father to drive them everywhere, but since my father is out of town 4 days a week it\u2019s usually me who has to do it. This morning I had to drive them to the mall because my brother had an interview at a placement agency within that mall. My mother came with us and swore it would only take 15 minutes. I had lunch plans with a friend so I thought I could easily get there in time since the interview was at 11:30am and my friend would meet me at 12:30pm. The interview ended up taking a lot longer than 15 minutes (it took an hour and a half) and at that point I knew I wasn\u2019t going to make it for lunch (I had to take them home first so it would just take too long). It didn\u2019t bother me too much because obviously it was no one\u2019s fault. However, the second my mother and brother got into the car after the interview, they started arguing and yelling at each other (like they always do) and my mother got out of the car angrily and walked back into the mall. At this point I was really annoyed because I\u2019d already spent an hour and a half waiting for them in the car and missed my lunch plans and not only did my mother not show her gratitude at all, she decided to be childish and leave the car when I\u2019d been waiting for them long enough already. I got really mad that she did not take my time into account at all and decided to basically punish me by making me wait even longer. Eventually I decided that I\u2019d just drive home with my brother and I did. She has no way of getting home from the mall now and I guess I\u2019ll have to go get her later (which sucks), but I kind of wanted to teach her a lesson.

Stop driving your mom everywhere, she can figure out another way to get around.", "NTA but how old is your mom I haven't pulled some shit like that since I was 20 and off my meds", "NTA no dont go back later. Why are you rewarding the behaviour of  someone acting like a toddler.\n\nShe wont learn otherwise. And yes she can get back - taxi, call someone else to pick her up, take bus, start walking.\n\nYou want to be a taxi service  - fine but then act like one. You pick them up at the time they say, if they are late you go.  5 mins leeway given only unless of a medical emergency.", "Info: did you have the lunch plans before committing to the interview drive? If you had already committed to driving him for the interview before the luncheon YTA. \n\nESH- I'm assuming this isn't your car in this scenario because you didn't explicitly state this was your personal car. So the family car was needed to get the brother to an interview, which sounds like it went well. You could have tried to make a better effort with your family to be at the lunch and return to the mall for the pick up. I don't disagree with the punishment you gave your mother for the way she acted. I do think this whole thing could have been avoided if you all acted the adults you are supposed to be. Maybe next time just try and schedule and communicate more and this problem probably wouldn't be that serious.", "INFO: how is brother going to get to his job if he\u2019s hired?", "NTA\n\n1) Your family members are chronically inconsiderate of your time and plans\n\n2) Once again they blow up your plans for a lunch meet, although I'd give at least a little grace for the fact that your brother probably couldn't control how long the interview process ran\n\n3) They come back to the car and start fighting and your mom decides to take it out on you as well by storming off.\n\nLet her take a freaking taxi home and start enforcing some boundaries for basic, decent behavior toward those who are helping out.", "They knew I had plans.

Tbh they didn\u2019t \u201cask\u201d. My mom said \u201cyour brother has an interview tomorrow and you have to take us there\u201d. To be fair we live in a small town and the mall is in a different town so a taxi would be too expensive and there isn\u2019t a bus that can take them there. Uber isn\u2019t a thing in my country so that\u2019s not an option either. And I did use my personal car to drive them - my dad has his own car with him as he\u2019s out of town, but either way even if we had a third car my mom wouldn\u2019t be able to drive it because as I\u2019ve said, she doesn\u2019t have a license", "Stop changing or cancelling your plans for them then. Tough love", "But you deserve the treatment - because you cancelled.  They've learnt you will always wait and cancel your plans. \n\nBefore you take them anywhere you give them the exact time and say after 5 mins you will drive off. Then you do.", "Was there no way you couldn't have dropped them off for the interview and mall trip, attended the lunch and then returned to pick up? This seems like a very simple solution that day. \n\nI don't know why your mother and brother were arguing when they entered the car but something was wrong and you didn't have the patience to wait anymore. I don't blame you for this tbh I probably would have left a long time before you. Unfortunately you left your mother there and will now have to go back to pick her up. Did that make your life easier? Did it make you feel better to punish her? Or do you now need to drag yourself back and probably endure an even worse car ride with your own mother. \n\nYou have two working vehicles and two licenced drivers for four people. One car and one person is gone for four days. Can you not pick up the slack and help out? Families are supposed to support and care for each other. I know it's hard to take the higher road sometimes but it will always be the best option imho. \n\nStill sticking to ESH"]}
