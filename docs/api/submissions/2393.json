She will frantically text me and other coworkers to see if we can cover, or she calls out right before her shift and my manager scrambles to find coverage.\n\nShe said that she didn\u2019t get paid enough at this job (probably because you don\u2019t work the hours you\u2019re given) so she went and got another job that pays a dollar more. After that, she changed her availability to Monday-Wednesday only at my job. She gets those three days if she\u2019s lucky, but not always.\n\nWell this week she has those three shifts mon-wed,and on Sunday night she texts me to ask if I work on monday. I didn\u2019t, but I didn\u2019t say anything because it was pretty late and she could have assumed I was already asleep. \n\nWell today, just now before her shift in two hours, she texts me to ask if I\u2019m working again because she had a \u201cfamily emergency\u201d pop up and her dad needs her. I was asleep and didn\u2019t see the text and then she called me two times in a row. I didn\u2019t answer either of them.\n\nI don\u2019t know if she\u2019s being honest because she calls out at least once a week.

He was nice enough to ask me to come in after my class which ends at 6, so I would only have to be there for a few hours but I don\u2019t know what to tell him??? I feel like if I give in then I\u2019m just feeding into her continuing to call out like this.\n\nUPDATE: I told my manager that she tried to contact me both Sunday and this morning, and that I was not going to be coming in today because I need to focus on school. He was super understanding about it, and I\u2019m sure we will talk more about it my next shift. I know my manager is already well aware but I am going to reiterate that she is unreliable and that resentment does build amongst coworkers when you let things slide for one person and the rest of the team has to pick up the slack.
