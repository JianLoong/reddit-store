She\u2019s still fairly new but she does things that really aggravate me. First of all, there hasn\u2019t been one full week that she hasn\u2019t called off. She will frantically text me and other coworkers to see if we can cover, or she calls out right before her shift and my manager scrambles to find coverage.\n\nShe said that she didn\u2019t get paid enough at this job (probably because you don\u2019t work the hours you\u2019re given) so she went and got another job that pays a dollar more. After that, she changed her availability to Monday-Wednesday only at my job. She gets those three days if she\u2019s lucky, but not always.\n\nWell this week she has those three shifts mon-wed,and on Sunday night she texts me to ask if I work on monday. I didn\u2019t, but I didn\u2019t say anything because it was pretty late and she could have assumed I was already asleep. \n\nWell today, just now before her shift in two hours, she texts me to ask if I\u2019m working again because she had a \u201cfamily emergency\u201d pop up and her dad needs her. I was asleep and didn\u2019t see the text and then she called me two times in a row. I didn\u2019t answer either of them.\n\nI don\u2019t know if she\u2019s being honest because she calls out at least once a week. And I sure as hell don\u2019t want to go in because I am already the main person to cover days when we\u2019re short staffed, I\u2019ve been working through the weekend for 4 months straight now. I got today off because I have a college class in the middle of the day and while I could skip it, I already spend too much time at my job when I\u2019m in school full time.\n\nI\u2019m praying that my manager doesn\u2019t ask me to work the closing shift bc she didn\u2019t show up, but that\u2019s usually what happens and then I have to push through my anxiety to say no.\n\nThere\u2019s a possibility she\u2019s truly having a family emergency, but she cries wolf and calls out so much that I don\u2019t know what to believe.\n\nAITA for ignoring her?\n\nUPDATE: just got the \u201chey can you cover\u201d text from my manager that I was dreading. He was nice enough to ask me to come in after my class which ends at 6, so I would only have to be there for a few hours but I don\u2019t know what to tell him??? I feel like if I give in then I\u2019m just feeding into her continuing to call out like this.", "created_utc": 1668529509, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yw1zr1/aita_for_ignoring_my_coworker_who_has_a_family/", "score": 92, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Just copy and paste the responses folks wrote out for you and text it to your manager. \n\nTruthfully, this shouldn\u2019t be y\u2019all\u2019s responsibility to find shift coverage for each other last minute. Management is responsible for scheduling, and it\u2019s not appropriate for employees to give their coworkers  \u201creasons\u201d (especially emotionally laden ones) as to why they need shift coverage. Even if someone is scheduled ahead of time and wants the day off (and informs the manager at the beginning of the two week schedule), it\u2019s more appropriate for the manager to find shift coverage because again, they\u2019re responsible for creating the schedule. It\u2019ll also give employees ample time to prepare for the change and have arrangements in place.\n\nIf someone is constantly calling out demanding that everyone cover for them, it should be up to management to deal with that employee.

We got a new coworker, who loudly announced that he would \\*never\\* cover for someone else, so don't ask. Three weeks in a row, he called in on my Monday off, and the manager asked me to cover. The last time, I told my manager that, while I was happy to help, this was going way over and beyond. I told him that I would no longer answer texts on Monday, but that if it were a true emergency, he could call. The manager admitted that rather than confront my coworker about why he was \\*always\\* calling out on his first day of the week (we all knew it was to play video games and smoke pot!), he'd just pushed it off onto me. After this, I still got text and calls to cover for others, but the leech was on his own.", "I finally replied and told my manager that I will not be covering for her tonight as I need to focus on school. I also made him aware that she reached out to me both days trying to get me to cover, but I didn\u2019t say anything about having a meeting with her. He is more than aware of this situation and I trust him to handle it. He said he appreciated that I got back to him and he figured he would ask to see if I wanted a couple of extra hours for this week. Thank you all for giving me some courage to speak up about it and say no to not over-extend myself.", "That\u2019s awesome! Good on you for standing up for yourself.
