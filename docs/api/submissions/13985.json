Sounds like financial abuse to me. Is your husband usually this controlling? \n\nThat said, you won the gift card so technically this is *your* money *your* rule. Bring your bff! You get to decide who to spend the money on and your bff will bring you more joy. Honestly I\u2019d use it for girls night entirely and leave your husband at home. Go eat a ton of food and get a ton of drinks and have a blast without the guys cramping your style!", "NTA", "NTA it\u2019s you\u2019re money to do wish as you please. This is a good example of how social capital works though. Obviously, gifts and favors should be extended without the assumption of being \u201cpaid back\u201d later. Yet, if you\u2019re always in the receiving end (taking from you social capital) and never on the giving end (adding to your social capital) eventually your social capital will run out (think of it as a bank account). You have to refill to continue receiving the benefits of social capital. \n\nIf you\u2019re always asking for friends to help you move apartments but never show up when friends need help moving, eventually no one is going to want to help you move. Humans evolved to (unconsciously) recognize and avoid one sided relationships. \n\nThe whole theory is much more complicated and takes into account that things are always a 1 to 1 exchange, but this is just as a brief example of evolutionary psychology in action! \n\nDon\u2019t feel bad, the choice to take your BFF is the same choice humans have been making for millennia and it\u2019s one reason we\u2019ve been so successful.", "NTA It\u2019s your money spend it on who you want.", "Just take your BFF.

You won this so you get to choose who you invite.", "NTA. \n\nI would take off and only treat my bff (and maybe another one of our friends or a close female relative). \n\nI\u2019d leave hubby and his brother on their own.
