Here\u2019s a backstory. \n\nMy mom (Alma 48) and her bf (Jeff 50) have been together for about 4 years. Jeff has 3 kids from he previous marriage (Annie 9, Taylor 13, and Jessica 20). \nMy mom raised us (4 kids now adults 20-30) as a single mother and of course we would argue growing up like normal kids but in the end we always listened and helped each other out.\n\nJeff\u2019s kids are the most spoiled people ever. At least how they were raised. He\u2019s been struggling to make ends meet since the divorce and my mom helps him with deliveries so he can pay his bills. His ex wife doesn\u2019t help out with anything but loves to post online what a terrible father he is even though he\u2019s the only one supporting all the kids. \n\nJessica is the worst. She\u2019s 20 and refuses to work. She refuses to clean. She doesn\u2019t even do her own laundry. Unfortunately Jeff still does everything for her and doesn\u2019t understand that he needs to put her foot down. She\u2019s also so mean to my mom when she asks her to clean up after herself. But my mom doesn\u2019t take any of that. And she\u2019ll never try to argue. She\u2019ll tell Jeff so he can take care of it because she knows she\u2019s not her mom. \n\n\nHere\u2019s where we might be the asshole. \nWe\u2019re all currently at a family trip in another state for the weekend. We had a strict itinerary planned so we can make the most of it. Everyone was reminded a million times that we needed to leave the Airbnb to the theme park that\u2019s an hour away. We planned on leaving all together at 8:30. My mom calls me (I\u2019m staying at a hotel close by) saying they\u2019re running late which was totally fine. I show up around 9:30 and Jessica still has not showered or gotten ready. My mom told me they tried telling her to get ready a bunch of times but she would just walk around the home and play on her phone. (Her phone only works on wifi because Jeff was tired of her refusing to do work or do anything and kicked her out of the phone plan and his apartment to live with her cheap mom who doesn\u2019t want to pay for her phone bill.)  Jessica had been up since 8 and hopped in the shower at 10. We told her she had ten minutes to get ready or we\u2019d leave her. She argued that she had to shower and get ready but we all said we\u2019re leaving without her if she didn\u2019t get out. We decided since she was taking her sweet time, she didn\u2019t need the wifi. We unplugged it and went to the car. We waited in the car for another 10 minutes before leaving. We left. The Airbnb has a pool and a tv with no cable so she\u2019ll survive. \n\nI\u2019ve never left anyone like this and I do feel a little bad. I know she\u2019ll rant to her mom and she\u2019ll post about this everywhere. Are we the asshole for leaving her at the Airbnb?", "created_utc": 1688223057, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14nwzqg/aita_for_leaving_a_family_member_in_the_airbnb/", "score": 29, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You guys should have left her at 8:30. Never let a person who is late dictate the schedule for everyone else. She's doing it on purpose as a means of control so you need to not play into that.", "NTA.\n\nShe had two hours to get ready to go. More than that, really, since the original plan was to *leave* at 8:30, so everyone was probably up before 8 until the running late thing happened.\n\nBesides, she's twenty years old.

She's an adult, she needs to start acting like one", "NTA - I have this issue with an extended family member, and we have always said, if you're not ready to go when it's time to leave, you can stay behind.  She tried to call our bluff, but after doing it a couple of times, she's ready when it's time to go.", "NTA\n\nYou guys should've left her back home with her mom. \n\nAlso, in the future, leave at the designated time. She will learn or she won't. But Uber is everywhere.", "NTA I would have left at 9:30! She is an adult", "NTA I would have left at 8:30 as planned", "Nta, should have done that 30-40 minutes earlier.", "This will probably be a deeply unpopular judgement and I expect to get downvoted for it, but:\n\nESH\n\nJessica has some pretty obvious issues, but I really don't see how you're much better than her. Honestly, from where I'm sitting, I'd rather deal with her than with you . . . you seem like one of those people who spent their school years snitching on everyone and minding everyone's business except your own. It's obnoxious. \n\nYou certainly aren't obligated to like Jessica, and you have every right to complain about any aspect of her behaviour that DIRECTLY AFFECTS YOU (e.g. if she were to make you late for your plans). And you're not an AH for choosing to leave her there when she dawdled around and wasn't ready to go on time. \n\nBut ultimately, literally NONE of the rest of this is any of your business. Her day-to-day life outside your vacations? None of your business. Whether she works or not? None of your business. She doesn't clean up after herself? Is spoiled? Is mean to your mom? You don't have to like her, but ultimately your mother and her boyfriend are adults, and how she navigates her relationship with him and his kids is . . . say it with me now: not yours to deal with. \n\nYou don't mention your age, but given that you say that you and your siblings are all between 20-30, you can't be much older than Jessica is, and yet you're acting like a third parent. Again, you weren't an AH for leaving her behind. But also, this is a total overstep and makes you a massive AH:\n\n>We decided since she was taking her sweet time, she didn\u2019t need the wifi. We unplugged it and went to the car\n\nUnless \"we\" included your mother and/or Jeff, it wasn't your place to \"punish\" her or make any decisions at all about what another person nearly your age did or didn't \"need\" because you were pissed at her. Again, you're not her parent. You don't get to make those decisions. And frankly, it's super weird that you keep talking like you ARE her parent and deserve to make any decisions at all regarding someone who is essentially your peer. \n\nShe's clearly a PITA, but from the sound of it, so are you . . . nosy, bossy, and controlling.
