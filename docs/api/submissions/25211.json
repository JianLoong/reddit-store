He abused me as a kid, and I always kind of repressed that. He was my hero when I was a kid, and it was hard to wrap my head around why he would do such a thing to me. It wasn't until I met my Fianc\u00e9e that I began to realize the destruction this trauma had caused and I began to try and heal.\n\nMy father was a sales executive with a multinational drilling equipment company for 35 years so needless to say he made a lot of money. However, he fell on hard times when he was laid off years ago and got duped by everyone's favorite televangelist, Kenneth Copeland, into giving most of his money away to \"ministry\". He struggled for a while, working whatever jobs he could to provide for himself (65) and my little sister (16).\n\nI'm a Realtor and my Fianc\u00e9e has her Master's degree working in the education industry so together we make quite a comfortable living for ourselves. I paid my dad's rent more times than I can count and bought them food quite often. They lived over an hour away, so it was a bit hard to visit them often but I made sure they were taken care of, and I always assumed my brother did the same, as he makes great money as well.\n\nLast year, I put together a plan to get a large house and have my dad and sister move in with us. We could help my sister stay on track with school and I could work to help him get back on his feet with work. It was rough, as the financial burden was significant and raising a troubled 16 year old is hard, but we did it and it's worked out well. She's on track and he got his old job back.\n\nDuring these struggles he was having, he opened up to me that my brother had pretty much refused to help. He never helped my dad financially except for gas money a couple times so he could get to work. It's his money, he can do what he wants, but I would've expected him to help the man that had allowed him and his wife to live in our house rent free for three years.\n\nThe final straw, for me, was this past week. My dad loves talking to his sons about our lives, he's a caring and compassionate man that loves celebrating our successes and counseling us in our failures. My dad was talking with him, because he wanted to set up a day to bring my niece's birthday presents over to their house. My brother let it slip that they were setting up for her birthday party, and even though he tried to hide it, my dad was heartbroken that he hadn't been invited. You could hear it in his voice. I assume my brother heard this, because he gave my dad a \"pity invite\" after this.\n\nMy dad still went, but I could tell he was hurt. I'm used to it. I haven't been invited to a birthday party for either of their kids in at least 4 years and I wasn't even invited to their baby shower last year, but I was absolutely crushed for my dad.\n\nI want to uninvite him from my wedding, and plan on telling my dad and fianc\u00e9e today, but I don't want to make a bad emotional decision.

NTA for the desire to uninvite him for the callous way he treats both you and your father but you will not feel good in your progress of recovery from him if you blind side him on the wedding invite. \n\nIt's the decent thing to communicate and have things laid out on the table, not because he deserves it, but because how you choose to approach this situation will sit with you for a long time. This sounds like it will likely be the crux of a final severance between your father, you and your brother.\n\nSo, at very least you just tell him / message him as you laid out here that the way he treated your father was the last straw and unkind. That he shouldn't hold expectations to be invited to important family events if he doesn't care to offer the same considerations in return, especially to people who are his family. \n\nI wish you well on the wedding and your healing from your brother's past abuse on you.

I would do the same. But, your father is old and sentimental and loves to talk about his sons. A wedge between you and your brother may crush your father more, and who knows what it would do to his mental health. So, please do not do anything without consulting people who you trust their judgment and who know all of you. My recommendation is to have a civil but distant relationship with him. Maybe making plans for revenge diminishes your anger until the correct time comes. You asked before making an emotional decision, this is smart. Good luck.", "First paragraph.
