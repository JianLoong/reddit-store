The parents should share with their kids in the master and you should get the smallest room. As a parent, I can\u2019t imagine having another adult share a room with my kid instead of me.", "NTA. A set of parents can stay with the children in the master. Why would you get stuck kids when you don\u2019t have kids? Selfish parents!", "NTA and Em\u2019s husband is the hero - he spilled the beans before you paid for this train wreck", "On behalf of single people everywhere who get stuck at the \"kids' table\", ruthlessly co-opted as vacation babysitters, and crippled from sleeping on the couch because \"the guestroom is for married couples\": OHH HELL NAW. \n\nIf you pay a third, you get one of the three bedrooms. End of discussion.\n\nBless Em for levelling with you, and please renew your offer -- to her -- to share a weekend at a spa resort. \n\nBut Nikki sounds like a sneaky opportunist. You're probably done there. Tell your mom and sister that if they want to go play camp counsellor, there's a set of bunkbeds with their names on them!\n\nNTA to back out OP, and I bet you'll be more wary from now on.", "INFO: What did you say to Nikki during the argument? \n\nYou're more than likely not TA, but that kind of vague reference is often how people try to hide something monstrous they did or said.", "NTA! I can't get over the room having 4 sets of bunk beds... 8 beds! how many younglings does everyone have??  \n\n\nThe Sleeping arrangement should be.. \n\nYou in the smallest room, Em and her husband in the middle room, Nikki, her husband and all the kids in the mega bunk dorm room with all the children.  \n\n\nObviously the ideal would be that she booked a place that was actually appropriate, but it is what it is.  If Nikki is fine with adults having to room with other peoples children, then Nikki should be the one to do it.", "**NTA** \n\nThe kids should sleep with their parents in the same room and you get the smallest room.  Nikki and her husband are being very selfish and inconsiderate by expecting you to sleep in the same room as their kids. \n\nIf you were to agree to this you should be paying a much smaller % - not 1/3!\n\nIt sounds like Nikki\u2019s husband wants to make this a vacation around *him* at your expense.", "NTA\n\nGet out of this trip now. It is no longer a 20 year anniversary of your friendship, it's been hijacked to be family trips for them. You are already stuck rooming with all these kids, won't be surprised if they ask you to babysit so they can have a dinner just for them and their husbands.  Maybe this rooming situation was done specifically so you will drop out, no matter what this seems like a lousy trip for you. Go to the spa resort on your own, sounds better than this mess.", "NTA.  It\u2019s not cool AND disrespectful.  You\u2019re being treated like a toddler.", "NTA. You're paying for your own room, you should get your own room. If you can't have your own room that you're paying for, why would you go? It's not your fault Nikki didn't choose a place with enough room for everyone, & it's not on you to make everything okay when her thoughtlessness caused the problem in the first place.", "NTA. \n\nFree babysitter, etc and so on.\n\nYou have the right to your own room and space away from the children, considering you're the one that isn't a parent.\n\nGood on Em's husband for contacting you. And for he and Em having your back. Don't doubt yourself.", "NTA- your friend is trying to make you a free babysitter!!!!\n\nHeck no!!!!!!!!!!", "NTA and this is why I insist on booking the place myself when going with a group. I\u2019d rather be responsible for tracking down everybody for the money than being told where I will be sleeping", "NTA, I'm sorry that this \"friend\" is trying to take advantage of you. She is using you to help pay for a family vacation. That is beyond messed up.", "NTA. You ONLY pay 1/3 if you get 1/3 of space and private area portion. If you were to bunk with the kids, you should only pay 1/3 of 1/3 (or around that). Others might argue upping it for the rest of the amenities and setup (like if the bedroom has its own bathroom). But regardless, 1/3 is a \"NO\" and then there is the issue of why the heck you would need to sleep with the kids! I would ask if the bunk beds could be moved! I saw that once actually, a cabin in Northern California had X many bedrooms and the bunks were in the upstairs landing, not in a private room, 2 or more bunk bed sets. I was only there one or 2 nights with family and slept in one of them since everyone were staying there for a week (and no one asked me for money). Yeah, only go if you get your own private room.", "That\u2019s what I thought too! I\u2019ve literally never even met most of these kids, and the two I have met were babies at the time.", "Bunk rooms are relatively common in vacation homes where we\u2019re from (or at least they aren\u2019t unheard of). Em and Nikki both have three kids, so six total between them. Nikki\u2019s youngest has Down\u2019s Syndrome, she wanted her to be in their room and not in the bunk room with the kids. That\u2019s why she was saying she needed the room with the two full size beds and not the smallest room with the queen. Why they couldn\u2019t all sleep in the bunk room, I do not know.", "I would bet Nikki\u2019s husband didn\u2019t want to take care of all the kids for a weekend and suggested a \u201cfamily trip\u201d instead.", "And would probably be treated as a babysitter too. Why wouldn't she want to \"help\" with the kids?", "My thoughts exactly", "When I go with my brother and his family on jaunts like this, I book a hotel room for myself and just hang out with them.  Then I get my own room and don't have to deal with kids before breakfast.", "I wondered that too but left it out of my response."]}
