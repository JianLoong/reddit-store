My sister used to be a rational and kind person, but when her son was growing up i noticed that she didn't put any limit on him. He run arround our parent's house and broke a lot of things on purpose, and still throw tantrums when my parents try to correct him. When our parents do that, she comes running and argues with them saying that her son is like that because he is autistic. However, there is no proof of this. I've taken her to consultations with autism specialists and everyone said her son wasn't autistic, but she keeps telling people he is to justify his bad behavior. \n\nLast week was my niece's birthday (my brother's daughter) and everyone in the family was there. My sister's son started throwing a tantrum when he saw that the cake wasn't for him. He started screaming, crying and trying to destroy the cake. Fortunately my brother stopped him in time, but when he caught him, my sister came running saying that he couldn't use physical force against a child, because \"he is an autistic child\". I just couldn't bear to hear that, I was already off limits. I yelled at my sister and told her her son is not autistic but a spoiled brat with no boundaries and poorly raised. She looked at me in shock and many family members looked the same. \n\nShe left with her son without waiting for the cake and then sent me dozens of messages saying that I was an asshole, prejudiced against autistic people and that she expected an apology. I really like my sister, and now I think maybe I overreacted by yelling at her at a family event.

He'll usually drive our daughter and, if we decide that our son can handle going, I'll drive him separately and he and I will leave early once we see that he's reached his limit on being able to behave properly. Since COVID, I'll typically just stay home with our son and my husband will take our daughter to things like that because she's capable of behaving herself like her neurotypical peers. We also never leave our son unattended when around others so we can redirect him away from misbehaving. Having an autistic child is a full time job and your sister is failing at it spectacularly if that's the label she wants to put on him.\n\nI hate when people try to use \"the autism card\" to try and get away with poor behavior like this and, if you making a scene was what it took for her to remove an overstimulated, misbehaving child from the party, then that is what needed to happen.", "Autism isn't an excuse for that behaviour anyway.\n\nI'm autistic.

That's even more upsetting, because she's just allowing a badly behaved child to represent people with autism, and others who don't actually know the facts, watch his behavior and think that that's what autism is like.

Telling her, in your nephew's presence (I assume) that he's a \"spoiled brat\" is a rough thing to say of a child in front of him and the rest of the family. Everyone has their limits though. He sounds difficult to be around. Your sister attempting to apply an unconfirmed diagnosis to him to justify not having to discipline him would be even harder to take. \n\nNo, you don't owe her an apology.

By contrast, you called your brother's daughter your \"niece.\" It leaves the impression that you don't like your nephew.
