I've taken her to consultations with autism specialists and everyone said her son wasn't autistic, but she keeps telling people he is to justify his bad behavior. \n\nLast week was my niece's birthday (my brother's daughter) and everyone in the family was there. My sister's son started throwing a tantrum when he saw that the cake wasn't for him. He started screaming, crying and trying to destroy the cake. Fortunately my brother stopped him in time, but when he caught him, my sister came running saying that he couldn't use physical force against a child, because \"he is an autistic child\". I just couldn't bear to hear that, I was already off limits. I yelled at my sister and told her her son is not autistic but a spoiled brat with no boundaries and poorly raised. She looked at me in shock and many family members looked the same. \n\nShe left with her son without waiting for the cake and then sent me dozens of messages saying that I was an asshole, prejudiced against autistic people and that she expected an apology.

But i guess especially as a child if it came out he is autistic even though he is so high-functionating, it could have impacted his school-life negative, children are unfortunately cruel and many still see autism as something bad. So if being undiagnosed really never hinders him before like making friends, being happy and so, i think it was the right decision. But maybe ask himself.", "I'm on the spectrum and didn't really know officially until recently. I was a WEIRD fucking kid with poor social skills and still a weird adult although I've adjusted. I ended up becoming a special ed teacher and realized what was up. Last year I finally got an eval and everything makes sense. Doesn't really change anything, but back in the 80s if you weren't a big problem nothing really was done mental health wise.", "Have you told him you suspect he may be autistic? I literally just was talking about my newborn to my mom last week, he's about 2 months old, and really does not do eye contact. So she mentioned autism and I was like... you realize I am actually autistic? I had never mentioned it before honestly because I did not want anyone to look at me differently or treat me differently. Anyway, she goes \"Yeah, I suspected it for years\" And I was just thinking wtf? Why would you not tell me you suspected that so that I could be tested? It literally took what felt like ages for me to realize omg, I have all these things in common, maybe I am autistic. And I absolutely would have loved to know sooner. But I will say, I am glad I seemed to be above the wave of kids being diagnosed. I feel like there were high expectations of me for behavior and achievement that would not have been there with a diagnosis. I would have loved some noise blocking headphones though, especially when doing my homework. Also, for the love of God they need to change the lighting in schools.", "The post said the doctors said he wasn't autistic. Please read the post again.", "Thank you. I am doing my best. It's a lot to learn crash course style. Sometimes I feel lost in it all.\n\nWhat matters is the kid!", "I wasn't rude. But you were insulting and judgmental. I suggest you comport yourself more properly in the future when inserting yourself into a conversation.", "So what?", "She *claims* the specialists told her sister that the kid wasn't autistic. I don't know why she would be present for that conversation and it would be a violation of HIPPA for them to have told her directly without the parents approval. \n\nDiagnosis is also sometimes a rather lengthy process, requiring multiple visits and sometimes waiting periods. Some providers will also refuse to or be extremely hesitant to diagnose people outside of certain age ranges, and at 9 years old, the kid is actually significantly older than a lot of providers are used to dealing with. It's not nearly as simple as people tend to think. I can totally see OP taking a statement like \"they didn't confirm he was autistic today\" as \"they confirmed he wasn't autistic\" and running with it. \n\nAs far as not producing a 'diagnosis' goes, writeups of psychiatric diagnostic procedures can contain a lot of very sensitive information and are something I would hope wouldn't just get handed out willy-nilly to nosy family members, even if it existed. \n\nBottom line, the way that assertion was made just seems really fishy to me - it could be true, I certainly can't prove it's not, but there's enough reasons to doubt it that I'm not willing to take it at face vale.", ">The post said the doctors said he wasn't autistic. Please read the post again.\n\nI read the post. I know what it said. I'm saying I have doubts about whether what it said accurately reflects the truth. \n\nIf the 'doctors' told OP directly that he wasn't autistic without the parents permission, it would be a pretty extreme HIPAA violation. I don't understand why they would give permission if it conflicted with their own assertions, and with \"driving them to appointments\" being the only reasoning provided as to why OP would have access to that information, yeah, I'm a bit skeptical.", "But that wouldn't be therapy because the kid is autistic, it's just therapy because he's entitled. The commenter said that autistic kids need therapy to deal with their autism, which is unrelated to what you said about this child needing therapy. \nI agree, this kid has some issues, but they seem to be disconnected from autism, and autism centred therapy shouldn't be required.", "Once upon a time my middle child threatened to burn my house down with me in it \ud83e\udd72  \n\nI worked hard at making sure I had the tools needed to help him to work through his struggles , feel understood and better self regulate", "I suggest you not tone police people. Have the day you deserve \ud83e\uddff\u270c\ufe0f", "Well, it seems if he was diagnosed with autism, the sister would be shouting about it from the rooftops, saying to OP \"See, I told you so!\"", "You read the post and created your own narrative in your head.", "You\u2019re making a major assumption that OP\u2019s sister didn\u2019t allow her to stay in the room during the consultation. Also the \u201cdoctors\u201d in quotations implies you don\u2019t think they were actual doctors. If you don\u2019t think OP is a reliable narrator then just say so.", "Well I drive my mom to appointments and you'd be shocked at how much they've told me! Also, do we even know what country she's in?", ">No need to be rude\n\nbut \n\n>I suggest you not tone police people\n\nWow, lol", "I'm doubting one detail of the narrative that was given in the post. I don't think that's really the same thing as creating a new one.", "Putting 'doctors' in quotations was simply to acknowledge that not all people who are involved in the evaluation for and diagnosis of autism are actually technically doctors (medical or otherwise). There are also plenty of autism specialists who may provide services without an official diagnosis who *usually* aren't doctors. \n\nI also don't think it's that major of an assumption that OP wouldn't have been in the room for consultations/evaluations - even OP's *sister* may not have been in the room for some evaluations, and if there's not a very good reason for someone to be present, usually they stay in the waiting area - it's not a \"let her stay in the room\" situation so much as a \"why would she have ever been in the room\" situation.", "Good point, I don't know where they're located. It's not like other countries don't have privacy laws though.", "Meltdowns are far closer to panic attacks then to tantrums", "And I stand behind my statement that Tantrums and meltdowns are very different. Saying they're the same is like saying the tears you cry when you skin your knee is the same as the tears you cry when you lose a loved one. They're very different.", "So you\u2019re calling her a liar when she stated that at the consultation everyone said the son wasn\u2019t autistic?", "Who cares?", "And I stand by my statement that they look the same to the casual observer. Either way, what difference does it make in this situation?", "I'm expressing doubt over what the actual status of her son's evaluation is. \n\nTo be fair, OP never actually said that \"everyone\" told *her personally* he wasn't autistic, it could be a misinterpretation or a misrepresentation of second-hand information. Or she could be outright lying - not like people never do that. Or it could be completely true - it's not unheard of for psychologists to casually violate privacy laws, especially for family members. It's not unheard of for people who really have no reason to be privy to information to get waivers that allow them to be privy to it. \n\nAll I'm saying is that I see enough reasons to doubt this particular assertion that I'm not taking it as absolute fact. It's also not *really* all that relevant, so I don't get why everyone is getting all bent out of shape about it.", "All the people who are replying to you.
