I've taken her to consultations with autism specialists and everyone said her son wasn't autistic, but she keeps telling people he is to justify his bad behavior. \n\nLast week was my niece's birthday (my brother's daughter) and everyone in the family was there. My sister's son started throwing a tantrum when he saw that the cake wasn't for him. He started screaming, crying and trying to destroy the cake. Fortunately my brother stopped him in time, but when he caught him, my sister came running saying that he couldn't use physical force against a child, because \"he is an autistic child\". I just couldn't bear to hear that, I was already off limits. I yelled at my sister and told her her son is not autistic but a spoiled brat with no boundaries and poorly raised. She looked at me in shock and many family members looked the same. \n\nShe left with her son without waiting for the cake and then sent me dozens of messages saying that I was an asshole, prejudiced against autistic people and that she expected an apology.

The symptoms are the same, but since girls are forced to mask at a very early age, the *expression* of those symptoms are often different.", "I was diagnosed with autism as an adult. There are advantages to being diagnosed younger because there are interventions. \n\nFor example, I had trouble with social situations. I didn\u2019t understand social standards. For example, I didn\u2019t understand the song and dance of just saying \u201chi, how are you.\u201d \u201cFine, and you?\u201d It had no point to me because people didn\u2019t actually share how they were. I now understand to treat it just as an extension of a greeting and an acknowledgement that you know someone. Similarly I didn\u2019t understand social cues, have trouble identifying other\u2019s emotions, and have issues trying to figure out how to act in many situation. This is compounded by the fact that I\u2019m female and expected to automatically understand these things (and also why I didn\u2019t get diagnosed until I was an adult). Having a diagnosis would have helped me realize why I was different and that it was \u201cok.\u201d It also might have given me access to people and things that could help me understand the world better. But as it was I was an incredibly awkward kid who didn\u2019t understand how to interact with people. I was filled with a lot of doubt because I couldn\u2019t make sense of alot of society and reading other\u2019s emotions. I\u2019m also not saying that an autistic individual needs to change the way they act to fit society - however people generally find it helpful to understand why people act certain ways. \n\nAnother example - if he had been diagnosed then he might realize he is having problems and can more readily identify ways to fix them. Let\u2019s say he lives in a dorm room. He finds that he has headaches often but doesn\u2019t understand why. Eventually he figures out that he gets a headaches after studying in his room for a couple of hours. But he doesn\u2019t know why. If he knew autism was a possible diagnosis, he might realize that it wasn\u2019t studying that gave him a headache. It was the overhead light in his room. Individuals with autism sometimes have sensitivities to lights, sounds, etc. So the lights give him a headache. So The simplest solution would be to quit using his overhead light and to use a desk lamp. But he has to know to consider such things as a potential problem first. \n\nSo I would recommend that you mention it to him. He might have automatically thought \u201cwell, my parents never mentioned autism so I don\u2019t have it.\u201d He doesn\u2019t have to pursue a diagnosis unless he wants to. If he is in school, they likely offer student mental health services. They might have a no-cost way for him to get tested. A diagnosis would also let him get reasonable classroom or living accommodations if he needs them. But like I said, he doesn\u2019t have to get diagnosed. If he knows that he is possibly autistic then this might open his mind up to problems/solutions he didn\u2019t think of otherwise.", "\"other therapies [that help autistic people]\" would be the context for their comment", "A diagnosis is useful if accommodations are needed in school or a job, or if daily living skills are impaired.

I have NVLD though, similar to Asperger's but not the same.", "i was diagnosed as a college aged kid, and i seemed like there\u2019s no problem to be fixed. but i had so many issues that i didnt even realised were issues and blamed myself for secretly. the diagnosis mostly helped me to understand why i act how i do, unmask without shame or guilt (which was a huge thing for me) and find resources/community to help me navigate the world without shame.", "I just got diagnosed last spring, at age 37, and while I'm mostly on the milder end myself, and don't really need any extra specialist help or anything, I have found it helpful to have the diagnosis just for the times I notice that my brain isn't braining like most people. It's an \"Oh, it's not because I'm broken and a bad human. I'm autistic and my brain is different.\" \n\nOn the other hand, my therapist totally blocked me on everything once we had a diagnosis. I'd ask him if we could work on my depression and anxiety and he'd be all \"You're autistic, we can't fix it, not my problem. Have you considered disability?\" when all I wanted was learning to rething negative thoughts. And when I complained, he used my diagnosis against me. Thankfully I am a pretty functional adult even without help, but yeah.\n\nHaving a diagnosis has been inwardly very helpful, but outwardly not so much.", "Chiming in here to say I\u2019m also autistic and CBT was *hugely* helpful to me.  I\u2019m sorry it wasn\u2019t helpful to you; I found examining the way I thought about things critically to be of enormous benefit to me.  Finding out that there was little, if any, empirical evidence for most of my negative self-talk was life-altering on a level I don\u2019t even have words for.", "You\u2019re an adult. My son is 11 yo. \n\nHe has all the supports and doctors, etc.. \n\nIt\u2019s his right to decide how he wants to present himself. Not mine. It\u2019s his decision. Completely. \n\nMy son is aware of his dx, the super powers it brings, and the obstacles. \n\nI super appreciate your comment. It\u2019s just that this isn\u2019t my information to share, it\u2019s his. \n\nHe knows this. He appreciates that I respect his autonomy.", "Both extremes are bad. My mom kinda made me feel like she was ashamed to even tell people.\n\nI was diagnosed late (20) and it was hard going to a mainstream school. I'm very traumatized by that. I had no understanding of why I was different or what I could do to improve things. Not my mom's fault, she first figured out I was autistic when she saw a show about it. But the damage was done by that point.", "My parents did this with me. They wanted me to understand why I thought differently to other people, but that it was nothing to be ashamed of or mask. Unfortunately, when I was in prep, my teacher and the students wanted to make sure that I felt bad for my differences. My parents moved me out of that school as soon as they could, but unfortunately the damage was already done. For the next 6 years, I masked who I was and acted neurotypical in order to avoid the pain of being ridiculed 7 hours a day 5 days a week again. And it was successful, until I was bullied again in year 6. \n\nThat broke me. In year 7, due to having acted not myself for so long, I didn't know who I was anymore. But I couldn't go back to acting as someone I wasn't, cause clearly that wasn't the solution either. My parents throughout all those years kept trying to encourage me to do what I wanted, be who I wanted, but due to trauma, until year 7, they were unsuccessful. But I was so broken in year 7 I was willing to listen to them. I got some counselling, started participating in school life again, and by the time I got to year 12, I was well respected again. But this time, I was respected by my classmates for who I was, not who I was pretending to be. I was respected for my 2 special interests: the environment and science behind how it all works, as well as my love for technology and how we can use it to enhance narratives. I was the environment captain in my year as well as getting opportunities to learn about how to use my auditory sensitivities combined with technological narrative knowledge for theatre and short films. And whenever I succeeded, many people, some my close friends and some acquaintances in my year level, would celebrate with me. But through it all, my parents supported me and provided the tools at home, and when needed, supported the school in providing me extra help, that enabled me to succeed. When supported properly, people with autism can flourish and succeed in ways that others can't.", "U sound awesome. I wish I had u as a kid!\n\nI wasn't diagnosed but my friends definitely acted like big sisters with me. They came to pick me up so we could walk to school and helped my mom get me dressed when I got distracted (ASD and ADHD fun combo)... I also got migraines and they were protective. And they would even rush my hair when it got tangled or help with make up and shopping as we got older. It wasn't perfect but I know they just knew I was different and very childlike.\n\nThe down side was they thought less of me. Left me with big confidence issues. So diagnosis and normalizing the words is important.", "Don't give him too much rope. I was very stubborn to put it mildly. Buy my mom was my mom, so when I said no to braces she should have made me get them. She tries to justify it with my stubbornness but I was a kid! And a big part of the horrible trajectory if my life is my trauma regarding my teeth. My mom should have known that was a moment I was too young to know better and step up.", "An 11 yo shouldn't be completely in charge of the decision making process. They're 11", "For me the label (a different label than autism) helps a lot. It helps with communication, expectations, known and expected behavior traits and much more like treatment and how life is better structured to reduce symptoms and impact.\n\nIt makes sense to have labels, because while we are not our disorder, our disorder is a part of us and at the  very least controls part of our lives one way or another.", "You can straighten teeth as long as you have teeth. Go get them  fixed.", "Yep. Labels help you get the support you need and are entitled to. It means you're more able to access the legally required(? in some cases) reasonable adjustments and adaptations you need. \n\nOn one of the autism subs, someone shared a comment about how getting a diagnosis means you know you're actually a zebra, rather than just thinking you're a weird horse. \n\nLabels can be good when they help you definitively know for yourself, and be able to tell others, who you are. Sometimes a label just helps you know, \"oh, I'm *this* and that's okay, and there are other people like me too\", rather than worrying you're some kind of freak.", "Same.", "I made one offhand comment about how I found one statement out of a post on the internet suspicious and for some reason that's what everyone wants to get worked up about. \n\nAt no point have I *assumed* anything here. I have actively avoided making assumptions. And I'm just about out of energy to explain anything else to a bunch of dumb fucks on the internet. You want to hate me over your own illiteracy, go for it. I'm done here.", "It was free when I was a kid. I'm 40 and on disability. I ain't getting braces anymore. And i've been told i would need multiple tooth removals and that it might not work, which scared me when I tried to get braces as a teen.\n\nMy teeth are already a mess now because my hatred of them fueled my neglect of them.\n\nI just... if I could do it all over I would get braces and not feel so self conscious about my mouth. What I'm saying is needed a parent to actually parent then and there. Just a cautionary tale. I know I messed up too.", "I love that! \ud83e\udd93"]}
