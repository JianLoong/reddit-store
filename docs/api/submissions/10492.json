I've taken her to consultations with autism specialists and everyone said her son wasn't autistic, but she keeps telling people he is to justify his bad behavior. \n\nLast week was my niece's birthday (my brother's daughter) and everyone in the family was there. My sister's son started throwing a tantrum when he saw that the cake wasn't for him. He started screaming, crying and trying to destroy the cake. Fortunately my brother stopped him in time, but when he caught him, my sister came running saying that he couldn't use physical force against a child, because \"he is an autistic child\". I just couldn't bear to hear that, I was already off limits. I yelled at my sister and told her her son is not autistic but a spoiled brat with no boundaries and poorly raised. She looked at me in shock and many family members looked the same. \n\nShe left with her son without waiting for the cake and then sent me dozens of messages saying that I was an asshole, prejudiced against autistic people and that she expected an apology.
