{"id": 16182, "submission_id": "1353la6", "title": "AITA for refusing to financially support my daughter's boyfriend?", "selftext": "I (F 48) have a daughter (F 18) who wants to go to art school. Her dream school is four hours from where we live in the capital of our state. Rent prices are out of this world expensive there, and we thought for a long time that she wouldn't be able to go to this school, until my sister offered her to stay at their house in the city rent free. She has accepted the offer and will be attending school at the end of May. Me and my husband very excited for her.\n\nBefore this offer came, however, she had a backup plan involving her boyfriend (M 22). Some background information: She met this guy through the Target she works at. At 21 years old, he does not have a driver's license (me and my husband had to help him learn how to drive and get his learner's permit), a high school diploma, a GED, or even sufficient savings built up. No one in our family has ever been fond of him. He is crass, rude, immature, and unmotivated. Every time he is over at our house, he is all over my daughter. He does not understand consequences. The only thing he had going for him was that he had a job. Well, not anymore. He was fired from Target. Her original plan was to move with him to the city of the school she wanted to attend, until she realized how impossible that would be with rent prices being what they are. That was a nasty wake up call for her. So, her backup plan was to move with him to the city two hours from ours, with another art school she could attend. This way, her boyfriend could stay with her and work full-time to provide for them both while she was in school full time. When we discussed this plan, I told her I would not help her pay for her car insurance or her phone bill if she chose to go to her second choice school just so he could live with her. She was very upset with me, and brought up how I'm paying for these things for her older brother. I responded that her brother is in school full time pursuing his bachelor's degree, without living a partner we would have to support. She has now confided in this brother and he has informed me that she is accusing me of \"financially manipulating\" her, because I did not want to help support her boyfriend while she went to school. Let me reiterate, she was going to settle for another school so her boyfriend could live with her, instead of going to her dream school - I would also like to mention that the program she is looking at is only six months long. She will be separated from her boyfriend for six months this way.\n\nSo, I guess I'm wondering - AITA by financially manipulating her? Or am I just setting a boundary that I would not help her make a huge mistake and settle for less than what she wants? If anyone has any questions or needs more information, I'd be happy to provide answers.\n\nEDIT: CLARIFICATIONS\n\n- First, she HAS accepted my sister\u2019s offer and will be attending her dream school! This is just an issue she has decided to revisit, for a reason I can\u2019t fully understand at the time. \n- Second, someone asked about his parents. He still lives with them, and they are partly responsible for how he\u2019s turned out and why he is so far behind in life. They are very hard on him and treat him pretty poorly.", "created_utc": 1682980661, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1353la6/aita_for_refusing_to_financially_support_my/", "score": 213, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I guarantee you that she will end up quitting shortly after she starts school and will not even tell you because she won't want you to know that she had to get a job and support him.  I'm speaking from experience here: Do not tell her to leave him or try to convince her in any way to go to the other school.  You must let her make her own choice.  The only thing you can do is exactly what you are doing.  Set the boundaries of what you will and won't do and stick to them.", "NTA.. A short term romance is leading her away from her dream school.

Period. \n\nHelping children pay for higher education is a gift, not a right. And it doesn't have to be equal. \n\nWe paid the most for our very high achieving child to go to a 4-yr state college immediately out of high school. On top of being very high achieving, he also had perfect behavior at school and age-appropriate life skills. Unfortunately, he was a little immature otherwise and would intentionally pick fights with his brothers and us. Moving him off to school made it easier for us to manage the younger children. For our second child, while he had decent grades and good behavior, he had atrocious life skills. Almost zero common sense. So we said we'd pay for Junior and Senior years if he stayed home and went to the local community college for the first two years. That worked well enough. He was still a little behind in life skills and we spent more time walking him through every step of managing finances, his car, even registering for classes and graduation. But he too graduated, yay. Last child has hated almost every aspect of academics. We paid for failing community college classes for two semesters, then we paid for a tech program he dropped out of, and now we've flipped the script and will only reimburse for classes/programs if he passes them. \n\nYou are not manipulating her. You are saying what you are willing to pay for and she gets to choose whether or not she wants to accept under those terms. The housing situation with the boyfriend 2 hours away depended on him being gainfully employed and reliable, as well as a relationship between two very young adults being able to survive living together. It would have been quite risky to pin limited tuition dollars to that situation. \n\nQuite frankly, you were generous in even allowing this 21 yr old guy in your house with your then 17 yr old daughter. \n\nYou did her a favor.

Take her on day/weekend trips to the college town, look up in advance good cafe spots and if the libraries are open and show her around. Take her shopping for a start of school Summer outfit.

I unfortunately had a baby with him. When I got pregnant I warned him that if he didn\u2019t help with the baby his ass was out. He didn\u2019t help. I kicked him out after a month. He got another woman pregnant and had his second daughter exactly to the day 1 year after my daughter but he claimed 2 years after the second child that he didn\u2019t remember his oldest child\u2019s birth date. Then when she was 17, he convinced her to go live with him. Then 6 months later kicked her out when she refused to be his live-in babysitter and house keeper. He did have his drivers license but he went through jobs like most people change their underwear. Show your daughter this because her boyfriend sounds a hell of a lot like my oldest sperm donor. This is one of those tough love decisions. My mother kicked my worthless boyfriend to the curb. I was pissed at 19.  26 years later I more than understand. And in truth, by the time I kicked his ass out of my apartment (5 months after my mom kicked him out of my stepdad\u2019s house) I completely understood. I just unfortunately never told her. Your daughter is looking at the same shit I went through. Hopefully she will take others advice and get rid of him. You absolutely needed to do this. And she won\u2019t use that money for her, she would give it to him because he will miraculously always have a reason he needs it more IF he were to actually get a job.

I'm so proud of the work you put in to get there, and I'll be really disappointed if you change your plans because of this guy.\" Attacking someone's relationship just makes them cling harder, especially at that age.

Those two had plans for living together and she was probably really excited about it. That first time you and a partner move in together when you\u2019re young has a really magical feeling about it. As incredibly generous as your sister\u2019s offer is (and it really is) - your daughter is 18 and the choice as she sees it is \u201cGo to school A.

Yes, it\u2019s your money, and you reasons for doing it are in her best interest, but yeah, you are threatening to withhold money that was previously offered on account of reasons they haven\u2019t actually happened, to force her into making a choice you prefer.\n\nIf your offer was to pay for her phone and car insurance, and that\u2019s the only amount you are giving her, and those bills get paid, then you aren\u2019t paying to support her boyfriend. You\u2019re supporting your daughter, the same way you\u2019re supporting your son. \n\nLike I said, there are NAH. Your daughter is in love and eager to start her \u201cgrown up life\u201d. She\u2019s lucky to have a supportive family and you\u2019re free to want to have boundaries.

But you\u2019re absolutely right, she can\u2019t see that future. \n\nI, along with everyone in the family, are trying our best not to feed into the Romeo and Juliet dynamics, haha.
