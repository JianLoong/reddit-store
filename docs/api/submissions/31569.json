He started calling me paranoid and he didn't think she would take our daughter out of school. This maybe where I stepped over the line I brought up his childhood and shouted at him that I didn't want someone like her around our child.

As a child of abusive parents, it can be hard not to have a soft spot for them or to long for their approval into adulthood whenever there's a glimmer of hope. Which is what I'm assuming your husband is experiencing right now. Trying to forget all his hurt and believe that his mother has changed and has now come back to love him properly. I don't think anyone really ever gets over the abandonment and rejection of their biological parents.\nI would say try to give your husband some grace during this time as she is likely to hurt and disappoint him again.\nBut remain firm on your protection of your child.\nMaybe you can show him that you are willing to be flexible and positive perhaps by saying that once she's settled back into his life individually then he can move onto meeting the rest of the family. Or that she may meet your child but in a public setting with yourself or someone you trust chaperoning.", "NTA for what you did at the school. Even if both of you were to decide eventually that she can meet the child, that's no reason to give permission for her to pick her up from school. You want that first meeting to be with both of you present, in a situation of your choosing, not surprising your child at school. You did the right thing by your daughter, who has to be your priority.  \n\n\nIt wasn't ideal to yell at him, but I think it's understandable because you were trying to convey a potential risk to your child that he had not understood from your earlier conversation about it. If HE wants to give her a chance then it's up to him what relationship HE has with his mother, but he doesn't get to unilaterally decide for your daughter. I'd definitely be seeing how his relationship with her goes over a long period of time before ever meeting your daughter. It's up to her to build up trust again and demonstrate that she's changed and can be a positive person in your lives.", "Follow that instinct. NTA. But could be if you allow him to introduce this abusive person to your daughter before they\u2019ve done any healing at all. They need to sort their shit without your little girl involved at all. Then maybe you can revisit the issue.", "NTA he can give her a chance if he wants but you have to protect your kid from an abuser. As you said SM is grandma that\u2019s how it should stay.", "NTA for protecting a child.\n\nI'm just surprised about the **\"no-go list\"** in your country.\n\nWhere I live they have a **\"to-go list\"**. Only people ON the list have access to the child. And even so, if it's not one of the regular persons picking up the child, school STILL needs to be informed about the change of plans, BEFORE the non-regular person of the \"to-go list\" gets to pick up the child.", "Nta", "NTA! If a person was so horrible and abusive to your husband, it's only fair that you did what you did to protect your child.", "NTA", "I think you're NTA and you should always put your child's safety first. He can reconnect with her alone and see how it goes. There is no reason for her to meet your child right away, if ever. \n\nI also think that in this situation, the type of abuse makes a difference. Was she a neglectful addict who has been clean for decades now? Did she physically or sexually assault him? You don't have to answer those questions, but abuse is a very broad term that encompasses everything from mild emotional invalidation to physical assault. There are some forms of abuse that mean that person will be forever dangerous to others. If she was severely abusive towards him, I wouldn't want to ever give her the chance to connect with my child. Whereas if she was neglectful due to immaturity or a past addiction, I might consider a public meeting in the future to see how it goes.", "NTA does your husband have any concern over his daughters safety? I understand he's probably under some delusion of white picket fences but that's no reason to put the family at risk. If she wants to meet her granddaughter she will put in the leg work to prove she's changed and she's back in her son life for good. And yes, don't confuse the kid, her grandma is grandma period of discussion doesn't matter if she's step. Also I would let your husband know what child endangerment and kidnapping are and you'll be willing to press charges to keep your baby safe.", "I am assuming you only have second hand information from your partner or perhaps other family members. I\u2019m not exactly sure why that prompted you to alert the school. Does she have a history of kidnapping kids?\n\nYour partner is an adult so you don\u2019t have control of them. You do have say in who you allow in your child\u2019s life. I\u2019m not sure how you are going to be able to figure out if she\u2019s changed if you don\u2019t meet with her.\n\nSince your partner wants to meet with her I think you\u2019re going to need a better plan than just saying no. Your partner did not create this problem so I\u2019m not understanding why you\u2019re yelling at him. He was a child when this stuff happened & he is choosing to meet with this woman. He can meet with his Mom without you or kid.\n\nNAH", "NTA but I think it needs more details.\n\nIs there any court order?", "If he wants to give her a chance to connect with HIM that\u2019s up to him. You and your child have nothing to do with that. You don\u2019t have to be in contact with anyone you have no desire for you and your child to meet, and no one, spouse or not, gets to decide that for you.", "YTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor going behind your partner's back.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

As a parent you're supposed to protect kids from anyone who would hurt them, especially family.\n\nYour husband calling you paranoid because you don't want your child around someone who has a history of certain behaviours is not okay.\n\nYou aren't saying your husband can't give his mother a chance. You just don't want to expose your daughter to her knowing she was negligent to your husband.", "I think this is a point I will never fully understand and I grew up with both my parents and never been abused or neglected by them so I don't think I'll understand why my husband wants a relationship with her.

And at my kids' school if you have something pop up last minute so call to let them know your kid will be picked up by someone else the school calls you back to confirm, to double check it was actually you calling.\n\nI was wondering how a no go list would even work. Anyone can just go unless they are on there?", "I got the full story off his grandparents and him and seen the reports. His grandma showed them to me just before we got married so I had all the information before we invited her to the wedding. I'm not stopping my husband seeing her at all but I just won't have her meet our daughter. And no history of kidnapping just physical abuse and neglect. I know he wasn't at all to blame he was a baby. She might have changed but why now is the ultimate question why not when he was a kid that wanted to have a mum. So no I won't meet up with her. Thank you for the insight.", "No court order she's only just got back in touch with him after nearly a decade and before that she abandoned him with his grandparents so she's not really had a relationship with him I think that's why he wants to give her a chance.", "Husband is not letting her back in because he's a good person. He's letting her back in bc he's a damaged person who likely still has a lot of unresolved issues. Does he have a therapist?\n\nThere's no reason to yell about things, but there is every reason to be firm about it.\n\n\"Husband, we need to go slow. We don't know whether you and her can rebuild a relationship, and until you are in a stable place with your mother it's premature to introduce her to our child.\n\n\"What if we introduce her but then we discover your Mom cannot be trusted around Child? We'll disturb our child's life for no good reason. We need to build trust first.\n\n\"Husband, if it's meant to be, both you and her should have no problem with delaying that introduction. And frankly, if she demands to see the kid right away, she does not have Child's best interests in mind, and that's a very bad sign.\"", "I get that. Its completely nonsensical really and he will likely realise that himself and be embarrassed once she let's him down again. \nBut it's something he will probably always feel. Your parents are 'meant' to be the two people who will love you most and unconditionally in this world no matter what. And when you don't have that growing up, no matter how much it defies logic, you will always crave that parental love and acceptance and there will always be a part of yourself that feels unworthy and insecure because your parents threw you away.", "Here's the thing about abusers, they can wear a mask for a short time, some can wear a mask for years, but they rarely ever change. It's her long-term consistent and reliable demonstration of betterment in character that you need to see before she has contact with your child, and you need your husband's wholehearted agreement on that.\n\nYour  husband is dealing with decades of abuse and trauma related to that abuse, he's not a good judge of her \"new leaf\" so a few months of her acting nicey-nice doesn't cut it. However long and intensely the need to review her character before deciding to will allow her contact with your child is up to you, not your husband.\n\nAnd even if you do allow her into your child's life, one slip of that mask you pull right back out, because even if it seems like a small incident, it's too dangerous a risk to overlook. Your husband's emotional want to reconcile his childhood and reconnect with his mother does not take precedence over protecting your child.", "Unfortunately, having children doesn\u2019t automatically make people good parents. I hope everything works out for your husband. I\u2019m sure he has a lot of questions. Hopefully, he gets some answers & insight that can help him with some closure.\n\nIt\u2019s definitely not going to be an easy or simple situation.
