She says that she can just look up the same strategies her therapist is giving her and her crying once a week isn't actually all that much. I've humored her a few times but it's getting to the point that she's resisting her treatment and will refuse to get in the car to appointments. Finally I got tired of her whining and told her that I know better than her and she's going to be seeing this therapist whether she likes it or not.\n\nThat's what I think may have made me the asshole, because I was kind of abrasive. My daughter's been vaguely annoyed at me since I said that, but at least she's been going to her appointments now.

Why are you depressed?\" Along with other things that gave me trauma from therapy, and this was my mom forcing me to go. It took many years to get trust back in my mom from this time.

Tell her the reasons you are concerned from YOUR perspective (aka don\u2019t put blame on her). Give her some options. For example: \u201cI am concerned as I have heard you crying a lot lately. Therapy can be a safe space for you to talk about emotions and life events you are going through. I would not know what you say during therapy, and therapy does not mean that you have anything wrong with you.

I know you said she's crying once a week but on it's own that doesn't feel like anything, and you said you initially sent her to therapy just because you were advised it was generally good for everyone to do.

It seems like a lot of people think therapy is some magical cure-all. I\u2019m not saying it can\u2019t be helpful, but a lot of people can figure out for themselves how to sort out their lives. And, in my experience at least, there are a lot of awful mental health professionals out there.", "I cry when I\u2019m mad too and it\u2019s the most annoying thing in the world. I actually don\u2019t cry a lot when I\u2019m sad, a few tears but that\u2019s it. Angry? Sobbing mess. It\u2019s awful. And really hit when I was in high school.", "I think I heard on a podcast that it has something to do with your tear ducts being an outlet for the rage hormones, especially if you have a more estrogen based physiology", "I angry cry too.  I think it was because girls weren't allowed to show anger and I wasn't taught healthy ways how to handle it as a child.", "When I was a teen I outright sobbed to \"they paved paradise and turned it into a parking lot\" and was absolutely gutted about how many paradises were turned into lots over the years. I listened to it again as an adult and was like \"yeah it's sad but not sob on the floor sad\"", "the first time I saw that commercial it was 5:30 am and I burst into tears. Just thinking about it I get misty. And I'm almost 50.", "lmao thank you this thread was making me feel crazy. I cried today because mountains exist.", "Thank you. I can imagine the WAY OPs daughter is crying is probably really concerning to OP but dang...I can cry, CRYYY, *fucking* cry, and then just be cryinnnnng. And then there's sobbing and then weeping...idk. maybe I'm an emotional person and nobody really *wants* to cry but gd...\n\nIf the mom seriously thinks the ONLY reason her daughter needs to be in therapy is because she's crying every week then I'd love to know how disconnected OP seriously is.", "Yeah, so bad that my daughter feels so much better about herself and is a pretty happy functioning adult now", "Doesn\u2019t that violate some kind of oath, or at least considered to be a big no-no?", "That is an excellent reason to dump a therapist", ">it would also give her a chance to feel like she has some influence in what's going on. Might make her more likely to cooperate. I know when I was at her age and I wasn't given an option I'd be uncooperative out of sheer spite.", "If you trust your BIL saying that everyone should be in therapy, why aren\u2019t you in therapy? Don\u2019t you trust that he knows you better than you know yourself? \n\nThe answer is that of course you don\u2019t think he knows you better than you know yourself, you know whether you want therapy or not. Trust your daughter to know herself too. By forcing her to go when she doesn\u2019t want to, you\u2019re just turning her off to therapy so she won\u2019t be willing to go ever, and you\u2019re alienating her.", "I\u2019m not a therapist, and I say everybody (in the US) needs therapy because we do.", "Also, I fully believe saying everyone needs therapy, seriously minimizes the seriousness of true trauma or diagnosed mental health conditions. Feeling anxious and uncomfortable is a normal part of life. Therapy is not required to get thru daily life. There are people with real problems.", "Angry crying is the worst, there\u2019s nothing like being legitimately pissed off and crying instead of looking fierce or something.", "Ooof. That song got me good once. And \u201ccup of coffee\u201d by Garbage. Like the ugliest of tears and I hadn\u2019t even lived enough life to understand that hurt yet.", "\ud83e\udd23 I'm sorry but this is definitely something that would make me cry. I want to cry because my cats toes are so fucking cute \ud83d\ude2d", "Sure, but it still happens.\n\nThe point is tho' thatbit will be pretty hard to convince a 15 yr old that the therapist can be trusted whether they actually give out info or not. At that age, there is bo way I'd be comfortable going to a therapist who was friends w/ my uncle.", "In hindsight there were a lot of red flags. She started hugging me when I came in for sessions; I felt uncomfortable and politely asked her to stop. She would interrupt me if I was talking about something in detail and I\u2019d forget where I was after she was done. And on the same day she said something homophobic, she also recommended I date a girl we both know (she was Indian like me so even though we hadn\u2019t crossed paths before we had mutual friends) who was about 16/17 when I was 21. Really glad I got out of that lol. It was one of my first therapist experiences so I didn\u2019t know a lot of those things were bad until the red flags became fucking flashing neon red lights.", "Kid's therapist is described as someone he knew from grad school.  That's hardly a friend of the family.", "CHRISTMAS SHOES. but to be fair that one gets me a whole ass adult. But cup of coffee is a hilarious one to ugly cry over. Teenage hood hey?", "Oh god, that sounds completely awful. Did you find a better therapist?", "There is a conflict of interest for medical professionals (including therapists) to treat people they know.", "Oddly I think she helped enough that I didn\u2019t end up in dire need for a therapist after her. As I\u2019m struggling financially (was in college at the time, now in first jobs) I\u2019d rather save the money for a bit. However I\u2019m contemplating a career change to something more lucrative and I think I\u2019ll get another therapist once I\u2019m successful in doing that.", "OP doesn\u2019t know this person, they were recommended to her by someone she knows."]}
