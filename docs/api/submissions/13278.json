She says that she can just look up the same strategies her therapist is giving her and her crying once a week isn't actually all that much. I've humored her a few times but it's getting to the point that she's resisting her treatment and will refuse to get in the car to appointments. Finally I got tired of her whining and told her that I know better than her and she's going to be seeing this therapist whether she likes it or not.\n\nThat's what I think may have made me the asshole, because I was kind of abrasive.

Why are you depressed?\" Along with other things that gave me trauma from therapy, and this was my mom forcing me to go. It took many years to get trust back in my mom from this time.

Tell her the reasons you are concerned from YOUR perspective (aka don\u2019t put blame on her). Give her some options. For example: \u201cI am concerned as I have heard you crying a lot lately. Therapy can be a safe space for you to talk about emotions and life events you are going through. I would not know what you say during therapy, and therapy does not mean that you have anything wrong with you.

She asked me if I wanted to go, and I refused. That decision should not have been mine to make, and serves as an example of the parentification and neglect I endured at her hands. OP, I think you could stand to take a gentler and more understanding approach if you believe your daughter needs this. Give her as much agency as you can while remaining firm that she attend \u2014 let her try different therapists, let her decide whether or not to share her work with you.", "YTA for forcing therapy with a therapist she doesn\u2019t like.\n\nINFO: have you actually talked to her about being upset or was this just \u2018oh she\u2019s crying too much, she must need therapy\u2019", "YTA. You\u2019ve stated you don\u2019t want medical advice, but the way you\u2019ve written about this shows you have a poor understanding of mental health and treatment for it.\n\nYou should listen to your daughter, start from scratch and have her talk to her pediatrician, and if it is recommended have them refer a psychologist.  \n\nSticking to your guns and making her see a therapist of a family member\u2019s recommendation is more problematic than you realize. Your daughter is also old enough to understand if her therapy is benefiting her than you give her credit.", "She doesn't like her but I think she can learn to like her when she actually commits to working in her sessions.", "NTA,\n\nMost teenagers do not want to go to therapy. \n\n>You should wait for her to be ready instead of trying to force her to go because she...cries?\n\nThat's a silly thing to say. Not experiencing therapy is not going to make the daughter magically want therapy. \n\nAlso, I suspect she cries, but she didn't tell her parents why she cried. For all the OP knew, she could have been bullied at school, or there could have been a medical issue. Hiring a therapist sounds like it was the right call.", "1. My BIL told me she should see a therapist. He says that everybody needs therapy and it should be normalized. \n2. The therapist told her and me that she has anxiety \n3. I have not used the word \"fix\" with her directly.", "I don't know if it rises to the level of AH, but this is absolutely right. Therapy won't do sh\\*t unless the patient wants to change. If she says crying once a week isn't all that much, I'm inclined to be on her side.  Crying isn't unhealthy, and being sad isn't necessarily unhealthy, either. If she feels overwhelmed or depressed or anxious, then yeah therapy is a really good idea, but only if she's willing to listen, implement the strategies the therapist suggests, and work on herself.", "Is it normal to cry weekly? Not judging, I\u2019m genuinely curious because that feels unhealthy to me but maybe I\u2019m out of touch.", "It's important to me because my BIL knows this person and knows that she does good work.\n\nThe therapist herself has said that it's anxiety. I didn't just make that part up for fun.", "Thanks for your story.  I'm not going to go into too many details but that hit *hard* for me.  It's hard when you're a parent to know what the right thing to do is when it comes to your children when your instincts are screaming to help them however you can.  I've questioned if I've done the right thing in a very similar situation before (I went a different route than your mother) and your story really got to me.  What happened to you was exactly what I did my best to avoid, and I hope that I succeeded.", "So honestly, what is a parent supposed to do then?  Just ignore their child\u2019s clear mental health struggles?  You say forcing therapy is terrible for mental health, but if someone\u2019s mental health is already terrible what is the solution?", "I forced my daughter into both individual and family therapy. I think things would have been much worse if I hadn't. Our relationship improved, she became much better at expressing her feelings and though therapy she became open to trying an antidepressant which has been very helpful", "She started off with just not liking this one. Now she's gotten cynical and she won't consider any.", "Why is it the right decision?  She's a hormonal 15yo.  Puberty is tough, hormones make things tough.  Crying a few times a month is not abnormal.", "There\u2019s no use in telling a teenager that you know better than them though. They won\u2019t listen to that. Teenagers can be reasoned with, but that\u2019s not the way to do it", "I'd like to add we don't know how her daughter feels about therapy in general.  If it's a negative attitude, then I think therapy needs to be reframed.  i.e. it's not for crazy people it's so you can be more self-aware or learn how to tackle problems in your life.", "If she doesn't like the therapist or feel comfortable with them, it's not the right therapist.", "Then find her a different therapist. She needs to like them and be comfortable or she isn\u2019t getting anything out of it", "No. Your daughter should feel safe in therapy sessions. I have friends who have been in therapy for years and it took them multiple therapists to find one they like. I fired my therapist once myself because she made me feel very uncomfortable and i didn't connect with her after a number of sessions. The first one isn't always the one and therapy is not a magic bullet. \n\nMaybe you should be in therapy too since you seem to lack empathy and listening to your daughter.", "Nope. Not how therapists work. You need to find the right one for you. Having to learn to work around a therapist just lengthens the amount of time until you can start to heal", "How many sessions has she had? Maybe compromise with her and ask her to commit to a certain number of sessions, and be willing to find a new therapist if she really doesn't want to see this one. Ask your brother as well. What does he think about forcing a client to see him or someone in his profession? I'm leaning toward he probably would encourage the person to see someone else.", "I\u2019ve changed therapists before. A bad fit won\u2019t help your daughter.", "Well, just found out why therapy isn't working.", "No. You are making a huge mistake and giving her an aversion to seeking professional help. Your daughters feelings on this still matter. You do not know better. If you were going to therapy and were not connecting with your therapist...would you not just go find someone else?", "I think I\u2019ve had maybe 7 therapists in my life so far\u2026I\u2019m 25. I jumped ship a few times because they did things I didn\u2019t like. \n\nOne insisted my depression will go away if I exercise - every session was about exercise. I jumped ship. \n\nOne I jumped ship because she forced homework on me that I didn\u2019t like/was pointless. Another had homework too (let me tell you that when I actively sought out worksheets, etc. on my own time, they were more helpful than the therapists\u2019). \n\nOne downplayed my abuse and c-ptsd. Said \u201cit\u2019s not like you were SA or physically.\u201d I jumped ship.\n\nOne therapist told me that I needed more care than he could provide. Therapy was about 5-10 min with him in which he checked to make sure I hadn\u2019t unalived myself and wasn\u2019t SH too badly and sent me on my way each session. I jumped ship.\n\nThe list goes on. What I\u2019m trying to say is that sometimes their way of therapy isn\u2019t meshing with you. Perhaps the personality. Perhaps they\u2019re just an AH. Find someone for your daughter that she likes and she WILL eventually get better. Force her to see someone she doesn\u2019t like and she isn\u2019t going anywhere.", "So, are you in therapy? How's it going? Would you change therapists if you didn't like the one you first saw, or would you keep going indefinitely to the same person regardless?", "Is she okay with her therapist telling you things? I know I wouldn\u2019t be. Find her a therapist she actually connects with and don\u2019t press for information from either of them. That can damage their working relationship.", "Your BIL shouldn't be recommending anything regarding your kid's health. That's an ethics violation.", "No. Everyone does NOT need therapy.  You are searching for problems.", "For a hormonal teenaged girl? It could be. I used to cry every time the ASPCA commercials would come on. \n\nStill do, if we\u2019re at the right part of the month. \n\n*in the arms of an annngeeellll\u2026.*", "Crying is my natural anger response. No idea why, but unadulterated rage makes me sob. As a teenage girl, I was angry a lot. Could be that. Or it could be normal teenage hormone fluctuations. Or it could legit be a mental health thing that OP is going about trying to fix in the wrong way.", ">It's important to me because my BIL knows this person and knows that she does good work.\n\nI would feel very uncomfortable with my child's therapist being connected to the family", "So you're communicating directly with the therapist, rather than allowing your daughter to maintain her privacy. Her awareness that this person who was hand-picked is disclosing information about her sessions is very likely to contribute to her desire to stop talking to them. And if she ISN'T aware that details are being disclosed or has been misled about that, that's also pretty unsavory.\n\nAnd the last bit? Your perspective on what therapy is/does?", "Thank you! I became a mom too and realized why she did what she did, and we've been able to move and cope through it. There's still things that happened..  That we're working on and eventually I did find a therapist myself as an adult. It works itself out in the end with some luck and perseverance!", "They're supposed to find a therapist their child is comfortable with. It doesn't take a rocket scientist to realize that she doesn't like the therapist.", "Thank you! That is my same question", "I\u2019ve had a therapist that I didn\u2019t click with before. Maybe if she keeps this up you should try another therapist. \n\nI\u2019m voting NTA. I think that your insistence is called for.", "This is very true! I have had to do this exact thing with my daughter and made her realize that therapy is just a tool to help her, nothing is wrong with her, it\u2019s just something that millions of people use to make their lives better. \n\nReading more of OPs comments though, it sounds like she is unlikely to do that, she doesn\u2019t care that her daughter doesn\u2019t like and isn\u2019t connecting with her therapist.", "Good point, and might be the perfect compromise. INFO\u2014 OP, what if she wants to change therapists?", "Getting a therapist that is a friend of the family isn't going to help either. The family should have no connection to the therapist.", "This is important. \n\nIf she\u2019s seen the therapist once or twice and is guarded, it will take more sessions for her to figure out whether she likes the sessions. \n\nI have bounced around therapists enough to know the whole opening spiel that gobbles up the first session. If I don\u2019t get anything out of it by the second one, it\u2019s bye bye. But I\u2019m in my 40s.  \n\nThis is a teenager who probably just thinks, I am forced to be here. I don\u2019t want to talk. They can\u2019t make me speak. \n\nIf it\u2019s not working with this person, time to search around and find another one and try again.", "I would continue, because good things come to those who wait. Patience is a virtue.", "Anything the therapist has told me my daughter has given her permission to tell.", "Only a therapist would say \u201ceverybody needs therapy\u201d. Does your daughter tell you why she\u2019s crying? Is she being bullied, struggling socially, stressed from school? Is there something that can be done to provide relief? I also agree with others who say if you\u2019re going to force her into therapy, it will only be effective with someone she feels comfortable with not someone your BIL is comfortable with.", "There's a code of ethics for being a brother in law?", "How is that an ethics violation?", "it actually isn't", "That has an obvious source though. Also did you legit cry or just get teary eyed?", "I have never used the term \"fixed\" with my daughter. I just figured it would be quicker to use it when writing out this post than \"An individual process designed to help her develop coping strategies or identify stressors.\"\n\nAnd the therapist did ask my daughter permission to share the anxiety diagnosis. This was not some backhanded thing.", "That\u2019s still forcing your child to go to therapy so it doesn\u2019t really answer my question.  And yes, if OPs daughter isn\u2019t able to work with the first therapist then trying another would make sense, but also I\u2019m guessing a lot of teens would say \u201cI don\u2019t like this therapist\u201d when really that\u2019s an excuse because they just don\u2019t want to go to therapy.  It\u2019s still worth trying another therapist though.", "The solution, that I had wished my mom back then had done, was to make a middle ground. Something along the lines of, \"I just want to get you help, so how can we fix this?\" Yes, therapy is important if it's needed. How OP described it is \"Crying and anxiety\" which, 15f hormones are out of control. At some point just letting it ride is a wise decision and if it's not improving with her own ways then go back to therapy. If she doesn't like this therapist, change to a new one, if it's the fact that face to face isn't working there are text services that can help. It took me as an adult several attempts to find a therapist that matched who I was.", "She used to want to but she doesn't anymore. She'd rather just quit therapy.", "you /would/ continue, which means you're not in therapy?\n\nand listen, liking a therapist isn't something you can \"patience\" your way into. it's very, very normal to try out three or four therapists (none of whom should be family friends by the way), which is why a lot of insurance plans waive the copay for the first few therapy sessions. there is an assumption it takes time to find the right fit, just like with any medical professional.\n\nwith peace and love, you sound like you don't actually care what's making your daughter upset. you sound like you want her to be normal. that's not what therapy is for.", "LOL that's not how it works.", "So, *are* you in therapy?", "but does she feel compelled to give permission?", "I literally had flashbacks to my first therapy sessions with her saying everyone should do therapy in their life. Same therapist got fired 5 weeks later because she wouldn't listen to what I was saying and couldn't keep an appointment but yet got mad when I couldn't answer my phone at work.", "There's a code of ethics when it comes to medical practice genius.", "He's a therapist recommending that a family member see a therapist he knows personally?", "Oh no, like ugly crying. I don\u2019t really cry when angry or sad or whatever unless something big happens. But movies and the random sad animal commercial? I\u2019m sobbing.", "The fact that you didn't use the word \"fixed\" in that particular series of conversations doesn't mean she's not aware that you think of it that way, though. She's old enough to connect dots and to have learned from your perspective; she probably ALSO thinks therapy is for fixing, and if you force her to go she must be broken.\n\nSo the therapist asked her permission. Given that she is there under duress, do you think she might have felt less than confident that her wishes would be respected if she said no, or that she might be pushed to give that information just as she was pushed to have sessions with a person she doesn't connect to?", "So you think forcing therapy is ok, you just don\u2019t like the way your mom did it / think she over reacted?", "While I realize you are trying to be helpful, you are clearly out of your depth and have shown it with the *\u201dcrying and anxiety\u201d, which, 15f hormones are out of control*.\n\nThis was the feedback **from a therapist**, not mom casting a wild guess. I highly suggest you stop trying to be the online professional and let actual professionals help people.", "Then I think letting her choose her therapist is crucial here, regardless of how highly recommended. Plus she might be reluctant because the therapist knows y\u2019all. When I have to take choices away from my daughter, I try to let her make secondary decisions, and she feels better because it\u2019s in her control so she\u2019s more amenable to the ideas after that.

It\u2019s pretty common.", "No forcing therapy is not ok. It causes more harm than good. In my case, I had a history of abuse where the therapists basically said, \"you have no reason to be this way.\" without getting to the root or past they were focusing on my mom just being a 'good mom' for even bringing me.

When I was teenager crisis didn't have my mom leave the room and I had to deal with her standing behind me with her arms crossed pretty much sighing(that's my 15-year-old brain remembering it that way in truth she was close to tears herself).\n\nWhat I'm for is finding the proper therapist or ways to get her therapy that will actually help and not leave lasting scars against all therapists. Anxiety makes it hard to open up in person, at least in my experience. So, since technology has improved text-based therapies can be a great option and makes it much easier to open up as you don't need to see the other person. Every human is different and deals with their own issues differently. Sometimes learning about your issues is enough to help yourself, while others are better at talking and opening up.
