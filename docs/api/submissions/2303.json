I told him to eat his lunch, and he said he already did. I hadn't seen him touch it yet, so I didn't believe him, because there's no way to eat a lunch in five seconds. I asked for the bag, and he said he threw it away.\n\nI went over to the trash, and the bag was on top. I took it out, and none of the food had been touched. I brought the bag back to him and said he missed a few things. He wouldn't take it and said \"it's from the trash!\" I said none of the food touched the trash. The bag and individual food containers both kept the food clean, and the bag had just been on top of the trash anyway, not really in it.\n\nHe started to cry and say he didn't want food from the trash. I asked why he put it in the trash then, and he said because it was yucky. I packed foods I know he likes, so I knew this was just about McDonald's. I put the bag back with our stuff and said it was there when he changed his mind. He complained the rest of the day that he was hungry, and I kept telling him to go eat his lunch. He started sobbing at one point about how hungry he was, and I offered him some of my daughter's food she didn't finish. He didn't want \"baby food.\"\n\nWhen we got back to my brother's house he was still crying about McDonald's (saw it again on the way home, unavoidable without adding ridiculous time to the trip and set him off wailing). He ran up to my SiL and screamed \"uncle OP made me eat food from the trash!\" She was confused, so I explained that he put his lunch bag in the trash, and I took it back out.\n\nMy SiL said that's disgusting. I explained that the food was protected by two layers, individual containers and the bag, but she said eating out of the trash is *never* okay. She asked me if I would eat food out of a restaurant dumpster. I felt like she didn't really understand what happened, and my nephew was still crying, so I decided to leave and talk about it later.\n\nWhen I talked my my brother he said it was \"okay\" that I got \"overwhelmed\" and made a \"bad judgement call\" and to give my SiL time to cool down.

No I do not expect you to give in to the demands of a 5 year old about McDonalds. But there was a better way to teach him a lesson which didn\u2019t require you making him eat food from the trash. Instead you should have just told him he was not getting another meal. If you thought the food was fine and you didn\u2019t want it to go to waste you can eat it at home yourself.
