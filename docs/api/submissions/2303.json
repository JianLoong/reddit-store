On the way there, he asked for McDonald's, and I said no. I'm on a budget right now, and I probably would have said no anyway, because I don't like wasting food. He argued, and I explained that I packed him a lunch a few times before finally telling him we're going to end the topic and putting on some Disney music for them.\n\nAt the park, I was distracted for a second and he came up to me and said he was hungry. I told him to eat his lunch, and he said he already did. I hadn't seen him touch it yet, so I didn't believe him, because there's no way to eat a lunch in five seconds. I asked for the bag, and he said he threw it away.\n\nI went over to the trash, and the bag was on top. I took it out, and none of the food had been touched. I brought the bag back to him and said he missed a few things. He wouldn't take it and said \"it's from the trash!\" I said none of the food touched the trash. The bag and individual food containers both kept the food clean, and the bag had just been on top of the trash anyway, not really in it.\n\nHe started to cry and say he didn't want food from the trash. I asked why he put it in the trash then, and he said because it was yucky. I packed foods I know he likes, so I knew this was just about McDonald's. I put the bag back with our stuff and said it was there when he changed his mind. He complained the rest of the day that he was hungry, and I kept telling him to go eat his lunch. He started sobbing at one point about how hungry he was, and I offered him some of my daughter's food she didn't finish. He didn't want \"baby food.\"\n\nWhen we got back to my brother's house he was still crying about McDonald's (saw it again on the way home, unavoidable without adding ridiculous time to the trip and set him off wailing). He ran up to my SiL and screamed \"uncle OP made me eat food from the trash!\" She was confused, so I explained that he put his lunch bag in the trash, and I took it back out.\n\nMy SiL said that's disgusting. I explained that the food was protected by two layers, individual containers and the bag, but she said eating out of the trash is *never* okay. She asked me if I would eat food out of a restaurant dumpster. I felt like she didn't really understand what happened, and my nephew was still crying, so I decided to leave and talk about it later.\n\nWhen I talked my my brother he said it was \"okay\" that I got \"overwhelmed\" and made a \"bad judgement call\" and to give my SiL time to cool down. I'm glad my brother isn't mad, but I really don't think I did anything wrong. My wife agrees with me, but she's my wife.

You should not have made him eat \"trash food\" no matter how protected it was from the actual trash. \n2. The kid is a brat. He does not understand the word \"no\".

Huge lapse on your part. You should have been sitting with them after giving them their lunches.", "ESH. I think the food was fine, and I don't think you should have gotten him McDonalds. But he's probably been told never to eat food that's in the trash, and kids that age are not good at grasping exceptions to rules. What would you have done if he'd thrown the food on the ground and it had been genuinely ruined? Taken him home, gotten a cheap snack that isn't the treat he was trying to manipulate his way into getting, run by your house to make another sandwich, ... ? I think you should have done whatever you would have done if the food were genuinely gone.", "NTA. You knew exactly what he was doing. Good for you for not giving in. Next time let SIL pack him $ for McDs if that's the issue. \n\nBut to be totally honest, I would be the cool uncle and plan to take him to McDs sometimes when you have him. It's just a couple of bucks and it's nice to have your nephew excited to see you.", "ESH except your daughter. \n\nYour nephew because he wasted food and although he\u2019s 5. This strikes me as a learned behavior. \n\nSIL and brother suck because I\u2019m assuming this is where he got this learned behavior from. \n\nYou suck because you handled this poorly. No I do not expect you to give in to the demands of a 5 year old about McDonalds. But there was a better way to teach him a lesson which didn\u2019t require you making him eat food from the trash. Instead you should have just told him he was not getting another meal. If you thought the food was fine and you didn\u2019t want it to go to waste you can eat it at home yourself. Once he started complaining about being hungry, you give him the option for you guys to go home. \u201cI guess we have to go home early for you to have something else to eat.\u201d Make it clear that the alternative to throwing his food away did not mean he would get what he wants, instead he loses out on something else: his time at the park. If you would have just taken him home once he started complaining about being hungry you would\u2019ve been in the clear.", "YTA, even if the food \"didn't touch\" the trash, it *being in a public trash can* would be waaaay too gross and unsanitary for a lot of people to be okay with it. So you shouldn't be making that call for someone else's child. And his parents also have a very good reason to not want to teach their kid that it's *sometimes* okay to eat food that's been in the trash, because that's a recipe for disaster.\n\nYour nephew was acting like a brat, but he is literally only 5 years old, and he didn't deserve to be made to eat food out the trash. Even if he was initially just being picky because he wanted McDonalds, him refusing to eat it after it had been in the trash might very well have been out of (reasonable) disgust. \n\nAt least it sounds like you didn't actually force him to eat it, and you did offer him food that had not been in a trash can. But this was a disgusting and unreasonable way to handle this behavior.", "ESH.  The \"trash lunch\" was barely that if it was sitting on top, in a bag, and in food containers. The lesson I might have taught him instead is about missing a meal when you fuss too much.\n\nBut you're not a great babysitter if \"At the park, I was distracted for a second\" which was long enough for a kid to take his lunch bag that he's supposed to be eating in front of you, and get it all the way to the garbage bin without you noticing.
