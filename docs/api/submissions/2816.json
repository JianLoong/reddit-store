She is needy and always tries too hard to get people to like her, and is always aiming for perfection in her life. My mother and I would love to be there for her when she needs us, but she \"needs\" us so often that we have no desire to offer any help. I don't like answering her calls because I know it's just another favor. Don't get me wrong, for the most part they're legitimate, but it still gets annoying. As an example this past week she asked me to babysit her kids because she forgot they had a half day and due to required school and work commitments neither she nor her husband could make it, the prior week she needed me to drive her kids and husband to school and work, before that one kid was sick and she asked me to watch him on my day off. The requests go on and on. She's always apologetic, she knows it's an inconvenience, but she does NOTHING to prevent the next event. If we say no we're given the 3rd degree. \"Why can't we help? What are we doing? Don't we understand how stressed she is right now? She whines about the fact that NOBODY ever offers to help her, she has to beg us for help. My mom and I end up helping out the most but it is just too much. \n\nSince the majority of the requests she makes are child related I want to get her a gift card for a babysitting/nanny service. The problem is that I am sure that she will take this as me not wanting to watch her kids (it's not, I love my nibblings I would just prefer scheduling time to be with them, when I want to see them rather than when my sister needs me). It would greatly help me be able to schedule what I need to do on my days off, without constantly having to change my plans. It would also mean that I wouldn't be forced to see her each week, I could go a few weeks without her and when I do see her, I won't be resentful of having to drop everything to help her. I think it would be great for our relationship, but I am pretty sure that she will get angry and stop talking to me.\n\nAlso, she has made no attempt to find babysitters in her area, probably because when we were young, my mom was broke and hired babysitters that were just bad. But I think that if she took some effort to research them and maybe set up a nanny cam it would reassure her that her kids are safe.

It\u2019s unlikely those sitters will be available at the short notice she \u201cneeds\u201d you; she\u2019ll likely find an excuse not to trust them, and yes, she will probably decide that you\u2019re an AH.", "NTA. Your sister doesn\u2019t want to use babysitters because they cost money and using the services of family members is FREE.", "YWBTA for making that her Xmas gift instead of having a frank, adult, conversation with her. You are not the AH for wanting her to find a babysitter, offering to help with that, or offering a gift card. It\u2019s the way you\u2019re proposing. Xmas is not the season for passive aggressive gifts. Your points are valid - don\u2019t ruin them by giving your sister good reason to turn it back on you, at Xmas no less.", "She does sound truly exhausting and entitled. Presumably because others have enabled her. It\u2019s amazing how the impact of \u201cfalling\u201d just once can change that mindset. \n\nNTA, but I\u2019d be done enabling her.", "NTA. She sounds like a Help Vampire. She feels entitled to your entire attention for watching the kids whenever there\u2019s an \u201cevent\u201d and does nothing to prevent those things from happening. Gotta stop enabling that and talk to her about it too.", "I wouldn't get her the service and I suggest you stop helping her. As long as you keep fixing her problems, she's never going to learn to deal with them on her own. Let her struggle, let her fail, it's the only way she'll ever grow.\n\nNTA", "How old are her children? Do they only have one car?", "NTA. She gets angry and doesn't want to talk to you ? Great, now you don't have to change your plans constantly and get stressed because of it so she can be stress free. \n\nShe's selfish and using you. You better of without her.", "Nope, she will always have a reason for you to watch the kids. If it would help your relationship and give you a break then I see nothing wrong with it. She might choose to take it the wrong way so just be prepared to calmly explain your reasoning and assure her it comes from a good place, that you just want to help alleviate stress for everyone.", "NTA.  You need to learn how to set boundaries.  Read a book like When I Say No, I Feel Guilty.", "NTA: \n\nHow does a school teacher forget about kids having a half day?", "Hmm tricky but I\u2019d say NTA.\n\nShe\u2019s demonstrated that she could really benefit from professional childcare and it gives you an opportunity to decline to rescue her. I think it\u2019s really thoughtful and personally, I would LOVE to receive a gift card for childcare.\n\nIf she doesn\u2019t like the gift, she can regift it, nbd. For her to make a big deal out of it would show her character, not yours. If she stops speaking to you then she risks not having her \u201cdrop everything and save me\u201d babysitter (which my petty self finds hilarious).\n\nSide note: regardless of the gift you give her, I hope you do stop rushing in to save her. I personally think she needs to deal with the consequences of her poor planning. It sounds like these experiences are times where she could\u2019ve planned ahead. Not like \u201cHey one of the kids got sick and I\u2019m stuck in this meeting I have to lead, can you pick them up for me and I\u2019ll head home right after it\u2019s done?\u201d I understand that we make commitments to school and work but my opinion is that the most important commitment we make as parents is to our children. I feel like she\u2019s expecting you to commit to HER children so she doesn\u2019t have to, which is completely unfair.", "YWBTA, but only because some of what you wrote is absolutely a good reason for her to do this herself and will make your gift harder/unlikely for her to use, such as her needing to do her own homework about who she picks to sit. If you get her something prepaid, you\u2019re picking and that\u2019s not likely to go over well. \n\nThis seems like more of a conversation with an offer of payment if payment is an impediment. Maybe offer to take her and her husband out for a short lunch/dinner nearby as a trial run if she meets someone she likes to see how it goes with low stakes before she needs to leave this person with her kids for half a day when she\u2019s unable to abort her own plans. \n\nIf she\u2019s really nervous about sitters in general, a gift card isn\u2019t going to solve her reliance on you.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Maybe give a general gift of an offer to help pay for one one time or something. But regardless of what you decide to do on this, just stop enabling her. If she needs you last minute and you already have plans, tell her no. Do not give a reason. Just a simple \u201cI\u2019m sorry I\u2019m unavailable today/that day\u201d.

She probably won't use the card. \n\nYou'd almost be better off finding and vetting few people yourself to suggest to her.

It sounds like she prefers to call on you rather than to manage her kids and their schedules herself.  \n\nAlthough it's generous of you I don't believe that the problem will be solved with a gift card.

Have you ever successfully told her no without her guilting you? \n\nWhile I think the gift is a good idea in a theory (to send a message that you can\u2019t always drop everything for her), a better idea would be to have the difficult, adult conversation and convey that message with your words.

Giving a gift should be something they will enjoy. I do understand your line of thinking but you\u2019re picking a fight if you do this and that is not the intention of giving gifts", "Fair point. Maybe instead OP could compile a list of good sitters in their area. Her sister may feel better about it if they\u2019re referred by friends", "With her, it's not about the money, she sees the relationship of our extended family where the grandmother becomes a full time babysitter and the aunts and uncles watch the kids too and doesn't understand why we aren't stepping up like them.", "Then OP should have a conversation with her about that. \n\nGiving her a gift she would 'absolutely hate' is passive aggressive and will do nothing but cause resentment.", "Agreed. Her reasons for not hiring a sitter may go beyond money, so this would likely be a wasted gift. I would never just go online and hire a babysitter for a last minute need, because they would be a stranger to my kids. In order to leave my kids with a non-family member, I have to make sure my kids have had a chance to meet that person before in a way that feels safe to them, so it would take time.  \nThis is a conversation that needs to be had, not a gift that needs to be given.

Next time be prepared with a list of when you've babysat at the last minute request.  Say 'no'.
