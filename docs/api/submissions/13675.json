Now let's get down to business and analyze this wild situation you've found yourself in. First of all, your parents disowned you for a choice you made in your life, which, in my humble old-fashioned opinion, is not cool beans at all. Family should be there to support each other, even if they don't always agree with one another's decisions.\n\nNow, when it comes to your righteous dude of a fianc\u00e9, your parents made some seriously uncool accusations, both about him and your relationship. Insisting he was either a figment of your imagination or a pimp is not only insulting but also downright ridiculous. It's important to respect the boundaries they set when they disowned you, but they can't expect you to be all peachy keen when they decide they want back in.\n\nAnd let's not forget that your parents only changed their tune after they found out your fianc\u00e9 is real and has some medical issues. They didn't reach out to genuinely reconnect and apologize for their actions; they wanted to swoop in and \"help\" with his care. That's not groovy at all, my friend.\n\nYour aunt may think that you should forgive them because they're trying to be better, but it's essential to remember that forgiveness is a personal choice. It's entirely up to you if and when you feel ready to forgive and possibly reconnect with your parents.\n\nSo, to sum it all up, you're definitely not the AH here. You have every right to protect your relationship and decide who gets to be a part of your life. Keep on being your fabulous self, and best of luck to your fianc\u00e9 with his surgery! Peace and love, dear one.", "NTA. Doesn't sound like they're actually willing to apologize to you and expect you to forgive them just because.\n\nDon't give in, I mean what are they going to do, disown you? Oh wait...", "NTA. You're happy, you have a good guy, and your parents have been trashing you for years because of your job. Stay salty and be grateful you're free of their judgmental and outdated attitudes.", "NTA\n\nI wouldn\u2019t bother with them. They made their views known and acted accordingly. You have, in return, done the same. You owe them nothing. They can proceed living their life without the daughter they disowned and your fianc\u00e9 that\u2019s merely a figment of your imagination.", "NTA but their comments about your partner are entirely secondary to the fact that they disowned you. That hasn't changed. Why would you want to forgive them now just because they realize there is a \"man in your life\"?", "NTA, if they were \"trying to be better\" they would apologize and take back the awful things they said to you. By offering to \"help\", they're trying to slide back into your life without having to take on any accountability. If you want, tell them (or your aunt) that you'll be happy to accept their \"help\" if they're willing to un-disown you.", "NTA I think it's a little fishy that they want to get friendly again now. I wouldn't trust that their intentions are pure and they just want to meet/help your fiance. Something about their 180 turn from \"you're going to hell!\" to \"let us help\" screams they want to dig into your relationship with him either to see if he knows all of your history oooor... just wondering here, is your fiance financially well off?", "You\u2019re never an asshole for making a boundary when people don\u2019t treat you with respect. NTA.", "NTA. You don\u2019t owe them forgiveness or anything. Protect your peace and leave these toxic and judgemental people out of your life.", "NTA\n\nKeep them out of your life. You don't need them, you have a new life now with a lovely man.\n\nBest wishes and be happy", "NTA.They really should have sincerely apologised first.You deserve better than this strange olive branch. But remember, forgiveness is  mainly a salve  for your own heart, when you truly forgive, they won't affect your peace of mind with their mean spiritedness in quite the same way.  I wish you the very best in your future OP", "NTA. And you don't need these people back in your life - because I bet that given your ages and the fact that you're getting married, all they'll do is pester you for the grandkids they think you owe them.  \n\n\nCongrats on the engagement and I hope the surgery goes well", "NTA, sounds like they can eat shit and die", "NTA\n\nyou could have them meet in a chipotle (or some other restaurant where you pay first) and feel it out one day at a time. but absolutely under no circumstances should you welcome them back into your life unless they sincerely apologize. if they dont, take your burritos home.", "Def NTA, however it could improve your life to forgive them, someday", "I believe in forgiveness. If my daughter told me she was a sex worker I might freak out too. Do you want to deal with this rift forever?  That\u2019s for you to decide.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Whether or not you choose to forgive them it\u2019s your choice and yours alone, and you shouldn\u2019t feel guilted or obligated to feel or do anything simply because of shared chromosomes..

Sometimes, it would last a few months,  the odd time up to a year. The reunions would never involve apologies on either side. I came to terms with the fact that this was his way of dealing,  and he came to find that if he wanted 2 daughters around at Christmas,  he'd have to stop waiting for an apology.  Your situation is much more serious than ours ever were, I fully acknowledge. Just saying, with my father having recently passed, I'm glad none of our disowning periods were permanent.", "Metapod is both wise and groovy. Jumping on this to add that some people use times of illness as a way to regain control over others. You sound like you\u2019ve been living your own life in your own way, OP - by opening the door wide to your parents, you allow them to have control over you during a vulnerable period. \n\nIf you truly want to give them another chance, start small. A lunch somewhere public, bring a friend, hear them out. Nothing that allows them to steamroll their way back into your world.", "Indeed.

I don't think so", ">They didn't reach out to genuinely reconnect and apologize for their actions; they wanted to swoop in and \"help\" with his care.\n\nI'm not so sure that I trust their reasons for \"helping\". **All the pimp comments make me think that they would try and sabotage your relationship with your finance** (especially since he would be in a vunerable state when he is in pain and recovering from surgery). \n\n**If** (and that is only if you feel like you can truly trust them) **you want to spend time with them, don't do it until after your fiance' is totally healed and not in pain.** Whether or not to forgive them should be based on them improving their treatment of you and not because of what your aunt wants/thinks.", "Lol", "Maybe?\n\nSounds like OP's parents may also have old fashioned ideas of gender roles.\n\nSo if OP got a man and was getting married, she was falling into an \"approved\" gender role as a woman.\n\nWould probably still be toxic and expect her to be a SAHM while the fianc\u00e9 works."]}
