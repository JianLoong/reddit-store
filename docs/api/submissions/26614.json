Yes, she can buy whatever she wants and give all of it to you. However, she can\u2019t make you keep or use any of it. Just keep it in the bags and resell or give/throw it all away.

He's not the one popping out a baby, your MIL is not the one popping out the baby.\n\nIt will only get so much worse if you don't stick firmly to this boundary now, and if your husband doesn't support you let him know he can wait with his mom outside the delivery room (or hospital).

I'm a first time mom so I'm sure you know a lot more than me, but I'll put some of the things I did below and maybe some of it could work for you too? \n\n I made a written list of boundaries for after delivery and sent it to all the family. MIL was angry and made angry passive aggressive comments, but in the end she followed them (my favorite comment  was 'I hate that I'm not going to meet baby until they're in college' because we asked everyone to give us two days at home together before visits). \n\n Day of delivery I resent the boundaries when we were checked into the hospital. I didn't have either my mom or his in the delivery room during delivery (granted, my induction turned into an emergency C-section and my mom was out of town for my Papaw's celebration of life so there was no argument there). Once the delivery process started Hubby was in charge of updating everyone.\n\n Hospital policies are all different, but I was only allowed two people, hubby was one and my mom was the other as an emergency (she ended up bringing stuff to us while we stayed over my recovery period, and stayed the night one night to help us). Even though COVID has changed a lot of policies, and they change with percentages, I used policies to my advantage in saying MIL couldn't be there or visit. She kept saying she would wait in the visiting center and have the baby brought out to her, nope sorry that's impossible they no longer have those because of COVID you can't come inside the delivery wing at all without being on an approved list, once the visiting person is assigned it can't be changed even on a different day, can't look at baby in the nursery because they will stay in room with us etc. (in all honesty I bluffed with some of that and it ended up being true once we were checked in). \n\nAnd finally the most important part... no specific thing will work for every family and situation. Set a strong foundation with you and your significant other and stay strong together. And love that sweet baby when they're here \ud83e\udd70 congratulations by the way!! Navigating new baby arrival and family is really tough and I'm wishing you both all the best. Is your daughter excited to be a big sister?", "She WILL show up at the hospital uninvited while you are in labor even if you tell her not to. Unlike my MIL, she will not leave easily after doing so. \n\n Speaking from personal experience here, my (lovely) MIL was so excited for the first grandchild that she drove 3 hours, guessed the correct hospital, and my husband found her in the L&D waiting room EVEN THOUGH we had explicitly told everyone that no one was seeing the baby until later. She left no fuss; you sound like you will have a war on your hands.  \n\nWarm the nurses. Seriously. They will keep her out for you. Your guy sounds very unreliable in his job of mama/baby advocate.", "NYA. I don\u2019t know where you live, but a lot of cities have these great postpartum hotels you can stay in for a week or so that have 24-hour nursing staff for you and your family to help with the baby and lactation and all the stuff so you can get rest and focus on your baby, etc. \n\nCheck in with your husband, baby, and daughter and don\u2019t inform your MIL. She will be knocking down your door at your house while you and the fam are bonding elsewhere.", "I am just so sorry. Donate whatever she gives you. Get a ring for your door.", "I know this sounds like giving in, but after going through this twice, it's better to let her meet the baby a day or two after you give birth, when you're still in the hospital, where you're the center of attention and the nurses can shoo her out after 15   minutes. Have your husband make a big deal of getting a picture of her with her precious grandchild. Then tell her you'll see her in a few weeks. She will not leave you alone until she sees that baby but, once she has, she should be easier to manage.", "NTA - call the cops if you have to. Trust me, just do it", "NTA. Childbirth is not a spectator sport. Don't tell her, and you notify hospital when you check in that you do not want her in your room.", "I am lost at the whole \"forced me into making a baby registry online even though I didn't want one.\"\n\nDid she hold a gun to your head? Tell you she will kill your cat if you don't comply? Threaten to burn down your home? Stomp her feet? Hold her breath until she turned blue? \n\nLook, I understand the issue of being young and having a forceful MIL. I was only 20 when I married my 20-year old bride. She grew up in a culture where the mother controlled the life of the kids even into adulthood/marriage. I grew up in a FU culture. Guess who won the clash? It took a while, and once even telling the wife that I would dump her at her mother's home for good if she took her mother's side against me one more time. She had a long talk with her mother after that, and we had a reasonable truce for the next few decades. But it never goes away completely. Even after 45 years together there was an incident when Mrs. Jack went along with her mother's boundary-crossing desires against my wishes because it was the easiest thing to do. It did not work out well for anyone at that time. \n\nEmbrace the power of \"No.\" Simply \"No.\" Nothing else is needed. And give your husband a dressing down when he needs to have a tougher spine.", "NTA. No is a complete sentence.", "According to your post history, you are recently divorced from your daughter's father/your ex. How long have you been married to this guy, who also according to your post history, you suspect is cheating on you??? Girl, if this isn't fake, what the hell. I call BS.", "NTA and she needs to simmer.  She can certainly buy whatever she wants but you can also donate or sell things you don\u2019t want or need.  You don\u2019t have to live in misery climbing over everything she buys and you def deserve as much privacy as you like during and after the birth of your baby (and any other time as well!)", "You should consider having a video doorbell installed.", "Nta", "So this man who is barely a legal adult is a mama's boy and a cheater.\n\nMaybe try not settling down with folks for a while and just work on you and your kids.  \n\nYikes.", "NTA\n\nDoes she want the cops called on her everyday she attempts to visit uninvited.  Honestly get your boundaries in check now and make sure hubby is on board.\n\nYou husband has to realise that yes being good to your parents is what a good child should do HOWEVER if it comes at the expense of your partner no way.\n\nHonestly if someone is going to let a parent step over the emotional wellbeing of their spouse they should never get into a relationship.", "NTA- and you best get ready to fight with this insane woman every day, or go NC now and save yourself the stress.", "buy MIL a oneway trip to the mars. NTA dont let her pressure you", "Sell it!! Make some money off of it and use it to pay for more locks on the door, or to move to a different state.", "And i would tell her that everytime she shows up uninvited, thats another week added to the time she will have to wait to see your baby", "It's become such a toxic sub though :-(", "You teach people how to treat you. Put your foot down when the baby gets here or she will be running your life forever.", "Make it simple on yourself. If he allows her in, let him know she can pack his things and take him with her when she leaves. You deserve a peaceful recovery and a supportive partner.", "Arrange with the staff a \"safe word\" too. Something like 'pineapple juice'. - asking 'can I have pineapple juice' means please get MIL out. Them asking 'Do you want pineapple juice' can mean Are you OK.", "This is the answer! If he lets MIL in your home after you give birth during those couple of weeks? You will  call the police to remove her and he can pack a bag to go live with his mother.", "Just tell the hospital your husband is the only visitor you approve. At my hospital you can even request they not let people know you're even there. If they call saying \"hi can you connect me to OP's room\" they will say sorry, no OP here. And you as the patient can do this, your husband has no say."]}
