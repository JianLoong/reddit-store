Their ages range from 3-9 years old and between 5-12 of them will come over. I love them all, but as they\u2019ve started to get older, I\u2018ve had to deal with very different personalities as basically all of my siblings have different parenting techniques.\n\nIt\u2019s because of their different parenting styles that we\u2019ve had issues. I have a sister (Belle, 24) who coddles her children and refuses to punish them at all. My brother (Aron, 29) is a lot harsher with his punishments and runs his family like a military. The rest fall somewhere in the middle. They\u2019ve all been pushing me to follow their \u2018techniques\u2019 as they all believe they are right and the rest are wrong.\n\nThings blew up last month because of my 2 aforementioned siblings. I had to put my nephew (4) from Belle on time out for nearly an hour as he launched one of my cats by the tail. I give a 5 minute time out plus an extra minute for every year old they are for serious misbehaviour. However, I don\u2019t start the timer until they stop throwing a tantrum, and I will reset it for the same length of time if they aren\u2019t ready to apologise when the time is up. On the same night, one of my nephews (7) from Aron, put on a tiara and played princess with his sister and some of their cousins\n\nWhen my siblings found out, Aron and Belle went ballistic. I told Belle that her son is old enough to know not to throw a cat and I told Aron that I will not stop any of my niblings from playing with their cousins. They both threatened to stop allowing their kids to come over, but I knew they were not serious and A and his wife relish any alone time they can get, and B has a newborn with colic which has run her and her fianc\u00e9 into the ground. \n\nThis Saturday when they came around to drop their kids off, 5 of my siblings rocked up together with their own sheets of paper with instructions on how they want me to look after their kids, ranging from bedtimes, diets, punishments and so on. I refused to read past the first 2 sheets as they were completely contradictory, and if I enacted them, would make the kids think I\u2019m playing favourites. We got into another argument and again, Aron and Belle told me that as their parents, I need to follow their orders in regards to their children. I said no, that I\u2019m not a hired nanny, that I am their uncle and that I am gonna continue running my home how I see fit.\n\nAll the kids still spent the night at mine, but my siblings are still mad with me.

Lock him in an office or something where he's safe until you can trust them.  \n\nYour siblings seem extremely manipulative.  Withholding babysitting privileges until they acknowledge that you'll be caring for the kids as you please in your house.  Think of it this way, when they go to school or daycare there are different rules to follow.  Its the same thing.  The only exceptions are things like don't feed a vegetarian kid meat.   Otherwise, your house your rules.  Maybe limit the number of kids on a night so you're able to control them better.\n\nHonestly sounds like you're the youngest and they're taking advantage of you.", "He\u2019s never done anything like this before, and when he calmed down I was able to find out that he saw it on Tom and jerry and he understood when I explained how much it hurt Tinky. He\u2019s not a bad kid, he just needs boundaries. \n\nAnd nah if I charge them that\u2019ll just give them power", "Definitely.  I'd give him a time out then tell his parents he's not welcome back until he's older and able to behave.  Oh and by the way, you'll be getting my cats xray bill from the vet tomorrow.  Pay it and any other vet bills or don't ever bring your brat back.", "Honestly it\u2019s mostly just Belle and Aron, they lied to the others and told them I asked for rule sheets", "I thank god every time I don\u2019t have to worry about naps hahaha. The only 2 that have scheduled nap time get dropped off after 5 on Saturday and usually picked up Sunday morning before church, I\u2019ve had to try it a couple of times and I couldn\u2019t get them to calm down because they were excited about their cousins being over", "Nah I\u2019d never spank them, that was actually an argument I had with Aaron because he wanted me to", "Which parameters would you suggest??", "I honestly don\u2019t want that tho, I love spending time with them. My other 3 siblings are pretty right and only brought their lists because Belle and Aron lied to them and said I asked for them. Even the other 2 I\u2019m barely bothered by, I just wanna make sure I\u2019m not doing anything that would be detrimental for the kids. Adults can suck it up hahaha", "It wasn't for an hour, it was for 5 minutes, but the clock resets if they continue the tantrum and/or don't apologize. It's a good system; what's the point of a time out if they don't learn anything?", "It was 9 minutes as they get 5 minutes plus another minute for every year old they are, but I had to set the timer 5 times because he would get mad again when I came over to explain to him what he did was wrong. In  end he understood he hurt Tinky and apologised to him. He\u2019s normally a great kid but saw something on Tom and Jerry and though it\u2019d be funny in real life too.", "He threw a cat by its tail. \n\n*He threw a cat BY ITS TAIL.* \n\nThen had a tantrum about being put in time out. I know he's only 4 but he has to learn how serious this was. \n\nI wouldn't let him back in my house for a long time. Especially with his mom's shit parenting.", "It wasn\u2019t supposed to be an hour, it was supposed to be 9 minutes (5 minutes plus an extra minute for how old they are) but when I came over to explain to him what he did hurt my cat, he\u2019d lash out again so I had to reset the timer and this happened 5 times until he calmed down enough to listen and understand what he did was wrong.", "I had another commenter say that timeouts aren\u2019t the way to go as well, but they didn\u2019t give any alternatives and Google wasn\u2019t any help. How would you correct a violent behaviour?? I\u2019m genuinely curious as I want to do what\u2019s best for the kids", "Yeah it wasn\u2019t supposed to be for an hour, it was only supposed to 9 minutes (5 minutes plus a minute for each year old they are). However, I had to reset it 5 times because when I would walk over to explain to him what he did was wrong, he would scream at me again. The final time tho he understood he hurt Tinky and even apologised to him without me asking him to. \n\nWhat methods do you find work best for correcting bad behaviour??", "I keep them all away from gluten because one is celiac as well as pork as the wife of one of my brothers is Muslim, but I have one parent that wants me to cut out all processed sugars, soy and red meat, and another that wants me to follow Keto. I tried once to cook them all dinners they\u2019d normally have at home and it lead to them all just swapping plates anyway because they were all interested in what the other ones had", "It\u2019s the first time anything like this has happened, I will keep an extra eye on him from now but I\u2019m certain he understands what he did was wrong and that cats have feelings so you can\u2019t treat them like they do in cartoons. The kitties do have a special room to hide in as well when they\u2019re overwhelmed that the kids know not to go into.\n\nNah I\u2019m oldest out of my siblings that I grew up with, but Aron is a year older than me. However, we didn\u2019t become stepbrothers until I was 20 and he was 21 and he didn\u2019t take it all that well that I didn\u2019t respect him as an \u2018older brother\u2019. The other 3 are fine, the only reason they brought sheets was because Belle and Aaron lied to them and told them that I asked for them. You\u2019re smack bang on with Belle tho, she\u2019s the youngest girl and was dad\u2019s little princess, she\u2019s pulled plans like this before. It\u2019s funny because the only time Belle and Aaron get along is to try and pull some pinky and the brain stunt against me hahaha. As soon as I see them together I know something\u2019s up", "Agree! That is what happens when daycares enact late fees! Parents will just pay the fee and be late on purpose. If you start charging, they will feel entitled to consider this a service you provide and feel justified in demanding you do it to their specifications.", "[deleted]", "I'm not suggesting specific ones, but suggesting that just because two of your siblings have been wildly unreasonable, going straight to 'my house, my rules, forever' with your other siblings may not be optimal.  Purely as an example, some kids respond more strongly to food dye.  If that was the case for one of nibling, I would suggest it's just as easy to offer chips that don't have orange dye as to offer ones that do.  If one of your siblings is convinced that lack of flossing is the cause of every disaster since the fall of Rome, take three minutes and at least be sure that kid flosses.  It's about some give and take - again REASONABLY - to acknowledge your siblings as individuals who matter to you and may have different concerns than you do.  Launching the cat or asking you to cut off imaginative play are NOT candidates for this sort of goodwill gesture.", "As a celiac mom I can\u2019t tell you thank you enough!!! It\u2019s so hard on my kiddos when they (no longer the case bc I found out my parents were slipping celiac kiddo gluten on purpose) couldn\u2019t have what their cousins were having. Oh you got an Oreo while we make home made chocolate chip cookies baking in the oven with the other kids. Then they couldn\u2019t understand why my kids were upset. You can only do so much. It sounds like you are trying to make reasonable (reasonable being the key word here) accommodations. Solid boundaries on dietary needs but unless you have a nibbling who has seizures and they are on a zero carb diet for seizure control or they need keto due to type one diabetes\u2026it sounds like you are trying. If they aren\u2019t ok with it\u2026they don\u2019t have to let the kids stay but you will have to be ok with that outcome as well. Once again\u2026you are trying to make reasonable accommodations. If they could only eat and drink what everyone else could\u2026they would be surviving on sunshine and water and I don\u2019t think they are plants.", "Honestly I love having them over and I\u2019m happy to do it for free, plus if I charge them then that just gives them more grounds to try and make demands. It\u2019s only a night a month and they rarely misbehave at mine because they\u2019re too busy playing with their cousins. \n\nI\u2019m not really bothered by them as my siblings have always been a bit difficult so I\u2019ve always give it right back to them. The reason I posted is because I want to make sure what I\u2019m doing won\u2019t have a negative impact on the kids", "Thank you for the advice. Yeah I definitely follow dietary restrictions for allergies and religious purposes. I listen a lot more to my other siblings as they aren\u2019t demanding and what they ask for are easy things to fix like \u2018make sure this niece has her hair brushed before she goes to bed and wakes up\u2019. I don\u2019t take pride in being bossy, but some of things I just can\u2019t do, especially when all 12 of them are over", "I\u2019m sorry to hear what your parents were doing, have they gotten any better with it now??\n\nYeah nah besides the celiac, there\u2019s no other health issues with the kids which is why I\u2019m relaxed with the other stuff. Our grandpa has type 2 diabetes but he used to scull 1.25L bottles of coke as a party trick so there was no shock when he got that diagnosis. I\u2019ll check with Belle\u2019s fianc\u00e9 if he has diabetes in his family, but I doubt it\u2019s coming from him as he\u2019s had fights with my sister for sneaking them things she doesn\u2019t want them to have", "All 12 by yourself? Your siblings should be kissing the ground you walk on. NTA", "Hahaha thanks, but honestly it can be easier when there\u2019s more of them because they all play with each other and I can have a few minutes to go on my phone or something", "Yeah but that\u2019s still a massive amount. I used to babysit a lot and thought six was way too many. NTA btw \ud83d\ude38", "Oh yeah there\u2019s no way I could look after 6 kids that I didn\u2019t know!!"]}
