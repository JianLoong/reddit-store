If you didn't get lied to or cheated on, you have to take responsibility for the fact that you chose to take certain risks. Often you have no idea which one of you contracted it first -- your friend may very well be the vector of infection here, and punishing their partners for sharing important medical information is just childish.", "I think it's ironic that, based on his own rules, this guy shouldn't even be having sex with himself. \n\nBut its his life and he didn't ask for your advice, so YTA for butting in where you're not wanted.", "YTA.

We simply agreed to use condoms with all outside partners and it worked.\n\nCondoms are great and effective but they're also not 100% and if you contract an STI it's both smart and polite to inform your partners even if you've *never* had unprotected sex with them. OP doesn't say a thing about their friend's condom use, so it's possible he's using condoms with all his partners.\n\nETA: Gonna assume everyone downvoting me is a jerk who doesn't tell their recent partners when they contract an STI because \"it's embarrassing\" and \"we used condoms.\"", "This isn\u2019t the question and what 2 consenting adults do is no ones business but theirs.", "The latter. I understand that too. I wouldn\u2019t say that for people that generally have this concern and do all in there power to avoid it, but this isn\u2019t really the same as that, to me at least. maybe it looks the same to you. I don\u2019t think people should engage in activities with risk if any potential outcome of that risk will be an issue. It\u2019s the informed decision for me.", "I agree nothing is 100%. I would be a hypocrite if I said I never had unprotected sex  I do think if you are making a practice of multiple partners unprotected sex is irresponsible. OP was asking if they were the AH. This is what I understood from the post: OP was forcing their opinion on the friend,  and then asked Reddit to opine. I opined my view on a general disregard for protection and maybe I confused the issue. But in the end not telling partners you are not monogamous while having unprotected sex is an AH move. The OP was giving the friend an opinion they didn't ask for another AH move. Calling me out because I gave an opinion that WAS asked for is an AH move. Having sex and respecting your partners is not an AH move. Just giving my opinion which was asked for.", "You are the one putting it out here. You asked an opinion and opinions are like AH everyone has one. So I gave mine.", "Then, it isn't your business if they get tested or not so you shouldn't have weighed in. \n\n(FYI, if people aren't willing to be tested regularly I don't think they should be having sex at all. It's a health and respect concern, and if I was going to engage with someone who reacted that way I simply wouldn't be having sex with them).", "You really can\u2019t say mind your own business when you\u2019re coming to a sub where the entire point is to not mind our business and judge you.", "OK so take your own advice and don't butt into your friends life.  \ud83d\ude43", "You don't know that he *wasn't* telling them he's nonmonogamous. You also have no idea he wasn't using condoms with them. You seem to be making a lot of nasty and completely unfounded assumptions based on a dislike for nonmonogamy in general. \n\nTelling a friend they're being an immature asshole can be a loving move, and is sometimes highly deserved -- as it is here.", "I wasn\u2019t weighing in on getting tested, I was weighing in on their treatment of a person they say is a friend like they didn\u2019t make the informed choice to get into that themselves. Also, people can get tested all the time and it still just happens.", "Lol I guess you got a point.", "Again an opinion was asked for and given. No one has to agree with me. It's MY opinion. As I said in another post. Opinions are like AHs everyone has one. In the end it doesn't matter to me one way or another. And you are making a nasty and unfounded assumption I am against nonmonogamy. To each their own! Just protect your health and heart.", "I see what you mean (had to reread the post again haha), but my point still stands. Either, what happens between two people is their business or it isn't, and you said you think it is :)", "NTA \n\nsexual health is very important and, being a friend, you're obligated to be honest and real with your friend. Not to coddle them. Your friend WAS being immature and ignorant.

AND to inform your partner (s) of your status.", "NTA\u2014at all. There are times when unsolicited advice is inappropriate as hell.

This is one of them. \n\nGood on ya \ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffb", "NAH\n\nYou are allowed to disagree with his practices within his relationships. It does come off as rude to treat someone as tainted. He\u2019s allowed to stop having sex with someone for whatever reason he likes.

I\u2019d come back to them in a non combative way and explain that you value them and their health and leave it at that.

NTA, your friend is an idiot", "NTA  \n\n\nAs a non-practising poly, this is a terrible way for them to behave. STI checkups are health care and should be treated like any other health check. To my mind, poly should encourage acceptance of one another's sexual health and responsible for our own.  \n\n\nMaybe your input was unsolicited, but we are not obliged to not react to something someone tells us.", "NTA. Your friend is very immature especially if they want to be poly.", "I don\u2019t think they don\u2019t take them seriously, they\u2019re pretty diligent about getting tested. They\u2019ve also never had one according to them. I just don\u2019t understand how you can turn around and punish someone for your own choice when theyre doing the right thing and making sure you\u2019re ok. With their reason being they suddenly see someone as \u201cnot caring about themselves [the partner] or them [my friend]\u201d not once that person has tested positive for something, but if my friend then came back as positive for something as well.", "That\u2019s totally the expectation. They just do it if that\u2019s how it turns out.", "No they get regularly tested but it\u2019s not something they really ask or have a convo about with their partners", "Actually, it\u2019s everyone\u2019s business if you\u2019re the one handing out the water that you poisoned.", "How could they have a pattern of behavior that they do when they test positive for an STI and also claim to have never had an STI?", "There are medications you can take to reduce your chances of getting  Hiv along with vacations to prevent others. If you are having sex with multiple partners without protection and not investing in all preventative measures, you're not taking STIs seriously. I'm not saying that out of judgment, I'm just saying protect  yourself and educate others around you to do the same. The way he is treating this person is shitty, but that is the secondary issue.", "Wtf does this even mean dude", "It means you don\u2019t care if you are Patient Zero."]}
