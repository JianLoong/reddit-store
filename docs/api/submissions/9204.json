I have also sent out an application to another restaurant and have not heard back, so I feel like nobody is hiring in my area of expertise.\n\nMy husband told me to give him time to figure something out and that he did not want the members of the extended family to know, at least not for the next month or so. \n\nMy husband's mother and stepfather are both blue collar, but his stepfather's late brother was very successful and his son is as well. My husband's step cousin (49M) owns many businesses, among which are a rehab facility and a moving and storage business.

I broke down and decided to tell him that my husband has been laid off and so we were in a dire financial situation that meant I might have to close my shop. I asked him for advice.\n\nHe told me he wouldn't tell anybody and gave me advice regarding marketing and insisted on giving me the money to cover rent and a marketing budget/ other bills.\n\nI was grateful for his help and used some of the money he gave me to pay down a few credit cards and my husband ended up looking in my desk and finding out he wrote me a check. \n\nHe was furious and called his step cousin, and his step cousin asked why he didn't just tell him that he was in trouble- because he could have floated him a job.

Job loss sucks. I've been there. You feel worthless and like a failure. It's very depressing. These are the issues and emotions your husband is likely feeling. For some people, accepting help can feel like confirmation that you screwed up. I see why you accepted the money. It makes sense from a survival point. Your husband can't see the survival aspect through his emotions right now. That said, your husband's reactions are over the top. He shouldn't be treating a step cousin or anyone like that just bc he needs help. You probably need a job, but not bc your husband says so, bc you need help from family. I'm sorry you are going through all this. It will get better.", "Really?!? Yes YTA. \n\nNot only did you break a promise to your husband by telling someone about his loss, you also took money from someone with no intention of taking your husband about it and paid your credit cards. \n\nYour husband made six figures, had a month off severance, only been laid off for a few weeks and you\u2019re already worried about losing your house?

If you felt that the cousin's money was the only way your family would get through this, you should've talked to your husband first and brought him on board before ever mentioning it to the cousin", "NTA\n\nYou and your husband should always be a team first. However he's making you hide something incredibly stressful and life changing which is a heavy burden to carry alone. I understand why your husband feels he wants to keep this private but it's not like you sought his cousin out to ask for money - it sounds like the conversation came out in a natural way and you really needed at least the advice and emotional support.\n\nUltimately what tipped it is how your husband reacted - a massive fight, yelling at you to get a job, and telling off his cousin for helping? He's letting his fragile ego dictate his response and that's not okay. Would he rather you two get into a financial hole you might not be able to dig yourselves out of??", "YTA.", "ESH. I feel for your husband about losing his job, that\u2019s never easy and got to be a kick in the balls and to his ego. \n\nAnd I get why you need to speak to someone and get advice. But borrowing money from a family member is not usually an advisable idea, and if your husband already has an issue with this man\u2026 you could have picked better. \n\nYour husband sucks because he can\u2019t put his head in the sand and not deal with this. He needs to swallow his pridex", "You asked a business mentor for direction. He offered financial assistance. You accepted for your business. I see no problem there. NTA.\n\nYour husband, on the other hand. Wow. He's panicking and not making good decisions. Does receiving a severance disqualify him from Unemployment Compensation? He should apply to be sure.", "YTA", "I\u2019m a bit conflicted so I\u2019m going ESH. You\u2019re unable to step up and try harder for a second job, he sucks a bit for being unwilling to ask for help. Accepting and asking for money does require knowledge of both of you, but you\u2019re not actually doing anything to help in this stressful situation. He just lost his job and a massive source of income to support your lives, this is not the time to roll over and pretend applying to two jobs before going behind his back to ask for money is a good thing.", "ESH. You should have maybe at least asked your husband before saying something to someone who you probably knew he felt some disdain towards. However, he has shown no understanding of your position and also didn\u2019t show sympathy for your business. He may be upset now but so long as you\u2019re keeping that money it will make sure you at least have a house for another month. It\u2019s a tough position to be in but when you feel so helpless you go to the people who are able to help.", "Kind of an asshole for not breaking your word and your spouses trust on financial issues. Your spouse is a major asshole for essentially making all the financial decisions and stopping you from possibly not having to close your shop(not to mention the job offer).

You are rightfully worried and trying to take action but still kind of betrayed your spouse.", "Yta I can't decide which is worse. The fact that you went out and spread your husband's business or the fact that you actually accepted money like that.", "NTA. Husband needs to learn. Pride don't pay the bills.

Especially before accepting the money. \n\nIf this was a mentor that wasn't affiliated with her husband, I'd be more inclined to agree with you.
