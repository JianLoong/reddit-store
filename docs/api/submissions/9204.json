However he's making you hide something incredibly stressful and life changing which is a heavy burden to carry alone. I understand why your husband feels he wants to keep this private but it's not like you sought his cousin out to ask for money - it sounds like the conversation came out in a natural way and you really needed at least the advice and emotional support.\n\nUltimately what tipped it is how your husband reacted - a massive fight, yelling at you to get a job, and telling off his cousin for helping?

You\u2019re unable to step up and try harder for a second job, he sucks a bit for being unwilling to ask for help.

He just lost his job and a massive source of income to support your lives, this is not the time to roll over and pretend applying to two jobs before going behind his back to ask for money is a good thing.", "ESH. You should have maybe at least asked your husband before saying something to someone who you probably knew he felt some disdain towards.
