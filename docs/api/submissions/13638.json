Kids can seek attention in various ways and your assumption all toddlers are the same shows you haven't interacted with many of them. You can be nice as pie to a kid and still have them be a little shit or you can be mean and push them away and they'll still go for your attention. They're complex little people too you know.", "i typically have poor opinions of rude spoiled children. still am nice to them, even if they arent to me. babysat 4 demonspawn for a summer, got $400 bucks and bruises from getting kicked, punched, and bit. and the mother was still there the whole time, i was just supposed to keep them off her back for a while which didnt work bc she just gave in to everything they wanted. i was always kind to them, but kids that always get their way are terrible.", ">I see y\u2019all are really mad about traditional gender roles lol.\n\nYeah, because you're forcing them on a 4 year old lol. YTA", "It\u2019s just absurd. Who asks a FOUR year old to help move furniture!? Adding the gender comment in there was the cherry on top of ridiculousness.", "You can\u2019t be serious", "Occasionally asking a kid to help move a couch for a max of 20 minutes is now being considered wasting the most carefree years of their life? Seriously?", "He's a brat.  If he's gonna be a brat to me, I'm gonna be a brat back.  I'm not the parent, so I don't have to be nice to him.", "definitely get what you're saying about the level of closeness and the physical contact.  it's just that the contact didn't hurt him it was the equivalent likely of a tap.\n\ni just think that like, the kid is also his own person, and he learns from experiences with everyone, not just people close to him.  we learn from everyone is what i'm trying to say.  it's good to be around different people, different personalities, close or not.  as long as it's not actually harmful.  but obviously if the mom was upset she's not of that opinion i guess.", "I worked in a daycare, I would be shocked to hear a 4 year old speak that way to adults. It is not common.", "He can be taught to not have a rude personality though.", "I mean he turns 4 in a week so he might as well be. I\u2019ve never heard of \u201cfourager\u201d but maybe I\u2019ll get lucky and keep my respectful child lol.", "Op was actually asking for help because of the supposed typical gender roles in the family. Op wasn't  just trying to engage with the child; it was stated op doesn't care for the child", "She doubled down that it's the family gender roles that prompted her to ask. I'm not buying it", "It's wildly inappropriate to ask a 4 year old to move a couch. It makes me question OP's judgement.", "I have kids and have interacted with tons of kids from both genders. The kid is four and OP could have easily used words to change the kids behavior without need to get the parents involved at all. Bumping a 4 year old with a couch because he isn\u2019t moving when you ask him to isn\u2019t an appropriate response.", "Honestly. If grown adults want to split up household tasks based on gender, as long as everybody in that situation consents to that it\u2019s fine. But pushing that on a four year-old and then getting mad that he won\u2019t help move furniture just because he\u2019s a boy is really ridiculous", "Oh no! A small child said one sassy sentence to you, an adult (I assume). Of course you must be mean to him now! How else will you ever recover?", "That\u2019s a great way to model to a child that you think being a brat is an acceptable way to respond to people who are bothering you. \n\nHe\u2019s 4. Kids that age typically don\u2019t understand sarcasm, irony. They respond best to clear, concrete communication.", "Wow you have thin ass skin. If you think that's being a brat, never have kids they can be assholes when they want to be.", "You do not know those kids like you think you do, you know as well as everyone else when they home it's a different ball game but the personality thing stands", "You can have a wank personality but know to have proper manners and respect\n\nSource: that's me", "Could also just be an asshole or have undiagnosed personality disorder y'all jump to conclusions to fast", "Your kid is definitely not as good as you think they are", "Lol, I\u2019m crossing my fingers for you because it is not fun! It happened with all my children, starting shortly after they turned four and then stopped right after turning five. It\u2019s like magically one day they were sweet and respectful again!", "Seriously, wouldn\u2019t most adults - even teens! - just find his comebacks amusing?", "I'm not here to parent somebody else's child.  It's not my responsibility to teach that child right from wrong.  I will respond with how I see fit.  If the parent has an issue, then oh well.", "But it\u2019s clear his mother doesn\u2019t address it. A \u201cdisorder\u201d can still be addressed. He can be told to behave. It\u2019s not an excuse to let a kid be a turd.", "Haha my son is pretty cool. But it\u2019s okay because I also have a 2 year old daughter who is an absolute menace and I\u2019m scared for when she gets older. She will most likely be the \u201cfourager\u201d that pinkfuneral is talking about.", "It\u2019s not your job to parent them or teach them right from wrong, but it\u2019s pretty hypocritical to complain about a kid being a brat when you think it\u2019s okay to act like a brat too.", "Meh, I'm only giving the kid a taste of his own medicine.", "Please turn your brain on the next time you decide to post on reddit"]}
