The other day, she invited me over to hang out. Her cousin (around 25F) and god son (4M) were also there. I have been around her godson before and he frequently makes disrespectful remarks and does things to be rude. My best friend agrees but is apprehensive to be stern with him, especially in front of his mother who is her cousin. It should also be noted that it\u2019s clear he loves attention and is always amongst adults making comments and chiming in like he\u2019s also an adult. \n\nWhen I arrived, a lizard had gotten into the house somehow so my best friend asked me to help get it out. I had to rearrange some furniture in the living room as I was sure the lizard would try to hide under couches and tables when we attempted to capture it. Anyway, I asked her god son to help me with pushing the couch, as he\u2019s a boy, and it\u2019s typical in her family to teach the males to help with these types of things. He told me \u201cyou do it.\u201d His mother is my best friend\u2019s cousin, who was also there, but as usual, she said nothing to his remark. I didn\u2019t push, as he isn\u2019t obligated to help but I did ask to see if he\u2019d be willing. I proceeded to move the couch myself. \n\nFast forward to lots of commotion with the lizard running every where but back outside, the god son being loud, my best friend being scared, and her cousin laughing lol. It\u2019s no big deal to me, and honestly I found it quite fun. However, at one point we lost the lizard so I lifted up the couch and asked her god son if he saw it under the couch. His response to me was, \u201cwhat do you think?\u201d in a snarky manner. Once again, another rude response that no one addressed. I just kept searching myself. \n\nThe issue is once we captured the lizard and got it outside, I began putting all the furniture back. The god son was standing in the way of where the couch goes. I said, \u201cexcuse me.\u201d In his classic nature, he just stood there and looked at me. So I proceeded to push the couch into him. I did not hurt him, nor did I push it hard, but enough for him to get the picture that I actually need him to move. So anyway, he moved, giggled a bit and I finished putting everything back. \n\nA few days later, my best friend tells me that I shouldn\u2019t have done that in front of his mother and that she won\u2019t invite both of us to her house at the same time anymore. So AITA for pushing the couch into him after asking him nicely to move?\n\nEdit: I see y\u2019all are really mad about traditional gender roles lol. As I stated in my original post, this is typical for their family. When I got there, it was told to him he should get the lizard since he\u2019s the man in the house.

The \"man of the house\" attitude is a part of socialization that is helping create his ego. The whole \"acting like an adult\" thing and his snarky 'I'm-better-than-everyone\" attitude are evident through that. Calling him the man when he is just a boy, and the whole usage of \"the\", it's giving the kid too much credit. I'm analyzing a sentence, but it's less about the sentence but rather the implications for the position he is being socialised into thinking he has. I would also like to question where the child is learning to imitate that behaviour, from your edit it does sound like maybe that's how he sees his family members interact. The mom didn't correct him so I wouldn't be surprised if both what I said was the case and if he doesn't get enough time from his family members.\n\nI have seen your edit and that it's how they do things in their family, but that does not mean you need to play into that - assuming you asked for his help with the goal of teaching him social skills, cuz obviously a 4-year-old won't have much couch pushing strength. You can simply treat him as you would any other child, without of course actively going against their family's norms for the sake of respect.\n\nIn the future there are better ways to deal with it, you could have asked him to move, and then and only then do what you did on the basis of him ignoring a very clear request. Though the kiddo giggled.\n\nI also wouldn't take his remarks/behaviour to heart. That kid has a tough life ahead of him if this is where his social skills are. His family is failing to socialize him in a proper manner. I'm cool with some snarky and cocky behaviour, but there is a time, place and limit to it. Overall younger kids (like toddlers aka a 4 year old) tend to not understand manners that well and be snarky, so maybe to some extend he will grow out of it, but I do think that due to the extend of his rude behaviour, it's highly due to a lack of proper socialization into social norms.", "YTA my dude, you're beefing with an actual baby", "It was an obvious NTA for me at first because I read it as 14.

The tables are turned and suddenly, it's the adult that needs the kid's help. They LOVE this! It makes them feel capable, trustworthy, and bonds them with the adult they're helping. They also walk away from the experience with a sense of accomplishment and higher self-esteem. Our kid can't see me preparing dinner without begging to help. She loves to wear her chef's hat and be in charge of gently mixing the pasta sauce if we're having spaghetti that night. Etc. Little things like that are great for children's growth. \n\nThe mother in this story should've encouraged the kid to help OP in his small way so he could've felt useful and heroic when the adults applauded his efforts afterward.

She should be saying \u201cit\u2019s disrespectful to talk to me that way and I won\u2019t be talking to you unless you are kind.\u201d Then proceed to treat him as if he doesn\u2019t exist until he can not be a jerk.  It\u2019s the adult version of \u201cI won\u2019t play with you if you are mean.\u201d", "....no, four year olds are not typically that rude and disrespectful", "She pushed him out of the way. Sliding the couch across the floor\u2026 do you thing she lifted a couch over her head and slammed it onto the child? This is not a big deal. \n\nAnd the kid is four. And a AH. I don\u2019t think you have any experience with raising healthy children if you think that is typical.", "Dude. I am a teacher to kids from 4-12. Believe me, there is no harm in a humorous, harmless  \u201cthreat\u201d like getting crushed with a couch if they don\u2019t move out of the way. !Obviously, OP wasn\u2019t going to crush the kid; like come the fuck on. Lessons tend to stick way more if kids FEEL the consequences of not following the rules, and that\u2019s what OP did for them. I always try to give the kids a taste of the consequences because it works! And that\u2019s what OP did here. Frankly, if you think a gentle, harmless push is abusive,  then you\u2019ve got a very vanilla sense of humor, or you have very distorted views about abuse.", "She didn't elaborate why she would need to be accused (obviously the kid didn't get it sometimes means 'move'). Instead she physically attacked him", "Do you hit them with furniture when they don\u2019t want to help?", "That IS bad for a child his age.", "1000% THIS. Small children need structure and boundaries. Manners are part of that foundational structure. It\u2019s not difficult to instill respect. We already know this kid is a pain in the ass and obviously his mother thinks it\u2019s cute. I wonder if he does this with dad, or maybe that\u2019s where this behavior comes from.", "And encouraged. It\u2019s not as cute as parents think it is.", "Being taught, being ignored and will only get worse.  Mom will be sorry for raising a disrespectful little snot.", "This is what I want to know. We had to move furniture around for a deep clean of the living room and as much as he wanted to help, NO. WAY. would I expect him to really help me move that chair or lift the sofa.", "Doesn\u2019t mean OP isn\u2019t a dick.", "What exactly was so bad about what the kid said? Like I truly cannot comprehend what people are so worked up about.", "Actually she already lost me when she complained about how he was speaking when adults were talking. How dares he?!? Like four years old are people too, why shouldn't they jump into a talk of a group they are part of? I mean sure, four years old may not understand what the adults are talking about but so what? \n\nWell, I admit it reminds me of my own Mum although it was never about respect. I have three elder sisters, at least nine years of an age gap between us, you know how annoyed teenagers can get. Not even them expected me to shout my mouth when I was sitting with them just because I was a kid. But my Mum liked to tell me I would not understand that when actually she was just not able to explain or she herself was the one not understanding everything. I love her but well, she never was the brightest candle on the cake. Therefore I don't even think you should tell kids then they do not understand, what of course was just another way to tell me that this wasn't a talk I should say something or ask questions. Just try to explain it to them. Why are so many people about keeping kids \"stupid?\"\n\nAnd that's all being said by someone who has no children and is really not a kids person although they really love me - well, yes, I guess because I treat them like persons and not like little stupids who should just shut their mouthes when adults are speaking.\n\nAnd if it is about something it was rude for anyone to just jump into a talk then you explain it to them but obviously it wasn't something like that but that kiddo dares to not feel excluded because of his age from the group he is part of.", "You\u2019re a great speller for a four year old, damn.", "Which is why they need to be *raised*.", "I was that 4yr old with a father that enabled me to be like this. No one liked me or wanted to be my friend. It's not like the movies how it was in the movies or shows I was imitating, this behavior sucks for the kid when he interacts with people who don't think it's cute and are far less nice than OP. He doesn't know what he's doing is bad at this age but is still being rewarded for it", "As a teacher to young kids, I agree.", "I work with kids too and you don\u2019t nudge a child with furniture, especially someone else\u2019s child. In the title she freely admits she wasn\u2019t gentle.", "Yah in terms of child development, this would be a big red flag for me if I was doing any kind of assessment on that child.", "You might not, but I absolutely would and I really don't get why everyone is latching on to that point like she hulked a car at an infant. It's a way of showing kids what happens if they don't listen. I'm not saying I'd come in from the top rope with a folding chair. Just a nudge or a bump so they understand they need to move and then we'd talk about it. And in the actual story it sounds pretty gentle. The kid giggled and ran away. He knew what he was doing.", "Exactly. 6-8, that would be a bit more normal, although it would still need to be addressed obviously. But I\u2019ve never worked with a toddler that wasn\u2019t very eager in general to make the adults around them happy. They may be chaotic little mess tornadoes, their emotions may overwhelm them and have a temper tantrum, but  that sort of snark isn\u2019t something I\u2019ve ever experienced with a 4 year old. Not that they won\u2019t be mean, but it\u2019s more along the lines of \u201cI hate you!\u201d Or pointing out a physical flaw and telling you what they think about it.  In fact, there\u2019s only one 5 year old I can remember who was sarcastic, and she was a very bright girl. She didn\u2019t totally grasp what she was doing, she just watched a lot of kid shows where the main characters were snarky and picked up on it. Again, it wasn\u2019t because she was a bad kid, she was in general well behaved and very bright.\n\nI certainly wouldn\u2019t shove a couch into a 4 year old (lol), even though it sound like it was gentle enough that it made him laugh. I would most likely not give him any reaction, and than be observing him for a while with other kids and his family to try to see where this behavior was coming from. Is he parroting his older siblings? Is this how his parents/primary care givers speak to each other? Something isn\u2019t right.", "He probably doesn't really understand it but is just mimicking whats he's heard adults say and keeps doing it because it gets him attention.", " I know, right? Who even gets offended if a four year old is 'rude'? I'd probably barely notice", "They were trying to engage with the child", "Because he's a boy and 'that's the way they do it in that family'. \n\nI don't know, either.", "Oh yeah, he was soooooooo disrespectful. /s \n\n4. Years old, people! You were rude at 4 years old, too.", "Yeah that isn't the most insane thing I ever heard. We do not give consequences to other people's children. We talk to the other parent about it.  Jesus.", ">So I proceeded to push the couch into him\n\nThis line cracks me up so much. Like it's the logical next step. 'Of course, I pushed the couch into him' \ud83e\udd23 Also, I'm surprised she could move it, as a woman", "Seems like OP is upset that he was infringing on her best friend time.", "you're a little insensitive towards these things. He's 4.", "The kid was just being a typical four year old. His reaction shows the push was fine. This was the response he was looking for, he just wanted to keep playing after what would have seemed like a fun game of catch the lizard. NAH, friend is probably being over sensitive.", "I can\u2019t think of a more straightforward and harmless way to show them why it\u2019s important to move when someone asks you to.", "I have met plenty of four year olds who are not this perceptive or capable of situational analysis in a way to be so specifically condescending and rude.\n\nI'm both impressed with the four year old and disappointed with the adults in his life, provided this situation actually happened.", "Omg, I'm so glad this comment is high up--I totally thought the kid was 14!", "Nah it\u2019s called a natural consequences (mom of a much-loved 4YO here).", "She said after she pushed the couch that he giggled and walked away. Kids are not little dolls . Kid was fine. Clearly she wasn\u2019t being rough or aggressive or anything.", "Oh I definitely would\u2019ve started pushing the couch \u201cinto\u201d my five year old if she was doing this. The same way, when I tell her to pick up toys because I\u2019m about to vacuum, I would start to \u201csuck up\u201d her toys if she didn\u2019t pick them up. It\u2019s pretty age-appropriate behavior (though the rudeness is not super typical) and sometimes a more direct approach is necessary. \n\n\u201cI need you to move so I can put the sofa back\u201d : something a four year old might a) not entirely understand and b) think is an opportunity for a game \n\n*actually starting to push the sofa back into place* : something that signals \u201coh, I need to move\u201d and still may be seen as a \u201cwho can move the fastest\u201d game\n\n(Edit: format)", "The amount of people saying the kid is rude and going to be ruined for not being taught manners, is ducking mind blowing. This is a FOUR YEAR OLD. A BABY. HIS MOM STILL WIPES HIS BUTT. And he\u2019s being expected to move furniture and having it pushed into him because he did not move out of the way? How the hell can anyone justify any of this?", "He's incredibly young. His brain is too little too understand sarcasm, he may be mimicking to fit in. There's no malice here.", "4 year olds don\u2019t fully understand social cues. But sure, blame it on the \u201cbad mom\u201d rather than the adult who didn\u2019t clearly communicate his expectations to a child.", "Respectfully, some kids are witty.  What do you think Jim Carrey was like when he was 4? Kids are funny.  There's a show called \"kids say the darndest things for a reason.\" My kids make me laugh all the time.", "I\u2019m going to let my toddler give the same energy back. You can very obviously tell the toddler does not like her and she doesn\u2019t like him. Makes me wonder if she\u2019s rude to him but not disclosing that.", "I agree kids love to think they're helping, even if they're barely doing anything, and I find it really cute, but the 'he has to move the sofa because he's a *boy'* thing is really cringey. And when he started getting confused/didn't want to help anymore, OP should've let it go instead of heaving the sofa at him (never thought I'd type that sentence lol)", "It wasn't washing a carrot. It was moving a couch. No opportunity missed.", "I work at Preschool and kids talk that way all the time. It is actually much worse most of the time.", "I gotta know what day care you worked at because every one I\u2019ve worked at has had at least a couple that age who are like that.", "Right. But I would also be shocked to hear an adult act like a 4yr old is a new breed. Shocked he wants/loves attention or is in the conversation. Then to ask him for help (just because hes a boy, instead of asking the adults) & gets offended the 4yr old refuses? Thats not normal either. Neither is pushing him out of the way with furniture instead of asking an adult to move him. We lead by example, sounds like kid doesnt have anyone to show him how to behave", "Jesus, people in this thread have no idea what four year olds are like.", "Lol exactly! They're more like \"why are you fat?\" \"You're ugly\" \"go away, I don't want to!\". I don't want to call this person a liar but either they aged them incorrectly or the kid's much smarter than the norm", "I thought OP was asking him to help find the lizard \ud83e\udd8e, not move the sofa.", "Both"]}
