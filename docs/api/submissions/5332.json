If SIL left after her comments more there likely she knew she was wrong", "Who said she wasn't calling out the parents? I think the consensus is SIL shouldn't have been saying those things where her nephew could hear, which is why everyone has been saying ESH.\n\nIt doesn't sound like she was talking directly to the nephew (that would still have made it ESH but it would also be insane) but she was raising her voice enough for him to hear and get scared, which is what matters.", "So SIL raising her voice and saying they only cared about there little prince isn\u2019t passive aggressive?", "You could, if you were inventing things in your head about me being all over the comments of this post.", "You can\u2019t even get the facts of the story straight.

There is nothing passive about raising your voice for one lol", "I have invented a thing about this post. I have addressed what op has stated and I can see how she is not the A in this situation.", "Wouldn\u2019t that make her husband obtuse?  I\u2019m confused on how op defending her kid( leave the house) is bad. Should she have told SIL to just shut would that have need better? SIL literally have issues with HER parent but made snide comments at dinner attacking op kid because the grown women feels away with her parents and doesn\u2019t have to ball to address them directly. It\u2019s", "Ok I\u2019m loosing myself in the semantics. Why can\u2019t SIL ask her parents why they treat the children differently directly?

And he\u2019s still getting his tuition paid for, his clothes, his gaming systems, ect\u2026 by our grandparents.

We girls are 4th class bellow our brothers, their spouses and their kids. often we are even demoted to 5th class if neighbors, relatives or outsiders are involved.\n\nsame carries for the grandkids. Mom will tear down my sister's kids and blame them if any of my brother's kids did something. she always is ready to run and comfort them while sister's kids are left to their mother. she will shush sister's kids, but laugh and claps even if my brothers kids are hitting her. she always asks if brother's kids ate and if they need her to cook or order something else even if the meal has several dishes but she will get angry is sister's kids does not eat the single meal available or if they asked for something else.\n\nthe kicker is,  3 out of my 4  brothers work outside of the city during the weekdays and come back to ours on the weekends. Because of this,  during the weekdays, where she only have sister's kids (sis and bil live in the same neighborhood as us) she dots on them completely. Its very confusing to the kids where one day they have lovely grandma then the minute their cousins are here then its bad grandma.\n\none of the things mom hates about me is that i call her out of it every single time. I tell her she is being cruel to her grandkids and us then she starts either crying dramatically (accusing me of wanting her to die so i can kick her boys out of  our lives) or she gets angry and shouts or leaves the room to shout the whole house down. She justifies this saying she only gets to see them on the weekend, but i call her BS since she did the exact same thing for 19 years with the brother whole lived with us since he got married and refused to leave the house. Him and his family were living with us all these years , 24/7 and mom STILL treated us and sister's kids the same.\n\nrecently in the last couple of years she is sneakily trying to find a way to add my brother's to the deed of the new house (legally not possible) so they can have a claim on the new house we shifted to 3 years back. I gleefully tell her she cannot and the law does not allow it and she gets super angry and wails (where will my boys live ? and what will happen to their kids? ) as it they don't have homes already.

Instead, she chose to stick up her nose, basically acknowledge her son is favored, and you can leave if you don\u2019t like it.

YTA", "YTA, your son will grow up with that entitled attitude and you're doing nothing to keep it from getting worse. IMO you are the worst type of parent because you truly believe your \"little prince\" is special. Newsflash: he isn't. He will grow into an insufferable adult if he's catered to like this, and those poor girls will only feel more ignored as the years tick by. You guys need therapy, and you owe your sister in law an apology. That whole \"I think they've asked the girls comment\" made me want to barf.", "You\u2019re not the asshole. Your in-laws may be the assholes though. If the in-laws are showing your son favoritism over your sister-in-law\u2019s children, that is genuinely hurtful and wrong. It deserves to be discussed by her with them but it was absolutely unacceptable to drag your son and you into this. You reacted as a mother who didn\u2019t want her son to be made to feel he did something wrong when he clearly didn\u2019t. Continue to make sure your son knows that none of this was on him. It\u2019s not his fault or his responsibility to manage. He needs to hear that from you.\n\nI don\u2019t have enough information here to say whether your in-laws are actually showing your son favoritism in a harmful way or if your sister is imagining or exaggerating this. What I do know is that things like this go on in families and if it is allowed to continue, it harms everyone involved, especially the youth in the family.\n\nI would talk to your sister-in-law one on one about this later with no one else around if possible. I\u2019d start by saying something like \u201cI hope you understand that the other day when I was saying that you could go home, I was trying to protect my son from being made to feel bad about something he has no control over and no responsibility for. Your actions were very hurtful to him. However, I\u2019ve been thinking about what you were saying and if you really feel like the in-laws are showing favoritism to my son and not your children, I don\u2019t want you and your children to feel that way. We\u2019re both mothers trying to defend our children\u2019s rights so maybe you can tell me more about where this is coming from, from your perspective.\u201d Then listen and see what she says. Listen with an open mind and as little bias as possible. Put yourself in her shoes and her children\u2019s shoes as she speaks.\n\nIf after the conversation you still think her concerns are irrational, then you\u2019ll have some grounds to make that judgment. Then you can just wrap the conversation up and say \u201cI\u2019m glad we talked. No hard feelings.\u201d\n\nIf, however, you find yourself thinking \u201cMaybe she has some good points. My in-laws do sort of treat her children with less respect than my son\u201d maybe you can broach this issue tactfully with your in-laws along with your spouse and let them know that you want to make sure all of the children in the family feel valued and included, not just yours. It could be something they can address afterward. And if you notice this happening in the moment, you can also steer the conversation in more equitable directions around the in-laws. For example, in the example above, after your son said he wanted pizza or whatever, you could say \u201cMary and Ellen (or whatever these children\u2019s names are), what do you want for dinner? Do y\u2019all have a preference too?\u201d so that the in-laws are forced to consider everyone\u2019s perspectives and know that you\u2019re not going to just go along with inequitable treatment of children just because it benefits your son.\n\nMy suspicion is that even though you were not the asshole here as you were just trying to defend your son, your sister-in-law may have some reasonable concerns and want to make sure her children are treated fairly too. She could have perhaps handled this better, but it may be a dynamic she has silently seethed over for a long time and finally got the courage to speak up about. It\u2019s easy for me to picture her telling her side of the story in a thread like this in a way that would make me tell her she is not the asshole either.\n\nThe bottom line is that favoritism in families can occur for many reasons or for no real reason at all, but it will drive a wedge among everyone involved, especially your brother and his cousins, if the adults don\u2019t take it upon themselves to ensure that these young people are all treated fairly. You and your sister-in-law need to make sure you are not making this about y\u2019all, but about these children - all of them. You were right to defend your son and it is possible that your sister-in-law was doing the same thing as best she knew how - defending her children. You can potentially help to bring everyone together and squash potential resentments early on if you play this right. \n\nI cannot say for sure that this is actually the dynamic in your family. Maybe your sister-in-law is mistaken. But maybe she\u2019s not and it\u2019s worth really talking to her, maybe in a heart to heart over the phone or some such, to try to get a handle on what is really going on from her perspective and how both of you can make sure all of your children have good relationships with their grandparents and each other.", "I would go full T A for OP actually, I mean she doesn\u2019t want her son to be upset, ok, actually I think I will vote ESH, OP for asking SIL to leave and SIL for apologizing to the in-laws.", "Who owns the house, you or your mother?  I don't quite understand her trying to add someone to your house.", "No it is her job. Me and my sisters were treated differently to other grandkids, very painfully obvious even at a young age. It resulted in my mum cutting off her mum for masses of time more than once. We all have a relationship now, but when I was pregnant, my sister was pregnant with her 3rd. I told everyone there would be no favourites. If hers were treated better than mine I will be removing my child from those who do so he doesn't grow up feeling how I did. I also said that if my child was clearly favoured over hers, I would tell them straight that it isn't on and to treat them equally or not be a part of my kids life. It isn't fair to let innocent children be treated differently, whether the reason is it's a golden child's kid or gender, whatever.. It isn't acceptable. Yes, the SIL needs to tell her parents it is unacceptable, but I personally wouldn't stand back and let kids see blatant favouritism time and time again.", "This is probably OP, she made another account just to justify her actions.", "Where in OP's post did it say SIL said anything to the child? \n\nSIL was making the to the in-laws in earshot of the child. That's different to saying them directly to the child. \n\n>This is not her family\n\nYes it is.  She married into so they are her family as well  as her husband.  They should both present a united front amd address the favouritism but they won't because it benefits their child.\n\nOP - ESH instead of letting your in-laws handle your SIL childish level of communication, since it was directed at them, you should have removed your son from the environment to help him regulate.  Explaining sometimes people say hurtful things when they are upset and hurt, it's not right and we try to do better than that ourselves.  Instead, you didn't and futher aggravated the situation.", "OP, I don't think you should make another account just to defend yourself anonymously. Just accept the verdict, and Don't try to manipulate it", "Yes, she did. She said \"you are favoring your little prince.\" That's not passive aggression, that's direct communication. Passive aggression would be saying out loud \"boy, I wonder who the favorite grandchild is?\" Or \"I guess our daughter's opinions don't matter,\" directed towards her husband.", "Huh? You are pretty sure the others were asked? Really? But in both the post and your other comment you say that they weren\u2019t asked ever. You don\u2019t seem like a reliable narrator so I guess that your son is really favored by the grandparents and this dinner thing was just kind of a last straw for SIL.", "How else do you ensure you're not raising a spoilt brat?", ">passive aggressive\n\nYou keep using those words....\n\nAnd so on and so forth."]}
