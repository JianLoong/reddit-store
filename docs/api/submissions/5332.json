Your in-laws may be the assholes though. If the in-laws are showing your son favoritism over your sister-in-law\u2019s children, that is genuinely hurtful and wrong. It deserves to be discussed by her with them but it was absolutely unacceptable to drag your son and you into this. You reacted as a mother who didn\u2019t want her son to be made to feel he did something wrong when he clearly didn\u2019t. Continue to make sure your son knows that none of this was on him. It\u2019s not his fault or his responsibility to manage. He needs to hear that from you.\n\nI don\u2019t have enough information here to say whether your in-laws are actually showing your son favoritism in a harmful way or if your sister is imagining or exaggerating this. What I do know is that things like this go on in families and if it is allowed to continue, it harms everyone involved, especially the youth in the family.\n\nI would talk to your sister-in-law one on one about this later with no one else around if possible. I\u2019d start by saying something like \u201cI hope you understand that the other day when I was saying that you could go home, I was trying to protect my son from being made to feel bad about something he has no control over and no responsibility for. Your actions were very hurtful to him. However, I\u2019ve been thinking about what you were saying and if you really feel like the in-laws are showing favoritism to my son and not your children, I don\u2019t want you and your children to feel that way. We\u2019re both mothers trying to defend our children\u2019s rights so maybe you can tell me more about where this is coming from, from your perspective.\u201d Then listen and see what she says. Listen with an open mind and as little bias as possible. Put yourself in her shoes and her children\u2019s shoes as she speaks.\n\nIf after the conversation you still think her concerns are irrational, then you\u2019ll have some grounds to make that judgment. Then you can just wrap the conversation up and say \u201cI\u2019m glad we talked. No hard feelings.\u201d\n\nIf, however, you find yourself thinking \u201cMaybe she has some good points. My in-laws do sort of treat her children with less respect than my son\u201d maybe you can broach this issue tactfully with your in-laws along with your spouse and let them know that you want to make sure all of the children in the family feel valued and included, not just yours. It could be something they can address afterward. And if you notice this happening in the moment, you can also steer the conversation in more equitable directions around the in-laws. For example, in the example above, after your son said he wanted pizza or whatever, you could say \u201cMary and Ellen (or whatever these children\u2019s names are), what do you want for dinner? Do y\u2019all have a preference too?\u201d so that the in-laws are forced to consider everyone\u2019s perspectives and know that you\u2019re not going to just go along with inequitable treatment of children just because it benefits your son.\n\nMy suspicion is that even though you were not the asshole here as you were just trying to defend your son, your sister-in-law may have some reasonable concerns and want to make sure her children are treated fairly too. She could have perhaps handled this better, but it may be a dynamic she has silently seethed over for a long time and finally got the courage to speak up about. It\u2019s easy for me to picture her telling her side of the story in a thread like this in a way that would make me tell her she is not the asshole either.\n\nThe bottom line is that favoritism in families can occur for many reasons or for no real reason at all, but it will drive a wedge among everyone involved, especially your brother and his cousins, if the adults don\u2019t take it upon themselves to ensure that these young people are all treated fairly. You and your sister-in-law need to make sure you are not making this about y\u2019all, but about these children - all of them. You were right to defend your son and it is possible that your sister-in-law was doing the same thing as best she knew how - defending her children. You can potentially help to bring everyone together and squash potential resentments early on if you play this right. \n\nI cannot say for sure that this is actually the dynamic in your family. Maybe your sister-in-law is mistaken. But maybe she\u2019s not and it\u2019s worth really talking to her, maybe in a heart to heart over the phone or some such, to try to get a handle on what is really going on from her perspective and how both of you can make sure all of your children have good relationships with their grandparents and each other.", "I would go full T A for OP actually, I mean she doesn\u2019t want her son to be upset, ok, actually I think I will vote ESH, OP for asking SIL to leave and SIL for apologizing to the in-laws.", "Who owns the house, you or your mother?

I told everyone there would be no favourites. If hers were treated better than mine I will be removing my child from those who do so he doesn't grow up feeling how I did. I also said that if my child was clearly favoured over hers, I would tell them straight that it isn't on and to treat them equally or not be a part of my kids life. It isn't fair to let innocent children be treated differently, whether the reason is it's a golden child's kid or gender, whatever.. It isn't acceptable.
