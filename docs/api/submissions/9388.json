Don't  ever feel guilty about not wanting someone to touch or hug you without your permission.  You have a right to body automony and this kid being in special ed does not give him the right to violate  your personal space.", "NTA.  Even kids with disabilities can be taught about personal space and to not touch others.  There\u2019s no excuse that allows someone to touch you.  \n\nYou are allowed healthy and normal boundaries.  Only you get to decide who touches you.  This does not make you a bad person.  \n\nPlease tell your parents and let the school know.  The school needs to work on his behaviour and get him more support to correct before he hurts you or someone else.", "NTA. Private space is private space. You\u2019ve told him several times no, he hasn\u2019t listened. His teacher has told him no, he still hasn\u2019t listened.", "NTA. Other people's needs, despite how special, never trump your right to bodily autonomy.", "NTA.\n\nEven if he has some sort of neurodiversity it does not give him the right to hug you. It is important for him to learn about consent. As long as you arent mean about it (which you weren't) there is no issue.", "Bodily autonomy applies to everyone.\n\nIf you don't want to hug this person, you don't have to.\n\nAnyone telling you otherwise is wrong.\n\nNTA", "I\u2019m the sister of a special needs brother who had to be taught about personal space and boundaries when he was younger.  I\u2019m also a retired teacher. I encourage you to go to the special education/life skills teacher and tell them how many times it\u2019s been happening and how uncomfortable it makes you feel.  They may not have the big picture regarding this boy and you\u2019ll be doing everyone a big favor by sharing this information with them.  It will be very credible information since the behavior was observed this time by one of the staff.  Addressing this behavior belongs in his IEP.\n\nNTA", "NTA, it seems harsh sure, but personal boundaries is something he'll need to learn to function in society. Alot of focus in special education classes are simple skills and lessons like this to prepare kids for the real world so really you're helping not hurting. Though I agree, it feels wrong.", "NTA. You have the right to boundaries and consent. His inability to see this from disability doesn't negate your rights.\n\nI think it was very appropriate that you just left. In fact, it should become what you do every time he tries to hug you without permission. That will be the consequence for violating your boundary.", "NTA. You have the right to draw a boundary on who touches your body. Never the AH for that. Ever.", "NTA. I would try to avoid him for a while, kids with disabilities can really struggle with the concept of consent.", "NTA- given the fact that the special education teacher corrected him, this is probably a known behavioral issue the teacher + kid are working on together. If you feel comfortable you should go to his teacher and talk to them about this! They may have some strategies to help i.e maybe he doesn't understand that you don't like hugs, but would understand if you phrased it as hands to self please. At the very least, the teachers will keep a closer eye if they know this is an issue with you specifically. It keeps you safe AND increases his learning. A win win.", "NTA. But you can always have a short but Pleasant conversation with him. You could tell him you'll always be glad to be his friend. But you want to be just friends with no hugging\n\nSometimes, slower people appreciate having things explained to them gently and kindly.", "Go ask his special Ed teacher how to handle the situation. They probably have a standard response to deal with this behavior (like it might be to put one arm up and say \"no thank you\", or it might be to take a step back and say \" high five or fist bump?\" You could also email if you don't want to go in person. His teacher will want to help him integrate in the school in a safe and healthy way. I guarantee the teacher does not think he has a free pass to do unwanted touching--teens with special needs MUST learn to interact with others in a way that won't get them in trouble in the community.", "No, you're fine probably NAH, he clearly doesn't understand boundaries and needs to be working on that but that's not your business or your responsibility. It sounds like you're doing exactly what you need to be doing, you're answering him honestly and kindly as you can and physically moving is not an ah move. I've had this experience in hs with a classmate with special needs who kind of latched onto me, it can be awkward and you're within your rights to politely decline and to move away from him if he's getting in your space.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

If someone touches you without your consent its not okay. Have you tried talking to them about personal space and how him doing that makes you feel uncomfortable? If he's not mentally able to understand that, maybe talk to one of the spec ed helpers about what he's doing.", "They invaded your personal space. You did nothing wrong. NTA", "NTA never the ah foe not wanting to hug someone, regardless of who they are or any disabilities they may have. You have full control over who touches you. You've asked several times for him to respect that, and his teacher backed you up by telling him not to hug people. Try not to stress about it.", "NTA. This person needs to learn about consent and that they can\u2019t just invade others personal space or refuse to take no for an answer. The school staff are the AH here - it\u2019s clear you were uncomfortable and they\u2019ve left you to stay in a difficult and uncomfortable situation rather than deal with it themselves.", "NTA. You are allowed to set boundaries with ANYONE.

You don't have to feel uncomfortable for someone else.", "NTA.\n\nYou have the right to your physical boundaries, and you don't owe him anything. His special needs don't entitle him to special privileges.", "NTA\n\nIn middle school my locker was by a special ed room. The amount of times I was groped, ass grabbed, slammed into my locker, etc by 2 of the boys going back to the room after lunch is astronomical. Many, many times at least one of the teachers had to have witnessed it but would actually look in the other direction was as to not see it. Every single second of what happened was unacceptable. I wish now I had told my mom what was happening, especially the time she asked about a bruise I had gotten from him smashing me against my locker. \n\nPLEASE PLEASE PLEASE let a teacher know & if they don't do anything about it, go to the principal or even higher. Hopefully your parents have your back.", "Nta he needs to understand it's not ok to hug without permission", "NAH: You have the right to your own personal space, and to determine who and how anyone touches you. You weren't trying to be rude or to embarrass him either.", "[removed]", "I mean, at this point she absolutely can be mean about it. He has continued and no one has bothered to correct his behavior. If she yelled at him and really scared him it might make him stop", "Yep, it's a lot better for his feelings to get hurt in a supervised environment than for someone to mace him or call the cops on him once he's out on his own.", "Wow, what an ugly and categorically incorrect opinion. If you truly believe in karma, you should be worried for yourself.", "1st. OP is not wrong for not wanting to be touched repeatedly without her consent. \n\n2nd. How reprehensible of you to view being born special needs as some kind of punishment. \n\n3rd. You\u2019re vile.", "NTA. It's not OK for him to go round hugging people who don't want to be hugged. You did absolutely the right thing by responding in a way that showed your discomfort and the teacher did the right thing telling him not to hug people.", "You should never feel forced to do physical contact no matter who the other person is.

And for crying out loud, there's no such thing as a  next life. What a disgusting comment", "This,  he's gonna end up getting punched one day.  Or if he grabs a child.

Do not accept physical touch you don\u2019t want.", "i apologize, i did not know, thank you for informing me so that i won\u2019t make that mistake again!!! i\u2019d only ever heard of them referred that way at my school (even by the teachers) so i assumed that was the proper name.", "i do try, but he also just passes by me multiple times and i sometimes don\u2019t even see him. i\u2019ve had times in the past actually where he comes up and just starts trying to touch my hand or push me into a corner so i kind of can\u2019t escape lmao and kids who knew of his behavior would tell him to leave me alone but i always kinda thought i should try to be nice still", "love these suggestions , thank you", "Don\u2019t. I understand how it feels wrong but, as a person who worked with special needs and disabled kids, please get an adult involved and send this information in an email to school. I\u2019m not joking that sometimes people with his disabilities don\u2019t take into account consent. At all. If he wants to have something- or someone - he will just go for it and overpower/fight/attack to have it. I am not trying to be mean or have prejudice, I am sadly speaking from experience of many other women in your place. Take it seriously. He can and 100% will escalate if you don\u2019t get adults involved."]}
