{"id": 31942, "submission_id": "1868ixg", "title": "AITA for walking out of Thanksgiving dinner for having to sit at the kid's table", "selftext": "I (24M) walked out in the middle of my dad/step-family's Thanksgiving last week. I was not raised religious, but my father married into an extremely Mormon family when I was about 14. My step-mom isn't actively LDS anymore, but she still is very close with her family. I'm not close to any of them, but I'll still attend family gatherings and act civil because it makes my dad happy. This year, I stormed out in the middle of dinner and nobody has spoken to me since.\n\nThese family gatherings are extremely overwhelming for me. When I say they're extremely Mormon, I mean EXTREMELY Mormon. My step-grandfather was a bishop for many years and already has 6 great-grandkids at the age of 75. Every year it seems like there are 3 or 4 new babies.  All of my cousins married before the age of 20. I have been sitting at the kid's table with said cousins for a while but this year I noticed something different.\n\nI noticed that all the cousins my age got to sit at the adult's table after they returned from their mission or got married. I am the oldest of the cousins but have not been invited. I was stuck sitting with a group of 10-15-year-olds I only saw once a year. I don't do well with kids and was pretty much forced to babysit them. After a few minutes of tolerating baby talk, I went to move my plate to the adult's table, I was told that there wasn't room. I jokingly asked if I needed to get married to sit at the adult table. My step-grandmother then told me that marriage is how women become real adults so usually yes.\n\nThis comment blew me away for a few reasons. Misogyny aside, I came out to them as transgender a few months ago and have been on testosterone to the point where I am obviously not a woman to anyone with eyes. My dad took it poorly at first but has been making an effort to try harder and accept me. It's really hard for both of us but I appreciate that he's trying so I try to meet him halfway (ie going to Thanksgiving). The Mormon family has taken it extremely poorly. They have made no effort to learn more about me and respect who I am. They've never liked that I'm the opposite of a good LDS girl. They photoshop all my piercings and tattoos out of family photos. They used to be polite to me, but this comment from step-grandma was extremely intentional and pointed. I put my plate in the sink and left without saying a word.\n\nI called my dad later in the evening to apologize for leaving without saying goodbye and he declined my call. I tried again and he declined it again. I have not heard from anyone in the family since Thursday. AITA?\n\nEDIT: It was extremely obvious when I left. I wasn't exactly subtle when...closing...doors and leaving my plate.\n\n&#x200B;", "created_utc": 1701209777, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1868ixg/aita_for_walking_out_of_thanksgiving_dinner_for/", "score": 337, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I am sorry this is the family you have. It's funny how really nasty these \"moral\" religious folks are. Goes to show that morality, human dignity, kindness, and respect aren't really religious traits as much as they like to claim them. I bet you anything you display more respect and tolerance for their views than they ever will for yours.", "NTA.\n\nI'm so sorry. Your family has made it clear that they don't respect who you are. I think it's perfectly reasonable for you to get up and go. Perhaps your departure wasn't as polite as it could have been, but given the provocation, I think you are fine.\n\nThere is no reason to torture yourself being with people who don't approve of you. I wish you the best of luck in finding a \"logical family\" to replace your \"biological family\".", "NTA your dad should be the one calling you. \n\nYou are his child and his responsibility and he let you down. And until he makes the effort, I wouldn\u2019t even bother.", "NTA I wouldn\u2019t even try with these people, they don\u2019t accept you unless you fit into their shallow ideals and you don\u2019t need to be hurt by them any longer. It doesn\u2019t sound like your dad is meeting you half way. You\u2019ll make your own family, one based on love and acceptance.", "NTA\n\nyou really do not need this in your life. They are being very disrespectful. Regardless of your life choices, you deserve to be treated as an adult.\n\nYou do not need them in your life. if they want to apologise, let them come to you.", "NTA. My dad was Mormon for a bit when I was in high school. The missionaries were constantly picking at me for being grunge/goth/metalhead, continuing to go to my own Baptist church, refusing to participate in family nights, etc. I ran into them one time after school (was going to the library, then my church for teen Bible study). They started making it a point to be there from that point on. I had to change my routine for that day. One time they were at my house, and our bathroom downstairs was in need of attention, so Dad told them to use the upstairs one. This fucker comes downstairs and says he'd like to replace my metal CDs with the Mormon Tabernacle Choir. I lost my shit. Following me after school was one thing, going into a teenage girl's bedroom without permission to poke through her things was quite another. I told my dad that under no circumstance was I going to tolerate being forced to deal with these people any more. He could just have a backbone and tell them he wasn't going to force me. They finally stopped when the elders took the coffee pot and coffee from the house while I was at work. I called them and threatened them with a curse. They never bothered me again after that, and a few months later, we left the state, and Dad left the church. My MIL was a SLC Mormon who had stopped attending when my ex-husband was a child, and told me I could have complained to the bishop, but they were condoning the harassment. After my horrid experience with the LDS, I can easily sympathize with other young people having trouble with them, especially those who don't fit the ideal picture of perfect Mormon standards. Your stepmom's family just gave you your out. When your dad finally reaches out, tell him you are more than willing to have a relationship with him and possibly stepmom (I haven't seen any mention on her stance regarding your transition), but you will have nothing to do with the others. If you haven't already, look into LGBT+ support groups in your area. And there are plenty of us who are willing to be the parental figure you deserve. Good luck, OP.", "Leave. It\u2019s a cult.", "NTA!! Good for you for leaving! You should never have to endure disrespect and belittlement for the sake of someone else and I'm so sorry your dad isn't stepping up to defend you, that's truly awful.", "NTA, not one bit.  Considering how TBM (true believing Mormon) this family is, they will likely never accept you.  I'm a little surprised that your father and stepmother are not standing up for you at all with the comments and the airbrushing, but you should probably not consider them a good support system in the future.\n\nIs there much family on your father's side that you can spend time with?", "INFO: why do you want to be part of a family that won\u2019t accept you for who you are? You deserve much more than these religious fanatics. \n\nNTA btw.", "Stop agonizing over this. In NO way is this your fault. Sounds like you have a very bigoted family and you may find more peace if you just go low to no contact.", "NTA, this is not your tribe my dude.  \nYou will find your people, unfortunately it sounds like they won't be in your father's family. Extreme religious people and LGBTQ+ people are not natural allies, and sadly sometimes the people who are supposed to love you the most will let you down using their religion to hide behind, when they are just nasty bigots. I have been cut off from the religious faction of my family too. Apparently my relationship with another woman made me an \"abomination\".   \nBest of luck on your journey. I hope it goes smoothly for you.", "NTA.\n\nThey suck, obviously. LDS is a cult and you shouldn't have to tolerate being around them.\n\nAlthough, if you already agreed to go to dinner, you could have just waited out the evening and then told you father that you don't want to see these people ever again. For the sake of your relationship with your dad.", "NTA I was born and raised in an LDS family. No true Christian would treat you that way.", "NTA.\n\nThis is random, but today I was watching a YT video on parental \"archetypes\" (could be grandparent, step-parent, etc) and there was one called the \"Method Actor.\" It's someone who throws themself into a role, mostly for appearances. Very religious parents usually fall into this category. There's usually a lot of hypocrisy, and playing a part of being a \"perfect\" person according to that religion to make yourself look good. No one is really authentic with each other.\n\nI don't know if this applies to your family, but when you talked about having your piercings, etc, being photoshopped out, it really reminded me of that video. \"Let's pretend we're this type of family.\" Everyone has to play a particular role and is never truly themselves.\n\nI would rather be myself.\n\nEdit: clarity", "NTA in the slightest.  They're the weirdos with a terrible history. Start spending your holidays with people that respect you.", "NTA. How completely disrespectful. My BFF is LDS and I love her despite it. She's gotten very deep in her faith but not disrespect people for who they are and/or who they love deep because that would be the sad end to our friendship. I feel gross every time I see a missionary with a plastered on smile talking about the glory of conformance. Ew.", "Tbh, if I had been in your situation I'd have said something along the lines of \"Well, if I'm not an adult yet, you will excuse me for doing something as imature as this...\" and then proceed to smack my food in their face.\n\nNTA.", "My ex's family was LDS, but they lived according to Jesus' teachings. Treated everyone with basic respect, it's not their place to judge anyone. They were all pretty liberal. These people are just assholes. Blood doesn't make you family, love does. You deserve to be cared for and seen for who you are. I hope you find your chosen family.", "YTA\n\nThere are ways to politely challenge or leave situations like that, but you wanted to send a message.  You did.", "NTA I\u2019d done more than put my plate in the sink. A lot more.", "NTA  They were extremely rude and bigoted.  Don't go to any of your father's family gatherings anymore. Do you have family on your mom's side that you can spend holidays with? If not, time to start celebrating Friendsgiving.", "NTA, but, that got a little confusing for a minute - might be worth putting the trans point a little higher in the post \ud83d\ude05\n\nSeriously, NTA, though. It sounds like you're better off away from them, and like your dad is now using it as an excuse to let his bigotry re: your transition go full tilt. Or, he's decided they're more important to him, which is just as bad.", "NTA. It sounds like you made a scene and maybe you could have have had a quieter exit. But they were being ridiculous. Regardless of you sexual orientation, it is beyond offensive to put an adult at the kids table because they aren\u2019t married. Good for you for not tolerating it.", "NTA, I\u2019d stop trying with them. They will not accept you, father included. It\u2019s painful as hell, but long term you\u2019ll be much happier making a chosen family of people who love you for you.", "Dude. You messed up!\n\nYou could have radicalized those preteens while the \u201cadults\u201d were busy. Get them excited about tattoos and body piercings while the grownups discuss biblical purity and how to best press their khakis. Destroy the next generation while the old coots congregate themselves on ruling the universe!!", "Sometimes people need a break, you do for a while and so does your dad.  He needs to think about his loyalty to his child, gender aside, you are his child and if he can\u2019t accept you for who you are then perhaps he doesn\u2019t need to be so much a part of your life.  The other thing is to not go around any of those people ever again.  They are not worth the dirt on the bottom of your shoe.", "NTA. You have nothing to apologize for so I would stop trying to chase your dad. If he was any kind of real parent, he would support you without question and he would not tolerate anyone mistreating you. \n\nI would never ever hang around an intolerant cult anyway, but I would suggest that be the last time you see any of them.", "NTA. I am sorry this happened to you.  Don't feel obligated to attend next year.  Start planning now to host Thanksgiving for the family you find.  You don't have to serve a traditional menu.  I have a friend who just cooked Mexican food for eight people in his basement apartment in Taiwan where he's an artist in residence.  Everyone had a wonderful time.", "you would be a fool to continue any contact with these cult members. NTA", "You chose to be trans. They chose to follow a Relegion in which trans is not acceptable. Both of you made your choices. Cut them off and let them be who they are in peace. Don\u2019t try and shove the fact that you believe being trans is okay down their throat.", "Nta\n\nCults are going to cult, it's what they do. You don't need to talk to them again, but call/ text/ email/ just straight up show up where you dad is sometime, and tell him that he risks losing his child from his life if his wife's family keeps disrespecting you and he does nothing.", "NTA. But I think you should make up with your family. Then at the next gathering when they sit you at the kids table, you can tell the kids the truth about the mormon religion and how it was created to justify polygamy.", "NTA. next year do yourself a favor and don't even go.", "NTA!  Absolutely not.  Thanksgiving is supposed to be a time when people come together.  These people are ugly in spirit.\n\nShame on your father and stepmom (since it's her family) for not standing up for you.  They owe YOU apologies!\n\nIf you are not particularly interested in knowing your stepmom's family (and it doesn't look like you are), I think it's fine to never interact with them.  If your father tries to give you grief about it, remind him of this Thanksgiving incident (and how he''s a fat coward); why would you subject yourself to more?  Any sane person would not.", "The only thing you did that was suboptimal was trying to apologize to people who didn't deserve an apology. \n\nNTA", "You could have just taken your plate and drink, gone into the living room and turned on a football game.", "How come 11 days ago you were 26 and female?", "NTA for leaving. The slamming may have been warranted but doesn't help you or them. \n\nYou sound like you're tying your actions to the severity of their response. Really really, you'd be best to disentangle those two things. You already know that you see reality differently than the rest of your family does. So, you've got to understand that they'll see everything you do in a different light than you do. There'll be places where they're essentially the same, but you can't count on that. \n\nThat's relevant here in that you've got to decide whether you are happy with your actions without much (if any) reference to their reactions. You can't live your life trying to satisfy people who see life as differently as you vs the rest of that family do. You'll never satisfy them and you'll never be happy with yourself. \n\nKnow where your line is. Go and be involved up to your line, if it looks like that's possible. You know they see you as a misguided child who is acting out. If you can tolerate what that entails, go. If not, don't. \n\nI suggest that it's not worth burning bridges (or slamming doors) because that'll just be reinforcing their image of you as a child acting out & misbehaving. The more mature and bored you are with their antics, the better. Definitely lay into them if it's cathartic for you, just don't expect any positive results - they have enough of a system reinforcing their beliefs that it's unlikely you could even really dent them.", "Yeah, 10-15 year olds don't talk baby talk, and your reaction here makes you sound that age.\n\nIf you want to leave because your family are jerks, fine.  But if you're \"storming out\" because of who you sat with?  Ppffft. ESH", "NTA  \n\n\nGive your dad a few more days- he's in love with the family's daughter and has to navigate her response (and her family's response to both her and your dad) since they're married.   \n\n\nGiven his acceptance of you and love for you as his son, it should only be a matter of time. It sounds like he's important to you which means you should give him time and space to figure out how to proceed and explain to you how he's feeling. Don't write him off, instead, get ready to hear what he's been going through.   \n\n\nYou two can go from there with or without the step-mom & definitely without her batshit family. Good luck!", "I'm a little torn here and I don't want to judge.\n\nBut from your dad's perspective you could have done him the courtesy of telling him you were leaving and why.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

They would obviously prefer you not attend and it may be best that way if he is unwilling to stand up to them for you. But don't get snippy with that last bit, make it clear you don't blame him since his family dynamics make that very hard, but going there is not tolerable anymore for anyone.\n\nJust my two cents.", "Don\u2019t know why you\u2019d subject yourself to that. You knew there\u2019d be issues from someone, or something amiss. Do yourself a huge favor. Create yourself a new, loving family and blow off the cult.", "NTA and I\u2019m sorry this is the family you have. I\u2019m especially sorry your dad is withdrawing; that\u2019s really hurtful. Personally, if I had to have a meal with these people, I would only sit with the kids because the adults sound awful.", "NTA.\n\nI will not pass judgment on LDS as a whole because we all know enough. I am not even going to say anything about how they can\u2019t even practice the love they demand from you. I am going to focus on something else. \n\nYou are a fully actualized adult. Forgetting that ridiculously stupid jab, you attended a family function. You were sat with children who were a decade + younger than you. You were denied participation with the adults *as an adult*. \n\nWhatever choices you have made, whoever you are, no matter what you believe, the fact is you\u2019re *an adult.* They are forcing you to be at the kids table to punish you for whatever stupid reasons they think they have during a holiday gathering. \n\nThese are *not* your people. They are not worthy of you. They are small minded, cruel, bitter humans who want you to be equally small minded, cruel and bitter so you can \u201cgraduate\u201d to being considered one of them. I would never want to be considered one of them, personally. \n\nMan, I\u2019d love to invite you to our gatherings. There are a ton of us, we just keep making the table bigger and bigger, longer and longer, jamming as many chairs as we can fit. As soon as you\u2019re old enough to sit up on your own, you get a high chair at the table. No separate tables. We all sit, we all talk, we all argue, we debate, we decide we despise each other and will never speak again and the fury lasts for the remainder of the five seconds it takes for a new debate to form. We argue (HARD) for who gets the last piece of pie, we act stupid and silly and we\u2019re loud. \n\nWe\u2019re here, we\u2019re proud and we love each other, and it doesn\u2019t matter what anyone did, it doesn\u2019t matter at all. Maybe for that five seconds, but never forever. We are adults that act like children, we have children acting like adults. We have everyone chewing and having a good time. \n\nFind that family for yourself. You deserve so much more than these people have the capability to offer you. \n\nYou have spent 24 years being *wrong* in some way. Piercings, hair color, everything. They are willing to accept you as long as they can photoshop you to be their version of you. They don\u2019t want you as you are, they want you how they want you. Please, OP, love yourself enough to know that this is not love. They are ugly people, and you have spent far too long trying to fit into the stupid box they want you to fit to avoid making waves. The best way to avoid making waves is to avoid the ocean entirely - and the water they offer is shark infested anyway. \n\nIt\u2019s time. It\u2019s scary, but it\u2019s time. Go make a life and a family worthy of you. A holiday tradition that makes you happy. These people aren\u2019t any of that. \n\nGood luck OP, and I\u2019m rooting for you!", "You are welcome to come to my house next year.", "NTA - I don't want to assume i know anything about someone's religion but isn't it not common for LDS families to distance themselves from relatives who don't conform?  If your relative had been an acting Bishop (during an even less tolerant time period)  could he not be putting his foot down and forcing others to do the same or suffer standing with the church?  \n\nLDS folks, please correct me (if you have the time and willingness) if I am wrong here.  I'd rather learn than be wrong.\n\nSpeaking of wrong...You are not wrong to leave.  I would have.  You tried.  That was a lot more than your great grand did.  I'm so sorry.  Know that you have some random internet support here and I hope for the best for you.", "Yes, you're TA. This was very childish. I don't agree with their beliefs either but you knew these things when you showed up. What in the world did you expect? Now your feelings are hurt for not being to sit at another table and for the grandmother to be exactly who she is(which you already knew).. Then...closed doors? Or slammed them as you left? I'm sorry they can't accept you for who you are, I'm sure that's hurtful but your expectations for this gathering were delusional. Stay away from them!", "NTA\n\nSorry. You really should hear that from your dad. You were blantantly disrespected plain and simple. They are wrong. Don't let their treatment of you affect your value in any way. They are wrong.", "NTA. They are all assholes but especially your dad.", "NTA. These people are a lost cause. They will never accept *anyone* who isn\u2019t a mirror of themselves. It sounds like your dad \u201cgoes along to get along\u201d. Don\u2019t take this personally, embrace your uniqueness, and continue on.", "I\u2019m so sorry you had to experience this kind of behavior. Who cares about the Mormons, but your dad owes you more. I don\u2019t know him, but as a father I have higher expectations. He let you down. Hoping he comes around but until then, take this from me. {{hug}}", "That's Dum Dum Dum Dum Dumb and I'm sorry you have to deal with it.", "NTA \n\nText dad one last time to apologize just so that it\u2019s been said and then forget about it. \n\nThey are rigid and dismissive and it will not change. It\u2019s a cult. You either belong or you aren\u2019t welcome. You were tolerated before your transition but now you are going to be iced out - case in point the kids table. You can start arranging to meet your dad alone from time to time if you want to or you can just let it run it\u2019s course.", "NTA. If I were you I wouldn\u2019t go back. Take the holidays back for yourself to enjoy! Sounds like you\u2019d be better off without these judgmental pricks", "Info: how far away from the sink were you when you placed your plate in it?", "NTA, this proves they don't consider you a man. Maybe you should try to find your chosen family. Some people aren't close to their biological family. My family is one of those families, for example", "NTA im sorry they did this to you. There are so many levels of them being A\u2019s here. I hope you find nicer people to celebrate thanksgiving with next year.\n \nAlso I\u2019d stop trying to call your dad and apologise because by being silent he is condoning their treatment of you. Let him call you when he pulls his head out of his butt. He chose to marry into this family it wasn\u2019t your choice and it\u2019s in no way ok that he accepts their treatment of you", " NTA. That comment is insane. I will say that I empathize like no other as I\u2019m in my 30s and the only adult stuck at the kids table because I\u2019m not married. The reasoning is \u201ccouples get priority\u201d. The kids range 8-18 while everyone else is 30+. \n\nI don\u2019t think single people ever escape the kids table, no matter how religious it is. \ud83d\ude2d", "Definitely. What stepfamily did Is NOT what Jesus would do.", "There\u2019s no hate like  Christian \u201clove.\u201d", "This is a cult and I would not consider these people as actually religious. It was not that long ago that the mormans believed that black skin was the mark of Cain.", "I know this isn\u2019t what you meant, but now I\u2019m imagining OP finding a nice Vulcan family to marry into.", "100%. Apologies to OP for being blunt but sometimes the garbage takes itself out.", "There cannot be enough upvotes for this comment. You don't owe those people a thing. They are not good enough for you. Period. Your dad is a self-actualized adult. If he chooses to side with people that don't consider you to be a) a man and b) an adult, then he can fuck right off with them.\n\nYou deserve to be surrounded by people that cherish you and provide love, acceptance, and support. These people ain't it. Make a family worthy of you.", ">I called them and threatened them with a curse. \n\nReaders, take note! You may not know how to inflict a curse, but the \"pious\" people you threaten believe you do.", "So, you're saying OP should have been OK with the ongoing disrespect and lack of support from their dad for the sake of the relationship with their dad. Nope. This is backwards. The father should have supported his son for the sake of their relationship.\nNo one should continue to endure disrespect and abuse for that reason.", "Ugh this made me physically ill to read OP\u2019s experience. But what\u2019s worse is that parents - ESP Dad - didn\u2019t step in or say ANYthing! That\u2019s cowardly! No nice way to put it. \n\nMy Godson came to me to tell me he was bi or possibly gay - wasn\u2019t fully sure yet and needed someone to talk to. He said he wasn\u2019t sure how I\u2019d feel but he knows I love him and it would\nPrepare him for talking to his parents if I gave him pushback based on us being Christian. He was shocked when I said, \u201cYou are God\u2019s unique creation and work of art\u2026 and you\u2019re right - I love you. All of that said, I wouldn\u2019t worry about having to decide if you\u2019re gay or bi - you owe no one a label. Be YOU, you\u2019re 15 and you\u2019ll figure that out in time. And wherever that lands, I love you.\u201d (His primary worry was \u201cwhat to tell people because I don\u2019t want to say I\u2019m bi and then realize I\u2019m gay and have people thinking I was trying to baby step into it\u2026\u201d so that\u2019s why I didn\u2019t want him to feel the pressure of owing anyone a particular label.)\n\nI just don\u2019t understand how you can claim to love someone unconditionally and then something comes up that somehow makes that love conditional? Last I checked that\u2019s not how Jesus works\u2026", "OP has been more mature than any of them have been to him!", "A 24 year old being seated at the kids table is an intentionally disrespectful choice. It was meant to be insulting. \n\nOp didn't need to go there just to be insulted.", "They left because of the step grandmas horrible comment NTA", "Did you miss all the transphobia and misogyny?", "Hear, hear! \ud83d\udc4f", "YUP!!!!!!! My dad\u2019s Christian GF sent me an email about why Muslims are bad Americans. WTF. This is just one example of years of bigotry and interacting like a child. Don\u2019t let terrible people make you feel bad! I cut that awful woman off. She\u2019s been trying for a couple years to get back in my good graces since I pay for shit. ANYWAY. NTA!", "While I definitely agree with your sentiment having grown up in a conservative southern church, Mormons are only nominally Christian. If you actually dig into their beliefs you'd see that they're wildly non-biblical and straight up blasphemous in some cases.", "My Spock family!", "I'm pretty sure if I wanted to risk ending up on their radar again, I could find out if I was still blacklisted. But even after marrying the son of a former Mormon, I haven't had a knock on my door from them in over twenty years!", "Can confirm. Went to middle school in a highly, *highly* conservative Christian area and had trouble with adults deciding I was a witch and \"offering\" to \"help\" my mother \"fix \\[my\\] connection to Satan.\" How did they come to the conclusion that I was a witch?\n\nBecause I, a preteen/early teen girl, had no qualms about making eye contact with adults. That's it. (I never learned what Mom said or did to make the adults back off, but I had Hell from my fellow students until we moved.)"]}
