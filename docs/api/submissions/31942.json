{"id": 31942, "submission_id": "1868ixg", "title": "AITA for walking out of Thanksgiving dinner for having to sit at the kid's table", "selftext": "I (24M) walked out in the middle of my dad/step-family's Thanksgiving last week. I was not raised religious, but my father married into an extremely Mormon family when I was about 14. My step-mom isn't actively LDS anymore, but she still is very close with her family. I'm not close to any of them, but I'll still attend family gatherings and act civil because it makes my dad happy. This year, I stormed out in the middle of dinner and nobody has spoken to me since.\n\nThese family gatherings are extremely overwhelming for me. When I say they're extremely Mormon, I mean EXTREMELY Mormon. My step-grandfather was a bishop for many years and already has 6 great-grandkids at the age of 75. Every year it seems like there are 3 or 4 new babies.  All of my cousins married before the age of 20. I have been sitting at the kid's table with said cousins for a while but this year I noticed something different.\n\nI noticed that all the cousins my age got to sit at the adult's table after they returned from their mission or got married. I am the oldest of the cousins but have not been invited. I was stuck sitting with a group of 10-15-year-olds I only saw once a year. I don't do well with kids and was pretty much forced to babysit them. After a few minutes of tolerating baby talk, I went to move my plate to the adult's table, I was told that there wasn't room. I jokingly asked if I needed to get married to sit at the adult table. My step-grandmother then told me that marriage is how women become real adults so usually yes.\n\nThis comment blew me away for a few reasons. Misogyny aside, I came out to them as transgender a few months ago and have been on testosterone to the point where I am obviously not a woman to anyone with eyes. My dad took it poorly at first but has been making an effort to try harder and accept me. It's really hard for both of us but I appreciate that he's trying so I try to meet him halfway (ie going to Thanksgiving). The Mormon family has taken it extremely poorly. They have made no effort to learn more about me and respect who I am. They've never liked that I'm the opposite of a good LDS girl. They photoshop all my piercings and tattoos out of family photos. They used to be polite to me, but this comment from step-grandma was extremely intentional and pointed. I put my plate in the sink and left without saying a word.\n\nI called my dad later in the evening to apologize for leaving without saying goodbye and he declined my call. I tried again and he declined it again. I have not heard from anyone in the family since Thursday. AITA?\n\nEDIT: It was extremely obvious when I left. I wasn't exactly subtle when...closing...doors and leaving my plate.\n\n&#x200B;", "created_utc": 1701209777, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1868ixg/aita_for_walking_out_of_thanksgiving_dinner_for/", "score": 1865, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I am sorry this is the family you have. It's funny how really nasty these \"moral\" religious folks are.

I bet you anything you display more respect and tolerance for their views than they ever will for yours.", "NTA.\n\nI'm so sorry. Your family has made it clear that they don't respect who you are. I think it's perfectly reasonable for you to get up and go. Perhaps your departure wasn't as polite as it could have been, but given the provocation, I think you are fine.\n\nThere is no reason to torture yourself being with people who don't approve of you. I wish you the best of luck in finding a \"logical family\" to replace your \"biological family\".", "NTA your dad should be the one calling you. \n\nYou are his child and his responsibility and he let you down. And until he makes the effort, I wouldn\u2019t even bother.", "NTA I wouldn\u2019t even try with these people, they don\u2019t accept you unless you fit into their shallow ideals and you don\u2019t need to be hurt by them any longer. It doesn\u2019t sound like your dad is meeting you half way. You\u2019ll make your own family, one based on love and acceptance.", "NTA\n\nyou really do not need this in your life. They are being very disrespectful. Regardless of your life choices, you deserve to be treated as an adult.\n\nYou do not need them in your life. if they want to apologise, let them come to you.", "NTA. My dad was Mormon for a bit when I was in high school. The missionaries were constantly picking at me for being grunge/goth/metalhead, continuing to go to my own Baptist church, refusing to participate in family nights, etc. I ran into them one time after school (was going to the library, then my church for teen Bible study). They started making it a point to be there from that point on. I had to change my routine for that day. One time they were at my house, and our bathroom downstairs was in need of attention, so Dad told them to use the upstairs one. This fucker comes downstairs and says he'd like to replace my metal CDs with the Mormon Tabernacle Choir. I lost my shit. Following me after school was one thing, going into a teenage girl's bedroom without permission to poke through her things was quite another. I told my dad that under no circumstance was I going to tolerate being forced to deal with these people any more. He could just have a backbone and tell them he wasn't going to force me. They finally stopped when the elders took the coffee pot and coffee from the house while I was at work. I called them and threatened them with a curse. They never bothered me again after that, and a few months later, we left the state, and Dad left the church. My MIL was a SLC Mormon who had stopped attending when my ex-husband was a child, and told me I could have complained to the bishop, but they were condoning the harassment. After my horrid experience with the LDS, I can easily sympathize with other young people having trouble with them, especially those who don't fit the ideal picture of perfect Mormon standards. Your stepmom's family just gave you your out. When your dad finally reaches out, tell him you are more than willing to have a relationship with him and possibly stepmom (I haven't seen any mention on her stance regarding your transition), but you will have nothing to do with the others. If you haven't already, look into LGBT+ support groups in your area. And there are plenty of us who are willing to be the parental figure you deserve. Good luck, OP.", "Leave. It\u2019s a cult.", "NTA!! Good for you for leaving! You should never have to endure disrespect and belittlement for the sake of someone else and I'm so sorry your dad isn't stepping up to defend you, that's truly awful.", "NTA, not one bit.  Considering how TBM (true believing Mormon) this family is, they will likely never accept you.  I'm a little surprised that your father and stepmother are not standing up for you at all with the comments and the airbrushing, but you should probably not consider them a good support system in the future.\n\nIs there much family on your father's side that you can spend time with?", "INFO: why do you want to be part of a family that won\u2019t accept you for who you are? You deserve much more than these religious fanatics. \n\nNTA btw.", "Stop agonizing over this. In NO way is this your fault. Sounds like you have a very bigoted family and you may find more peace if you just go low to no contact.", "NTA, this is not your tribe my dude.  \nYou will find your people, unfortunately it sounds like they won't be in your father's family. Extreme religious people and LGBTQ+ people are not natural allies, and sadly sometimes the people who are supposed to love you the most will let you down using their religion to hide behind, when they are just nasty bigots. I have been cut off from the religious faction of my family too. Apparently my relationship with another woman made me an \"abomination\".   \nBest of luck on your journey. I hope it goes smoothly for you.", "NTA.\n\nThey suck, obviously. LDS is a cult and you shouldn't have to tolerate being around them.\n\nAlthough, if you already agreed to go to dinner, you could have just waited out the evening and then told you father that you don't want to see these people ever again. For the sake of your relationship with your dad.", "NTA I was born and raised in an LDS family. No true Christian would treat you that way.", "NTA.\n\nThis is random, but today I was watching a YT video on parental \"archetypes\" (could be grandparent, step-parent, etc) and there was one called the \"Method Actor.\" It's someone who throws themself into a role, mostly for appearances. Very religious parents usually fall into this category. There's usually a lot of hypocrisy, and playing a part of being a \"perfect\" person according to that religion to make yourself look good. No one is really authentic with each other.\n\nI don't know if this applies to your family, but when you talked about having your piercings, etc, being photoshopped out, it really reminded me of that video. \"Let's pretend we're this type of family.\" Everyone has to play a particular role and is never truly themselves.\n\nI would rather be myself.\n\nEdit: clarity", "NTA in the slightest.  They're the weirdos with a terrible history. Start spending your holidays with people that respect you.", "NTA. How completely disrespectful. My BFF is LDS and I love her despite it. She's gotten very deep in her faith but not disrespect people for who they are and/or who they love deep because that would be the sad end to our friendship. I feel gross every time I see a missionary with a plastered on smile talking about the glory of conformance. Ew.", "Tbh, if I had been in your situation I'd have said something along the lines of \"Well, if I'm not an adult yet, you will excuse me for doing something as imature as this...\" and then proceed to smack my food in their face.\n\nNTA.", "My ex's family was LDS, but they lived according to Jesus' teachings. Treated everyone with basic respect, it's not their place to judge anyone. They were all pretty liberal. These people are just assholes. Blood doesn't make you family, love does. You deserve to be cared for and seen for who you are. I hope you find your chosen family.", "YTA\n\nThere are ways to politely challenge or leave situations like that, but you wanted to send a message.  You did.", "NTA I\u2019d done more than put my plate in the sink. A lot more.", "NTA  They were extremely rude and bigoted.  Don't go to any of your father's family gatherings anymore. Do you have family on your mom's side that you can spend holidays with? If not, time to start celebrating Friendsgiving.", "NTA, but, that got a little confusing for a minute - might be worth putting the trans point a little higher in the post \ud83d\ude05\n\nSeriously, NTA, though. It sounds like you're better off away from them, and like your dad is now using it as an excuse to let his bigotry re: your transition go full tilt. Or, he's decided they're more important to him, which is just as bad.", "NTA. It sounds like you made a scene and maybe you could have have had a quieter exit. But they were being ridiculous. Regardless of you sexual orientation, it is beyond offensive to put an adult at the kids table because they aren\u2019t married. Good for you for not tolerating it.", "NTA, I\u2019d stop trying with them. They will not accept you, father included. It\u2019s painful as hell, but long term you\u2019ll be much happier making a chosen family of people who love you for you.", "Dude. You messed up!\n\nYou could have radicalized those preteens while the \u201cadults\u201d were busy. Get them excited about tattoos and body piercings while the grownups discuss biblical purity and how to best press their khakis. Destroy the next generation while the old coots congratulate themselves on ruling the universe!!\n\nEdit: words", "Sometimes people need a break, you do for a while and so does your dad.  He needs to think about his loyalty to his child, gender aside, you are his child and if he can\u2019t accept you for who you are then perhaps he doesn\u2019t need to be so much a part of your life.  The other thing is to not go around any of those people ever again.  They are not worth the dirt on the bottom of your shoe.", "NTA. You have nothing to apologize for so I would stop trying to chase your dad. If he was any kind of real parent, he would support you without question and he would not tolerate anyone mistreating you. \n\nI would never ever hang around an intolerant cult anyway, but I would suggest that be the last time you see any of them.", "NTA. I am sorry this happened to you.  Don't feel obligated to attend next year.  Start planning now to host Thanksgiving for the family you find.  You don't have to serve a traditional menu.  I have a friend who just cooked Mexican food for eight people in his basement apartment in Taiwan where he's an artist in residence.  Everyone had a wonderful time.", "you would be a fool to continue any contact with these cult members. NTA", "You chose to be trans. They chose to follow a Relegion in which trans is not acceptable. Both of you made your choices. Cut them off and let them be who they are in peace. Don\u2019t try and shove the fact that you believe being trans is okay down their throat.", "Nta\n\nCults are going to cult, it's what they do. You don't need to talk to them again, but call/ text/ email/ just straight up show up where you dad is sometime, and tell him that he risks losing his child from his life if his wife's family keeps disrespecting you and he does nothing.", "NTA. But I think you should make up with your family. Then at the next gathering when they sit you at the kids table, you can tell the kids the truth about the mormon religion and how it was created to justify polygamy.", "NTA. next year do yourself a favor and don't even go.", "NTA!  Absolutely not.  Thanksgiving is supposed to be a time when people come together.  These people are ugly in spirit.\n\nShame on your father and stepmom (since it's her family) for not standing up for you.  They owe YOU apologies!\n\nIf you are not particularly interested in knowing your stepmom's family (and it doesn't look like you are), I think it's fine to never interact with them.  If your father tries to give you grief about it, remind him of this Thanksgiving incident (and how he''s a fat coward); why would you subject yourself to more?  Any sane person would not.", "The only thing you did that was suboptimal was trying to apologize to people who didn't deserve an apology. \n\nNTA", "You could have just taken your plate and drink, gone into the living room and turned on a football game.", "How come 11 days ago you were 26 and female?", "NTA for leaving. The slamming may have been warranted but doesn't help you or them. \n\nYou sound like you're tying your actions to the severity of their response. Really really, you'd be best to disentangle those two things. You already know that you see reality differently than the rest of your family does. So, you've got to understand that they'll see everything you do in a different light than you do. There'll be places where they're essentially the same, but you can't count on that. \n\nThat's relevant here in that you've got to decide whether you are happy with your actions without much (if any) reference to their reactions. You can't live your life trying to satisfy people who see life as differently as you vs the rest of that family do. You'll never satisfy them and you'll never be happy with yourself. \n\nKnow where your line is. Go and be involved up to your line, if it looks like that's possible. You know they see you as a misguided child who is acting out. If you can tolerate what that entails, go. If not, don't. \n\nI suggest that it's not worth burning bridges (or slamming doors) because that'll just be reinforcing their image of you as a child acting out & misbehaving. The more mature and bored you are with their antics, the better. Definitely lay into them if it's cathartic for you, just don't expect any positive results - they have enough of a system reinforcing their beliefs that it's unlikely you could even really dent them.", "Yeah, 10-15 year olds don't talk baby talk, and your reaction here makes you sound that age.\n\nIf you want to leave because your family are jerks, fine.  But if you're \"storming out\" because of who you sat with?  Ppffft. ESH", "NTA  \n\n\nGive your dad a few more days- he's in love with the family's daughter and has to navigate her response (and her family's response to both her and your dad) since they're married.   \n\n\nGiven his acceptance of you and love for you as his son, it should only be a matter of time. It sounds like he's important to you which means you should give him time and space to figure out how to proceed and explain to you how he's feeling. Don't write him off, instead, get ready to hear what he's been going through.   \n\n\nYou two can go from there with or without the step-mom & definitely without her batshit family. Good luck!", "I'm a little torn here and I don't want to judge.\n\nBut from your dad's perspective you could have done him the courtesy of telling him you were leaving and why.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

As the years have gone on so too have the president's of the church and let's face it they are all on deaths door when elected. I think this is due to the fact that the people believe they will be old fashioned and not accept the way things are progressing in the world.\n\nWhen the last 2 president's were elected they added a bunch of LGBT acceptance things to their doctrine and they made it more friendly because they were losing so many of my generation \"class of 2001\" and even a little before in the 90s to being part of the LGBT community.

And before you say Catholics believe in and worship other Gods... Some Catholics pray to Saints. Saints aren't Gods, they're people who once lived on Earth who they believe have done something to deserve a guaranteed place in Heaven. They don't pray to them as they would pray to God or worship God, they ask these saints to intervene with God on their behalf. That's different than believing that literal other Gods exist.

It claimed the Mormon prophet, Joseph Smith, saw a lizard that turned into an angel and led to the \"discovery\" of the Book of Mormon.\n\nHofman posed as a rare book dealer, but actually forged rare and historical documents, and then sold them to the highest bidder, often the Mormon Church.\n\nThe Salamander Letter forged by Hofman was supposedly written in 1830 by Martin Harris, the \"scribe\" that Joseph Smith \"dictated\" the Book of Mormon to from the \"golden plates\".\n\nLDS doctrine says that Joseph was \"led\" to the buried treasure (ie \"golden plates\") by an angel. The Salamander Letter, on the other hand, said that Joseph Smith was led to the gold plates by a spirit who \u201ctransfigured himself from a white salamander\u201d!!\n\nThe LDS church purchased and/or were donated the Salamander Letter and many other Hofman forgeries, and made public statements asserting its authenticity.\n\nIn an effort to stop his forgeries from being discovered and avoid paying his financial debts, Hofman constructed 3 pipe bombs. 2  people were killed and another seriously injured when 2 of the pipe bombs went off in Salt Lake City. The next day, Hofman was seriously injured when his 3rd pipe bomb exploded while he was inside his car.\n\nRather than go to trial and risk being sentenced to the death penalty, Hofmann pleaded guilty to two counts of second-degree murder, one count of theft by deception for forging the Salamander Letter, as well as another count of fraud related to Mormon documents. \n\nHofman is currently serving life in prison in Utah.\n\nFor further \"magic LDS lizard\" info check out the documentary series \"Murder Among the Mormons\" on Netflix and the hilarious episode from The Dollop - [https://podcasts.apple.com/ca/podcast/425-hofman-and-the-salamander-live/id643055307?i=1000471509626](https://podcasts.apple.com/ca/podcast/425-hofman-and-the-salamander-live/id643055307?i=1000471509626)", "The planet thing is totally true and it gets worse: the husband gives the wife a secret name.
