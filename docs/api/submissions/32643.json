In no way does my vote on it weigh more or less than yours. Also you mention atheism in this comment but being a heathen in the first one you made to my post, so I'm curious which you are?

And please understand this is simply meant as a question to better understand the direction you are coming from.)", "And the funniest part to me is that the bible itself is full of explicit content... It's hypocrisy at its finest", "heathen is what they call atheists. and what atheist call themselves in some cases like I did. you know why they called them heathens? because they didn't believe in the right god, you know what they called Christians at one point, atheists because they didn't believe in the right god. so because I said that I was a heathen, you would automatically assume Norse pagan? is the context not obvious?\n\nsaid it's not our place to judge, when this is a forum explicitly about judging someone's actions whether they were yta or NTA. so definitely our place to judge", "I think that was the worst part for me. It felt really personal and hypocritical. I was so baffled.", "Pegan was the term used for christians at the start because they didnt believe in the main gods at the time. Atheists are called heathen yes but mostly as a derogatory term. The actual term heathen was used to describe the Germanic people who believed in the norse gods during that conversion period of that area. There are even people of the norse belief who have been reaching out to \"talk heathen\" to have then fox their name (but we both know that wont happen). Either way the end result is that I feel like OP isnt the AH and you feel she is, I feel like that's all there is to it.", "yeah to a certain extent, there is a bit of a discussion to be had, I'm curious as to why people think that she wasn't. it seems like almost everyone on the thread agrees that she was NTA except for myself. I asked a couple of legitimate questions to the op, and they replied with cheers, so I can only assume that they only wanted to hear affirmation, not any type of challenge or push back. they were looking for a pat on the back not an actual discussion or what have you"]}
