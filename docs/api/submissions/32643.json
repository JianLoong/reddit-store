So, am I the unhinged jerk (asshole)?\n\n*Edit to correct typo of Aiport code from \"S\" to \"A\" \n\n\n**UPDATE** \n\nThank you all for taking the time to read and comment. I tried to respond to as many as I could, but there are so many now! I've finally made it home to the PNW after a very long travel day, got some rest,  and still feel unsettled by the situation. \n\nI had to update the post to correct the Aiport code (twice, once to correct the A and another to put the damn letters in the correct order). I'm sorry I confused so many. I can't find the one comment responding to correct the code to SLC for Salt Lake, and it just didn't click with me. So sorry for the confusion there. It was the Atlanta airport, not Salt Lake.\n\nMany people assumed the lady was elderly from the post (likely due to her vocabulary), but she was around my age. Sorry I failed to make that clear!\n\nI accept the YTA judgements as well as the NTA. In truth, despite how many of you fine folks supported my behavior, I recognize that I absolutely was not OK with my reaction and understand why others would not approve. \n\nI posted a few times in comments, but the book in question was **Solstice of the Drowned Empire by Frankie Mallis**. It's part of a series and a great read for anyone who like fantasy series. As far as smuttiness goes, it's not high on that scale (more of a slow burn), but there are graphic scenes. \n\nThere have been no adverse effects from eating the stupid paper. Just bewilderment.\n\nI again appreciate everyone who commented regardless of judgment. I'm going to try to personally respond to as many as I can. \n", "created_utc": 1702096051, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18e5f0h/aita_if_i_ate_and_swallowed_a_message_from_god_on/", "score": 5036, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She is free to believe what she wants to believe but it\u2019s wrong to enforce it on someone else. It is also wrong to say that someone is in the darkness by just looking at them reading a book. It\u2019s crazy how all these religious people think that they are so much better people than us non-religious. Also, according to the message that she believes, you\u2019re not supposed to do this.

I have learned how bad religion can get in certain people.\n\nLike, it's genuinely disgusting how bad it gets. These are people trying to save us from sin? And they've got the GALL to shame us for enjoying books and video games. I used to have my doubts about Christianity meant to me, but after learning for the longest time that certain parts of the religion deemed suicide as a sin and hell worthy that was where I drew the line. I've come to the general conclusion that several hundred years ago religion was a method to control the weak, and instill good values in them so they didn't kill or harm others. Since the church and state have been separated and no longer dictate our lives, religion still exists, and I'll admit that for some people it's a good thing. \n\nBut for others who go out of their way to \"save\" others and force their beliefs on other people, they're better off keeping it to themselves.

I\u2019m sorry you had to deal with that. Most Catholics I know and real Christians are not like this. A lot of them mean well and want to spread the word because it has changed their lives and sometimes that comes off as very pushy, which I totally get. The vast majority of us understand that our relationship with God is ours alone and that relationship takes real effort to fortify every day of our lives. That is why so many people are so eager to spread the word. It has truly been life changing for a lot of people and the vast majority genuinely want that for others in a positive way. Unfortunately, the people that always get pushed to the forefront are people like the lady in your story. It is sad because it gives all of the rest of us a bad name. That woman is genuinely terrible. I don\u2019t know why she thought that was a good thing to do or that she needed to do that and be such a jerk about it. Something tells me it is not the first time she has done that. \n\nI hope your response is seared into her memory and maybe she will learn that treating people like that under the guise of \u201choliness\u201d only gives Christians a bad name and pushes people further and further away from the church. That is all she(and others like her) is doing: making us all look like judgmental assholes. It is not our responsibility to judge others, it is the responsibility of one person alone. \n\nI am very sorry if it seems like I am preaching to you, that is not my intention at all. I am just trying to convey that the vast majority of us are just normal people that don\u2019t spend every day judging others for stupid stuff like the books they read. \n\nIf anyone else reads this and has an interaction like you did with such an awful person, I implore them to do the same thing you did. My gosh that is so funny. Most of us believe what we believe for ourselves and don\u2019t try and push it. Also, most of us don\u2019t take ourselves too seriously because that is ridiculous. For example, I was on the Catholic subreddit rewind and one of the top posts was someone posting a picture of a poster they were gifted that pictured Jesus breaking Satan\u2019s ankles while they were playing basketball and Jesus was juking Satan and it broke his ankles. That is so freaking funny and your response to that lady reminded me so much of that picture. My goodness I am still legitimately laughing at the thought of it. I am playing it back in my head like I was a spectator seeing that happen and I would pay thousands of dollars to see the look on her face. \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\n\nI hope you have a great rest of your weekend.", "That lady succeeded her mission one way or another lol", "Reminds me of:*I'd rather laugh with the sinners than cry with the saints.
