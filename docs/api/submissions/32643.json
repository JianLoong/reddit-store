It felt really personal and hypocritical. I was so baffled.", "Pegan was the term used for christians at the start because they didnt believe in the main gods at the time. Atheists are called heathen yes but mostly as a derogatory term. The actual term heathen was used to describe the Germanic people who believed in the norse gods during that conversion period of that area. There are even people of the norse belief who have been reaching out to \"talk heathen\" to have then fox their name (but we both know that wont happen). Either way the end result is that I feel like OP isnt the AH and you feel she is, I feel like that's all there is to it.", "yeah to a certain extent, there is a bit of a discussion to be had, I'm curious as to why people think that she wasn't. it seems like almost everyone on the thread agrees that she was NTA except for myself.
