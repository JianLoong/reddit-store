After doing so, she said that her therapist also didn\u2019t think it was a good idea, as she believed that the drive behind her wanting to get the tattoo was her OCD, rather than the actual WANT of getting it. \n\nHowever, my GF still went ahead and booked the appointment. After talking with a couple friends about it, they all agreed that it wasn\u2019t a good idea to make such a permanent decision which has purely been fuelled by her OCD. \n\nIf she had somewhat recovered from her OCD, I wouldn\u2019t be so hesitant. However, she hasn\u2019t made any progress. \n\nI emailed the tattooist (we have each other\u2019s passwords) and cancelled her appointment. I told her an hour before her appointment that it had been cancelled, and as she had booked the last slot for the day, she was unable to get it done. \n\nI knew she was going to be upset, but I didn\u2019t really realise HOW upset she was going to be. It\u2019s been a couple of weeks, and it\u2019s honestly crazy how she\u2019s reacted to it, but I am more than certain (and so are our friends) that in the future once she recovers from her OCD, she will be really grateful. It\u2019s clear that it was OCD influenced, as it has flared up a bit because of it- and she\u2019s aware of that too- and has described it as making her physically sick when she thinks about the fact she\u2019ll never be able to get a tattoo on the 5th year anniversary. \n\nSo AITA?", "created_utc": 1679862325, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/122ye39/aita_for_cancelling_my_gfs_tattoo_appointment/", "score": 1214, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You're allowed to be concerned for her. You're allowed to discourage her from doing something you think she might regret. You're OK for even flat-out telling her it would be a mistake.\n\nYou are ***NOT*** ok making decisions for her. She is a grown adult, and no matter the reason can get a tattoo. You are her partner, not her father. Cancelling her appointment without her consent was beyond inappropriate. But you didn't even do that. You broke into her email and pretended to be her.\n\nYou are not helping her, no matter what your intentions are, by controlling her life. YTA.", "YTA \n\nYou\u2019re infantilising your girlfriend. She\u2019s capable of making decisions about what she does with her own body and it was 100% out of line for you to cancel her appointment", "YTA. You don\u2019t \u201crecover\u201d from OCD. You learn to manage it. It\u2019s not chlamydia or tonsillitis. You don\u2019t just pop a pill and it goes away. \n\nSo she can never get a tattoo on a significant date then? Because if you\u2019re waiting for her to recover, you\u2019re going to be waiting a long time. She\u2019s her own person. She\u2019s an adult. It\u2019s her body. If it\u2019s a mistake, it\u2019s hers to make.", "YTA\n\nJesus Christ, it's a tattoo to commemorate her mother. Even if the timing was more for her OCD than her mother, so what? \n\nYou don't even sound like you understood how much this would impact her, much less have a plan in place to help her cope. \n\nAt least she'll have no trouble getting a 5 year anniversary tattoo of your breakup.", "YTA for 5 reasons.

It\u2019s her body.", "YTA it's not your body and your brain and honestly none of your business, this was for her mother, and tattoos can be covered or removed if needed this was a serious breach of her privacy and you'll be lucky if you even have a girlfriend here soon, because most people would break up with you for this.", "YTA \nSince you mentioned you have each other\u2019s passwords I\u2019m taking that to mean you signed into your gf\u2019s email account and pretended to be her to contact the tattoo artist and cancel. You have no right to pretend to be someone else and cancel their appointments just because you don\u2019t like their choices. She can make her own decisions.", "YTA because you, her therapist, and her friends already voiced your worries to her. It\u2019s still her decision to make.", "YTA. \n\nYour girlfriend is an adult. That means she can get a tattoo for any reason at any time. She doesn't need your permission. She doesn't need protection from getting a tattoo. Even if she regrets the tattoo later. The fact that you call her reaction to you controlling her \"crazy\" says a lot about her need to end her relationship with you.", "YTA. How dare you make that decision for your girlfriend and cancel her appointment. It was controlling af and she should break up with you.", "Yes, YTA, and what you did is potentially dangerous. I\u2019m a retired therapist. OCD as a disorder can involve severe amounts of anxiety, and one\u2019s compulsions help to manage that anxiety. Preventing someone from engaging in compulsions is not at all recommended as an evidence based treatment, without having done the work to replace those compulsions in how a client manages their emotions, stresses, and anxieties. You\u2019re not a doctor, a therapist, or a mental health professional. You should never interfere in someone\u2019s treatment, which is what you did.\n\nEdited to add: there are unskilled therapists out there, and there are skilled therapists who are wrong. You took one therapist\u2019s opinion, and the opinions of a handful of untrained, uneducated peers to make this decision to take away your GF\u2019s power over her own life. Additionally, a central tenet of therapy assist clients in making their own decisions in as healthy a manner as possible, except in the case where there is a specific and genuine risk of significant harm to the client or someone else. This situation absolutely did not meet that criteria. If your Gf\u2019s therapist had done what you did, a formal complaint could be made against her to the board, and action might be taken against her. Please *do not* interfere with someone\u2019s treatment for medical conditions.", "YTA. That's an incredible abuse of having her password. It wasn't your decision to make for her. Maybe the tattoo was more driven by her OCD, yet it was still something that meant something to her and you have robbed her of that. I'm surprised you're not an ex by now.", "YTA she should dump your ass at 5:55 and be done with you", "YTA\n\nSo you think telling her she's not allowed to do anything that you, her therapist, and your friends aren't enthusiastic about is going to help her mental health?\n\nYour response to her OCD is just to manage her life and decisions for her?\n\nAstonishingly disrespectful.", "YTA. I get what you are trying to do but you are unqualified to actually help her management of OCD. The therapist is qualified. The therapist told her she didn\u2019t agree with it but allowed your GF to have her autonomy. It\u2019s like telling someone with depression you told them the wrong time for a friend\u2019s funeral because you didn\u2019t want them to be sad. Your actions didn\u2019t alter the mental illness, you just spiked her anger and sadness", "I don\u2019t really see how getting a tattoo for her passed mother could ever be a \u201cmistake\u201d", "INFO: among other lines you crossed, why are you having in-depth conversations about her mental health with your friends? Is she aware that you\u2019re all discussing her OCD and making group decisions for her behind her back?", "YTA. You need to learn about OCD. You don\u2019t recover, you manage it and nobody else can manage it for you. Her response is in line with her OCD. You can\u2019t expect her to respond the same way you would. You\u2019re not helping.", "\n\nHuge AH\n\nI don't think waiting 5 years could be considered impulsive.", "YTA\n\nDon\u2019t infantilize your significant other. That\u2019s gross and weird.", "YTA.

You were out of line.", "YTA - is this even a real question?

I hope she gets free of you soon.", "YTA, if she had OCD or not, she\u2019s not your child and she\u2019s still allowed to make decisions regardless of her mental illness. It\u2019s not a big deal either, it\u2019s just a tattoo\u2026 it\u2019s not like she was going to do something really drastic. Even if so, still her decision to make", "YTA you removed her autonomy.  Whether it was fueled by her OCD or not it wasn't your decision to make and from the sounds of it you've made her OCD spiral more with your actions.  I get you were coming from caring place but you fucked up.  OCD is a complicated condition to treat and manage.  Unless she's putting herself or others at immediate risk of death or serious harm then you shouldn't stop her from acting on her wants and needs.", "If you're adult and aren't permitted to make basic decision for yourself, then technically you're not free. \n\nWho appointed you to be your girlfriend's keeper? Has she been declared incompetent? I', guessing not. You had no right to interfere with her life or her getting a memorial tattoo. I really don't know who you think you are but it's clear you are only making things worse for her. \n\nIf she ever thought of you as a safe person, ally or boyfriend who had her back and truly cared about her feelings, she now knows better. You've lost her trust and please don't kid yourself that she's going to wake up one day and be grateful. OCD or not, she has rights and you violated them.

I mean, what if the anniversary was a national tattoo artist holiday? \n\nBut you are not her therapist. Her friends are not her therapists. She discussed it with her actual therapist, who said don't do it. She wanted to do it anyway - which could be the basis of fruitful discussions with her therapist. But you effed that up for her, convinced her that you consider her a child which cannot be helpful for her mental health, and you come in here wondering if you did the right thing? Dude, she wasn't sawing off her arm, she wanted a tattoo. \n\nHere's the thing. Zillions of people have tattoos they regret. Zillions of people have funny ice-breaker stories about a bad tattoo and now kind of like that \"bad\" tattoo even than their better and more carefully planned tattoos because ol' baddy reminds them of a place they were, and where they are now and how they got there. People save up and have regrettable tattoos removed. A tattoo is not the end of the world. It's just some ink. \n\nYou can support your gf and her therapy, or you can recognize that you want to infantilize her and let her go before you do more harm.", "YTA.\n\nYou realise your girlfriend is an adult, right?\n\nRegardless of whether or not this is tied to her OCD, it\u2019s something she wanted to do and you had absolutely no right to cancel her appointment. It\u2019s an incredibly controlling thing to do. \n\nYou didn\u2019t realise that controlling your girlfriend would result in her being upset? There\u2019s also a chance you taking away her decisions *could cause a flare up* around this whole process.\n\nEdit: Also, if you want to help her in the future, go and talk to a therapist about *how* you should help someone with OCD. A few of my relatives have OCD and you\u2019re supposed to offer a patient and understanding environment. \n\nIf the person is at a point where they\u2019re ready to tackle their compulsions, that has to be agreed upon together. That isn\u2019t a situation where you get to force them not to act on them as that can backfire astronomically. You can actively refuse to participate in any of their compulsions, but you don\u2019t get to force them not to act on them.", "I\u2019m not gonna lie, 5 is objectively the best number there is.", "YTA--it's her body, why would you try and police it?", "I think YTA", "YTA. I have OCD and would be livid as well if someone did this to me. Are some of my decisions influenced by my OCD? Absolutely! But like your GF I am seeing a therapist to help me understand why I make certain choices and to give me the tools to help. If I discuss something I want to do which may seem ill advised with my therapist we will explore why they and others may disagree but it\u2019s still ultimately my decision and no one else\u2019s. She clearly feels she wants to do something to remember her mother and on a date she felt was right and you have stopped that. Who cares if in the future she may regret a tattoo it\u2019s not the end of the world but you\u2019ve took away her choice and on a day that was really significant to her.", "YTA \n\nShe is allowed to get a tattoo on the 5th anniversary of her mothers death. \n\nYou have completely taken that away!\n\nYou have zero respect for your GFs autonomy! \n\nAnd how do you know what the Therapist said?", "As a 23 year old who\u2019s had SEVERE OCD since the age of 11, YTSUPERA. Oh my god, if my boyfriend did something like this to me I would be FUMING. While the tattoo may be driven by her OCD, it is still a tattoo for her DECEASED MOTHER and you took it upon yourself to cancel it! Who exactly do you think you are?! Even if she is struggling right now and gets that tattoo because of her OCD, it will still serve as a remembrance of her mother AND her battle with OCD. You fucking apologize to her RIGHT NOW, and hope to GOD that she doesn\u2019t end it with you!", "What the absolute F?? YTA. A huge one. You need therapy. Your girlfriend needs to run. Get a puppy.", "Yta you should\u2019ve spoken to her about it before not gone behind her back. What she does is her choice, you taking away her autonomy is absolutely so not helpful", "YTA. You are treating your girlfriend like a child and making decisions for her that she is perfectly capable of making for herself. You are using her OCD as an excuse for being overly controlling of her and you are totally overstepping. You are not her guardian, you are her *partner.*", "It\u2019s none of your business and its none of your friends business on what she does with her body. YTA, why did you think you had any say in this??", "YTA. She's an adult, and this was controlling af", "yta- i understand your concern but at the end of the day she is an adult and it is her body. Also the fact that she is doing through a difficult time with her loss this is the absolute worst way you could handle it- not only cancelling it but deciding this was an appropriate thing to discuss with friends instead of her directly. just reads as very immature and controlling.", "YTA. The fact that you impersonated her is already a jerk thing to do. But as someone who has been in recovery, one of the worst things people did was make decisions for me thinking they were helping, but in the long run it either made it worse or damaged my relationship with those people. I suggest you all make effort to research what a real support system looks like before you try and \"help\" this woman again.", "YTA\n\nWay to steal her autonomy! You could have just voiced your opinion but chose to impersonate her instead. I\u2019m surprised she\u2019s still with you.", "YTA. Either you\u2019re her partner, which means you have to not treat her like a child, or you\u2019re her guardian, in which case it\u2019s unethical and illegal to be in a relationship with her.", "YTA Who the fuck are you to decide this for her?? She made a decision about her body. HER body, not yours. How dare you go into her email without her permission (i have my partners passwords, doesn't give me the right to go through his shit without permission) and cancel it close enough that she couldn't rearrange. I'd have dumped you on the spot. Also, you don't get 'cured' from OCD and calling her 'crazy' shows you have 0 respect for her. I hope she finds a more supportive, respectful partner.", "YTA. She's an adult, not a kid. You're treating her like she were your minor daughter. That's controlling and icky.\n\nShe may very well regret getting a tattoo, but that's still her choice to make. Just because someone has a mental illness doesn't mean people have the right to step in and make decisions for them. The only way this would be okay would be if she were incapable of operating on her own. People with that level of mental illness are usually in institutions or require 24/7 care. Nothing you've said indicates this.", "YTA. She will always have OCD. There\u2019s no cure. You had no right to just cancel the appointment. I can get the concern that she was wanting to do this on the 5th anniversary, but it is a memorial piece. It sounds like something she wanted to get done and the OCD was playing into the timing. Because she has OCD it isn\u2019t possible that she could want to get a memorial piece? It\u2019s not an unusual thing to want to do. (I plan to get one for my grandparents.)", "YTA wtf", "YTA. Frankly, I hope she dumps you. You had no right at all to control her decisions, even though you justified it as something that was good for her. Going behind her back was an unbelievable level of control that shows you lack the ability to understand your role in other peoples lives. It doesn\u2019t matter if every single person thought it was a bad idea, she didn\u2019t and that is her right. If you want to control someone, get a dog.", "I have some mental health issues myself. Someone important in my life also fucked up an important-to-me event recently, and I can never get it back. It's been months, and it still makes me incredibly upset when I so much as think about it. It really hurts like no other, because I realized how little he respects me. It just revealed a pattern, and by the sounds of it, that's what happened with your girlfriend. I also haven't spoken to the person in question since then.   \nI also lost my mother when I was fairly young. If someone messed up an important anniversary surrounding her death, I would absolutely *lose my shit.* And that's not coming from a place of mental illness, that's coming from a place of being a mourning child. You're lucky all she's doing is ghosting you. I'd mess you RIGHT up.   \nAlso, she will never \"recover\" from OCD. This is a part of her life and herself that won't ever go away, just like my mental health issues will probably never leave me, either. YOU are the one who will have to live with it and get over it if you want a future with this girl. But honestly? I hope she leaves your inconsiderate, controlling ass. YTA, big time.   \n\n\nAnd I don't know if you need to hear this, but....No, do NOT reach out to her or try to apologize. She doesn't wanna hear it. Best you can do is leave her the hell alone.", "YTA - it\u2019s her body, it\u2019s her decision, it would have harmed no one, many people get memorial tattoos to help with grief, and you have no right to decide what is and is not good for her. Oh look, that\u2019s 5", "YTA \n\nOh and this will be hard to read, cause I think you mean well, but you\u2019ve become a toxic bf. Crossing boundaries like that, controlling her like a child - this is classic co dependency.

YTA you took away her opportunity to do something to remember her mom on  a specific anniversary- she can never get that back", "But, but, his FRIENDS who are in no way qualified, agreed, so he must be right! /s", "Wait, did I misread this? Are we talking about your underage child?\n\nNo, no, I read it right. We're talking a grown woman whom you would like us to think you love. Jury's out there. But you clearly don't respect her.\n\nI wonder what you, her therapist and her friends all thought would happen if she got that tattoo? Did you think she would instantly go mad? Join the Society of the Hand? What?\n\nSurely none of you thought that NOT getting it would make her BETTER, did you? Frankly, if her therapist thought so, then they are a pretty bad therapist.\n\nYTA, in an obnoxious,  ableist way that is pretty repellent to read. I hope your girlfriend finds someone who respects, honors and lifts her up instead of snatching away from her something that will never come again.", "YTA\n\nIf you want to parent someone, have a kid.", "YTA you\u2019re her boyfriend not her owner", "YTA clearly", "YTA \n\nEven if you're correct and she would have one day regretted the tattoo, you still had no right to interfere.

You voiced your concern, her therapist voiced their concern but bottom line it\u2019s your gf\u2019s decision on how she wants to commemorate her mother. Your gf will always have OCD are you going to override her body autonomy every time she chooses to do something you don\u2019t like and blame it on her mental health?", "YTA jesus christ\n\nYou purposefully exacerbated her OCD because you thought you knew better than her about what she wants.\n\nShe deserves a better partner.", "How big was the tatoo? If it was a small one then YTA, who cares if she regrets it later.\n\nYTA", "YTA. While this may have been driven by her ocd and not her actual desire to get a tattoo it\u2019s still her decision. You should have tried getting to talk to her therapist more and let her make the decision to cancel the appointment. Also you could have explained the situation to the artist and let him make the decision to cancel based on what he was comfortable with", "YTA.\n\nAlong with everyone around her apparently", "YTA Although your actions were with the best of intentions, she is an adult and can make her own choices. Having talked it out with you and her therapist, and she's still choosing to ignore the advice, that's on her. You two voiced your concerns, now her body her choice. Also, it may be something she actually does want and not related to her OCD like you and her therapist think.  I suggest really thinking about how you treat her. Are you supporting her like a partner or parenting her? You've stepped into the parenting role on this occasion. Maybe process before for you do something....alAm I being supportive or parenting/controlling her?", "Yes, YTA. You think you're helping, while you and your friends make decisions about her life and her body.\n\nYou're terrible, and I hope she dumps your ass for this.", "YTA. That is controlling!\nYou are allowed to say you are completely against something - and that is it. You are NOT ALLOWED to make decisions for her.", "YTA. You don\u2019t get to control what another adult does with/to their body, as long as it\u2019s legal. You don\u2019t have to like it, but it\u2019s not your decision.", "YTA. She can make her own choices, even if everyone thinks it\u2019s not a good idea, she gets the final say. She\u2019s not getting surgery, it\u2019s just a tattoo. It isn\u2019t going to ruin her life. You\u2019re trying to control her; you\u2019re abusing her trust and infantilizing her. She isn\u2019t yours to control.", "YTA. You DO NOT get to decide things for her like that. Whether it's ocd or not, it's ultimately her choice. You did NOT handle in her best interest but in what you THOUGHT would be her interest. But you get to have an opinion not take over.\n\nAs someone who has a mild variant of ocd I guarantee you, you have harmed and you have fucked up so bad. OCD is a disorder that comes with intrusive thoughts and a fear of losing control you desperately wanted to maintain. What you did is literally make her lose control over a situation by taking it from her. \n\nThere is a reason why OCD therapy even exposure happens in a controlled way and a controlled environment. It's about building up trust in yourself with help of people who know what they are doing.\n\nWhat you basically did is tell your girlfriend she isn't to be trusted and shouldn't trust herself. Well. Fucking. Done. *slow clap*", "YTA\n\nIt's none of your business, and you unilaterally made a decision for her without her consent. You are also asking her friends to weigh in with an opinion on something that is not their business, either. Who made you god? Why should she ever trust you again when you treated her like a child and took all power out of her hands?", "YTA. she is not a child and you are not a licensed psychologist. you took away her autonomy on something important to her. on top of that, you are defending it by being incredibly ableist and implying that she is helpless to her mental illness so you\u2019re entitled to decide what she\u2019s allowed to choose for herself.", "YTA. I have OCD, and I understand what you were thinking but you definitely crossed a line here. I don\u2019t know if this is at all helpful or if you\u2019ll be receptive to this suggestion, but if you want to help her with her OCD, your only role in that is by not accommodating it. For example, my OCD is morality/religious focused (what if I\u2019m a bad person, what if God hates me, etc.) My bf\u2019s job is not to reassure me if I ask him those questions. But say I made an appointment with a priest or something to find out if I\u2019m a bad person. He could not and should not cancel that for me. He could advise against it. But the decision - and the commitment to recovery - has to be mine. I recommend researching OCD and exposure response prevention if you haven\u2019t yet because there are definitely ways you can help her but this was not one.", "YTA, this isn't your call to make.\n\nIf she gets a regrettable tattoo, then that's her problem.\n\nYou're not qualified to deal with this, she has very severe OCD, she needs real help, not you just making decisions for her based on no experience whatsoever.", "YTA, you were way out of line to use her email to cancel the appointment. It\u2019s none of your business what she does with her body and even if she ended up regretting it later on (which we don\u2019t know for a fact despite you thinking you know better than her), that\u2019s on her. Nothing wrong with voicing your opinion but it should have stopped there", "YTA.\n\nYou should have talked her out of it instead of going behind her back to manipulate the situation. If you couldn\u2019t have talked her out of it then you should have let her go through with it and maybe learned her lesson or maybe gotten a tattoo she would cherish forever.\n\nWho knows, maybe it would have been a mistake so big that it would made her rethink her OCD tendencies and help her get over them. Guess we\u2019ll never know\u2026", "YTA\n\nYou're her partner, not her parent. Learn the difference. If she's adult enough to date you, she's adult enough to make her own decisions without your interference.", "YTA. FFS stop saying you\u2019re waiting for her to \u201crecover\u201d from OCD bc you don\u2019t, you manage your OCD. As someone with OCD, there is nothing you could possibly do to help.

Second, you took her choice away by posing as her to cancel the appointment, and then not tell her about it until an hour before the appointment (presumably when she was getting ready to go to the parlor). Third, how can the desire to get a tattoo to honor her mother be fueled by the OCD if she MADE. AN. APPOINTMENT! If it was a spur of the moment thing, which you allude to with the comment for her wanting things done in 5s, she would have swung by one of the less busy parlors and had it done on the spot. Not talk to her therapist, not talk to her friends, not talk to you about it. Fourth, you are treating her like a child and now wonder why she isn't opening up to you, except to tell you that she is in deep despair over not being able to do a specific thing to commemorate her mother's passing. If one day she woke up and wondered what the heck she was thinking in getting the tattoo, that is still her decision...not yours.

After doing so, she said that her therapist also didn\u2019t think it was a good idea, as she believed that the drive behind her wanting to get the tattoo was her OCD, rather than the actual WANT of getting it. \n\nHowever, my GF still went ahead and booked the appointment. After talking with a couple friends about it, they all agreed that it wasn\u2019t a good idea to make such a permanent decision which has purely been fuelled by her OCD. \n\nIf she had somewhat recovered from her OCD, I wouldn\u2019t be so hesitant. However, she hasn\u2019t made any progress. \n\nI emailed the tattooist (we have each other\u2019s passwords) and cancelled her appointment. I told her an hour before her appointment that it had been cancelled, and as she had booked the last slot for the day, she was unable to get it done. \n\nI knew she was going to be upset, but I didn\u2019t really realise HOW upset she was going to be. It\u2019s been a couple of weeks, and it\u2019s honestly crazy how she\u2019s reacted to it, but I am more than certain (and so are our friends) that in the future once she recovers from her OCD, she will be really grateful. It\u2019s clear that it was OCD influenced, as it has flared up a bit because of it- and she\u2019s aware of that too- and has described it as making her physically sick when she thinks about the fact she\u2019ll never be able to get a tattoo on the 5th year anniversary. \n\nSo AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "What kind of tattoo did she want? I think if she wanted a teeny tiny one, then wtf man, let her do it. If it was a full sleeve or a bigger tattoo\u2026 that\u2019s a different story. You shouldn\u2019t have cancelled the appointment though, you don\u2019t control her. You could\u2019ve gone with her and continued to express your feelings.", "NTA. Sometimes we do things for the people we love because its right for them. Even when they hate you for it. Ignore these hyper individualists.", "YTA. Don't cancel appointments that don't belong to you. And FYI, you don't \"recover\" from OCD. It's permanent. You manage it. You live with it. \n\nBe less of a jerk.", "Exactly why I am super against sharing passwords with partners. Assholes like this always think they know best for u and don't care how they do it. Family,  husband idc, as an adult I ain ever giving someone that power over me. Unfortunate people have such entitlement.", "Came here to say this. OCD is a mental health disorder like anxiety or depression; it can\u2019t be cured. Like prairieislander said, you learn to manage through medication, therapy, and coping strategies. It will always be with her and she will always have symptoms, the pills only alleviate symptoms.", "Seriously. I have OCD and I would not want to be stopped over this. Giving in to a compulsion is not always a bad thing, especially if it isn't harmful. If you're standing at the front door for 25 minutes unlocking and relocking it then we have a problem. But checking to be sure the door is locked before going to bed at night (checking just once) is actually a healthy and safe habit to have, even if it started with OCD. \n\nAnd also, wanting something and feeling compelled by OCD are not mutually exclusive. I can want to buy something because I think it's cute but also because I touched it and suddenly feel a compulsion to buy it. It doesn't mean the item is \"tainted\" because I had a compulsion. It's still a cute object that I can enjoy later on. Usually a compulsion only lasts a moment - so even if getting the tattoo was a compulsion, having it can be a thing of joy.", "Not only that but he's calling her response to his manipulation and control \"crazy,\" like someone should just shrug off their boyfriend telling them they should lose agency because they're dealing with OCD. \n\nI get the feeling any time she does anything he doesn't like he attributes it to mental illness.", "My guess her OCD has nothing to really do with it.

I like numbers that end in 5.", "I have ocd as well, it flared up after my brothers passing. I got a tattoo of him with specific number of words and specific number of lines due to my ocd. I also got a second tatto same day that I picked out last second due to my ocd ( not wanting to only have one tattoo) \n\nIf someone would\u2019ve prevented me from going to that tattoo appointment I would\u2019ve cut them out of my life.", "What did the puppy do to deserve OP? \n\nYTA", "Even if it's \"driven by her OCD\", who tf is going to regret a MEMORIAL tattoo? Was she trying to get it on her face, or something? Maybe OCD was part of her drive to get it done on that date, but unless she was trying to get 5 tattoos then it wasn't what was driving her to get a tattoo. I hope she gets the tattoo regardless. If OP doesn't recognize how controlling it is to cancel someone's tattoo appointment or how invalidating it is to say that she can't make decisions about her own body because of OCD then the girlfriend needs to seriously consider whether OP is the guy for her.", "Even if he was \"protecting\" her, he went about it in a shit way.

I don\u2019t regret my decision. Sure I don\u2019t really care for the second tattoo I got since it has to personal meaning but I\u2019m glad I got the tattoo of my brother.

It's one thing to let the person know what they're doing may be harmful, but when you start impersonating someone to make decisions for them, you have crossed the line. If somebody has bipolar, unless they are actively trying to hurt themselves or in their lives, the best way to go about it is to speak your mind and be open to helping them pick up the pieces when they fail.

I also noticed that he didn't mention anything about it being her first tattoo, which I would have expected as part of his concerns, so I assume she's gotten at least one.

I wasn\u2019t thinking about the time-sensitivity of the tattoo.\n\nI agree, I doubt it\u2019s going to be a face or neck tattoo and I doubt it is a particularly objectionable tattoo from how OP described it. \n\nBut I\u2019m also hearing that a lot of people who know OP\u2019s GF: her friends, her therapist, and OP, all objected. I worry that there\u2019s something about the situation \u2014 the tattoo itself, OP\u2019s GF\u2019s OCD, or her personality, or something else \u2014 that is missing from the post.\n\nHaving said that, I\u2019ve edited my initial verdict to Y T A.", "YTA.

If that were the case, I'd be concerned but it was 1 tattoo not 5. OP also doesn't state what the tattoo is *of* nor why the gf chose that design. And how does OP know what the therapist thinks of the tattoo? Is he going to therapy with her, or is the therapist telling him, and if so does the gf give permission for this? There are so many red flags that OP is controlling.\n\nWhat really clinches it for me though is OP saying that the tattoo must have been driven by OCD because now her OCD is acting up. No sir, her OCD is acting up because she is STRESSED which is a trigger for OCD habits. Educate yourself. The higher the stress, the stronger those impulses can become. Additionally, she isn't upset about not getting the tattoo she's upset about not getting it on a specific date that was significant to her. Meaning she recognizes she can still get the tattoo (and likely will, maybe on the 10 year, or on the 5th day of a month, or something) and is really only upset that she missed the significant date. Which is further proof that the tattoo itself is not the OCD symptom, the date on which she gets it is. \n\nOP, YTA and you need to better educate yourself on OCD.\n\nEdit: I misread how he found out about what the therapist said.

In the person affected, their patterns are necessary rituals that they *must* complete. It feels logical to them. Do this, or bad things happen. Numerical rituals are really hard to break, and so if the only OCD ritual she has is to do everything in 5's like OP says then she would feel the compulsion to get 5 tattoos. Otherwise, if she saw just *one* tattoo on her body it would likely cause significant distress. But there are intricacies, which we obviously do not have here because OP seems to grossly misunderstand OCD in general.

My point is everyone's OCD is specific and unique, and I wanted to make sure people reading this don't have this as their takeaway about OCD.\n\nI have OCD, and the number of times someone tried to \"gotcha\" me with logic they extrapolated from what little I tell them is really harmful and invalidating. \n\nI have a whole separate comment on my thoughts on OPs situation, but I wanted to share some learned and lived knowledge so as not to perpetuate any misunderstandings of OCD.\n\nETA: I appologise for any clarity issues.

Then there were non-harmful compulsions (plug your phone in, unplug it, plug it in, unplug, plug it in). Harmful, we worked on trying to manage. Non-harmful, we left alone. It's often distressing for people with OCD to fight against their compulsions. Years ago, we couldn't get this family member to seek treatment because they didn't believe they had OCD and we just learned how to navigate and work with them rather than against them. It's the best we could do. \n\nGetting a tattoo on a date that is significant is what I would call non-harmful. The tattoo itself isn't the compulsion - the day on which they get it is. This is solely based on the information he provided, and he doesn't tell us what the tattoo is or how long she was thinking of getting it or anything that could help us to know if the tattoo itself is the issue. So on that info alone, he chose to force her to not act on a non-harmful compulsion which is now causing her great distress.

So the decision to get a tattoo was not fueled by the OCD, only the decision to get it on that date. In that case the tattoo isn't the issue here, the date is, and for a subjectively non-neurodivergent person to think that getting the tattoo on a significant date is so bad that he felt compelled to cancel the entire appointment is just...bizarre.

People need to understand that just because she has a condition, doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019s lost all common sense?!", "I have OCD and honestly the biggest issue here is him interfering with her therapy. Yes she needs exposure therapy (sitting with her impulses, etc) but that needs to happen on her OWN time with the guidance of her therapist, not her boyfriend. \n\nThis is like shoving someone who can't swim yet into the deep end of the pool, and would obviously stress me and make my anxiety/OCD worse, not better.", "I'm no expert but my guess is the OCD did not cause her to want the tattoo, it caused her to want to get the tattoo on that specific date. Like, she probably would've wanted the tattoo anyway but it wouldn't have been so important to do it on the 5th anniversary.  Unless the tattoo she was planning to get was something completely absurd, I don't see why OP is convinced this was a bad idea.\n\nDeath anniversaries are really hard, so I understand why she's upset that OP interfered with how she was going to honor her mom on that day.", "Come on. The fact that it HAS to be on the 5th year anniversary makes it pretty evident it was OCD driven. Otherwise she could just get it at literally any other time and it would be no big deal.", "My guess is he doesn't like them and doesn't want her to get one period. The OCD is an excuse.", "What the fuck is OP doing gossiping about her to his friends anyway?  That's just as shitty as going behind her back to cancel her appointment.  He obviously has zero respect for her and she should dump him pronto.", "Right except the therapist also said it was a bad idea, so that doesn\u2019t count positively toward her decisions to get it. He still shouldn\u2019t have cancelled the appointment behind her back though", "Thats not how ocd really works buddy", "I work in a group home for adults with developmental delays.  We can't force any individual to take their meds or follow doctor recommendations.  We can encourage, prompt, and educate, but we can not force them.  Because even with their various diagnoses, they are adults and allowed autonomy.\n\nSo yes I would say that if the OP forced his gf to take prescribed meds, he would be infantilizing her because it isn't his place to make her choices.  If he doesn't agree, he doesn't have to continue a relationship with her, but he doesn't get to decide for her.", "I hope she dumps his ass", "I hope she changes all her passwords and dumps this controlling AH", "Or checking like six times.  \ud83d\ude2c. (I had my anxiety/agoraphobia manifest like this a few years ago, and I still feel a pull occasionally.)", "I honestly wouldn't even think it was odd if a friend turned up with their straightners in their bag because they were always worried they'd left them on. It has zero impact on anyone else, so live yo life.", "Exactly! It\u2019s all about harm reduction. \n\nI told my exposure therapist once that I\u2019d stayed awake all night fighting a compulsion to check my closet for a bat, which would involve taking everything out and doing an exhaustive, obsessive search, and he was like \u201cwell you should have done it\u201d and I was like whattttt surprised pikachu face, cause I thought the whole point was to make the compulsions go entirely away. He taught me that eventually we don\u2019t want to have any fear of a bat in the house, but if it\u2019s keeping me up all night, it makes way more sense to search the closet and get some rest. Luckily I am to the \u201cno fear of a bat in the house\u201d point by now, but the logic still applies!", "Why do I feel like everybody around her just doesn't like tattoos in general? Getting a tattoo on a specific anniversary or to mark a big life event is nothing new.\n\nI don't think she was getting a tattoo *because of* her OCD, instead the fact that she could tie it to her compulsion likely gave her great comfort *due to* her OCD.\n\nAnd now she will never get that chance back.", "Probably because he knows the gf well enough? At the end she was \"physically sick cause she would never get it on the 5th anniversary\" like this isn't some usual homage situation, even her therapist said so.", "> her therapist is presumably more educated than you about mental illness and OCD and advised her against getting the tattoo\n\nI rather doubt the therapist advised that OP should control his girlfriend by going behind her back to prevent her from getting the tattoo.", ">but her therapist is presumably more educated than you about mental illness and OCD \n\nI agree with this statement. Most therapists are more educated about the conditions of their patients than random internet posters.  However, Therapists are only human, and a number of them have some serious biases against anything out of what they consider normal.  That the therapist thinks choosing to get this tattoo because of OCD doesn't mean a thing, because that therapist may have something against tattoos.   \n\nDon't accept a secondhand account of someone's expert witness at face value.", "I mean that's true but there are a lot of neurodivergent symptoms that neurotypical people experience often, but it doesn't make them neurodivergent. For instance I have an anxiety disorder, and a *lot* of neurotypical people throughout my life since I got my diagnosis and started treatment have told me they have anxiety too, but they just \"push through it\" or similar phrases of what they think is helpful. Until they see me collapse from my BP going haywire from tachycardia, or crying with indecisive paralysis, or any other of my very physical and serious symptoms they just *cannot* understand how their anxiety is different from mine. So wanting to get a tattoo on a significant date is pretty normal for a neurotypical person, but for a neurodivergent person who has OCD it is way way beyond just a *want*.", "I have OCD and my patterns make sense to ME. I don\u2019t need or like when someone tries to \u201clogic\u201d me out of my pattern. It stresses me out and triggers and anxiety attack because I am now doubting if my pattern makes sense at all. If it makes sense to the person experiencing it then leave it alone.", "OCD *OFTEN* follows patterns. Like...... that's kinda exactly the big deal with OCD, having to follow the pattern or being extremely uncomfortable.", "You don't think that you'd be FURIOUS if someone made a unilateral decision FOR YOU and canceled an appointment that was important to you (for whatever reason) and that you were looking forward to?", "Nope, that just means the day she gets it is driven by the OCD. Not the tattoo itself.", "Exactly. Probably thinks they\u2019re \u201ctrashy\u201d or something. Doesn\u2019t want such things on \u201chis girl\u201d.", "Yeah, I would absolutely not stay with someone who pulled this.", "I mean, it is possible that she wanted to get a tattoo based on a pattern of fives, and therefore one tattoo would suffice. But yeah, this is probably a tattoo to commemorate her loss, not driven by OCD.", "Why does it matter if the therapist thinks it\u2019s a bad idea?   I would bet good money that the same therapist who doesn\u2019t agree with the tattoo idea also wouldn\u2019t be happy with the boyfriend going behind the patient\u2019s back and cancelling the appointment.   The therapist can think it\u2019s a bad idea and still recognize the patient is a grown up.", "Exactly. That really bugged me. I have OCD, and it's not something that clears up or goes away. No amount of Sertraline or Fluoxetine is gonna 'fix' OCD. Medicine and therapy can absolutely help reduce the effects, but won't make them disappear completely. She won't 'recover' from OCD. \n\nOne of my long-standing OCD mannerisms (in terms of when it became apparent/constant) is also related to numbers. I have to eat things in 2s (or multiples of 2). Bag of M&Ms? Grab two individual candies at a time. Offer to share your popcorn with me at the movies? I will take two pieces. If there is one single cookie left in the pack of Oreos, I will almost always leave it for someone else, with very rare exception.\n\nI 'realized this was kinda stupid' a few years back and tried to change it. Learned very quickly that it wasn't going to go away, and since it's not hurting anyone, I left it be. If a mannerism so small and insignificant can't go away after a decade of meds, and an actual, conscious attempt to change the behavior, then something of the same nature at a larger scale is not going to be something OP's gf will 'recover' from.", "Yea I have OCD and OCD is for life haha, you can get better, but it will always be there", ">You told OP they need to better educate themselves,\n\nBecause they do. If you Google OCD, you'd know more than OP does. It's not hard. He's literally said he believes she can be cured of OCD. That's monumentally false. So yes, he needs to educate himself if he really wants to be of help to his gf.", "Agreed! The biggest factor for mental health (as I understand it) is whether it causes harm/dysfunction to the individual or others around them. How does her getting a tattoo hurt anyone except maybe her if she regrets it later, but that's a crap reason to stop anyone from doing anything (on the off chance they might regret it later).\n\nI also find it really hard to believe that the therapist said \"it's a bad idea\" if the therapist is trained in OCD, then they know these are compulsions and making a judgement call on something she's compelled to do would only hurt their therapeutic relationship.\n\nETA: OP YTA for taking this decision away from her and diminishing her autonomy because she struggles with mental illness.", "I\u2019m curious what is indicating to him that her OCD is not managed right now. He didn\u2019t give any insight into how her OCD controls her bc he gave no examples, just said that she does everything in 5\u2019s. That can mean a lot of things, sometimes it\u2019s just certain things that need to be done ritualistically, sometimes it\u2019s many things.", "Yeah, I rationalised it as it was the 5 year anniversary so that was her intensity over THIS PARTICULAR ONE.  Because the anniversary is the important part, not necessarily the tattoo - she just got fixated on the tattoo as a side effect of the 5 year part.\n\nAnd while it may be driven by her OCD, I do think both OP and the therapist are AHs because it\u2019s been shown that an important part of dealing with grief is maintaining a connection to the lost life.  The old philosophy of \u201cjust let it go and move on\u201d has been shown to be more traumatic and damaging.\n\nSo the tattoo may also have alleviated stress and helped with grief of the anniversary of the loss as well.  And if that\u2019s what she was comfortable with doing, then that was the right thing for her to do.", "OCD meds lessen the anxiety one feels when they cannot complete a ritual. That\u2019s what it does for me. I still do the action that my OCD demands of me but I don\u2019t have the huge feeling of doom before I do it. I am able to do the action without having a feeling of my world ending if I don\u2019t do it.", "I agree. I was diagnosed with OCD when I was 6, and the absolute best I can do is manage it. Some days it really feels like I don\u2019t have it and I can live normally (in regards to the OCD). Other days I slip up and perform one of my rituals. It took me over 10 years of therapy and medication to get to this point, and it\u2019s never going to go away completely, even another decade after I no longer needed constant treatment. Therapy helped me recognize maladaptive thought patterns and combat them in order to keep myself from performing my rituals. It also helped me recognize and control the fear I had of not completing my rituals due to said thoughts. Meds just helped lower the anxiety to a level where I could start learning to manage it, but they aren\u2019t a cure.", "My precise language is literally just how I talk. I use words very deliberately. I have trouble interpreting nuances from strangers whose speech patterns I am not familiar with so I take everything pretty literally unless it's spelled out for me otherwise.\n\nBut hey, I also know when to admit I made a mistake so there's a plus! I did review the post and see where he says she told him. My apologies for this misunderstanding. The rest of my post and my judgment stands, but I'll edit the original comment to reflect my mistake. Thanks!", "This is a real thing. My ex was a FLAMING narcissist and found it was extremely easy to gaslight me. \n\nHow? \n\nI have ADHD and PTSD, both of which result in some memory issues. He figured out it was easier to say I had agreed with something/he hadn't done something because I wouldn't remember it, which made my symptoms worse. This created a vicious cycle of abuse that was almost impossible to break out of. \n\nOP, YTA, and I think YOU need a therapist too.", "Yes, this was my thought too.", "I'm not trying to change your mind. And, having a difference of opinion is fine. My issue is more with the logic and devices used in the prose to make your point. Some of which are persuasive and often used in a disingenuous manner to 'win' discussions.\n\nWhether intended or not, you portray yourself as an authority by stating the number of years in which you've had 'experience' with the illness. This is common for professionals when establishing credibility on a specific subject matter. Still, your use of such device wouldn't be problematic if followed by an anecdote or obvious opinion. Instead, you proceeded to deliver some blanket statements, with relative certainty, on a complex mental illness.\n\nAgain, this is nothing personal. I only called it out due to the style of argument. Beware the intersection of tenuous credibility, certainty of the speaker, complexity of the subject at hand, and casual insinuation of possible conspiracy (the red flag). It's how we got a patchwork of abortion laws across states, and many other poor health outcomes.", "Mine is well managed to the point I\u2019m not medicated for it anymore.\n\nBut I still do some things in threes and like things in threes.  Like I\u2019ll send 3 emojis or I\u2019ll click my car alarm three times.\n\nNow that you mention that, I guess I got lucky, none of my partners have ever been bothered by my desire for things in threes.\n\nThere was a time where my current partner questioned why I always bought three of a particular food item and not more (or less) since he knew it was something I liked a lot and I kind of blanked in the moment and didn\u2019t really have an answer and then it clicked in his head with the threes and he said never mind.  Because I would buy 3 and then run out and go to the store and get three more some weeks.", "Recovering from addiction is another one that gets people to try and control your habits. I get pissed thinking about all the partners who would start to count my drinks when alcohol wasn't even my drug of choice. \n\nI've seen it somewhat with autism spectrum but I think the autism usually wins that battle lol."]}
