He sounds like a spoiled butthead.", "NTA. That's jealousy and not something you have done wrong. I know it's taboo to have favorites and with young kids like yours I can see it, but I guess I don't see why having adult favorites is bad. Sounds like you might be the favorite and it's due to your commitment to the relationship, which in turn makes your child look like the favorite. My wife's brothers always complain she is the favorite and I always want to say well she's the one that helps the most, will pick up the tab at a restaurant, doesn't abuse babysitting privileges, etc. Maybe having a favorite kid or grandkids when they are adults is acceptable even if awkward to state.", "NTA.
