He sounds like a spoiled butthead.", "NTA. That's jealousy and not something you have done wrong. I know it's taboo to have favorites and with young kids like yours I can see it, but I guess I don't see why having adult favorites is bad. Sounds like you might be the favorite and it's due to your commitment to the relationship, which in turn makes your child look like the favorite. My wife's brothers always complain she is the favorite and I always want to say well she's the one that helps the most, will pick up the tab at a restaurant, doesn't abuse babysitting privileges, etc. Maybe having a favorite kid or grandkids when they are adults is acceptable even if awkward to state.", "NTA.  His problem is with Nan, not you.  He has to fix his relationship with her, not you. Stay out of it.", "NTA\n\nIt's his job to foster a relationship between his child and others at that early of an age. Especially with a family member who is ailing or aging. You out in the effort to fly her out to you and your son. She raised your cousins daughter for the early parts of her life. What does your other cousin do? Nothing. Even within 10 minutes of Nan.", "My grandma has two grandchildren, there is 12 years between us. The first 5 years she was with me from the moment she came home from work till I went to bed. I spend half of all my vacations from school at her place and idk how many weekends as she lived 10 min on bike from us. She took me to amusements parks etc etc. \nwhen my cousin was born there was none of that for many reasons like he lived to far away and she was much older. \nNTA. Sometimes some grandchildren is just closer", "ESH you should all be on the same page and advocate for them to be treated the same. Nana is the biggest AH though because she is the one doing it.", "NTA.\n\nBut obviously you and Nan know that it's not Harry's kids fault that Harry is an asshole. I don't think presents matter much when nephew is so young, but as he grows older it would be good for him to have memories and a connection with Nan. If she's still around", "He lives a 10 minute walk away, and he\u2019s very capable of going to visit her, he just doesn\u2019t on a regular basis - he would easily go months without seeing her", "Then NTA, what the heck is wrong with him? Although I wonder why Nan doesn\u2019t just go visit if he really lives so close", "NTA. This is really tough. I come from an Italian family (both sides). Our tradition is the first son is named for the paternal grandfather. So I carry his first and last names - and my grandfather was \u201cDon Corleone\u201d (minus the crime). He did A LOT for EVERYONE. No pressure there.\n\nI\u2019m the fourth grandchild, with three female cousins ahead of me. We\u2019re all close, which is how my grandparents wanted it. But I know I was the favorite. Everyone else does also. One aunt never cared for me (or my mother, who was the DIL who had the audacity to give birth to the \u201cfuture king\u201d), but other than that it\u2019s fine. But everyone knows.\n\nI\u2019m 42 years old; they\u2019ve been gone since I was 25 and 28 respectively (and I miss them more than I could ever put into words). As I became an adult I gave back to them. Nobody spent as much time with them as I did, not even their three sons. At least once a week I\u2019d make the 100-mile drive to see them - often twice. I never left their sides until the end, and I dedicated the rest of my life to their memory. Anytime anyone brings up that I was favored, I take it for what it\u2019s worth. But I also know I gave back to them, and I think they respected that very much.\n\nI get where your cousin is coming from. But how is this your fault? Maybe he should talk to your grandmother, since you know, it\u2019s his son. He\u2019s using you because you\u2019re close to your grandmother. I get his angst, I really do. But it sounds like similar to me, you\u2019ve given back to your grandmother over the years. Can he say the same?", "op=nta\n\nFirst I love how it's Nan favors everyone but MY child(Harry).  Not quite how that works.\n\nUnless it's racism/phobia/religion--then that's another truck alltogether.\n\nHarry needs to step up and let his kid get to know great-nan if he wants his kid to get \"equal\" treatment.", "Harry is the one with the issue.  He's the one that's not facilitating a relationship between his child and his Nan.  Nan doesn't know the kid so might just be getting generic gifts.", "NTA\n\nYour son isn't the favored grandchild. She has a relationship with him. Big difference. My paternal grandparents helped raise my cousins but they lived states away, so we weren't close.\n\nHowever, my mom was incredibly close to her mother, and my brother and I saw her at least once a week so my brother and I had more of a relationship with her. \n\nYou have to INTERACT with people to know them.", "I mean, Harry isn't treating Nan the same as OP and the other cousin either. He's not putting in the effort to spend time with her like OP and the other cousin are.", "Gah. This sounds like my BIL. We live the furthest from my partner\u2019s grandmother, and he lives the closest. Yet we visit most often, and in between visits we video call and check in \u2026 because she\u2019s old, and enjoys talking to her great grandchildren", "So grown adult should take it out on a one year old? Harry might not be able to afford it. Nan can certainly choose to treat them the same though.", "We can't love kids we don't see", "Are you serious? A one year old deserves to be punished/ valued less because their parents don\u2019t see family.", "She did nothing to punish the one year old. We know when y get a gift y will be more generous with the people y see more. Furthermore the kid doesn't know or care about his nanny he is still young and will feel happy with any gifts. Harry is the entitled one not the baby.", "\u2018You can\u2019t love a baby you don\u2019t see\u2019 how is that not a punishment? \n\nAt this moment the baby is unaware. Do you really think that\u2019s going to change as they all get older? That baby is going to grow up and will notice in time. It will impact the relationship all for something that child had no control over. Harry is acting entitled and is a freaking adult who makes his choices. The child shouldn\u2019t be held accountable for that though. They weirdly are seperate to Harry.\n\nETA: growing up we often didn\u2019t see one set of my grandparents due to DV/ isolating us from family. They didn\u2019t love us less, they didn\u2019t give us less than my other cousins. I couldn\u2019t imagine how it would be not being able to control the situation but seeing the difference in how your treated. Every time we did see them they always said they loved us, they sent us cards/ gifts ect that were the same as my cousins. When I could I made sure to reach out and reconnect. I\u2019m now a parent and my kids have grandparent who live long distances away and we can\u2019t see them as much as we want. They again don\u2019t treat their grandchildren less than the grandchildren they see more often because they live closer. \n\nI really hope you don\u2019t have grandchildren.", "Why is Harry confronting you or Sarah about this? *answer*  because he knows that if he were to talk to Nan about this he would come across as the entitled idiot that he is showing you.\nNTA", "ESH. You knows there's favoritism but don't do anything because it benefits your daughter. He knows he's not close but wants the same relationship. You both suck."]}
