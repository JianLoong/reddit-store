In this instance, I think it's a terrible idea. You're paying Mary for something that Julie has been doing without incentive, because you are desperate to define \"success\" as \"graduating with a 3.5 GPA\". That's not \"success\". \"Success\" looks different for every child. \n\nFurther, giving Mary money for grades probably means that she'll burn through that money and when it's gone, she'll just want more. \n\nWhat is this really teaching Mary? Nothing. You feel sorry for her because her parents died. That's understandable. But giving her a huge sum of money because of it just isn't the right play here.", "YTA. Your offer to bribe Mary to graduate isn't solving anything. The root of the problem likely is that Mary is not a good student and that in turn makes her unmotivated. The root of the problem is not that she needs $100k to frivolously spend so that you, in turn, encourage a 17 yr old who barely graduated high school to learn terrible financial lesson (i.e. she can't (afford) buy a house - she doesn't have a job, money or credit), she should not buy a car she can't afford, etc.", "Yta, you\u2019re basically punishing your daughter for being a good student. Once your daughter brought up how the deal is unfair you should have started trying to figure out how to reward her as well for her hard work. \n\nAlso, youre not fixing the issue with Mary, you\u2019re just throwing money at it. Have you talked to her therapist to see how you guys can support her?", "yta. this type of shit leads to having a daughter who moves out asap and cuts you out, or who quietly builds more and more resentment for you. \n\nshe works HARD for her gpa. you mentioned youre well off. pay for her damn college if youre paying for someone elses whos not even your kid.", "YTA - you are offering Mary free money for doing what Julie is doing.  You are thinking it's automatic that Julie will succeed without looking at everything SHE has done to get there.  Julie is busting her ass but to you, that's expected?  You need to either pull back on the offer to Julie or at least offer something to YOUR OWN DAUGHTER for her success instead of just expecting her to.

I've never subscribed to the notion that different kids with different needs should be subjected to the same expectations or the same treatment.\n\nThe reason I think you're an AH (a mild, well-intentioned one) is that you're assuming that Mary's problem is solely lack of motivation when there could be a number of other causes.  If she also has a learning difficulty, or depression, interpersonal problems at school, or who knows what else, even a million dollars won't get you the result you want.\n\nYou may need to change your top priority from helping her achieve academic success to helping her get mentally healthy and happy again, even if it means that she takes an extra year or two to graduate.\n\nStop trying to throw money at the problem, Aunty, and take a step back. Try to figure out what the big picture is.", "YTA you should be paying for a tutor and a therapist", "YTA, this is unfair and will make your daughter hostile towards both you and her cousin.

From what you\u2019ve described, Mary may not have the academic skills to succeed at a 3.5 level and certainly has no skills to manage that much money if she does. You also should have at least advised your husband before making such a substantial offer, and could have proactively talked to your daughter about why your goals for Mary are more limited. You should also be thinking more about guiding Mary beyond her diploma; a listless, unmotivated and unsupported teenager with six figures of play money is a recipe for serious trouble.", "You need to offer the same deal to your daughter.

It\u2019s not favoritism at all. Your daughter lives with you, didn\u2019t lose her parents, and isn\u2019t battling depression. It sounds like your daughter isn\u2019t aware how privileged she actually is, to grow up in a loving home, with enough money, stability and chances to build a future for herself, in contrast to your niece, who clearly needs a stepping stone. You could ask your daughter if she wants to live with your mother, same budget for clothes and extracurriculars, and then ask her if she wants the same deal as her cousin. Tell her what you told us, that she gets money by means of education and that she\u2019s not in competition with her cousin. It\u2019s not free money for your niece; she has to improve herself a lot to get the money to build her life; in contrast to your daughter; for her it would be free money for she\u2019s already there. \n\nIf she understands, you can still come up with a nice arrangement to give her some spending money when she graduates, but she\u2019s 16 not 6, so she should get the difference of her cousin getting a one time break, verses you and your husband who will be there for her to pick her up whenever she needs. Fair doesn\u2019t have to equal equal. \n\nGood luck!", "I don't want to give an actual judgment because this is such a heartbreaking situation you're all in but I don't think you're handling this wisely snd I don't think Julie is handling this with any compassion. \n\nFirst about you- I may be wrong because we only have what you've said in your post, but it seems to me that you're just throwing solutions (that you deem are acceptable) at Mary without asking or paying any attention to what she wants or needs. Also, if she succeeds in maintaining those grades, then you are honour bound to give her the amount promised. Not doing so would make you an AH and yet you should never have made a promise like that because that's too large a sum of money to be given to a bare minimum adult like that. \n\nJulie- I don't agree with the y t a comments that are saying you're offering Mary an incentive for doing something Julie already does. No Julie already doesn't do it. The situations would be similar only if Julie also lost both her parents and then *still* continued to maintain her good grades. If Mary obtains and maintains the grades you want her to, she would be doing it *on top of losing her parents tragically*. It's not the same at all. Julie seems to have no compassion for the fact that her cousin is an orphan.", "YTA  honestly this just seems like people who view money differently, to you hoarding money is not important, money is a tool to you, you are not as emotionally invested in such a substantial amount because to you it is easily replaceable. But to someone who may not ever see that amount of money in one instance, let alone to be able to see that amount as a simple bargaining chip, things are not going to line up. To you, you are using the money as a tool for motivation, you\u2019re not very attached to it and the projected outcome to you is worth much more than the money. to your daughter however, you are handing a literal life changing amount of money to her underperforming cousin for something that she has already done and is very capable of, so to her, why doesn\u2019t she also get this life changing money? Sure she gets to appreciate the wealth you and your husband have amassed, but it\u2019s not hers nor has any been promised for her discretion. I get why you did it, but I also get why your daughter is upset. I\u2019m not saying you should strip the cousin of this opportunity, but I do think you should give your daughter some sort of monetary deal she can work towards similarly to the cousin but maybe not as much since you\u2019re already paying for college.

She could have the same freedom to use that money that Mary does without disincentivizing her college.", "NTA.   Your poor niece lost her parents to an accident when she was all of 12 years old.  I cannot begin to imagine how devastating that was for her.  You're doing whatever you have to do to support her and get her back on track.

Don\u2019t you think that would reflect more on your parenting than her \u201csinful\u201d choice? Correct me if I\u2019m wrong, but if you did your job as a parent wouldn\u2019t you trust your daughter not to make that choice?", "Yeah.  But let's be honest, the daughter won the life lottery.  She has two high earning parents and she's able to achieve a 4.0 (even if it's through hard work, she can get there).\n\nIt's incumbent on parents in these situations to not only encourage high achievement, but also empathy and an understanding of privilege.  I'm happy to be downvoted, this is just my opinion.", "OP could also point out that Julie is likely to get more money from them in the future.", "Well, it isn't fair to Mary that her parents are dead. This is a one off lump sum. Julie is going to have living, we'll off, supportive parents for a long time to come.", "I am trying my hardest to avoid that. I don't want to imagine that scenario, to be honest. \n\nBut as per our agreement, anything else she wants to do other than college will have to be on her dime.", "I will have to talk to my husband. But with the wedding fund we are saving for her, it might be tight.", "She does, she has high grades. And she is their daughter.", "I don't disagree. But, I don't think the daughter is seeing the scenario maturely.  I am a lot harsher with my own kids about the realities of finance. \"I provide you with everything and so I am impatient with the idea that you so take that for granted you want to decide what I can give someone else. That's childish of you thinking you get a vote. I've got you more than covered. But, I'm not debating who else might deserve some help from me. Its not your money.\"", "Yeah, it still doesn't change that op is the asshole here. Just because someone had a tragedy doesn't mean other people don't matter.", "So where does it end? It's not fair that Mary's parents are dead, so she gets $100K. When that's gone, what next? Free money for the rest of her life, because her parents are dead? \n\nThis isn't Mary gets her parents' life insurance and Julie doesn't. This is Mary gets her aunt's money for doing something she should have been doing anyway, while Julie doesn't get her own mother's money for doing the exact same thing.", "Something about your posts just sounds\u2026 gross?\n\nLots of successful people who didn\u2019t go to college. You make it sound like she\u2019d be turning to a life of crime or something.", "So Mary can use the money for WHATEVER but your daughter can only use the money for college. How is that fair?", "It doesn\u2019t matter if don\u2019t want to imagine it, it\u2019s a very real possibility that you need to prepare for. \n\nYour \u201cdeal\u201d will likely come up in conversation for the rest of your life and theirs. You offered your niece the same deal your daughter has and then changed it likely hoping your daughter would find out later rather than sooner. Your wants and expectations are trumping the reality of the entire situation.", "Yeah that\u2019s not fair toward your daughter. I see why she is mad if you have money to spare for your niece but not your daughter. \nWhat happens if your daughter gets merit based scholarships?", "See bad parent!!!  Your daughter will leave you and good for her.", "I don\u2019t think you realize that you are risking demotivating your daughter by effectively rewarding her cousin for underachieving. In the long-term, your daughter is likely to be better off getting a college degree paid for than getting cash in hand at 18 or 19, but she is going to see her cousin handed a wad of cash to do with as she pleases.\n\nIn your shoes, whatever sum I had to give as a reward for graduating would be earnable by both girls and weighted towards college.\n\nFor example, if you have $60,000 to give, each girl could get $10,000 for graduating high school with the required GPA, and $20,000 for college.", "Again. Bad parent!", "Then what's the problem??? \ud83e\udd14", "I'm not saying Julie doesn't matter, I'm saying Julie gets ongoing support from her parents--and will benefit from their estate in time. She and Mary aren't in the same situation", "Well its kind of hard to stay motivated in high school when both your parents die when you\u2019re aged 12. Sometimes money is only thing that motivates kids.", "OP hasn't said 'I'll give her money forever'. OP has said she will give her this money, once. \n\nAnd Mary has had more to overcome than Julie.", "Mary doesn't care about college. Look, she is a kid who won't care if I lock her up in her room for the rest of her life. She has checked out that much. \n \nWe have tried counselling and therapy. \n\nI am hoping the dollar signs atleast make her try a bit. Try to get her life back.", "She will still get the money. As a bonus.", "That her cousin gets the money *without* having good grades and gets to do whatever she wants with it. And she, who actually is their daughter, has to earn that money and can only use it for college.", "And how does this changes the fact that op is unfair to her daughter?", "Again. Mary can use the money for anything. Your daughter can only use money for college, if she doesn't then she doesn't get anything. How is that fair?", "But your niece gets the money no matter what. I will say your making sure your daughter acts up. I know this would have made me lose motivation and act up so good luck to you. Just keep in mind this will effect your relationship with your daughter and it won\u2019t be the same", ">gets the money without having good grades\n\nYou need good grades to maintain a 3.5 or higher GPA. \ud83d\ude06\ud83d\ude06\ud83d\ude06", "I don't think OP is unfair. Julie has more advantages and opportunities than Mary.", "You need better grades to have a 4 GPA (at least from what i understand, i'm not in america ). And again, julie is her daughter. She is allowed to be unfair to other people's kids, but not to her daughter.", "But ~~mary~~ julie is her actual kid.", "Being someone's daughter doesn't entitle you to any of their money. OP can give her niece her entire fortune and her daughter wouldn't be able to do anything about it. \ud83d\ude06\n\n4.0 = Straight As\n3.5 = B+ to As", "No, Julie is her kid. Mary is her orphan niece who OP says inherited nothing from her parents."]}
