In this instance, I think it's a terrible idea. You're paying Mary for something that Julie has been doing without incentive, because you are desperate to define \"success\" as \"graduating with a 3.5 GPA\". That's not \"success\". \"Success\" looks different for every child. \n\nFurther, giving Mary money for grades probably means that she'll burn through that money and when it's gone, she'll just want more. \n\nWhat is this really teaching Mary? Nothing. You feel sorry for her because her parents died. That's understandable. But giving her a huge sum of money because of it just isn't the right play here.", "YTA. Your offer to bribe Mary to graduate isn't solving anything. The root of the problem likely is that Mary is not a good student and that in turn makes her unmotivated. The root of the problem is not that she needs $100k to frivolously spend so that you, in turn, encourage a 17 yr old who barely graduated high school to learn terrible financial lesson (i.e. she can't (afford) buy a house - she doesn't have a job, money or credit), she should not buy a car she can't afford, etc.", "Yta, you\u2019re basically punishing your daughter for being a good student. Once your daughter brought up how the deal is unfair you should have started trying to figure out how to reward her as well for her hard work. \n\nAlso, youre not fixing the issue with Mary, you\u2019re just throwing money at it. Have you talked to her therapist to see how you guys can support her?", "yta. this type of shit leads to having a daughter who moves out asap and cuts you out, or who quietly builds more and more resentment for you. \n\nshe works HARD for her gpa. you mentioned youre well off. pay for her damn college if youre paying for someone elses whos not even your kid.", "YTA - you are offering Mary free money for doing what Julie is doing.  You are thinking it's automatic that Julie will succeed without looking at everything SHE has done to get there.  Julie is busting her ass but to you, that's expected?

I've never subscribed to the notion that different kids with different needs should be subjected to the same expectations or the same treatment.\n\nThe reason I think you're an AH (a mild, well-intentioned one) is that you're assuming that Mary's problem is solely lack of motivation when there could be a number of other causes.  If she also has a learning difficulty, or depression, interpersonal problems at school, or who knows what else, even a million dollars won't get you the result you want.\n\nYou may need to change your top priority from helping her achieve academic success to helping her get mentally healthy and happy again, even if it means that she takes an extra year or two to graduate.\n\nStop trying to throw money at the problem, Aunty, and take a step back.

From what you\u2019ve described, Mary may not have the academic skills to succeed at a 3.5 level and certainly has no skills to manage that much money if she does. You also should have at least advised your husband before making such a substantial offer, and could have proactively talked to your daughter about why your goals for Mary are more limited. You should also be thinking more about guiding Mary beyond her diploma; a listless, unmotivated and unsupported teenager with six figures of play money is a recipe for serious trouble.", "You need to offer the same deal to your daughter.

It\u2019s not favoritism at all. Your daughter lives with you, didn\u2019t lose her parents, and isn\u2019t battling depression. It sounds like your daughter isn\u2019t aware how privileged she actually is, to grow up in a loving home, with enough money, stability and chances to build a future for herself, in contrast to your niece, who clearly needs a stepping stone. You could ask your daughter if she wants to live with your mother, same budget for clothes and extracurriculars, and then ask her if she wants the same deal as her cousin. Tell her what you told us, that she gets money by means of education and that she\u2019s not in competition with her cousin. It\u2019s not free money for your niece; she has to improve herself a lot to get the money to build her life; in contrast to your daughter; for her it would be free money for she\u2019s already there. \n\nIf she understands, you can still come up with a nice arrangement to give her some spending money when she graduates, but she\u2019s 16 not 6, so she should get the difference of her cousin getting a one time break, verses you and your husband who will be there for her to pick her up whenever she needs. Fair doesn\u2019t have to equal equal. \n\nGood luck!", "I don't want to give an actual judgment because this is such a heartbreaking situation you're all in but I don't think you're handling this wisely snd I don't think Julie is handling this with any compassion. \n\nFirst about you- I may be wrong because we only have what you've said in your post, but it seems to me that you're just throwing solutions (that you deem are acceptable) at Mary without asking or paying any attention to what she wants or needs. Also, if she succeeds in maintaining those grades, then you are honour bound to give her the amount promised. Not doing so would make you an AH and yet you should never have made a promise like that because that's too large a sum of money to be given to a bare minimum adult like that. \n\nJulie- I don't agree with the y t a comments that are saying you're offering Mary an incentive for doing something Julie already does. No Julie already doesn't do it. The situations would be similar only if Julie also lost both her parents and then *still* continued to maintain her good grades. If Mary obtains and maintains the grades you want her to, she would be doing it *on top of losing her parents tragically*. It's not the same at all. Julie seems to have no compassion for the fact that her cousin is an orphan.", "YTA  honestly this just seems like people who view money differently, to you hoarding money is not important, money is a tool to you, you are not as emotionally invested in such a substantial amount because to you it is easily replaceable. But to someone who may not ever see that amount of money in one instance, let alone to be able to see that amount as a simple bargaining chip, things are not going to line up. To you, you are using the money as a tool for motivation, you\u2019re not very attached to it and the projected outcome to you is worth much more than the money. to your daughter however, you are handing a literal life changing amount of money to her underperforming cousin for something that she has already done and is very capable of, so to her, why doesn\u2019t she also get this life changing money? Sure she gets to appreciate the wealth you and your husband have amassed, but it\u2019s not hers nor has any been promised for her discretion. I get why you did it, but I also get why your daughter is upset. I\u2019m not saying you should strip the cousin of this opportunity, but I do think you should give your daughter some sort of monetary deal she can work towards similarly to the cousin but maybe not as much since you\u2019re already paying for college.

Sure, she could also ruin her life (a bit more than becoming an orphan so young has already ruined it), but given that she\u2019s not even his kid and was never a great student, forcing her hand to go to a college she doesn\u2019t want to attend or get nothing from the family in terms of financial help as she enters adulthood doesn\u2019t seem prudent.\n\nOn the other hand, his daughter does actually want to attend college and has the aptitude to do so, so I can understand his worry of her choosing cash over tuition derailing her perfectly fine life if he makes the same offer.\n\nMary has very little to lose at this point however, and so much could be gained from this offer\u2014not only in the cash value and potential experiences, but also from graduating\u2014 that it would be beyond cruel to rescind it simply because the daughter is being made a different (and in the eyes of many here, apparently lesser??) offer.\n\nAnd, to everyone saying one shouldn\u2019t buy grades, I\u2019m personally of the mind that if it works it works; and frankly, saying I\u2019ll pay you if you work harder is not unlike the jobs many of us are beholden to, where we\u2019re paid to show up and do the work\u2014 and then get incremental raises when we work harder (or smarter, or longer, etc).", "What if her kid gets a scholarship?? If I were their daughter I would tell them I want them to give me cash for every dollar I saved them with my good grades.", "I struggled with a lesser version of this growing up. I was a straight A student while my sister failed a few classes and got generally bad grades. So occasionally my mom would come up with rewards for my sister if she got good grades. I was not offered any of the rewards. I was also never praised for my grades. I was proud of my grades once and I\u2019ll never forget my mother using that moment to tell me \u201cyour sister would be smarter than you if she just applied herself\u201d. Thanks mom. Way to ruin the one thing I was proud of myself for.", "Having a 3.5 GPA doesn't make someone a better human.", "8k a few years ago? Where?

Say she does graduate, get a job, etc without healing from that trauma - and then, like trauma usually does, it comes back to haunt her even worse, later in life when she's grown up and has even less support. Not to mention how she's clearly not \"on track\" already. It's better to deal with that stuff before it warps your mental health and self esteem for life, even if it means delaying socially expected milestones for a couple years.", "So where did you go to college and when?", ">If money cured depression rich people would kill themselves less.\n\nThis should be highlighted more.\n\nOP is only going to cause her niece's death.\n\nWhether it is overdose or crashing the brand new sports car she bought thanks to OP.\n\nMoney + depression = not a good combination."]}
