My partner would have had to be restrained from murdering that doctor with their bare hands.", "[deleted]", "This. Medical malpractice is one of the most difficult and most expensive types of cases to win for a number of reasons, and you\u2019re wasting time and money if you aren\u2019t using an attorney with extensive practice in the area. It is also generally not an area of practice for a small firm. When you have to prove actual damages by the doctor - as in something happened that could have been prevented with proper care - it can be *tricky.*\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean OP shouldn\u2019t get a consult, but I always warn people it\u2019s not something to get their hopes up over and it is likely not worth the stress unless there was a serious direct injury involved. \n\nI would *definitely* report to the board and any hospital that the doctor has privileges at though.", "I suppose a lawyer may be able to help decide that, but she definitely needs to be reported at the very least. OB\u2019s next mother to be may not be so lucky", "True, and IANAL, but I would think the requests for lab results and potential lack of follow up and communication with patient might be a good place to start.", "Yes, they would have still happened, but there could have been a plan in place, people at the ready to handle the situation, etc instead of scrambling once issues arose. That is why typically a kid with a certain defect, in which other defects are common, have plans and notify delivery team beforehand.", "Bad bot", "also how does he think theyre going to be able to afford the mistakes teh doctor made?", "Stuff like this happens more than you think. My OB with my oldest almost costed us both of our lives because she kept dismissing my blood pressure then kept saying nothing was wrong with my child... her cord was wrapped around her neck. The ultrasound tech and her never told me. If I wasn't feeling super sick and dizzy and went in the attending ob wouldn't have caught my pre-eclampsia. I had to have her that day. My blood pressure was at stroke level. My ob missed the birth then wanted to catch an attitude with me because everything resulted in a emergency c-section to save me and my daughter. I wasn't the only mom she dismissed with these issues even after multiple lawsuits she still has her license. Just moved to a different county and hospital.", "This absolutely happens. Women die because of this shit. Seriously, do some reading\u2026", "Given the rates of maternal mortality in the US for example and the entirely of the 2x chromosome subreddit, I'd beg to differ.", "A doctor tried to convince me that the vomiting spells I was suffering from was from pregnancy. The fact I repeatedly told him I was a virgin and that it had BEEN GOING ON FOR SIX FUCKING YEARS and was getting WORSE did not matter. He was 110% convinced I was pregnant. Even ordered an abdominal ultrasound to prove it. \n\nSpoiler alert, I wasn't pregnant, I have a fucked up esophagus (initially during biopsy they thought it was advanced stage cancer; luckily it's not. But that's how not normal my esophagus looks) and was having runs of acute acidosis. Which, when uncontrolled and outside of a medical setting, is often fatal. If I hadn't been willing to shout at him and force him to do further tests and get his head out of his ass, it probably would have killed me. \n\nWith meds, I lead a happy life and barely have any issues anymore. But it took a hell of a fight to get here. Doctors can absolutely be pompous jerks and absolutely not listen to their patients and miss critical things.", "Happens all the time in women's health care. Women get ignored all the time by healthcare professionals. A lot of them have huge egos and refuse to believe that they can be wrong. Not to say there aren't a lot of great doctors out there, but there are some crappy ones out there. It does exist and it does happen.", "What do you call the dumbest person in an OB class?

Your hubs is a lot of things I can't say if he thinks you are.", "Right? Let's talk about the fact that more than 80% of deaths in the US due to pregnancy complications are PREVENTABLE. 80 fucking percent could have been avoided. 80% of those kids growing up without their mom wouldn't have to. But hey, the system is totally fine.", "[deleted]", "Yeah, you\u2019d hope so. But there have been stories rather recently about doctors that have been getting away with shit like this for years.", "You would think so but I've running into my share of doctors that are completely incompetent and they are just allowed to do whatever they want. I had a painful medical diagnosis ignored for 11 years by multiple doctors and then just recently I had a doctor who prescribed a medication that was completely inappropriate for a medical issue I was having that is probably going to take close to a year to fix because of her stupidity and when I complained to the state I just got Tee hee!", "I see you dont know any doctors", "I ended up in OB emergency at 36 weeks pregnant due to bleeding. The doctor there said I was in labor and told me that it was my water breaking. They pumped me full of pitocin that never took for 24 hours until another doctor came and told me she was putting fluid in to see if that would help. When she reached in she discovered a full sac and broke it. (Later I found out excess blood is a top cause for a false test that your water broke.) Then she left the room while I finished dilating and when I told a nurse it was time and that the baby was coming she told me to hold my baby in until the doctor came. (Later I found out that could have had devastating effects, from brain damage to death.) Incompetent medical professionals definitely exist. I wish it weren't the case.", "[deleted]", "Where did I say all doctors are idiots? And I didn't claim anything, I asked for something and you couldn't provide it so I was just reflecting on that."]}
