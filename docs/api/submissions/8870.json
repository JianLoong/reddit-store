Appointments were always rushed, I had to beg to get normal pregnancy labs, and had to beg to get the results. I got the anatomy scan at 20 weeks along (it looks at all the baby\u2019s organs and limbs to make sure baby is developing at a normal pace) but after it was done I had to ask the doctor to give me the results. All the way up to 37 weeks she would write me off and say \u201cbaby\u2019s heart sounds good. I\u2019m not worried\u201d but I was and I had a feeling that something was off. And it was. At time of delivery my OB missed the delivery and walked in 5 minutes after. My baby was born with a cleft lip, heart murmur, hearing loss, and the delivery itself was traumatic. Baby got stuck, heart rate dropped, and the team were screaming for the NICU. Baby was born with an obvious cleft lip. When the doctor walked in, she tried getting in my face because I refused to look at her. She even stated \u201clook at me. I\u2019m talking to you\u201d and I told the stand in OB to get her out of my room. \n\nAfter going home, I requested all of the tests and the scans and found out that the Ultrasonographer noted the cleft lip on the results. Extra tests are supposed to be done on babies with cleft because other birth defects are commonly associated with it. Also, the hospital should be informed before delivery so that they can prepare baby needs assistance. Anyways, we were discharged and sent home. 6 weeks go by and my post labor appointment is came up. So I called to schedule with a different doctor. It wasn\u2019t a problem. But as I was waiting in the room for the new doctor the OB came in and asked why I didn\u2019t want to be seen by her. And I state \u201cI couldn\u2019t get quality care when I was pregnant, so I\u2019m not seeing you now that I have a choice on who I can see*. Please leave. You\u2019re being inappropriate\u201d she left. My husband thinks that I was being an ass.

I would report those OBGYN to all relevant medical boards, the hospital they have admitting privileges to.\n\n I'd also tell your husband to shut it. This doctor's negligence in your and your baby's care may have resulted in worse health outcomes for both of you than if she had addressed these things like she was supposed to.

No! \n\nMedical care and the healthcare systems are designed to take care of as many people as possible as reasonably well as they can. It is not the best care for each individual patient.
