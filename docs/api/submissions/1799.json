You are generous to be renting out the house.", "Tell them to pay for their own kids", "Gma already set the tradition and you are fulfilling it with the couple of hundred dollars.  and if you were to twist the rules the way they want you'd have to give the ones who used Gmas's house 2 hundred bucks.  That's not the deal.  Everyone has their own choice: go study at Watsamata U. or Anyware College.  There are more pluses to Watsamata U, but its still their choice if they feel Anyware is worth paying more for expenses\n\nNTA", "NTA", "Happy Cake Day!", "NTA\n\nI think it\u2019s wonderfully kind that you\u2019re continuing to let family members live in the house. That, in NO WAY, obligates you to do anything else.", "You are NTA. What entitlement our family has! No, just do what you are willing to do. If they complain, tell them you will just rent to someone else/other students for market cost.", "NTA. You were left a house, that you are kind enough to share. You weren't left a trust fund to share. If your family wants to pay for other housing, they should absolutely that. But you simply don't have the means to do so. So when people complain, just keep repeating that you do not have the means to help with a cash housing fund. Suggest that someone start a housing fund that the family can contribute to, as they are able. Other than that, let it go. They can be upset that they missed the gravy train, but it is what it is. Your grandmother was a blessing to so many and your home will continue to bless other family members.", "What a bunch users!\n\nYou are trying to carry on the tradition and their response is 'give me more.'\n\nMy advice? Send out a mass mailing to your family that gives the same offer, and says 'ever so sorry, but due to my financial circumstances, I cannot offer more. Good luck to you all.\n\nThen ignore their crap, because they are being greedy assholes.", "NTA. Stick to what you want/can do and ignore all the noise.\n\nYou're choosing to do a really nice thing in memory of your grandmother's legacy. This does not mean you are obligated to replace her for others, especially just money-wise.\n\nThose are just greedy guilt-trippers with some really whacked expectations.", "INFO: Did grandmother leave any other assets? Are you the only person who inherited from the grandmother?", "NTA not your kid not your problem. entitlement Is strong with that one.", "Hell no, you are absolutely NTA! You didn't do anything wrong. She's just behaving extremely rude, disrespectful, entitled, and well.... I can't say what else without getting in trouble. \ud83d\udc40     \n\n You don't owe anyone anything. Your grandma left the house solely to *YOU*! You, and you alone, are the  one who has chosen to continue the \"college housing tradition\"! Why? Simply out of the goodness of your own heart. So, no, in absolutely no are you an a-hole for not being able to fund a cousin's housing bill at an entirely different college! I'm fact, I'm not sure why she thinks you should send her any money, at all, when anyone staying in the house itself, has to pay rent while they're staying in it???! Right, didn't I read that correctly, they're paying a reduced rent!????", "NTA. \"I am not your grandmother.\"", "NTA. Your cousin gets an award for sheer gall, though. You are a very generous cousin!\n\nYou might ask Old Greedyguts there how s/he will feel if you, instead---in order to be totally fair---DON'T rent the cottage to local college-going cousins, but open it to the public charging market-rate rent, which goes in your pocket. Tell OG you will let the whole family know that the reason for your decision was OG's demand.", "NTA:\nI\u2019d be tempted to say,\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid she left me the house, but not enough money to fund anyone else\u2019s l college expenses. The only way I could do that would be to raise the rent for the people who are staying here while they are at college, so that everyone is paying equally.\u201d\nThat way, it\u2019ll hit them in the pocket, and you should at least get the rest of the cousins on side?", "File this one under \"no good deed goes unpunished\".  \n\nIf you had not said anything to the family, would they (the four remaining cousins not yet of college age and their parents) have brought up this issue?  Would that cousin currently at another school have contacted you if you hadn't made this announcement?"]}
