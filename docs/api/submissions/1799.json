She (my grandmother) made rent equal to expenses + a bit extra to cover regular maintenance; it was a stellar deal for college, and it holds a lot of fond memories--I feel very fortunate to have received this house and intend on continuing her legacy with the space. I have told my family (there are 4 remaining cousins who are not college aged yet), that I intend on continuing renting the house out at cost to family members if they chose to pursue a degree at the college where this house is located (or if they choose to take a job in the area during their \"college age years\").\n\nHere is where the dilemma comes in, when I made this announcement, I received a call from a cousin who is currently attending a different college that is nowhere near the home I inherited. She wanted to know how much I intended on sending her for her housing when she moved off campus next fall--as my grandmother did give some money to her grandchildren who chose not to go to college where the house was (not nearly enough to make the deal that the house was, but from my understanding it was equal to a couple hundred dollars a month). And when I told her I was not planning on sending ANY money for her housing, she went off screaming that I was disgracing my grandmother's legacy and that she would have wanted me to fulfill the entire legacy of college housing generosity. \n\nI am not a wealthy person--I did not receive any money in the inheritance -- just the house. And even that, I have had to spend a fair amount of money in repairs to get the home back to prime condition as non-family tenants had moved out during her passing and they took advantage of the lack of supervision during the legal red tape surrounding the house. I told her that even if I wanted to fulfill the whole legacy, I didn't have the money and that that was it. Now I have family members calling stating that I am now forcing their children to choose this school near the house, when everyone else got to choose.

If grandma wanted them to have money, she would have left it to them. They are being entitled as fuck. At this point I wouldn\u2019t let them have use of the house either after all this. You\u2019re not responsible for someone\u2019s choice of schools.", "NTA.\n\nYou are carrying on the part of the tradition that she left to you, period.  If your grandmother wanted you to send your cousins money, she needed to leave you a bank account of money with which to do it.\n\nAfter the repairs are paid off, if you are actually making money off the house, you can revisit using that money to restart that other part, but that's clearly not happening right now.", "NTA. This is not your problem. If they want to live off campus at a different school, they are responsible for covering those costs. Period.", "NTA\n\nYour cousin wanted to use your logic on continuing your grandmas tradition back on you. It\u2019s your house though you can do whatever you want.

You absolute monster! /s\n\nNTA.", "NTA! Awww, poor pampered baby, can't live off campus like an entitled brat. Same goes for everyone else and their entitled children.

Ok, first of all, trying to guilt-trip somebody into being \"generous\" is so massively messed up, I don't even know where to start, so I'll just leave it at that. \n\nAlso, what's hard to understand here? If Grandma left you no money, how is it your job to look after your entire family? The family members \"calling you out\" for it should be reminded that they are welcome to honor grandma's legacy by pitching in for those that do not wish to study where you are located. Pretty sure they will be discovering a different perspective after that. What else can you do?

It was if you happen to need housing where my property is located I'll let you stay. Now they're complaining you won't  house them nationwide.  That's beyond poor manners and stupidity  even.\n\nIf they persist in making demands thats costly, retract the offer. You can live in home yourself or rent it out with a clear conscious.", "NTA...your grandmother had the money you don't and if your granny wanted you to keep doing this she would have given you money to do so.

Why would you be obligated to take over your grandmother's policy on supporting her grandchildren just because you inherited a house? Frankly, you're already going above and beyond by allowing the cheap rent if they live there in the first place - I'd be renting it for profit or selling it. \n\nWhere are the parents, aunts and uncles in this equation to provide financial support? I'm baffled that a cousin would be the person who is decided as best person to do so and presumably you're not the only person who benefitted off the deal your grandmother gave over the years.\n\nNTA and if I was you I would resolve the situation of forcing your cousins to choose by revoking the offer of subsidised housing entirely and doing as you please with your inheritance.", "NTA, the offer was good only for a specific community, not an entitlement to those who choose to seek higher education elsewhere.", "NTA.

It\u2019s not your responsibility. Carrying in her legacy is different. She could afford to help the other grandkid\u2019s, you can\u2019t. Clearly the circumstances are different and your family is idiotic to expect that you do as they command.", "NTA 100%..... redirect them to whomever received the money part of the inheritance!!!", "NTA. Let the entitled parents of these entitled cousins used the inheritance they got from their mother to pay for the housing costs. You\u2019re already going above and beyond by keeping your grandmother\u2019s deal for providing housing in place.  Most people would have just sold the house and let everyone else figure it out themselves. Which is an option that you may want to keep on the table if your family\u2019s nonsense continues.", "NTA  \n\n Do not feel guilty for not providing relatives housing beyond making the inherited house available to those who will be attending the nearby college.  \n\n\nYou're not forcing anyone to go to that college.   All they're looking for is for someone - anyone to pay for their housing.     This wasn't the deal your grandmother set up and they have no right to anything beyond the arrangement she had already had going. \n\nYou're being generous continuing the legacy of your grandmother.   You don't have to do that, but you are, and your family is trying to take advantage of you.", "NTA. Perfect example of no good deed goes unpunished. Send out a mass email saying people are being unreasonable - and these they know who they are- and since they are badgering you for money you don\u2019t have/isn\u2019t theirs to pay for lodging in other towns or they think that you\u2019re forcing their kids to go to the school near the house, you are selling it for x and if they want to buy it contact your lawyer. If no one wants it you are still selling and to not dare ask for any money because you are using for your kids/home/vacation/retirement. Tell them all to pound sand.\n\nI think while grandma\u2019s intentions were good selling it will unload a massive burden.

I assume there was no stipulation that you continue to offer it reduced rent to your other relatives. Owning that house does not make your the family ATM. You chose to do that out of the kindness of your heart. In response, your family is acting like a bunch of entitled AHs. \n\nI get that the ones already in college picked those colleges assuming they would have support from grandma for housing. But if your grandmother wanted to continue that legacy, she needed to have accounted for that in her will. Since you got the house, I assume her other assets (cash, etc.) went to others. If they want to guilt someone into continuing the cash assistance legacy, then they need to look to the people who received CASH inheritances. I am guessing the relatives with children received cash inheritances and that your grandmother intended them to use this for their children's education. \n\nIf I were you, I would take back the housing offer at your property entirely. Tell them they all ruined it for themselves.", "NTA", "NTA. I'm glad you want to stick with the house for college students and that's more than enough. Just because your grandmother gave her GRANDCHILDREN money for college, doesn't mean you have to. Like in what universe do you have the responsibility for that?

If your grandmother would have left you a huge amount of money to pay for your cousins' expenses then I would understand them, but like this? \n\nHonestly the AUDACITY of them to even ask for it \ud83d\udc80 What do they want you to do?
