But here are the facts. The house grandmother left me is in X College Town. She only left me the house and no additional funds. That means that all future costs around the house: maintenance, upgrades, insurance, taxes, and incidentals, is now coming directly out of my pocket and out of any rental income from the property. As an example, the last tenants, who weren't family, caused damages during the period of grandmother's probate and didn't cover them when they left. That came out of my pocket. \n\nI do not personally have the money to do as grandmother did for cousins attending elsewhere. My goal was to keep going to part of her legacy that I could, to the best of my ability. If the family is going to be absolutely hateful and ungrateful to me over it, I don't have to do that. I can rent the house out to people who aren't family, or sell it and keep the money, and everyone can handle their own housing as they see fit.
