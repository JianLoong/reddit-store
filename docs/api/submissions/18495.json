This type of mindset *might* (maybe) have been cute in high school, but in his late 20's, this ain't it. He thinks she went out and spent a fortune on a menagerie of lingerie just for him? He's lucky she's dressing up sexy to begin with. Lord knows a lot of that isn't super comfy. \nNTA, OP. His comments are pretty possessive and diminutive though, big red flags.
