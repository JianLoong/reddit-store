And I'm laughing my ass off at her characterization of Great Wolf Lodge as a \"kid's resort.\" We had our annual holiday party at the one in the Dells one year. It is most definitely NOT a kid's resort. Yes, there's a water park, but there's plenty of other things to do. There's a couple of restaurants in there I can't see anyone in their right mind going to with kids. Suites with hot tubs. Yeah, that's just for kids /s", "Nta.

Why does she think she's entitled to stay in your house when she feels like it, why does she refer to your home as \"the house\"?

First, she *erases* you from your home (THE house), then firehoses you with accusations, and at last, refuses to talk about the issues with you. \n\nAnyways, if I was you, I'd see their actions in a similar light to a dementia patient - neither can control the chaotic shenanigans they're up to, but both can be managed to a certain extent (limiting contact, having boundaries, antipsychotics, etc).\n\nWhat is your husband's take on the situation?

Does your husband have your back on this?", "I'd take it as a win and an opportunity to let your husband, MIL, and  SIL know that SIL will stay with MIL for all future trips.

Me, my hubby, daughter, SIL, her hubby and their parents. We all agreed together that we\u2019d spend a night at GWL for my daughter\u2019s bday. Then the SIL changed their plans. Aunt of the year too, might I add.", "Because of the family dynamics. If he\u2019s the one upsetting his sister then his parents get involved and hound him.  \nHe\u2019s talked to her for me before and she legit said \u201cwhere is this coming from?!

Why is that always an excuse for the worst people to impose on you?\n\nOn one hand, you have peace of mind and a happy life (because they're never around). On the other, you have some relatives mad at you (because you banned them from visiting). Who wouldn't prefer the former? Yes, it complicates Christmas and Thanksgiving. But, again, so what? Isn't freedom from this domineering cheat worth it?\n\nAnd I wonder why you bothered to text her when she was busy flouncing around in a fury after hearing the word no. So what if she's furious? Why does this matter?\n\nYou should consider, too, that in this computerized age, your home address is now on file in Costco's rogues gallery and could eventually get you into trouble, not only with Costco but other such stores as well.
