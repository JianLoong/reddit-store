This time for her 40th, my daughters 5th and my MIL 65th bdays all within 10 days of eachother.  My daughter wanted 1 thing for her bday- to go to great wolf lodge. So as a family we all agreed to go for her. I found a 40% code and booked 2 nights out of the 8 that they would be in town.  \nAfter a few weeks my MIL tells my husband that they all will just come to Great Wolf for a day but that my SIL and husband didn\u2019t want to stay at a kids resort. Later, we called my SIL to discuss the plans and I asked if they planned on staying with their parents since we\u2019d be out of town. She replied with \u201cno, we are staying at THE house.\u201d (You mean, mine and my husbands house?). I told her I was uncomfortable with the thought of anyone staying in our home when we aren\u2019t there. \nA few days later, she calls my husband and goes off. Saying I don\u2019t trust them, I always pull this shit, why can\u2019t I ever be happy. And they canceled their trip. When I txt her to try to talk she said \u201cI already said what I needed to say to my brother\u201d and won\u2019t talk this out with me. \nRewind a few month for back story: my SIL always tells us WHEN they\u2019re visiting and for how long. Never asks or plans with us; just tells us. In December they visited for 10 days, shipped furniture, clothes, shoes, bedding, and returned it all to Costco when they were done with it. It made me sick!! \nSo, even though it was not my intent, I\u2019m soooooooo relieved that they didn\u2019t come, and honestly, my life is alot less stressful without them taking over our home (that they treat as their personal vacation house) every 2 months for 8-10 days at a time!

Sounds like her choosing not to speak to you is a blessing, enjoy the peace.", "NTA and double fuck her for the returning stuff they used business. People like that are the reason you have to use 60 shitty napkins at a pizzeria because if they put out nice napkins they\u2019d still take 60 nice napkins. Keep returning shit (that ultimately will get destroyed in most cases, look it up) and they\u2019ll stop their awesome return policy like Amazon.", "NTA. You choose who gets to stay in your home. Full stop.\nNo one gets an automatic pass just because they are family. \nSIL can stay with her mom.", "NTA. Your SIL sounds obnoxious.", "So your SIL \u201cbuys\u201d stuff from Costco, ships it to YOUR HOUSE to use for 2 months and then returns it for a refund?!!!   WTF kind of monsters are these people?  I wouldn\u2019t let her stay with me for that reason alone.", "WTF NTA Sage wisdom for today: No is a complete sentence. Stop letting her run roughshod over you, and there's nothing you needed to talk over anyway. No is an ample response.\n\nNo way in hell is anybody staying in my home without me there or telling when they'll be visiting.. Seriously entitled BS. Pissing her off sounds like a win-win, so keep doing it. But you need your husband on board for this so he doesn't cave.", "NTA. Your dojo. Your rules. Their pushiness.", "NTA.  That is weird to 1) Invite yourself to someone else's home and 2) make plans to stay when you know they won't be home.  Absolutely not!  Talk to your husband about setting some boundaries with his family.", "NTA. You without a doubt have the right to exclude obnoxious people like your in-laws from your home.", ">Am I the asshole for FINALLY putting my foot down\n\nThat was a very soft footfall.\n\nNTA.", "NTA and YWNBTA if you didn't want them there even when you ARE home. That Costco shit is trashy and obnoxious. She sucks so bad lol.", "NTA and why limit it to just when you're not there?  It's your home, not a free hotel.", "NTA\n\n\nWhat's she going to do?? Not talk to you and not take over your home anymore?? BYE!! .... Although I'm pretty sure she will come to her illogical senses and realize she's been doing you a favor.... And the forced vacations will be attempted to be resumed again....and it will be on you once again to enforce the NO boundary.
