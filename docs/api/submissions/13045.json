This time for her 40th, my daughters 5th and my MIL 65th bdays all within 10 days of eachother.  My daughter wanted 1 thing for her bday- to go to great wolf lodge. So as a family we all agreed to go for her. I found a 40% code and booked 2 nights out of the 8 that they would be in town.  \nAfter a few weeks my MIL tells my husband that they all will just come to Great Wolf for a day but that my SIL and husband didn\u2019t want to stay at a kids resort. Later, we called my SIL to discuss the plans and I asked if they planned on staying with their parents since we\u2019d be out of town. She replied with \u201cno, we are staying at THE house.\u201d (You mean, mine and my husbands house?). I told her I was uncomfortable with the thought of anyone staying in our home when we aren\u2019t there. \nA few days later, she calls my husband and goes off. Saying I don\u2019t trust them, I always pull this shit, why can\u2019t I ever be happy. And they canceled their trip. When I txt her to try to talk she said \u201cI already said what I needed to say to my brother\u201d and won\u2019t talk this out with me. \nRewind a few month for back story: my SIL always tells us WHEN they\u2019re visiting and for how long. Never asks or plans with us; just tells us. In December they visited for 10 days, shipped furniture, clothes, shoes, bedding, and returned it all to Costco when they were done with it. It made me sick!! \nSo, even though it was not my intent, I\u2019m soooooooo relieved that they didn\u2019t come, and honestly, my life is alot less stressful without them taking over our home (that they treat as their personal vacation house) every 2 months for 8-10 days at a time!

Sounds like her choosing not to speak to you is a blessing, enjoy the peace.", "NTA and double fuck her for the returning stuff they used business. People like that are the reason you have to use 60 shitty napkins at a pizzeria because if they put out nice napkins they\u2019d still take 60 nice napkins. Keep returning shit (that ultimately will get destroyed in most cases, look it up) and they\u2019ll stop their awesome return policy like Amazon.", "NTA. You choose who gets to stay in your home. Full stop.\nNo one gets an automatic pass just because they are family. \nSIL can stay with her mom.", "NTA.

I wouldn\u2019t let her stay with me for that reason alone.", "WTF NTA Sage wisdom for today: No is a complete sentence. Stop letting her run roughshod over you, and there's nothing you needed to talk over anyway. No is an ample response.\n\nNo way in hell is anybody staying in my home without me there or telling when they'll be visiting.. Seriously entitled BS.

That is weird to 1) Invite yourself to someone else's home and 2) make plans to stay when you know they won't be home.  Absolutely not!

Not talk to you and not take over your home anymore?? BYE!! .... Although I'm pretty sure she will come to her illogical senses and realize she's been doing you a favor.... And the forced vacations will be attempted to be resumed again....and it will be on you once again to enforce the NO boundary.

The tip off here is her saying \"my brother\" in that snotty way. It sounds like she doesn't even like you. Run with her cancellation and don't let her backtrack! She doesn't deserve to stay in your home.", "NTA", "NTA no one is obligated to your home as a hotel, and it's extremely rude to demand it.", "VERY! This isn\u2019t the first time she\u2019s thrown a temper tantrum when I\u2019ve expressed my feelings", "Congrats, you will probably never have to host her again!", "So NTA. If your going to be out of town they have no reason to stay at your house. They are just using you so they don't have to get a hotel room. If I was in your shoes I wouldn't let then either.", "NTA. Make sure she doesn't come to stay in two months. Talk with your husband about this issue as well and be on the same page. Your sil sounds entitled and ridiculous.", "NTA I would react the same way and say they couldn\u2018 t stay over when I\u2018m not there. \nIt\u2018s your \u201esafe\u201c place and no one has the rights to claim to be their.\nThey should have been thankful for all the times they\u2018 ve stayed over but not assume it would be like this everey time they come and visit. Your home is not a hotel.", "NTA, your sister, on the other hand, hoo-boy. And I'm laughing my ass off at her characterization of Great Wolf Lodge as a \"kid's resort.\" We had our annual holiday party at the one in the Dells one year. It is most definitely NOT a kid's resort. Yes, there's a water park, but there's plenty of other things to do. There's a couple of restaurants in there I can't see anyone in their right mind going to with kids. Suites with hot tubs. Yeah, that's just for kids /s", "Nta. She should have been staying at her parents house", "NTA\n\nBut OP, when people makes unreasonable demand, you don't answer with \"I'm uncomfortable with that\". You say \"no, where did you get that crazy idea from\".\n\nDon't be surprised if people in your life are entitled if you answer like that to their entitlement.\n\nOf course she tries to take advantage of you, your only answer is \"I'm uncomfortable\"", "Nta", "NTA.\n\nI think the outcome is very positive for you. I find it funny that she thinks that she's punishing you for not coming to your house or talking to you.", "Yeah, a lot of returns have to be tossed where I work.

They were already staying way too often", "NTA - and for her to suggest it is weird.  She invites herself to stay and announces she will have deliveries made? She needs a hotel with a good concierge ! \n\nWhen you say 'we agreed as a family' - you , your husband and your children - not the extended IL's family?", "NTA OP is a smart woman! Your sister in law sounds like a nightmare to me.", "Well done you for standing your ground. Going forward I would let her know that she will no longer be staying at your house. NTA", "NTA. Your SIL is horrible and entitled!", "NTA and if she ever pulls this shit again \"I wish you would have checked with us, we'll be busy but I'm sure you'll have fun at the Holiday Inn\".", "You are NTA, that title belongs to your self entitled SIL. Why does she think she's entitled to stay in your house when she feels like it, why does she refer to your home as \"the house\"? It's your home and she's not entitled to even visit you, nevermind stay in it without asking your permission if she can stay with you. \nNow you annoyed self entitled AH SIL it sounds like your life just got a lot easier .", "And stop completely allowing her to stay at your house.

So NTA\n\nNext time she calls \"We're coming over for 10 days!\" do it like her and just say \"No you're not. Bye!\"", "What does your husband think about her behavior?", "The triangulation through your husband seems interesting. First, she *erases* you from your home (THE house), then firehoses you with accusations, and at last, refuses to talk about the issues with you. \n\nAnyways, if I was you, I'd see their actions in a similar light to a dementia patient - neither can control the chaotic shenanigans they're up to, but both can be managed to a certain extent (limiting contact, having boundaries, antipsychotics, etc).\n\nWhat is your husband's take on the situation? Is it a normal for him?", "Talk to your husband is and tell him next time she calls she's coming he needs to wish her luck with Airbnb or ask her where she's booking/staying. \n\nNever again allow her to stay at your house.\n\nNTA", "NTA. Good riddance to bad guests.", "NTA.  Go a big step further and tell them your home is no longer available to them while they are in town, whether or not you\u2019re there.  Point them toward local hotels or vacation rentals.  Your home is not a bed and breakfast and no one will be staying with you unless they\u2019ve been invited to do so.  There will be a lot of screaming, but in the end, you will be really glad you did this.\n\n(I\u2019m appalled at the audacity of anyone to tell someone they are coming to stay with them for 8-10 days every other month.

I work for the company that owns the Great Wolf Lodge, glad you got the discount, your SIL sounds exhausting.", "Wait, what happened to Amazon\u2019s return policy?", "They returned a whole queen size mattress to Costco, knowing it can\u2019t be resold. Yet, we have 2 fully furnished guest rooms! Like wtf", "She can easily stay at her parents house or get a hotel. I hope your husband is backing you up. Nta", "So my husband and a peaceful guy. Will avoid conflict at all costs. Especially with her because he\u2019s even called her a \u201cmental bulldog\u201d  so I have to be the one to talk to her because he can\u2019t. He will never deal with her temper tantrums, especially because she runs to their parents and continues her tantrums to suit her narrative", "There\u2019s been some petty games since all this and I told him the longer she pulls this bs and purposely avoids me, the longer I\u2019m sticking to she\u2019s not allowed even in our house", "Oh shit that\u2019s a good idea. And no\u2026 they used everything for 9 DAYS and then returned it!! A mattress included, while we have 2 finished guest rooms!"]}
