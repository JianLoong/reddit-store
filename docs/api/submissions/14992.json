She has anxiety regarding hospitals and is anxious about the thought of my not being there with her.\n\nTrouble is, just over an hour ago, Nadine called from the emergency room. Cassie is undergoing an emergency appendectomy (still in the operating room as I type) and is expected to be in the hospital for at least a few days. Nadine has her mother with her for support, and when I spoke with Nadine's mother, she asked me when I was flying in.\n\nDelicately, I explained that I couldn't leave my wife when our baby is to arrive at any moment. When my ex-MIL began all but shrieking and calling me the heartless Mexican devil (charming I know) she then threatened to cut me off from updates about Cassie.\n\nLuckily Nadine wrestled her phone out of ex-MIL's hand and promised to call me back. But before we could speak again, my ex-MIL and one of my ex-SIL's began bombarding me with messages and voice mails calling me a horrible father for choosing an unborn baby over my daughter during an emergency.\n\nNadine is even more stressed trying to damage control and while I know that she understands that I can't come right now (she outright told that there's no way she would even let me think of leave my wife right now) I feel guilty her support is gone because of her mother and crazy sister.\n\nI just know that I will wake up with a full inbox because of my ex-inlaws.\n\nAlina is still asleep and I don't want to wake her and stress her more right now.\n\nI haven't posted here before so I thought I would give it a shot.

You want to be there, Nadine knows you wish you could be there, and your daughter will know that you are thinking of her, because you are going to send a huge flower bouquet to her room with a note.\n\nIn the meantime, you have to be there when your child is born - you only get one shot at that, and if you aren\u2019t there it will be long remembered. \n\nLet Alina sleep, call your daughter tomorrow and send the flowers. Rest easy, papa.", "NTA Unless you have reason to believe that Cassie might die, you can\u2019t leave your wife right now.", "NTA. Her mom and grandmother are both there already (many hospitals are still limiting numbers of visitors), and you can't risk flying out of state when you could miss your child's birth. \n\nJust make sure to check in on Cassie whenever possible. Nadine sounds like a good mom if she's got your back against the evil MIL.", "Thanks to the commenters (the polite people) for your input. Am waiting to hear from Nadine before trying to sleep again but I think I will be up most of the night.\n\nCassie will hopefully understand and I will do whatever I can to support her from afar during her recovery. I will call her every hour if she wants me to.", "NTA.\n\nAs someone who has given birth and has had an appendectomy as an adult... Be there for your wife. \n\nI was a huge bundle of nerves the last few weeks when I was about to give birth and when I was finally brought to the hospital.\n\nWhile I was joking with nurses that I thought they'd give me a ballgown when they said that they'd help assist me in changing into my hospital gown for my appendectomy.  This was 30 minutes or less before my surgery... I was in pain then, but knowing it was just my appendix kinda removed my worries.\n\nSo be there for your wife and keep close contact with your daughter. If you have the good relationship which I feel you do, she'd understand.", "NTA\n\n\nGenerally speaking appendectomies are ultra safe, unless you have any reasons to believe Cassie may be in actual danger then there was no need for you to leave your wife. Births are really important and Alina has made it known she wants you there.\n\n\nYour ex in-laws have no right to behave the way they did and their opinion doesn't really matter. What matters is you being there for your pregnant about to pop wife. Granted, if she wasn't this close to giving birth or if Cassie was about to die then yeah, flying to her would be the right thing. But that isn't the case so..\n\n\n>she outright told that there's no way she would even let me think of leave my wife right now\n\n\nShe seems sweet and it sounds like you are both mature enough to realize this. Don't let your ex in-laws influence you, I don't even know how they expected you to fly out of the state in such short notice.\n\n\nAlso, communicate with Alina and tell her what's going on. I'd also recommend talking with Cassie and seeing how she feels, since she is the one mainly affected by this absence, not Nadine's mother.", "NTA\n\nYou did the right thing. Unfortunately you can't be two places at once, and top priority is being with your wife when she goes into labour. Had Cassie been in life-threatening danger you would have had a real conundrum on your hands, but fortunately an appendectomy is about as routine as surgery gets. There was no real need for you to fly out given she has her mother there and will probably be discharged in a couple of days. You were right to prioritise your wife and baby in this instance, and your racist MIL can sit and spin.", "NTA. You are in a real tough spot, as whatever you do someone is going to be upset. Your daughter isn't alone, and your ex thinks you should stay with your wife. All signs your doing the right thing. Lucky your daughters condition is quite common these day, so the drs will be well practiced and she should be OK.\n\nI'm sorry your in such a tricky situation, and hope your daughter recovers well", "NTA\n\nIt sounds like Nadine doesn\u2019t think you\u2019re TA either, which is good in terms of the perspectives that will be influencing your daughter. Always great when both parents are on the same page. An appendectomy is pretty routine. Call your daughter when she\u2019s awake and keep in touch with her and Nadine. I hope your daughter recovers quickly!", "NTA\n\nYou can always see Cassie when she wakes up from surgery. Your ex MIL and SIL are AHs for choosing a time when Cassie had surgery to argue with you.", "NTA. That ex MIL sounds like a nightmare. \n\nYou can call your daughter and see how she's doing after she's out of surgery and rested. How far away are they from you? Since you said flying in, I'm going to assume you're at least a few hundred miles away?\n\nSounds like your ex wife needs to calm her mom the hell down and you can talk to your daughter on your own. Am Appendectomy is super routine and sounds like your ex wife is understanding.", "NTA, you have to be there for your wife. Unless you have a reason to think that your daughter might not make it, you should not be there. Tell your wife about this though.", "NTA. This is a real life trolley problem, my friend. Normally, yup, you\u2019d be a bad parent for not being beside your child during a hospital emergency. \n\nBut you have a baby due any minute, a wife with a high risk pregnancy, and an impossible choice. \n\nKeep a close eye on your daughter\u2019s condition - appendicitis can be tricky, but if she clears surgery fine, you\u2019ll have more information and can change your decision if needed. Even if you hopped on a plane this second, you\u2019re unlikely to be there for her current surgery (and worse, you might be in the air when an update comes through) so wait it out and try to tune out the flying monkeys.", "NTA. \n\nWife possibly going into labor any time trumps an emergency surgery that is already underway and with people present to support her. \n\nYour presence post OP, while probably appreciated by your daughter, wouldn't bring that much to the situation that isn't already there.\n\nHaving her husband there with her through what will presumably be one of the roughest times of her life will make a lot of difference to your wife.", "NTA. Your is a crappy situation, but your daughter would be out of surgery before you flew in. You can FaceTime with her when she wakes up.", "NTA depending on what state and flights you wouldn't be there until long after she is awake anyways. Best thing would be to wait until morning, discuss everything with your wife and your ex to see if your presence is even needed (it likely won't be as she should be fine). You can video chat with her once she is awake if she's feeling up to it.", "NTA - you can't be two places at once. Unless there are complications, your being there wouldn't do much good since she already has family there. They are scared and overreacting and also probably a bit peeved that you have a new baby on the way. \n\nTalk to your wife when she wakes up - don't keep this to yourself.", "NTA. That\u2019s such a tough spot to be in. Being as they aren\u2019t a short drive away you definitely shouldn\u2019t leave your wife. Can you block the ex in laws temporarily on phone?", "NTA, and your ex wife thankfully sees that too. Your ex-ILs are acting irrationally and making things worse in two different stressful medical situations.", "NTA. Not like you'd be there in time for the surgery anyway. And unless she has signifant complications (which doesn't sound like) most people go home the next day. Her mom is with her. Her mom chose to take her out of state away from you. Unless she has severe complications and is deathly ill she'll jsut have to understand. You can't be un two places at the same time and a delivery is going to be much higher risk than an appendectomy. Hopefully your adult daughter will understand. If not her mom brainwashed her....", "Damned if you do and damned if you don't.\n\nTwo people yu love and care about are in fragile circumstances.  Your daughter with the emergency surgery and your wife  who could give birth at any time.\n\nBoth your daughter and your wife have people to support them.\n\nDaughter is far enough away that the time involved in traveling is significant, and factor in the need to return for your wife and the birth.\n\nNTA", "No, no, no, NTA. It's not even a question. You should trust that your ex-wife told you your daughter's prognosis accurately and act based on that.", "You are between a rock and a hard place.  By the time you catch a flight and your 19yo will be out of surgery no doubt.  If she\u2019s in surgery, you most likely wouldn\u2019t get there before she woke.  \n\nAs soon as possible I would FaceTime your daughter. \n\nI suggest you stay with your wife until the baby is born, but let her know that you may need to go see your 19yo within a few weeks of the birth for a few days.   Hopefully wife\u2019s mom will still be around. \n\nNAH.", "Nah i think you shouldve been there for your child imo", "NTA - nor is your wife, your ex wife or your daughter. In-laws yes but who cares.", "NTA- Your daughter has her mom and grandma there for her. I could understand going to see her if she was in a local hospital. But since it seems you would need to fly its reasonable to not travel. You already commented that you plan on sending flowers and a cookie boquet wich will show your daughter you care and are definitely thinking of her.", "Are you even involved in your daughters life since it said you had to fly in? Me personally I would pick my daughter and would think my spouse would understand but to each there own. I mean your excuse was her mother is there, well your wife\u2019s mother is there too what\u2019s the difference. You chose you was more important to you so why are you bothered?", "Depends on how far you would have to travel to get to your daughter.  If everyone is local, you could be with your daughter and MIL could get your wife to the hospital and you could meet tjere.5", "Dude, you are in a no win situation. You are going to be the asshole to whomever you choose to not be with.   Hopefully your daughter will understand. \n\nI'd send the flowers, cookie bouquet, as well as a personalized gift box full of stuff you know she likes. And I'd get started on it NOW so you can send it out first thing tomorrow.  The special treat she liked as a kid, get it. Try to be as personal as you can.  \n\nPlease let us know what happens.
