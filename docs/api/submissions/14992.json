This was 30 minutes or less before my surgery... I was in pain then, but knowing it was just my appendix kinda removed my worries.\n\nSo be there for your wife and keep close contact with your daughter. If you have the good relationship which I feel you do, she'd understand.", "NTA\n\n\nGenerally speaking appendectomies are ultra safe, unless you have any reasons to believe Cassie may be in actual danger then there was no need for you to leave your wife. Births are really important and Alina has made it known she wants you there.\n\n\nYour ex in-laws have no right to behave the way they did and their opinion doesn't really matter.

Unfortunately you can't be two places at once, and top priority is being with your wife when she goes into labour. Had Cassie been in life-threatening danger you would have had a real conundrum on your hands, but fortunately an appendectomy is about as routine as surgery gets. There was no real need for you to fly out given she has her mother there and will probably be discharged in a couple of days. You were right to prioritise your wife and baby in this instance, and your racist MIL can sit and spin.", "NTA. You are in a real tough spot, as whatever you do someone is going to be upset.

Since you said flying in, I'm going to assume you're at least a few hundred miles away?\n\nSounds like your ex wife needs to calm her mom the hell down and you can talk to your daughter on your own.

Unless you have a reason to think that your daughter might not make it, you should not be there. Tell your wife about this though.", "NTA. This is a real life trolley problem, my friend. Normally, yup, you\u2019d be a bad parent for not being beside your child during a hospital emergency. \n\nBut you have a baby due any minute, a wife with a high risk pregnancy, and an impossible choice. \n\nKeep a close eye on your daughter\u2019s condition - appendicitis can be tricky, but if she clears surgery fine, you\u2019ll have more information and can change your decision if needed. Even if you hopped on a plane this second, you\u2019re unlikely to be there for her current surgery (and worse, you might be in the air when an update comes through) so wait it out and try to tune out the flying monkeys.", "NTA. \n\nWife possibly going into labor any time trumps an emergency surgery that is already underway and with people present to support her. \n\nYour presence post OP, while probably appreciated by your daughter, wouldn't bring that much to the situation that isn't already there.\n\nHaving her husband there with her through what will presumably be one of the roughest times of her life will make a lot of difference to your wife.", "NTA. Your is a crappy situation, but your daughter would be out of surgery before you flew in. You can FaceTime with her when she wakes up.", "NTA depending on what state and flights you wouldn't be there until long after she is awake anyways. Best thing would be to wait until morning, discuss everything with your wife and your ex to see if your presence is even needed (it likely won't be as she should be fine). You can video chat with her once she is awake if she's feeling up to it.", "NTA - you can't be two places at once. Unless there are complications, your being there wouldn't do much good since she already has family there. They are scared and overreacting and also probably a bit peeved that you have a new baby on the way. \n\nTalk to your wife when she wakes up - don't keep this to yourself.", "NTA. That\u2019s such a tough spot to be in. Being as they aren\u2019t a short drive away you definitely shouldn\u2019t leave your wife. Can you block the ex in laws temporarily on phone?", "NTA, and your ex wife thankfully sees that too. Your ex-ILs are acting irrationally and making things worse in two different stressful medical situations.", "NTA. Not like you'd be there in time for the surgery anyway. And unless she has signifant complications (which doesn't sound like) most people go home the next day. Her mom is with her. Her mom chose to take her out of state away from you. Unless she has severe complications and is deathly ill she'll jsut have to understand. You can't be un two places at the same time and a delivery is going to be much higher risk than an appendectomy.

Some easy snacks, maybe include a package of hard candy to help keep her mouth moist. After surgery sometimes fluids don't help dry mouth, but the hard candy might. A good book or even an adult coloring book and new gel pens or color pencils. Include a sharpener if you send the pencils. Maybe an apple or Google gift card. Depending on which phone she has. She can download and listen to music or a book or get a game or movie with it. Include a nice mug, and flavored tea and honey ,or hot cocoa. Or a nice water bottle with some drink packets. \n\nI always like a nice throw blanket and fuzzy socks cause they are like a nice hug to me. \n\nCongrats on the new baby. Don't forget a new pj set, socks and throw blanket, mug with tea and honey for your wife. It really will help her too.", "my brother (who was a healthy child at the time) literally almost died from his appendectomy surgery. Yes, it may be routine, but crap can still happen.  He was in the ICU and then in the hospital for weeks.  Surgery is still surgery.", "I feel you. I've spent A LOT of time in the hospital while they tried to keep me alive, and even in ICU I feel like I have to be \"on\" and a good hostess \ud83d\ude02 plus I look like a swamp witch and just want to enjoy my drugs and food network.", "I have basically zero contact with my relatives but my family is my friends. When I had my appendix taken out last year, all I wanted was my best friend. Like in recovery I was asking for her. When back on the ward, I asked for her. I managed to unlock my phone high off the morphine and give them her number. Once she got there, I proceeded to tell her I loved her, hold her hand and then went back to sleep and wouldn\u2019t let go of her hand \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "Dude, you came out and insulted him and are clutching your pearls that he got pissed back. Don't dish out if you can't take it.", "And if you're smart and you read all the replies it is clearly stated that the ex-wife moved for her job. Rather judgmental of you", "She's 19 my dude. That's grown.", "Well, she's 19 so she is grown now.", "In my experience you still didn\u2019t really want to eat real food. Things are still extremely painful (it takes days to be able to stand fully upright again) and sore and once you wait enough that you feel like eating real food you\u2019re also probably waiting for your first bowel movement, which is uncomfortable (you\u2019ll feel constipated leading up to it). I would still check before sending cookies.\n\nYour whole stomach area is going to be super sensitive.", "That\u2019s wonderful. I wasn\u2019t allowed to eat anything for 2 days, and my stomach hurt so badly from being hungry. Even after I went home, I was allowed rice, yoghurt and bananas but nothing else for a few days. I was happy to skip school for a few weeks, though \ud83d\ude05", "Mine used to freak us out with let me harvest your tears. Instantly stopped any of us crying because we were all too what the fuck even dad to continue crying.", "You can even buy stuffies of the organ that was removed. I have one from when I had my VSG done, his name is Barry the Sleeve.\n\nhttps://a.co/d/6AHhgE9", "Your comment has been removed because it violates [Rule 1: Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

Meanwhile maternal mortality risk is 3 in 10000 approx in US.\n\nI know who's side I'd be at.", "I don\u2019t recall comparing it to the risk of walking down the street. I just don\u2019t think it\u2019s helpful to quote incorrect data. \n\nIt sounds like the comparative mortality risk is the sole factor you\u2019d consider in making this decision, which is okay.", "The original commenter to me on this thread did. You continued the argument on that point.\n\nOlder data is not incorrect simply because it's old. It could potentially be more accurate depending on other factors like study design."]}
