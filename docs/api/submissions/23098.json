But you're better off in the long run learning to not put yourself down when it's not necessary to do so. This isn't a serious job where you have to submit a resume and have a degree.

I asked if that's what she was referring to only to find out that my mom's sister didn't know she had bypass surgery. My mom had been telling her that she lost all the weight by following a certain diet and exercise program. Whoops!", "NTA you weren't even making your mom look bad. She gushed about you to her friend because she's proud of you and she should be. You just tried to be humble and tell them that while yes you did well it was not without alot of hard work and effort on your part. This is perfectly reasonable because it sets the tone that you are there to help her, not do the work for her.", "A lie is a lie, it's just the degree in which it is untrue.
