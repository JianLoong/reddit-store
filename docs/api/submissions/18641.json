Its not wrong for you to want the title you deserve as an active parent, your SD calls her dad, dad because he earned that title and you want the same respect and love because you are a good dad.

He had a nickname, and then his name. Neither of them sounded anything alike. Imagine \u201cMatthew\u201d and \u201cLuigi\u201d. I\u2019m not joking, those aren\u2019t far off but anyways. I always knew him by Luigi as a child. I\u2019d heard people call him Matthew from time to time but as a kid I said Luigi cause that\u2019s what my dad said. One night, his daughter who\u2019s a year or so younger than me, called him Luigi cause she heard me call him Luigi. He lost his shit on me and screamed at me to call him Matthew or call him nothing. This was a decent chunk of time ago, and I still remember it VIVIDLY.

Your wife has both children call her mama, so she doesn\u2019t understand. Most parents hate when their kids call them their name. For my mom it was always seen as disrespectful.

When my younger child asked to call me by name, I felt uncomfortable because tradition, but ultimately decided that it would show a double standard if I let one of my kids call me by name and not the others. I like it now, especially as I have transitioned away from Gender, but even before when I was still okay with Gendered terms, I sat with my discomfort and realized that whatever my child calls me, that doesn\u2019t change our relationship unless I let it. \n\nIt\u2019s just a name, and it\u2019s my name, and I thought it was somewhat disrespectful to tell my child that because of our relationship they are forbidden from using my actual name that everyone else uses. Nothing else changed about our relationship; they didn\u2019t respect me as a parent BECAUSE they have to call me their parent every time they talk to me; they didn\u2019t forget I\u2019m their parent because they don\u2019t verbally say it all the time; they respect me as a parent because I am their parent and I treat them with respect as my child. \n\nSo NAH because I get where you\u2019re coming from and why you feel how you feel, because it\u2019s tradition. But this is just a different perspective. We feel how we feel because of reasons, and we have the power to choose what to do with our feelings.
