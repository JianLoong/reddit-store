It could also become an authority and respect issue later, as teenagers sometimes try to call their parents by their first names as a way to assert that you're no different from any other adult and have no particular authority over them.

Its not wrong for you to want the title you deserve as an active parent, your SD calls her dad, dad because he earned that title and you want the same respect and love because you are a good dad. I truly hope your wife can understand that. your daughter is young and not doing it to hurt you she's just trying to be like her big sister and your wife is unbothered because it changes nothing for her she's still mom or mommy ( I assume) . My niece calls her dad matt (fake name) because all of us call him matt including his wife and he says nothing but i can tell it hurts and we all collectively started calling him dad or daddy when speaking to her about him to try and help ( it does seem to be working a bit).

Good luck", "OP let me tell you a story that has a similar note to this one. When I was younger (around 7-8) my dad had a friend that I would stay the night with from time to time. He had a nickname, and then his name. Neither of them sounded anything alike. Imagine \u201cMatthew\u201d and \u201cLuigi\u201d. I\u2019m not joking, those aren\u2019t far off but anyways. I always knew him by Luigi as a child. I\u2019d heard people call him Matthew from time to time but as a kid I said Luigi cause that\u2019s what my dad said. One night, his daughter who\u2019s a year or so younger than me, called him Luigi cause she heard me call him Luigi. He lost his shit on me and screamed at me to call him Matthew or call him nothing. This was a decent chunk of time ago, and I still remember it VIVIDLY. It terrified me and I was scared to approach him at all after that. \n\nI think gently correcting your daughter is absolutely the way to go. Because you have grown up feelings and you\u2019re trying to express those to a non-grown up without causing something like I went through. Your wife has both children call her mama, so she doesn\u2019t understand. Most parents hate when their kids call them their name. For my mom it was always seen as disrespectful. She wasn\u2019t rude about it, but you could tell it upset her. \n\nNTA.

When my younger child asked to call me by name, I felt uncomfortable because tradition, but ultimately decided that it would show a double standard if I let one of my kids call me by name and not the others. I like it now, especially as I have transitioned away from Gender, but even before when I was still okay with Gendered terms, I sat with my discomfort and realized that whatever my child calls me, that doesn\u2019t change our relationship unless I let it. \n\nIt\u2019s just a name, and it\u2019s my name, and I thought it was somewhat disrespectful to tell my child that because of our relationship they are forbidden from using my actual name that everyone else uses. Nothing else changed about our relationship; they didn\u2019t respect me as a parent BECAUSE they have to call me their parent every time they talk to me; they didn\u2019t forget I\u2019m their parent because they don\u2019t verbally say it all the time; they respect me as a parent because I am their parent and I treat them with respect as my child. \n\nSo NAH because I get where you\u2019re coming from and why you feel how you feel, because it\u2019s tradition. But this is just a different perspective. We feel how we feel because of reasons, and we have the power to choose what to do with our feelings.

Maybe ask step daughter to tell your daughter that she addresses her bio father as dad/daddy and that she doesn\u2019t address him by his name. And tell your daughter that she can address step daughter\u2019s dad by his name if the situation arises. Your wife is the a hole here, because she should be supporting your child calling you dad/daddy, and because of the \u201cbroken her spirit\u201d comment. Good grief.

Your wife is an AH to you though and I would recommend that you guys sort this out sooner than later. It doesn\u2019t matter that she wouldn\u2019t care if her kids called her by her first name.  It matters to you. And that is enough in its own right. If she loved and respected you, she would be working hard to help you (calling you Daddy in front of your daughter).

I am curious if she does this elsewhere in your relationship.", "The son of a friend of mine believed for a time that all adult men were named \u201cDad\u201d or \u201cDaddy\u201d. He called his own father \u201cPapa\u201d, so clearly his friends calling the men picking them up from day care \u201cDaddy\u201d must be using their names.

Her brain doesn't work that way.", "When he was around 3, our 5yo realized what our \"secret\" names were from what friends called us, and loves using it. Not all the time, but whenever he has an excuse to. He's also gotten a bit into the Simpson so I think Bart calling Homer by his name could influence it. \n\nBowling, we used our regular names so he loves saying our names to tell us it's our turn. Or if one of us is calling for the other parent and uses it, he will echo us. And rarely when he is just addressing us, he sometimes will drop it. Especially if one of us is distracted and he needs our attention. \n\nBut he also does still regularly call us Mom and Dad. \n\nHis name has some nickname options that he is personally starting to identity with. (Think Wilbert, being called Will)  not as a primary name, but the concept as still meaning him even if not his proper name. For a while originally he only insisted his proper name was his name. \n\nI think you're fine in how you are addressing the issue. My mom doesn't like him referring to her by her first name, so I correct him when he has and he sticks to her grandparent name. But we don't make a big deal about it. \n\nPeople should have the right to feel comfortable with how people address them. Your wife is being an AH. Is she insecure about her daughter not calling you dad and fearing you won't feel as close?", "YTA. When she will be a bit older, she'll understand things better and will make a conscious decision how to call you. Her 4-y.o. habits won't matter, as she'll probably won't even remember them.

It's extremely helpful if you're in public with other groups of kids and parents and they need to get your attention. \n\nAllow your daughter to get comfortable using both.

My stepdaughter would naturally refer to me as Mom when speaking about me to her siblings like \"go ask Mommy\" but when speaking to me it was my name. That helped matters.

It's not a power trip to want to be called by a preferred name and it doesn't affect your wife because all of the children call her mum, I wonder how she would feel if the eldest suddenly addressed her by her given name instead of mum?  You haven't broken anybodies spirit either,  your 4 year old is leaning that you have two names Justin and Dad,  she'll be fine.", "My aunt Cassandra become AC to everyone in the family because that's how us kids did it.

I know I did and so did many others. Correcting her can actually reinforce the behaviour out of rebellion (aka it let\u2019s the child know that you feel strongly about something which gives them a way to push back against you) or it can just generally make a big deal out of nothing and create a problem where there isn\u2019t one. Your wife has a more measured approach thinking you should just let it go for now and wait for it to pass, and she\u2019s not wrong or TA for thinking that. Watching a grown adult correct a toddler over something insignificant is irritating especially when watching as the parent who is likely the primary caregiver. \n\n\nThis is a minor issue and it\u2019s weird to me how many people are saying your wife is some monster or hugely dramatic. I doubt she believes your daughter has broken her spirit, she probably just feels that you wore her down for no reason.
