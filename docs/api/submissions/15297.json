These questions are traps that make any good-faith respondent look like an asshole. \n\nI understand you feel hurt because you feel your girlfriend doesn\u2019t appreciate you for who you are as a person, and I sympathize. But honestly, financial independence is a reasonable standard to have in a partner. It\u2019s not necessarily, as some commenters have suggested, that your girlfriend would leave you if you fell on hard financial times, or that she doesn\u2019t care about personality. She might stay with you because she already loves you and is committed to your relationship. But that\u2019s not the same thing as looking for a new partner, which was the question you put in front of her.

Do you think she is shallow in other ways?", "I think you need to get a bit more info on why she feels that way if it's really bothering you. I'm not prepared to say she's the asshole (yet), but I understand why you feel the way you do about it. NAH: You're not the asshole for *thinking* she's being shallow. You would be if you held it against her without trying to figure out more. She might be the asshole if she cares about your money for reasons that go beyond needing to support you.\n\nIf this is bothering you, just ask her why she feels that way and what specifically would be different.

When you don't even really know them yet, I'm not sure you want to do that or feel comfortable with it..\n\nIn an extreme example. \n\nThat said, if one person ends up in dire straits, and the relationship is established - of course you let go of any financial balance and no, you don't care bc you're attached to them in full. But that's not realistic if you didn't start on somewhat even footing. And, it's also assuming that one person didn't just lose all ambition and decide to not work.\n\nAnyhow every situation is different but my point is that financial stability is desirable but not a dealbreaker.... But it is intertwined with trust and that's something that takes time to build.", "So.... I was homeless with my now-husband, and we literally built our life together from the ground up. Knowing what I know now, and going through what I went through, if my marriage were to fall apart and I had to date again, I would not date someone that isn't financially stable. Sorry if that hurts, but I do not want to go througb the trauma of food and housing insecurity again. I don't want to cry every time I get a bill. And now I have children to think about as well. \n\nDoes that make me a bad person? Maybe. But I believe there is so much more in a relationship than love. There's trust, stability, security, and, if course, love. I'm not saying that I would leave my husband if he suddenly lost his job, of course I wouldn't.

Do you think that's a reasonable expectation of someone you just met? Because that's who she would be in that scenario. \n\nIt's completely possible that if you were both the same people and got to know each other organically while you were poor she would develop feelings for you.

Frankly, I wouldn\u2019t want to be with someone flat broke either and I don\u2019t think that\u2019s shallow so much as it is pragmatic, particularly if you come from a background where you\u2019re used to certain things. To be clear, I have tremendous respect for you and others who are dealt a bad starting hand but pull themselves up through hard work and determination; however, no one wants to live below the poverty line. No one wants to go without consisting running water. Do some people have to? Yes, and that\u2019s objectively terrible but I would never choose to live like that it I didn\u2019t have to. Put simply, life is hard enough, so why would I intentionally opt to make it harder? That said, if I was already with someone and we fell on hard times, I\u2019d stay with them because a level of commitment had already been established. I think your girlfriend could\u2019ve shared her viewpoint more tactfully but there\u2019s nothing inherently \u201cwrong\u201d about how she feels.

He proposed to me because after we moved in together we fell on rough times and instead of running (which he thought I ought to) we junked parts, scraped metal, and I learned how to make the most out of everything that came across our kitchen and how to make it relatively tasty.
