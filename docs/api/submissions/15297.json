These questions are traps that make any good-faith respondent look like an asshole. \n\nI understand you feel hurt because you feel your girlfriend doesn\u2019t appreciate you for who you are as a person, and I sympathize. But honestly, financial independence is a reasonable standard to have in a partner. It\u2019s not necessarily, as some commenters have suggested, that your girlfriend would leave you if you fell on hard financial times, or that she doesn\u2019t care about personality. She might stay with you because she already loves you and is committed to your relationship. But that\u2019s not the same thing as looking for a new partner, which was the question you put in front of her.

Do you think she is shallow in other ways?", "I think you need to get a bit more info on why she feels that way if it's really bothering you. I'm not prepared to say she's the asshole (yet), but I understand why you feel the way you do about it. NAH: You're not the asshole for *thinking* she's being shallow. You would be if you held it against her without trying to figure out more. She might be the asshole if she cares about your money for reasons that go beyond needing to support you.\n\nIf this is bothering you, just ask her why she feels that way and what specifically would be different.

When you don't even really know them yet, I'm not sure you want to do that or feel comfortable with it..\n\nIn an extreme example. \n\nThat said, if one person ends up in dire straits, and the relationship is established - of course you let go of any financial balance and no, you don't care bc you're attached to them in full. But that's not realistic if you didn't start on somewhat even footing. And, it's also assuming that one person didn't just lose all ambition and decide to not work.\n\nAnyhow every situation is different but my point is that financial stability is desirable but not a dealbreaker....

Knowing what I know now, and going through what I went through, if my marriage were to fall apart and I had to date again, I would not date someone that isn't financially stable. Sorry if that hurts, but I do not want to go througb the trauma of food and housing insecurity again. I don't want to cry every time I get a bill. And now I have children to think about as well. \n\nDoes that make me a bad person? Maybe. But I believe there is so much more in a relationship than love. There's trust, stability, security, and, if course, love. I'm not saying that I would leave my husband if he suddenly lost his job, of course I wouldn't.

Frankly, I wouldn\u2019t want to be with someone flat broke either and I don\u2019t think that\u2019s shallow so much as it is pragmatic, particularly if you come from a background where you\u2019re used to certain things. To be clear, I have tremendous respect for you and others who are dealt a bad starting hand but pull themselves up through hard work and determination; however, no one wants to live below the poverty line. No one wants to go without consisting running water. Do some people have to? Yes, and that\u2019s objectively terrible but I would never choose to live like that it I didn\u2019t have to. Put simply, life is hard enough, so why would I intentionally opt to make it harder? That said, if I was already with someone and we fell on hard times, I\u2019d stay with them because a level of commitment had already been established.

What's she gonna do if you fall on hard times?\n\nDo yourself a favor and find someone who loves you for you, richer or poorer.\n\nConsider yourself lucky she took of the mask before you got married.", "NTA, and to quote Dhar Mann, \u201cif someone is not there at your worst, than they don\u2019t need to be there at your best.\u201d And honestly not dating someone just because they were poor back then but now they are stapled in the future honestly sounds like the behavior of a Golddigger.", "But ... they're not married. I feel like people who ask this question to girlfriends and boyfriends get what they deserve. They expect their partners to love them for better or worse, but if they were bringing the same level of commitment, then they would have popped the question by now.", "Exactly, shallow doesn\u2019t even begin to describe it.  The first sign of things not going OP\u2019s way and his girlfriend is going to dump his ass, and I\u2019ll give the girlfriend credit for being honest and telling OP exactly what he can expect from her if he falls on hard times.  OP, why wait?", "Exactly. She showed her true colors. She only thinks he's worth it if he always has money and bad shit never happens.", "> Does that make me a bad person?\n\nNo. Not even a little bit.", "I feel like not dating someone because of their wealth in HS is a lot more shallow than adulthood. In HS there's buses and you see each other everyday. Out of school you'll need a car for most places and need to pay for more things unless you live somewhere scenic with quality budget dating activities.", "If my bf suddenly became broke, I would for sure stick by him because i know him well enough to know he is driven and wouldn\u2019t let me enable him. However if I were single and just met someone who\u2019s broke, I wouldn\u2019t give that a chance. I have no idea how motivated they are, how good they are with finances, how much I\u2019d have to support them, what their debt and credit is like, etc. \n\nTo anyone that thinks that\u2019s shallow, nearly 25% of all couples break up over finances. It\u2019s naiive to think \u201clove\u201d will conquer all. Being financially literate is really important to me as someone who dealt with parents who made horrible business decisions that burdened me and my siblings. I very much value my security in having a home, benefits, and savings.", "Exactly. It's a nice fantasy - \"together forever, always\" - but the reality is that being in a relationship with someone who's in a very different financial position to you is very tough and usually doesn't work. The financially-stronger partner is forced into either financially supporting the weaker one or downgrading their lifestyle to match, which inevitably puts a strain on the relationship. \n\nIf you were fairly equally in the beginning, then one of you suffers a tragedy, then it's a bit different. The strain is still there, but you have an existing bond to counter it. If the strain is there from the beginning, it's hard to build much of a connection before money troubles crush it.", "So you\u2019re putting the whole blame on your supposed partner and only go safe yourself? What happened to \u201cthrough good and bad, in health and sickness\u201d type of relationships?", "Disagree. I grew up poor from a refugee family, and my wife and I braved the elements together, especially when i lost my job due to COVID. Now we're living comfortably. Can't get there without some rough patches, and if you're still fickle just looking for the next best thing, you'll never get there.", "Good for you for yelling from the rooftops that you'll run for the hills the moment things get rough instead of putting any work into the relationship by, God forbid, SUPPORTING THEM UNTIL THEY GET BACK ON THEIR FEET. Shit happens. You can either be a good partner and stick it out because it's temporary hardship or a bad one and decide to abandon them for someone else who has money.", "Naw. He learned something important from this. Hard times come and go, and no matter who he is, or what he's done to lift himself out of that situation? It could happen again. Now he's learned that if he falls on hard times? He's on his own. His partner does not have his back. At all. This is absolutely a question he DOES want the answer to, and now he's got it. He needs to know the answer to this question because now he knows how far his partner's love and support extend - the same length as his bank account.", "Agree. And now she won\u2019t be comfortable to be honest when asked other questions!", "Also she was responding about what she would have done back then. Perhaps she has grown up and evolved", "But this isn\u2019t about the childhood as much as it is about her stating that she wouldn\u2019t be with him if he was poor? That shit can happen in an instance, and she\u2019s telling him she\u2019s gonna leave.", "I am on disability. I can't sit or stand for any period of time. So, I am in bed. She takes care of me like I am a god damned child. I feel so guilty for it. If anybody is  an angel on earth, it is my wife..", "That's a touching story u/Fart-Fart-Fart-Fart", "Yeah, I\u2019m very curious the gf\u2019s thinking on this. Is she saying she wouldn\u2019t have dated him back then, but if something happened now she\u2019d stick it out? I think (within reason) everyone is allowed a deal breaker when not in a relationship to start with. I think OP needs to ask that question. Either way, they can be upset. It\u2019s sucky. NTA", "Absolutely. If my long term partner lost his job, was incapacitated, whatever - we\u2019re a team and we\u2019ll work it out. \n\nHowever, no fucking way would I *start a new relationship* with someone living in poverty. Who on earth would you want to significantly reduce your own circumstances for essentially a stranger?! You don\u2019t know them properly. You don\u2019t love them yet! You haven\u2019t been through life events together!", "But she also said \u201cshe wouldn\u2019t be with me if I was broke\u201d, which sounds to me like she\u2019d break up if OP fell on hard times", "Fortunately Kafka already answered that and it's no", ">She\u2019s openly told me that she doesn\u2019t want to compromise on anything that we disagree on\n\nTHIS is the problem right here, friend.  It's not the stupid hypothetical.  It's the real life answer to the real life issue of compromise.  Any relationship that doesn't involve compromise is not a partnership -- it's a dictatorship. \n\nThis is not the woman for you if/when you seek a real relationship.  She's  someone to be casual with, not serious.", "Seriously? There is a HUGE difference between meeting someone in poverty vs falling into it while in a committed relationship.", "Those things are important for that initial connection, but they don't house and feed your children.", "Honestly this may sound fucked up bur I agree I'd your that poor you shouldn't date. Because that's goingnto lead to children most likely. Then your subjecting children to poverty that have no choice. I get being lonely and wanting a companion. But until you are financially capable of taking care of yourself, dating is selfish because you are then putting the burden on someone else, and that not fair to them at all. It's different if you were established and had a relationship and then something happened to cause financial hardship. But starting a relationship when your are in that financial situation is absolutely selfish. More marriages and relationships end over financial difficulties than probably any other reason. It's just the truth. If you really want to have a partner you need a good foundation for yourself before you can involve someone else in your life.", "I understand why you feel that way.  What I\u2019ve found about being a good care partner is this - sometimes you just have to push that out of the way and accept the love.  I wish you both lots of that", "No.  She didn\u2019t say that at all.  In fact, she didn\u2019t mention the word \u201cdump\u201d according to OP\u2019s recitation of the facts.\n\nThese types of conversations are stupid.  I\u2019ve been married for years.  I doubt my wife would have gone out with me if I were homeless and living on the streets when we met.  Few women would.  OP\u2019s gf is merely being honest.", "My wife gave me an out when she got sidelined by constant migraines.  every single day.  Was forced into retirement at 27, fucked over by her disability insurance.  I told her that if she promised never to give up on herself, I wouldn't either.  We had only been together a year.  We have been together for 17 years.  It's been rough at times.  But it makes you tougher.", "Unless it\u2019s Ogtha", "Very true, but before they even got to that point she is already stating that RIGHT NOW she wouldn\u2019t be with him if he was poor. They\u2019re already dating, and still she said if he was poor now she would be gone. \n\nThat\u2019s very different from meeting someone poor, and if you\u2019re willing to leave a relationship over financial hardship that in my eyes makes her a selfish and unsuitable for a partnership with lifelong commitment.", "And probably would cause a pretty unequal relationship, which is something a lot of people wouldn't want. And you know what? It's not unreasonable, being always expected to be the one who pays can get tiring", "But that is.not the situation they were talking about - they were talking about poverty developing during a relationship. The person featured said I would never LEAVE you, even if we were under a bridge. OP's partner said they disagreed. You are quite literally validating a position which was not the one discussed between OP and his partner.", "I think she definitely indicated that. \u201cShe wouldn\u2019t be with me if I was broke\u201d clearly suggests that if OP lost his wealth she wouldn\u2019t be with him.\n\nNow I am not expecting rich people to date people who are extremely poor but at the same time there\u2019s a reason I wouldn\u2019t have married someone very rich when I was younger and it\u2019s partly because of the disparity in how rich and poor view money and love.", "Idk, maybe if we get a saw and try reaaaal hard?", "OP commented somewhere around here that he meant the past, not now", "Anything can be hygienic with enough hand sanitizer; instead of normal bathing, I just fill a tub with hand sanitizer and sit in it."]}
