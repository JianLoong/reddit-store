This happened 2 weeks ago and I tried to text her multiple times but she refuses to talk to me.

I think your friend might have something going on if she can't handle you liking a show that SHE told you about. \n\nAnd as to what she said about \"liking the show more than her\" idk if she meant that you will love the show and become a bigger fan than her or if she's afraid you'll like her physically less than the show you're watching.

What a strange competition!?", "NTA. \nMakes no sense why she would recommend you a show and then get butt hurt over you potentially liking it more than her. I\u2019d be more upset if my friend didn\u2019t like the show. \n\nUnless she\u2019s really childish, she\u2019s probably just faking an excuse to ignore you. It\u2019s ok if friends drift apart so you don\u2019t have to suck up to her to preserve a fragile relationship that can easily be broken over little things.", "Absolutely NTA. Weird friend.", "WTF\n\nNTA.", "NTA, but you need friends that actually take their meds.", "NTA. It must be extremely important to her to make her gatekeep like this. You didn\u2019t do anything wrong at all. I\u2019m sure she\u2019ll come around soon enough. Eta- and then you can share it.", "Did you make a typo with your friend\u2019s age?

Who cares who \u201clikes it more\u201d?  Your friend is weird and needs to grow up.", "NTA your friend sounds like a nightmare. maybe it was one of those \"you need to be smart to like this\" kind of shows and she was hoping she would be the only one.", "NTA for sure.  This is currently a big part of her identity, and she doesn't want to blend into a crowd of ppl liking her show. \"I liked that band before they were cool.\" \n\nGive her some time. Like, months. Then contact casually to hang out, and don't talk about show at all.", "NTA that is so strange and incredibly immature. What's going on with your friend??\n\nETA: I looked it up and am now watching it. Bet you I'll like it more than her!!!", "NTA.  I had to go back and check the ages.  Grade 5 sounds about right for this type of behavior.", "Your friend is nuts. The only reason to recommend a show is so others will watch it. And \"like it more?\" What is that?

Her comment about being scared that you\u2019ll like it more than her is so bizarre to me! \n\nNTA.", "Nah dude fuck allat tell her to get over herself and stop getting unnecessarily mad at something so damn stupid", "NTA - but I also don't understand the issue here? Why does she feel like she needs to like it more than others? What a weird thing to get upset over. What does it matter at all? I wonder what her reaction would be if you said you hated it lol is that ok for her? Lol", "NTA. A very wise therapist of mine who also counseled couples would always say that the most frequent complaint was \u201cs/he never does the dishes!\u201d And the therapist knew: the problem wasn\u2019t actually the dishes. The problem here isn\u2019t, I suspect, the show itself. \n\nThis is just a guess, and I could be very off, but maybe your friend wanted your group to experience the show in a different way - like, with her? Or maybe she had an idea that she would be more of an arbiter of the group\u2019s experience than she turned out to be? Idk. Either way, you did the right thing by asking a clear direct question about what was going on. Leaving you on read/playing games is all on her.", "That's something going on with their mental state, NTA; why would you tell someone a show is good and then get upset they watched it? \"How dare you not assume I have shit taste?\"", "NTA. The only way this behavior makes sense is if this friend feels closer to other people in your friend group and is so immature she\u2019s frustrated it was you watching it and not one of others.", "Why on earth does it matter which one of you likes it more?\n\nHer insecurity is very weird. But it's her problem, not yours. Don't keep chasing after her though.

Weird", "NTA. Your friend is batshit crazy. Forget her and enjoy the show.", "A grown adult is afraid you might like a show more than her.  A show, a TV show.  Good lord.", "NTA my friend did the same thing in high school. A lot of people attach their identities to the media they enjoy. Some people who do that feel threatened if someone else seems to do \u201ctheir thing\u201d (enjoying said media) better, or if they enjoy it more visibly. Not a red flag on its own, but that friend seemed allergic to my happiness in general, so we fell out in the end.", "You transposed the two numbers in your friend's age, didn't you?", "NTA. This person is weird. They wanted you to watch the show.", "lol this is so ridiculous, I don't even want to judge it. Maybe consider channeling your inner Orel in the \"Turn the Other Cheek\" episode", "NTA and honestly there's something bizarre & concerning about her being angry at you for this. Please also be open to others in your friend group about this weird situation, & how this is why you're no longer talking. Frankly despite knowing this person for so long, they might be a friend not worth keeping. \n\nGiven the extreme irrationality of their behavior, I again emphasize it's important to be upfront about this to your other friends. Frankly, it wouldn't surprise me if someone who behaves as she has might lie in a socially damaging way about why you're no longer friends.", "nice try but op won't fall into the same trap twice!", "I loved the book it was based on, 'creepy Susie and 13 other tragic tales for troubled children' ...it was.... not a book one should give one's children :D", "So strange! I love it when one of my friends or family members takes a recommendation and likes it too- more people to talk about it and fangirl with. The only downside is waiting for them to catch up to where you are without accidentally giving spoilers.\n\nEasy NTA", "What did OP do that makes them an asshole?", "Two weeks of texts with no response. Probably more to the last reply they got than OP is letting on... again it's described as a friendship. This doesn't pass the sniff test.\n\nIt's comical the NTA folks don't see the bigger problem with this supposed story. Believe OP all you want.", "she's an AH because... she tried reaching out to her friend?", "How many texts does it take to go from \"reaching out\" to they don't want to reply and OP should stop before it's harassment? Why wouldn't they want to reply?\n\nIs a TV series affinity more likely or is OP not saying the real reason. I'll go with the latter."]}
