I just hung up and focused on my Christmas decorations.\n\nNow my brother and father won\u2019t stop texting me telling me I\u2019m an AH, So AITA?", "created_utc": 1671686383, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zsd7ov/aita_for_not_getting_my_nephew_something_for/", "score": 226, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You set a reasonable boundary and are simply maintaining.  This kid is a stranger to you, and you to him.  While it is sad that your brother\u2019s family is suffering, it is not of your doing.  Your continued absence from a family that has not had a connection to you is simply maintaining the status quo.  You are right.    Father should be ashamed he raised a son who would do betray another, a brother, and destroy a relationship.  Brother is TA, forever.", "NTA. So it's heartless for you to not spend money on a nephew that you have had no contact with, but not heartless for your brother to go around cheating with your now dead ex?!", "NTA and apparently your dad is the reason your brother is such a narcissist. They didn't know what they did wrong? Now after years of LC he has the nerve to not even call and try to talk it out, but to make demands and make YOU out to be the bad guy? That's a whole lotta nope for me. Enjoy your holidays with the person that makes you happy and let your brother learn to be a man and take care of his own kid.", "NTA do what you have to for you. Not your responsibility to pick up the pieces if you arent in a place to. Id be curious what your response would be if there werent pressure from them\nthough.", "NTA. You don't have to have contact with your brother. You don't have to have contact with your nephew. In some cases, the passing of a family member is a catalyst for rebuilding distant or strained relationships. But it's by no means something your brother is entitled to.", "NTA. You aren't obligated to give anyone anything. If they demand it, it takes the whole idea of \"gift\" away, anyway. It would've been different if you were asked. But being pushed around about it, and eventually harassed for it, makes them big time AHs. The whole situation sucks, but it's not on you to fix it. The kid is young enough, anyway, that he's not going to notice the number of presents he'll have (and might have even more fun with the wrapping paper, tbh).", "NTA.  \nThey have sprung all this on you last minute. And your brother, I just can't, no brother should have done what he did. For him to be upset with you, again short notice, and to have any kind of grudge just shows how self centered he is.", "NTA\n\nYou aren\u2019t responsible for buying for his kid, especially if this isn\u2019t something you\u2019ve done the past few years. Honestly, it seems more like he is in a vulnerable and devastated state after loosing his child\u2019s mother. That\u2019s not your responsibility though, especially if you\u2019re LC.", "NTA\nCorrect me if I am wrong, but if you are LC with your brother that also means you have never met your nephew. You wouldn't even know what to get him in the first place. \nAnd if your brother doesn't know that Christmas isn't all about gifts then why is he even celebrating it. He should teach his kid that sometimes getting a gift isn't what matters. They're both mourning, he should just focus on healing and teaching his kid about correctly copping with lost than worrying about him getting a toy. You're NTA, and your brother needs to watch Tim Allen's Santa Claus, maybe he'll learn something about the holiday.", "NTA. Your brother made his choices now he can live with the consequences. He deserves only the same amount of effort he put in for you when playing around with your then girlfriend.", "NTA, you aren't seeing them for Christmas, you barely talk to them. Would your nephew even recognize you if you saw each other?\n\nHow is this your responsibility?", "NTA, I don't see why your parents can't look after your brother and their grandchild and host their own celebration.", "NTA... sleeping with your siblings partner tends to disrupt family peace. It's a pain I have no experience with so I'm sure you know how to deal with this best. Is it something you can someday forgive? I have no idea.", "NTA. Your family has been through a lot, but your brother was the direct cause of one of those things.  As such he gave up the right to count on you for support, period.\n\nLosing a spouse is devastating and their son must be a wreck too.  If Grandpa is so worried, he can buy the kid presents.  Or the deceased mother's family could step it up too.  Taking their grief out on you is inexcusable.", "NTA\n\nThat's a whole lotta nope. YIKES.\n\nEnjoy the life you have built that is filled with peace and love. \n\nLiving well is the best revenge after all.", "NTA\n\nI wouldn't give it or him a second thought the rest of my life.  Blocked, ignored, non-existent to me.", "NTA \nNarcissistic folks like to make their marks on holidays, so that's a sign that your brother may be one. So keep LC as usual, and enjoy your own Christmas peacefully", "NTA. A gift is a privilege, not a right.  Your brother knows what's up, no games.", "Your family is full of AHs but your not included. What a shit thing to do to your brother? He thinks just because she's gone that your suddenly going to forgive and forget? F that. Tell your father to BUTT OUT or he's going on the NC list with your brother.\n\nNTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It would be no difference than the pizza delivery guy giving this kid a gift. It's not even petty. It's just the outcome of his brothers betrayal. That's not on him.

Undoubtedly and he is rightfully paying for his actions with you cutting him off and no longer having a relationship with him. \n\nHowever,\n\nSins of the father and all that. \nYour nephew is a by-product of that betrayal, but this is a little dude who just lost his mum, he's a little dude whose life is now irrevocably changed forever and he's only what, 3 years old. He doesn't even understand fully what has happened. He doesn't deserve to get punished for what his parents did. Stay no contact with your brother, but don't tar your nephew with that same brush. Little guy needs all the family he needs now.", "This is a horrible take.

OP's pain is inconvenient for them so that can just be ignored.", "Going \"If brother is there, I'm sorry I won't be, but of course I'll send a gift for nephew\" is a compromise. \n\nGoing \"I'll be in his life, but it will only be if brother isn't there\" is a compromise\n\nWhere a child doesn't get rejected by family because of his dad's actions. \n\nIt isn't black and white.", "And you expect his parents to respect those boundaries? Especially when they asked if his brother and his nephew could spend Christmas with him? \n\nHer death didn't undo the betrayal or change their relationship.", "They asked. That's a respect of the boundaries. That is asking if those boundaries have changed under the circumstances. OP said they hadn't. They could've been upset, but they didn't try and trick the OP. \"They dropped it\" in his own words  That's fine, that's absolutely okay that they checked, and then understood it wasn't going to happen.  It's okay that OP still doesn't want anything to do with his brother, but it is pretty fair to assume that they would respect those boundaries as they already have and they're not even showing OP if they are upset. \n\nI'm not talking about the brother here. Of course her death didn't change that but I'm not talking about the act. I'm not talking about him keeping his brother out of his life. \n\nI'm talking specifically about him extending that anger to a child who has done nothing to deserve his contempt except exist."]}
