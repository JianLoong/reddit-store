I just hung up and focused on my Christmas decorations.\n\nNow my brother and father won\u2019t stop texting me telling me I\u2019m an AH, So AITA?", "created_utc": 1671686383, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zsd7ov/aita_for_not_getting_my_nephew_something_for/", "score": 39, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You set a reasonable boundary and are simply maintaining.  This kid is a stranger to you, and you to him.  While it is sad that your brother\u2019s family is suffering, it is not of your doing.  Your continued absence from a family that has not had a connection to you is simply maintaining the status quo.  You are right.    Father should be ashamed he raised a son who would do betray another, a brother, and destroy a relationship.  Brother is TA, forever.", "NTA. So it's heartless for you to not spend money on a nephew that you have had no contact with, but not heartless for your brother to go around cheating with your now dead ex?!", "NTA and apparently your dad is the reason your brother is such a narcissist. They didn't know what they did wrong? Now after years of LC he has the nerve to not even call and try to talk it out, but to make demands and make YOU out to be the bad guy? That's a whole lotta nope for me. Enjoy your holidays with the person that makes you happy and let your brother learn to be a man and take care of his own kid.", "NTA do what you have to for you. Not your responsibility to pick up the pieces if you arent in a place to. Id be curious what your response would be if there werent pressure from them\nthough.", "NTA. You don't have to have contact with your brother. You don't have to have contact with your nephew. In some cases, the passing of a family member is a catalyst for rebuilding distant or strained relationships. But it's by no means something your brother is entitled to.", "NTA. You aren't obligated to give anyone anything. If they demand it, it takes the whole idea of \"gift\" away, anyway. It would've been different if you were asked. But being pushed around about it, and eventually harassed for it, makes them big time AHs. The whole situation sucks, but it's not on you to fix it. The kid is young enough, anyway, that he's not going to notice the number of presents he'll have (and might have even more fun with the wrapping paper, tbh).", "NTA.  \nThey have sprung all this on you last minute. And your brother, I just can't, no brother should have done what he did. For him to be upset with you, again short notice, and to have any kind of grudge just shows how self centered he is.", "NTA\n\nYou aren\u2019t responsible for buying for his kid, especially if this isn\u2019t something you\u2019ve done the past few years. Honestly, it seems more like he is in a vulnerable and devastated state after loosing his child\u2019s mother. That\u2019s not your responsibility though, especially if you\u2019re LC.", "NTA\nCorrect me if I am wrong, but if you are LC with your brother that also means you have never met your nephew. You wouldn't even know what to get him in the first place. \nAnd if your brother doesn't know that Christmas isn't all about gifts then why is he even celebrating it. He should teach his kid that sometimes getting a gift isn't what matters. They're both mourning, he should just focus on healing and teaching his kid about correctly copping with lost than worrying about him getting a toy. You're NTA, and your brother needs to watch Tim Allen's Santa Claus, maybe he'll learn something about the holiday.", "NTA. Your brother made his choices now he can live with the consequences. He deserves only the same amount of effort he put in for you when playing around with your then girlfriend.", "NTA, you aren't seeing them for Christmas, you barely talk to them. Would your nephew even recognize you if you saw each other?\n\nHow is this your responsibility?", "NTA, I don't see why your parents can't look after your brother and their grandchild and host their own celebration.", "NTA... sleeping with your siblings partner tends to disrupt family peace. It's a pain I have no experience with so I'm sure you know how to deal with this best. Is it something you can someday forgive? I have no idea.", "NTA. Your family has been through a lot, but your brother was the direct cause of one of those things.  As such he gave up the right to count on you for support, period.\n\nLosing a spouse is devastating and their son must be a wreck too.  If Grandpa is so worried, he can buy the kid presents.  Or the deceased mother's family could step it up too.  Taking their grief out on you is inexcusable.", "NTA\n\nThat's a whole lotta nope. YIKES.\n\nEnjoy the life you have built that is filled with peace and love. \n\nLiving well is the best revenge after all.", "NTA\n\nI wouldn't give it or him a second thought the rest of my life.  Blocked, ignored, non-existent to me.", "NTA \nNarcissistic folks like to make their marks on holidays, so that's a sign that your brother may be one. So keep LC as usual, and enjoy your own Christmas peacefully", "NTA. A gift is a privilege, not a right.  Your brother knows what's up, no games.", "Your family is full of AHs but your not included. What a shit thing to do to your brother? He thinks just because she's gone that your suddenly going to forgive and forget? F that. Tell your father to BUTT OUT or he's going on the NC list with your brother.\n\nNTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You are NTA for maintaining a boundary, and for declining time together on Christmas. \n\nBut this toddler just lost his mom? With all due respect, the getting cheated on and heartbreak are nothing compared to that. Your brother seems awful but not getting an innocent child a small gift is also extremely petty.", "Hey! That one penny means that you are a professional writer.

If they expect him to be good, then OP's brother should've been good or at least respected OP in the first place. OP owes them nothing, not even the happiness of the byproduct of cheating.", "This child doesn't even know op. He has no responsibility here. It's not heartless. It would be no difference than the pizza delivery guy giving this kid a gift. It's not even petty. It's just the outcome of his brothers betrayal. That's not on him. His brother can buy his own kid gifts.", "And I bet he loved every minute of that box \ud83d\ude0a", "That's smart. I have a 2yo nephew and he's never excited about gifts.", "I didn\u2019t say OP owes the child anything, he doesn\u2019t. But it\u2019s still petty. OP should go to therapy if multiple years have passed and the sting of the cheat still burns that bad. If I was the new GF I would run. Lack of empathy seems like a whole ass family trait."]}
