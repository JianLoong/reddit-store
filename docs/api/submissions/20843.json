She is always happy and smiling, \"caring and compassionate\". My brother (37M) is foolishly in love with her, and it seems like the rest of my family is wrapped around her finger.\n\nMy brother and I (34F) grew up very close. When we were 10 and 7 years old, our father passed away, and our mother (69F) struggled as a single mother until she met our stepfather (65M), who is truly an amazing person. They had our little brother (25M), who happens to be Ella's best friend and the reason she met our brother.\n\n28 days ago, my husband (Mark, 34M) and I tragically lost our pregnancy at 22 weeks. It was devastating then, and it still is. I haven't been ready to talk to my therapist about it yet. This was our first pregnancy that progressed this far, so we were filled with hope. \n\nSince the loss, I made it clear that I didn't want to talk to anyone and that I didn't want any visits. However, Ella keeps sending deliveries of food every now and then with stupid ass messages like \"you are cared for\" and \"we're here for you\", \u201cthinking of you\u201d. It infuriates me to hear Mark commenting on how nice and thoughtful she is.\n\nLast night, she asked me if she could come over with my mom and my brothers to quickly discuss something about their wedding. She apologized, saying she knew it wasn't the right time, but the wedding is only a month away, and this conversation couldn't be delayed any longer.\n\nIn essence, Ella wants to postpone the wedding for another six months. It is a small affair hosted at a friend's place, and since she briefly explained the situation, the vendors are willing to change the date at a minimal cost. To paraphrase her, she said, \"I don't feel this is the best time to have a wedding. I really want you at my wedding party, and I suspect you won't want to be around people asking you what happened\" (as if she knows what I want or don't want).\n\nOf course everyone starting going off about such a great idea and how sweet that was of her moving a special date for her just to \u201caccommodating me\u201d. What it made me snap was what she said next \u201cwhenever you feel up to we could have a girls day to get you a new dress\u201d (mine was pink made specifically to fit my growing bump) \n\nI screamed at her that she was a C word for looking for sympathy at my expenses that I hoped my brother and everyone else could see her for the conniving and manipulative piece of work she was. That the only girls time I wanted to have is with my beloved girl that isn\u2019t with us anymore. \n\nAll of them were stunned and she ran out crying, my brother told me to seek therapy and mom and little bro just left. \n\nThis morning my husband told me that while he understood and share my grievance, I shouldn\u2019t lash out on innocent people. That she only wanted to help.\n\nSo Reddit I am the AH?\n\nEdit: fixed typos", "created_utc": 1687990797, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14ln0zj/aita_for_calling_the_c_word_to_my_fsil_after_she/", "score": 3182, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You seem to find her \"annoying\" because she is caring, compassionate, smiley, and happy, with no explanation of why any of those traits are negative. \n\nAfter you suffered a tragedy she stayed out of your way, and had food delivered with messages of love and supports, which is something that is very common for grieving people across many cultures. She asked for no acknowledgement as far as I can tell, and was doing this out of a place of pure love, and you took offense that this woman would dare be kind to you, and even got mad at your husband (who is also grieving the loss of a child) for expressing appreciation.\n\nIt sounds like she recognizes that you are very important to your brother, and should be part of HIS wedding, and that she also recognizes that you might not be ready for that yet. Maybe it was too forward to offer to reschedule, but it was a genuine kindness done for the benefit of you and your side of the family.\n\nFor all this she gets screamed at. You could have just said that, No, the rescheduling isn't necessary, and you don't need the food deliveries.\n\nI think there's someone being a \"C word\" here, but it sure isn't Ella.", "I guess I must be confused.

She was being nice", "YTA regarding your future-sister-in-law.\n\n\nSorry, but I couldn't made sense about the age of yourself and your little brother - you were 7 when your dad passed, your mom struggled as a single mother until she met her new husband, they have a son together who is just 6 years younger than you? So he was already 1 when your own dad died?\n\nSo...either this post is real and you got some ages wrong AND you are absolutely TA to your SIL (but I am sorry for the loss of the baby), or this is a shitpost with bad math..\n\nEdit: she replied that she made an error with the age of her brother", "YTA\n\nI understand that you are grieving, and it would be very valid to reinforce your boundaries around this.  It's not great that she keeps inserting herself into your space when you've asked her not to.\n\nHowever, it does seem like she's trying to include you and even rearrange her entire wedding to accommodate you, not \"trying to gain sympathy.\"  \n\nYou seem to be projecting some things onto her that might not be true.  I have not seen you show anything that is manipulative and conniving, just a bit fumbling and trying to push care where it isn't wanted.\n\nIt's not that hard to simply say, \"Hey, I see that you want to help, but I REALLY, REALLY need to be alone right now.  Please make whatever choices you think will be appropriate for your wedding, but I can't give you a timetable on how I'm going to deal with this grief, so I can't in good faith ask you to formulate your plans around me right now.

Ella is kind, considerate and that is a bad thing in your eyes. She has gone out of her way to make sure you are not forced to talk, be around people, etc and you screamed at her. She did nothing wrong. \n\nOutside of your grief you don't sound like a very kind person. Your reason for disliking her is that she is considerate of others per your comments. That's it. She is kind and considerate. Oh and she is always smiling and tries to he helpful. You called her what is considered the worst word you can call a woman and then accused her of being conniving and manipulative.

However, your pain is not an excuse to treat others as poorly as you did. What you did was disgusting and quite frankly if my SIL said this shit about me, she would not be in my wedding. She wouldn\u2019t even be invited to my wedding. She was being insanely considerate about your family and you and you called her a horrible name. You need to self reflect and if you really don\u2019t see that YTA then you need to seek help.", "Yes YTA why did you even shout at her? She did nothing wrong whatsoever. It was uncalled for.

I understand grief, and this type of grief is particularly difficult. However, you have got to stop treating your SIL as the scapegoat and cause of your misery. It\u2019s not right to do that to her, your family, or your husband. You need therapy to help you process this in a healthy way. From everything you\u2019ve described, she has bent over backwards to comfort you and make things easier for you because she is probably a genuinely kind person and also knows personally what you\u2019re going through.

When I know someone in my life is hurting, I will do whatever I can to stop their pain because I know how it feels to hurt. I wish I could prevent them from feeling like.. well, me. It sounds like your FSIL probably feels the same. She probably should\u2019ve talked to you about this privately and before she changed the date. I do think her heart was in the right place and she was concerned for you. Good luck OP", "I'm breaking this up because it is a mess. \n\nFor being upset that she pushed to be around you to talk about the wedding after you asked to be left alone, I get the frustration NTA. That could have been done via text\n\nNow, the yelling for her 'trying to gain sympathy' was totally an AH move. You clearly disliked Ella's well before now, and you really need to talk to a professional to dig into that one. She seems to genuinely give a crap, and if you keep pushing her away, you may find others will go with her, ie your brothers. \n\nI hope you get the time you need to heal and take the time to understand why this woman seems to get under your skin so much.", "It doesn\u2019t sound like you ever liked her, or took her for a sincere person. She was grieving her lost pregnancy too, and desperately trying to help any way she could. Get. Help. \n\nGrief gets you a NTA from me, but I wouldn\u2019t send an actually nice person within 10 feet of you and I feel incredibly sorry for Ella.", "NAH. You're still grieving, but lashing out at others isn't helping. You really should take up your brother's suggestion of therapy. Grief counseling is well worth giving a try.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.

She is always happy and smiling, \"caring and compassionate\". My brother (37M) is foolishly in love with her, and it seems like the rest of my family is wrapped around her finger.\n\nMy brother and I (34F) grew up very close. When we were 10 and 7 years old, our father passed away, and our mother (69F) struggled as a single mother until she met our stepfather (65M), who is truly an amazing person. They had our little brother (28M), who happens to be Ella's best friend and the reason she met our brother.\n\n28 days ago, my husband (Mark, 34M) and I tragically lost our pregnancy at 22 weeks. It was devastating then, and it still is. I haven't been ready to talk to my therapist about it yet. This was our first pregnancy that progressed this far, so we were filled with hope. \n\nSince the loss, I made it clear that I didn't want to talk to anyone and that I didn't want any visits. However, Ella keeps sending deliveries of food every now and then with stupid ass messages like \"you are cared for\" and \"we're here for you\", \u201cthinking of you\u201d. It infuriates me to hear Mark commenting on how nice and thoughtful she is.\n\nLast night, she asked me if she could come over with my mom and my brothers to quickly discuss something about their wedding. She apologized, saying she knew it wasn't the right time, but the wedding is only a month away, and this conversation couldn't be delayed any longer.\n\nIn essence, Ella wants to postpone the wedding for another six months. It is a small affair hosted at a friend's place, and since she briefly explained the situation, the vendors are willing to change the date at a minimal cost. To paraphrase her, she said, \"I don't feel this is the best time to have a wedding. I really want you at my wedding party, and I suspect you won't want to be around people asking you what happened\" (as if she knows what I want or don't want).\n\nOf course everyone starting going off about such a great idea and how sweet that was of her moving a special date for her just to \u201caccommodating me\u201d. What it made me snap was what she said next \u201cwhenever you feel up to we could have a girls day to get you a new dress\u201d (mine was pink made specifically to fit my growing bump) \n\nI screamed at her that she was a C word for looking for sympathy at my expenses that I hoped my brother and everyone else could see her for the conniving and manipulative piece of work she was. That the only girls time I wanted to have is with my beloved girl that isn\u2019t with us anymore. \n\nAll of them were stunned and she ran out crying, my brother told me to seek therapy and mom and little bro just left. \n\nThis morning my husband told me that while he understood and share my grievance, I shouldn\u2019t lash out on innocent people. That she only wanted to help.\n\nSo Reddit I am the AH?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I\u2019m gonna say soft you\u2019re a soft AH because you\u2019re going through a lot but you need to get to a therapist as fast as humanly possible.

I\u2019ve been around folks like that and they are incredibly irritating and make me want to say/do things that will get me banned from Reddit \n\nI was in a intro to construction program earlier this year and the program head noticed I was frustrated with things (I\u2019ve been struggling to find any job in the industry) and reached out to me which on the surface seems great right?\n\nI got the \u201cI\u2019m here if you need support\u201d and I told her \u201cthat\u2019s great, but your support doesn\u2019t pay my bills, your support doesn\u2019t get me a job, your support doesn\u2019t fix my ADHD.

You told them you didn't want to talk. People are not forced to to accept other's kindness or help.  \nFSIL could have had the best intentions, it does not matter. Her help was declined and she kept insisting.  \nYou should have talked with your husband about the way you felt about the food and messages.", "I think you are grieving the loss of your child.   I suspect FSIL was trying to be kind, but was clumsy about it, and it upset you.  I doubt she was actually trying to gain sympathy at your expense.  Could you have behaved better?  Maybe, but grief can affect our perception and actions.  Not sure anyone's at fault here.   I hope you can find peace.", "NTA.

BUT it seems VERY calculated.  Furthermore, that should have been said IN PRIVATE. \n\nno wonder why you snapped!!!!!", "NAH.\n\nI get it. I don\u2019t approve of what you said or how you behaved in front of your family but I do get it. You did not ask her to change her wedding date, and bringing your family over to your house to ambush you with an unwanted offer to display her flexibility and kindness despite you literally telling her you were not ready to see anyone- that was, whether intentional or not, something that would have bothered me too.

FSIL likely thought she was being helpful by offering the things she would have wanted or appreciated after her loss, but she\u2019s not respecting the fact that what worked for her grief isn\u2019t what you need.

I do think that you need help and you\u2019re calling her the Seaword and screaming at her was not an appropriate reaction.", "First off, I am so, so sorry for your loss. \n\nThere are no words that I or anyone can say to make you feel better. I know this because I\u2019ve lost my baby too. I know what that\u2019s like to miscarry. I know the absolute devastation you are feeling. I know the pain that is gripping your heart. And judging by the wording, I am going to assume this was not your first miscarriage and I\u2019m sorry for that too.\n\nYour FSIL was trying to help in the only way she knew how. She wanted to make life as easy for you as possible. She is trying her best.\n\nWhen I lost my baby, I was on my own, living away from my family. I didn\u2019t tell anyone but a few local \u2018friends.\u2019 I didn\u2019t have a spouse to rely on - he had left me before we found out I was pregnant. My so called friends did nothing for me.

Her incessant messages and deliveries were certainly annoying, but you're blowing things way out of proportion. The reaction you gave didn't really match the crime, and it's clear based on the way you speak about her that you had something against Ella to begin with. \n\nThe thing that also secures Ella in her position as an additional AH is that she had that last conversation in front of everyone to begin with. It should have just been between you, her, and your brother, so I agree she wanted people to see how great she was for being accommodating.", "NAH and tbh this may not be the right place for you. Clearly you have suffered a great loss that not many can truly understand. You are grieving, as you should.

It may not be welcome at present, but I don't see this as being with malicious intent.", "YTA. You\u2019re not emotionally mature enough for a child.", "NTA.\n\nI\u2019m sorry for your loss, OP.

Then, she brings up the fact that you\u2019ll need a new dress reminding you of the loss of your child all over again\u2014strike three. \n\nI know people like her, she\u2019s truly seeking attention under the guise of being a \u201cgood person\u201d. Your baby loss is going stealing all the precious attention she should be getting and that\u2019s why she\u2019s postponing. She also didn\u2019t respect your boundaries, so I would\u2019ve expected nothing less than you calling her the C-word.\n\nFamilies fight all the time, it happens.

You should go to therapy, even if you think you aren\u2019t ready. As you will never be ready. \n\nYou shouldn\u2019t have taken your frustration out on her. Maybe learn to vocalize your boundaries. Once she started leaving baskets with notes, you should have sent a quick message saying that you understand she\u2019s trying to be kind, but she\u2019s doing exactly what you asked everyone not to do. And it\u2019s not helping you. \n\nWhen she pushed to visit you to talk about her wedding, you should have said no visitors, and anything needed could have been said through texts. \n\nI know people like her. They don\u2019t even realize they are doing it. Or they do, and can\u2019t help but be cruel. The remark about the dress was cruel - and if your family can\u2019t see that, well maybe space is needed from all of them. \n\nAlso, for whatever reason you are not a fan of hers. And that\u2019s fine, but learn to vocalize it in a way where it doesn\u2019t sound like you are attacking her. We don\u2019t need to be friends with everyone. We don\u2019t need need to be besties with new in laws. But we need to learn to be cordial. \n\nI do think she was in the wrong, pushed boundaries and ignored your feeble attempts to tell her to stop.

There are no words to convey my sympathy.\n\nYou made a clear request to be left alone.  She violated that request over and over again.  Your family sees the \"nice gestures\", and she probably sincerely meant them to be nice and helpful.  But what none of them understand is was actually being incredibly disrespectful to your grieving process.  Those notes look nice, but when you're stated you want no contact they are actually incredibly rude and inconsiderate.\n\nAgain with the wedding, she might genuinely be trying to be nice...but she's going about it the wrong way.  She should have privately asked your husband to find out if you'd rather she postpone the wedding.  Your husband could have discussed it with you and given you some time to think about whether you wanted to attend the wedding now, later, or at all.  Six months might seem like a long time to her, but it's nothing at all to a grieving mother!!!\n\nThe last thing you needed was her pushing her way into your home, with your mother and whoever else, and going on and on about how she's changing her plans _for you_ when you didn't ask for any of it, and bringing up your custom made baby-bump dress was way too far.\n\nI understand why she's confused and why your family think you were being harsh...but none of them understand the loss you are feeling.  None of them are listening to you when you tell them what you need.  They are deciding what you need and want while disrespecting every boundary you put up and ignoring every request you make.

Then she brings people over to discuss something that in all honesty could have and should have been a private conversation between both of you first. Then she could have had a different conversation with everyone else without you there. Not to mention that everyone around including your own husband are complimenting her. While you\u2019re at your absolute lowest. You said that this was the furthest pregnancy you\u2019ve had. Which means you\u2019ve had more than one. Losing your shit is not the end of the world and in no way makes you an ass. But now is the time to talk to your therapist and when you\u2019ve reached a place apologize to your SIL.

I hope that you and your husband are able to move through this together. \n\nSeeing as you've been through something extremely traumatic, I'm going to try to be gentle about this. \n\nIt is extremely clear from your post that you have had issues with Ella from day one. The way you speak about her and your admission that you believe she is manipulative, in this instance, is a self report. \n\nThis woman has done nothing to indicate that she is faking her compassion. Usually, by now, you would see evidence of manipulation or interference. There is no evidence of this in her behaviour. You are projecting.  \n\nWhy are you projecting? Here's where it might get harsh. \n\nI have been in Ella's shoes. A now ex-friend of my partner could not wrap her head around my nature. She seemed personally offended by my affect, which is generally friendly, and my desire to assist people. Eventually, this led her to take what she thought was a chance at exposing me (when actually I was communicating with her the way I do everyone else) and told my partner I was being manipulative. Thankfully, he already knew she was full of shit and we worked through it together. That woman is no longer in our lives because she turned out to be manipulative and conniving herself. So, my point is, if you are so offended by the light this woman shines on you, no one else is concerned about her behaviour AND she has done nothing that would actually be considered manipulation...it's you, babe. You're the problem. You have trust issues and deep insecurities, and my suggestion is to have this discussion with your therapist. \n\nYour reaction to Ella, across the board, is unreasonable at best, delusional at worst. You've invented a character in your head and attacked her based on that. You basically invented a strawman and potentially damaged your relationship with the rest of your family. \n\nYou lack self-awareness. If you had some, you might have recognised the disconnect between what you were thinking and what you were actually observing.

However, I would feel best supported if ____.\u201d And explain what would make you feel best supported and cared for right now. It seems like you might have burned that bridge, though.

I\u2019m so sorry for everything and I hope you find peace and help.", "I don't want to say YTA because it's clear you're in a great deal of pain and grief can really affect the way we see things. The anger when grieving can be indescribable. I also know that some people can be performatively 'nicey nice' and that in itself is beyond aggravating when you're truly hurting. But based on your post, your SIL genuinely seems like she cares. It sounds like she was trying to show you that you're being thought of. It also reads as though perhaps you already dislike her, so at such a difficult time she can't really do anything right.", "OP, your pain is palpable. I\u2019m so sorry that you are experiencing this. I imagine that nothing feels like it will ever be ok. That\u2019s understandable. Happy, bubbly, thoughtful people don\u2019t help. They want to, but no matter what, nothing helps. I get that. \n\nBut your very real grief does not excuse what you said to her. Most people have no idea what to say and rely on useless platitudes. Or they don\u2019t know what to do so they do nothing and act like everything is fine. Ella did neither of those things. She communicated with you in a way that said she was thinking of you without the expectation of a reply. She did practical things to support you. This doesn\u2019t come off as manipulative. My view is that her desire to include you was so strong that she was willing to postpone a major life event so you could be there. Having her wedding now would put a spotlight on her and she knows you need all the love and support possible. And you responded by calling her c-word. \n\nPlease, please talk to your therapist.
