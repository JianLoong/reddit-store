He probably had about 6-7 drinks while we were out and then when the date was over he walked me to my car which was very sweet.\n\nWhat was sweet was that he went directly to a casino alone after leaving me and then got really drunk and called me at 2am begging to come back to mine to have sex \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "NTA, what a weird controlling thing to say.

You saw a friend at a bar and hung out with her AFTER your date.\n\nI can understand where your date was coming from in that something similar happened to my now husband on our first date.  We met at a casino in town because this way if the date wasn't going well, there would be other distractions. (We met online so there was no way to really feel the other person out until we met in person).  What I hadn't counted on was that one of my aunts would be there with her co-workers for a going away party or something like that. She comes over to where we are, says hello and introduces herself to my husband. My husband thought she was there because I saw it as a bad situation and needed her help getting out. Nothing could have been farther from the truth but, that is how he initially viewed her presence.  \n\nSo, perhaps this is how your date felt too??

If he thought she stayed at the bar to try and pick up guys or wanted to be the center of attention everything I said stands, and it doesn't mean it's because of \"sex\", it's just attention.\n\nI'm also not saying he's justified in it. He's a creepy guy and she's NTA for anything she did, but don't try to psychoanalyze just because you spend a lot of time on this sub.\n\nEDIT: I'm not going to keep discussing with you...just noticed you have a 3 month-old account and more comments than nearly anyone I've seen on this sub. You are **way** too drawn into the drama on this sub and not interested in actually having conversation.", "Even if it was a date, & not just meeting up with an actual friend - so not his business.

I had plenty of dates with younger women (let's say I was 35 and they were upper-20s) that actually said they'd rather drive closer to me.

It\u2019s very common for me to meet those friends near where they live because public transport adds so much extra time. They also don\u2019t want to feel like I\u2019m chauffeuring them around. If this is a first date he may also be trying to hide that he doesn\u2019t have a car because that may be a no-go for some people.\n\nHe also said he needed to go because he needed to be up early for work which certainly does not leave an open invite for OP to \u201cjoin.\u201d Being close to his place, if he doesn\u2019t have a car, would also probably allow him to stay out probably at least 30-60 min longer than he would otherwise.", "not everyone has a car bruh", "yep... developed brains is my sticking point too", "it also doesn't make it unhealthy?

When I was in the dating world I had plenty of dates right near my house because **I lived near cool places to go out**, and sometimes the women I dated didn't have anything near them they wanted to go to. I almost always would look up places near them and offer those first, but if you live in the suburbs or a small town that only has like 3 bars and those are the places you frequent all the time...maybe you don't want to take a first date there, or maybe you're just sick of the places.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe really don't know much about this situation at all, but that's why I'm saying  people need to take a foot off the gas a bit just throwing red flags at this guy just because they happened to go to a bar near him.

You\u2019re acting like this is a 30 year old trying to date a 17 year old. It\u2019s not, it\u2019s absolutely not.

They **are** both mature adults, unless you're calling OP immature, and the reason most older men pursue younger women is because a lot of men are very **visual** and physical creatures. I'm not justifying the practice, but to automatically make it seem like they pursue younger women because older women aren't interested is complete nonsense.\n\nI'm in my late-30s and happily married, but the number of younger women that try to hit on me or have little crushes on me is hilarious, and it's mostly because a lot of the guys **their age** are complete idiots, not because I'm doing something to attract them. My wife's only a few years younger than me and that works perfectly, in my opinion, but if you're my age and unmarried and a 25 year-old woman hits on you it's not always as easy to say \"well we're in different stages of life\" and walk away...a lot of guys, because people are terrible, just see \"hot woman\" and go for it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nStop making it seem like people are diabolical masterminds planning years ahead to take advantage of others...most of the time they're just stupid creatures going after their base physical needs and ignoring thought.", "And if it's not a pattern but a one off?", "Gonna have to disagree with you in a lot of ways here. Firstly, the guy turned out to be a creep for sure, let me go ahead and reiterate that point for the umpteenth time. Secondly, you don\u2019t know this man, you don\u2019t know his dating history, you don\u2019t know that he predatorily only approaches women X years younger than him, that\u2019s actually a really bold and silly assumption. \u201cPursuing younger women\u201d feels like a huge leap to me. I dated a 20 year old one time, it didn\u2019t work out at all because she was much younger than me and we were not in the same stage of life. Am I now a glaring predator because I did it once? I mean come on, you\u2019re making such a huge deal about the age difference without knowing ANYTHING about the OP or her date. Just think critically instead of with your bias.", ">They   \n>  \n>are  \n>  \n> both mature adults\n\nThat man is not even close to being mature. He checked on OPs bedtime.", ">f you're my age and unmarried and a 25 year-old woman hits on you it's not always as easy to say \"well we're in different stages of life\" and walk away\n\nAnd that is the fault of the less vulnerable and more experienced of the two.\n\nWhy are both men who insist on arguing with me about this men who feel the temptation or have done it before? Coincidence is a funny thing...", ">Gonna have to disagree with you in a lot of ways here\n\nChecking on your date's bedtime is not even close to \"mature\".\n\nAnd I never said men who do this are predators, At best I implied that many of them are losers.\n\nIf you want to place yourself in that category, that's a personal decision you can make as someone who thinks an almost 40yo man should be checking on his date's bedtime.\n\nI'm not gonna say there's no judgement for that though... \\[shrugs\\]"]}
