You can say something but don\u2019t hold onto any hope.", "NTA (I think) \n\nThere are a lot of comments about this being his money, not yours, he gets to say what he does with it, etc. All true, but he clearly intends for you to inherit a percentage of his estate - he put you in the will. You being concerned that this could change posthumously, given how the money moves if he passes before his wife, doesn't make you an AH. What would make you an AH is if you wanted your steps out of the will, or argued you should receive more than the steps, etc.\n\nObviously don't know your relationship with your father, so who knows how this would be received, but I think it's reasonable to talk to your father about the current will that doesn't leave anything protected for you or your brother. If it's indeed your father's intention that you and your brother receive a portion of his estate, he can set his will up so, should he pass before his wife, you two receive a certain percentage, with her receiving the rest. Otherwise you're right, there's no protection. Of course, you may want to tred lightly in this conversation, as you could be implying you don't trust his wife.\n\nAs a more general thought, speaking as a son and a father, I disagree with the general thought that children, adult children included, aren't obligated to anything from their parents. Parents choose to have children (in general, obviously there are exceptions to this), not the other way around, and that comes with responsibilities. I disagree that those responsibilities begin and end with \"food, clothing, shelter until you're 18.\" As parents, we have a responsibility to leave something of value to our children. Not every parent can give the same - some are able to provide intergenerational financial stability, some cultural values and morals, some unconditional family support - but parents do have the responsibility to give something.

After that step parent spends holidays with their bio family and the step kids do the same.
