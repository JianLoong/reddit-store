My wife had gotten A an Easter basket filled with candy and a few gift cards. My wife and I have always gave are our grandchildren an Easter basket from us. We have 2 daughter's and 4 other grandchildren (age 3, 5, 6, 6) so our other grandchildren besides A are all pretty young. \n\nThe last 4 days I've been on a trip for work and just got back today. I decided to get A a gift just because. It was nothing too big she just likes to draw so I got her a new sketchbook and color pencils I also got a card and some flowers. Usually my daughter\u2019s don't come to my house until the afternoon on Easter. I got back pretty early in the morning. \n\nWell as I pulled up everyone was outside. One of my daughter\u2019s came to the car and seen the card with A\u2019s name on it. She asked if I got A a gift and I said yes because there\u2019s no point in denying it. She started going on that A is the favorite and told my other grand kids that grandpa didn\u2019t give them anything only A. That caused the other grandkids to get upset. I told my daughter\u2019s i just wanted to get A a little something special because of what\u2019s been going on in her life.

Does she feel NOTHING about her brother, who passed eight weeks ago?! Has she no compassion at all for her niece?! \n\nI can forgive the children for making a fuss because they're super young and were instigated. \n\nBut your daughter is a huge AH.", "NTA. Your daughter on the other hand. Total AH. You sound like a wonderful grandparent trying to look out for the kid who has lost both her parents. Thank you for being so loving and kind. Best wishes for your family and I hope the extended family get some compassion.", "NTA. Your Daughters should have understood and they ATA here because they didn\u2019t. Just wow. \n\nOn another note, I wish you, your wife, and A the best. I hope A is getting therapy as she needs someone other than your wife and you.", "NTA.  Your other daughters should have understood and shut down those complaints from their children immediately.", "NTA. You will need to have a frank, no compromise discussion that makes sure your daughters understand that A is now no longer just your grandchild, but your child because you are raising her. Unless your daughters are no longer in the picture and you are raising their children, nothing will perfectly equitable again. You will raise your granddaughter as you see fit. \n\nYou did nothing wrong and I wish you peace and comfort as you grieve your loss and try to help A adjust. My condolences on your loss, that has to he unimaginably painful.", "NTA. Your other grandchildren wouldn\u2019t have noticed if your daughter hadn\u2019t started trouble.\n\nEdited to add: I\u2019m so sorry for your loss. I\u2019m sure this is a sad and stressful time for your whole family.", "NTA. That kid has gone through hell and you just wanted to get her something special. Your children should get that and use this as a teaching moment.", "You did the right thing. BTW, I found the cutest drawing book at Michaels\u2019 that uses letters and numbers to draw people and animals. It is so fun. Your granddaughter might enjoy it just as a relaxing activity. May your granddaughter have blessings rain down on her head.\n\nEDIT: The book is Christopher Hart Drawing Cartoons from Numbers and Letters.\n\nI have to say that we are all focusing on your granddaughter. I know you and your wife are living through almost unbearable grief. The absolute cruelty of your daughters is mind boggling.  A book that really helped me when my daughter died is Roses In December by Marilyn Willett Heavlin. Three of her sons died. When I read it I would think \u201cThat\u2019s how I feel!\u201d I wish only the best for you and your wife.", "NTA. You know what gift your other grandkids have that A doesn\u2019t? Living parents. I\u2019m pretty sure A would happily exchange the sketchbook for one of her parents, probably for just one more day with a parent. Your daughter was 100% the AH here and is acting like an insensitive, spoiled brat.\n\nETA: I am so sorry for your loss and glad that A has you and your wife.", "Nta. Difference between equal and equitable. Your kids should know that and use this as a teaching moment for their own kids", "I just want to say that I am so, so sorry for your loss\u2764\ufe0f", "NTA.  For god's sake, your granddaughter just lost her dad a couple of months ago and now she's an orphan.  Even though she's living with her grandfather and his wife, this is a traumatic time for a 15 year old.  You were just giving her something special, just for her. \n\nYour daughters, however, are being nasty little AH's.  No, make that BIG HUGE AH's.  You failed in one way, grandpa.  You forgot to teach those girls (now women) empathy.", "NTA but your daughter is a spoiled brat.  There's no harm in you giving a little sobering nice to the grandchild who lives with you WHO LOST BOTH HER PARENTS!    Your daughter is.... well, wow", "NTA\n\nThe girl\u2019s dad just died. If that doesn\u2019t qualify her for a bit of special treatment, I don\u2019t know what does.\n\nI\u2019m sure your other grandkids got extra Easter gifts from their parents. A doesn\u2019t have her parents anymore - you and your wife are filling that role now and it absolutely makes sense for you to get her a little extra if you want to.\n\nYour daughters are absolutely out of line.", "NTA. you live with the kid, and you expected to have more time to get the others something.", "You're NTA. You are not just A's grandparents, you're also her acting parents now. All your other grandchildren still have parents to give them those occasional, just because gifts. Your daughter is the one who decided to make such a spectacle of it.", "Your granddaughter just lost her father after already having lost her mother. The poor kid has experienced so much heartbreak in her young life already so good on you for trying to make this young teens life a little brighter. You are a good person who stepped up to the plate when like a good family member should in times like this \n\nNo offense to your daughter but how fucking dare she try to turn your other grandkids against you. That is some terrible selfish behavior she is setting for her children. Everyone should be grieving and she is throwing a tantrum? Im sure she did not learn this behavior from you but she needs to sort out her priorities. \nShe is the asshole\n\nYou sir are NTA", "NTA. Your daughter however ata, that is very immature and entitled behavior to purposely upset your grandchildren with that comment.", "NTA but your daughter absolutely is.  You are raising your granddaughter now and she is not equal to your other grandchildren because they have parents. She will be treated now more as a daughter and not just a temporarily visiting grandchild.  You need to have a serious conversation with her about her jealousy issues.  Who would do that to a child who just lost her only remaining parent???  You did nothing wrong, your daughter absolutely did though.", "NTA. You did not intend to give the gift publicly and you are now raising A, so she is a little different than a grandchild anyway. \n\nYour other grandchildren are 6 and under. A is 15 and just lost her only parent, I think getting her an extra personalized gift is sweet. \n \nYour daughter's are massive AHs. Do they resent you taking A in? I wonder if they think their kids will suffer as A becomes your priority (as she should)? Not that it excuses them but I feel like this is not just about the gift. However again they are massive AHs here.", "NTA. Your daughter is the asshole here for making a big deal about it. People wonder why kids grow up feeling entitled, well, there you go. \"If she got a gift, I should get one too\" even though there are clearly extenuating circumstances. She is an adult, and there are a dozen ways to have handled it that wouldn't result in the other kids getting upset. \n\nAnd, I am sorry for your loss, and for hers.", "Did your other kids all buy A a gift as well, a gift that is equivalent to the gifts they bought their own kids? A is pretty much your child now, and you as her guardians bought her a gift same way your kids would have bought their kids gifts. The fact that your obnoxious children are mad that you got A an extra gift is so disgusting. Are they serious? A lost both of her parents and they are mad that you might be playing favourites. UM YEAH, you should be playing favourites towards A at this point. NTA OP but your kids who made this a big deal are terrible people.", "NTA Ask your daughters\u2019 if they got their children Easter gift? Did they get any for A? Who is supposed give her a basket if not you? Should their kids get parent and grandparent baskets, but A only gets grandparent? I bet they hadn\u2019t thought about it from that perspective.", "NTA, A is your granddaughter daughter. You are raising her, so the relationship is different.", "YTA.  I get that her life has been rough but Easter wasn\u2019t the time to leave your other grandkids out.  You could have gotten them all something for Easter and, if you wanted to do something nice for her, do it on another day.", "YTA because let's he honest, you ARE playing favorites.\n\nBut really we all have favorites even when we say we don't. \n\nI guess you could have tried to hide it as you were pulling up\nYou just kind of got caught man haha", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

My 3 cousins received everything from my grandparents and there was no longer time for my grandparents to be grandparents to the rest of their grandchildren.   This really effected relationships as we all could see clearly we were no longer important.

Your daughter should be ashamed. She's showing envy towards an orphaned kid who just lost her only remaining parent 2 months ago...over a sketch book and some pencils. Honestly, there's no excuse.
