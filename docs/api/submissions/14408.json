Your other daughters should have understood and shut down those complaints from their children immediately.", "NTA. You will need to have a frank, no compromise discussion that makes sure your daughters understand that A is now no longer just your grandchild, but your child because you are raising her.

I know you and your wife are living through almost unbearable grief. The absolute cruelty of your daughters is mind boggling.

Who would do that to a child who just lost her only remaining parent???  You did nothing wrong, your daughter absolutely did though.", "NTA. You did not intend to give the gift publicly and you are now raising A, so she is a little different than a grandchild anyway. \n\nYour other grandchildren are 6 and under. A is 15 and just lost her only parent, I think getting her an extra personalized gift is sweet. \n \nYour daughter's are massive AHs. Do they resent you taking A in? I wonder if they think their kids will suffer as A becomes your priority (as she should)? Not that it excuses them but I feel like this is not just about the gift. However again they are massive AHs here.", "NTA. Your daughter is the asshole here for making a big deal about it. People wonder why kids grow up feeling entitled, well, there you go. \"If she got a gift, I should get one too\" even though there are clearly extenuating circumstances.

UM YEAH, you should be playing favourites towards A at this point. NTA OP but your kids who made this a big deal are terrible people.", "NTA Ask your daughters\u2019 if they got their children Easter gift? Did they get any for A?

Is your grandaughters grief nothing? Is yours? Even without these reasons... your kids just need to grow the fuck up.This is revolting behaviour and they should all be ashamed.", "NTA. Holy freaking crap. Did your family just hang up on your recently-orphaned grandchild?  The audacity. No compassion. I would have sent them all packing and told them that they can return right after they all apologize for being entitled brats.", "Keep loving your granddaughter and hope your daughter can get a grip. You\u2019re just trying your best in a situation that has no manual, no guidelines, and no right way to do things.", "I have an aunt like this it\u2019s my birthday today and I didn\u2019t even get a happy birthday\u2026 she never remembers any of my important events yet I always remember hers! And now it makes me feel self absorbed which maybe I am\u2026 but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s right\u2026 especially considering she is my aunt\n\nEdit: to clarify, when I said I don\u2019t think it\u2019s right I didn\u2019t specifically mean it because she is my aunt, but more for other things she has done in the past", "NTA -\n\nYour daughter was being a jealous b\\*\\*ch.  She hurt the other grandchildren by saying that in front of them.  She is jealous that A is being treated perhaps more like a child than a grandchild.  The other grandchildren still got their Easter gifts too, correct?  So why is it a big deal that A got a little something extra to cheer her up?  A lives with you, so does that mean every time you get her something that she needs, or a little something that you need to go out and buy something for EVERYONE else? no. \n\nWas this daughter jealous of her brother growing up? Was your son the \"golden child\" or favorite?  If so, your daughters frustration and jealously has now been transferred to your granddaughter.  You need to sit down with your daughter and ask her what her problem is.  Does she not understand that her brother has died which has left his child an orphan?  That it just so happened to be 2 months to the day that he passed and you wanted to do something to cheer her up?  \n\nYour daughter obviously has some issues, especially that she said you had favorites in front of the other, much younger grandchildren.  That was such a shitty thing to do.  I hope you & your wife can sit down with her and let her vent and explain what her issues are and hope you can resolve them.   \n\nI am so sorry for your family's loss.", "YTA. Would it have been that challenging for you to get your other grandkids a small stuffed toy for Easter? \n\nYou\u2019re obviously favouring one grandchild over the other. Your reason is solid, but it\u2019s still favouritism. \n\nYour other grandkids and children will realize this soon and stop coming around when they realize how much better \u201cA\u201d is treated than them.", "Wow, your daughters are incredibly selfish. Your granddaughter has lost both parents! Maybe ask your daughter if she\u2019d prefer her kids be the favorites- but they\u2019d have to be orphaned first! \nNTA.", "NTA honestly, A has probably kind of taken the role of a daughter to yall now as yall are raising her.", "Your grand daughter lost her sole remaining parent two months back and her aunt is stirring up the other grandkids over a small gift!!! God what an A H your daughter is!\nYou are NTA, OP and please spoil A silly. The poor child needs all the love in the world.", "NTA\n\nMy pettiness doth bubble over at seeing your daughter's callousness. I would've told her, \"I would be happy to get extra gifts for anyone who has lost both parents prior to college.\"", "Nta. I lost my mum a year a go in march and it didn't even hit me till the may when everything was finalised. 2 months later.\nThat poor girl is still processing that her while world has changed. Your daughter should be ashamed of herself. I assume that your granddaughter only came to live with you with the bare minimum as well. So buying her a few things to make her feel at home isn't a crime.", "This was the very first holiday since my son passed so we got her the usual easter basket and we were bouncing around ideas of possibly something more nothing too big just a little something extra which was exactly the gift I got her because I knew she didn't want something to extravagant just because of what happened to her dad but we wanted her to feel extra love from her grandma and I", "Life isn't fair, but the grandparents became the parents and of course they would give more everything to their now kids. Those kids needed parents and the grandparents stood up and took responsibility. I'm sorry you felt slighted, they maybe could've done better to their other grandkids, but it's difficult.", "It was meant to be given before everyone showed up, they were surprised and greeted at the car before they had time to hide it away. They didn't want to lie, something too many people do willy nilly.", "Great lesson from dad right there!", "I'm sorry for your loss. But I hope you gave that daughter a thorough talking to.", "But you also got your other grandchildren Easter baskets as well? Or did I read that incorrectly?", "I am just saying that the one who lives with you deserves extra presents from you and your spouse on holidays etc. As she doesn't have parents to provide them as the others do. I think that you are absolutely correct in doing so going forward", "Yeah they also got an Easter basket... It's something we do every year for our grandchildren", "My cousins' family had this weird kind of shift where the oldest 2 had kids very young, coupled with their siblings being staggered in age so the two younger were at that cusp of when college was more than a \"nice to have.\" So the older ones got married and joined the workforce in their early 20s while the cousins I am close in age waited until after college to get married and had their kids closer to their 30s. So the older cousins' kids missed out on doting grandparents because they were working to support college age younger cousins. Then my older cousins' kids got to college age and married so they had kids and the younger cousins were bewildered that suddenly their teenage kids were chopped liver! Grandparents were pumped to be great grandparents and the older cousins wanted to be involved grandparents so they didn't put all their energy into the teenage nieces and nephews. It took a while but the younger cousins saw the way they set up this \"everyone loves on the littlest ones\" mentality so that teenagers get shit on. But hey, does your kid want to babysit for free because *family helps family.*", "Then you absolutely did nothing wrong."]}
