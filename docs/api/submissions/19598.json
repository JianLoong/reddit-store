That\u2019s beautiful and wonderful and all that hippy shit but they\u2019re still stealing from you. It sucks because you even tried to open the conversation by saying it\u2019s okay, as long as you\u2019re asking. But I can\u2019t understand why they can\u2019t just ask.

So if she\u2019s cutting to the point of harm, not cool.\n\nI\u2019ve attended a couple of hands on seminars on cloning/propagating plants from cuttings. Doesn\u2019t quite sound what she\u2019s doing, but the \u201cstealing\u201d theme of most of the answers thus far is cracking me up just a wee bit because of learning it. One cutting, some growth gel, and you could have 20+ new plants, exact clones, of whatever variegated anomaly you are keeping - you know this, right? Do look into it, it was quite fun and can fill a garden pretty darn quick!\n\nNTA", "Clear cut.\n\nI see what you did there. \ud83d\ude02", "Of course she's stealing. Just because it's an accepted way of propagation doesn't negate the fact that she's taking a part of another person's plant without their permission. I.e., stealing. Just like saying pinching off a bit of a plant from a restaurant isn't stealing. Or grabbing a bit of vine off the floor of a greenhouse and pocketing it isn't stealing."]}
