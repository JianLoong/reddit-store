Dove always knew she wanted a spotlighted dance with both her parents and not just the typical father-daughter dance. When she told me this I decided to ask my sisters (24F, 23F) if they would do a spotlight dance with me after Dove and her family. They jumped at the chance and we started to practice. We know what song we'll be dancing to and we've pretty much got our routine down.\n\nMy stepmother asked me several weeks ago if I was going to ask her to do a mother-son dance at the wedding. She made it clear she had expected to be asked before that point and was asking herself because she was tired of waiting. I told her I was not asking her. She asked if I was really going to sit there and watch Dove dance with her parents and refuse to do one because my mom died 14 years ago. I told my stepmother that I was not going to just sit there because my sisters and I were doing one together. She stormed off after that.\n\nA couple of weeks later my father and stepmother asked me why I said I was dancing with my sisters when my stepsister (21F) and half sisters (13F, 9F) had never been asked. I told them I asked my two full sisters and the three of us were doing it together and my step and half siblings (I have a stepbrother and two half brothers too) were not included in that. They asked me how that was supposed to make them feel. My stepmother told me that her kids had always felt like they could not get close to my sisters and me because we had an impenetrable barrier between us and any other siblings who would have come into our lives. She said it was horrible that we lost our mom but our family grew and instead of coming together and leaning on having a bigger family, we kept it to just us and we have never viewed her kids as siblings in any real way. She said she has also tried her best to be a good bonus mother and we have never viewed her as anything more than the woman our father is married to.\n\nMy father said he felt like he failed us. I told him he had, repeatedly, and at least he was finally admitting it. I told him when you emotionally and physically abandon your three children who are on the cusp of losing their mother and continue to abandon them afterward, it is a failure to them and he should come to terms with that.\n\nThey said that was all true but be that as it may, it doesn't mean we shouldn't reach out to embrace and love the newer members of our family and the wedding dance could be a perfect way to cut step and half and just all be siblings. I told them I did not want that. They told me I was then worse than my father and my actions were more cruel.\n\nI should say this is the most we have spoken in years. I am low contact with them usually and they are not a big part of my life.\n\nAITA?\n\nEdited to fix a typo.", "created_utc": 1699987608, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17v959p/aita_for_planning_a_spotlight_dance_with_just_my/", "score": 103, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You said it yourself, you aren\u2019t close to them and are in low contact with them. It\u2019s entitled as hell for them to think they should get a special dance at your wedding.", "NTA. Its *your* wedding. Its really an expensive party that's all about you and your fianc\u00e9's future. So, the two of you have the privilege of designing what you want. (I don't really understand why this is so hard for some people to figure out how it works?)  Your stepmother can hire a venue and pay for the party if she wants to be featured in a dance. Its not her party to make demands about. She is a guest. Period.\n\nMy brother married a month ago. On the mantel above his head at the venue was a photograph of our dad. No one would have suggested to my brother that dad passing years ago meant his absence wasn't felt every single day. It wasn't a sad thing either. It was just the joy that we got him for a dad in the first place. So, your stepmother needs to check herself. *Your mother is still your mother.*\n\nWhy are you supposed to be responsible for her emotional baggage?", "NTA - your stepmother wants a pat on the back for being a decent stepmother and it looks like dad wants a public showing to absolve him of his emotional abandonment. \n\nPSA to all blended families: the time to show up is in the moment, not years later when the clout benefits you. \n\nI think the way you and your siblings are honoring one another is super sweet. I love this for you. Let your dad and stepmom choke on their disappointment. After all, they were totally okay watching you do same.", "NTA. I just don\u2019t understand people who feel entitled to stuff like this. \n\nI\u2019m a stepmother myself, and my stepson and I have a great relationship. But I would never expect a mother-son dance at his wedding because\u2026I\u2019m not his mother.

Real big of them to decide for you that your life event right now was the \"perfect way to cut step and half and just all be siblings.\" Nice try, attempting to hijack your time to make up for their shitty past. My father and step-mother got put on extreme low contact with my family after the last time he told me I should just apologize to my step-mother after she treated me like shit and was completely in the wrong because \"she's the mother\".

I told him he had, repeatedly, and at least he was finally admitting it.\n\nActions have consequences...I'm glad your father is realizing it.\n\nIt boils down to the fact that this is your wedding, your rules. They don't have to like it. \n\nI don't like that your stepmother demanded to replace your mother in a spotlight dance. That's ballsy and inappropriate especially since you've been low contact with them.  \n\nThis feels more about appearances for her. She wants everyone at the wedding to believe you are one, big, happy family. She wants the attention of being \"mother of the groom\". \n\nThe biggest losers here are your younger step-siblings. They don't deserve to be humiliated and cut out, they're pretty innocent in all of this, but your stepmother...she's kind of a piece of work.\n\nPerhaps you can do something special with your step-siblings separate from your sisters - maybe a special flower presentation to them sometime during the reception to signify you do care about them. I dunno. In the end, it's your wedding. You decide what's right for you.\n\nNTA.", "NTA What is the song?

Tell what you said when she said \u201cHow is that supposed to make us feel?\u201d\n\nYour step mother was brusque and mishandled it. But did you really do any better? You did invite them right? You wanted them there to celebrate and bring gifts even if you aren\u2019t that close to them, right? So why are you not handling this tactfully and imaginatively? Did you not think that maybe you owed it to your marriage partner to try to avoid cluttering up your celebration with unnecessary drama?\n\nIs your wedding really the occasion to punish people and sever relationships?
