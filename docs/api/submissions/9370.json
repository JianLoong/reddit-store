It sounds like a really rare car.  I suggest you reach out to an expert like Wayne Carini at F40 in CT or to look for an online group catering to your specific brand and hopefully model of car.  Car guys are friendly and with some photos should be able to point you're in the right dircetion for what it is worth or even a good local appraiser or expert.  Then you can offer it for the right price, if you like.  But provide a time frame as well and ask for cash on the barrelhead.  If you don't want to sell it to him you still need an accurate worth.
