I just had a lot of energy and I should have been a grandchild they spoil not an extra kid. \n\nThey love me and they did their best.  My father on the other hand was kind of a dick hole.  He would never spend time with me and when he graduated and later got married I wasn't even an afterthought.  \n\nThe cool stuff about my grandparents though was all their stuff.  My grandfather has a garage full of tools.  He does all the repairs on their vehicles and around the house  My grandmother has antique kitchen gadgets that she taught me how to use.  It was like growing up in a time machine. \n\nMy grandfather helped me build my first desktop.  He can do anything with his hands. He also taught me how to take care of his old car.  Him and my grandmother have regular cars but he also has an old muscle car.  It would not be out of place in the Fast and Furious movies.  \n\nI am getting married this summer and my grandparents decided to gift me the old car.  He always said he was going to give it to my father but I guess he changed his mind.  \n\n\nI asked my grandfather what bi could do with the car.  He said it was 100% mine.  I could do whatever I wanted.  Talked to my fiance. He said that it was a beautiful collectors item but not really something we could afford to keep.  \n\nWe decided we are going to have our wedding pictures taken with the car and then we are going to sell it.  We have talked to places that sell these cars and we will get enough for a good downpayment on a house.  \n\nMy father found out that I got the cat and he is mad.  He says it was supposed to go to him and he was going to keep it to give his son.  \n\nI said that if he got it appraised I would give him the right to buy it.  \n\nHe got it appraised.  He could afford it but not easily.  He says I'm being a bitch and holding his past behavior against him.  No shit Sherlock.  He abandoned me and now wants me to play nice.  \n\nMy fiance says we should find a compromise because my father wants to keep the car in the family.  I'm going to be honest.  I don't want my father or my half brother to get this car.  I would rather sell it to a stranger.  \n\nMy grandparents love the idea of wedding pictures with the car and then knowing that they helped us buy a house.  My grandfather said it was fate that he kept the car and never let my father drive it.  \n\nI have driven it.  It scares me.  I like my Nissan Leaf.  \n\nI do feel a bit like a jerk for keeping my father from getting the car.  \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1675781761, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10w3t65/aita_for_selling_my_fathers_car/", "score": 59, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Listen hard.  And then listen again.\n\nETA: don't trust your father's appraisal.  Get a second one, at least.  I wouldn't put it past him to give you a low-ball number", "This was the easiest judgement of my life. NTA 100x. Your sperm donor of a father has no say in what your grandfather does with the car. He gave it to you and explicitly said to do what you want with it. Not only that, but he supports your decision. I\u2019m not even going to waste my time outlining all the ways your father is an AH but I think you\u2019ve made that abundantly clear. Don\u2019t worry about what he thinks. Congratulations on your upcoming wedding!!", "NTA \n\nName your price, what YOU want out of it.\n\nIf he can meet it - IN CASH - then good for him. \n\nIf not, then congratulations to the first person with cash in hand willing to meet YOUR required price.\n\nGrandfather gave you the car, it's legally and morally yours to do whatever you decide.\n\nCongratulations to you and your fianc\u00e9, and good luck on the coming home search.", "NTA. Your dad can pay market value for the car.  From the sounds of it you harbor a lot of resentment towards him. I do not blame you.  He comes across as a petulant child.  I love that you got to drive it and he never did.  It is a petty victory, but my kind of petty.  Congratulations on your upcoming wedding. Is there such a thing as a car tax?  I would love to know what kind of car it is.", "NTA it's not past behavior if it's still the same behavior and your grandparents made this decision. Many blessings to your new journey.", "NTA. It's not your \"father's\" car. It was your grandfather's and he gave it to you. They are happy with what you plan to do with it. That's all that matters. Sometimes karma comes back with a vengeance.", "NTA - This is your grandfather's car. (Or yours depending on the current state of the title). His promise to gift it to your father is 1) not binding on you 2) not enforceable in any case.\n\nIf grandpa is good with your plans for it, then no one has no valid objection.\n\nYour solution of selling it to father at the appraised value sounds like a good one.\n\n(BTW, you aren't the only one holding him responsible for his past behavior, your grandfather is too. Your father is fussing at you rather than at his father only because you are easier to intimate.)", "NTA.  It's your car ergo it's your choice to do whatever you want with it.", "NTA\n\nIt's not his car no matter what he thought was going to happen, and it sounds like you have absolutely no reason to have contact with him.", "NTA\n\nHe wasn't a father to you.  You don't owe him a damn thing.  I agree 100% with you - if he wants it, he can buy it off you.", "NTA as long as your grandparents are cool with the plan don\u2019t worry. Congratulations on the wedding do what\u2019s best for you", "An easy NTA, especially since your grandparents approve and are pleased they are glad that they are helping you buy a house. As to your father and his son - tough. Maybe if he'd been more of a father he wouldn't be in this situation.", "Take the appraisal he gave you and add a few thousand to it, for sentimental value  He doesn't deserve to own it to begin with. Enjoy your wedding photos and new home, your dad can go get fucked. \n\nNTA", "NTA. The owner of the car gave it to you AND approves of your plans for it. Your fiance can stay out of this kind of family business. Your dad can kick rocks.", "NTA your father sucks don\u2019t you dare give him a single inch!!", "NTA.\n\nSell the car for as much as you can get for it to anyone who will buy it.\n\nYour dad is finding out that actions have consequences.", "NTA, your car, 100%. Your grandfather said so.\n\nDo the pictures,  sell it and tell daddy dearest to pound sand as he had his chance to be a decent parent. Your grandparents are ok with your plan and since it was theirs, I would think they get more say in what happens to the car than dad.", "NTA, I'd sell the car strictly on the basis that my father called me a b*tch. I wish you the best.", "INFO: did your father ever pay child support? Or did his parents' generosity render him so entitled that he believes he \"shouldn't have to pay for one nut without a condom\", no matter the consequences for other people?\n\nIf he didn't, not only do you owe him nothing, but he owes you. On top of all the father-daughter time he owes.\n\nI can't believe the audacity and I'm pretty sure this is grandpa's way of getting him to pay up in _some_ manner.\n\nNTA OP.", "NTA. It is a gift to you - end of story. Your bio father has no say and can pound sand.", "Nta. Your grandfather gave you the car not him or his son, if he wanted the car to stay in the family he wouldn't love the idea of you selling it for a house downpayment.You don't have to compromise or play nice with anyone regarding the car. Sell it like you want and buy a house for your future.", "NTA.  Take your pictures then sell.  It is yours to do as you wish.", "IMO, NTA.. what kind of car?", "It is your car, he can buy it for the appraisal price or let it go. NTA (You don\u2019t owe your spam donor anything)", "NTA\n\nYour dad, *the man who raised you*, was your granddad and the car belonged to him and he gets to decide who gets the car and as long as he doesn't feel disrespected by you selling the car, its yours to sell.  It was never your sperm donor's car. \n\nChannel your inner Jerry McGuire and yell at the sperm donor, \"SHOW ME THE MONEY!\"  \n\nMoney now or no car!", "NTA. I love when karma comes back for assholes. Maybe be petty and ask whoever you sell it to to send update pics so you can show your sperm donor. Lol. Congrats on your upcoming wedding and new home purchase!", "NTA and if the car is truly a classic muscle car in great condition, check out Mecum Auto Auctions and Barrett Jackson auto auctions.", "I think you're NTA, but it's still a bit petty if you won't sell it to him for a fair price. You wouldn't lose anything by him having the car.\n\nIf the car is worth a certain amount, you'd probably end up settling for less if you sold to a dealer. Maybe try and get more money from him than a dealer would pay, but he'd still pay less than if he went to buy it. You actually see some benefit then.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
