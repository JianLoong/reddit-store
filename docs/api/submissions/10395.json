Give the same thing your kid got nothing.", "NTA - No one is owed a gift\u2026.so it\u2019s not really about being a bigger person. If you want to give a gift, do so.

You don't need that in your life. Maybe your brother's next wife will be better.", "It sounds like you should be grateful when they don't show up for dinner based on the way his wife behaves. NTA. Gifts are never a requirement. If they come over and say something about stepson not getting a gift point out that you thought we had an unspoken rule about not having to give each other's children gift since you haven't given yours any in years. It's not about being petty its about meeting someone where they are at and putting in the same amount of effort as they are. Also I reject the notion that not giving a gift is some how punishing stepson because the implication is that stepson is entitled to a gift from  you. You are allowed to decide who you want to give a gift too. No one entitled to your generosity.", "Understood.  I stand by my answer.  If you're going to a children's birthday party, bring bring the child a gift.  Your brother is an adult.  If the two of you no longer exchange presents, that's a different issue.  He's old enough to understand reciprocity.", "NTA for not wanting, but please think about the feeling of a 5 yr old little boy who won't understand why he's not getting a present for his birthday  when other people do.  That's really heartbreaking for a child who has done nothing wrong--it's not his fault his mother and stepfather are total AH jerks.  Feel free to ignore your brother, but please get something for the child.  It doesn't have to be much or expensive--I like the 3D idea!--but something.  And if either of the adults say anything about the cost/quality of the present, feel free to let them have your uncensored opinions as long as the child is not around.", "NTA. Personally I wouldn\u2019t. He never bought anything for your son so why should you.", "INFO: why are they coming to your house instead of having the party at his house?  he could invite everyone there.  His wife should be the one preparing the party for her son and her husband.\n\nPersonally, I wouldn't allow them in my house.  Meet up at a park and have sandwiches.\n\nGo to a dollar store and buy something cheap.  Or a salvage shop.\n\nNTA.", "NTA If he's not getting your kids gifts, you should reciprocate in kind. If no one else's birthday will be covered by that dinner, you can also make plans to be somewhere else like he did for your son.", " NTA. Treat others like you would like to be treated and your brother isn\u2019t doing that. And if he asks, tell him exactly that.", "NTA. You have three choices.\n\n 1. Get them gifts.\n\n 2. Go to the party but don't bother with gifts for the kid or your selfish bother.\n\n 3. Stay home and do something fun with your own family.\n\n If it was me, I'd skip the party.", "The DNA / blood brothers comments aren\u2019t ok- they diminish adopted, donor and step kids.

And the brother being a prick.", "They are going to our parent\u2019s house where we have all of our family dinners.", "Nope.", "I was emphasizing the point that if you have no real love towards those who are actually related to you, why should you expect one of those who are related to you to share love to people they aren\u2019t related to??\n\nThe OP did not choose the family that his Brother married into. And again considering the lack there of consideration of OP from the brother, to the degree that (excuse me if this is offensive) the brother is using the family as if a welfare check.\n\nSure fine the brother can do whatever he wants, he doesn\u2019t have to give back the family that grew up with him; but then OP can do the same. \n\nYea I may have used too direct language for you, maybe this in-depth reasoning as to why my phrasing such as blood brother/DNA matter is relevant\u2026 As the OP and Idk the brother\u2026 are maybe just maybe, related by blood, which by default the OPs son, is aswell. \u270c\ufe0f", "That\u2019s a great idea.  It would be a shame not to give the 5 yr old anything because his parents act like idiots. No sense to making a kid feel less.

You see to be missing theirs. \n\nThose kids are \u201cactually related\u201d. The stress you\u2019re putting on the \u201cdifference\u201d between the kids related legally and those related by genetics is problematic and hurtful to donor conceived children, adopted children, and step children. \n\nThe comments you made are saying that any children not genetically related to both parents aren\u2019t actually related at all to the parent, and by extension that parents family, who doesn\u2019t share their DNA.\n\nA more accurate and less harmful way to phrase it would be to point out that OP has no *relationship* with the kids and definitely no relationship that\u2019s reciprocated. \n\nEither way, agree with the point about OP and the gifts you were getting at, even if I feel better verbiage could\u2019ve been used regarding not-genetically-related children.", "The kid is 5. Get a pack of crayons and coloring book. Wrap it & gift it. Your brother will get the message and the kid won't understand the dig, they will just know they got a present.", "It\u2019s not the child\u2019s fault their parents are awful, so I\u2019d get them something small that they would like, but also something that would be irritating to said awful parents.  I think slime would fit the bill here.", "Yeah, the brother is a piece of work alright. But that little boy is only 5. He doesn't know what's going on and it's not his fault.", "So it doesn't get gifts for your sister's kids either? Definitely NTA. You have been the bigger sucker, excuse me person for years already. How's that working out for you and your kids?", "NTA. It's never the difficult one expected to be the bigger person. Go to dinner and bring a box of chocolates to share or something, not as a gift,a contribution to the dinner.", "I absolutely love this!!", "Or go to the dollar store or Goodwill and get some cheap plastic toys.

It doesn\u2019t mean that the 2 step kids are less valuable than any other kid. But they are after all just any other kid.

Because people think blood means importance and legitimacy and by not having it, a relative lacks both. \n\n\u201cThey are connected just by a self serving marriage\u201d versus connected by what? Genetics. \n\nYou have some unconscious bias here that you aren\u2019t seeing. It\u2019s in each reply too.", "I think what they might want to say is that these children are basically strangers right now because they\u2019re never around and have only come to one event.", "So here\u2019s what you\u2019ve presented\u2026 I don\u2019t get it\u2026 because it shouldn\u2019t have more impact yet it does. As for my quote regarding the self serving marriage\u2026. You focused on the word connected, which was moreso a verb instead of an adjective\u2026 therefore it\u2019s not really the best pivot point\u2026 as you didn\u2019t deny the self serving part. As for unconscious bias\u2026 idk why you think it\u2019s unconscious. I have a bold and very clear bias towards keeping people you grew up with, feel like more than a glorified atm. \n\nIf you think focusing on the DNA concept, to make it seem that an adopted child isn\u2019t as valuable\u2026 the funny part is if you were to sub out that it was children involved, and make them adults instead, there\u2019s nothing wrong with what I said.\n\nBut oh my because they are kids, we should place divinity at all children\u2019s feet. My whole point is, the OPs child was treated as non existent, and unworthy of even a cheap present, by a family member he\u2019s known his entire life\u2026 but Ig because he\u2019s not adopted the fact his uncle hardly recognizes his existence is fine, so long as the newly adopted children are given value.\n\nHow bout instead of getting upset about words used, let\u2019s try to actually refute anything I\u2019ve said. \n\nTo this point, even with as holier than now those who have replied thus far feel they are at, none of you have actually logically proven anything I\u2019ve said wrong\u2026\n\nSo long as all the children are given equal worth\u2026 but fuck OP\u2019s kid ig"]}
