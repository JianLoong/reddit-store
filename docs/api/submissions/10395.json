You could take up some crochet and make some gifts like hats or something. I do this with my entitled family that feels they deserve gifts even though they never give gifts. If anyone were to ever complain that it is a \"shitty\" gift I flip that back on them and express how much time and care making something by hand takes, which makes them TA in the end. \n\nLazy route if you're not crafty: head to a goodwill and pick out some hand made stuff instead and act like you made it. \n\nMy family is full of narcissists and this works for me.

The brother and stepson are just 2 of them.", "That sounds like a great idea and will prevent a blow up(the last 2 Christmas have been amazing since I started doing this). \n\n3D printed stuff is really cool too so maybe it will give the kid something he cherishes for years and none of his friends have as well!", "OP I think while she's still SiL, I'd leave that branch of the family off your radar. You don't need that in your life. Maybe your brother's next wife will be better.", "It sounds like you should be grateful when they don't show up for dinner based on the way his wife behaves. NTA. Gifts are never a requirement. If they come over and say something about stepson not getting a gift point out that you thought we had an unspoken rule about not having to give each other's children gift since you haven't given yours any in years. It's not about being petty its about meeting someone where they are at and putting in the same amount of effort as they are. Also I reject the notion that not giving a gift is some how punishing stepson because the implication is that stepson is entitled to a gift from  you. You are allowed to decide who you want to give a gift too. No one entitled to your generosity.", "Understood.  I stand by my answer.  If you're going to a children's birthday party, bring bring the child a gift.  Your brother is an adult.  If the two of you no longer exchange presents, that's a different issue.  He's old enough to understand reciprocity."]}
