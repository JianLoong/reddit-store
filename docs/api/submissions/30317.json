{"id": 30317, "submission_id": "17nvlo5", "title": "AITA for calling my sister in law pathetic during a family dinner?", "selftext": "My fianc\u00e9, Chris (24M) is the youngest in his family with two older siblings, a brother (31M) and a sister (29F). I (also 24M) have one sister who is 9 years younger than me. I don't put much stock into the whole 'your birth order determines your entire personality' thing, but I do think it might enhance traits we already have. I've always naturally been a pretty quiet, even-tempered, nurturing kind of guy. I think I would still be all those things regardless, having a little sister when I did just amplified them. Meanwhile, Chris was very much the baby of his family. He wasn't spoiled, just taken care of in the same way my sister is.\n\nI've known Chris's family since we were 16. I've never personally had any problems with them, but I did witness a few fights between him and his sister over the years. The fights were always about Chris being a \"golden child\" and either getting more privileges/attention than she did, or getting similar privileges earlier in life. I stayed out of it as this was between the two of them. I didn't see the point in stepping into family dynamics like that, especially since I would've been a minor at the time arguing with a woman in her 20s.\n\nThis past Thursday night, we left on a weekend trip with his family. We left pretty late Thursday, we had already been driving for a few hours, and Chris gets hot/uncomfortable pretty easily, so he wasn't feeling too great. His dad went through a drivethru and as we were sitting in the parking lot eating, I asked if there was anything I could do to make him more comfortable. He had forgotten to unbuckle his own seatbelt, so I did it for him and just told him to relax and enjoy his food. His sister made some sort of comment about him getting coddled, but I took it as a joke and brushed past it.\n\nFast forward to last night, while we were out at dinner, it was uncharacteristically warm in the little restaurant we chose. Chris had worn a hoodie with nothing underneath while I was wearing a t-shirt, so we went into the bathroom to switch. It wasn't a big deal until, when we sat back down, his sister said \"Looks like you're still getting the golden boy treatment, huh?\"\n\nI'm usually not a confrontational person, but I was annoyed enough by the multiple comments. I said \"It's a little pathetic that you're almost 30 and you're still rehashing the same argument you had when Chris and I were sixteen years old.\" She ended up going to wait in the car while we finished our meal.\n\nIt's been tense since then and while no one has brought it up, I'm not sure if I overstepped. AITA?\n\nEDIT: The two examples I gave are not regular occurrences. As I said in a comment, to me these are just instances of me being considerate of my SO. Acts of service is big for me when it comes to expressing my love. He does the same for me (as we all should be doing for our partners!)

If he gets hot and bothered so easily, he would be the first to unbuckle his seat belt so as to get comfortable, and he certainly wouldn\u2019t wear a hoodie with nothing underneath it.

She's not saying this stuff cause she actually cares whether Chris is having problems with figuring stuff out himself, she's not being constructive, it's that she's still pissy about their childhood. She can be bitter (maybe rightfully so) but if all she's going to do is make comments like that every time they're together then OP is right in telling her it's gotten old.\n\nEDIT: also, isn't this an issue she should have with their parents?

You switched shirts with him because you knew he\u2019d feel better, as any loving partner would. And yes, after years of hearing the \u2018special treatment\u2019 crap, you called it out.

I\u2019m saying this as a middle child too, although me and my brother are only 3 1/2 years apart, so I was young when feeling these kinds of emotions and I still feel them today.

I also think you may have recognized the truth in what she said and got defensive. You may have known their family for years but you weren\u2019t in her family or experiencing life as a female child in that family. You don\u2019t get to invalidate her feelings or perspective. It\u2019s quite common for parents to be harder on/more protective on girls than boys. You don\u2019t just grow out of that truth when it happens to you. Plus, it does sound Chris is being coddled\u2026.by you now.", "NTA. Sister should take what she dishes out.", "NTA. Whether you coddle your husband or not is none of her business, that's between you and him. She's way overstepping and she deserves to be called out on it. Next time you can be even less polite.

His sister sounds jealous and very judgmental of her brother. I have also defended my dh against his family at time when his siblings were sniping at him and it rankled me. He doesn\u2019t need me to do this, but I\u2019m loyal and protective of those I love.", "Im getting such weird vibes from the way this story is told, something seems off here so I am leaning with YTA.", "Yta. You said yourself that you don't know anything about the dynamics of this family. Plus you're literally treating your boyfriend Luke a 5 year old child...", "NTA Your SIL is stuck in the past and probably a little resentful of seeing her younger brother in a loving supportive relationship. You keep being an amazing partner to your man. Her issues are hers to deal with.", "ESH she didn\u2019t need to make those comments but you\u2019re definitely coddling him", "NTA. It can\u2019t be \u201cgolden child\u201d treatment when it\u2019s coming from your significant other. These are things you should be doing for your SO. And apparently you\u2019re the same shirt size so that makes it easier for you to be courteous to your SO. His sister is jealous of him for whatever reason. And it is sad she\u2019s still throwing out the favored card at 30 unless his parents are truly favoring him. But if that\u2019s the case it still doesn\u2019t apply to you. Personally it sounds like she has or did have a crush on you honestly. I can\u2019t think of any other reason to say that to your brother\u2019s partner. And as an FYI, it\u2019s really easy to forget something like taking off the seatbelt when you\u2019re feeling uncomfortable the way your partner was. That was super awesome of you to think to unbuckle it for him. Hopefully you two have a long and blissful relationship!", "NTA.\nThe people that are bothered you were doing thoughtful and caring things for your finace should get better people in their lives. And examine their gender biases. Men can be taken care of too. When men take care of women like this, people can't praise it enough (rightly so) but of a man is taken care of like this then clearly he needs to \"grow up\" or other toxic BS. Sure, if it is never reciprocal or if hencan never take care of himself it is an issue, but even before your edit that was clear it wasn't the case.\n\nNo, it wasn't inappropriate for you to say something. If his sister is still upset then she needs to work it out in individual therapy and family therapy. And her beef isn't with her brother it is with her parents and it is rather awful she is taking it out on her brother who had no say in how others treated him and parented him. While unresolved childhood issues are a reason, they are not an excuse to treat people poorly in your 30s. \n\nBest wishes on your engagement.", "I have two thoughts about this:\n\n1) Your SIL does need to spend more time away from her family, let go of the resentment, and make her own life.  The only way to encourage this is positively, FYI, not through criticism and attacks.\n\n2)  If you're doing all these little things to make Chris comfortable and he's not doing the same for you, then you really are giving him the \"golden child\" treatment, and you're going to regret it, because he's going to expect that treatment for the rest of your relationship!  If you have a baby with such a person, they won't do their share of night feedings, instead, they're going to expect to be comforted because their own baby woke them up.", "NTA and I\u2019m so confused by all these Y-T-A votes. Is it wrong to be sweet to your partner?", "NTA. She shouldn't attack you and your partner's relationship, she sounds like a jealous kid.", "ESH. Both you and your future SIL made comments you shouldn't have said. But don't listen to the people criticizing the things you do for your fianc\u00e9. Those are things thoughtful couples do for each other. I'm sure Chris does the same for you.", "YTA, first, never get involved in a sibling argument, doesn't matter even if you get married you've still got to know your place as an \"extra\" to the family.\n\nMarriage does not make one \"true\" family.\n\nSecond, your opening paragraph is the old nature vs nurture debate and personally I think \"nurture\" is the stronger factor", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Lol what even is your assumption?\n\nI've got asthma, too, and unless I am actively unconscious, not even actively dying, will I allow someone to coddle me like that.\n\nLike, I've got my own issues, and I take my health independence too far, but a grown ass man having his partner undo his seat belt for him is some incredibly spoiled/coddled behavior. Like, come on. Can we stop infantilizing people in their early and mid 20s?", "YTA", "I agree, but I also think it's inappropriate to do that kind of thing in public.", "How is unbuckling his seatbelt for  him sweat rather than infantilising? I'd be mortified if someone unbuckled me", "I\u2019ve seen several people call this sweet and I find that so baffling. If any other adult undid my seatbelt for me I\u2019d have a number of reactions but none of them would be \u201chow sweet!\u201d", "I wonder if these considerate things op does for him will become chores and annoying after 20 years...", "The belt buckle was just a thing his fianc\u00e9 didn't notice due to discomfort and it probably not being a priority in his mind, so OP unbuckled it for his fianc\u00e9's comfort. OP also said the restaurant was unusually warm, so Chris didn't expect to be hot like he was, and again OP just offered to switch for the sake of comfort.\n\nTwo small things that would barely even register to me if I saw a couple do it. On top of this, going so far as to call it coddling is a bit much, especially when it does not matter if he's coddling him. The sister is in her damn 30s picking a fight with her younger sibling over his SO being mildly considerate.", "Except that he\u2019s literally here asking us to judge\u2026", "It\u2019s not inconvenient to go into a bathroom and switch clothes and know everyone noticed? That\u2019s about the most inconvenient thing I can think of. The man needs more consequences; who wears a hoodie and no shirt?", "Part of judging OP is judging whether or not the sister had a point. \n\nI personally wouldn't step into a sibling conflict this petty, but it is consistent with OP wanting to take care of his partner to a degree that is perhaps a little irritating if his partner is indeed the family \"golden child.\" But I can't really tell if that accusation has merit from OP's story.", "Then he would remember when he tried to move and was held down?", "How is it snide? Her perspective is that her brother is coddled. She stated this perspective to *her brother*\u2026.not his partner. OP inserted himself.", "That still doesn't make him a sibling. He should really  1. stay out of it and 2. Let Chris speak up if he has an issue.", "OP is joining the sibling squabbles! Just remember the other side of being a sibling, where your parents forced you to both say sorry and get over it, because honestly this conversation isn't worth the drama. Kudos for biting back, but now it is time to make nice and move on.", "As a personal furnace, layering is definitely better. I always take my hoodie off when we go to a restaurant and I'm fine.", "As a hot-blooded guy that overheats, button downs are the move. Wear wool ones in the winter and it\u2019s usually enough. Also thinner ones with no undershirt are cooler than a tee shirt", "He didn't cause issues for everyone. He and his fiance simply switched. It affected no one else.", "Oh damn, this is me too. I have lupus and my body literally tries to murder itself any time I go outside or even get too close to the window on a sunny day. I'm sorry you have to go through that too!", "Photosensitivity is awful. I just hide all the time and mine isn't that bad. I get hives, blisters, and high fevers from exposure. Hugs", "Hey there companion \u263a\ufe0f\nNo way, UV exposure is literally just the Sun !\nI\u2019m so sorry, that\u2019s rough :/\n(At least my solution was to move to a country with no summer and cold or at least non-hot weather) \n\nI do wish you luck, my friend in arms !", "For sure. Look up dysautonomia and mast cell disorders, you might have something going on. I personally have IST, EDS, and mastocytosis, but there are several other conditions in this area.", "The person I\u2019m replying said that Chris was old enough to control and regulate his temperature. \n\nMy comment about anaphylaxis is just to show him that this was such a stupid false logic. He is implying that if you\u2019re old enough, you can control your temperature. \n\nI\u2019m assuming you can see when you\u2019re getting an asthma attack, but I\u2019d be pretty confident to say you can\u2019t control it. \n\nAs your other points, have you seen couples on a night out where the bf gives his gf his shoes as her heels are hurting her. \nIs this practical ? Hell no, bf is walking barefoot on the street and his gf could have taken a pair of flats. But this is cute. Sometimes you don\u2019t realise your shoes will hurt you (or you forget to take your jacket and your bf lends you his). \n\nThese are sweet attentions. If you don\u2019t like being taken care of, that\u2019s also valid. But clearly op and his bf love it. Not my circus, not my monkey. It affects absolutely no one but them. If people don\u2019t like it they can mind their own business. The sister had no reason to insert herself. She appeared bitter and jealous.", "It does kinda sound like some insufferable-couple-friend storyline from a 90s sitcom that ends with Elaine Benes asking someone if a dingo ate their baby.", "Hey, my partner has done that for me!\n\n... When I was recovering from thoracic surgery and it would have been painful for me to do it myself.", "I thought it was more funny... like leaving glasses on your head or when your cellphone is in your hand and you can't find it... and looking for either of them ya know? \n\nI don't think it's a super deep thing here", "Thankfully you\u2019re not op\u2019s partner", "Or 5.", "god forbid allowing anything to be called weird lol", "Someone being nice to another person is never grounds for sniping. The sister is hanging onto childhood jealousy and her comment has no merit.", "The comment she made was both against her brother and op, since in her warped perspective op is doing the coddling now, she clearly has issues to resolve and is too immature to do it in a healthy manner, hence making little comments here and there like a petulant child.", "She's 30 and should've learned by now to take things she dishes out.", "Lolwut. OP was responding to a mean comment directly stemming from his own action that had nothing to do with her.", "well Chris apparently can't navigate unbuckling himself, so clapping back at his sister may be too much to expect. \n\nIn all seriousness, I agree that OP should stay out of longstanding sibling BS.", "Yeah, I'm a woman who runs warm but also goes between operating theatres (freezing), air-conditioned offices (fine) and a hot outdoors (up to the 40s C).\n\nLayering is the only way to go and button down shirts are life.", "I was just gonna say- check to see if they have an autoimmune!\nI have had that- the rash from the sum, but just on my forearms!\nDo you know how different dr\u2019s looked at me when I explained it- all kinda crazy- like I had 5 heads or was Medusa with the snake hair!", "It\u2019s terrible. Wishing you fun adventures in overcast locales.", "Yeah, it means dressing like Stevie Nicks all summer and I will probably never get the sunny beach vacation of my dreams. My dysautonomia prefers AC over actual winter, but godspeed in the frozen north, comrade.", "The same Elaine Benes who objected to exclamation points in regard to the birth of a child? How joyless and bland.", "I forgot the person might have actual medical reasons, in that case it is sweet lol", "Ah, maybe that\u2019s it. I still can\u2019t say I\u2019d find it sweet. Or that I totally get how you don\u2019t notice you\u2019re restrained when you don\u2019t want to be.", "Yes. Thankfully for everyone. But I don\u2019t think finding it a bit much is that weird an opinion.", "I mean, says you. You have no idea what she's experienced, what she continues to experience, what the dynamic is. OP is obviously and understandably biased in his partner's favour. If the sister has been watching everyone run around to solve problems for this kid his entire life, then her comment *has* merit, even if it is rude. You have no actual basis for judgment other than the account of someone who doesn't like her very much and literally loves her brother.", "Warped?! lol. Sure\u202624 year olds across the world need other people to unbuckle their seat belts because they\u2019re uncomfortable and take them to the bathroom to change their clothes. That\u2019s perfectly normal. /s  And no\u2026the comment was made to her brother.", "[removed]", "It wasn't a comment to him. Chris should have been given a chance to speak up without OP butting in.", "OMG! My 13 year old son has just developed an allergy to the sun. He gets hives if he is exposed to even a small amount of UV. How do you handle it??? It\u2019s been so rough on him.", "yeah I don't think it's particularly sweet either lol I did laugh tho", "I feel like you\u2019re questioning the existence of this reddit community. Who are we all but strangers judging the stories we\u2019re presented?", "Acting like unbuckling someone\u2019s seatbelt is such a hard and crazy task lol. You sound as bitter as op\u2019s SIL.", "\ud83d\udc80 Or how about don't start shit in where everyone sees an 30 year old woman acting like a rip-off mean girl? There's a time and place for everything, something she clearly needed to be reminded of because she clearly could do it before.\n\n\"a grown man treating his partner like a child\". \n\nNow you're just being dramatic over people's lives. Op said thats something he does occasionally, god forbid you like to do small things for your partner. \ud83d\udc80", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

Do people often remove your seat belt for you? \n\nAnd no need for me to be bitter. I can unbuckle my own seat belt if I\u2019m uncomfortable. I can also dress appropriately for the weather.
