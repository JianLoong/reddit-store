{"id": 30317, "submission_id": "17nvlo5", "title": "AITA for calling my sister in law pathetic during a family dinner?", "selftext": "My fianc\u00e9, Chris (24M) is the youngest in his family with two older siblings, a brother (31M) and a sister (29F). I (also 24M) have one sister who is 9 years younger than me. I don't put much stock into the whole 'your birth order determines your entire personality' thing, but I do think it might enhance traits we already have. I've always naturally been a pretty quiet, even-tempered, nurturing kind of guy. I think I would still be all those things regardless, having a little sister when I did just amplified them. Meanwhile, Chris was very much the baby of his family. He wasn't spoiled, just taken care of in the same way my sister is.\n\nI've known Chris's family since we were 16. I've never personally had any problems with them, but I did witness a few fights between him and his sister over the years. The fights were always about Chris being a \"golden child\" and either getting more privileges/attention than she did, or getting similar privileges earlier in life. I stayed out of it as this was between the two of them. I didn't see the point in stepping into family dynamics like that, especially since I would've been a minor at the time arguing with a woman in her 20s.\n\nThis past Thursday night, we left on a weekend trip with his family. We left pretty late Thursday, we had already been driving for a few hours, and Chris gets hot/uncomfortable pretty easily, so he wasn't feeling too great. His dad went through a drivethru and as we were sitting in the parking lot eating, I asked if there was anything I could do to make him more comfortable. He had forgotten to unbuckle his own seatbelt, so I did it for him and just told him to relax and enjoy his food. His sister made some sort of comment about him getting coddled, but I took it as a joke and brushed past it.\n\nFast forward to last night, while we were out at dinner, it was uncharacteristically warm in the little restaurant we chose. Chris had worn a hoodie with nothing underneath while I was wearing a t-shirt, so we went into the bathroom to switch. It wasn't a big deal until, when we sat back down, his sister said \"Looks like you're still getting the golden boy treatment, huh?\"\n\nI'm usually not a confrontational person, but I was annoyed enough by the multiple comments. I said \"It's a little pathetic that you're almost 30 and you're still rehashing the same argument you had when Chris and I were sixteen years old.\" She ended up going to wait in the car while we finished our meal.\n\nIt's been tense since then and while no one has brought it up, I'm not sure if I overstepped. AITA?\n\nEDIT: The two examples I gave are not regular occurrences. As I said in a comment, to me these are just instances of me being considerate of my SO. Acts of service is big for me when it comes to expressing my love. He does the same for me (as we all should be doing for our partners!)

She's not saying this stuff cause she actually cares whether Chris is having problems with figuring stuff out himself, she's not being constructive, it's that she's still pissy about their childhood. She can be bitter (maybe rightfully so) but if all she's going to do is make comments like that every time they're together then OP is right in telling her it's gotten old.\n\nEDIT: also, isn't this an issue she should have with their parents?

You switched shirts with him because you knew he\u2019d feel better, as any loving partner would. And yes, after years of hearing the \u2018special treatment\u2019 crap, you called it out.

I\u2019m saying this as a middle child too, although me and my brother are only 3 1/2 years apart, so I was young when feeling these kinds of emotions and I still feel them today.

I also think you may have recognized the truth in what she said and got defensive. You may have known their family for years but you weren\u2019t in her family or experiencing life as a female child in that family. You don\u2019t get to invalidate her feelings or perspective. It\u2019s quite common for parents to be harder on/more protective on girls than boys. You don\u2019t just grow out of that truth when it happens to you. Plus, it does sound Chris is being coddled\u2026.by you now.", "NTA. Sister should take what she dishes out.", "NTA. Whether you coddle your husband or not is none of her business, that's between you and him. She's way overstepping and she deserves to be called out on it. Next time you can be even less polite.

His sister sounds jealous and very judgmental of her brother. I have also defended my dh against his family at time when his siblings were sniping at him and it rankled me. He doesn\u2019t need me to do this, but I\u2019m loyal and protective of those I love.", "Im getting such weird vibes from the way this story is told, something seems off here so I am leaning with YTA.", "Yta. You said yourself that you don't know anything about the dynamics of this family. Plus you're literally treating your boyfriend Luke a 5 year old child...", "NTA Your SIL is stuck in the past and probably a little resentful of seeing her younger brother in a loving supportive relationship. You keep being an amazing partner to your man. Her issues are hers to deal with.", "ESH she didn\u2019t need to make those comments but you\u2019re definitely coddling him", "NTA. It can\u2019t be \u201cgolden child\u201d treatment when it\u2019s coming from your significant other. These are things you should be doing for your SO. And apparently you\u2019re the same shirt size so that makes it easier for you to be courteous to your SO. His sister is jealous of him for whatever reason. And it is sad she\u2019s still throwing out the favored card at 30 unless his parents are truly favoring him. But if that\u2019s the case it still doesn\u2019t apply to you. Personally it sounds like she has or did have a crush on you honestly. I can\u2019t think of any other reason to say that to your brother\u2019s partner. And as an FYI, it\u2019s really easy to forget something like taking off the seatbelt when you\u2019re feeling uncomfortable the way your partner was. That was super awesome of you to think to unbuckle it for him. Hopefully you two have a long and blissful relationship!", "NTA.\nThe people that are bothered you were doing thoughtful and caring things for your finace should get better people in their lives. And examine their gender biases. Men can be taken care of too. When men take care of women like this, people can't praise it enough (rightly so) but of a man is taken care of like this then clearly he needs to \"grow up\" or other toxic BS. Sure, if it is never reciprocal or if hencan never take care of himself it is an issue, but even before your edit that was clear it wasn't the case.\n\nNo, it wasn't inappropriate for you to say something. If his sister is still upset then she needs to work it out in individual therapy and family therapy. And her beef isn't with her brother it is with her parents and it is rather awful she is taking it out on her brother who had no say in how others treated him and parented him. While unresolved childhood issues are a reason, they are not an excuse to treat people poorly in your 30s. \n\nBest wishes on your engagement.", "I have two thoughts about this:\n\n1) Your SIL does need to spend more time away from her family, let go of the resentment, and make her own life.  The only way to encourage this is positively, FYI, not through criticism and attacks.\n\n2)  If you're doing all these little things to make Chris comfortable and he's not doing the same for you, then you really are giving him the \"golden child\" treatment, and you're going to regret it, because he's going to expect that treatment for the rest of your relationship!  If you have a baby with such a person, they won't do their share of night feedings, instead, they're going to expect to be comforted because their own baby woke them up.", "NTA and I\u2019m so confused by all these Y-T-A votes. Is it wrong to be sweet to your partner?", "NTA. She shouldn't attack you and your partner's relationship, she sounds like a jealous kid.", "ESH. Both you and your future SIL made comments you shouldn't have said. But don't listen to the people criticizing the things you do for your fianc\u00e9. Those are things thoughtful couples do for each other. I'm sure Chris does the same for you.", "YTA, first, never get involved in a sibling argument, doesn't matter even if you get married you've still got to know your place as an \"extra\" to the family.\n\nMarriage does not make one \"true\" family.\n\nSecond, your opening paragraph is the old nature vs nurture debate and personally I think \"nurture\" is the stronger factor", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

When he cooks for me, he reminds me, \"my girlfriend deserves the world\". When I'm too tired to clean with him (maybe 30% of the time) he insists I just chill out in bed and take a nap because he doesnt like me stressing out.
