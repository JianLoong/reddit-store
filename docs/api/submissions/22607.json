Usually her parents host the dinner parties and every time the sister's kid instead of eating what everyone else is eating, bitches and moans, screaming at the top of his lungs until his mother or grandmother get him either McDonald's or something like that.\n\nWell this time everyone suggested I host since I had just gotten a new place (everyone did this when they got a new place/moved out) and I get along with everyone pretty well so I thought why not. I came up with the menu and sent out the invitations specifying the menu and date, also noted that if anyone had any dietary restriction they should inform us beforehand(sent 10 days prior) so we could better accommodate them and didn't even think about that sister kid, since the grandma always takes care of getting him McDonald's anyway I shouldn't have to worry. \n\nWell comes the day of the dinner, everyone arrives, we're having some drinks waiting for everyone to be seated so we can start, said sister asks if I got her kid's order already, I get a little confused and tell her no, I thought she or her mother would since they always do and it's for her kid not mentioning I already payed for everything else. She gets a bit agitated and says her mother pays because she's the one hosting and I'm the one hosting so I should pay, I say alright and went on to serve the others and I could order while everyone was at least having their starter, she then interrupts me and insists we should \" wait until her baby's food gets here before eating \" (getting everyone but herself and her mother angry mind you), so I get on the delivery app and make the order an extra large one, when the food gets here I serve everyone but her then hand her the McDonald's bag, she asks where is her food i tell her it's in her hands, she gets angry and tells me she wants to eat what everyone else is having and that was just for her kid, I told her next time if she wanted to eat with the rest of the adults she should behave like one.\n\nTldr for the rest of the night: her mother and her left with their dad(who didn't want to leave) and they have banned me from their house effectively and called me an asshole demanding my Girlfriend dump me, the brothers and their wives all laughed their asses off the situation and want me to host again next time, girlfriend laughed but also said I was a bit of a \"justified ass but still an ass\", AITA?\n\nLittle update: girlfriend went back home (she still lives there) and her mother and sister are 100% set on forcing her to breakup with me, her father seems to have our back but doesn't want the drama of openly going against his wife, girlfriend is moving in with me as a result, her father is helping me move her stuff out whenever the mother is out of the house in the coming week.", "created_utc": 1689721093, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/153daww/aita_for_not_serving_the_same_food_i_served/", "score": 1037, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Good chance, her dad and brothers would too.\n\nEven if they didn't have great relationships with your GFs sister, they would have been hearing stories of \"[ex] did this\", \"[ex] did that\" etc. Stories to gain sympathy and support for the sister.\n\nThat only her and her mom know why suggests that the reasons are really about her, not him. That thise reasons coming out would lose her sympathy and support with the rest of the family, not gain it.\n\nIt probably also suggests that at least with mom, she was the GC, the \"chosen one'\", well before the divorce. That mom knows the truth because sister knew mom would support her not matter what, regardless of what she might have done to torpedo the marriage. Because as you said, to mom \"she ... can do no wrong\".", "Im glad to hear this. I\u2019m still smiling to myself at your response. It was perfection.

They aren't doing him any favors by catering to his demands. If he has real issues with food, mom needs to figure out a healthy option for him *and* provide it.

Babysitter option should not include McDonald's.", "NTA\nSerms other family members are sick of her shit too", "Nta. I feed my kids before we go if I suspect they won\u2019t eat what\u2019s served.

That really did make me laugh.", "NTA. \n\nGF\u2019s mother should have stayed out of this foolishness started by her oldest daughter. \n\nGF would likely have moved in with OP regardless but her mother tried putting foot down and instead GF is moving in with OP sooner.  \n\nDouble win for OP.", "Shitty thing is one of the brothers mentioned the kid is completely fine, like he did a bunch of psychiatrists and all that and they couldn't find anything wrong with him, he's just spoiled and they refuse to stop enabling him.", "At that age it'd be a tough job straightening that mess out. And mom has no intention of setting it straight. Grandma is as bad giving in to both of them.\n\nNTA - Harsh but fair. Honestly if she wants her kid to have special food she needs to provide it, not expect the host to order her kid a special meal. Unless he is Neuro-divergent there isn't a justification for all that mess. If I acted like that at someone's dinner table I'd have been lucky if my mom didn't take me over her knee in front of the crowd.", "Invite him alone. He might sneak out.", "ESH. It is pretty obvious why the sister is entitled and rude. However, OP was the host and did not provide any kind of food for the child. You asked if they have any dietary requirements or special needs and they didn't give you any. That means they expect to be treated the same as everyone else. Now if the hosts decides on their own the kid will get McDonalds (as they did in this case), it is on the host to organise and pay for that. If you require the guests to bring something, it is on the host to advise the guests of that, especially as this was the first time you have ever hosted. It would have taken so little effort to ask your gf to find out if sister was planning to being McDonalds or did they need to provide the child dinner. I have to wonder if he doesn't like sister or the child so prioritised to one upping the sister than to doing his best to ensure dinner would go smoothly for his gf's sake. I really hope not as that would make him an AH boyfriend as well as a poor host.", "NTA.\n\nFirst of all, They cannot expect everyone to give in to their kid\u2019s demands the way they do. And even with that nonsense demand, they could still have been a bit adult and called in to confirm what they\u2019re expecting. The Child is a child But those adults aren\u2019t adults at all! \n\nAnd even if you\u2019re an justified ass, it still is a minute issue for anyone to force your gf to dump you over! And the daughter (your gf) is moving out because of this and it\u2019s still not enough to know them into their senses!? I think they\u2019re not just L people but also L parent and sibling.", "I agree with your girlfriend, Yes for sure your a bit of an ass, but justified. Her sister is TA here", "NTA \n\nSIL deserved that. She and the mother are also not doing the child any favors by normalizing the behaviour and eating habits - not your problem, but amybe the girlfriend could point that out?", "Considering McDonald is the only acceptable food for a 8 year old child... And not event from USA? I'm really curious, what other country can have such a bad relationship with food?", "Not only that but the parents didn't answer to the special requests/preferences to op 10 days prior.", "on a side note honestly it is sad though that you are at a family event, and your SIL just lets her children get away with eating mcdonald\u2019s. I feel terrible for the child, because as it sounds they can\u2019t hear the word \u201cNo\u201d and the SIL probably lets them do whatever they want at all times. That child will have a real wake up call when it\u2019s older", "Ever see the movie \u201csupersize me\u201d?  This child is going to have a short life if all they eat is McDonald\u2019s.", "so this is yet another AITA post about a golden child ? come on....", "My mom fully had me so trained by the age of 4 that I was able to go to a fancy wedding with my grandma and I apparently behaved myself so well. All I remember of the wedding is getting a white polar bear beanie baby from my grandma but my mom likes to tell me how good I was as a kid. But my grandmas friends apparently loved me because I was a little doll and so well behaved.", "And the gf dad too alone. NTA op", "ESH - your response to her behavior was just as childish.", "ESH. Yes, your SIL was being demanding but your reaction shows a level of immaturity to be honest. There was no need for you to order McDonalds for the SIL, she clearly didn\u2019t request it for herself. You could have refused to order for the kid and insist the kid eats the food that was prepared. If they had still left then you would be NTA.", "NTA that was brilliant lol. Bonus for getting the trash to take itself out.", "NTA That kid is 8yo. Needs to be put in his place. Tell him no more order outs. He eats what everyone else gets, or he goes hungry.", "ESH but you're justified AH", "YTA", "This is incredible, good for you. NTA. I would never expect anyone to buy my kid McDonald\u2019s because they\u2019re picky eaters. Bring snacks like every other parent in the world or come prepared.", "NTA! And omg that's awesome. So perfectly fitting.\n\nGood in you sir. You two are going to create and ama8home together.\n\nAll the best to you! \ud83d\ude0a", "NTA, but a bit of an ass.  Though completely justified.", "How did you pull that off with a straight face? xD", "NTA", "NTA - good for you. That\u2019s an awesome response haha", "NTA. Your SIL should know better that she doesn't get her ways all the time! I like what you did here. Petty!", "LOL. Yeah, YTA, but a good sort of AH. The SIL is totally and AH who deserved what she got. LOL.", "NTA, hope Sil got a happy meal!", "NTA that's hilarious. I'm glad your girlfriend is on your side on this but tbh even if this was breakup time in 6 months when you were over it, it'd still be a hilarious story to tell people", "People in normal, healthy, happy families don\u2019t post here about their families."]}
