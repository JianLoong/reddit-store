She gets a bit agitated and says her mother pays because she's the one hosting and I'm the one hosting so I should pay, I say alright and went on to serve the others and I could order while everyone was at least having their starter, she then interrupts me and insists we should \" wait until her baby's food gets here before eating \" (getting everyone but herself and her mother angry mind you), so I get on the delivery app and make the order an extra large one, when the food gets here I serve everyone but her then hand her the McDonald's bag, she asks where is her food i tell her it's in her hands, she gets angry and tells me she wants to eat what everyone else is having and that was just for her kid, I told her next time if she wanted to eat with the rest of the adults she should behave like one.\n\nTldr for the rest of the night: her mother and her left with their dad(who didn't want to leave) and they have banned me from their house effectively and called me an asshole demanding my Girlfriend dump me, the brothers and their wives all laughed their asses off the situation and want me to host again next time, girlfriend laughed but also said I was a bit of a \"justified ass but still an ass\", AITA?", "created_utc": 1689721093, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/153daww/aita_for_not_serving_the_same_food_i_served/", "score": 304, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Good chance, her dad and brothers would too.\n\nEven if they didn't have great relationships with your GFs sister, they would have been hearing stories of \"[ex] did this\", \"[ex] did that\" etc. Stories to gain sympathy and support for the sister.\n\nThat only her and her mom know why suggests that the reasons are really about her, not him. That thise reasons coming out would lose her sympathy and support with the rest of the family, not gain it.\n\nIt probably also suggests that at least with mom, she was the GC, the \"chosen one'\", well before the divorce. That mom knows the truth because sister knew mom would support her not matter what, regardless of what she might have done to torpedo the marriage.

They aren't doing him any favors by catering to his demands. If he has real issues with food, mom needs to figure out a healthy option for him *and* provide it.

Babysitter option should not include McDonald's.", "NTA\nSerms other family members are sick of her shit too", "Nta. I feed my kids before we go if I suspect they won\u2019t eat what\u2019s served.

Yea, she had that coming. Op is NTA", "NTA", "The kid already sounds like a nightmare. The mom certainly isn't doing herself any favors.", "Or those reasons are embarrassing to the SIL.  Many victims of abuse are embarrassed or hide that they were abused for the very reason that many people will judge them.  \"Why did you stay with them?\"  \"Why couldn't you see what was happening?\"  \n\n\nIt's possible something incredibly shitty has happened to SIL and MIL is compensating hard for that.", "Kid's probably not his..."]}
