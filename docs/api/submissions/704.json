On top of that my friend was unable to be there as he had other plans\n\nShe was fine with it but then asked if I wanted to meet before or still go with my plans with my mother and 2 brothers (1 she\u2019s spoke to on video call a lot) so ideally it would be her first time meeting my mother. I said to still come and out of nowhere she was going on about how she would feel a burden accusing my mother of asking her things(keep in mind it\u2019s their first time meeting) and she\u2019ll be messing up the night and the thought of the idea was almost near death. which is when I tried to reassure her (otherwise I wouldn\u2019t of asked her to be there) but that didn\u2019t work. It took me a while to understand but I was quite upset & hurt not only was it on my day but that my plans again got dismissed and we would have such little time together as she already had plans with others the next day she was up here. It was like it was her way or no way I didn\u2019t feel like she was here for my day at all as she\u2019d spend more time with everyone else and have such little time with me not even the full day I didn\u2019t feel like a priority.

Why after? it sounded like a way out plan for her to not be there if she was scared of my the time of greeting my mom wouldn\u2019t it makes sense if she didn\u2019t want to stay in my house so their paths wouldn\u2019t cross? (genuinely not meaning to sound ignorant). I was also quite upset that she was accusing my mother of disliking her and that she was going to bully her. that I felt was rude imo.
