{"id": 29730, "submission_id": "17h4m5v", "title": "AITA for telling my mom I don't want to feed their pets when they go out of town anymore?", "selftext": "My mom (44f) recently asked me (26m) if I could drop by their house and feed their cats (5 cats) this past Monday and Tuesday while her and my stepdad went out of town for their wedding anniversary. This is the 4th time she's asked me in the last 4 months. Historically, she asks about 4-8 times per year for 2-3 days at a time for the last 5 or so years with the exception of 2022 since she had 2 surgeries. My mom lives about 25-30 (one way) minutes away from me and feeding their cats only takes about 5-10 minutes max. I recently just graduated from grad school this past May and got a job as a Data Scientist with a big bank.\n\nNot only do I work on weekdays, but the commute is usually 45m-1hr one way to the office (I go 2-3x a week). I also have a rather strict workout regimen where I lift 4x per week (M, T, Th, F) and do cardio 1-2 times per week - usually on my off days. I really hate missing a workout because I feel like if I have the attitude of \"it's only one workout\" I'll start to make that excuse more often - which I don't want to do. I also tend to cook 2-3 nights per week during the week as I'm trying to reduce the frequency in which I eat out since it isn't as healthy and it's expensive. As it is, between working, working out after work, showering, I don't usually get home until 6:30-7:00pm.... and then I usually cook dinner afterwards.\n\nI have suggested in the past to my mom that she get a pet service or pay someone to do it but she says that she doesn\u2019t want to pay anyone and doesn\u2019t trust someone she doesn\u2019t know well in her home by themselves.\n\nAfter I told my mom that I would do it this time but I can't do it anymore going forward - she completely blew up on me... Saying things like \"Wow, really\" and \"This has cut deep and hurts more than you know. But I now have a better understanding of my place in your life. This exact reason is why I don't ask favors from anyone, it just leads to disappointment and a pretty fucking lonely life.\"\n\nTo make matters worse... I had just received news that my grandpa(81m, also my moms father) was in the hospital at the time with aspirating pneumonia as a result from a stroke he suffered a year ago and was only given days to live since he could not swallow anymore. At the time when my mom asked me, I didn't know about this but she did.\n\nTo give more of a background, my mom and I lived with my grandparents for 18 years and I have much more of a mother-father relationship with them than I do my mom. They cared for me, signed me up for sports, took me to doctors, and even put me through undergrad and grad school - so I was obviously devastated when I heard the news about my grandpa as he's like my dad.\n\nI feel like it's very selfish of her to expect me to do it every time when I'm working full-time and much busier now, in addition to doing it while my grandpa is in the hospital when that's time I could be spending with him during his final days. He passed away yesterday. I'm not sure if I'm the one that's being selfish or not bc of how she reacted...

It is, however, very selfish to ask, and then not like your answer. You're doing her a favor. \n\nAlso, you have even responded with \"Yes this time, but not going forward\" so you're not putting her out last minute, you're giving her ample time to plan ahead. \n\nI will point out that.

Lots of people have full-time jobs, or families to care for, or exercise to do, or dinner to cook, and still choose to help their loved ones when they need them. It also wouldn\u2019t be selfish for you to ask a family member or friend with a full-time job for a favour. \n\nHowever, it *is* selfish to repeatedly ask someone who has already said they can\u2019t perform the favour. Whether I personally think your reasons for being unwilling/unable to perform the favour are reasonable is irrelevant: you have made your position clear and she has ignored it, and that simply isn\u2019t fair to you. \n\nRegarding your grandfather, I\u2019m very sorry for your loss.

I mean, if they are asking this every week or something, yeah I can see it getting tiresome.   If this is a once every 6 months or so sort of thing,  kinda don't see the issue here.", "Her response is what I call \"emotional terrorism. \"\n\nNTA but my mom has been like that my whole life and I finally put a stop to it. Went full No Contact. She doesn't know where I live or work and her number is blocked.

Especially when they take you for granted, and act like you're horrible for no longer letting them take advantage of you.", "NTA Your time is valuable to you and your mom should understand that.\n\nYou can get automatic cat feeders on Amazon. Fill the tank with dry cat food and it feeds them on whatever schedule you set. You can also get cat water fountains that do the same thing. They also make self-cleaning kitty litter boxes. My daughter uses these when she's out of town and they work great. She does have someone go by and check on them and her house like once or twice a week when she's gone but whoever that is can go on their schedule, not the pets.", "NTA.

I've posted this before somewhere else. I get paid minimum $100/week for looking after pets. Food, enrichment, walks, treats, companionship.

That is a long way to drive on a workday when you already commute, and you are not leaving your mom hanging, just giving her a head's up that this no longer works for you. She should be able to work something out with a friend or a neighbor who has cats or dogs, a trade off that doesn't cost anything. I don't even have pets, but my husband and I still help our neighbors who do because it would be silly for someone to have to drive over and feed a cat or let a dog out for a little bit when we are here. Neighbors pick up our mail and check on our house when we go out of town, so it always works out.  Again, I am very sorry for your loss.", "NTA. There are services that visit homes to walk dogs, feed cats, even stay in the home while you're out.

She needs to find a neighbor who can help.  I know my kids loved pet sitting for our neighbors.", "NTA. It's an inconvenience, disrupts your life and you've done it a lot in the past.

That's pretty shitty for close family.", "Sure hope you don't need anything if you can't even feed cats without complaining.  It's an hour of your time for 2 days. You say you won't do it going forward.  Well okay. Don't ask for favors from your folks. Selfish ass people in this world that can't help out... preemptively. \nESH", "NTA. Your mother is being selfish with your limited time. There are services and pet sitters for this and for most people, that is part of a vacation expense. This is an extra hour of driving every day for you and her requests are now frequent. You can explain you are there to help in an emergency--thats what family is for, like if the pet sitter didn't show up. But to expect you to do a JOB so she can save money on a vacation--that is over the line. And her response is obnoxious.
