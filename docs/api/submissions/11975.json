All of them were super excited. My family is very close to my husband and has been super involved in our lives. We go on vacation with them every year, see them multiple times throughout the year and they actively check in on us. His family on the other hand is estranged. We see them all once a year (thanksgiving) and it's very awkward every single time. The only reason we are invited is because they want help with funding their feast. They don't like my husband and have been telling me to leave him and save myself since I got together with him (he was severely depressed at that time and had no goals- he's much different now but they still hold it against him years later). \n\nIt's important to note that we had become pregnant years ago and miscarried. None of his family was excited and when they found out we miscarried they said it was \"for the best\". So this time around I truly don't care if they know. I don't care to tell them. I don't like them as people and I certainly don't like how they treat my husband. To be quite frank, I could go my entire life keeping my unborn child from them people and sleep soundly at night. They shit talk my husband to everyone so I guarantee they will do the same to our kid. \n\nSo after we told my family my husband said something about \"now we have to figure out how to tell my family\" (because we did a special announcement to my family with lots of planning). I said \"how about a FB post\". He asked why my family got a special announcement but his doesn't and I said \"we can do a special announcement if you want but I don't see the point because they won't be excited and they will not care, just like the first time around.\" I wasn't trying to be dismissive about it but I guess I kind of am in the same sense because his family aren't good people. And as I said, we can make a special announcement for them but I truly think it's a waste of time and effort. He says he's hurt that I'm so dismissive and maybe a special announcement will help them see he's not the man that he used to be. So he's wants to do it for approval, whereas I think it's a waste.

It seems to be important to him to at least try.", "NAH - I understand your point of view, but you need to realize that he still loves his family.  Despite everything, and in spite of the way he's been treated.  He is hoping they will be excited.

End of story.", "NAH for both of you  in terms of how  you feel, but this is a situation where you need to consider your husband's feelings even if you think it doesn't matter to his family.  And if he wants to do a more formal announcement, you should go along with it without being overly negative about it.", "NTA, your reasoning makes perfect sense. But your husband is still pining for approval. I am no kind of doctor but maybe doing a special announcement and having them not care will help him see they aren't worth the trouble.", "NAH (except the in-laws).\n\nI understand wanting to protect your husband from his shitty family, and your husband understandably is desperate for their approval after all these years.\n\nBetter to let him get hurt now when there isn't a brand new baby for him to offer up as a carrot on a stick; then you'll have the rest of the pregnancy to pursue therapy and work on ground rules.", "NTA. Does your husband see a therapist? It sounds like his family is toxic and he needs a come to Jesus moment because you are right. His family will treat your child the same way as him. What you said was blunt but not an A H. Your priority is making sure your child grows up in a loving environment. Might be time for husband to realize low contact and no contact may be what is best for your child and his mental health.", "Humor him for the announcement, why not?

Your husband seems determined to get his families approval but it might not happen. I have been through it and the best thing you can do is just support his decisions. If he wants the announcement, he does it. All the planning and work. You just say what can I do to help. That way if it works or fails, he can see you supported him.", "Info: who did the bulk of the planning to tell your family? \n\nImo if you did most of the planning to tell your family, nothing wrong with him doing the same for his.

You don\u2019t care about them. I wouldn\u2019t either.

Solidarity.", "Gently, YTA. I've been in your shoes and I get it--it really hurts to see the person you love most being hurt repeatedly by those who are supposed to love him as family. You see they aren't going to change, and you don't want to go through the cycle yet again where he gets his hopes up just to be hurt again. You know that, ultimately, the only way to stop the hurt/heal is for him to grow, face the truth of who they are, and make his own decisions/manage his expectations accordingly.\n\nBut, trust me, you do not want to be the one who forces him to see them as they are. He will in time, his own time, come to realize who they are and that they won't change. It is an incredibly painful truth to acknowledge though so look at his hope with as much compassion as you can muster and support and love him when they inevitably let him down again. You want to be a place of love, warmth and support. It's like when someone is in an abusive/toxic relationship--telling them to leave doesn't really work. Building up their self esteem, being a confidant, and reminding them that they deserve better treatment is more effective. \n\nThat being said, make sure you are aware of your own boundaries and your own feelings. You absolutely should set your own boundaries to protect yourself and preserve your ability to also provide support to him.

Why exactly weren't his family supportive of your first pregnancy?", "No judgment. But if you don't let your husband have his moment, then you will be ta. And don't say told ya so when they do what you expect. Just comfort him.", "NAH. You probably see the in laws for who they are - cruel people not worth keeping in your lives. But it's much harder for a son to come to that realization. So even if you are correct and it's for the best to keep them at arms length, if your husband wants to do this, let him. You don't have to help (though he would probably appreciate if you did). If they have the reaction you expect, you can gently tell your husband I told you so and work to cut them out more permanently. If he is right and they are pleased for you both, maybe the relationship improves slightly.", "A soft YTA: Since it's his family he should have a major say in how your joyous news is shared with them.\n\nIt sounds like he still has hope that his family can be loving and supportive. You're probably right, but let him try one last time to connect.  Plan something fun for his family (doesn't have to be expensive) but let him know how they react will determine how much they get to interact with the child in the future.", "NTA for feeling that way, it's hard to hear someone you love be put down.   Also what they said the first time about the miscarriage was really horrible.   \n\nPlease get yourself and husband some therapy, he's obviously living in a dream world or your not seeing that their trying.   A few sessions and you'll be on the same page.  You two deserve happiness.   \n\nPS Contrat's and blessings for a healthy baby", "Your husband seems to need therapy if he still wants to be involved with his family after what they put him through.

My family, absent my sister, will probably always see me as a fuckup because of my battles with depression in my teens and 20s. I\u2019m doing lots better now and my wife and I are very happy. We\u2019re happiest when we\u2019re not dealing with my family at all! But it took a long time and a lot of work for me to accept that that\u2019s who they are and that there\u2019s nothing I can do to change them. \n\nI think you\u2019re completely justified in dropping the rope with your husband\u2019s family. I wouldn\u2019t organize a single thing for an announcement. But you should support your husband if he wants to do so. Will the upcoming birth of your child be the thing that salvages their relationship? Almost certainly not, but he has to learn that for himself.", "Are you doing something wrong by not making a special announcement for the monsters who cheered your miscarriage?? No, OP. NTA. They don't deserve anything on this front.", "NAH, but the person you're affecting most with the decision is your husband. He apparently is not OK yet with letting his family go completely, and you trying to force it just puts you in the position of villain.\n\nMaybe he would benefit from some time with a counselor to work through his feelings about them.", ">he was severely depressed at that time and had no goals- he's much different now\n\nIsn't it amazing what actual love and acceptance can do for a person. You two sound like a lovely couple and I'm glad he's found a true family with you and yours.\n\nThat said, if it means something to your husband, you should honor that and make telling his family something special...because you love your husband, not because they deserve anything from you. \n\nNTA for feeling the way you do but could cross over to AH territory if you remain dismissive.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

This is about your husband and the fact he's proud to be a father and want to announce that to his family in a special way.  Just like how you had your moment and felt special he wants the same thing. \n\nThe problem isn't you not caring, it's that after he expressed his feelings to you, you look at him and say fine but it's still a waste of time......why would doing something to make your husband happy be a waste of time?", "NAH. Your feelings are understandable. Hella. But it's his family. I say let him do it his way and maybe this time their indifference will get through to him.

That said, for many that simply never happens.  It doesn't keep us from trying.  This may be what your husband is doing and feeling.  Yes, you are being dismissive.  His family relationships are his and HE has to come to his terms in his time.  The fact that he wants to do something a little special to announce this to his family should be given serious consideration.

His depression was severe and he often attempted to un-alive himself.

His best friend has just died and it destroyed him. He got in to drugs, drank every night, cried often. So when we first got together he had gotten clean almost immediately and stopped all that but they saw him as broken and a bad influence.

Maybe the loathsome in-laws will change and give him the approval he craves but if not, it might show him that he really doesn't need them because they really don't care about him or his life.

On the positive note, he has a new family now that DO love and need him.", "With all due respect, I will not be treating his family the same manners after they've treated us like outright garbage for years. They don't deserve the same treatment and no one with a stable head would say that. I accept your judgement 100% but these people deserve nothing. I told my husband I would do an announcement, as I said in my post at least twice.

I'm guessing she is already the one carrying the baby.", "You\u2019re totally unsupportive though. He suggested it and your first sentence in response is to shit on the idea? How awful. You are super unempathetic to your husband. You were totally dismissive as he said. You said you would be the asshole because you want to protect his feeling so instead you decided to hurt him before they could?", "It won't make a difference to THEM, it will make a difference to your husband and that is what matters.", "I mean all of this boils down to what his relationship with his family was like originally -  were a loving family pushed to their limits by years of your husband's ongoing behaviour or if they are just callous Aholes who never really cared?\n\nI'm going to suggest a point of view that might be completely wrong, but might aslo be an outside perspective:  Threats to unalive yourself are serious.  Constant substance abuse is serious.  It takes its toll on the family suporting that person, the late night calls, the distressing conversations, the panic because someone is threatening to un alive themsleves.  At some point that family realises they can't help anymore and ends up shutting off because they can't put themself through that level of emotional turmoil incessantly.  It's too much.  They give up because they don't know what to do and they are at their wits end.\n\nYou experienced your husband at his worst very briefly did it very briefly before your husband got better - his family had been doing it for years and couldn't do it anymore. You have mainly experience\n\nNow you visit once a year, and they are still scared that the old version of your husband is going to show up.  And a nice family meal is going to turn into something a lot more sinister.  And now so much time has passed that you are all basically strangers, there\\\\'s no much pain and history \n\nI ahve no idea if that could be what happened, or if his family are findamentally just assholes who caused all his issues in the first place.  But this is bigger than a fancy announcement.  If your husband wants to reconnect and rebuild bridges, and if his family weren't the cause of his issues in the first place, then you need to be supportive.  Have boundaries, have limits, but also allows him to try to reach out. \n\nWhilst they have a lot of making up to do to you, it sounds like he has a lot of making up to do to them as well.", "good to see you ignoring your husband's wishes concerning his family.", "This shows how little you care for your husbands feelings.
