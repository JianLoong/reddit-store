We go on vacation with them every year, see them multiple times throughout the year and they actively check in on us. His family on the other hand is estranged. We see them all once a year (thanksgiving) and it's very awkward every single time. The only reason we are invited is because they want help with funding their feast. They don't like my husband and have been telling me to leave him and save myself since I got together with him (he was severely depressed at that time and had no goals- he's much different now but they still hold it against him years later). \n\nIt's important to note that we had become pregnant years ago and miscarried. None of his family was excited and when they found out we miscarried they said it was \"for the best\". So this time around I truly don't care if they know. I don't care to tell them. I don't like them as people and I certainly don't like how they treat my husband. To be quite frank, I could go my entire life keeping my unborn child from them people and sleep soundly at night. They shit talk my husband to everyone so I guarantee they will do the same to our kid. \n\nSo after we told my family my husband said something about \"now we have to figure out how to tell my family\" (because we did a special announcement to my family with lots of planning). I said \"how about a FB post\". He asked why my family got a special announcement but his doesn't and I said \"we can do a special announcement if you want but I don't see the point because they won't be excited and they will not care, just like the first time around.\" I wasn't trying to be dismissive about it but I guess I kind of am in the same sense because his family aren't good people. And as I said, we can make a special announcement for them but I truly think it's a waste of time and effort. He says he's hurt that I'm so dismissive and maybe a special announcement will help them see he's not the man that he used to be. So he's wants to do it for approval, whereas I think it's a waste.

You see they aren't going to change, and you don't want to go through the cycle yet again where he gets his hopes up just to be hurt again. You know that, ultimately, the only way to stop the hurt/heal is for him to grow, face the truth of who they are, and make his own decisions/manage his expectations accordingly.\n\nBut, trust me, you do not want to be the one who forces him to see them as they are. He will in time, his own time, come to realize who they are and that they won't change. It is an incredibly painful truth to acknowledge though so look at his hope with as much compassion as you can muster and support and love him when they inevitably let him down again. You want to be a place of love, warmth and support. It's like when someone is in an abusive/toxic relationship--telling them to leave doesn't really work. Building up their self esteem, being a confidant, and reminding them that they deserve better treatment is more effective. \n\nThat being said, make sure you are aware of your own boundaries and your own feelings.

You don't have to help (though he would probably appreciate if you did).

Constant substance abuse is serious.  It takes its toll on the family suporting that person, the late night calls, the distressing conversations, the panic because someone is threatening to un alive themsleves.  At some point that family realises they can't help anymore and ends up shutting off because they can't put themself through that level of emotional turmoil incessantly.  It's too much.  They give up because they don't know what to do and they are at their wits end.\n\nYou experienced your husband at his worst very briefly did it very briefly before your husband got better - his family had been doing it for years and couldn't do it anymore. You have mainly experience\n\nNow you visit once a year, and they are still scared that the old version of your husband is going to show up.

And now so much time has passed that you are all basically strangers, there\\\\'s no much pain and history \n\nI ahve no idea if that could be what happened, or if his family are findamentally just assholes who caused all his issues in the first place.  But this is bigger than a fancy announcement.  If your husband wants to reconnect and rebuild bridges, and if his family weren't the cause of his issues in the first place, then you need to be supportive.

A calm discussion  more along the lines of \"Are you sure you want to be invested in this? Will you be OK if they do the same as before?\" would have at least shown love and care for his feelings.", "That's what he wants, and if it doesn't go as he hopes, he will have to rethink his relationship with them. He needs to see it for himself even if it may be hard afterwards, not just take your word for it.", "The asshole move isn\u2019t being willing or unwilling to do an announcement, it\u2019s how dismissive you were of your husband\u2019s feelings *after* he told you he wanted to try. Your \u201cwe can, but it won\u2019t make a difference\u201d approach is hurtful to him. YTA for shrugging off how your husband is feeling about reaching out to his family again.", "There\u2019s no prize for begrudging, dismissive agreement. Let\u2019s apply your rationale to another scenario: your future kid asks you to sign them up for sport camp because they dream of going pro. Unfortunately it\u2019s unlikely to happen. Would you still tell them \u201cfine I\u2019ll sign you up but it won\u2019t make a difference\u201d? Would you willingly and dismissively crush that kid like you are your husband? Is it likely he\u2019ll get this big healing moment from an announcement? Of course not. But what he didn\u2019t need is one more person being cruel. If he\u2019s really about making this announcement your role is comfort and support him when it doesn\u2019t go as he dreamed, and then discuss new boundaries. It\u2019s not pile the negativity on him from the very beginning.", "Nope.  Just nope.  There\u2019s a difference between a family at the end of their rope with destructive behavior and a family that openly disdains someone and does not care about them.  This family is the latter. I agree with what you are saying in principle but this is not that family. The few examples she gave makes that pretty clear. \n\nI agree with the comments people are making about making a special announcement being about letting the husband show his pride rather than it being for the benefit of this shitty family.   Is he also doing it for their approval?  Yes.  Will he be sorely disappointed? Sure. But he should be allowed his moment of pride.  Let him go out on a high note, because I bet this is what makes him give up on them.", "We are getting her version of events. There are three sides to every story.", "YTA. He wants to tell them his way and you're being completely dismissive. Grow up.", "NAH I think you were trying to protect him, which does not make you an AH, but if this is something he feels strongly about I think you should support him.\nIt sounds like his family is not someone who needs to be kept in your lives, but also that your husband needs a lot of therapy to work through all of that.", "YTA\n\nYou can't expect him to just dismiss them as you are. They're his family and even estranged, he's always going to want a certain amount of approval or respect from them ... Even if he'll never get it, if they aren't capable or willing.\n\nYou are fair to not want to spearhead the initiative, but understand that if he wants to, it's important to him, and your disparaging comments are hurtful. Let him do what he wants and don't actively be negative not bc they deserve it but bc he does.", "Congratulations on your pregnancy.  Let your husband announce the happy news to his family as he pleases.  HE  can make the special announcement and present it to his family on his terms.  Notice I said HE can make the announcement as HE pleases.  kt", "YTA and I say that lightly. As someone with estranged in laws who I don't generally care for, I let my SO take the reigns on anything that has to do with them. If he wants to do something he can do something. If they don't care it is what it is.", "yta just let him tell his family in the way that he wants. and grin and bear it. do it for him and no other reason is needed", "NTA\n\nYou're realistic. Being the black sheep is a lifelong job. They never let you forget. Your husband needs therapy, not turkey or an announcement. But make the announcement, then get him into therapy.", "I'm not going to say Y T A, but just do it.  Do it to support him. Plus, projects are fun bonding time!", "NAH, He can decide how to tell his parents.", "I don\u2019t want to say your are. You two need to sit down, potentially with a counselor, and have a serious discussion about how they treat your husband. This is so unhealthy and he\u2019s still trying to gain their approval and you see the tree in the forest.  \n\nHe needs to know he is a good person and he doesn\u2019t need their approval so they can\u2019t hurt him any longer.  They\u2019ve been cruel and maybe they will suddenly be happier for you both but maybe they\u2019ll start using the grandchild to manipulate him further. I think you subconsciously may be considering this but he hasn\u2019t even thought of it. \n\nYou also don\u2019t want his family to decide to suddenly be super involved and he says yes to everything so he can keep their approval. And then you end up in JustNoInLaw territory. \n\nTime to make conscious all these things weighing on you.", "YTA\n\nThis isn\u2019t about your in-laws.  This is about your husband.  HE wants to show his family he is the better person.  He wants to highlight the new addition to your lives.  \n\nMaybe his family aren\u2019t good people, in which case you and he can just stop even making any sort of effort, even for thanksgiving.  \n\nHe should be able to try, though.    \nMake a big announcement to them and see if they respond.  If they don\u2019t then move on.  If they do, then hopefully your relationship will improve.", "YTA. You basically told him that his family don't give a shit about him. That might be true but it's still not a nice thing to do.", "I think this is one of those \u201cmy family are garbage people but I can\u2019t let it go because I\u2019m technically family\u201d situations. I think OP doesn\u2019t want her husband to be disappointed again when they treat him the same. I think her husband is blinded by hope and family and OP sees clearly that these people are not going to be a part of their lives and not going to change. She\u2019s protecting her husband", "I agree. Let him call his family and let them know. You don't have to be a part of it", "Well maybe if OP knows that \"doing something to make her husband happy\" is actually going to hurt him more in the long run. I am not saying she should control or make decisions for him, but do you honestly think the announcement is what will make the husband happy rather than his family's approval? \n\nI don't really know myself, but from reading the post, OP seems self aware enough and close enough to the situation to know exactly how things will play out.\n\nTo be clear, I agree with the \"slight YTA\" still, I just think the tacked on \"why would doing something to make your husband happy be a waste of time?\" is kinda inappropriate.", "Absolutely. OP likely thinks she's saving him the heartache of them reacting badly or just not caring, but he needs to see it for himself. I recently had an experience seeing a parent after 15 years, who I'd believed to be a good parent and a good person, that crashed and burned. My heart broke and it super hurt BUT I had to see for myself. My husband had a pretty strong feeling it was going to go this way, and communicated that to me. However, he still funded and joined me on the trip and was supportive the entire time, including in the aftermath of a bit of devastation.\n\nOP, your best bet here is to be honest, optimistic, and supportive. \"I'm worried that because of their treatment of you and of us in the past, this isn't going to go well. They have a history of being hurtful. However I love you and support you, and we'll do everything we can to make this special and fun. I truly hope it goes well and we can all enjoy this exciting news together, but no matter how they respond please know I'm here for you. \"", "This.", "I have a question that might help explain his side. Why do you both continue to attend their Thanksgiving dinner? If he hasn't been willing to go no contact after years of being treated badly, his sense of self worth is still influenced by seeking their approval. This is a very complicated issue that likely needs some professional help if he is willing. I empathize fully you are trying to prevent him from being hurt, but Thanksgiving indicates to me he is ok with that, and that's the root issue that needs to be hacked away.", "You're completely dismissive of it. He says what he wants and instead of saying ok you counter with another dumb idea he doesn't want.", "This! Very well said.", "I get it. My in laws still see my husband as the delinquent he was 20 years ago (spent time in jail in his late teens for selling drugs). He is in NO WAY the same person, but they treat him like he is sometimes. That being said, it is about him and I know my husband really likes when we can show them how much he's grown. Even if it's a disappointment, it's still worth it in my mind for his sake. Slight YTA.", ">He says he's hurt that I'm so dismissive and maybe a special announcement will help them see he's not the man that he used to be.\n\nIs he in therapy? Because he needs to be.  He isn't going to get what he wants and he needs to not place that on your child.", "NAH. I get your reservations.  I sure hope your poor husband is getting therapy because he is the family scapegoat/emotional punching bag.  Ask your husband gently what he expects his family' reaction to be given they were not happy over the last pregnancy?  Given nothing has changed with their relationship how likely is it they will be supportive?  Then let him call them.  Be ready to support him after the call by reminding him of all the people who are happy for him and love him.", "YTA. It\u2019s his family, his choice. He is obviously seeking their approval.", "Very very soft YTA, it\u2019s for him- not for them. I say this as a person with *some* very, very awful in-laws (in how they are as people and how they treat him). \n\nPersonally, I would let him have control in planning but be eager to be involved and help.", "Go with your husband's wishes and needs in this, and be prepared to help him and blast his parents off forever if things go badly. Poor man.", "Soft YTA.  I understand you think that they are not worthy and I imagine there is protectiveness over both your husband and baby, but HE wants to tell them.  I really do feel for your husband - after everything, he still wants their approval and is expecting that this will change their view of him.  He may be let down again, but it sounds like he really wants to do this. And he has expressed that to you.  Support him in that. Especially because in some way, he may feel that your rejection of announcing to his family is a dismissal of not just his feelings, but him, as well.", "NTA. You don't own them anything.", "NAH\n\nI'm sad for your husband, even though it's not fair that he's transferring the responsibility his family owes him to you. You're trying to protect him and he's still looking for their praise and approval. \n\nNot sure how this can be fixed or if it can. I just hope he doesn't use you as a scapegoat somehow.", "NTA you know they are just going to hurt him and you want to save him from that but he wants it.", "YTA\n\nYou\u2019re not wrong but you need to take your cue from your husband being as it\u2019s his side of the family. Hopefully one day he\u2019ll decide he no longer wants to be their punching bag. Until then try to find ways to support him in his hope he clings to that they will change. They won\u2019t and you know this but it\u2019s not your call.\n\nOnce your child is around you will have grounds to put your food down more firmly bc they will damage your child with their toxicity and eventually the kid will grow up thinking this is just normal and okay (like your husband does).", "everyone here is babying your partner. He needs to understand reality. His family is crap and that\u2019s just the way that it is. NTA", "Hi there. I almost said y t a, but I'm gonna go with a very gentle ESH. \n\nSpeaking as the one who is estranged and no contact with her family, I had to get there myself. My spouse knew my family didn't value me and it hurt him to watch me seek their approval, but also trusted me enough to make my own decisions regarding them: they kept showing their asses and I stepped away. My spouse was really relieved and the decision has stuck because it is my own. \n\nI understand wanting to tell them via Facebook, especially because they were incredibly inappropriate with your last pregnancy (and I'm so sorry for your loss). Doing it this way gives them a chance to paint themselves as the victims by drawing false equivalencies. Maybe him making a phone call or a letter prior to making the public announcement would work. Let him take the reigns on planning it and be there for him if they react in the shitty way you anticipate.\n\nCongratulations, OP! I'm sorry you're having to deal with these logistics during such an exciting time which is meant to be about celebrating.", "Who wants to announce a pregnancy to people that said it was for the best you lost your first pregnancy? Honestly your husband is being really dismissive to how hurtful that was to you. NTA.", "Soft note, I think you missed the part where she knows exactly what will happen because they miscarried and the family was notified prior to that time when they were pregnant.\n\nI would not be down to frankly EVER have to interact with someone who thought it was okay to tell me my miscarriage was \u201cfor the best\u201d.\n\nAnd nobody could tel me different.", "I'm sorry, but as someone who has had 2 miscarriages; anyone who said \"it's for the best\" afterwards would be fucking dead to me.", "I think you\u2019re overlooking the completely toxic response these people had to the first pregnancy. In case you\u2019re male, a miscarriage is absolutely devastating. It\u2019s inconceivable a family member would tell the bereaved woman that the miscarriage was \u201cfor the best!!\u201d It implies that any child sired by their son would be defective. This is beyond insensitive, it\u2019s poisonous. I\u2019m in complete sympathy with her not wanting to be subjected to more of this hatefulness. As far as the husband goes, his pitiful desire to prove himself to these wads makes him vulnerable. I wish he wouldn\u2019t open his heart to them in this tender moment. They\u2019re most probably going to do a hell of a lot more than withhold approval. They\u2019re going to claw him to ribbons and I\u2019m sad for him.", "I agree with this. Very slight YTA. And this could be a really good opportunity for them to add the final straw to the camel and finally push your husband into seeing who they really are. Give them the chance to bury themselves so you can move on from the whole mess.", "Well said", "I'm with you on this one. It's best to follow his lead when it comes to his family, even if she wants to protect him. He can see for himself that they don't care, but he needs to be the one to cut that cord, not her, in this situation.", "She literally said that they could do it, she just didn't see the point. It's not like she said no way.", "He\u2019s an adult who gets to say when he needs or wants to be protected. \n\nI get that she means well (probably) but she\u2019s also being callous and dismissive of his feelings.", "The more comments you make, the more I say YTA. Are you really not getting the points that people are making here??", "Can we acknowledge that they already celebrated one miscarriage of hers and she\u2019s allowed not to care about announcing stuff to him? Ngl OP\u2019s partner seems like they care more about winning parents\u2019 approval than about the fact that they hurt her:", "How tf is she supposed to be supportive when these people literally told her that her miscarriage was \"for the best\"? Idk about you, but I'd never talk to *anyone* again who told me that.\n\nFuck being supportive."]}
