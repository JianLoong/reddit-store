We go on vacation with them every year, see them multiple times throughout the year and they actively check in on us. His family on the other hand is estranged. We see them all once a year (thanksgiving) and it's very awkward every single time. The only reason we are invited is because they want help with funding their feast. They don't like my husband and have been telling me to leave him and save myself since I got together with him (he was severely depressed at that time and had no goals- he's much different now but they still hold it against him years later). \n\nIt's important to note that we had become pregnant years ago and miscarried. None of his family was excited and when they found out we miscarried they said it was \"for the best\". So this time around I truly don't care if they know. I don't care to tell them. I don't like them as people and I certainly don't like how they treat my husband. To be quite frank, I could go my entire life keeping my unborn child from them people and sleep soundly at night. They shit talk my husband to everyone so I guarantee they will do the same to our kid. \n\nSo after we told my family my husband said something about \"now we have to figure out how to tell my family\" (because we did a special announcement to my family with lots of planning). I said \"how about a FB post\". He asked why my family got a special announcement but his doesn't and I said \"we can do a special announcement if you want but I don't see the point because they won't be excited and they will not care, just like the first time around.\" I wasn't trying to be dismissive about it but I guess I kind of am in the same sense because his family aren't good people. And as I said, we can make a special announcement for them but I truly think it's a waste of time and effort. He says he's hurt that I'm so dismissive and maybe a special announcement will help them see he's not the man that he used to be. So he's wants to do it for approval, whereas I think it's a waste.

You see they aren't going to change, and you don't want to go through the cycle yet again where he gets his hopes up just to be hurt again. You know that, ultimately, the only way to stop the hurt/heal is for him to grow, face the truth of who they are, and make his own decisions/manage his expectations accordingly.\n\nBut, trust me, you do not want to be the one who forces him to see them as they are. He will in time, his own time, come to realize who they are and that they won't change. It is an incredibly painful truth to acknowledge though so look at his hope with as much compassion as you can muster and support and love him when they inevitably let him down again. You want to be a place of love, warmth and support. It's like when someone is in an abusive/toxic relationship--telling them to leave doesn't really work. Building up their self esteem, being a confidant, and reminding them that they deserve better treatment is more effective. \n\nThat being said, make sure you are aware of your own boundaries and your own feelings.

You don't have to help (though he would probably appreciate if you did).

Constant substance abuse is serious.  It takes its toll on the family suporting that person, the late night calls, the distressing conversations, the panic because someone is threatening to un alive themsleves.  At some point that family realises they can't help anymore and ends up shutting off because they can't put themself through that level of emotional turmoil incessantly.  It's too much.  They give up because they don't know what to do and they are at their wits end.\n\nYou experienced your husband at his worst very briefly did it very briefly before your husband got better - his family had been doing it for years and couldn't do it anymore. You have mainly experience\n\nNow you visit once a year, and they are still scared that the old version of your husband is going to show up.

And now so much time has passed that you are all basically strangers, there\\\\'s no much pain and history \n\nI ahve no idea if that could be what happened, or if his family are findamentally just assholes who caused all his issues in the first place.  But this is bigger than a fancy announcement.  If your husband wants to reconnect and rebuild bridges, and if his family weren't the cause of his issues in the first place, then you need to be supportive.

I would go no contact with them, can you imagine all the horrid stuff they could say to your child?", "NTA \n\nanyone who says your miscarriage is \"for the best\" is someone you shouldn't ever have to speak to again.", "Do it for your husband and be there when they fail him again.", "NAH I can relate actually.. my husband has an estranged relationship with his dad and his dad's kids. It's awkward to see them too.. maybe once every couple years. They were really excited when I was pregnant with my first but it turned into them expecting to be in the baby's life which I'd have been fine with if it was important to my husband.. but it wasn't. So, they've met my son once and never reach out except every once in a while with an entitled \"when am I gonna see your kid\". Irritating cause they don't have a relationship with us . Why would they with my son?? This pregnancy, I've left it up to my husband but said I don't really want them to know since they feel entitled to our kids. \nI understand where you're coming from. Believe me. But I think this is ultimately up to your husband to decide. It's an announcement.. not a visit. When the kid is born.. THEN you have more of a say obviously.. as the mother, what kind of relationship the kid should have with his fam. If he wants to tell them though, he has that right.", "I don't think you're the AH, but I think prior experience hasn't taught him that they don't care about him, so it's not going to stop him from making the announcement showy.\n\nI don't know what would it need to be to prove that he cannot receive love or care from his toxic family, but maybe this event could be the final push to go NC.", ">None of his family was excited and when they found out we miscarried they said it was \"for the best\".\n\n\nAnybody who said this to my partner after a fucking miscarriage would be out of my life immediately. Op is NTA", "You experienced your husband at his worst very briefly did it very briefly before your husband got better - his family had been doing it for years and couldn't do it anymore.", "This should be top comment", "They\u2019re her feelings too. They literally told her their miscarriage was \u201cfor the best.\u201d If someone said that to me, I wouldn\u2019t want to ever talk to them about a pregnancy again.", "Maybe \"it was best not to bring a baby into that sort of dysfunction\" but do you REALLY have to say something like that to a woman who just had a miscarriage? Regardless of what you think, you can still offer your condolences politely and keep the rest of your thoughts to yourself.", "People say a lot of terrible things to people who miscarry. \"Your mom must really want grandkids now\" \"it's part of God's plan\" and \"it's not like it was a real baby\" we're just a few of the terrible things said to me. People don't know what to say, so they almost always say the wrong thing. Most of the time, at least in my experience, they're trying to find some sort of silver lining to make it a little bit better. They shouldn't have said it, but if people went around not speaking to anyone who said something insensitive after a miscarriage they wouldn't have anyone left to talk to.", "I say show up to Thanksgiving with the baby. That's all the announcement they need.", "NTA, I lost what respect I did have for your husband when he basically admitted that he is still chasing his family's approval.", "I\u2019m gonna have to go with a super soft YTA ? I get where you\u2019re coming from but I\u2019m also hearing your husband ? Seems like he might be hoping to reestablish a lifeline . You might disagree but it seems to be important to him? I\u2019d try to find a low key way to let him have this moment with his family .", "I think you should take the \"it's your family, do as you wish\" approach and not be overly involved yourself. I refuse to involve myself in my in-law drama beyond listening to my wife grumble about the current happenings. It's his family, if they want to be that way, that's between him and them.", "YTA", "You're right but wrong at the same time.\n\nHis parents might be AH but you have to tell your husband how you feel and let him decide how to break the news to his parents.\n\nYou're his wife and not his mother.", "Yta not for not wanting to tell them but disregarding how he feels. Dont treat him like his family does and dismiss him. Coming from you would bring these feelings up no doubt.", "YTA, even if it's coming from good intentions. My husband is currently in a similar situation with his family (parents constantly tall down to him/belittle his achievements, brother kicked up a stink about not getting a phone call about us expecting a kid but blew us off later when we told him we got engaged. The problem is that while you were dismissing your husband's family, you also dismissed his feelings and agency in the situation. It's important to him, despite whatever reality might bring. \n\nMy best advice is to apologize, help him with the announcement he wants to make, and if things go poorly just be there for him and remind him he deserves better. No \"I told you so\" or \"this is what I said would happen.\" People need time to mourn the relationships they thought they would have when family lets them down. Supporting him could help him realize that his effort is better spent on people who love him and return that effort. Where you two are at now, I wouldn't be stunned if he's just reading it as more of the \"you're not enough\" that he's getting from his family.", "Husband still has some low self esteem mixed in there. He wants to use the announcement to prove himself to his family. OP is TA for the harsh delivery, but she's right: her husband is setting himself up for heartbreak. I don't know if he's just always been the scapegoat or if he did something they won't stop punishing him for it, but his family are toxic and trying to win their approval will only harm him", "OP isn\u2019t being sensitive enough to his feelings and he\u2019s very clearly still emotionally invested in his family\u2019s approval. However he\u2019s not being sensitive to hers either. Telling someone who has miscarried it\u2019s \u201cfor the best\u201d deserves LC/NC. They need to address and work this it together because kids are a big responsibility and mutual collaboration is their big asset", "Exactly! I can\u2019t understand these comments. NTA.", "Oh I wish my MIL had just said it was \u2018for the best\u2019. She decided it was better to go around telling extended family I caused the miscarriage by exercising and I am the worst thing to happen to her son\u2026\u2026 I have put in a hard boundary that she is not allowed near me this pregnancy cause I don\u2019t trust her. I don\u2019t blame OP but if her husband wants to do something special him organise, pay and tell them but she should stay away from the whole thing imo not worth the added stress.", "Now if we can get \"it's\" and \"its.\"", "F that. She doesn\u2019t have to support this. She was traumatized and had people tell her it was for the best. Her husband should understand and do something for his own family. NTA", "That doesn't seem like the same situation. Her husband was extremely depressed and while yeah the family probably needs time to understand that he's changed, they were literally happy about op having a miscarriage.", "Dang, I'm flattered. Thanks!", "No side should say a miscarriage is for the best."]}
