If she is truly making eye contact every time that is a little sus. \n\nI do know if I clear my throat my husband does it too automatically because he already does it all day long. so I naturally trigger the response in him when I do it.", "Record her.

It could even be subconscious though.", "it genuinely sounds like an imitation response. could be many reasons. but if she was genuinely surprised, it could be very much unconscious.\n\nETA: I had a coworker with tourettes and he would do this.", "NAH in my opinion. I don't know her true intentions to be fair, but I can offer up a potential reason she might be doing this! So when I hear someone cough or wheeze, it makes my throat and chest feel super tight and I have to clear my throat or cough to fix it. Idk what causes this, I'm sure it's super annoying to anyone who catches it.", "Where I'm from, people do this with babies. If the baby is coughing, the parent clears their throat. I can't remember the reasong i was told but its something I grew up seeing as the norm...FOR BABIES! I used to think it was dumb as hell, but after having my son, I found myself subconsciously doing it. Never intentionally. Never purposely . And I sure as hell don't stare him down and do it. \n\nThat said. NTA. that's hella annoying. The fact that she looks at you and does it means she's doing it on purpose. Is she expecting you to say excuse me or sorry or something after you cough and clearing her throat is her way of asking you to?? Either way NTA", "You could have fun with this!\n\nWait until she's putting on mascara. Cough. \n\nGo outside with her and incidentally cough every two seconds, so that the two of you have this weird call-and-response thing going on in public.\n\nCough whenever she drinks.\n\nSee just how high you can ramp up the weird passive aggressive throat energy before one of you cracks.", "NTA. If it was only happening occasionally I'd give her the benefit of the doubt, but the fact she's doing it ***every*** time you cough and (based on your comments below) doing it in exactly the same volume/tone of your cough and staring at you while she does it suggests that it's deliberate, probably some weird power-play thing.\n\nYou've offered to go to another room and you've asked her politely about it, so there's nothing else you could have done. If she really is that bothered by it, ***she*** can go in the other room.", "NTA.  I would be annoyed as fuck.  Either she is doing it intentionally or she is having an involuntary response to your coughing.  Her turning it into a controlling issue is bizarre.

It doesn\u2019t seem like she\u2019s aware of it though if she\u2019s denying it so intensely.\n\nI have misophonia and tend to mimic sounds or visual stimulus that annoy me (subconsciously). I wonder if it\u2019s something like that. \n\nI know you offered to leave if it was annoying her but if it was me in her place I wouldn\u2019t want to make you feel bad so I would have pretended it didn\u2019t bother me even if it did.\n\nThere\u2019s nothing wrong with telling your partner if something is bothering you. So you telling her that the throat clearing thing was bothering you isn\u2019t bad.

So I totally get it.", "YTA\n\n\nIt's a natural reflex to YOU hacking up a lung.

I, too, suffer from seasonal allergies for like 9 months out of the year. Lol So I get it all! \n\nWhat  you need to do is start tossing in some sneezes, some snot swallowing type noises, different pitches of coughing, etc. Then, the icing on the cake...itching. Start subtly itching your neck every time you cough (or at least after any fits). If she starts doing that, then you got her! No way does she all of a sudden start to get an itchy neck coincidentally since you made that symptom up. Have fun with it! \n\nBut she is definitely mocking you.

Cough on purpose. Cough ten times in a row. Cough quietly, then normal, then loud. Then back to quiet. Then a few quick coughs, then a long pause, then a big one again. And just stare right back. See how far you can take it. \n\nDon\u2019t stop as long as she\u2019s clearing her  throat. She can tell you to quit it in between throat clears and you can just keep going. \n\nDon\u2019t think of it as her imitating you and she\u2019s lying about it. Realize that you\u2019re in control of her and she\u2019s unaware of it.\n\nThere is _no way_ this can go on for a full five minutes without her realizing that this isn\u2019t just random and she \u201chappens to be\u201d coughing immediately after you. The goal is make her realize she\u2019s being controlled by her reactivity and make it so obvious and uncomfortable that she\u2019ll have her freedom back. It\u2019s not about spite or revenge, it\u2019s about awareness. \n\nThis is a problem you can solve in less than five minutes (only 300 seconds!) if you just commit. Actually makes it easy as far as problems go.\n\nBy the way, if you splice an hour into 600 6-second windows and cough in 3 of those windows, the probability that she\u2019d choose those same 3 time windows at random to clear her throat is about 1 in 36 million. Sooo, not that likely.", "This is... an out there suggestion, and very anecdotal so I'd take with a major pinch of salt... and also probably a long comment so I apologise, but I have OCD, and what that actually looks like instead of organising your pens in parrallel lines (-or *can* look like, there are a few symptoms to it) is feeling the need to do 'rituals' (technical term) when the anxiety strikes because your helpful brain has you convinced that something terrible will happen to a loved one if you don't. The fun little sting in the tail is that with OCD the magical thinking of that isn't a true delusion, bc you *know* how irrational the thought is, you *know* how ridiculous you look to other people, but the story the disorder is telling you is so terrifying you feel like you can't risk it, or you can't make the thought go away any other way. It's really easy to feel deeply ashamed and embarrassed by how you're acting. One of my weird brain things with it is that if I am startled by something unexpectedly knocking into me, like my knuckles catching the edge of the door on the way past, I feel I need to knock them again in the same place and same way to make the right number set of knocks, or at least once again to 'undo' the initial knock so that nothing bad happens (I know that makes no sense at all - like I said, it's a fucking troll of a mental health problem). Often the person I get scared about things happening to is my partner, and I'll often stare at him whilst doing the 'ritual' either unconsciously or because my OCD has me feeling that needs to be part of it, depending on the arbitary rules it has decided on for any given month. Apparently I have spectacular RBF when I'm doing this, which doesn't surprise me bc obviously my brain's doing its theatrical runs of my worst fears. (Partner doesn't mind this, he knows what's going on. For the record I am working on all of this). Final thought is that misophonia is really commonly comorbid with OCD. One of my big triggers is the sound of people coughing.\n\nAnyway - the point is, I can totally see my brain twanging into deciding I needed to 'undo' any coughing noises I heard by repeating them to prevent something bad happening, and this is 110% what I would look like doing it, and I feel like it's entirely possible that someone would be too embarrassed to own up to the bizarre OCD narrative that passes for internal logic to these things and just stick with 'I just need to clear my throat'. \n\nLike I said, spectacularly long shot, 99.9% likely everything I wrote is completely irrelevent, just this comment sounded so strikingly similar to how my partner described experiencing my OCD behaviour earlier in our relationship when we'd first started talking about it.", "NTA. she sounds like she is playing games with you.
