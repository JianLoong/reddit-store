I have a two-seat car and can only take one passenger.\n\nToday she asks if her friend and travel buddy can get a ride to the airport too. GF comes up with a plan that involves me doing some car-swapping at the friend's house. GF would drive to friend's house. I would follow and park my car. I would then take friend's family's car to the airport and drop the two girls off, then returning to friend's house to drop off that car and finally retrieve my own little car.\n\nThe whole thing seemed complicated and I just wanted to take one person to the airport in my own car. It would be fine if I had a sedan so I could take the friend too. I don't want to drive a random car that's not mine, especially on the return route by myself. So I got a little upset at the change of plans, plus I had expressed I wanted to take my GF and only her to spend al little quality time, instead of 3rd-wheeling her friend.\n\nThe solution was for GF's mom to take them both. I wouldn't have to give rides. GF is upset that I made a big deal about the car-swapping idea and now I don't get to drop her off.

Your GF seems to be inconsiderate of how annoying this whole process can be, not to mention driving someone else's car can introduce its own set of issues. Say hypothetically you get into a car accident with her friends car, it's just gonna put a strain on everyone's relationships especially if it was somehow \"your fault\" for destroying the car. Just a bunch of headache I wouldn't want to deal with.", "NTA. You have valid reasons not wanting to drive someone else\u2019s car.", "NTA. She asked, you declined. Both are fine. \n\nYour GF is an AH for getting upset at your \u2018no\u2019 though.", "NTA. That\u2019s a PIA and eliminates any few minutes of quality time you were seeking.", "NTA. Quality time and not wanting to drive a strangers car are valid. Girlfriend was trying to be a fixer, also not a bad thing.", "NTA, I don\u2019t drive cars that aren\u2019t mine. Instead of being mad at me, call an Uber problem solved.", "NTA", "NTA - Asking you is fine. Refusing to do it is fine. Getting upset that you refused isn't fine.", "NAH - I can understand that they wanted to be efficient and carpool , as I have done that many times . I can also understand you\u2019re feeling uneasy at the thought of driving another persons car for a distance . But the other reasoning of wanting to be alone or that it was too complicated ( it was not , would have saved you gas money/mileage ultimately as well  ) then you would mildly be TA", "NAH \n\nFrom your perspective, it\u2019s super annoying when doing a nice thing for someone close to you turns into a whole convoluted job that takes up half your day and involves other people.  Driving strange cars around is also another layer of responsibility that you don\u2019t need, so I totally get why you didn\u2019t want to do this.\n\nI also don\u2019t think your GF really did anything wrong - she just wanted to help out a friend and it would have felt way more convenient to her for them to travel down together.  She probably wasn\u2019t being all that inconsiderate of your needs, just didn\u2019t quite understand how much of a burden the extra steps, plus the lack of one-on-one time, would place on you.\n\nIn the end, the solution of her mother taking both of them was a reasonable one, it\u2019s not ideal that your GF got upset with you when your response was reasonable enough, but I\u2019m sure you can get past that by calmly explaining your position on it, emphasising the point about wanting quality time with just the two of you.", "NAH I understand not wanting to drive a car you're not familiar with and that's not yours by yourself. Also understand why your gf thought it would be a good solution. I don't think anyone should make this into a big deal.", "NAH . Both you and your girlfriend have valid points", "NAH\n\nI understand that your gf wants to spend more time with you but in this case taxi'd be easier.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
