Your GF seems to be inconsiderate of how annoying this whole process can be, not to mention driving someone else's car can introduce its own set of issues. Say hypothetically you get into a car accident with her friends car, it's just gonna put a strain on everyone's relationships especially if it was somehow \"your fault\" for destroying the car. Just a bunch of headache I wouldn't want to deal with.", "NTA. You have valid reasons not wanting to drive someone else\u2019s car.", "NTA. She asked, you declined. Both are fine. \n\nYour GF is an AH for getting upset at your \u2018no\u2019 though.", "NTA. That\u2019s a PIA and eliminates any few minutes of quality time you were seeking.", "NTA. Quality time and not wanting to drive a strangers car are valid. Girlfriend was trying to be a fixer, also not a bad thing.", "NTA, I don\u2019t drive cars that aren\u2019t mine. Instead of being mad at me, call an Uber problem solved.", "NTA", "NTA - Asking you is fine. Refusing to do it is fine. Getting upset that you refused isn't fine.", "NAH - I can understand that they wanted to be efficient and carpool , as I have done that many times . I can also understand you\u2019re feeling uneasy at the thought of driving another persons car for a distance . But the other reasoning of wanting to be alone or that it was too complicated ( it was not , would have saved you gas money/mileage ultimately as well  ) then you would mildly be TA", "NAH \n\nFrom your perspective, it\u2019s super annoying when doing a nice thing for someone close to you turns into a whole convoluted job that takes up half your day and involves other people.  Driving strange cars around is also another layer of responsibility that you don\u2019t need, so I totally get why you didn\u2019t want to do this.\n\nI also don\u2019t think your GF really did anything wrong - she just wanted to help out a friend and it would have felt way more convenient to her for them to travel down together.  She probably wasn\u2019t being all that inconsiderate of your needs, just didn\u2019t quite understand how much of a burden the extra steps, plus the lack of one-on-one time, would place on you.\n\nIn the end, the solution of her mother taking both of them was a reasonable one, it\u2019s not ideal that your GF got upset with you when your response was reasonable enough, but I\u2019m sure you can get past that by calmly explaining your position on it, emphasising the point about wanting quality time with just the two of you.", "NAH I understand not wanting to drive a car you're not familiar with and that's not yours by yourself. Also understand why your gf thought it would be a good solution. I don't think anyone should make this into a big deal.", "NAH .

And this things requires extra time and money to do.", "NAH it's makes sense. To eb fair a car swapping plan is very customary in my family. I get that cars can feel different, but it shouldn't be that be a deal to drive another vehicle.", "Thanks, yeah I feel the same. If I had my old 4-door car I wouldn\u2019t hesitate to drive them both", "Why can\u2019t you take your GF and the friend gets a lift from her mom?", "NTA. This is unnecessarily complicated. Somehow now three cars are involved in an airport drop-off? \n\nGF is missing the whole point.", "Ah, OP, you aren't on their insurance therefore you CANNOT drive their car PERIOD.  End of story.\n\nYour GF and her friend and possible parents are idiots!!", "NAH.  SHe asked, you said no.  It sounds like she was looking to spend some extra time with you as well, so it makes sense that she, like you, was upset that it wouldn't happen.  No name calling or real arguments, so I'd say this is actually successful communication and respect for boundaries, even if you both aren't 100% thrilled with the outcome.  \n\nThis actually bodes well for your relationship.  Good job!", "**GF should have asked you before coming up with a grand plan with her friend.** \n\nNTA Your solution is practical.", "NTA. Probably your gf ego was hurt or maybe she boosted to her friend that \u201cmy bf will give us a ride\u201d and now you said no it hurt her ego. You did nothing wrong tho, she will be around with a cool head.. if she brings up the issue again just let her know how you felt and if she doesn\u2019t understand still her mistake.", "That's not how insurance works.", "NTA\n\nYou put yourself at risk by driving someone else\u2019s car. I guess it depends on how well you know this person and if you\u2019re comfortable with their vehicle. If you drive a smart car and they got a hummer you\u2019re probably not ok with this and that\u2019s natural and ok.\n\nThese people are not your responsibility.", "NTA they can get an Uber.", "Don't ever loan your car or borrow others.  Let her be mad.  Then you don't have to retrieve her.  Win Win.  GYOW", "NTA, driving some random friends car is not a good idea. If your girlfriend chooses not to have you drive her that\u2019s on her. It also shows she\u2019d rather be with her friend than around you\u2026 do with that information what you will.", "NTA.\n\nBut hang on a minute, isn't it illegal to drive someones car if you're not on their insurance policy? Is your GF Suggesting you commit *a Crime* for her benefit?", "YTA. It\u2019s inconvenient, but it\u2019s your girlfriend and her travel companion. Life\u2019s not always convenient.", "NTA people should never volunteer a task or favour that on behalf of someone else.  It's so rude.", "NTA - driving someone else's car has its own  set of problems. We're creatures of habit and our personal cars are usually tailored to how we want it while driving. \n\nDriving someone else's car usually requires the driver getting comfortable, figuring out where everything is, and adjusting all the mirrors and seats, so that their driving won't be impacted.\n\nA completely unnecessary hassle, especially when the person offering to drive is only doing it as a favour", "NTA. But people are so weird about rides to airports. The passengers are never concerned about the driviers. It is an inconvience to the driver no matter how many people they are driving. They should get a service", "NTA Your GF could go pick up her friend, and bring her back to your place so you didn\u2019t have to make an extra trip. Their suggestion is silly", "NTA dude.\nIt's not advisable to drive someone else's car if you're in the States. Insurance doesn't apply AFAIK. And well, you did express to your gf that you wanted alone time. Does she usually bulldoze your suggestions and get you to go along with what she wants, practicality be damned?", "NTA. You offered to be nice and spend time together and she took advantage of that in the worst way possible", "NTA lots of reasons to not want to drive someone else\u2019s car.", "NTA, your gf was inconsiderate of you and made a whole new plan without ever consulting you from what you've told us. If I made a plan for my fianc\u00e9 to drive me somewhere I'm meeting a friend and that friend asked me to have him go out of his way, I'd ask him directly. If he says no, it's no. I wouldn't expect him to accommodate my friend, especially if it was a plan with a vehicle involved that neither of us personally own (so many problems with that by itself). You're not wrong to not want to change the plans she discussed with you, and if your gf wanted to ride with you, she should've stuck to the plan you agreed to, not tried to make new ones.", "NTA!! Check laws, found out when my sibling wrecked my dad's truck that even though the truck was insured and my brother had insurance but wasn't on the truck it caused a huge hassle when making the claims because technically my brother wasn't a listed driver for the truck", "How far is the airport? How far is her friends house? And why not drive the Girlfriend\u2019s car? Why can\u2019t the friend meet at your place if driving GF\u2019s car?", "NTA- it\u2019s stressful to drive a new car and the insurance arrangements are also unvlesr", "NTA.  That sounds like a lot of work just to take them to the airport.  There's no reason her friend couldn't gotten her own ride & met you there, swapping cars, especially a car you've never driven owned by people I assume you don't really know.  That can be awkward.  Your gf was being inconsiderate of your time & the annoyance of this.", "YTA.  You sound like a pain in the ass.  What\u2019s the big deal of driving a strange car?  It\u2019s a car, so long as it is in good repair no issue there.  Quality time?  Quality time doesn\u2019t have to be one on one, you create memories together even if others are around.  Now you get no time and an unhappy GF.  Bad job, bro.", "Actually did you tell her this? It seems like she was trying to find a solution to get to the airport not spend time with you.. so you didn't express yourself about the time you wanted while she was just trying to make logistics easy...youre a dick \n\nI used to date a dude like you... so glad hes still single and learning effective communication because he's an 'I' guy like you...last I heard he's gotten way better at keeping himself from getting worked up over his feelings and learning to assess the entire situation and manage it accordingly because it's not always about you", "Soft YTA. Your GF offered a perfectly reasonable solution, you didn\u2019t communicate you wanted alone time.", "NTA. So many of these situations boil down to people not understanding a basic premise:\n\nYou can ask somebody to do you a favor;\nYou can tell somebody how you want them to do something they're already obliged to do;\nYou can't do both. \n\nIt's either a favor (in which case you accept it on the terms provided or do it yourself), or it's an obligation.", "NTA. Your GF and her carbon footprint are though!", "Not to mention if he\u2019s not on the car owner\u2019s insurance and gets into an accident then everyone is gonna be in a whole lotta trouble.", "I doubt the friend is a stranger. It\u2019s just a unfamiliar vehicle.", "Right?!?!", "Completely wrong.", "My insurance covers if I am driving someone else's car. I thought this was common", "It's not illegal no. (In some places obviously I don't know where OP is located)", "My instinctive reaction whenever I see an airport ride thread here is \u201cWhy didn\u2019t they book an Uber?\u201d and I will specifically ask OP if they fail to say so. The only acceptable answer in my book is \u201crural area\u201d.", "Quit putting words in people\u2019s mouths", "I wouldn\u2019t want to drive someone\u2019s car that was not a part of my immediate family. \n\nOP has no idea what kind of insurance coverage they have and if something happened then OP would be held liable.\n\nMy insurance, for instance, only covers accidents if I\u2019m the driver.", "I\u2019m some places yes it is. My insurance covers my vehicle only when operated by listed drivers. If I let a random person drive my car and they wreck, my insurance pays nothing.", "The commentor above made it clear this is an absolute no, it cannot be done, which is clearly wrong. \n\nObviously some insurers might not allow it"]}
