I had to add my son to mine when he moved out so he was covered using our truck from time to time.", "Yeah. Another commenter suggested I could go to GFs place and use her car to drive both of them, then return the car and take my own car home. Still more complicated than just her mom driving them", "If you read the post it says that it's the friends families car. It is not owned by the friend, it is owned by their family. Whilst I can understand being familiar with the GFs friend it's very unlikely that he has any, let alone a close, relationship with her family. Not to mention, as countless others have, the legal and personal ramifications if he's not insured properly. Depending on the country he is in he could face a court appearance or lose his licence simply for driving uninsured and the car could be seized. In fact if he's in the UK the car would 100% be seized if he was found to be driving it uninsured meaning he would be stranded. This is all without even thinking about what could happen if he got into an accident. I can appreciate I'm not talking to a smart person here (\"sometimes you got a man up and do shit you don't want to do\") but surely even someone like you can see that this isn't about it being inconvenient and him being \"whiny\"?", "If I\u2019m reading correctly, the plan was not for OP to drive the travel companion\u2019s car but rather the travel companion\u2019s family member\u2019s car. It\u2019s not clear if OP has even met the owner of the car, or if the owner of the car was okay with this plan.", "It\u2019s not the travelling companions car, it\u2019s one of their family members cars. They are likely to be a stranger to OP. L2R.", "OP got upset about the change of plans, not about whether he was driving his GF to the airport, or not. That is what is said in the post. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t him that changed the plan. He doesn\u2019t have to feel guilty/sad about his decision not to drive the two to the airport", "I get you want to make this as easy as possible and you might not want to take the friend at all, but for your relationship it would help to compromise. If everyone could meet at gf's parents' house, you drive gf's car, then drop the keys with her parents and take your car home, that doesn't seem so bad?", "The dreaded airport run is already a huge ask.", "Click on the profile, from the us, the  uk argument is invalid. I have insurance that covers me no matter who\u2019s car I\u2019m driving. Your whole comment is a waste of time because you don\u2019t know anything about his personal situation. Do some research before opening your rathole", "I never mentioned anything about who owns the car. I said it was an unfamiliar car. Personally I would drive them to the airport, any one who\u2019s ever traveled by plane knows the power and convenience of a ride to the airport and spending that last little bit of time with loved ones is priceless.", "\"And now I don't *get* to drop her off\" implies that he wanted to drive her, and he straight up said he wanted to spend time with her.\n\nLike, yes, I agree, he doesn't need to be disappointed he doesn't get to drive her, but that doesn't change the fact that he is, indeed, disappointed.", "Yeah this is a viable option now that you outline it and would be fairly low effort on my part. Didn't think of it in the moment.", "Yeah you did, you said it was unlikely to be a strangers car (whilst assuming it belonged to the travelling companion) are you really this forgetful?", "NAH  GF asked for a favor which is perfectly fine.  BF declined, also fine.  Friend's mom is taking them, problem solved.  GF is disappointed BF declined the favor and now her BF can't drop her off.  OP sounds like he's disappointed that he doesn't get to drop her off.  Sometimes people get disappointed it's part of adulting.", "When did \u201cI do you a straightforward favor\u201d become \u201ci have to follow your rube-goldberg plan?\u201d\n\nNTA", "I got a headache just trying to picture the whole car swapping thing.\n\nNOPE NOPE AND NOPE.  If she wants a ride from you then she can deal with it being a two seater(2 person) situation.  Otherwise she can't complain.\n\nNTA", "In the comments, you stated the airport was 10 minutes away, and her friend lived a few blocks away from you. It sounds like everyone made this way more complicated than it needed to be. \n\nNTA, but also sometimes compromise is important in a relationship. Regardless, I\u2019m glad your girlfriend got to go to the airport with her travel buddy, and you didn\u2019t have to worry about driving a car that wasn\u2019t yours for two 10 minute trips\u2026", "If your GF and her friend are traveling together, then it makes sense for them to coordinate travel plans, which includes a ride to the airport. \n\nIn this situation, if you wanted to help your girlfriend, that means helping her friend too. She came up with a way you could do that. You were too stubborn to take it. \n\nSo they found other arrangements that don\u2019t needlessly complicate *their plans for traveling together*.\n\nNow you\u2019re salty that you don\u2019t \u201cget\u201d to drive your girlfriend to the airport. \n\nI\u2019m going against the grain here and saying YTA for complaining that you don\u2019t \u201cget\u201d to drive your girlfriend to the airport. You 100% could have\u2026 you were just too stubborn to help in the way she needed help. \n\nYou complain that the whole thing seems too complicated for you, but you clearly don\u2019t care that you were making her travel plans more complicated by trying to split up the people who are actually traveling together. \n\nIf you want to help your girlfriend, then help her. But insisting on doing things your way that aren\u2019t what she needs does not help. It just complicates things.", "I\u2019m not understanding this scenario; \nGF is going to drive HER car to friend\u2019s house & leave it there? You said you were going to follow in your car\u2026 what is wrong with GF\u2019s car that you can\u2019t leave your car at home & just drive that to the airport & back, picking up her friend on the way there? \n\nNTA bc the plan sounds super confusing and not worth the headache.", "Absolutely NTA.  Let's boil this down.  You offered to do Job A.  Girlfriend rejected that and told you to do Job B instead.  Which isn't even close to the same amount of effort as Job A. \n\nLet's say you said, \"This weekend I'll report that plant for you.\"  And Girlfriend said, \"No, you're going to be planting a whole new garden.\"  While the end result is similar (plants get planted) the steps from beginning to end are wholly different and taken significantly different amounts of time and mental effort.  They're not even close to the same thing.", "\u2018\nNTA", "NTA, but why couldn\u2019t you just drive your GF\u2019s car?", "NTA\n\nI find it really rude that she made a whole plan with her friend before she even asked you. I'm fine driving people I know, but once I put other people in my car I freak out. I was in a bad car accident when I first got my license so driving makes me really nervous.\n\nIt is fine to ask if you would be comfortable doing this, but she never should have made plans with her friends before asking you. And when you said no, asking her mom to take them seems like a good backup plan", "NTA. I just had to get a new car two days ago and I\u2019m STILL not comfortable driving alone after 50 miles under my belt. With insurance and the way people drive anymore, it\u2019d be an immediate no from me too.\n\nETA I\u2019m 37 with decades of driving experience in all weather", "OP is also upset that he doesn\u2019t \u201cget\u201d to drive his girlfriend to the airport, even though he refuses to help in the way she needs help. He complains her solution was too complicated, but shows no realization that he\u2019s complicating things for the people actually traveling together. \n\nIf he was fine with his GF getting a ride from her mother, then I\u2019d say n t a, but the fact that he\u2019s complaining about it makes him TA in my mind.", "GF did come up with a grand plan to get her and her friend to the airport. \n\nOP is salty because it doesn\u2019t include him anymore, after he\u2019s refused to help in the way she needs help.\n\nShe compromised; he didn\u2019t.", "They did, of sorts. Her mom is driving now. \n\nOP is still unhappy about that. \n\nSeems like that makes him TA.", "Doesn\u2019t carpooling like the GF wants save on emissions?\n\nOP\u2019s plan is the one that would require more driving overall.", "They did- her mom is driving them now. \n\nOP is still salty about that because he doesn\u2019t \u201cget\u201d to drive her, and leave her travel companion without a ride\u2026", "You might have one of those bargain basement policies. Most policies cover the occasional driver.", "All these people are entitled and have full extended coverage and can't imagine someone having basic coverage", "You hit the nail on the head here. \n\nYou complain about her plan being too complicated, while showing no recognition that them not traveling to the airport together complicates things for them. \n\nIf you wanted to help your girlfriend, you needed to help her in the way she needs help. Trying to force her to leave her friend without a ride when they\u2019re traveling together is the opposite of helping. I doubt that she\u2019s impressed you were so stubborn here.", "Hmmm. Well, that's reasonable for her to say. It's also ok for you to feel miffed. It sounds like what you really need is to spend quality time with her. \n\nPro tip from a professional coach: ask yourself \"How can I satisfy this positive intention of wanting quality time outside of this drive?\"\n\nIt's ok to feel miffed, and this is a small incident \u2013 not something I'd allow to create resentment. Process your feelings, release them, and discuss another way you both can have your quality time!", "This was over a 10 minute ride??\n\nWow dude, despite everyone telling you NTA here, it really sounds like you blew this big time by being so stubborn.", "OP said the plan involving 3 cars was hers. He only wanted to take one person.", "Isn't liability usually put on the owner of the car not the driver?

This you?", "You should be more concerned with being brainwashed by incel ideology", "What is incel ideology?", "I'd call it a mouth? Have you been putting rats in yours? That's not what your supposed to do man.", "Well I think it probably got cluttered with your gf's plan (which was a silly plan lol). Sometimes things are clearer when you're not directly involved. \n\nRegardless of what you decide to do, I hope you two can work through this problem."]}
