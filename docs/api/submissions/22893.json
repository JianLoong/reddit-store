It's her responsibility to provide for him. If she wants expensive things for her growing child, that's her choice, but she's the one who has to pay for those items.\n\nYou don't have to continue being an unpaid babysitter. Tell her, don't ask, that she owes you some funds for groceries and incidentals that you've paid for over these weeks that you've been doing childcare for her. \n\nNTA for saying no, and you would be a fool to continue to financially support her child when you have two children and your own future to provide for. Make it clear to yourself where your priorities lie.", "You need to learn what a boundary is, set one, and start enforcing it. She chose to have a child, you didn't choose to finance her child.\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nYour sister is never going to change. You have to be the one to set the boundaries you both need. Your children take priority for you, and always will. You cannot afford to pay for her son anymore. There will be no more free babysitting, period. Don't think about it as letting your sister or your nephew down: think about it as finally putting your own children first. They need you, and your sister is stealing your time and resources from them.\n\nWhen your sister throws a colossal tantrum - and she will - put her in a six month time out. It will give you a much needed mental break, and show her that there are consequences for her terrible behaviour. And in six months, you can reevaluate if she is someone that should even be in your life. If she is, then you can state your boundaries, and try to build a new relationship that works for both of you.", "NTA. So there\u2019s brothers and your parents? Do they feel bad for not helping? Best you tell your sister to ask them! And you\u2019ve had her kid the entire summer?!?! She really does have you wrapped around her little finger if you don\u2019t want this to continue you\u2019re going to have to say something.", "NTA, but look. If you lie down in front of them, people will walk all over you. So stop paying for your nephew, stop being a ATMs and free babysitter. Set boundaries. Don't fall for the 'But... Family' - argument, because what are you? The wicked stepmother? You're family too and you deserve support as well.", "No, you wont be an a-hole. \nTry to see thing from another prospective: if your roles were reversed can you tell for sure that your sister would have done the same for you?\nBecause from what I've seen she using the 'pity party card' to feel entitled to ask for everything and having you indulge her every whim. Are you really ok with her mooching off you for the rest of your life?\n\nEven if being a single mom was a choice for you, your two children have only you to rely on 100%.\nNow you are in a good financial position, but who knows what future can bring.\nIf I had kids and money to spare, they would be my top priority. Also saving money for emergency funds, trust/college funds and any other things I could think of, to be sure that If something ever happens to me, I know that I have left my children with what they need to have a good start in life.\n\nSo, stop being a sister for once and be a mother first.\nGood luck OP!", "NTA, not your kid not your problem. It's not your job to pay for your nephew, thats his MOMS job, it's your job to take care of YOUR kids.

My sister made a lot more so I knew I could ask her for help if the kids needed extras. I never expected or wanted her to buy everyday things for my boys.

Your brother is right! You do spoil your sister and need to put your foot down.\n\nYour a single mom you are taking what precious money you have for your kids and giving it to your sister. She is guilting and manipulating you to the point that she thinks it\u2019s ok to leave her kid the whole summer with you and demand you buy his things.\n\nStop letting her use you. You have to prioritize your own kids. \n\nStart putting your foot down. Your nephews situation is better than your own kids.

Pay for all his school lunches? Pay for his field trips? Pay for his college/university tuition? Pay for his wedding? You said you signed up to be a single mom but did you sign up to be a single mom of 3?\n\nIf you feel bad then just think of it this way. Everything you have to divert to her son is taking from your own children. Is it fair to your children for you to do this? Raising a child is no small cost. Everything you save up could be put forward into your children's future tuition, wedding, car, etc. Things to help your own children have a better life.\n\nUnless her son is completely neglected and abused without your help you are not obligated to help.", "NTA. That\u2019s not your child. She can pay his way, one way or the other. Many people do not intend to be single parents, myself included.

To be able to hang out with their friends without him hanging around.  \n\nSomething else to keep in mind is that as your children progress through school things get more expensive, there are more fees and extra curriculas, dances, school trips etc.  How will you feel if you can\u2019t afford some of this for your children because you spent so much on your nephew?\n\nYou are also a single parent, you don\u2019t say if dad is around but even if he is your sister saying her child has to be the favorite because he only has 1 parent is obnoxious.

I love my nephew dearly but he\u2019s very spoiled and can be difficult to handle. My sister is one of those parents who thinks her kid needs the nicest clothes and shoes money can buy.

What does your sister expect for you to ignore your own kids in favor of hers and put yourself in a worse situation?", "I completely agree with the NTA, but the nephew's dad died when he was just a baby. From the she didn't plan it comment, I assumed that sister and partner together wanted the baby when he died. If that's the case, all of the things you suggested would be off the table other than adoption after dad died.

For goodness sake what are you doing? Grow a backbone and tell her no. Why has your nephew been with you all summer instead of with his mother????\n\nSorry if im sounding harsh, but as a single mother, providing for and caring my child is my responsibility. She is taking you for a ride.", "Right come on now this is just silly. Tell her NO. She can furnish her child in whatever her heart desires, with her own money. She sounds very ungenerous towards your kids too.", "Girl, do you hear yourself? There's a difference between want and need. Does the kid need  shoes? Yes. Does he need the BEST shoes money can buy? No, that's a want. \n\nMy parents used to say 'I want doesn't get'. That's what you need to tell your sister. \n\nHis needs are her responsibility. She may WANT more money for expensive things, but tough shit. I want to kayak through the Norwegian fjords. We all have to live within our means.", "She's taking the piss and you know it.", "Very true and good to point that out."]}
