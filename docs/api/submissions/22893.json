It's her responsibility to provide for him. If she wants expensive things for her growing child, that's her choice, but she's the one who has to pay for those items.\n\nYou don't have to continue being an unpaid babysitter. Tell her, don't ask, that she owes you some funds for groceries and incidentals that you've paid for over these weeks that you've been doing childcare for her. \n\nNTA for saying no, and you would a fool to continue to financially support her child when you have two children and your own future to provide for. Make it clear to yourself where your priorities lie.", "You need to learn what a boundary is, set one, and start enforcing it. She chose to have a child, you didn't choose to finance her child.\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nYour sister is never going to change. You have to be the one to set the boundaries you both need. Your children take priority for you, and always will. You cannot afford to pay for her son anymore. There will be no more free babysitting, period. Don't think about it as letting your sister or your nephew down: think about it as finally putting your own children first. They need you, and your sister is stealing your time and resources from them.\n\nWhen your sister throws a colossal tantrum - and she will - put her in a six month time out. It will give you a much needed mental break, and show her that there are consequences for her terrible behaviour. And in six months, you can reevaluate if she is someone that should even be in your life. If she is, then you can state your boundaries, and try to build a new relationship that works for both of you.", "NTA. So there\u2019s brothers and your parents? Do they feel bad for not helping? Best you tell your sister to ask them! And you\u2019ve had her kid the entire summer?!?! She really does have you wrapped around her little finger if you don\u2019t want this to continue you\u2019re going to have to say something.", "NTA, but look. If you lie down in front of them, people will walk all over you. So stop paying for your nephew, stop being a ATMs and free babysitter. Set boundaries. Don't fall for the 'But... Family' - argument, because what are you? The wicked stepmother? You're family too and you deserve support as well.", "No, you wont be an a-hole. \nTry to see thing from another prospective: if your roles were reversed can you tell for sure that your sister would have done the same for you?\nBecause from what I've seen she using the 'pity party card' to feel entitled to ask for everything and having you indulge her every whim. Are you really ok with her mooching off you for the rest of your life?\n\nEven if being a single mom was a choice for you, your two children have only you to rely on 100%.\nNow you are in a good financial position, but who knows what future can bring.\nIf I had kids and money to spare, they would be my top priority. Also saving money for emergency funds, trust/college funds and any other things I could think of, to be sure that If something ever happens to me, I know that I have left my children with what they need to have a good start in life.\n\nSo, stop being a sister for once and be a mother first.\nGood luck OP!", "NTA, not your kid not your problem. It's not your job to pay for your nephew, thats his MOMS job, it's your job to take care of YOUR kids. If your sister is hard up for stuff for school there are plenty of programs that help parents get supplies for their kids", "Why do you feel obligated to carry someone else's financial burden?", "Put your foot down. My sister made a lot more so I knew I could ask her for help if the kids needed extras. I never expected or wanted her to buy everyday things for my boys.  My job as mom is to get everything that that they need. If I can't do it I can ask for help. No one owes me help so I should never expect it. Your sister needs to grow up.", "Stop enabling her , she obviously is taking advantage of you and your good nature, your brothers are right.", "She didn\u2019t choose to be a mother but she needs to grow up and accept the responsibility of having a son. It\u2019s nice of you to help her out but you\u2019ve done enough and she has to support her son herself.", "You are not obligated to help. NTA. You said it yourself, she\u2019s manipulated you into a second parent role which you did not sign up for, the same way she did not sign up to be a single mom. There will be no end to this if you let her get away with it", "NTA- There are many groups that do back to school rallies that gives out schools supplies and uniforms.", "NTA", "YWBTA if you did not put your foot down. Your brothers are right.", "NTA. You have 2 kids that you need to provide for too. Seems like your sister knows how to take advantage of you. I agree with your brothers that you need to put your foot down!!", "NTA. He's not your son, he's your nephew. You can help if you choose, but you can also choose not to. If you keep going at this rate, she's going to expect you to put him through university when the time comes. Listen to your brothers in this. They might be more objective than you.", "NTA! Your brother is right! You do spoil your sister and need to put your foot down.\n\nYour a single mom you are taking what precious money you have for your kids and giving it to your sister. She is guilting and manipulating you to the point that she thinks it\u2019s ok to leave her kid the whole summer with you and demand you buy his things.\n\nStop letting her use you. You have to prioritize your own kids. \n\nStart putting your foot down. Your nephews situation is better than your own kids. Your sister has your parents helping where you have none. \n\nYour kids are your only responsibility! Stop prioritizing your nephew!\n\nYour sister is entitled and spoiled! Stop letting her use you!", "Nta. Do what YOU feel. If you want to get him stuff, get him stuff. If not, dont. Thats the fun of being am aunt and not the parent. Info - does she not get social security for her child for the  deceased dad?", "NTA \ud83d\udcaf", "YWNBTA\n\nYou are not obligated to help someone else raise their child and your brothers are right. If you keep letting her do this to you and she won't even reciprocate a little of your generosity she's just going to keep stepping on you. Now it's back to school supplies what's next? Pay for all his school lunches? Pay for his field trips? Pay for his college/university tuition? Pay for his wedding? You said you signed up to be a single mom but did you sign up to be a single mom of 3?\n\nIf you feel bad then just think of it this way. Everything you have to divert to her son is taking from your own children. Is it fair to your children for you to do this? Raising a child is no small cost. Everything you save up could be put forward into your children's future tuition, wedding, car, etc. Things to help your own children have a better life.\n\nUnless her son is completely neglected and abused without your help you are not obligated to help.", "NTA. That\u2019s not your child. She can pay his way, one way or the other. Many people do not intend to be single parents, myself included. We don\u2019t expect others to foot the bill for our choices, either. She needs to parent her own child. She needs to provide for her own.", "You have to look after yourself and your kids. Time to set some boundaries. I think it\u2019s tragic that your nephew lost his father but your sister really needs to step up and figure things out instead of laying that parental burden on you. You\u2019re NTA in putting your foot down.", "Nta. Your brothers are right", "You are NTA for putting the needs of your children and their future first.", "NTA - your brothers are right. No she didn't plan on being a single mom - but she should have.", "NTA\n\nTime to enforce some new boundaries here.", "NTA, you have no obligation and your sister is using you.  Time to tell her now and stick to it", "NTA. Your sister is taking advantage of you. While it's understandable that she needed some help to get back on her feet after her partner died, that aid should be fair, balanced, temporary and given voluntarily.", "Wtf? \n\nSo you have to SUPPORT her child while she says \u201cfuck\u201d yours? Stop being a doormat and grow a spine!", "No, you are not the AH.  You are not obligated to help.  You are a single parent who works to provide for your children, your sister can too.", "NTA.  Helping is voluntary and should be done when you want, and are able. Sister sounds pretty entitled tbh.", "NTA Suggest she ask mom and dad as you are broke, especially after funding nephew all summer. Grow a spine, you are at risk of enabling her even more than you have already.", "You don't have to set yourself on fire to keep your sister warm. It's a tragedy that your nephew is without a dad, but you too have your own family to look after.\n\nNTA", "NTA, you've babysat for the summer for free. It's not exactly free, you've provided food and probably activities too. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou have 2 children of your own to care for, your sister doesn't need your help, she needs to learn how to manage on her own. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContinually helping her isn't going to get her to learn how to manage on her own so let it go!!", "You need to step up and buy your nephew's school supplies.  And new bike.  And wardrobe.  And first car.  And ivy-league college education.  And starter home.\n\nIn case it escaped your attention, those all things that a **parent** does for **their** children, not the responsibility of an aunt.  If you don't break this cycle, eventually your sister will be coming to you for all these things.  Listen to your brothers, they know the exact circumstances of your situation.  \n\nNTA for standing your ground", "You've got your children to provide for first. She has her child she needs to provide for first. I hope you can set this boundary. Otherwise, it will never end. NTA", "NTA last time I checked she had the kid, not you", "NTA\nIt\u2019s time to tell your sister NO, I will not be buying nephew anything for school.  No explanation required. \n\nHow do you children feel about having your hard to handle nephew around all the time?\nI bet they would love some time without him during their summer vacation.  To be able to hang out with their friends without him hanging around.  \n\nSomething else to keep in mind is that as your children progress through school things get more expensive, there are more fees and extra curriculas, dances, school trips etc.  How will you feel if you can\u2019t afford some of this for your children because you spent so much on your nephew?\n\nYou are also a single parent, you don\u2019t say if dad is around but even if he is your sister saying her child has to be the favorite because he only has 1 parent is obnoxious. Your sister is very entitled. \n\nStop enabling her bad behavior, tell her no and give your kids a few weeks cousin free before school starts.", "I should\u2019ve included in my post that my sister often insists that her son has to be our parents\u2019 favorite grandchild because he only has one parent. I love my nephew dearly but he\u2019s very spoiled and can be difficult to handle. My sister is one of those parents who thinks her kid needs the nicest clothes and shoes money can buy. So, she\u2019s asking me to buy pairs of expensive shoes for him to wear to school.", "NTA. You\u2019re not obligated to your sister or your nephew. I do kind things for my nieces and nephews because I and my wife want to. If anyone tried forcing or guilting us into it we\u2019d just ignore them. We never blame the kids though and still get them something. Don\u2019t feel bad for having boundaries. What does your sister expect for you to ignore your own kids in favor of hers and put yourself in a worse situation?", "I completely agree with the NTA, but the nephew's dad died when he was just a baby. From the she didn't plan it comment, I assumed that sister and partner together wanted the baby when he died. If that's the case, all of the things you suggested would be off the table other than adoption after dad died. That doesn't give her an excuse for how she's acting and treating OP, but it isn't fair to blame her being a single mom on those other things when she was a single mom because her partner died.", "One of our brothers lives on the other side of the country and doesn\u2019t come often. The other has two kids of his own.  My parents think that because my kids are older and I\u2019m doing better financially, I don\u2019t need any help. My sister gets all the assistance.", "It\u2019s like I feel obligated to help her. I guess it\u2019s my protective older sister instinct.", "Hell no nip that in the bud now! Tell your parents favortism between the grandkids will no longer be tolerated! If they continue then do not allow them access to your kids!\n\nHonestly you should have stopped this years ago.  Your allowing an unruly 5 year old to disrupt your children\u2019s life. Take time and energy from the only parent they have at home. By doing this your being a bad parent to your own children. They deserve to have you attention 100 percent of the time! They will resent you if you keep allowing this to happen!", "NTA . It\u2019s not your job to provide for your nephew ( unless you want to ) and if you choose to take him in in future don\u2019t do it unless she provides the funds to his upkeep", "If in US your sister should be getting money from SS until the child is an adult. She can use that and her own income to pay for her kid. You are not the baby daddy you have no financial responsibility to him.", "Hell no! No kids need that. That's one of the dumbest ways to spend money on a 5 year old.", "Then your parents can assist her with summer care.", "Unfortunately the amount you have spent looking after your nephew all summer has left you unable to help. In fact, you are struggling to equip your own children and would appreciate it if she could reimburse you for some of the summer's expenses.", "Your protective momma bear instincts need to kick in and realize your harming your children by allowing this."]}
