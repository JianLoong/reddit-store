How will they ever recover from this devastating blow?\n\nPeople get weird deals with coupons and buying whole pallets of mystery stuff. There\u2019s literally stores that exist because they bought boxes of returned / overstocked items. Just because it\u2019s cheaper than retain doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s stolen.", "NTA\n\nYour friend is weird. She is assuming it is stolen. That doesn't mean it is. Even if it was stolen you would not be the AH. Your friend\u2019s allegiance to big box stores is off-putting.", "NTA. Your friend has fallen for retail propaganda designed to set her against others of her class. If she wants to blame someone for the collapse of retail, blame the relentless profiteers who have slashed wages and staffing to the bone while jacking up prices, and then point the finger at shrink losses that have always existed to keep their workers angry and divided.", "Obvious NTA, to the point where there must be more going on in your friend\u2019s life/mind/relationship with you to explain this.", "NTA.  A \"swap meet\" is like a garage sale, or what we call a \"car boot sale\" in the UK?  A bunch of people setting up stalls together to sell off spare domestic items, with a few dealers selling second-hand goods or discontinued commercial products?  Who could have a problem with that?", "NTA\n\nPlenty of people buy bulk lots of unsold/surplus merch, or partial cases that had some shipping damage to part of the lot, and break them out at flea markets. Assuming everything there is stolen is a really shitty mindset on your friend's part.", "When all of my kids were little and I was a SAHM I would shop sales combined with coupons and then resell items locally at a small profit. It was a fun way to earn a little extra money while keeping my math and reasoning skills sharp. Not all items for sale like this are stolen. NTA.", "? How is that a big savings when mouth wash is at dollar storea", "YTA .\n\nYes, soaps, mouthwash, etc. sold at swapmeets are usually stolen (people who buy cleaning consumables generally just use them up) and the fact that you defend buying stolen merchandise because it's cheaper for you is pretty insufferable. \n\nIf you'd just said \"oh, I didn't know, sorry,\" you could have salvaged the friendship, but you doubled down and then tried to act the victim over it.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Does she actually work for a big box store or has she been suckered in by a MLM to shill cheap jewelry or crappy protein shakes?", "First of all, it's ludicrous to assume that the item was stolen in the first place.\n\nSecond, If someone is stealing mouthwash and selling it for $2, they probably need the money more than Wal-Mart.\n\nNTA.", "I brought up that point as well, but she believes her retail job is in jeopardy solely because of shoplifters and my \u201ccomplicit\u201d activity. I disagree; I think many other corporate factors determine a store closure/sales clerk layoffs.", "PREACH xoxo", "Something must be going on in the universe\u2026", "Capitalism ; )", "I felt the same way. That swap meet is entirely POC and I felt her rash disdain had a racist/classist undertone to it. My mindset is we are ALL peasants, so her attitude was ironic to me.", "I learned this from my mom, too.  Your kids will thank you later if not already", "When in Rome", "This is such a funny take to me. Walmart et al are raking in insane profits under the guise of \u201cinflation.\u201d I\u2019m not pro-stealing but it makes it a little difficult to feel bad for them. \n\nNTA, OP. They may or may not have been stolen, you don\u2019t know either way. I\u2019m not shedding a tear for the big boxes regardless.", "Exactly OP YTA, you had to have know it was most likely stolen right?", "Her retail job is in jeopardy because of Amazon and online shopping. Oh, also corporate greed. As soon as they figure out how to stock shelves with robots rather than humans, those jobs are out as well. They\u2019re already removing cashiers from almost everywhere. It\u2019s mostly self scan with maybe one human cashier due to alcohol, tobacco, and gift card sales. \n\nYour friend needs to chill. Places like Walmart and Target aren\u2019t going anywhere. They\u2019re the giants that get to exist by stomping all over mom and pop shops that couldn\u2019t even come close to competing.", "She does have a point that stores are closing and then people lose jobs. It\u2019s on the state where I live for example stopped prosecuting shoplifting under 900 so organized groups each rob that much and stores have been closing.\n\nBut there is no way of knowing if what you bought is stolen. I thought a lot of people in these shoplift rings resold online via Amazon and eBay and FB marketplace", "Lol yeah, maybe a full moon", "For sure! The older kids had fun helping me figure out how to maximize deals, and enjoyed manning tables at garage sales and such when we would sell items.", "I had a friends mom, who was an extreme couponing and she managed to get 2 pallets of cereal free and the store had to order it separately anyway the day it came she had the local food bank get it.", "I agree with the sentiment that even small changes like avoiding large box stores can send a message to big corporations. I've been boycotting them myself for quite some time and it feels good to make a statement without making a large sacrifice. It's empowering to take control of where our money is going and show that we won't take poor corporate behavior.", "It\u2019s not the store it\u2019s the employees if corporate decides to shut down a store that\u2019s the concern here and valid", "That was never in my mind, no. I was merely thinking about how I\u2019ve been out of mouthwash for the past week. Anyone who has those heated thoughts of stolen/not stolen might as well never step foot into a swap meet.", "She certainly did not want to hear these facts from me. In fact, she went as far as blocking me from her phone.", "So therefore I\u2019m supposed to pledge to her that I\u2019ll be a loyalist to, say, Target for all my shopping needs? And tbh I don\u2019t care to meddle in millions of people\u2019s hustles.", "Like many people now, I am a longtime vintage/junk hunter/reseller as side hustle/hobby; grew up working at swap meets with my parents\u2014So I guess it\u2019s always been in my nature to cut corners where I can on the mundane crap we all have to buy, so that I have a little more money left over for food and other more interesting stuff. I just don\u2019t feel bad about it, but she wanted me to, for \u2018her livelihood\u2019. To me it\u2019s reaching, just like she was overreaching by telling me how/where to spend my honestly-earned money.", "We all have concerns about losing our jobs, but why AITA for my benign $2 purchase? She chose to reach and target ME with contempt, under pure assumption.", "If you regularly go to swap meats wouldn\u2019t you be more aware of what is likely to be stolen goods vs actual second hand purchases? \n\nI get maybe you just forgot for a minute but there are organised gangs who will arrange for \u2018petty\u2019 theft of easily re-sellable goods. Things like coffee, nappies, toothpaste and other hygiene products are super common", "Did you really need a friend who would end a friendship because you didn\u2019t buy your mouthwash from Target?", "Whenever I go to swap meets, my focus is much more on finding the old stuff. Might I add I\u2019m more concerned about high crimes, living in a country with a twice-impeached former President with 91 felony charges, who stole nuclear secrets and whose son-in-law stole billions to hand off to our adversaries. That\u2019s why I tried to tell her we have much bigger fish to fry.", "I had to ask her that, too, before she blocked me. Really?!"]}
