I get that this is a friend that you\u2019ve never seen as more than just a platonic one. However, your wife has expressed before your marriage that she was feeling uncomfortable that she hasn\u2019t met this bestie of yours and for some reason, she has YET to meet this friend of yours. How long has your marriage been that your partner has not met this friend due to \u201ccircumstances\u201d? If you two have been married less than 2 years, I think this is a N A H issue. \n\nBut my dude. If you\u2019ve been married for 5 years and your WIFE STILL HASNT met this friend, I am giving major side eye. When I began dating my ex many moons ago, I wanted to meet a bestie of his but something ALWAYS came up. And that was because homegirl never wanted to meet ME. Despite the fact my ex and I were serious together, she never wanted us to hangout the 3 of us because he was her friend not mine. And I was like, I just wanna meet you once my girl, wtaf?? So ya. This post is somewhat triggering lol.", "Info: how many times a day do you text this friend? Have you and this friend had history romantic or sexual?", "Info: Why is it so important to text her daily? What are the texts about?\n\nI feel like I'm getting mixed messages here. On the one hand, she's not that close, you only see her a few times a year. But at the same time, this is another woman you have to text every day. I can definitely see where your wife's discomfort comes from. \n\nProbably not a donkey if it's a meme exchanged once a day at work. \n\nBut if it's good morning texts, messaging throughout the day, etc. your wife is justified in feeling upset, imo", "Info: are you making the same effort to text and talk your wife each day as you are your friend?", "The optics are bad. Even though it\u2019s in no way romantic, and it\u2019s all surface level texting, your wife sees:\n\n\u2022you responding to multiple texts \n\u2022your attention is being taken up by a woman she doesn\u2019t know\n\u2022you\u2019re allowing a woman she doesn\u2019t know unfettered access to you\n\nWhat you\u2019re doing is innocent enough but it doesn\u2019t look that way and you dismissing her feelings makes it worse, so flip it and ask yourself if she has male friend who has this same level of access to her and she was dismissing your concerns, would you be ok with it? \nNo matter how long your friendship is with that woman, you have made it uncomfortable for your wife and you should immediately scale back. \nI have best friends going back 35 years, and I would never think to do this\u2026..", "This whole thing is really weird and I'm giving it some side eye. Meeting someone in passing can be enough to know you don't want to get to know them more. She probably has a reason why and a reason why this makes her uncomfortable. You saying it's platonic, doesn't mean that it hasn't had blurry lines/ boundary crosses that you may be oblivious about, but your wife might not be.\n\nThere are boundaries within marriage. One that she seems to have mentioned before you got married. Nothing wrong with opposite gender friends, but I think you're on the line of YTA because this seems really off to me.", "INFO. Why is she uncomfortable? Is this your only female friend? Did you ever date her at any point, or were there ever any romantic feelings? How often do you see her in person?", "Info:\nWhy hasn't it \"worked out\" when you tried making plans for the three of you to get together?", "Info: do you ignore your wife/messages from your wife? \n\nDo you spend so much time on your phone texting this woman that it's obvious, uncomfortable, and rude to the people around you?", "Nope. NTA. It doesn\u2019t matter, their gender is just a part of them. Unless she has valid reason to think that one of your best friends is gonna convince you to cheat on her, there is nothing to see here", "INFO: what are you texting about? Talking with a friend daily is normal and fine, unless of course it's not.", "Something specific is making her uncomfortable.  Your best bet is to find out what and figure out how to fix it.  If you refuse and ignore her feelings, you\u2019ve placed friend above wife.  \n\nIt sounds like it all has to do with these \u201cmeetups that never worked out\u201d.  This is a big gap in the story, I\u2019m confused why it\u2019s being left out.  If it was just you texting the amount you claim you are she would have mentioned it before.  This delay in getting to know each other is making her more and more uncomfortable.  Sounds like wife is down to get to know her so what exactly isn\u2019t working out?  Your answer is probably in that", "Info - How much texting are we talking about?  It appears that it is enough that it can be ignored?  What type of things do you both talk about?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt seems like an odd thing to get upset about, unless it is a significant amount, or the topics are something that they should not be.  Have you tried letting your wife read through them?", "I guess the question is what does it hurt to slow it down a little?  Obviously continuing the amount of texting with your bf is hurting your wife\u2019s feelings.  She feels left out. How do you want her to feel? How does she know how often you text your bf? Are you telling your bf things before you tell your wife? Are you consulting your bf opinion before your wife? You\u2019re married.  Things change when you\u2019re married and your bf (if they are really a friend) would understand that.  It\u2019s hard for me to believe this is all about friendship/ relationships.  It feels like this is a control issue for you or something.  You just flat out refuse to stop texting so much without regard to your wife\u2019s feelings? Have you told your bf how your wife feels? What input did your bf give? Because a real friend would not want your wife to be miserable and would make a better effort to include your wife IMO. \n\nI can\u2019t say you\u2019re a total AH but neither is your wife.  She just wants all of you and doesn\u2019t want to feel like an outsider.  You chose her, but now you\u2019re telling her your bf is more important.", "INFO others have asked and no response. How many texts per day, how long are the texts? If cumulative time is greater than 30 minutes every day, then YTA, not because she's female but because that is too much. Texting had allowed people to constantly have outside lives while living with their family but not actually being present.", "So your discussion your marriage issues outside of marriage with another person and it's not a therapist. With everything you've said it sounds like emotional cheating and it's still cheating.", "If you have a close friend that you have known since childhood, communicate with daily and meet once or twice a year *and your spouse hasn't even met them*, unless you've known  with your spouse for less than a year YTA.", "Edited: oh. YTA. Just saw this:\n\n'She told me prior to marriage that she couldn\u2019t see being comfortable with a husband who had such frequent texting with another female that she didn\u2019t really know. I thought once she saw we were purely platonic she would see it was nothing and be okay. Since we haven\u2019t had a real chance to hang out with my friend as a group, she feels she\u2019s not been given a chance to get to know my friend and has asked texting to slow down until she feels more comfortable.'\n\nSo you knew fine well she wasn't comfortable with this but decided it'd be fine without making any effort to make your wife feel comfortable. Definite AH. Your wife is actually being reasonable here.\n\n'She has given me relationship advise a time or two'\n\nYikes.\n\n\nNAH. I don't think she's an AH for being honest with you about how she feels and what she wants. As it stands, I don't think you're an AH for saying 'no'. However, I am interested in what has changed and why your wife is asking this now?", "Info: how often are you texting? And is it significantly more than other people in your contacts? And are you talking about significantly emotional things?", "I'm curious about the  volume and frequency of texting. What do two friends have to say to each other that requires everyday contact?\n\nINFO", "YTA you shouldn\u2019t be texting this friend every day that\u2019s just weird. Would you be fine with it if your wife was texting another guy every day? Even texting every few days or weekly would be way more normal", "YTA. She might be overreacting, but that doesn't mean you just dismiss her concerns. Your wife is telling you that she isn't comfortable with this much communication. She is your wife, put her feelings first, even when you don't agree with them. That is how marriage works to me. \n\nInvite the friend over, hang out all together, do whatever it takes for your wife to see there is no threat here. If this person is such a close friend, then she will understand if you need to cool it for a little while until your wife comes around. \n\nDismissing her concerns outright will only make your wife DIG IN MORE and ultimately might lead to her deciding you should not have this friend AT ALL since you can't seem to agree to any boundary that doesn't allow you to communicate as freely as you would like. \n\nYou better start listening and start working towards a solution here. The way you are behaving right now - you are acting as though this friendship is more important than your marriage. YOU are making this an even bigger issue than it is - and forcing an all or nothing situation where in the end - you will have to choose between your wife and this friendship.", "Truthfully yes. Now you will get a bunch of this is silly, stand up for yourself etc. but the reality is she is your wife that fact tops all", "Since she is a childhood friend with no sexual history I feel like your friendship is fine however, I don\u2019t text anyone everyday or even every other day. I guess you would say my husband I guess I do text everyday if we are at work.  I believe your texting is a bit much, maybe try to stay busy with something else.", "I\u2019m leaning towards NTA with the info given, however; it\u2019s odd this never came up before the marriage. I assume the wife has known about this friendship the whole time so why now is it a problem? I think as long as the texts aren\u2019t flirty in nature then it wouldn\u2019t be an issue for me as long as I was getting the same level of attention and communication. If you\u2019re telling her things you aren\u2019t telling your wife though then that would bother me. I\u2019d need more context on what type of communication is taking place to know for sure.", "If your wife does not want you to share friendship with females she does not have a close friendship with then prioritize your wife. Why is this an issue. It would be a beautiful signal to the people around you if you show that your wife is the woman in your life. She should trust you, yes, but if she wants to be the only female you share things with then let her have that.", "I kinda think YTA. Your wife didn\u2019t tell you to stop talking to her, she said she was uncomfortable with the frequency, and that\u2019s fair\u2026 especially since your wife communicated that she would be uncomfortable with it before you got married. \nI truly believe there is no reason you need to go to another female your wife hasn\u2019t met for relationship advice.", "NTA, my closest friend is a guy and I am female, my husband knew that when we got together. I could not imagine my husband trying to take away a good friend and support. Your wife is the AH!", "NTA. My husband has a female friend since they were in grade school. He texts her, even goes to her house to hangout without me. I trust the both of them. \n\nI will say, you and your wife need to have a serious talk about why she is so insecure about the friendship.", "NTA, your wife has some insecurity issues to address.", "NTA. Your life long friend is not your wife's competition. Maybe you need to sit and have an evening with your wife and ask her what is making her insecure about your friendship", "NTA my husband has female friends he texts with. I used to be insecure, he let me read what was going on. After I saw it was nothing, I didn\u2019t care anymore.", "Info. Hypothetically, if you had to choose, which relationship is more important - wife or friend?", "NTA. This issue comes up a lot in this sub. Lots of people can\u2019t really believe that men and women might be friends for reasons other than sex. That\u2019s their problem, not yours.", "YTA do you want a wife or do you want the friend.", "NTA. If it\u2019s completely platonic like you\u2019re saying then she shouldn\u2019t be worried but I do understand how she would be. Are you as close to your wife as your friend? Do you include your wife in the things this lady says that may make you laugh or smile when you read those messages?", "NTA, I may be assuming here but it sounds like wife has known about this relationship for quite some time, perhaps even pre-wedding. This was not a former romantic partner but and actual friend you have had since childhood. That your wife is experiencing insecurities or jealousy is an issue she needs to deal with, it is not reasonable for her to ask you to limit your contact.", "NTA.
