Are their no Uber or Lyft type ride sharing services in your area?", "NTA. What's with the YTA and ESH? OP, your parents are ADULTS. They are responsible for their choices to drink. If they want to go out and get drunk with their friends, they need to take the initiative to call a cab or have someone drive back them back home as a DD. You're not their babysitter. When both you and your parents have calm down, you make this clear and tell them that you're not their chauffeur or DD.", "NTA\nYour parents chose to go out drinking and it is their responsibility to find a safe way home.

This is literally the least you could have done for them, something they probably don't do that often.\n\nI get it your 19 and it can be an incredibly selfish age, doing things for your parents is considered bottom of the list, but just think about all the things they are doing for you and how generous they are to you, and next time do them a solid and pick them up.", "Do regular cabs not exist?", "ESH... kinda. I get why you wanted to sleep, but if you didn't have any commitment early in the morning, maybe a nap and an alarm around midnight would have gone a long way. \n\nThat being said, drowsy driving is actually more dangerous than drunk driving. Your brain needs rest but also knows you have to operate the vehicle, so it does a sick-fuck compromise by putting you to sleep at the wheel while making you dream of driving.\n\nSounds like you and the parents aren't good at communicating. Also they aren't charging rent, so, if you don't give a little on things like this, that may change soon.", "NTA it's not like you don't have to get up for a 6am shift. That's really unreasonable. Spare me the well how many rides have they given you last I checked you didn't ask to be born. Also parents love supporting but when they can't get their way then you're freeloading. Nope if you didn't have work I could see them being upset however you're an adult with a job.", "NTA, this sub is about morals no legality and IMO your parents are morally obligated to support you until you are capable of supporting yourself, the age where you can support yourself has risen so \"18 = independent adult\" is no longer true.", "YTA", "Not really no.

Bravo!", "I would normally agree that you shouldn't make a big deal and just sober cab for your parents as i have done it often enough. But and this is a huge one coming from personal experience. Driving while being drowsy is super dangerous, your reaction time is super delayed and you might fall asleep even if it's just for a second. And having people with you in the car who also are under the influence of alcohol (even the tiniest amount can worsen your reaction a lot) will not make the whole ordeal safer.", "Really just don\u2019t get why it had to be me though. \n\nThey ended up getting a ride from my sister\u2019s boyfriend who was going to be staying up later than that anyways to do I don\u2019t want to know what with my sister", "TBH the parents are kind of dumb for asking a sleepy person to drive.

No one takes away from my sleep time.", "This sub is about morals not laws so the letter of the law does not matter here.\n\nParents are morally obligated to support their children until their children can support themselves, the age at which one can be self sufficient has risen so \"18=independent adult\" is no longer a valid standard.", "Spoken like someone that shouldn't be allowed to have children, last thing we need is for you to make more like yourself.", "Doesn\u2019t matter why they asked you and not another.

Driving while sleep deprived/tired is dangerous too!", "YTA \n\nFirst of all saying 'sober-cab' is a nonsense way of saying 'your parents asked you to pick them up'.  \n\nIs your relationship that bad with your parents that you won't do them a favour?  In your post there is no indication they have been poor parents.  These are the people that raised you, fed you, wiped your arse when you had filled your nappy (diaper), cuddled you when you were upset and you won't help them have a night out and let their hair down?\n\nHow many nights out and drinks do you think they missed because they were too busy raising you?\n\nLet's just hope they never get old and need any favours from you.  No doubt 'grocery-cab', 'hospital-cab', 'funeral -cab'  will be equally unwilling to do any simple favours.", "YTA. Sounds like you have nice parents who don't ask a lot of you and are very supportive. Being able to support them from time to time as you mature is an important part of growing up.

Your parents WANTED to go party and get drunk, they didn't NEED to go party and get drunk. It is completely possible to go out to a festival with friends and have fun WITHOUT getting drunk. Also, no is a perfectly valid answer and they should have accepted your answer and worked to find another option (which they apparently did). This will sound petty, but perhaps from now on you should find someplace to stay that isn't your parents house. Maybe stay where your college is (in other words, get an apartment there even if it's a cheap efficiency) except for one week (or a couple of days) per break (i.e winter/Christmas and summer) when you would then go back to your parents town and visit, but stay at a motel/hotel during that week so as not to \"burden\" them with your presence in the house. After all, if they expect you to \"pay them back\" by catering to their every need then they should expect that you will remove yourself from that situation. And if they choose to passive aggressively ignore you, turn it back on them. When they complain, point out that they decided that they didn't want to interact with you, so you made it easier on them to not interact by not trying to do so with them. They are seeking for you to basically come crawling on your knees begging forgiveness for not catering to them at which point they will magnanimously forgive you and basically say all is normal now (until they pull this again in a week's time...).", "If you had to work again in the morning then NTA. However, if you didn't then ask yourself how much do they do for me and how much have they done for me in the past? How many rides did they give me growing up that they probably didn't want to do? They could have also told you if you want to go find your own way.", "NTA. It's not unreasonable for them to ask, but perfectly reasonable for you to refuse.\n\nIf you're living there full-time and they want you to contribute to the house, that's a separate issue and you should be prepared to pitch in financially.

The alcohol part is irrelevant.", "Here here........I know many people who were shown the door at 18.  OP's parents let them live there rent free even though they have a job!

If you have a shred of decency you'll start paying rent tomorrow.", "Lol, I didn't say anything about laws.\n\nAnd they are supporting him, but I guess I'm of the opinion that young adults can show kindness back to their parents, it's a basic moral trait that should be taught more or encouraged in kids growing up and definitely when they get to that young adult 18, 19 yr old stage of their life. \n\nI firmly believe that when you hit those 18+ years you have to be less selfish, yes a lot of kids still rely on their parents financially etc, and that's fine, but it's about give and take, and giving back to the people who have been so generous to you. I don't believe in just shrugging your shoulders as a 19r old living at home and going \"I don't have to help you because you're morally obligated to support me\".\n\nParents just want a little kindness back, they genuinely ask for so little most of the time and give so much of their love and kindness, and I can understand how they were disappointed with their son here.", "1) I have no kids, 2) I wouldn't expect my kids to ever be a 1am cabbie"]}
