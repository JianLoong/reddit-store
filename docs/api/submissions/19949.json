Also, no is a perfectly valid answer and they should have accepted your answer and worked to find another option (which they apparently did). This will sound petty, but perhaps from now on you should find someplace to stay that isn't your parents house. Maybe stay where your college is (in other words, get an apartment there even if it's a cheap efficiency) except for one week (or a couple of days) per break (i.e winter/Christmas and summer) when you would then go back to your parents town and visit, but stay at a motel/hotel during that week so as not to \"burden\" them with your presence in the house. After all, if they expect you to \"pay them back\" by catering to their every need then they should expect that you will remove yourself from that situation. And if they choose to passive aggressively ignore you, turn it back on them. When they complain, point out that they decided that they didn't want to interact with you, so you made it easier on them to not interact by not trying to do so with them. They are seeking for you to basically come crawling on your knees begging forgiveness for not catering to them at which point they will magnanimously forgive you and basically say all is normal now (until they pull this again in a week's time...).", "If you had to work again in the morning then NTA.

It's not unreasonable for them to ask, but perfectly reasonable for you to refuse.\n\nIf you're living there full-time and they want you to contribute to the house, that's a separate issue and you should be prepared to pitch in financially.

I am a Midwesterner from a small town with no cab services, and this is a really tough position for you. \n\nBeing the DD should not be expected when you aren't even present at the event or if it's late at night when you're normally sleeping. When I would go out with friends being the DD, we would meet up with other friend groups, and suddenly, people expected me to do several trips back and forth to pick up groups 2, 3, etc. It was unreasonable to suddenly be 10 peoples' sober cab, which often happens in small towns. I stayed out later than I actually wanted to because my friends wanted to bar close, or I'd have to wrangle  up people to go the car. Being the DD makes you suddenly responsible for everyone. I am a drinker, so I've seen and been on both sides. \n\nIt's unreasonable for people to say, \"You could have just woken up and got them.\" Nope, when you're already sleeping, you might not wake up to the call, or you might be groggy behind the wheel. You aren't their on call ride.\n\nYour parents are helping you out and asking you for a ride to work, an appointment, or the airport is understandable.

I assume they have lived there long enough to figure out other ride alternatives... Trading DD responsibilities with friends, walking, camping, or sleeping in the car. Most Midwestern festivals allow camping or sleeping in your car. It is not uncommon. And I've had friends walk 30/ 40 minutes when there is no ride available.

So what if they want to drink, they are responsible enough and safe enough to say hey we might drink and it would be better if we didn't drive, please be our ride. But that is too much to ask? Ya I've worked long hard shifts too, back to back.

My now 18 year old niece is tickled pink that I am her on-demand 'uber' because of an agreement I made with my sister. I don't ever want her to feel she is stuck somewhere and would make poor choices like driving after drinking, sometimes she uses it. She knows no matter what time of day, call me.

If they had asked, you could have asked for a shift change at work to accommodate that, or they could have had more time to ask people, or could go home with one of their friends for the evening if you couldn't get work to do a shift change, or nobody said yes to driving.\n\nYes giving them the ride would have been the nice thing to do but with no opportunities to safely take a nap and make sure you're up in time it's a little unreasonable to expect you to say yes on the short notice.", "NTA... you're the _adult_ here.

I think a lot of people are seeing the \u201crent free\u201d and \u201cdrinking\u201d part and making a lot of assumptions. In my area, it\u2019s very common for young adults to live rent free at their parent\u2019s house over the summer in college.

There was definitely a solution to this. You could\u2019ve still slept for 3-4 hours but put an alarm on, picked them up and gone back to sleep when you were home. I\u2019ve done it plenty of times for my brother and my friends whenever they\u2019ve needed a lift. If my parents ever asked I\u2019d do the same for them too.

Picking up kids from parties, getting up early to catch a 4am flight for work, soothing a crying baby multiple times a night. \n\nThis doesn't read as an unreasonable request from parents, it reads like an ungrateful lazy child trying to find excuses to avoid doing something he simply doesn't want to do.

They didn't want their kids riding her bike home in the dark over rural roads, so they would pick me (and my friends) up at a designated time. Sometimes that was 3 am. Usually someone else's parents dropped us off. Those other parents must have thought they were getting the best deal ever. Not having to get up in the middle of the night and not having a bunch of moody teen girls in the house on a weekend morning.\n\nThey did the same thing for brother and his friends. \n\nSo I'd do this for my parents, but that's partly because they did it for me.", "Im from the US, from the midwest specifically, and I have lived in three different states in the midwest and I have never heard the term \"sober-cab\" in my life.

OP states that he had worked multiple early shifts in a row, he\u2019s not saying he wouldn\u2019t pick up groceries or drop them off at the doctor. He told them the reason was because of the time, not the driving itself. If a parent told their kid that they couldn\u2019t go to a party because it ended late, that would be a resounding NTA, so why doesn\u2019t that respect go both ways? It has nothing to do with paying rent, it\u2019s respecting that your child is tired and maybe having an exhausted 19 y/o drive around at 1 am isn\u2019t a phenomenal idea anyway", "Well it's not like OP asked to be born. That the parents missed nights out is kinda their fault. Don't get a child if you don't want to provide for it. And just because someone isn't underaged it doesn't mean the parents aren't responsible for their child anymore. Even if for some messed up reason it's not legally required anymore you can't think that a kid turns 18 and suddenly is on their own. That should be obvious. OP is a college student and works part time. He provides his own food. I don't think that there is much money left to pay rent. Maybe a little but if the parents never asked for it it's their problem.\nAlso work is kinda more important than picking up somone. People need sleep.

Nevermind four. It's understandable to be tired.\n\n2) The level of exhaustion you have is likely worse than them driving drunk, especially considering your recent sleep pattern to accommodate your schedule would aggravate the feelings of exhaustion. Most people don't actually know this, especially older generations- so it's possible they thought of it as an excuse. Especially if they've never driven that exhausted.\n\n3) You ARE an adult, even if you're just 19. They see you as a responsible person.

Not instigating a fight or outright refusing without explanation- don't your remember all the times they'd refuse or demand something and then give you a null explanation? Like \"because I'm your parent/because I said so\" ect.\n\n4) They had no right to guilt trip you, since they had never asked for anything in return for you living there rent free. There wasn't an expectation to be held to.\nYou do your personal responsibilities, but in the eyes of your parents, especially considering you're a very young adult still, maybe you should also contribute to the common areas? Maybe pitch in for groceries or something, help clean up. Offer to pay a portion of the rent. That way they can't use that tactic again. They still see you as their kid, at very least when it's useful for them, and that you're an adult when it's useful for them.\n\n5) Your sisters boyfriend got brownie points, but isn't he under 18?

If I were in your shoes, I'd probably offer to pay for their cab, since I assume even in small towns there's usually a cab company or two. \n\n7) Yes wait times are longer than expected in a high population area, but it's called planning ahead. Uber has a way for you to schedule your ride ahead of time, for example. Or you can call the cab company and ask how long a cab would take to get to you a while earlier than you plan to leave.
