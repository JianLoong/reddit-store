Also, no is a perfectly valid answer and they should have accepted your answer and worked to find another option (which they apparently did). This will sound petty, but perhaps from now on you should find someplace to stay that isn't your parents house. Maybe stay where your college is (in other words, get an apartment there even if it's a cheap efficiency) except for one week (or a couple of days) per break (i.e winter/Christmas and summer) when you would then go back to your parents town and visit, but stay at a motel/hotel during that week so as not to \"burden\" them with your presence in the house. After all, if they expect you to \"pay them back\" by catering to their every need then they should expect that you will remove yourself from that situation. And if they choose to passive aggressively ignore you, turn it back on them. When they complain, point out that they decided that they didn't want to interact with you, so you made it easier on them to not interact by not trying to do so with them. They are seeking for you to basically come crawling on your knees begging forgiveness for not catering to them at which point they will magnanimously forgive you and basically say all is normal now (until they pull this again in a week's time...).", "If you had to work again in the morning then NTA. However, if you didn't then ask yourself how much do they do for me and how much have they done for me in the past? How many rides did they give me growing up that they probably didn't want to do?

It's not unreasonable for them to ask, but perfectly reasonable for you to refuse.\n\nIf you're living there full-time and they want you to contribute to the house, that's a separate issue and you should be prepared to pitch in financially.

I am a Midwesterner from a small town with no cab services, and this is a really tough position for you. \n\nBeing the DD should not be expected when you aren't even present at the event or if it's late at night when you're normally sleeping. When I would go out with friends being the DD, we would meet up with other friend groups, and suddenly, people expected me to do several trips back and forth to pick up groups 2, 3, etc. It was unreasonable to suddenly be 10 peoples' sober cab, which often happens in small towns. I stayed out later than I actually wanted to because my friends wanted to bar close, or I'd have to wrangle  up people to go the car. Being the DD makes you suddenly responsible for everyone. I am a drinker, so I've seen and been on both sides. \n\nIt's unreasonable for people to say, \"You could have just woken up and got them.\" Nope, when you're already sleeping, you might not wake up to the call, or you might be groggy behind the wheel. You aren't their on call ride.\n\nYour parents are helping you out and asking you for a ride to work, an appointment, or the airport is understandable. But asking you for a ride at an uncertain time from a drinking event is not your problem at 19, especially at 12/ 1 a.m.. I assume they have lived there long enough to figure out other ride alternatives... Trading DD responsibilities with friends, walking, camping, or sleeping in the car. Most Midwestern festivals allow camping or sleeping in your car. It is not uncommon. And I've had friends walk 30/ 40 minutes when there is no ride available.

So what if they want to drink, they are responsible enough and safe enough to say hey we might drink and it would be better if we didn't drive, please be our ride. But that is too much to ask? Ya I've worked long hard shifts too, back to back. If one of my loved ones asked me for a ride knowing they might drink and didn't want to be unsafe hell yes I would say yes.  \n\n\nI live in the same country as he does and I've never heard it called a sober-cab, everyone has always asked me hey Far can you be my DD?

In my area, it\u2019s very common for young adults to live rent free at their parent\u2019s house over the summer in college.

There was definitely a solution to this. You could\u2019ve still slept for 3-4 hours but put an alarm on, picked them up and gone back to sleep when you were home. I\u2019ve done it plenty of times for my brother and my friends whenever they\u2019ve needed a lift. If my parents ever asked I\u2019d do the same for them too. Only times I\u2019ve ever said no is if I\u2019m already out and won\u2019t be sober or have to be up early for work.\n\nI\u2019d say your parents only suck because they kept pushing the matter and they\u2019re being passive aggressive about the fact you said no.

Picking up kids from parties, getting up early to catch a 4am flight for work, soothing a crying baby multiple times a night. \n\nThis doesn't read as an unreasonable request from parents, it reads like an ungrateful lazy child trying to find excuses to avoid doing something he simply doesn't want to do.

They didn't want their kids riding her bike home in the dark over rural roads, so they would pick me (and my friends) up at a designated time. Sometimes that was 3 am. Usually someone else's parents dropped us off. Those other parents must have thought they were getting the best deal ever. Not having to get up in the middle of the night and not having a bunch of moody teen girls in the house on a weekend morning.\n\nThey did the same thing for brother and his friends. \n\nSo I'd do this for my parents, but that's partly because they did it for me.", "Im from the US, from the midwest specifically, and I have lived in three different states in the midwest and I have never heard the term \"sober-cab\" in my life.

He told them the reason was because of the time, not the driving itself. If a parent told their kid that they couldn\u2019t go to a party because it ended late, that would be a resounding NTA, so why doesn\u2019t that respect go both ways? It has nothing to do with paying rent, it\u2019s respecting that your child is tired and maybe having an exhausted 19 y/o drive around at 1 am isn\u2019t a phenomenal idea anyway", "Well it's not like OP asked to be born. That the parents missed nights out is kinda their fault. Don't get a child if you don't want to provide for it. And just because someone isn't underaged it doesn't mean the parents aren't responsible for their child anymore. Even if for some messed up reason it's not legally required anymore you can't think that a kid turns 18 and suddenly is on their own. That should be obvious. OP is a college student and works part time. He provides his own food. I don't think that there is much money left to pay rent. Maybe a little but if the parents never asked for it it's their problem.\nAlso work is kinda more important than picking up somone. People need sleep.

Nevermind four. It's understandable to be tired.\n\n2) The level of exhaustion you have is likely worse than them driving drunk, especially considering your recent sleep pattern to accommodate your schedule would aggravate the feelings of exhaustion. Most people don't actually know this, especially older generations- so it's possible they thought of it as an excuse. Especially if they've never driven that exhausted.\n\n3) You ARE an adult, even if you're just 19. They see you as a responsible person.

Like \"because I'm your parent/because I said so\" ect.\n\n4) They had no right to guilt trip you, since they had never asked for anything in return for you living there rent free. There wasn't an expectation to be held to.\nYou do your personal responsibilities, but in the eyes of your parents, especially considering you're a very young adult still, maybe you should also contribute to the common areas? Maybe pitch in for groceries or something, help clean up. Offer to pay a portion of the rent. That way they can't use that tactic again. They still see you as their kid, at very least when it's useful for them, and that you're an adult when it's useful for them.\n\n5) Your sisters boyfriend got brownie points, but isn't he under 18?

Uber has a way for you to schedule your ride ahead of time, for example. Or you can call the cab company and ask how long a cab would take to get to you a while earlier than you plan to leave.

They can make demands or requirements for your room and board, and those might not be good for you. \n\nBecome independent from this unhealthy atmosphere.\n\nAs for their getting an Uber, I live in a rural area of the US, on a dirt road, without cell service. I can get an Uber with plenty of lead time, detailed instructions on navigating the unmarked dirt roads, and having given multiple places for them to pull over where there\u2019s cell service to call my landline if they get lost. I don\u2019t know if your rural area has Uber available, but where there\u2019s a will, there\u2019s a way. They can either coordinate Uber, or air their dirty laundry and pay someone local to be their driver.", "Why is it so vital for them to drink to excess? Are they quiet alcoholics? No judgement, just trying to understand whether the urge was to go to the festival or to go drinking", "NTA.  Your parents are very entitled and need to make other arrangements just like they did.", "NTA. Even if you had done it because you didn\u2019t want to enable their drinking problem, that would be your right. They asked for a favor, you politely declined, they got someone else to do it. That\u2019s all completely reasonable, no matter the reason.", "It\u2019s normally called DD in the US. I\u2019m in the SW US and I\u2019ve never heard it be called sober cab", "Nah! You want to get shit faced as an adult you deal with the way you get a ride home and accept some people aren\u2019t able to. Either gain a healthy relationship with alcohol or stop drinking. You don\u2019t have to drink over the driving limit to have a good time and if you feel you do then you need to reevaluate alcohol all together. NTA", "It reads like the OP judging their parents for drinking and passive aggressively punishing them for it.", "I think you\u2019re entirely missing the parent/child dynamic. If you view children as \u201ctakers\u201d \u2026 I don\u2019t even know what to say to that. \n\nI never said people shouldn\u2019t do nice things for their parents. However, saying no to a simple request doesn\u2019t make you a bad person. No one has to say yes to everything, including their parents.", "That\u2019s between OP and their parents. It also has nothing to do with the issue at hand.", "I have driven my parents many, many places, and I would not feel comfortable filling the request either. Some people have very valid reasons to either a) not want to drive at 1 AM or b) don\u2019t want to see their parents drink. For me, it\u2019s firmly in the latter because of my own life experiences, I\u2019m not sure about OP. It just seems ironic so say that the sub is backing him up because he\u2019s a teen, when most of the people here are pissed that his parents had to get someone else to chaperone them", "You can use military ID to prove you are 21 or older to buy alcohol now. You used to need a driver's license or state issued ID only. Now they allow passports and military ID. But this is a state by state thing.", "Oh please, most parents do a lot more for their kids than they are legally obligated to do & expecting them to pitch in a little as they get older is not selfish.  I remember when my siblings got their licenses & part of that privilege was taking your younger siblings places or stopping to pick up groceries.  Once I had my license, I ran errands for my parents, took my little sister places.  It wasn't abuse or shitty parenting.  Get off the high horse.  The OP is living at home, rent free (not a legal obligation).  Her parents want a ride home.  You may it work.  It's the give & take of families.", "You are racist", "No, as a matter of legality, he is not entitled to live rent free with his parents.  They\u2019re being generous and he\u2019s spitting in their face.", "Now you know next time just to work in your city and find Sumner accommodation, your safety is more important than their desire to get wasted.", "I wasn\u2019t talking about OP specifically. I was talking about the parent/child relationship. People keep referring to \u201call the things the parents did for OP when they were a child\u201d as THE reason that OP now needs to pay them back and do this favor. That\u2019s not how it works. The relationship isn\u2019t transactional.", "He\u2019s living in there home as an adult \nIt\u2019s called give and take that\u2019s how normal healthy relationships as adults work.  It\u2019s never one sided !", "Children do have responsibilities to be decent people to their parents.  I know it\u2019s a crazy concept to teens but it\u2019s true.  Also, their obligations end at adulthood.", "People are acting like this is a 27 y/o man, when staying with your parents rent free over the summer is exceedingly common in college.", "Right, sometimes you give, sometimes you don\u2019t. In this case, OP didn\u2019t give. What\u2019s the problem?", "\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffb", "Lol you're either \u00e0 napper or someone that has never tried", "It says in his post that his mom got mad and said to him he should stay up and come pick them up.", "YTA \n\nYou're just a crappy person for not caring about how your parents get home safely. I can't imagine telling my parents not to call me if they need help getting home safely, for *any* reason, at *any* time, and mine don't drink and live an hour away from me. \n\nYou're not paying rent and you admitted that they rarely get this opportunity to go out with friends, you really *should* have accepted. It's a good thing they were able to get your sister's boyfriend to drive. If I were them, I'd at least make you start paying rent, if not kick you out altogether, since you obviously don't feel any obligation to them as their family member, or even as a friend. \n\nYou should have taken a nap, drank some coffee, and helped out your family.", "Was it Father\u2019s Day weekend? If so yes YTA for not doing them a favor.", "YTA IMO.  You're living rent free in their home & they asked for a favor.  You make it work.  This is the give & take of families.", "YTA. Older people have the right to go out, too. Did you never ask them to pick you up on some occassion?  You wouldn't have needed to actually stay up, just raise the volume of your phone, go to sleep and let them call you. If you have a smartwatch, set it to vibe and that's it. You could've managed this with minimal sacrifice, but you wanted to school your own parents.", "I\u2019m waffling between n a h and e s h. Are you obligated to drive your parents around? No, but it would be the nice thing to do. And it sounds like you were at the end of your week of 6am shifts? So you didn\u2019t have a time you had to get up the next day?\n\nYour parents shouldn\u2019t hold stuff like this over your head though. Either they are fine with you still living at home while you finish your studies, or they need to tell you they aren\u2019t. It shouldn\u2019t be used to manipulate you to get their way.", "Entitled selfish ungrateful YTA", "Honestly? YTA. It\u2019s called being nice and helping others. I\u2019m sure they\u2019ve helped you plenty over the years.", "Perfectly said", "Yes, step up and do your parents a favor. I really don't understand how people with  decent parents can behave so horribly and stingy towards them. It just breaks my heart to even imagine doing something like that to my parents because I loved them. OP seems to think of his relationship with them as transactional. So YTA.", "I swear redditors like you are so irritating with stuff like this. When you are part of a family, friend group, or even a fucking relationship you sometimes gotta do stuff you don\u2019t want to. There\u2019s nothing wrong with parents expecting their children to do small favors for each other. \n\nYou think I enjoyed picking up my drunk uncle at 2 in the morning? Nah but it\u2019s family and I care. You think I wanna go and listen to my girlfriend and her friends talk about the kardashian show? Fuck no but she wants me there and I care about her. \n\nOr how about when a friend needs help moving and can\u2019t afford to pay you for it. Don\u2019t worry bro I got you. Relationships of any kind are a two way street that requires giving and receiving."]}
