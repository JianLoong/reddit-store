Also, no is a perfectly valid answer and they should have accepted your answer and worked to find another option (which they apparently did). This will sound petty, but perhaps from now on you should find someplace to stay that isn't your parents house. Maybe stay where your college is (in other words, get an apartment there even if it's a cheap efficiency) except for one week (or a couple of days) per break (i.e winter/Christmas and summer) when you would then go back to your parents town and visit, but stay at a motel/hotel during that week so as not to \"burden\" them with your presence in the house. After all, if they expect you to \"pay them back\" by catering to their every need then they should expect that you will remove yourself from that situation. And if they choose to passive aggressively ignore you, turn it back on them. When they complain, point out that they decided that they didn't want to interact with you, so you made it easier on them to not interact by not trying to do so with them. They are seeking for you to basically come crawling on your knees begging forgiveness for not catering to them at which point they will magnanimously forgive you and basically say all is normal now (until they pull this again in a week's time...).", "If you had to work again in the morning then NTA. However, if you didn't then ask yourself how much do they do for me and how much have they done for me in the past? How many rides did they give me growing up that they probably didn't want to do?

It's not unreasonable for them to ask, but perfectly reasonable for you to refuse.\n\nIf you're living there full-time and they want you to contribute to the house, that's a separate issue and you should be prepared to pitch in financially.

I get that they don't get to hang out with friends often, but they chose to have kids that needed their support and attention for 18+ years, which is an OBLIGATION THEY FUCKING CHOSE! They asked a favor of you that would've shifted your sleep schedule and left you sleep deprived. It's not a good combination when transporting drunks.\n\nWhat bothered me even more was all the commenter acting like you aren't allowed to say no and have boundaries. In all honestly, you had a reasonable boundary, and your parents chose to be flippant because \"how dare you make choice with your best interest in mind. What about your parents? They deserve a child that will do as they say when they say.

This is why God created Uber/Lyft. They should be proud of you for working hard and being responsible, not shaming and guilting you for not playing 24 hour cabbie to a bunch of middle aged booze hounds. They\u2019ll get over it.", "NTA. I am a Midwesterner from a small town with no cab services, and this is a really tough position for you. \n\nBeing the DD should not be expected when you aren't even present at the event or if it's late at night when you're normally sleeping. When I would go out with friends being the DD, we would meet up with other friend groups, and suddenly, people expected me to do several trips back and forth to pick up groups 2, 3, etc. It was unreasonable to suddenly be 10 peoples' sober cab, which often happens in small towns. I stayed out later than I actually wanted to because my friends wanted to bar close, or I'd have to wrangle  up people to go the car. Being the DD makes you suddenly responsible for everyone. I am a drinker, so I've seen and been on both sides. \n\nIt's unreasonable for people to say, \"You could have just woken up and got them.\" Nope, when you're already sleeping, you might not wake up to the call, or you might be groggy behind the wheel. You aren't their on call ride.\n\nYour parents are helping you out and asking you for a ride to work, an appointment, or the airport is understandable. But asking you for a ride at an uncertain time from a drinking event is not your problem at 19, especially at 12/ 1 a.m.. I assume they have lived there long enough to figure out other ride alternatives... Trading DD responsibilities with friends, walking, camping, or sleeping in the car. Most Midwestern festivals allow camping or sleeping in your car. It is not uncommon. And I've had friends walk 30/ 40 minutes when there is no ride available. It isn't wintertime.\n\nMost parents I know would never think to ask their 19 year old for a ride at 1 a.m. unless it was an emergency.", ">So I told them no again, and said that they can\u2019t expect me to stay up late just because they want to drink.\n\nThey could also tell you \"You can't expect to live rent-free and not help with the house cleaning and not give us a lift every now and again when we ask\"\n\nYou're being selfish plain and simple.", "Massively entitled YTA. They pay the bills and give you a free roof over your head. Return some favours to them sometimes.", "NTA you are not obliged to ANYTHING after that \"sparkly\" comment of your father... Btw you should've told your sister's brother not to go either... Let them get an Uber or a cab... that's manipulation and it shows...", "YTA. you really couldn't do your parents a favor for a 1 night thing? It's not like they need a ride every weekend and you know Ubers aren't a thing in your area. I bet DWIs are though.", "YTA.  Sleep a few hours, go pick them up, and then go back to bed.  Your sense of entitlement is through the roof.", "YTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\n Since the day you were born your parents have been watching over you, making sure you were safe because they as your parents were responsible for you, but I bet they went well out of the parentally required things and went the extra effort for you....would it kill you to return the favor? So what if they want to drink, they are responsible enough and safe enough to say hey we might drink and it would be better if we didn't drive, please be our ride. But that is too much to ask? Ya I've worked long hard shifts too, back to back. If one of my loved ones asked me for a ride knowing they might drink and didn't want to be unsafe hell yes I would say yes.  \n\n\nI live in the same country as he does and I've never heard it called a sober-cab, everyone has always asked me hey Far can you be my DD? My now 18 year old niece is tickled pink that I am her on-demand 'uber' because of an agreement I made with my sister. I don't ever want her to feel she is stuck somewhere and would make poor choices like driving after drinking, sometimes she uses it. She knows no matter what time of day, call me. I will make sure she gets home safely, no questions asked. I don't ask for gas money I just want her to be safe, she doesn't abuse it. She constantly tells me thank you for being my guardian angel.  \n\n\nIt's about respect and being safe.", "Yeah YTA your living there rent free and I\u2019m sure they drove you around plenty when you were a kid.

I know we do it and that's the culture but it's just not.\nB) Surely they knew they wanted to go to this festival, or might want to go to this festival long before they asked you. If they had asked, you could have asked for a shift change at work to accommodate that, or they could have had more time to ask people, or could go home with one of their friends for the evening if you couldn't get work to do a shift change, or nobody said yes to driving.\n\nYes giving them the ride would have been the nice thing to do but with no opportunities to safely take a nap and make sure you're up in time it's a little unreasonable to expect you to say yes on the short notice.", "NTA... you're the _adult_ here. They should organise better and not demand.\n\nThose stating \"YTA\" etc... you clearly don't work or work hard enough to need a rest.\n\nIf you drop things on people at the last minute and it requires them to massively deviate from their plans to sleep, it better be important.", "NTA\n\nWhat you've done is fair I'd say.\nIt's just a sad situation that you wouldn't want to go pick them up.\nI like to think I'd do anything for my parents/family. I know they would do the same for me. \nI'm sorry you didn't get a family like mine.", "Until you mentioned the shifts I was leaning a little bit - on account of doing your **own** chores is fine but part of sharing a house with people who don't charge you rent, is also doing some chores for the house in general.\n\nHowever, I wouldn't enjoy being driven by someone who is as tired as I presume you were, and it is fair to need sleep after that.", "NTA. 1 AM after multiple early shifts is irresponsible and dangerous. I wonder how the comment section would look if you had crashed? You made the right call, and there\u2019s a lot of adults who think apparently that it\u2019s \u201cdisrespectful\u201d to make a decision that was safer for you and your parents. I think a lot of people are seeing the \u201crent free\u201d and \u201cdrinking\u201d part and making a lot of assumptions. In my area, it\u2019s very common for young adults to live rent free at their parent\u2019s house over the summer in college. If you\u2019re already 1000s in debt, why screw over your kids more?", "YTA\n\nThey asked you for a single favor for a special event. Yeah, it would have cost you some sleep but they've probably lost a ton of sleep because of you.", "NTA. They\u2019re adults, they can figure it out for themselves.", "I think I\u2019m gonna go with ESH on this.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong there\u2019s nothing wrong with you needing sleep, but you didn\u2019t have plans the next day. There was definitely a solution to this. You could\u2019ve still slept for 3-4 hours but put an alarm on, picked them up and gone back to sleep when you were home. I\u2019ve done it plenty of times for my brother and my friends whenever they\u2019ve needed a lift. If my parents ever asked I\u2019d do the same for them too. Only times I\u2019ve ever said no is if I\u2019m already out and won\u2019t be sober or have to be up early for work.\n\nI\u2019d say your parents only suck because they kept pushing the matter and they\u2019re being passive aggressive about the fact you said no. They found another person who was happy to do the lift so that should\u2019ve been the end of it really. No need to drag it out.\n\nAlso on another note, who calls it sober-cab? Don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever heard of that term before? Have always heard people say they\u2019re giving someone a lift, picking them up, acting as designated driver, etc. that one is new to me.", ">There are plenty of cabs out there or uber, it's not hard.\n\nAccording to OP, it's a small town about half an hour away from anything larger. So cabs and ubers would be difficult to get.", "Why does he have to stay up 4 extra hours? Here's an idea, why not get some sleep between say 21.00 and 23.30?  I've done this plenty of times when I have a late night drive.\n\nI hate to break this to everyone saying NTA, as you get older you start doing things at increasingly unsocial hours.  Picking up kids from parties, getting up early to catch a 4am flight for work, soothing a crying baby multie times a night. \n\nThis doesn't read as an unreasonable request from parents, it reads like an ungrateful lazy child trying to find excuses to avoid doing something he simply doesn't want to.  A normal well balanced functioning adult will try to find ways to help, not slope out of it.", "But he can just set an alarm, get a couple of hours sleep, wake up, pick up the parents and then go back to sleep.\n\nMy parents used to do that for me, when I was 16-19. They didn't want their kids riding her bike home in the dark over rural roads, so they would pick me (and my friends) up at a designated time. Sometimes that was 3 am. Usually someone else's parents dropped us off. Those other parents must have thought they were getting the best deal ever. Not having to get up in the middle of the night and not having a bunch of moody teen girls in the house on a weekend morning.\n\nThey did the same thing for brother and his friends. \n\nSo I'd do this for my parents, but that's partly because they did it for me.", "Im from the US, from the midwest specifically, and I have lived in three different states in the midwest and I have never heard the term \"sober-cab\" in my life. Everyone calls it DDing. OP is just weird and also apparently an asshole.", "If in the US, they are underage. So what if they are or aren\u2019t, it\u2019s not like they\u2019re 39 and living at home for free. You\u2019re a pretty shitty failure of a parent if you expect your 19 (TEEN) year old child to pay rent, which it doesn\u2019t sound like they are. Grown up fun requires taking grown up responsibility for your own good time, not harassing your kid who works at 6AM and is a student to be your backup chauffeur.", "This right here. OP you just have to communicate about your needs and leave your judgement about alcohol consumption out of it\n\nIf that's what you did NTA, otherwise kinda YTA imo\n\nHowever the only truly shocking part in here imo are all the comments about how infinitely generous OP's parents are because they... let their own teenage son live with them \"for free\" (OP at least buys and make his own food) instead of kicking him out or making him pay rent?? I pity y'all kids", ">OP, your parents are ADULTS\n\nSo is OP\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>If they want to go out and get drunk with their friends, they need to take the initiative to call a cab or have someone drive back them back home as a DD\n\nThey did, and they found someone who's not a jerk\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>When both you and your parents have calm down, you make this clear and tell them that you're not their chauffeur or DD.\n\nThat is already very clear. It's also very clear that OP is not someone who they can even ask a favor of because he's an AH", "There\u2019s a huge difference between doing the bare minimum for a child and picking your parents up, drunk at one in the morning. OP states that he had worked multiple early shifts in a row, he\u2019s not saying he wouldn\u2019t pick up groceries or drop them off at the doctor. He told them the reason was because of the time, not the driving itself. If a parent told their kid that they couldn\u2019t go to a party because it ended late, that would be a resounding NTA, so why doesn\u2019t that respect go both ways? It has nothing to do with paying rent, it\u2019s respecting that your child is tired and maybe having an exhausted 19 y/o drive around at 1 am isn\u2019t a phenomenal idea anyway", "Well it's not like OP asked to be born. That the parents missed nights out is kinda their fault. Don't get a child if you don't want to provide for it. And just because someone isn't underaged it doesn't mean the parents aren't responsible for their child anymore. Even if for some messed up reason it's not legally required anymore you can't think that a kid turns 18 and suddenly is on their own. That should be obvious. OP is a college student and works part time. He provides his own food. I don't think that there is much money left to pay rent. Maybe a little but if the parents never asked for it it's their problem.\nAlso work is kinda more important than picking up somone. People need sleep. It would be dangerous if he couldn't sleep again and than drives at night. They could get into an accident and die.", "So OP should be thankful for the bare minimum is what you're saying? Because all you summed up is the bare minimum for raising a kid. Should we give the parents a round applause too or would that be too much?\n\nYou're right, OP doesn't mention how his relationship with her parents is. So why do you jump to that it will probably a good one? A genuine question to be honest.", "OP could have just taken a nap when they got home, so they were rested before picking up their parents. They didn\u2019t have to stay up all night waiting.", "At 1 AM? My parents never once picked me up that late, and I have amazing parents. They would have if it was an emergency, but for me, if i was out that late, it was my problem getting home once I could drive", "Exactly right.", "Can't believe how far I had to scroll to find this answer.  Thank you for being a reasonable person.", ">Your parents chose to go out drinking and it is their responsibility to find a safe way home.\n\nLike asking their adult son to drive for them. \n\n>Driving them is a kind gesture not an obligation and you are more than entitled to refuse.\n\nRight, the OP isn't obliged. They are being asked to do something nice by their parents and cannot do a single kind gesture because it's mildly inconvenient. This is called behind an asshole.", "Just want to mention, not everybody it able to sleep in even if they want to. I can't sleep longer than 7-8 am, even if I go to sleep really late.", "OP's not working the next day. He's come off those 6am shifts and wants to go to bed early. But is off the next day", "\\>checked you didn't ask to be born<   \n\n\nahh. so that mean what?  OP can take them self out the game if they didnt want to be born \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f seems regardless of \"asking\" they are quiet enjoying the gift of life. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nalso, they were the fasted sperm. so they did ask for it", "Can\u2019t one book in advance for such circumstances; this is definitely a thing in rural UK.\n\nEdit: NTA!", "Here\u2019s an idea. One of the parents can stay sober. It\u2019s called Designated Driver.", "Hi, just some info, the bot counts votes for a post based on how they are written. If you don\u2019t want to vote you need to space out your text, for exemple : N T A or Y T A. You actually voted N T A for this post.", "19.     \n\n\n its weird you Americans class 19 as underage, not let them drink all while letting them go fight for your country. old enough to join the army, old enough to be treated as an adult.", "Wow, he is a kid?\n\nI thought he was a young adult going off to college.\n\nI didn't know colleges had kids.\n\nI wonder if this kid is allowed to have parties or go out late at night.\n\nProbably not because he is a KID.\n\nHe is either a kid who can't be expected to drive his parents anywhere.\n\nOr he is a young adult who needs to step up when his generous parents ask for a favour.", "\\>Well it's not like OP asked to be born. <   \n\n\nwell. yeah they did. OP swam the fastest to the egg. they wanted it more than thousands of others.   \n\n\nits also just dumb. OP is clearly enjoying life, regardless of asking for it. if they were not the can check out for free any time.", "So we're now lowering the bar to simply not kicking a kid out at 18? I'm sorry for the people you know who were treated that way, but that is not acceptable behavior from anyone who claims to be a half decent parent.", "No it\u2019s called being a Family \nThey\u2019ve help you now it\u2019s time to return the favor", "Yup! A lot of parents telling on themselves in these comments", "Hahahahahahhahahahaha, can\u2019t wait for your turn !!! \nHahahahababnabasbsn", "Right !", "Driving tired has been proven to be as or even more dangerous than drinking and driving. One time I was extremely tired ( had just worked 15 hours) and drove home and swore I would never again because it scared the absolute fuck out of me", "You don\u2019t get why it had to be you??\n\nReally? Could it be because you LIVE THERE (rent free might I add). And so, it just be driving them home, to the place you ALL live. Whereas, sisters boyfriend has to drive from wherever he stays, pick up your parents, drive them to THEIR home, then drive back to his place\u2026..", "Same, but it's not a daily occurrence, OP could have stepped up for this one time thingie", "Parents don\u2019t get to \u201cguilt\u201d a kid into being a taxi at 1am by using rent as a weapon. \n\nI believe in kids paying rent. But I don\u2019t believe in weaponsing things like that", "I would feel majorly inconvenienced by the request, and yet I\u2019d still say yes. I guess we don\u2019t know OPs relationship with their parents, but damn. It\u2019s really not that hard to help your parents who are helping you out, especially knowing there aren\u2019t many other options", "This isn't how the bot works. It just checks what the highest voted comment is.", "Yeah and being family means you let your kid sleep who had to get up really early and figure something else out.", "Oh, oh, but OP needs to risk their life for their parents\u2019 party because they aren\u2019t paying rent!! /S", "Lack of sleep has a similar effect on the brain as being drunk.
