Absolutely NTA.\n\nI have kids of both your and the boys age and while a 13 year old is pretty self sufficient, its not like you can ditch out on him at Universal. He'd still need to stay with you and your cousin. Qutie frankly, 13 year olds are just weird to older teens because, as much as a 13 year old doesn't want to admit it, there is still a lot of little kid left in them. That's why he does and says weird stuff. He's reading social situations and social cues like a 13 year old instead of a 17 year old. \n\nThat trip to Universal is not cheap and it was supposed to be a fun time for you and your cousin to hang out and go on all the rides together. A third person will change that dynamic. Especially a 3rd person you barely know who is  a young kid.\n\nTell your mother you will not be doing it. You and your cousin will make other plans and her friend's 7th grader is not welcome to come with you. You are not going to babysit him. Your Mother is WAY out of line here. It sounds like she is embarassed to go back to her friend to rescind the offer. Instead, maybe she can tell her friend that your plans with your cousin have changed and you won't be going at this point.", "Since you would be \"babysitting\" him,  ask how much you'll be paid per hour.  That might change their minds", "There is no way that your Mom could be so clueless as to think 2 seventeen year old girls would welcome a much much younger boy cousin.\n\nNTA", "NTA. Just don\u2019t go. Definitely sucks. But none of this is your problem. This is on your mom not you.", "NTA. Even the nicest 13-year-old in the world is not going to be welcome on a trip two 17-year-olds planned! And it\u2019s your school break! You\u2019re old enough to be able to plan that and enjoy yourselves, and your mom is old enough to say \u201cwhoops I messed up, the girls actually can\u2019t take him sorry\u201d to his mom.", "Why doesn't your mom just call and say \"hey sorry, I overstepped myself, the girls were really just wanting to have a day together and I didn't even bother to ask them.\"\n\nA good parent would simply fall on the sword here and say it was my bad, sorry, but unfortunately OP has parents who would rather save face for themselves than deal with a mildly awkward conversation with a sibling.\n\nSheesh, unlucky OP.\n\nDefinitely NTA.", "Why on earth would your mom want two minors to take a third, much younger minor, on a road trip? You're not even old enough to make medical decisions on his behalf! NTA, and it was very rude of you mom to make the offer.", "NTA- Not your responsibility, plus amusement rides are often based around pairs of riders. Does your mom expect one of you to ride alone so you can keep an eye on him? Your mom can take him if she wants or call his mom and say she misunderstood the plan.", "NTA she signed u up to babysit against tour will , i wouldn\u2019t want to go either", "It was a typo I meant to put comes", "NTA. A group of 3 is awkward at an amusement park and mom is trying to saddle you with a virtual stranger. I guess mom is going to Universal. She invited him, not you. Why would she expect you to be responsible for a young teen? Very rude on mom's part. I wouldn't go either.", "No, you have more than\u201d hope he says no\u201d reschedule for a day or two before you were supposed to go, if possible. You and your cousin get time together without a tag along! Then Tell your parents you canceled. NTA. Your mom has the audacity to invite a weird kid on your trip and then accuse you of being selfish? She\u2019s the selfish one- she only did it to score points with her friend.", "NTA pretty inappropriate of your mom to do.", "NTA\nIt is unfair of your mother to volunteer you to take a tween you don't know to an amusement park alone. It would be different if she and his parent(s) were going to be there too. It is beyond me that she would think you'd be ok with that scenario. Even you did know him better, it doesn't sound like a good idea to put teens in charge of tweens without any adult supervision.", "NTA\n\nAnd you do not have to only hope he says no. Your mother had no business inviting him and she needs to go back to her cousin and explain you are not comfortable supervising a child. This is on her. \n\nSelfish and disrespectful is volunteering someone else to so something to make you look good without asking first.", "NTA.", "NTA. \n\nAlso, holy shit that title had me confused. \n\nAnyway, you are being completely pragmatic here. I get how it could be fun for him if you guys had an existing relationship. But it doesn't sound like that's there. Not to mention, being responsive for a 12yo in an amusement park is a nightmare mare, there's people everywhere and so easy to get lost in the crowd when you stand chest height; any rides are inherently dangerous, and so on. My point is *this* is not the type of thing that I feel should be thrust upon someone who doesn't feel up to the task. It's just a lot. IMHO", "NTA Stand your ground, reiterate you will not go if he is going regardless of if he says yes or not. You weren't asked about your trip, you set the conditions for you going, not them. They will deal with the family, it was their fault after all. They will have to back down in the end, just be a rock. Repercussions will blow over, and your parents might learn a lesson in respect.", "Nta", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYOur mom is an AH to invite others to YOUR trip. You are handling your AH mom well.", "NTA, what 17 yo girls want to walk around with a 12 yo? It would be different if she invited him on a trip she also planned to attend", "NTA", "\"My mother does not speak for me and does not get to volunteer my company. It would be inappropriate for him to come on a trip for older girls. It's unfortunate if he's disappointed, perhaps my mother can make it up to him somehow.\"\n\nNote that this does not include an apology (bc OP did nothing wrong) and squarely puts any blame where it belongs, on Mom.", "It's not just babysitting, Mom needs to learn she cannot volunteer her daughter. \n\nSome people love volunteering the time of others. They get the nice warm feeling of having given something without doing a lick of work themselves. Such people need to be cut off at the knees at the earliest opportunity.", "That's the best solution actually. If the kid has already been told your mum will have to take the kid as its not fair on him that your mum was being weird. But also not fair that you should have to take him. Nta"]}
