He can still be friends and have him over to play video games.\n\nBut he's gotta find his own place to bang his \"girlfriends\".\n\nIf your BF was also single and they wanted to live the bachelor life together that's fine. Your BF wants the best of both worlds. You're not a frolicking drinking bachelor. You're his female SO, and this arrangement is quite disrespectful to you, honestly.\n\nDemand better.", "NTA  \nYou should not be expected to supply all the toiletries for him & his hookups. Get a shower caddy so you can easily bring your supplies in & out of the bathroom as needed. For the more general purpose items: Dishwashing liquid, Paper towels, toilet paper etc. You would not be wrong to remove them but it might cause more of a problem & a physical mess if you don't. I fear to think what he might do or use. However as someone else mentioned the dollar store bargain brands are a good idea.If you have any way to find that commercial interfolded sheet toilet paper that would probably convince him to buy some - that stuff is nasty - like sandpaper - lol. (maybe staples)  \n\n\nSide Story: when I was in college the college decided to save money by replacing all the rolled toilet paper in the dorms with the little single sheet stuff. We started buying our own TP & this led to the great toilet paper revolt - lol.  Complaints were made, petitions were signed, parents threatened administrators, the little sheets were dumped in administration offices. The great Toilet paper revolt was the headline of the campus paper for quite a few issues and in the end we did get real toilet paper back - lol.", "NTA what\u2019s the alternative continue letting him take advantage? What a shit roommate.", "Leave 1 bar of Lava in there. \ud83d\ude08", "It doesn\u2019t seem like much but it add ups when the products I like to purchase myself are all $10+ per bottle. I afford myself very few luxuries, but better quality body products is one of the things I do prefer and enjoy, and I don\u2019t pay for them with sharing in mind!", "That\u2019s how I feel! I can\u2019t prove they are using my stuff but I\u2019ve never seen any of these girls bring stuff with them. They come in the clothes they sleep in and leave in the next day with the same stuff, and his room is gross so I know these girls must want to wash afterwards.", "Thank you lol", "He will get his own stuff as long as there is a lock on your bedroom door and your boyfriend holds his ground. You may need to reinforce the bedroom lock NY getting a lock box in your bedroom to really drive the point home.", "Guys like that don't take hints. They require that you say it out loud, multiple times, in short words they can understand. Then they get mad at you for talking about it. Be aware, this will likely escalate.", "I had to ask a friend,  he said add a pair Home test  for chlamydia and gonorrhoea  too, because that what he did to his  room mate  Sir Shag-Alot.   After few weeks and some used test   Sir  Shag-Alot became  Monk Shag-Not.", "yeah exactly, I can usually get almost a Years worth of use out of $20 in soap, my cousins routinely hit that every month, because they get those luxury brands, while I get those huge 2L bottles from Costco or those Axe products when they're on sale for $2CAD", "I\u2019m hoping moving it to my\nbedroom and telling my\nboyfriend not to be nice will be enough for now.", "I am fully prepared for an escalation, just not sure if my partner is lol.", "Every home has one!", "I've since seen that your boyfriend doesn't view his friend the same way, so that is good.", "Guy friend groups always have a total AH in them. I think it's to remind the other guys' gfs that dating is worse.", "oh yeah, their relationship has really shifted and I think us moving will be necessary if they want to keep their friendship alive after this.", "Get a chalkboard and hang it by the door, make a new tick mark when a new one shows up. LOL", "I may be a little more petty\u2026 but whenever he brought a new girl over I\u2019d say \u201cDamn Another one?!?!? How many different chicks have stayed this week?!?\u201d nice and loudly \ud83e\udd23 NTA", "NTA it is very common with bad roommates to have bathroom stuff in a caddy you can take to and from the bathroom, locks on your food cupboards and a second fridge with locks on it and to even hide the your saucepans and plates etc. It can also be so bad to need locks on closets and room safes. My son has had some bad experiences with room mates and I've heard so many tales from my kids friends experiences in shared accommodation.  It can cost a lot of money to constantly replace products and food. It is not petty it is survival from people who will not stop taking advantage. It sounds like your bf is being a doormat.", "NTA. He needs to go. It is such a terrible idea to have all these random people in your house. You could get bedbugs or things could get stolen. Hard pass.", "This cracked me up, my roommate is the sister for sure. Doesn\u2019t care that it\u2019s not his, but cares once it\u2019s gone.", "Especially when it\u2019s body wash or toilet paper.", "i\u2019m thankful that my partner has picked my side in this, i know it could have gone worse!", "I\u2019m stockpiling the suggestions in this response section, you guys are so good \ud83d\ude02", "When we moved in, we agreed everything would be split 3 ways, including supplies. Guess that went out the door lol.", "We were supposed to rotate between the 3 of us, but only 2 of us ever buy stuff", "That\u2019s what it is and I didn\u2019t realize til your comment! he\u2019s just very entitled about things. thanks for your judgment and well wishes \ud83d\udc95", "Is it appropriate to tell him to have his hook ups bring toiletries lmao?", "It was just convenient and financially smart at the time, now we scroll through one bedrooms and are definitely regretting the decision.", "We are already in the process of finding a one bedroom for when it\u2019s financially possible, we know this is not working and we both hate it. He realizes that in order to keep this friendship alive, we cannot live with current roommate. My partner and I just didn\u2019t realize he was this much of an alcoholic and this obnoxious until it was too late.", "I have thought about it but I really don\u2019t want to go buy more shit for him to use, ya know. He can be gross if he wants to in his room, but the rest of my space will stay clean.", "He has such a hard time putting his foot down and telling people no. I feel for him, but i feel worse for our pockets. We moved in with this man to help budget with rent and now i\u2019m just replacing it in house supplies.", "That\u2019s my concern. We moved any nice electronics out of accessible areas as well bc I don\u2019t want shit getting stolen.", "Yeah if they\u2019re not packing overnight bags (and even then people still don\u2019t pack that stuff because they expect it to be wherever they\u2019re going) they\u2019re using yours. You should remind your boyfriend of the fact that your products specifically are way more expensive than he realizes, just for some random girls to use and thats not fair for you to be losing hundreds of dollars worth of product. Stay strong OP! and even if your husband breaks make sure he\u2019s only sharing his soap NOT your stuff in fact I\u2019d hide it even from him if you really think he\u2019s likely to crack with his friend.", "link me to it!", "Don\u2019t beat yourself up about it too much - you made the best decision you could at the time with the information you had. Some stuff you never discover until after.\n\nI too had a friend who turned out to be an *awful* roommate - to the point it broke the friendship. (It didn\u2019t help that she lied to make herself look good, saying she was quiet and always cleaned up after herself. She was neither lol)", "I have made it clear our stuff is doesn\u2019t leave the room unless it\u2019s me or him using it and he seems fine with that, so my fingers are crossed for now.", "Yeah we\u2019ve had conversations about his drinking and stuff and nothing changes, I\u2019m hoping we can get out before it completely wrecks my partners friendship bc I know he loves the guy.", "Good luck I hope it works out until you guys move out! I\u2019d be going crazy if I were in your position.", "We didn\u2019t realize he was so awful til we moved in, my boyfriend is also sick of the behavior, we just can\u2019t responsibly move yet. But I think the only way their friendship can survive (if he wants it to) is if we stop living together.", "Where is mine?", "Oh, i am \ud83d\ude03", "NTA this dude thinks he's living with mommy and daddy again who pay for everything but with no house rules. Can't stand entitled fools like this.", "NTA. Honestly I would have done this after a week \ud83d\ude02 I can\u2019t stand when roommates use anything of mine", "He\u2019s gonna get treated like a squatter til he starts putting up on household essentials", "Squatters get squatter treatment. Fair. Hope you and bf can get away from this bum soon.", "Hope your find your new place soon! Good luck!"]}
