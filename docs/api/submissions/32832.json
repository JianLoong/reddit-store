It took them almost a year but they managed to follow all the rules for two months.\n\nWe have found an acceptable dog at a rescue and we are bringing him home tomorrow.\n\nMy kids are stoked to get a pup for Christmas. My husband has lost a bunch of weight from his daily walks and I have too since I joined in on most walks.\n\nThanks everyone for your comments and opinions.

I already have the dogs. I could get another one...?", "Well done xx", "What a wonderful outcome for all! So glad to read this", "Congrats! Don\u2019t forget the pup tax xd", "I was expecting never to hear from you again! Thank you for proving me wrong!", "pup tax when you can! I love this update \ud83e\udde1", "Good for you, OP. I hope the dog brings joy and only a little bit of chaos (because there's always some). \n\nI loved how you responded to your parents and husband too. You were not an AH. You just knew what they were trying to pull and were having none of it.", "Had your original post bookmarked for almost a year\u2014 glad you stuck to your guns, and glad your family rose to the occasion! Bravo!", "Congratulations op", "Best update ever! \n\nThis is what parents should do! You taught your kids (and husband) so many life lessons!", "Congrats!", "Congratulations !!", "Best outcome you could have hoped for!", "Wonderful! Merry Christmas!", "Come back with pictures!", "This is the greatest outcome I\u2019ve ever seen.

So good to hear everybody's happy this way, and you got some health benefits too!\n\nCan you give us some tips/suggestions on how to persevere in the mile-long walks twice a day, even when the weather's shit?", "YAY!!! Congratulations!!! I'm so happy to see this update for you and your family! All of this is such wonderful news.", "Well done OP for holding strong. \n\nI remember your original post! Woot, woot! Glad you all get a cute dog for Christmas!", "Good for you!  Good job!", "This is amazing! Please make sure you tell kids and hubby how proud of them you are for accomplishing this goal, and that they still need to take out the garbage and go for walks. :)", "What a wonderful update! I love the side benefits of improved health all around and your kids learning to be more mature and responsible in general. Wish I had read your original post and implemented a plan like yours before we got our kittens lol.", "I remember this post !! \n\nI\u2019ll be honest I didn\u2019t think they would pull it off, so glad I was wrong. Awesome. \n\nTo you, especially, but also your brood congratulations and WELL DONE! \ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffd\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffd\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffd\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffd\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffd", "I\u2019m amazed your dogs don\u2019t badger you into that much walking.  Are they teeny or a flat face breed?  Short legs or breathing issues can sometimes mean short walks.\n\nDo you have a yard you let the dogs out in sometimes rather than walking them?\n\nTry removing the gate for a while.  Can\u2019t let the dogs out without a fully fenced yard.  Walk the dogs more.", "Ugh I know that feeling. I love my pup, I don't love walking 3 miles a day. It's just.. boring.\n\nHe goes to dog care when I'm at work and we play in the park a lot. He gets his exercise in .. me on the other hand.", "When my dog and I were younger and less broken, I would take her out with my longboard. She a collie/greyhound mix, so a skateboard was the only way I'd ever be able to go fast enough for her (my buddy paced us once on his motorcycle and we were doing 15km/h in the cool down part of the trip, so i think we would peak at 20-25km/h). We did a 3.3km loop three times a day. I miss those days."]}
