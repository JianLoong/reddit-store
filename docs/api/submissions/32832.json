Short legs or breathing issues can sometimes mean short walks.\n\nDo you have a yard you let the dogs out in sometimes rather than walking them?\n\nTry removing the gate for a while.  Can\u2019t let the dogs out without a fully fenced yard.  Walk the dogs more.", "Ugh I know that feeling. I love my pup, I don't love walking 3 miles a day.

We did a 3.3km loop three times a day. I miss those days.", "FYI, consider the grooming requirements on a non-shedding dogs.

I hope whatever dog yall get that it's a great addition to the family!\n\nSometimes it takes a dog awhile to get used to a new home so while it might seem bad at first just give the pup some time and they should settle in. Especially since everyone seems well prepared for a dog thanks to you!", "This is great. I can't believe people were arguing with you that walks weren't necessary for dogs.

He'd do 15-mile hikes with me without question, and he was mostly a sleepy quiet beagle at home.", "I have to ask- did they only occasionally miss a day and that why it took a year or did they miss several days- I'm thinking caving but setting similar rules", "I was just thinking about the original post the other day!

Lovely to see.", "Good for you guys!  (I'm a dog person.) However, keep in mind, Christmas isn't a great time to get a dog. There's a lot of upheaval, strange things in the house, decorations around, including electrical cords, foods that dogs shouldn't eat, etc. When you get a new dog, you should try to minimize excitement. Which you can still do at Christmas, it's just more difficult. Just start as you mean to go on. Stick to the rules, whatever they're going to be. And make sure the dog has a dedicated dog bed or crate that's someplace quiet or out of the way that they can access whenever they need to. Dogs often get digestive upsets from stress, so make sure the kids--and guests!--understand that the dog is on a strict diet and can't be overfed. Besides, it will probably take the kids a while before they learn what dogs can eat and what they can't. Like grapes--no grapes or raisins for dogs. No chocolate, tomato or onions either. And watch out for too much fat, dogs are very prone to pancreatitis and it can be dangerous.   \n\n\nBest of luck to you and your new addition!", "Well done. We will want pictures", "Congratulations! In the OP one of your requirements was \u201cnon-shedding breed\u201d, and I just wanted to make sure you are aware that non shedding dogs require a lot more grooming than shedding breeds! \n\nI\u2019d say it is a lot less time cleaning either way but to make sure to educate yourself on whatever dog you gets grooming needs are. I really want to drive this home because a lot of people get things like doodles thinking they don\u2019t need extra maintenance and severally neglect their coat maintenance which can cause them a lot of discomfort and pain. Most can be clipped short every month or so in order to remove the need to brush them much, but that can cost a bit of money. \n\nJust wanted to look out for your new pet, and I hope you have a wonderful chunk of years with them!", "Don\u2019t know how much a mile is but I\u2019m glad the walking thing worked out in the end.

When he was a pup with minimal bladder control, he got more frequent shorter walks, but since getting to be 6 months old or so, it\u2019s been 2 walks a day, the first is a bit more than 2 miles in the morning, the evening walk is more like 0.5 - 0.75 miles. I do it every day, unless we\u2019re traveling and he\u2019s boarded, or during truly awful weather - think ice storms / black ice on the streets and sidewalks - when we walk as much as I think is safe. My partner joins us sometimes, but only during good / warm weather, and when they\u2019re not traveling for work. And while I won\u2019t go so far as to say I\u2019m truly \u2018in shape\u2019, I give full credit to the dog for me being in *some* shape, and not being pretty completely sedentary, and possibly saving my life due to his daily walk requirements.", "I'm gonna need context for that.
