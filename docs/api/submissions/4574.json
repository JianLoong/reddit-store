I have a son from a previous relationship, Noah (18m) and he has a daughter from his previous marriage, Grace (17f).\n\nMy husband considers Noah his son and is in all but his name.\n\nNoah is an amazing student, high GPA, plays basketball and football, volunteers for charity and is an all around great person.\n\nNoah has recently received a likely letter from his dream school and we are all ecstatic about it.\n\nMy husband and I started talking about finances and how we are going to contribute towards tuition fees.\n\nI was a single mom until I got married, so I haven\u2019t got much saved but my husband has mentioned the fund he\u2019s been collecting for college since his daughter was born.\n\nNow here\u2019s the part that I\u2019m asking if i\u2019m the Ahole for, but please read the rest of this post before making judgements, I do explain myself.\n\nI asked my husband if we could use that money for Noah, it\u2019s enough for all 4 years of his degree.\n\nHe said no in the beginning but I explained that while I love Grace, she isn\u2019t very academically inclined. Average GPA, no extra curricular\u2019s and has even said that she\u2019s going to the community college close by for the first 2 years.\n\nPlus, she\u2019s a junior, we have a whole year to start building up another college fund for her.\n\nMy husband is still on the fence but at least he\u2019s not sticking with no.\n\nHe wanted to talk to his daughter first and reiterate what I said above.\n\nIt did not go well.\n\nHe said there was screaming involved and included her calling my son and I names that I will not be repeating here. Accusing him of cheating on her mother, which is completely false and she knows it, we met 3 years ago, 7 months after his divorce.\n\nI\u2019ve been getting a barrage of texts and voicemails from his ex-wife\u2019s side of the family, calling me all sorts of names.\n\nMy husband is disgusted with his daughters words and actions and is pretty upset and down right now.\n\nI feel like I\u2019ve caused this but my mother, sister and aunt are telling me that I did the right thing. That my son deserves that money.\n\nI heard about this sub and wanted to get an unbiased opinion.\n\nAITA for asking my husband to pay for our son\u2019s tuition?\n\nI was asked by mods to say why I believe I may be the arsehole: Because all of his daughters and ex wives family is saying that I am and I can see how upset my husband is, I can't help but think I may have caused it.", "created_utc": 1670878256, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zkb1g9/aita_for_asking_my_husband_to_pay_for_our_sons/", "score": 98, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Whichever way you look at it, YTA. And anyone who tells you different (aka your side of the family) is an a-hole too. \n\nThat's Grace's fund, not your son's. Quit it with the entitlement. \n\nAnd if your son is as academically and athletically gifted as you say he is, then he should be able to get some scholarships. Getting a part time job is also an option. As is getting financial aid. Your lack of planning and saving is on you. Grace shouldn't have to pay for it. Being a single mother is no excuse. \n\nAlso, your hubby spent close to 2 decades saving up for that fund. And your plan is to use it and then make up for it in a year?!? And not even just use it for a year while you save up for the next three years (still an a-hole move but to a lesser extent). But no. You want the whole lot. The entitlement is really strong with you! Your son is not entitled to Grace's money. Whatever you think about her academic abilities. You denigrating them and her extracurriculars or lack thereof does not give you a pass to steal her college fund. And yes, steal coz that's what you would be doing. \n\n\nEdited.\n\nEdit 2: And since they are super okay with you taking money that's not yours, instead of you stealing Grace's money, why don't you have your relatives (mother, sister and aunt) contribute to \"Saint\" Noah's college fund?\n\nEdit 3: YTA for the \"our son\" but \"his daughter\" bit.", "YTA. You say your husband considers Noah as his own son, but you don't say that you see Grace as a daughter in the same way (the way she spoke to her father indicates even if you have the feeling it's not mutual). You are full of praise for Noah but the kindest thing you say about Grace isn't even a kind thing, it's something you think Noah can benefit from. If you've been open about your praise for him in the home then that could feed into the bitterness Grace demonstrated.\n\nActually, what are your and Noah's relationship with Grace typically like? Has the blended family experience been a bumpy one?", "Wow YTA. \n\n\"So, new husband of 2 years. Your daughter is kind of an idiot, so I think that you should give my perfect son her college fund that you've been saving for, since she was a baby (presumably), with your ex wife\"\n\nHow are you justifying that to yourself??", "YTA. Our son....his daughter. 'Nuff said about your morals and ethics.", "YTA - why would you think he deserves the money ?? And who are you to say she\u2019s a average student so she\u2019s not as deserving ?? You\u2019re out of line 100%. Take out a loan for your kid, if he\u2019s so smart he can apply for scholarships. What you don\u2019t do is take away her savings. And if he agrees with you he\u2019s an even bigger AH whose daughter will never forgive him.", "YTA.

I mean, I *could* also go into the fact that Grace having fewer scholarship options available means she\u2019ll need *more* family support, not less, or simply that it\u2019s *her money* and you shouldn\u2019t expect it to be reallocated just because that would make life easier for you\u2026but if you *really* said that with a straight face, I kinda feel like in-depth explanations are a waste of time.", "See ya in r/amithedevil\n\nYTA", "YTA Don't steal her money", "YTA - your husband should be disgusted by your words and actions.

You married a man over 20 years older than you who got you a job at his company (cough nepotism cough). \n\nYou say you love Grace. But not enough for her to get a college education? Because your son deserves one more? \n\nYTA YTA YTA \n\nWhy don\u2019t you ask your sperm donor and your family to help out if they\u2019re so concerned?", "Yes YTA.

You crossed a line here and do not realize it.", "Your son does not deserve the money-", "YTA, you didn't contribute to the fund so why would your son be entitled to it?

There's nothing wrong with using the programs available to lessen the cost of school.", ">\" That my son deserves that money.\"\n\nYTA for that statement alone.\n\nThat fund was set aside for his daughter.  He's had it since his daughter was born - so for years when he was still married to his ex.  So his ex wife (who has no connection to your son) and his ex-wife's family (who has no connection to your son) probably threw a couple bucks in there at some point.  Or helped out husband so that he was able to save money somewhere else and use that saved money to build up the fund.  It's not just his money in there.  It's their money too.  And your son does not deserve a dime from them.\n\nTell your mother, and your sister, and your aunt, to open up their wallets.  \n\n\nEDIT:  The way you use \"Our son\" and \"his daughter\" is something to reflect on too.", "YTA the money belongs to your stepdaughter for college your son does not deserve that money not ment for him. You and your extended family want him to go to college then you all should take loans out. My daughter could barely get through high-school, she went on to college and for 4 years she made the deans list. Never judge a book by its cover.", "YTA.

Your son deserves the money you have saved for him\u2026 nothing!", "YTA, duh.\n\nIf your son is soo perfect, I'm sure scholarship won't be a problem, instead of stealing money which was saved for Grace since she was a baby.\n\nAnd I feel bad for Grace, because you don't seem like you care or even like her.", "YTA. That money is HERS as it was set aside exclusively for her education from the minute she was born. Your inability or unwillingness to save for your son's schooling is not her fault and she should not be punished for it. \n\nHer reaction is highly indicative that this isn't the first time you've usurped something that belonged to her or overstepped your boundaries. \n\nIf you push this, Grace will cut all of you out of her life permanently. If you cost your husband his daughter because of your own entitled attitude, he will end up hating you.", "YTA\n\nyour failure to plan is not stepdaughters responsibility or expense\n\nOf course your family is going to agree to rob Grace to pay for Noah. It costs them nothing. This is nobody's  problem but yours and Noah's.", "YTA I love how OP goes on Reddit to ask and everyone says she is the AH but she tries to shut down every comment. Her mind is set up that she isn't and no one can tell her otherwise. She was looking for justification. Entitlement at its finest. At 36 and you have everyone else even a lot younger than you that see how wrong you very much are.", "Your son does not deserver the money.  \n\nWhy do you say \"all of his daughters\"?  Are there more.", "Yup, sorry OP but YTA here and in a big way.\n\nThe money has been set aside from way before you and Noah were on the scene and it should be used for its original purpose.\n\nYou sound very entitled and need to think about the family dynamic, not just about Noah.", "YTA\n\n100% A H\n\nThat money does not belong to your son. If your kid is that academically inclined. He should get plenty of merit aid and scholarship money.\n\nAlso, until three years ago. MOM was also contributing to HER child\u2019s account. Mom gets a hell of a lot more say in what happens to her/her child\u2019s money than you do.", "YTA what a horrible thing to do to your stepdaughter...your partner is a major AH as well for going along with it.\n\nIt wouldn't have made any difference if your stepdaughter was top of the class...you would have gone after the money anyway.\n\nHope your partner sees through you...and soon before you destroy your stepdaughter", "YTA big time. regardless of how much your husband loves your son, that money has been put into an account for Grace & should be there for her when the time comes. to take that away from her would be a serious hit to her relationship with her dad, not to mention the resentment she'd probably grow to feel over you & your actions.", "You only think you may have cause this?? You are not entitled to his daughters college fund in any way shape or form.

Apologize to your step daughter now if you want any chance or her talking to you again let alone forgiving you for your entitlement YTA", "YTA- your son is not entitled to that money, despite what your mother says. That money is meant for his daughter and her anger is justified. You're trying to take HER MONEY. How would your son feel if you gave away savings ment for him.

You\u2019ve been married two years and your son is just sooo much more than his daughter that he deserves her college money.  Way to drive his daughter away from her father.  But hey the golden biy deserves her college fud, we because she just doesn\u2019t come up to par.\nYou have one hell of a nerve is all \nI can say.  I guess you are badgering the hell of your husband to get your greedy hands on this money.", "YTA. You aren\u2019t entitled to her college fund. Who do you think you are.

Get financial aid like everyone else does", "YTA it\u2019s not his problem or fault that you didn\u2019t start saving for your son\u2019s education sooner.

Yes, *stealing.* Idk why the rest of your family thinks he\u2019s entitled to another kid\u2019s college fund, but he is not. You also have no nice things to say about her! She probably feels like you\u2019re stealing her dad from her and trying to make him view your son as his only child, because honestly, that\u2019s how you come across in this post.\n\nFind alternative ways for the college fund. You don\u2019t talk about other options, you jumped immediately to dipping your hand in another kid\u2019s pot. You two are the adults, and it\u2019s Noah\u2019s fund. Between the three of you, figure it out. And leave Grace *out* of it.", "Your son does NOT deserve your husband's daughter's college fund!!! He started that for her LONG before he met you, and you have NO RIGHT to swoop in with your golden boy and try to steal it.\n\nYTA. Your \"reasons\" are abysmal and insulting to his daughter.\n\nIf your son is so amazing, then he needs to apply for the scholarships and grants that go along with that \"success\".\n\nYes, you caused this rift.

It is hard enough for her to see her father being more of a dad to your son than he has been to her, but to take the money he and hus wife put aside for her is beyond ridiculous (his ex was a SAHM, but that was by agreement and she contributed by taking care of things - half of that fund is her contributions).\n\nYou husband is going to loose his daughter at this rate. That may even be your goal, who knows, but in a few years he will realize what a mistake he made.

Right? \n\nYeah, that what I thought. YTA.", "YTA. This is awful. All of it.", "YTA. \"My son deserves that money.\" Why? Because three years ago, when he was 15, his mother met a man who had spent a lot of time saving money for his daughter? Your attitude is disgraceful.", "YTA. You owe your husband and stepdaughter an apology just for asking. \n\nYou didn\u2019t save for Noah. He will need scholarships, loans, and/or grants. He might have to get a job in addition to school. That is how everyone I know has been able to go to college. Does it suck? YES! But we all did it because our parents couldn\u2019t afford to send us.", "YTA!  That money was put aside for his daughter. \n\nYou have now caused a rift in your husband and his daughters relationship that may never be fixed.\n\nYou sound extremely entitled to your husband of two years money. What you asked for was not okay?  What you did to that relationship is not ok?\n\nI get you were trying to do right by you son, but you went about it the wrong way!!  \n\nYou need to rescind the request and apologize to your husband and his daughter for even asking.  You put your husband in a horrible position.", "YTA\n\nYour husband and presumably his ex-wife put this money aside over 17 years for their daughter. It wasn't contingent on where she went or what her grades were. It was for their daughter.\n\nNow you jump in, 17 years later, and want the money for your son. I don't care if your son is a saint, it's not his money. It's your step-daughter's money. Badmouthing her doesn't change that. Neither does her acting poorly in response to this suggestion--if she really did act that poorly because I'm not sure you're an objective witness in this situation.\n\nNow do some math. How do you expect your husband to come up with 17 years' worth of savings in time for his daughter to start college? And why on earth did this only come up when  he's a senior? How much money have you saved? Are you intending to spend that first? I suspect not.\n\nYTA\n\nTake out a loan for your son. Use the money you do have. Get his father involved if that's possible. Apply for scholarships and financial aid. Don't rob your step-daughter.", "YTA on many levels.  Just because you two are married does not mean you both have to contribute money wise. Besides, what he saved was before you two got together. Technically, thats all his.  \n\n\nBut what really is wrong is how you stated your son is great in GPA and what not, but the daughter isn't, and she doesn't do extracurricular activities, and is thinking about doing a 2 year community college program.  \n\n\nAs a college student, I will state this. My professors grilled this into use our first year to get us down from our high horse. GPA, while great, is not what gets you in all the time. Extracurricular activities too doesn't always get you in. Them two things are brownie points. If a college is in need for students, they'll accept darn near anyone as long as they hit the bare basics (if there is a need for a certain ACT score or GPA score). Just because her chances may be lower does not mean she won't get in. You also stated she is a junior. She has one entire year of thinking before she decides if she wants to pursue a community college or if she wants to do something grander like a university or vet school.  \n\n\nDue to the uncertainty on whether or not she will change her mind, your husband needs every drop of funding to be prepared for that. And once more, that funding is his alone, and he wants it for his daughter. He had several plans for that.   \n\n\nSure, one year to build those those funds up is great and all, but I can almost guarantee that the one year you two make may only pay for half a semester. College is expensive as heck. But since you have to pay 2 semesters of your sons education before she can go to college (if she chooses to), your husband is going to be hurting on trying to ensure she will get to where she needs to be. And that. That ain't fair to her.  \n\n\nIf you want to get funding to pay for your son's education, then start applying for scholarships NOW. Actually you should of done it months ago, but either away, attack every website that offers a scholarship and collect them up. If need be, you can also get a loan too to help his first year. Then after that, you need to talk to your son and tell him that he needs to find a part time job, or better yet an paid internship, to help out with the future bills.  \n\n\nThere is many options to pay the college bills, but that does not mean you need to force your husband to part with the funds he saved for his daughters future.", "YTA. Your husband has known Noah for 3 years or so and you want him to give his daughter\u2019s college fund to him???  Seriously? You and your husband should have discussed college finances (including the implication of the two of you getting married on financial aid availability for Noah)BEFORE you got married. Your husband\u2019s income will now probably be considered in your ability to pay tuition for Noah whereas when you were single only your income would have been considered. With cost of attendance at some private schools in the 80K range, there is no time for significant savings for Noah\u2019s college costs unless you and hubby have extremely high incomes. Plus, you married a man more than 20 years older than you who\u2019s close to retirement age, the plan for paying for your kid\u2019s college is going to require some creativity. He may not be able to retire and pay for Noah\u2019s college.\n\nYou say that Noah got a likely letter. That means that he is one of the college\u2019s most desired students. If it\u2019s a school that gives merit aid, he might be getting some scholarship money. If it\u2019s an Ivy League school it might mean he was a recruited athlete or an academic superstar. In this case, there\u2019s no scholarship money because ivies and some other schools do not give merit aid , only aid based on demonstrated financial need.\n\nIt is definitely an AH move trying to take your stepdaughter\u2019s college fund, no matter what the circumstances. Figure out a way to pay for Noah\u2019s expenses. This may mean he can\u2019t go to his dream school.", "YTA\n\nThere is absolutely nothing wrong with ASKING.\n\nWhere I do have an issue is\n\n>I feel like I\u2019ve caused this but my mother, sister and aunt are telling me that I did the right thing. **That my son deserves that money.**\n\nYour son deserves absolutely $0 from your DIL's education fund.  He's not entitled to a dime of it.  If they had agreed to share, then your son should have felt very appreciative and grateful.  Instead you and your family want him to feel entitled and your DIL to feel like less of a person because of public school grades.", "YTA", "Yta,\nNot because you want to help your son but because or how you talked about your step daughter. Also you can your son his son but homis daughter you don't do the same.", "YTA. Well you clearly don't love Grace like a daughter, and absolutely do not have her best interest at hearth. Great job manipulating her dad to benefit your son though.\n\nGrace is going to need that money. Your son can get scholarships. Your family is very biased and, like you, can't wait for your son to get his hands on someone else's money.", "YTA big time. You need to get off that high horse, already. It's the daughter's money, period. Get your greedy paws off it. If I was hubby, this would be grounds for divorce.", "YTA, that\u2019s his money he saved for his daughter. Regardless of where she goes it was meant for her. Too bad your son wasn\u2019t smart enough to get a full ride since your expectations are so high for the daughter and community college is something you look down upon", ">my son deserves that money\n\nNo, not even a little. YTA", "YTA. Not your money, not  your decision. Also did you basically call his child dumb and he went with it? Of course you caused it. Way to go on relationship building with your step daughter. Also your husband is an asshole in case that wasn't clear.", "YTA  Your son does NOT deserve this money simply because you love him and if he's done so well at school, he should be going after all the scholarships he possibly can.  That money wasn't saved up for you to use.  It was for his daughter, regardless what her grades look like, she'll need that for community college as much as your son does.  She's understandably hurt.  That was something you should have left well alone and instead asked what he could do to help you pay in the now towards what sounds like an expensive private college.", "YTA. \n\nFirst, your son doesn't \"deserve\" the money. No one \"deserves\" someone else's money. Not even your stepdaughter \"deserves\" the money, but that money has been promised to her. The fact that you talk about the money and your son in that way says a lot about who you are. \n\nSecond, how dare you. Just because Grace isn't of an academic nature that you don't feel is valid doesn't mean that money is up for grabs. I went to community college for two years- for financial reasons, my grades got me in to 4 year schools- and then transferred and went on to get a law degree and now am a CEO. Her education choices are valid. \n\nThird, if Noah was such a gift to the world, he would have gotten a scholarship and you wouldn't have to worry about money. \n\nSo finally, there was a whole host of options between the college fund only being for Noah or only being for Grace. Noah could take out some loans- you could too- and you could use some of the college funding for him now, and repay it for Grace for 3 years from now after community college was done. Noah doesn't need 4 years of funding now, and Grace doesn't need all the money now either. \n\nBut that wasn't good enough for you. You decided- selfishly- that your child DESERVED the money while Grace didn't, because she isn't as GIFTED as your dear child. That is full AH behavior and your husband is reprehensible for even contemplating it.", "YTA, your son does NOT deserve the money that was saved for your stepdaughter. That money has zero to do with your son because YOU didn\u2019t contribute to that fund and you have only known your new husband for 3 effing years. Your sense of entitlement is absolutely disgusting as is your gold digging family members.", "YTA and also lmao to \"we haven't saved enough college money for my son in the three years since we've been married but of course we can save enough college money for his daughter in one year to make up for stealing her college fund!\"", "YTA\n\nYOUR son needs money for school\u2026.YOU should be the one to provide it.

Average GPA, no extra curricular\u2019s and has even said that she\u2019s going to the community college close by for the first 2 years.\n\nPlus, she\u2019s a junior, we have a whole year to start building up another college fund for her.\n\nMy husband is still on the fence but at least he\u2019s not sticking with no. \n\nHe wanted to talk to his daughter first and reiterate what I said above.\n\nIt did not go well.\n\nHe said there was screaming involved and included her calling my son and I names that I will not be repeating here. Accusing him of cheating on her mother, which is completely false and she knows it, we met 3 years ago, 7 months after his divorce.\n\nI\u2019ve been getting a barrage of texts and voicemails from his ex-wife\u2019s side of the family, calling me all sorts of names.\n\nMy husband is disgusted with his daughters words and actions and is pretty upset and down right now.\n\nI feel like I\u2019ve caused this but my mother, sister and aunt are telling me that I did the right thing.

You married your husband, who had a child from a previous relationship. You signed on to be a stepmother, you don't get to not care about Grace. She is as much your daughter as Noah is your husband's son. \n\nThis has already damaged your relationship. Grace's response seemed to have shook her father to his core, because he cares about her. Grace will never look at you the same or perhaps Noah. There's no changing that, your actions have consequences. However, if you do try to take Grace's college fund there will be a dire set of consequences. \n\nGrace will likely present her father with an ultimatum: Her or you. A good father would kick you to the curb, but then again a good father would have thrown your idea in the trash the moment you asked. So, let's say he stays with you. Grace will tell her family what happened. Her mother's side and her father's, your in-laws, will form their own opinions of your actions. Now, I don't know who all is still around on either side or which side they'll even take. Then again everyone blood related to Noah is for this idea so I would assume all of those blood related to Grace will be against it. Grace's mother, if she still around, will likely come down upon you with hellfire and a lawyer. Whether or not anything happens in court depends on how good of a lawyer she has and if the divorce left any regard to how college funds are to be managed. \n\nBasically, you drilled a hole in your boat and are currently taking on water.

Expecting a man you\u2019ve known for three years to give up his daughter\u2019s college fund he\u2019s been saving since she was born for YOUR son is very asshole behavior. \n\nYTA.", "yeah the whole \"year to build up another one\" rubbed me the wrong way when seemingly she just won't be contributing to it after taking the sons whole savings", "Well, thats what usually happens when people with kids marry ppl with other kids...they tendo to put their bio offspring first", "Entitled is mild language for that woman.", "Noah doesn\u2019t have a college fund lol", "Why is Noah \u201cour\u201d son and Grace is \u201chis\u201d daughter? You married when these kids were teens. Noah is YOUR son.", "Absolutely! He could have gotten an easy full ride with a poor single mommy.", "A man who was her boss. It doesn\u2019t get more clich\u00e9.", "plus the 2 years she's at Community college", "I wonder why.", "How do interactions between her and you or Noah tend to go? Are you more hands off with her leave the parenting to her father, does she get on with Noah?", "Because you've made her feel unwanted and uncomfortable in her father's home. You've already pushed her away from her dad, isn't that enough or must you steal her college fund too?", "Your entitlement is disgusting. You reek of evil stepmother. YTA obviously.", "So because you don\u2019t know her you can only say negative things about her? Come on, you know that doesn\u2019t make sense. If you know so little about this girl how are you so confident she won\u2019t do well in college or even if she still wants to go to the community college? You\u2019re trying to make her look bad in an attempt to get us to view your son as \u201cmore worthy\u201d of HER college fund and it\u2019s blatantly obvious.", "With a opportunist, gold digger like you hanging around I know why she\u2019s not coming around \u2026.", "I wouldn\u2019t either if my dad\u2019s new wife wanted to take my college fund. This makes it even worse because in the limited and indirect contact you have with her it\u2019s to tell her you want her college fund for your son. SMH.", "Don't know her but want her money, interesting.\n\nAnd so ready to see her on fire so your son can be warm. \n\nIn the plus side, I think you are about to be a single mother again.", "Hold up let me ignore everything that's said and only comment about the job part. The audacity lol", "Not sure id personally stand and let a rando gold digger take my future away, so i hope Grace squares up and makes daddy think with his head rather than his d", "Teenagers can be a lot more perceptive than they're given credit for.", "That\u2019s not free?? Either way your son isn\u2019t entitled to any of the money. Maybe \u201chis\u201d daughter will want to do post graduate or additional studies. Maybe she\u2019ll an exchange program where she needs more funds. Either way it\u2019s her college fund, stop counting money that isn\u2019t yours.", "Your son can go to community college first! Your $2000 you have saved up will be a great start. He can work and go to school too like a million other college students do.", "And\u2026 YOU will be the person solely replacing the money her parents have been saving for 17 years?", "How do you not understand that 3 years and 17 years are very different? You know that\u2019s not enough time to replenish the fund right?", "You are disgusting, but you clearly dont care about anyone but your bio kid, why even post if all you do is deflect \n\"Oh but idk my husbands kid, she prob annidiot compared to my son so screw her\"\n\n\" Oh she doesnt visit, so idk if my PRECIOUS son screws her over\"", "You assume she\u2019s going to community college and then admit you don\u2019t know anything about her\u2026\n\nYuck", "She doesn't like our age gap but is okay with Noah", "Because she thinks you are a gold digger?", "No, you clearly have made her feel uncomfortable with her own dad and now think it\u2019s OK to steal from her college fund..\nYou say you don\u2019t know her well, so how do you know what kind of student she is?! \nSeriously If your husband takes the college fund away from grace, he will lose his daughter forever and that will be on YOU", "I didn't even notice the age gap.  What fortunate timing.  Just as your son was starting high school and needing to think about college (3 years ago), you found a husband with a good paying job and hefty savings account.  Gosh.  What a coincidence.  I wonder why Grace would be questioning the age gap.", "Yeah, the age gap is pretty insane, isn't it?", "I don't think it is just the age gap that is keeping her away.", "Nono, op is milking this guy for money to send her kid to college, thats a leech, not gold digger yet", "I did notice it, but didn't think it was worth noting because of the ages. It's OP deliberately avoiding details that's raising the missing missing reasons.", "She did marry her boss who is 23 years her senior.", "And once she learns the guy is a pushover who is willing to screw his own family just for pssy then op will ascend to a new level, full on gold digger, cant wait for future posts like\n\" Aita for making my husband remove his family from.the will so only me and OUR kid get everything\"", "So far, dude is standing strong. There is still hope for him. Mom could probably also take him to the cleaners if he gives their daughter\u2019s college fund away."]}
