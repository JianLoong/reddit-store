He has two brothers and they each have sons except for the one girl in question. We have one 10 month old son and I\u2019m pregnant with another boy. Being pregnant with a newly mobile baby is obviously very tiring so my in laws have offered to take him 1-2 during the week so I can rest and get errands done without baby in tow. I am very thankful for this! \n\nHowever, they also watch my niece multiple times a week and while she is an incredibly sweet and smart girl, the princess complex is REAL. Between being the first grandchild and the only girl she is beyond spoiled by my in laws. Her parents are also big on \u201cpermissive\u201d parenting meaning she eats nothing but candy and ice cream and watches TV 12 hours a day. I\u2019ve been with my husband for 10 years so I\u2019ve seen her behavior grow worse and worse over the years (through no fault of her own) but I\u2019ve always had a not my kid not my problem mindset. \n\nExcept now it is becoming my problem. My son is a great sleeper as long as he is kept to his schedule. Multiple times now my in laws have said \u201coh btw Son missed his nap today\u201d when I ask why they laugh and say Niece couldn\u2019t help herself and went into the room where he he was sleeping and woke him up. I then have to deal with an over tired and off schedule baby. I send my baby over with books and they have asked to be able to keep some of them because Niece really likes that book\u2026. no? We need books to read to my son at home. The final straw is when I walked in and Niece was yanking son around by his arms. My son can stand up and is working on walking and she was basically dragging him by the arm while he was half standing and in laws are just sitting there watching. \n\nAfter that I informed in laws that they will not be babysitting when niece is around anymore. They are more than welcome to watch him when no one else is over there because they actually do a good job otherwise but when niece is there they seem to forget my baby is a human with autonomy and allow her to treat him as her doll. \n\nThey\u2019re incredibly pissed at us and say we hate Niece. We don\u2019t but we obviously love our son more and don\u2019t like him being mistreated by her/them.

You are protecting your son from being disturbed, neglected, and potentially harmed by your niece and your in-laws!\n\nOf course you have every right to set boundaries and expectations for how your son is treated when he is in their care. \n\nYou are not hating on your niece, you are holding your in-laws accountable for their lack of supervision and discipline. \n\nYou are also doing your niece a favor by not enabling her spoiled and entitled behavior. \n\nThey need to respect your parenting decisions and your son's needs, or they will lose the privilege of babysitting him.", "NTA. Dealing with an overly tired baby is TORTURE and there\u2019s no way to fix it, you just have to manage to get through the day and start fresh in the morning. This is exhausting as it is, but I can\u2019t even imagine while pregnant. Plus it\u2019s not a great experience for the baby, either. Also, yanking a baby by the arms is dangerous and could cause the arm to come out of the socket. Obviously hats extremely excruciating. \n\nI do think the phrasing could have been a little bit nicer just to avoid tension. \u201cHey, your help is so appreciated but from now on, we\u2019re only going to send the baby to you when (niece) isn\u2019t there. It\u2019s just too overstimulating for him and it messes with his routine. She\u2019s also a little rough with him and it makes us nervous.\u201d I also probably would have let the book thing slide; they are doing you a big favor and would it really be an issue to leave just a couple of them there? That way your baby has books at home and at grandma\u2019s.", "NTA at all but I would expect that they still won\u2019t honor your wishes and the niece will come over when they have your baby", "NTA. You need to make sure your son is left in good care and good care isn't reliable when niece is there.  Period, end of discussion.  Being honest with your in-laws was good because it did give them a chance to 1) let you know when they would only be watching your son and 2) take actions to remedy the situation.  \n\nYour son's safety is your first concern.", "NTA because they are still responsible for her actions and it doesn't take much effort to teach a child how to behave with a baby. 8 is old enough to understand that babies are fragile", "op=NTA\n\nYou've set a boundary, they can accept it or not.  Not means not having time with your child.  Stand firm.  \n\nBecause next it will be YOUR kid being fed so much sugar he's riding a sugar high for hours after he gets home and he'll decide he'd rather follow the Grand's rules than yours.\n\nI get bending a few rules, but not breaking them.\n\nAnd pulling your son around like that could physically HARM him--so NO NO AND NO", "NTA", "NTA.
