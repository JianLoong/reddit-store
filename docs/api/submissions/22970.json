He has two brothers and they each have sons except for the one girl in question. We have one 10 month old son and I\u2019m pregnant with another boy.

I am very thankful for this! \n\nHowever, they also watch my niece multiple times a week and while she is an incredibly sweet and smart girl, the princess complex is REAL. Between being the first grandchild and the only girl she is beyond spoiled by my in laws. Her parents are also big on \u201cpermissive\u201d parenting meaning she eats nothing but candy and ice cream and watches TV 12 hours a day. I\u2019ve been with my husband for 10 years so I\u2019ve seen her behavior grow worse and worse over the years (through no fault of her own) but I\u2019ve always had a not my kid not my problem mindset. \n\nExcept now it is becoming my problem. My son is a great sleeper as long as he is kept to his schedule. Multiple times now my in laws have said \u201coh btw Son missed his nap today\u201d when I ask why they laugh and say Niece couldn\u2019t help herself and went into the room where he he was sleeping and woke him up. I then have to deal with an over tired and off schedule baby. I send my baby over with books and they have asked to be able to keep some of them because Niece really likes that book\u2026. no? We need books to read to my son at home. The final straw is when I walked in and Niece was yanking son around by his arms. My son can stand up and is working on walking and she was basically dragging him by the arm while he was half standing and in laws are just sitting there watching. \n\nAfter that I informed in laws that they will not be babysitting when niece is around anymore. They are more than welcome to watch him when no one else is over there because they actually do a good job otherwise but when niece is there they seem to forget my baby is a human with autonomy and allow her to treat him as her doll. \n\nThey\u2019re incredibly pissed at us and say we hate Niece. We don\u2019t but we obviously love our son more and don\u2019t like him being mistreated by her/them.

You need to make sure your son is left in good care and good care isn't reliable when niece is there.  Period, end of discussion.

Children\u2019s aren\u2019t dumb\u2026they just need to be parented, given boundaries, and watched. All of which isn\u2019t happening with your niece.

Be straightforward. This is non-negotiable. If niece is there your son is not. No exceptions. \n\nNiece is abusing your child. She is disturbing his peace.

My brothers son was born like a sumo wrestler. He was almost 11 pounds and over two feet tall. By he time he was 2, he weighed more than my 4 year old and was almost as tall. He was extremely violent and aggressive. My parents loved babysitting and would ask all the time. I had to stop letting him over there if my nephew was there because he was hurting my youngest. Now they are great friends", "NTA - but the niece is going to become an even greater problem the older she grows.", "That's not gentle (or permissive) parenting. \nIt's not parenting at all. Even in gentle parenting, you need to make some rules. For exemple \"don't physically abuse your baby cousin\" is a very obvious one.  NTA", "NTA, you have to prioritize care for your son.  And the fact they see nothing wrong with her dragging him around like that is really concerning.   \n\n\nI think you're blaming the 8 year old too much in the sense that you're giving her any blame.  She's still young enough she needs adults to set boundaries on her behavior, but they're not doing that. So if anything you should be more upset with your in laws that they're enabling the bad parenting practices of your family.", "Just an FYI from a mom of 4.  As soon as you establish a sleep schedule, baby switches it up.  \nI\u2019m not saying your niece isn\u2019t contributing to your problem but your parents have proven to be lax babysitters.  They\u2019ll free babysit but not on your terms.  So ease up or say no thank you, you can\u2019t have it both ways.", "NTA your niece could have really hurt your baby and your grandparents would have not known.   Don\u2019t let grandparents babysit, period.", "NTA.  They don't see able to tell her no and your son needs to be on a schedule AND safe.", "NTA it\u2019s an unfortunate situation that\u2019s your in laws making but you have to protect your kids. It\u2019s good seeing you realize it\u2019s not the girls fault just an effect of how family raised her. Perhaps in time when the dusts has settled try and have a conversation with the in-laws it may be pointless but worth trying it\u2019s possible they don\u2019t see how they favor one grandchild over all", "Eight is also plenty old enough (so is 3, honestly) for a child to learn to respect a baby\u2019s level of autonomy and treat them with kindness and gentleness. They aren\u2019t doing her any favors by teaching her to treat younger kids as props.", "And cps called when the child has a spiral fracture which they will think the parents did.", "That\u2019s what I\u2019m feeling bad about because I truly do not blame my niece she never has bad intentions. I just didn\u2019t know how else to get the point across that she cannot be allowed to treat my son that way. 100% blame goes to her parents and my in laws.", "Yeaaaah that\u2019s not how babysitting works. Even if you aren\u2019t getting paid, you still follow parent\u2019s rules. It\u2019s not your child, not your rules.", "We\u2019re all props in her world honestly haha the amount of times this child has been allowed to choose where the family is going out for dinner, what movie is going to be watched, etc is honestly insane. It was much easier to ignore when I didn\u2019t have kids of my own.", "They probably still would have insulted you said that unfortunately", "This isn't discipline you are asking for but adequate care. If they cannot provide that, that's on them.", "I have a nephew who was raised that way. He is a young friendless adult and non of the other grandkids want to visit the grandparents because they can\u2019t stand to be around him.", "Her parents are creating an entitled monster. I fear for the next girl born into the family, I can't imagine that the \"little princess\" will take being \"upstaged\" very well...\n\nYou are NTA, her parents are huge AHs.", "NTA - niece dragging son around by his arm is asking for an ER visit (and CPS coming to your house).\n\n\nNiece is the asshole and her parents as the assholes for not parenting.", "NTA Your #1 priority is to protect your kid. Lucky he hasn't had \"nursemaid's elbow\" from being yanked around.", "NTA. People who don\u2019t understand or care how crucial naps are for kids that age are TA.

If grandparents are gonna let her treat him like a baby doll your right to keep him away from her. That\u2019s insane. I wouldn\u2019t trust them to watch him at all anymore honestly.
