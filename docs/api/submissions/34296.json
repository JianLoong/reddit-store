It certainly doesn't involve bitching at OP for waking him like he expects her to. Stop babying grown men and demanding women fix the broken parts.", "Even if it's a medical problem it's still an asshole move to just expect his partner to do all the work and to not communicate anything in the slightest. \n\nHe sets 8 alarms and expects her to wake him up. He didn't communicate \"Hey, I have a problem, I don't hear my alarms can we set one so that you could please wake me up?\" \n\nEven after OP warned him that the wake up Service is off duty for a day he didn't said anything about how important she is to him waking up and just complained afterwards.", "Sleeping disorders can be serious. I have a fatigue based condition myself, though separate from a sleep disorder. My brain doesn\u2019t function for some time after I wake and I barely know what is going on. You are right, it\u2019s not her fault at all what is happening. However your response is the typical Reddit idealistic, everyone must be able to be rational and normal with zero leeway for any added complications or they are AH. \nMy response was there way be more to it and him blowing up could be a consequence of that that he can\u2019t control because of a disorder. \n\nNever. Said. It. Was. Her. Problem. \n\nHowever as his wife, she obviously wants to be able to support what he is struggling with as partners do.", "Too much, and too late to fix it.Rolling with it babes", "Not really but trying mate whats up", "I do. If it\u2019s close I wake up at night and go get it lmao", "Knew a guy who had to lock his in the closet because he would just snooze it and sleep in and be late. He put a padlock on the door and put the key downstairs so he had to physically get out if bed and get the key to shut it off.", "If you have adhd, you should understand how important routines are to get shit done", "Yes, overwhelming fatigue and depression makes one just spring out of bed in the morning, I\u2019m sure.", "Youre doing it again now\u2026 mothering him. He should look into sleep apnea himself. If he doesn\u2019t then it\u2019s up to him, his choice. You can suggest it to him but for the love of god, don\u2019t do it for him.", "Have you told him this might cause resentment? Is it really worth it for him? He is being really irresponsible and I would make sure he realizes that it is extremely frustrating that he is being like this. He should figure something out. People like him that I know set up 4-5 alarms in the course of 1 hour to be able to wake up on time. Maybe get a very loud alarm but it is still annoying when you will probably wake up to every alarm while he ignores all.", "Yeah, he could probably do with a sleep study to see if there is an underlying issue. In the meantime he could try looking up better sleeping habits and see if adding those to his routine helps. \n\nThere are also different alarm types other than beeping. He could try a vibrating alarm and see if that wakes him up more.", "I thought you said his mum woke him up for work before you", "Why are you looking into it? HE should be looking into it.", "I agree sleep/fatigue disorders are serious as I know from family experience. \n\nAnd yes, a person who\u2019s suffering through this can be groggy and grumpy, especially in the morning. \n\nBUT - he\u2019s an AH for being furious with OP. He\u2019s a grown-ass adult and needs to take responsibility for this. \n\nOP commented that before her, his mum had to wake him everyday. I mean ffs. \n\nHe knows he has a problem. He needs to seek a professional diagnosis and solution for both their sakes.", "You aren\u2019t saying it\u2019s her problem, but you are ~~effectively~~ saying she should shut up and take this treatment on the (let\u2019s be realistic) minuscule off chance that he has some rare sleep disorder. I know what\u2019s more likely\u2026", "It\u2019s never too late to change your ways.", "Then go to therapy and stop being an asshole.", "Reading this at 4 AM, lol. Is it the middle of the night right now where you are?", "Who says i dont follow routines ? Its alot more complex then you seem to think.", "No I\u2019m not. I haven\u2019t said any of that. That is pure fiction in your own head. \nI said there could be more to it and getting specialist help may be in order, which is a damn site better than your dismissive \u2018I bet he\u2019s just an AH because I like to think the worst of people\u2019 highlighted by inventing things I haven\u2019t said. Life isn\u2019t and/or. She can be both pissed off and supportive. To note, I haven\u2019t accused her of not being supportive, she has. This is just another suggestion meant to help. As someone having her life disrupted, yeah pissed off, I would be. As his wife, let\u2019s find a solution and maybe investigate help. Not just go with not my problem.", "thnx for karma m8", "Nah man. Man it up until your 40s then taste the barell.Ez", "No I\u2019m at work. It\u2019s midday.", "What makes you think I don\u2019t have adhd ?", "Before you get too high and mighty here you should read OP\u2019s replies. Apparently he\u2019s entirely capable of getting himself up if she isn\u2019t there. Sorry you\u2019re so mad about my take, but this guy doesn\u2019t deserve boundless compassion. He\u2019s being a lazy shit, end of. There ya go - nothing from \u201cmy own head.\u201d Want to apologize for the ridiculous assumptions YOU made up about me? Didn\u2019t think so. What an ass.\n\nDownvoted by this loser and their little friend for speaking facts. Lmao", "The lack of empathy and judgment/one way fits them all mindset relating to the mention of adhd. \nMost people tend to be empathic about issues they share with others, especially diagnosis", "Oh jesus, you are one of them. Please, I offered a solution and didn\u2019t have one go at her. You got high and mighty and assumptive and just want arguments. Have a good day.", "Oh my word that's a big attitude you have. The person you're talking to was just being reasonable no need to be such a dick.", "We shared like two sentences and all I said was that routines are important for people with adhd.", "\u201cOne of them,\u201d so how often do you have these paranoid delusions? I see you want to use that to distract from the actual details OP revealed which contradict your read of the situation. Kind of a weird plan, since anyone can read their replies and see you assumed a rare sleep disorder over the commonplace occurrence of a man being a jerk.", "Mate, stop harassing me. I\u2019m not that invested in her marriage to sit reading everything she writes. I offered a solution, she can choose whether it fits her situation or not.
