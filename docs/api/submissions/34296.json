I've tried the \"other side of the room\" trick, and it failed for me: what ended up happening is I'd get extremely good at turning off the alarm without fully waking up, making snoozing a viable option. Thus eventually making the alarm ignorable.\n\nIMO the most effective means of waking up though is going to sleep at the correct time to be fully rested and then refusing to allow yourself to snooze, so you don't become alarm-deaf. In other words, a person really just has to physically leave the bed for the morning and start walking around as soon as they're conscious. I admit, I couldn't really do this, BUT another effective strategy is to simply have a morning routine and make it a habit, e.g. set alarm 15 minutes early, snooze once, then get up and use toilet/brush teeth/shower, make a cup of coffee. Habits are easy to maintain and take no willpower, which will give a person the strength to avoid the temptation to snooze. \n\nThat said, it's not on OP to solve her BF's problem here.

He may have slept earlier, had less stress, done things that made his sleep better, or responded easier to noise when he was alone.\n\nDo you two sleep together, does his alarm set up and snoring bother you too and impact your sleep?\n\nDraw a line in the sand, if he doesn\u2019t take steps to improve then you stop helping. Mention sleep apnea and how snoring means hes choking for air in his sleep. His brain is begging him for oxygen and if he\u2019s insured there\u2019s no point not trying to get a cpap or something to fix that issue. If he\u2019s immature about that maybe mention the testosterone and growth hormone bensfits of actually getting quality sleep.

How far has he and would he go for you is an important thing to wonder. My gf has helped me when I sleep through an alarm and says I\u2019ve had full blown conversations with her that I just don\u2019t remember. Sleep brain is fucking weird and I fixed it soon after when I realized it could be bad if I said something stupid to her or impacted her mornings. I\u2019ve even slept through alarms across the room and stood up and turned them off without actually waking up. Most people here would tell her to move on and call me immature, while they wouldn\u2019t be entirely wrong I\u2019m also there for every situation in her life where she needs someone to lift her up. And the most important thing is that I recognized the impact this could have on our relationship and took steps to fix it. If your s.o only whines and doesn\u2019t seek ways to fix it then you can\u2019t possibly be an asshole. If he has no idea this is potentially a medical issue then he\u2019s also not an asshole he might just think he\u2019s simply tough to wake up.", "I think he does ignore them; because he notices her, responds verbally to her, and then goes back to sleep anyway.

The sucess rate of treating with medication is very high, because, its not a willpower and discipline issue. Its being neuro divergent.", "I couldn't be in a relationship with someone like that. No one is going to blame me for any of that and it's incredibly inconsiderate to do that to your partner simply because you don't want to get up and be an adult. I doubt this is the only instance of his inconsiderate and frankly, childish behavior. Tell him to go back home to live with his mommy. You're getting anxiety from this behavior!

They don't lack virtue because they can't wake up. It's a huge problem for them - in another hundred years, we may have a better understanding and more accommodations, but right now, unless he's persistent and lucky, this is probably his life. For moment, think of it like 'sleepADHD'. He's not lazy, and he's mad because his life is frustrating. He can't make himself wake up like he and others assume he can.\n\nAgain, you are not NTA. I genuinely feel for you. I know the stress of being someone else's alarm clock. Caretaking is incredibly stressful, and that's what you're doing, without any acknowledgement or accommodation. \n\nYou are both in a very tough spot and I wish you both well.

Some people literally can't just set one alarm and get up, there are lots of potential reasons (it's my case it's not because I'm not going to bed early enough). But the difference is that my alarms are silent vibration only alarms and they don't wake my husband up. Because I'm not selfish enough to think my husband should have to keep getting woken up before he needs to be just because I'm experiencing difficulties. How would it be fair to make my problem his problem? Sounds like your partner doesn't respect you", "Setting that many alarms is working against you. Your brain knows you set that many, thus knows there is something to fall back on. I am a reformed snoozer, and the key was no more 10 alarms. I set 3 absolute max.\n\nAnother super helpful tactic is to use a light alarm. My bedroom lamp is set to do a sunrise where it gradually gets brighter until it's alarm time where it goes to full brightness. I forgot to set any alarms this week after not setting any over the holidays and my trusty light saved my ass haha.", "Same! I'd get up to the scan the barcode of a book across the room and then solve a division problem and still go back to sleep", "Agree. My ex- used to snooze the alarms and expect me to wake him up.

Wow, are you a vampire?", "Then this is a control issue . . . . Get out now.  He's making you responsible for him to control you.  This is not healthy.  Get out NOW.", "I'm going to play devil's advocates and ask if he does actually wake himself up like normal or if it's anxiety fuelled when you're away? I have autism and adhd combined with sleep apnea that makes waking up very difficult. Both of these things fuel my anxiety on vacations to the point that I can't sleep because I'm scared ill miss an alarm. Is he not sleeping well when on these trips? \n\nI personally suspect a delayed circadian rhythm for myself which causes my body to violently react to waking up earlier than its used to. He should be investigated for sleep disorders and undiagnosed neurological conditions like adhd as there are many that can cause a delayed sleep cycle. Once those are ruled out then he absolutely needs to take responsibility for himself. \n\nAs someone who struggles to wake up and is repeatedly late for work, my opinion is that it's not anyone else's responsibility other than yours to make sure you're up. It sucks when you oversleep, but if you have the conversations you need to with the people expecting you at a certain time, he may experience less anxiety when he oversleeps and won't lose his ability to regulate his emotions.", "It may not exactly be a logical consequence, but hey it worked and you followed up with what you said you would do.", ">\"if I have to get up, so do you\n\nwith the addition of \"and you'll have way less sleep than me because you'll have repetitive alarms waking you for almost 2 hours before I finally get up\"", "Not just an alarm clock, she said she has to physically get him out of bed.
