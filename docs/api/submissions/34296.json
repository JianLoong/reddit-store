He has no one but HIMSELF to blame.", "Okay so, I do understand what it's like to have a hard time waking up. That said, if I had this much trouble, I'd put an alarm on the other side of the room so I had to get up and shut it off. I'm sort of surprised nobody has suggested this. It seems like an easy fix that would force him to get up and fix it. Especially if he has one alarm by his head and another across the room. sometimes that's just what it takes.\n\nNTA", "NTA, time for him to grow up and wake up on his own for work like an adult. What does he do if you\u2019re away from home for a night or on a trip, etc? Not wake up, miss work and blame you for not being home to wake him up? He needs to take some responsibility for his own life.", "NTA he\u2019s being immature. You also warned him and he didn\u2019t listen, he\u2019s gotta grow up", "NTA", "NTA! He should get checked for sleep apnea by the way.", "This is HIS responsibility,  not yours. He's an adult & acting like a child. Stick to your guns & refuse to nudge him awake. Don't cave. He will eventually learn to get up himself. Also, I'm sorry you have to deal with this. Not cool of your bf.", "NTA: but I\u2019d recommend speaking to a doctor. A relative had a similar issue and folks saying they needed to grow up. After being referred to a sleep clinic, it transpired they had an actual sleep disorder. It may be worth looking in to as this is excessive.", "NTA, you were very generous by warning him that you would not be waking him up as usual.", "[deleted]", "NTA- what the hell did he do before you moved in?

It's natural consequences.", "Is your partner a child or an adult?  If he is an adult, he can wake up on his own.  But you know this and so does he.  The only way I would say you would be T A, it would be if you continued to feed into this behavior.\n\nEither stop waking him up, or wake him up in a way he wouldn't appreciate such as splashing his face with a glass full of water.\n\nNTA", "NTA. You're his partner, not his nanny. If he has that much trouble getting up he needs to work on his sleep routine or see a specialist.", "Nta he needs consequences to his actions", "NTA.

But assuming he isn't staying up ridiculously late I'd speak to a Dr about this. I used to do this (sleep through alarms) and turned out I was anaemic.\n\nI think things like diabetes can also present in similar ways.\n\nHe is a jerk for how he reacted though.", "NTA\nYou're his partner,  not his mom.

This won't be the only thing he'll expect of you if you keep waking him.", "NTA\n\nYou're his partner not his mum!", "NTA. Please do not have a child with this man, I promise it will only get worse.", "NTA.  He is a grown ass adult and can figure this out. You're not his parent.\n\nActually. I don't even have to do this for my teen children and they get out the door on time.", "NTA that's a child's behaviour. Adults have responsibility and should be able to wake up without 7 or 8 alarms.. that's crazy.", "Had the same problem.

If I move his phone alarm next to his ear he doesn't care - he can sleep through it and won't shut it off.  It just rings until I get so sick of it that *I* turn it off.", "I have to second this.\nHe's probably not an asshole. \nI will sleep through my alarms to the point that neighbours made noise complaints to my landlord. \nThey don't wake me, and just because I talk back to you doesn't mean I'm actually awake.\nSames true of my mother.\nNow, personally, I manage this by sleeping early and waking up hours earlier than absolutely nessecery naturally as I know sound won't do a thing for me.\nI'd recommend he do something similar. \n\nHowever when this isn't practical, I thank my good fortunes to have a supportive partner who understands what's going and knows that the most effective hing to do is forcefully shaking my shoulders and appreciate her even more for doing it.", "I dont wanna nudge him awake anymore because he doesn't just get up.

So you know what the problem is. Be firm on this one\u2014 tell him you are not his mother in any capacity. If you dump him, what does he expect to do? Move back in with his mommy and wait for the next significant other to come along and fill the role? \n\nYou might actually want to send him this post to help get the point across if talking doesn\u2019t help.", "Well, do you think he stays asleep on purpose? If an alarm doesn't wake him up, it doesn't wake him up. If something doesn't wake me up, I can't will myself to wake up to that thing tomorrow. It sounds like you (and most of Reddit) are blaming him for what might actually be a medical problem. He should be the one trying to address it, but maybe he doesn't realize how bad it is because you're there to wake him up. Have a talk with him instead of just noping out of a situation when there's a good chance he literally can't control it.", "I read in the replies that someone mentioned sleep apnea, and my partner heavily snores in his sleep, so I'm gonna look into that.\n\nAside from this, he is entirely capable of waking himself up for work because before we lived together and during times when I'm not home, he's always at work on time. I honestly think at this point he's got into the habit of expecting me to nudge him awake so he can have that extra 5 minutes of sleep. The weird thing is, we never agreed I would wake him up - he just started sleeping in and setting copious alarms, knowing I would panic he would be late to work and nudge him awake. I think ignoring the alarms is certainly deliberate because he's trained himself to know that unless I'm shoving him awake, it's not *really* time to get up.", "How long has this been happening and have you noticed the snoring getting worse? I'm wondering if his sleep issues escalated and that's causing the problem. I understand your reasoning for refusing to wake him up though. Maybe you're right and it's somewhat deliberate at this point. We do have the ability to wake up very slightly and make a decision about whether to wake up the rest of the way.", "The snoring has always been there, and it's always been loud but never gotten worse (from what I can tell).", "At this point I think you need to have a talk with him that goes something like:\n\n\"You're waking up when I nudge you, but not waking up to your many, many alarms. Do you hear them and consciously go back to sleep, or are you actually not noticing until I wake you up?\"\n\nAlso, I think if he wakes up enough to make conscious decisions he shouldn't snore anymore, but I could be wrong about that."]}
