This isn't something I can get over so I'm gonna go ahead and say that we shouldn't see each other anymore. Thank you for the great(if they were) times but this is a deal breaker for me. Wish you the best!!\"", "YWNBTA. This SHIT is disgusting.", "Eh\u2026I\u2019m actually going to go with NAH on this one (except the literal unwashed one) You say that this individual has used your shower \u2018many times\u2019 and there has never been any issue before. So you\u2019ve somehow generalized this as meaning your\u2026person\u2026just doesn\u2019t wash their ass, as in infrequently or never. Obviously, I have my own biases, but this sounds a heck of a lot like a single anomaly, not a trend. I experienced something similar while visiting family a few years back. Normally, I always make sure to wash off the back patio, but this one time, I forgot for some reason or another, and left a little streak on the towel after drying off. The difference with my situation was that I noticed it, spot cleaned it as best I could, and tossed it straight into the wash. I\u2019d probably just chalk this one up to the skid marker having a similar lapse in his/her (98% sure it\u2019s a he, let\u2019s just be honest) shower routine, given that it\u2019s never been a problem before. You have every right to find someone else\u2019s feces on your towel gross, but at the same time, it seems rather extreme to distance yourself from whatever you want to call this relationship over a single minor incident.", "NTA. - You did nothing wrong in the story you provided. It is perfectly reasonable to feel the way you do, for all the well thought out reasons you provided. I would only suggest being direct in your communication with him. Tell him his dirty ass left a stain on your towel and you want to know how that was possible given he had just taken a shower. Maybe, and this is a big maybe, he had a questionable fart just after getting out and he wasn\u2019t aware he actually sharted. Given your history with him, don\u2019t ghost him\u2026 it sounds like he at least deserves an explanation- even if it is blunt, maybe even better that way so there is no misunderstanding.
