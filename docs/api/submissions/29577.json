NONE of what you described is flirting, lol.  YTA.", "Yeah this sounds like your definition of flirting came from a TikTok or a teen magazine step by step guide. \n\nNot convinced this was flirting, but flirting is also not cheating? There's a whole lot of nuances that you don't seem to have a grasp of, but sometimes as a younger woman it's fun to indulge a flirty older man because literally nothing will come from it but a couple laughs on both sides.", "Counterpoint - you\u2019re gaslighting your whole family that her interactions were flirting.", "It's not soon enough for you to learn that _women laughing is not flirting_. \n\nOther than that, _who_ is this mysterious person older than your parents that you think she's flirting with?", "Yeah that's not flirting. That's just being nice and outgoing. I know a lot of women who act like that and it has nothing to do with them being flirty.", "Yeah touching the arm or shoulder and being overly laughing is 100% flirting.  Don\u2019t let these other commenters fool you (I\u2019m sure they\u2019re alt accounts for the wife ;)\n\nThat said, if it\u2019s at a party your brother and parents are also present for, I\u2019d be on the side of \u201cjust leave it alone\u201d. If you had more than that (like you saw her coming out of a bedroom while adjusting her clothes with some guy in tow), that\u2019s for sure worth addressing. But this kind of flirting is just note it and let it pass", "Yeah that\u2019s not flirting, it\u2019s clear you\u2019re way too young to be even talking about this", "Why did you come here if you are going to argue with everyone when it is very clear that the majority of people have voted you TA?", "Cool story. You're not acting like an adult though and your brain isn't fully developed. \n\nYou can't even use gaslighting in the proper way either.", "Not based on this post, you aren\u2019t.", "You are still a teenager, eighteen. Go live life and some life experience.", "I remember being 18 and thinking I was an adult and knew it all. Someday when you\u2019re older you\u2019ll look back and laugh at how you are now. But the fact is, you are still a child and know very little about how the world and relationships work. Just as they did back when they were your age.", "Just because you\u2019re 18 doesn\u2019t make you an adult. You\u2019re legally an adult but mentally, most people aren\u2019t fully matured until 25", "Right, the 18th birthday is magical. The moment the clock strikes midnight, you immediately stop thinking like a teenager and start thinking like an adult. Being an adult has nothing to do with life experience, right? It's all about turning 18!\n\nWay to show you're still a teenager.", "Do all your friends now know the backstory of your brother and his wife?", "They\u2019re all just pissed that you called out a woman and not a man.", "There is a difference between legally being an adult and actually being an adult, and you are still a child kiddo despite your age. You need to do a lot of maturing before you can claim to be an adult.", "You\u2019re 18, you have no idea what gaslighting actually looks like, you also have nowhere near enough relationship experience to be sticking your nose in your brothers relationship. Mind your business", "You are technically an adult like a tomato is technically a fruit. Everyone here will admit you are legally an adult. One day when you are actually an adult you will realize, oh shit I definitely wasn't an adult at 18 and I honestly had no idea what being an adult was.", "Can you read her fucking mind? OF COURSE it matters if she was a freaking child when it happened. That's one of the more ridiculous statements I've heard on here lol", "Exactly!!", "Agreed! My partner was dumb and cheated as a teenager. He told me about at the very beginning of our relationship. We are happily engaged with two kids, been together for five years with no cheating. Or anything close to borderline inappropriate behavior.", "I guess being told you\u2019re wrong about something is now considered gaslighting by 2023 standards?", ">lol how tf is laughing flirting? I've hit on a fuckton of people then\n\nIf laughing is always flirting, clearly stand-up comedians are pulling the highest body counts.", "Bro that\u2019s 100% flirting. Sorry to ruin so many memories where you didn\u2019t realize girls were flirting with you.", "I read a recent study that suggested the age might be closer to 30 now. I know I was a dumbass with a half-developed brain until at least 33.", "My close friends do because I was devastated when I found out", "A partner cheating on someone else before your relationship started is not the same as a partner cheating in the relationship and that person taking them back.\n\nShe will never fully respect him as she knows that she fucked another dude while dating him but he still took her back, and he's always going to have it lingering in the back of his head that she cheated on him. The relationship isn't going to last.", "It is if you're a relatively immature 18 yrs and what someone is telling you doesn't match up with your inexperienced and locked down world view and the people around you don't immediately take action when you insist they go with your flow.", "I mean...Pete Davidson?", "I\u2019m gay lol but nice try. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f", "Oh really?? Ya know, now that I think about it, I was pretty dumb still in my late 20s as well", "Wow so you are double the asshole here. Not only did you stick your nose where it didn't belong you also spread personal information about your brother to people that had absolutely no business knowing his personal business.", "Why? It didn\u2019t involve you and it\u2019s not your relationship.", "You\u2019re devastated by something that happened years ago?", "No its not exactly the same but some  people learn from their mistakes. I wouldn\u2019t exactly say he took her back. For it sounds like they spent some years apart before coming back together. They both grew and felt something was still there. You are also making an assumption she doesn\u2019t respect him for her making a mistake as an teenager on him. She an adult now.", "They were teenagers. It was probably +10 years ago. \nI know this sub loveeeees to say cheaters deserve the death penalty but someone cheating when they were kids and picking up a relationship 10 years down the road and we don't know anything about them.", "Ok so I\u2019ll give you a pass that you don\u2019t know how women flirt. But that\u2019s 100% flirting every time. Touching his arm and shoulder?  Big time flirting. Don\u2019t understand the up votes you\u2019re getting because you\u2019re not spitting facts.", "I'm pretty dumb now and in my late 30s... \ud83e\udd14", "I\u2019m a 45 year old woman and have behaved like this with people I\u2019m not flirting with. So perhaps she really was not flirting \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "It\u2019s flirting when you\u2019re about in middle or high school, or an incel\u2019s fantasy, Adults don\u2019t actually flirt like that lol", "Am a flirtatious girl. That\u2019s definitely how girls flirt.", "Of course we don\u2019t know what was in her head. Are those things that lots and lots of women do when they\u2019re flirting?  Absolutely. It\u2019s 100% flirting behavior. Does that guarantee she was actually flirting?  No. Does her not being conscious of it mean she wasn\u2019t subconsciously flirting?  Maybe she was. \n\nCase in point:  my now wife was doing all of those things when we met in a group setting, and later when we talked about it she had no idea she was doing any of that.", "Exactly hahahaha. Imagine not being able to laugh at someones jokes. And everyone has a different level of touchiness. \n\nMiddle school level or incel level don't know which.", "Lmaoo", "Lol you\u2019re joking. Of course they do.  Google it if you don\u2019t believe me. It\u2019s literally every list. And I also speak from experience."]}
