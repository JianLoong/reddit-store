He was so inconsiderate that even after a seizure he would expect me to get up and be normal again and get back to doing my \u201cduties\u201d and chores. I stayed til my youngest was 5. I suffered emotionally and mentally cause the doctors didn\u2019t know what was wrong and my ex couldn\u2019t care less. I was just being dramatic in his eyes even after seeing my episodes.\n\nOne day I was thinking and it hit me that I was letting my daughters grow up seeing their father treat me like that and would likely grow up to accept this behavior (just like I saw my mother deal with). It was that realization (and the dr telling me if my health didn\u2019t get better I would have more years behind me instead of ahead me and I was only 31 at the time) that made me realize that if I didn\u2019t prioritize myself my daughters wouldnt have their mother. It made me see that how I was living was no way to live.\n\nI share this to say, that you never know how the people who you tie yourself to can negatively impact you. When I left him, my health started to slowly improve. Took 3 more years but leaving him allowed me to prioritize myself and get healthy to the point that I wasn\u2019t having seizures and having less and less heart palpitations. As an added bonus my money flourished and I\u2019ve been able to completely rebuild my life and my health. \n\nThat man doesn\u2019t care. And he benefits from you overthinking and allowing ppl to tell you you\u2019re being dramatic.
