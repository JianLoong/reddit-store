One of them was Harry, Tom\u2019s new work mate. I\u2019ve met Harry a few times and he seemed okay, nice enough. \n\nHe brought his wife with him, Claire (f, late 20s I guess). It was my first time meeting her and I\u2019ll admit, she rubbed me the wrong way. She was just so judgy about everything. But I didn\u2019t have much time to talk to her as I completely forgot to buy mixers for drinks and had to run to the shops. \n\nI was gone for maybe 10 or 20 minutes but when I came back, the music was turned off and everyone was on the living room. Claire said \u201cperfect, we were waiting for you. We can start now.\u201d\n\nI was confused but when I got closer, everything was clear. She decided to throw an MLM party during another party. She had a table set up with her products and flyers and all that crap.\n\nI was annoyed but I let her do her thing hoping that she\u2019ll be done and we can carry on with the party.\n\nAlas, when she was done, she told everyone that she set up a table in my kitchen and we can go and buy products and sign up to be a rep or whatever it\u2019s called.\n\nI\u2019ve had enough at this point.\n\nI should mention that MLMs are not yet huge in my country, at least not the most predatory ones but they\u2019re growing. Still, many people are completely clueless about them. And since I spend way too much time online, I\u2019m quite aware of them.\n\nI told her to stop it and there won\u2019t be any MLM selling in my house. Everyone was confused. She started defending her \u201ccompany\u201d saying that it\u2019s not an MLM because they\u2019re illegal, blah blah. Then tried to guilt trip me saying that i don\u2019t support small businesses (I quite literally run a legitimate small business).\nI quickly had enough and told her to get the fuck out. She started packing, really angry. Making sure to call me some names, including asshole. Her husband helped her pack and they left.\n\nMy husband was really angry that I embarrassed him and Harry and should\u2019ve just let it go and support her. I tried to explain to him that I couldn\u2019t because she\u2019ll get other people sucked into her scheme.\n\nMy husbands friends were divided even after I explained what MLMs are.\n\nToday, Claire has been messaging me all they, sending me screenshot of some weird Facebook group comments supporting her and calling me a jerk, etc. My husband is still annoyed with me.\n\nI thought I was right but with everyone ganging up on me, I\u2019m not so sure.

Who takes over a party to try and sell some shit to people. I\u2019m trying to have a good time not get a sales pitch. Fuxk your husband for being annoyed also, but I can see where there would be friction.", "Someone you just met and allowed into YOUR home decided to overrun the get-together, (specifically when you were not present) by turning into an MLM presentation/recruitment?\n\nNTA but your husband and his friend and the girlfriend absolutely are.", "NTA - mlm/small business discussion aside, it\u2019s incredibly classless to hijack someone else\u2019s birthday party to promote your own wares. Plus - he wasn\u2019t even a friend, he was a workmate and a new one at that. They\u2019re opportunistic at best and predatory at worst.", "NTA, she is though. Who goes to a stranger's house for a party and sets up a sales gig. It was wildly inappropriate. I'm impressed you waited for her to finish her sales pitch I would have kicked her out immediately.", "NTA. This was meant to be for your husband's birthday. She'd clearly decided to do this beforehand and had no respect for the occasion. She then tried to dictate to you what would happen in your own home. I don't understand why your husband is supporting her.", "NTA.  Outrageous to be expected to host an MLM hostage scenario without you agreeing to it in exchange for some... sexy Tupperware, or spices for people who hate spices, or what have you.", "Omg. The /r/antimlm sub will have a field day with this.\n\nObviously NTA. Those MLM \u201chuns\u201d as they\u2019re known as are sadly brainwashed and a little cuckoo for Cocoa Puffs.", "NTA. Take out the mlm part,  that is just inappropriate in general. Especially since you as the host didn't know.  Instead of calling out the mlm, call out her behavior.  That there was no communication she would do that and was disrespectful. Yes most mlm are scams so good for you!", "If it helps cut to the heart of the matter with her, tell her it really doesn\u2019t even matter whether she accepts that it\u2019s an MLM. Stopping a party at someone else\u2019s house to make everyone listen to a sales pitch warrants getting kicked out on its own, no matter what. \n\nNTA", "NTA, obviously. The fact that you even let her finish her pitch was way more polite than I would have been. The gall to stop someone else\u2019s party, who you essentially don\u2019t know at all and at their house, to try and sell them a bunch of MLM bullshit is mind boggling.", "NTA.\n\nClaire seems to lack decency and manners, she\u2018s clearly TA and anyone who picked her side is, too.\n\nYou did the right thing, whereas Claire misbehaved like a spoiled teenager who only focuses on herself. She needs to grow up!", "NTA Your house, your rules. Also it is incredibly rude and entitled to set up shop without permission in another person\u2019s home to market stuff to the guests during the host\u2019s birthday party! \n\nI\u2019d block her on social media and your phone. She\u2019s trying to gaslight you into thinking you did something wrong when she\u2019s clearly an AH and quite possibly a scammer trying to suck people into a dubious scheme to enrich herself at others\u2019 expense.", "NTA. Don\u2019t humor cult members while they peddle shit that can ruin other peoples lives. If your husband understands what MLMs do and still thinks you\u2019re in the wrong then introduce him to his new home at Scientology and part ways.", "NTA\n\nYou were WAY nicer than I would have been.  As soon as I saw Claire\u2019s set up, I would have put an immediate stop to it, said that this was a social event, not a MLM party, and to put her wares away. Then I\u2019d have turned the music back on, and asked who wanted a drink.  \n\nClaire tried to take advantage of you having a bunch of people ove, and not being there to say \u201cNo\u201d when she decided to set up.  That makes Claire the AH. \n\nPlease go out on your local social media and let people know how she tried to hijack your social even, in your home, without your knowledge or permission.  That is key.", "NTA. And if MLMs are illegal, report her. Fuck her. She ruined your party. Anyone that sides w her is also an AH.", "NTA - Frankly as soon as you saw she was doing this MLM thing at your party, in your house, without your permission, she should have been asked to leave. I'd also suggest emailing everyone who was there the reason why this is a scam and to be careful...at least your friends, there are a ton of sources you can share which show why this is  a terrible idea. \n\nSource: Got sucked into AMWAY when I was a young adult. :'(", "NTA.  \nWhatever this woman was trying to sell is irrelevant.   No one should go to a party and highjack it to make sales pitch.", "It seems like you had a clear boundary that you communicated to Claire: you do not allow MLM sales in your house. Claire ignored that boundary and continued to try to sell her products and recruit people into her MLM. In this situation, it is completely understandable and appropriate for you to ask her to leave your house. You have the right to set boundaries and to have control over what activities take place in your own home.\r  \n\r  \nIt's understandable that your husband is upset that the situation became tense and unpleasant, but it is not fair for him to expect you to compromise your own boundaries and values to accommodate someone else's actions. It is important for him to respect and support your boundaries, rather than trying to pressure you into going against them.\r  \n\r  \nAs for the other guests at the party, it is understandable that they might be divided in their opinions on the matter. However, it is not your responsibility to convince them of your perspective. You have the right to make your own decisions and to communicate your boundaries clearly, regardless of whether others agree with you.\r  \n\r  \nOverall, it does not seem that you are in the wrong in this situation. You have the right to set boundaries and to have control over what happens in your own home, and it was appropriate for you to ask Claire to leave when she ignored those boundaries.", "NTA. Imagine having the nerve to ambush a whole party with a MLM sales pitch! And she's not even a close friend. I'd have kicked her out too.", "NTA. Fuck MLMs and the people who use the stupidest, most insensitive times to shove them down people's throats.", "NTA, that's absolutely nuts for her to do that. Apparently you also need to educate your husband on MLMs big time. I honestly would have kicked her and her scam the second she started.", "NTA\n\nClaire was completely out of order. I would have shut that down immediately.", "NTA. That's just crazy. You did nothing wrong.", "Nta\n\nYou'd be a terrible friend to your actual friends if you let her stay. The group people are defending her in are most likely people in the scam she is, and it's either her upline or downline.", "WTF, who hijacks someone's birthday party to sell shit? Your husband is so wrong about this. This woman is really out of line.\n\nNTA", "NTA  It's your house, your event - a party, not a sales pitch.  She highjacked a social event and you shut her down (eventually), as is your right.  Why anyone is taking her side is beyond me.  What's being left out of this story?", "NTA", "Nta. Screw mlms- you did everyone else a favor.", "NTA.  It's beyond presumptuous to sell anything at someone else's party, especially if your the guest of a guest...  SMH", "NTA \n\nWhat?\n\nIt\u2019s rude to \u201cannounce\u201d an announcement at someone else\u2019s occasion \n\nBut running a full business shop and making a profit for yourself is OK?\n\nWhat planet is she from?\n\nShe should have been  stopped from the second she turned the music off!", "NTA but your husband is for inviting people to a birthday party & blindsiding them with this nonsense. She should not have been allowed to even set up her shit.", "NTA- \nClaire is not going to make money in this scam... And if she does it will be by exploiting the people she recruits... Stoping her from preying on people in your home is the least you can do.", "NTA She hijacked a party, for her own ends, in someone else's house. Never cool.", "NTA.  I hate mlm too so I would be very annoyed if I were invited to a party and was hijacketed into the the mlm high pressure sales pitch.", "NTA in our country most of us know what they are...lowlives. I don't like that sort of nonsense.  Nothing but a great big ole scam. Nothing but a bug old racket.", "NTA. \n\nCan I be your friend ?? \n\nIf you had handled this in a different manner, she still would done the same thing by posting to groups. She knew what she was doing and had this planned, she knew your husband would agree and not you hence why she had waited until you left. You handled it as any person would, go you! Block her and never invite them over again.", "NTA. And what cheek to hijack a party to try and con the guests into signing up to an MLM scheme (which are vile things)!", "NTA, I\u2019ve met some Herbalife freaks in the past and you absolutely did the right thing. Those MLM nut jobs will sink their claws deep into people if you let them. I would\u2019ve shut that shit down as soon as I saw it, so props to you for having restraint lol\n\nOn the Facebook group, I think shit like that is hilarious. A miniature cult in the making getting upset at OP for calling them out is gold to me. I just hope they don\u2019t get too nasty for OP\u2019s sake.", "NTA. So tacky of her to hijack your gathering for her MLM crap.", "Tell her to f\u00a3$*\u00a5 off with her stupid business that she bring in your house without even asking permission! Remember her that you don\u2019t know each other and she should be ashamed by her attitude! You have no obligations to do anything for her so she must leave you alone! But if she continues you will go through legal way!! \n\nYou did right to stop her and if the people around you are to stupid to realize it , you can\u2019t help them! But it was a good move to stop her in her little play \ud83d\udc4d\n\nPs: your husband is a AH for allowing those people disrespect you in your own house! You are his wife and what his colleagues idiot partner have done is really disrespectful!!", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
