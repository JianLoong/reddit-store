She is engaged and wants kids down the road. At the time, my husband and I weren\u2019t intending to have more. I asked her about names and genders and stuff, and she told me what her ideal boy and girl names would be.\n\nI got pregnant unexpectedly last Christmas. My husband and I have first names that start with the same letter, so we carried that tradition on with our children. When we were trying to pick a name for the new baby, I mentioned the one my sister had picked for her potential future baby. My husband liked it too, so we decided to use it.\n\nMy sister and her partner have been upset with us ever since. I told her she knew we always pick names with that letter, and that it\u2019s too early for them to pick anyway. They\u2019re young, not married yet, and not planning on kids for a few years. She says she wouldn\u2019t have told me at all if she knew I might have another.

She told you the names because, at that time, you'd ruled out having children so she felt safe sharing this information. The nonsense about you always picking names with a certain letter is ridiculous; she probably would not have told you this name if she had known what she knows now.\n\n'We liked this one though because it isn\u2019t very common.'\n\nYea, she shouldn't have told you. Snake move.", "YTA.\n\nI can see why your sister feels betrayed and angry. There are SO many names in the world, you didn't have to pick the ones she wanted to use when she had confided that to you.  I feel bad for her and wish she'd never told you.  I think it's unlikely you would have picked that name if she hadn't told you it was her first choice.", "People like you are the reason why *I* keep my top name picks a secret from everyone but my spouse. Yikes\n\nYTA. You couldn't just let her have this, instead of swiping it for your unplanned bonus kid?", "YTA - People don't own names. But you picked a name knowing that it was your sister's first choice for when she has kids. It is not a name that you have any special connection to. You thought of it because she mentioned it. You even say in the comments that it is not a common name. That cannot be the only name left that starts with the letter you want. YTA for acting like she has no right to be upset about this.", "YTA, because you purposefully took your sister's option for her future kid. Sure, she doesn't have any kids now, but she told you what name she'd like to use, she confided in you. You just took it like that, which is sus.\n\nIF it had happened by accident and you didn't know her choice beforehand, it'd be NTA, but in this case, sorry YTA", "YTA\nEspecially if you hadn't considered that name before your sister mentioned it. She didn't own it, but using her idea that she told you to take it for your own is petty and needlessly confrontational. It might even harm the family relationships, and is it worth it?", "YTA , nope no one owns a name ,but your sister trusted you with what she wanted to use & then you decided to use it before her, it's basically the same as copying your sister in anything else , say like wanting the same wedding dress, wanting the same house etc, this was something special to her and you took it away, in my opinion that's not something a sibling should do.", "YTA, did you even try to find more names after you told your husband your sister prefered name?", "YTA, You didn't randomly pick this name.   You used hers.  It's just an AH move!", "Yeah, given the circumstances you describe, you're a bit of an AH. You didn't independently come to the idea that this was a good name - it occurred to you because your sister had mentioned it as her ideal future baby name. You did very much steal her idea.\n\nYTA", "YTA\n\nYes I know, nobody owns a name. But to deliberately go \"hey how about this uncommon name my sister loves and wants to use for her kid?\" is yikes. It wasnt something you had previously liked and picked out, or a family name, or or anything special to OP....it was a name her sister mentioned wanting to use only about a year ago.   I dont blame her sister at all for being upset. I would be too.", "What a snake. \n\nIt's people like you that make women keep their potential baby names a secret. Have fun with your sister never trusting you with any of her personal information!\n\nYTA", "YTA...You knew your sister liked it and wanted to use it. Sure she doesn't own it, but you're still kind of an asshole for not even offering consideration into her feelings. I guess if you like the name more than you like a relationship with your sister go for it. But don't be shocked when she suddenly doesn't trust you or want to have personal conversations with you.", "YTA.\n\nThese posts are always funny to me. You made a decision that you knew would upset your sister - come on. A year ago you asked your engaged sister, who was planning/hoping on having children with her fianc\u00e9e, what her \u201cideal\u201d baby names were. She gave you 2. Out of the hundreds of thousands of names to choose from, your sister listed 2 of them. \n\nShortly after this discussion, you get pregnant, and somehow out of those hundreds of thousands of names, **none** of them worked for you \u2026 so you said \u201chey husband, my sister told me she was going to use this name, should we use it?\u201d and the both of you decided that was a fantastic idea. And instead of just owning up to this - that you intentionally proposed using the name she planned to use, and that you and your husband decided you wanted to use it more than you cared about her feelings on it - you told her that despite having hundreds of thousands or even millions of names to choose from, you *had* to use this one because it began with a specific letter.\n\nLook, she doesn\u2019t *own* the name, and I don\u2019t think you did anything incredibly **evil** by wanting to use it. But you did something you knew would upset her. And trying to dance around that reality, pretending like you had no clue you were making a decision that would upset her, and insisting that you\u2019re not in the wrong because she shouldn\u2019t be worried about baby names since she isn\u2019t currently pregnant (when you literally *asked* her what names she wanted to use when she did have children) is AH behavior.", "YTA. You knew she wanted to use that name and you asked her about names, specifically soliciting the name she wanted. She is right she would not have told you if she knew you would be having another kid and/or had planned on stealing it.\n\nCongrats on ruining your relationship with your sister over a name you weren\u2019t interested in until she mentioned it. I hope she still uses the name later on and when people ask I hope she tells them exactly what you did.", "YTA yeah I think that sucks, you used a name you knew she wanted to pick \n\nSure people cannot claim names but I would be annoyed too", "YTA.", "Nobody owns a name. However, given the specific circumstances you have described?  YTA. You did this on purpose to spite your sister. Be a better person.", "YTA; what ya gonna do when your sister still chooses that name and let\u2019s everyone know you openly knew she liked it but still used it? 2 children with the same name will be fun for you to explain", "YTA, I would I could tell every woman in this world to NEVER share their desired baby names with friends or family members cause there are some snakes out there. You being one of them. You didn't have to do what you did but you did cause you don't give a f\\*ck about your sis. Yeah yeah I get no ones owns a name, but she told you trusting you that you would never use it. YTA!", "YTA\n\nAll the everyone sucks people are waaaaay off base. \n\nIf coincidentally OP picked the sister\u2019s secret choice for a baby name and the sister blew up about it she would be an asshole. \n\nOP was talking about kids with their sister when at the time they had no intention of having more kids. Sister was told they weren\u2019t having more kids. OP specifically asked their sister about the names she wanted to use. OP then decided to use the sister\u2019s top choice name for an \u201cunexpected pregnancy\u201d. Sister has every right to be pissed when their sibling knowingly stole the name she told them she wanted to use. Something OP only knew because they asked her to tell them. Yeah you can\u2019t own a name, but the sister isn\u2019t just pissed about the name. She\u2019s pissed because their sibling is this selfish and obtuse. Anyone who would think this is okay to do is probably an asshole the majority of the time.", "Dude come on. YTA. Why even ask? There are literally 10 billion names in the world and that's the one you have to have? Clear asshole here. You better ask yourself if you're willing to compromise your relationship with your sister over a name.", "Is your name Rachel?", "YTA cmon. You sound so ridiculous. No one owns a name but it\u2019s free to not be an AH. Your sister could get pregnant tomorrow if she wanted to. \n\nNow I hope she uses it despite you because she loves the name. Way to blow up this relationship over a name you didn\u2019t consider beforehand.", "YTA you explicitly had a conversation with your sister about names you both liked. Are you purposely trying to be mean?", "YTA - She should have known you will use her ideal baby name because you always pick names with that letter? When you first asked her her ideal baby names, I don\u2019t think she ever thought you\u2019d use them yourself. I would never think my sister is going use a name I\u2019d been planning to use. Maybe she had a special meaning or she had a reason for picking that certain name. Can I ask you how you chose your first child\u2019s name?", "YTA and if she names her future child the same thing you don't get to be angry", "YTA. You clearly did it on purpose. Don't be surprised if she still uses her chosen names for her future children. Not that they're likely to meet your family with the kind of relationship you're creating.", "YTA.\n\nNo one has a right to call dibs on a name, but it all comes down to respect.", "YTA. Yes she doesn't own the name but you chose to use a name that your sister told you was her choice for WHEN (not if) she has kids. That was a really shitty thing to do and definitely makes you an asshole.", "I love it that this person came to AITA expecting to get vindication, as the usual response is you can't own a name. But OP is so obviously YTA even in their own narrative that it backfired.", "YTA", "YTA. 100%. I\u2019d never talk to you again.", "My aunt stole the name my parents had picked out for me with my cousin who is about six months older than me. Their relationship has never completely recovered (not only for this reason). YTA and you know you did it on purpose.", "YTA.\n\nChoosing a baby name is ***usually*** something very personal, especially if it's a rare name.", "YTA- That was just flat our rude and inconsiderate. You knew her top name choice and went for it anyway? I'd be pissed too. I knew as a teen what I intended to name my future daughter. I was dead set on it and years later, I gave her that very name. Just because they are not pregnant now doesn't mean they gave up that name. Stealing it from your sister is just gross and inexcusable.", "YTA.  It was in your head because she mentioned it to you.  Thousands of names out there and you just had to pick the one she told you she preferred.", "YTA, you didn't come up with that independently and it has no sentimental meaning to you, you took it from the names she wanted. Yes, they don't have kids, but it's still a pretty AH thing to do.", "YTA\n\nIf this was some coincidence, like you two just happened to really like this name, then it\u2019d be another matter entirely. But you KNEW this name was her first pick when she was going to have kids, you deciding \u201cwell now it\u2019s mine now!\u201d Is pretty cruel on your part", "YTA obviously. I\u2019m not sure why you would think you aren\u2019t?", "I agree that no one \u201cowns\u201d a name and people can have the same name (so your sister can also name her kid that), but I do understand why she\u2019s upset about it. I think it\u2019s more of a trust issue at this point. (Mostly leaning towards YTA).\n\nEdit: clarification", "YTA of all the names you picked that one.", "YTA\n\nDude, your sister trusted you with the names she picked and you're just guna use it...because she isn't close to having a baby? gosh you TA.", "YTA. You talked to her, and knew she wanted to use it. There was no reason for you to pick it bc I\u2019m sure that wasn\u2019t the only name of whatever letter to choose. Just petty for no reason.", "YTA. \nYou are a horrible sibling. You literally knew that she wanted to name her kid that, so why couldn't you choose something else??? Pure selfish", "YTA \n\nYou know it will upset her and you are doing it anyway and trying to justify it because you know it\u2019s an ah move", "YTA, no one owns a name, but you literally stole the name she wants to use after she told you about it. You don\u2019t get to dictate when it is too early to pick a name. Her marital status and age are irrelevant. Hopefully she realizes she can still use it and does.", "YTA.\n\nMy brother is married with kids. My sister is married and thinking of trying to get pregnant soon. I am very single and no pregnancy prospects on the horizon. And yet my brother avoided and my sister refuses to pick the name I picked out for my daughter years and years ago because they give two shits about my feelings.\n\nNo one owns a name but being a good person means you don\u2019t take a name when someone you care about intends to use it.", "YTA full out. You KNEW that was the name she wanted one day and didn't care. You were extremely selfish and inconsiderate. She has every right to be upset with you. Id honestly never tell you anything of value again since you can't be trusted. Shame on you and your husband for that. You could pick any name with the same letter but did that. Ugh.", "YTA. I hope your sister uses the name anyway. That was so unkind. My SIL offered me her favourite girl name after she had two boys and wasn\u2019t having any more children. I didn\u2019t even consider it because I know she\u2019d have found it really hard.\n\nSure no one \u2018owns\u2019 a name and if she\u2019d never told you her first choice you\u2019d be in the clear, I can\u2019t believe you actively just took the name she loved the most because it started with a certain letter.\n\nThere are literally hundreds of names that begin with every letter of the alphabet.", "YTA\n\nNo one \"owns\" a name but you knew that this was something special to her. You got the idea to use it for your child from her. Seems an awful petty thing to do. Also, why use a name that would be tarnished....think in the future when your child wants to know where you came up with the name?  \"Well I heard your auntie say she wanted to name her child it and I liked it, got pregnant first, and the first letter matched....so we thought why the hell not\"", "What is the name out of curiosity? :)", "ESH.

Sure nobody \u2018owns\u2019 a name but you knew your sister wanted it and took it anyway.

You knew that your sister had her heart set on this name and you must have known she would be upset by it. \n\nI don't agree it's to early for them to have a preference in names yet. My husband and I had our hearts set on a boy and girl name before we even started trying. Those are the names we used for our kids. We never changed our minds.\nBut we also never told anyone for this exact reason.", "YTA who needs enemies with family like this", "YTA, I'm sure there are a lot of other uncommon names starting with that letter. Technically, yes, you can give your baby any name you like, but it's a thing of respect/decency towards your sister not to use the exact one she'd like to use for her child. I can understand her being upset.", "YTA. You were already self-centered and entitled. Now you\u2019ve proven that you\u2019re also untrustworthy and disloyal.", "YTA: You could have picked so many other names but chose hers, which was a shady move. You need to deeply reflect on what being a good sister and general person means. Think about honesty, integrity, loyalty, etc.", "YTA for sure. I hate people like you, you try to make excuses for why you chose that name \u201cour kids have names with the same first letter\u201d. Ok, that\u2019s awesome but you intentionally took a name your sister had picked out for her future child and by your own admission, you only tossed around a few other names so you made ZERO effort to choose a different name.", "YTA she doesn't have rights to it true but you did steal it from her.  I think you know it would hurt her and you went about doing it anyway.", "YTA, you knew she was planning on using that name for her child.    There are millions of names out there with what ever letter you picked.   This is the worst case scenario,  Your sister is never able to have kids and has to relive the pain every time your child is mentioned.", "YTA\nYou easily could have found a different name you liked. Hell, I\u2019ve got 5 kids and there are still hundreds more names out there that I like. What you did was a dick move. Just own it and stop trying to rationalize what you did.", "YTA there's so many names out there, you knew exactly what you were doing when you bought up the name to your husband.", "Wow, hard YTA. You clearly knew that your sister wanted it. You even asked. If you never talked about it and just by some stroke of coincidence, you just stumbled upon that name, I wont even consider you an A. But it was clearly done with bad intentions when you even thought of suggesting it to your husband. Hard YTa for this one.", "YTA. No one owns a name, but you should've at least asked her before using it. She may have all boys or all girls and not ever be able to use it herself, but the point is you stole something that was special to her and she trusted you with it.\n\nI don't have children yet, but my younger sister used my favorite boy name for my oldest niece. I love my niece but you bet your ass if I ever have a boy, I will use it. I've told her this.\n\nI hope your sister gets to use it anyway and when people ask (which they will), she tells them how you stole it and they judge you.", "YTA. You don\u2019t seem to mind you aren\u2019t close and this will definitely put the nail in the coffin on improving it.", "YTA - if you\u2019d come upon the name by happenstance sure, but you *knew* this was something your sister liked and did it all the same.\n\nHow would you feel if she did the same? And her youth has nothing to do with your actions. You\u2019d still be wrong not matter her age.", "YTA - hands down. This happened to me. I made the mistake of discussing baby names with my younger sister and she not only stole one, but TWO names. The first I was willing to let slide because it was a grandmother's name, and she used the nickname instead of her real name (like I was going to), so I decided I wasn't going to use the name since there was already someone named after her. The second time was infuriating! I had a girl name that used a favorite first name and my husband's name as the middle name (James). Not a common first name at all, I'm really picky about a name being unique/less common (not weird). Not only did she name her daughter that first name, but then used Jane as the middle name. I confronted her on it and she said she had no idea what I was talking about. We already had a rocky relationship before that, but I went no contact afterwards. She clearly doesn't respect me and doesn't value our relationship.\n\nAs far as the lame excuse of \"not married yet, not pregnant, etc\", I had another girl name picked out since high school. I wasn't actually ever even planning on getting married, but I thought, if I ever do and have a daughter, I love this name! You know what? I did get married and did have a daughter, and that is her name. Don't be an asshole. Seriously. This goes for friend's baby names too unless you don't value the friendship.", "YTA, damn. She told you what she wanted to name her kid, the name she\u2019s probably been calling HER kid in her head since she\u2019s been able to picture having kids , and you thought \u201coh much too nice for the sister I don\u2019t like\u201d while you can\u2019t own a name you shouldn\u2019t even have put it out for consideration, knowing it was \u201creserved\u201d\nMy brother and I both like the name \u201cRowan\u201d , but since he liked Rowan FIRST, told me its what he always pictured calling his child, I went \u201coh well, PLENTY of other strong , unique names\u201d and settled on one of the other BILLIONS OF NAMES.", "Info: Would you be upset if your sister still used that name when she gets pregnant?", "YTA. That's exactly why I didn't discuss baby names with anyone. Your sister shouldn't have trusted you.", "YTA and you know it.\n\nI'm wondering what story would you tell your kid about their name or why they don't have a relationship with their aunt and uncle.", "YTA, I think this is always an AH move to take names that others have told you they wanted to use for their own children.", "I mean\u2026 you couldn\u2019t ask her first?", "YTA, you couldve just searched for similar names", "YTA that's why I keep that a secret. Honestly.", "Of course YTA you are too dense to come up with your own baby name so you steal your sister\u2019s.", "YTA! Pick another name. You said you like it because it\u2019s uncommon.

She is engaged and wants kids down the road. At the time, my husband and I weren\u2019t intending to have more. I asked her about names and genders and stuff, and she told me what her ideal boy and girl names would be.\n\nI got pregnant unexpectedly last Christmas. My husband and I have first names that start with the same letter, so we carried that tradition on with our children. When we were trying to pick a name for the new baby, I mentioned the one my sister had picked for her potential future baby. My husband liked it too, so we decided to use it.\n\nMy sister and her partner have been upset with us ever since. I told her she knew we always pick names with that letter, and that it\u2019s too early for them to pick anyway. They\u2019re young, not married yet, and not planning on kids for a few years. She says she wouldn\u2019t have told me at all if she knew I might have another. AiTA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

By your own admission it is an unusual name & you give us no indication it was special in any way to you - you only wanted a certain first letter so likely had many other choices.\n\nIf I were your little sister, you would have to do some serious work to rebuild my trust before I would tell you anything meaningful ever again. So you have two choices now: make a sincere apology to your sister that shows you understand what you did and be willing to listen to what she needs to trust you again and do that consistently for as long as it takes or be OK with your sister acting like a polite stranger on the few future  occasions she is unable to avoid your company.

I hope she still names her kid that and explains why the cousins have the same name when people inevitably ask.", "And now your relationship will probably be non existent.", "Well you don\u2019t have one now, because YTA", "LOL it will be now and you deserve it.", "You sound exhausting and rude.", "I can't help but think that the reason yall aren't close has nothing to do with age...", "I wonder why...", "ESH, a billion names on the planet and you have to take the one your sister told you she wants. She sucks for trying to claim a name and being upset when her older sister took it. You for taking the name. If I were her, I\u2019d tell people what you did and then laugh about it because you\u2019re so unoriginal and jealous that this is the type of crap you pull. Mostly I pity you if this is the way you need to get attention or if you just wanted drama - sad.", "Now it will probably be nonexistent but congrats on getting your baby name.", "Your relationship is probably poor because your an asshole.", "That makes you even more of an AH.  You did this intentionally.", "Ya.  Imagine typing all this  out and  imagining she couldn't possibly be the AH, right?  LOL", "Adding to this, I know at least 2 families who did this with the first few kids but not the youngest. I always thought that was kinda asshole-ish.", "Unfortunately it happens more often than you think", "I wish these were fake! I read one just about every day. It's just disrespectful and tacky.", "Yeah but Rachel wasn't going to use the name even though she liked it because she's not an asshole. It was only after Monica gave her blessing to use the name that she named her daughter Emma.", "I was thinking a Duggar.", "YTA this exactly. And she definitely isn\u2019t going to tell her anything else from this point on. The sister has every right to be mad. This was childish on op\u2019s part.", "Yeah luckily for OPs sister, having a niece with the same first name as your child isn't that big a deal if you're totally estranged from that family.", "I can agree with that. That\u2019s just being completely left out of something that\u2019s basically tradition at that point. Either don\u2019t start it at all (preferred) or *at least* follow it through til the end.", "If it\u2019s real, I hope the sister has the guts to name their child the same name. And then tells *everybody* who asks exactly how her sister had an accident baby and was so unprepared she had to use the same name.", "Agreed 100%"]}
