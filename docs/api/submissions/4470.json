I\u2019m glad your husband supports you in this! Also kids can feel when they\u2019re being put under a microscope too so he would def pick up on her constantly analyzing him. He wouldn\u2019t necessarily understand it in that context, but I remember that I still had the feelings of feeling hovered and observed when I was little like that, for similar reasons.

I would be done with that woman if she said that to me", "NTA  I'm a special education teacher. You don't get to just get your kid into a class and doctors don't place children in classes, either. That's the district's decision. If a child is struggling in school, the school may do an assessment to see if it is due to one of the 13 qualifying eligibility categories for special education. If so, they will then do further assessment to see whether the child needs push and help in their regular education classroom, pull out help where they go to work with a special educator for a part of their week for intervention lessons, or whether they are completely unable to access education in the mainstream environment and need to be in an alternate environment.\n\nFor example, my daughter is autistic. She is 9 years old and she is just in regular classes. She gets 30 minutes of speech a week to work on articulation errors, but she accesses education just fine in the regular education environment so she doesn't require pull out or push in services and certainly doesn't require an alternate environment.\n\nUnless your child's school is trying to push for your child to be in a special day class and you are pushing back against it, the things that your SIL are saying make no sense and she doesn't understand special education.", "NO!!

I see this all the time in the hospital. A parent or family members will claim to be a nurse, but they\u2019re actually a CNA or a nursing student, and insist on arguing with the doctors about treatment for the patient. Their arguments are usually based on some WebMD ish and we have to calmly debunk their position. It\u2019s exhausting.\n\nI would absolutely bar this woman from contact with your kid.

It doesn't sound like she actually has any real reason to think this, which makes it extra weird to say. \n\nIf I genuinely thought one of my nieces or nephews needed extra help, I'd tell their parents and explain exactly what behaviours/mannerisms made me think that. For example, I have ADHD and I have noticed some significant similarities to me in one of my nieces behaviour. I've mentioned it to her parents but with the caveat that it doesn't necessarily mean anything, just wanted them to know so they can keep an eye out for other types of behaviours or challenges that could indicate a problem.", "OMG, I thought that your kid was special needs and she was saying you should put him in a special needs class, to which I'd be a little more N A H even if she was being blunt and rude about it, but with this info, definitely NTA.

In preschool students get into special education because their doctors are very very concerned and send them to early childhood clinics and ask them to get assessed in their local school district. Parents also can get very concerned and ask the school district to assess, but even then you're asking the district to make a determination; you're not making a determination yourself.
