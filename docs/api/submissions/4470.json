It's a touchy subject, that my wife has experience with in a professional setting. She works with developmentally delayed kids, but isn't qualified to make a diagnosis, just do treatment. From what she tells me, when they see signs of something, they ask the parent if they've talked about it with their pediatrician, as a sort of hint that, you need to talk about this with your pediatrician.  Once there's a diagnosis, doors open for qualifying for things.\n\nBut that's in a professional setting. She'd never even do that in a non-professional setting, unsolicited, let alone jump straight to saying a kid needs this or that.", "NTA please keep her away.

She's definitely overstepping, but to essentially cut her out from the family for making some insensitive remarks seems like going overboard. \n\nI might be missing something here though - is there a reason you think she would \"fill his head\" with stuff wrong with him? The folks I know like this would 1) say something to the parent and 2) use a more sensitive approach with him, which isn't necessarily bad and he likely won't notice. It doesn't sound like she's necessarily going to tell him things are wrong, because that would be incredibly strange for a special needs instructor to do to any child.", "I asked her why and she literally said idk.", "No she has a sub cert to teach and where we live they are so hard up for teachers they put her in the special needs classes to assist the teacher.", "My husband's step mother her mil says that I should put my feelings aside because of this aspect and that sil needs to be around him and is just treating my child like he's hers.", "I was shocked the day she said it she at first said idk\n We only see her on holidays she brought it up again during his bday and my mil was insulted and I asked why again she said it's her professional opinion.

My child's doctor has said he's progressing healthy and no developmental issues to be worried about.", "That is extremely unhealthy.

NTA, keep your child away from her, she might turn into dangerous behavior.", "Yeah you are correct it\u2019d be horrible for a child to be told theirs something wrong with them. I\u2019m glad your husband supports you in this! Also kids can feel when they\u2019re being put under a microscope too so he would def pick up on her constantly analyzing him. He wouldn\u2019t necessarily understand it in that context, but I remember that I still had the feelings of feeling hovered and observed when I was little like that, for similar reasons. Now I just know how to put the feelings into words", "Hard NTA then. Such a bizarre thing to say. Is she trying to insult you and/or your child? Is she trying to plug her classes? I would be done with that woman if she said that to me"]}
