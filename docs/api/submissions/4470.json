That's the district's decision. If a child is struggling in school, the school may do an assessment to see if it is due to one of the 13 qualifying eligibility categories for special education. If so, they will then do further assessment to see whether the child needs push and help in their regular education classroom, pull out help where they go to work with a special educator for a part of their week for intervention lessons, or whether they are completely unable to access education in the mainstream environment and need to be in an alternate environment.\n\nFor example, my daughter is autistic. She is 9 years old and she is just in regular classes. She gets 30 minutes of speech a week to work on articulation errors, but she accesses education just fine in the regular education environment so she doesn't require pull out or push in services and certainly doesn't require an alternate environment.\n\nUnless your child's school is trying to push for your child to be in a special day class and you are pushing back against it, the things that your SIL are saying make no sense and she doesn't understand special education.", "NO!!

The sheer audacity to diagnose a child", "NTA", "Yeah. I have a kid who has extra needs and quite frankly I would be more than a bit offended if kids of normal abilities started to take the extra resources my son and his class need for no good reason.\n\nAdditionally, if my son was completely average, I would be quite ticked off if some instant expert tried to tell me that they needed the extra help in class to cope. What a stupid woman.", "I had this the other day right here on reddit with a guy who'd read a DSM-5 page and told me, an experienced psych nurse, that I was terrible and he felt sorry for my patients and stuff like that. I couldn't even be bothered to roll my eye. Anyway, I don't usually diagnose but imo step-sil is looney and OP should definitely keep her kid away from her.", "Okay she is not mentally healthy. NC would be a good idea because I get the sense that she's fixated on you and your son. She really should not be around children until she gets therapy to deal with her issues. I'm sure they're related to her infertility."]}
