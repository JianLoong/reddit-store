Therapy may be a good place to start.", "NTA - especially from the comments you have made lower I managed to read.

I get that he has depression and I  get that he doesn't want to go to therapy because he was forced to as a teenager, but as an adult he is going to have to wake up and treat his depression (therapy/meds/etc) rather than just avoid it (videogames/denial).  \nYou can't force him to do that, but you can take yourself to a better situation. Stay with a friend or relative until you can get on your own  two feet solo. And when he calls asking you to come back, tell him, not until he's making significant strides in taking measures to work on  his mental health-- for your own and your daughter's future.", "NTA\n\nThis grown ass man just failed as a son, husband and father.

Run, don't walk, to a divorce lawyer nearest you.", "NTA. I can understand his situation slightly. I was unemployed and depressed for awhile and I played video games non stop that entire time since it was the only enjoyment and purpose I had. Difference being I didn\u2019t have responsibilities, he does and he needs to step up. Not only should you give him an ultimatum (and support) but his father should be as well. Get help for depression, get a job, and take care of his family or some other man will.", "Does he work? Any other hobbies? I need more info.", "NTA \n\nVideo game addiction is real, and a problem. And is not a cure to depression.\n\nIf he's behaving like an irresponsible teen, treat him like an irresponsible teen.", "NTA. Oh honey, this situation is a lot more common than you think. I have a lot of close friends in the group where they are gamers and they game excessively like this. 1 is a father to a young child (under the age of 2 years old) and exactly like how you described. The other guys aren't fathers yet, but I can't imagine them becoming fathers because I can see them pulling this kind of stunt. They all bitch about not having enough time to game - and it's like what 6pm till 2am isn't enough for you immature idiots? \n\nTheir responses are often like \"Well I got the chores done! What you complaining about?\" Okay... but its like you have other responsibilities such as spending time with your family, helping care for child (if you have one), trying to make more money (if you're financially struggling), etc. \n\nI wish I can do the favor for all the girls in the group and get a hammer to smash everyone's PS4/Xbox so they can mature & step it up. Gaming addiction is a serious problem especially with Millennial and Gen Z men. It is not spoken about enough and there needs to be more awareness. \n\nA few years ago, I used to tell my best friend that I refuse to ever date a gamer again after I had a bad experience with the last ex (he ditched spending time with me to go game and found himself a gamer girl to cheat on me with).

She could starve unnecessarily or be left in her own filth and get a serious medical infection or rash!)!\n\nDue to the neglect and abuse I've suffered (I have CPTSD), I'm well aquainted with being depressed and how that can affect a person's ability to function. Honestly his refusal to care for his daughter doesn't sound like depression to me, it sounds like his selfish desire to play his game undisturbed. Being depressed doesn't mean you don't have responsibilities you need to attend to, it just means it's a struggle to attend to them. What you've described isn't someone struggling to attend to a responsibility, but someone wrapped up in their own selfish world of gameplay! He's literally using it as a form of escape from reality, rather than a thing to do for personal enjoyment!\n\nHonestly if he keeps this up you should consider divorce! You are right in not trusting him to properly care for your daughter! If he cared about her properly, he'd put her needs first, no matter how much he was struggling to cope! He'd also to to a doctor to get antidepressants, perhaps also seeing a therapist, and he'd put the work in to heal himself (which actually does take a lot of work! Antidepressants aren't a cure, they're just a crutch you use to help you while you put in the hard work to improve your mental health!)!", "NTA.", "He's addicted.

So you are not the a-hole in this case, even if you blow up (though that doesn't really help, it's understandable). \n\nSuch an addiction stems from many issues, but the chief ones are having a poor diet - resulting in only enough energy for an activity as minimalistic as gaming-  and a lack of motivation to do anything else (which can be really exacerbated by a poor diet, as those nutrients also help fuel motivation).

If hes that the price tell him to get fucking therapy and if he refuses tell him to get the fuck out.", "Nta depressed ? Tell him to get therapy. You are raising 2 kids and this is not fair. You need to reflect on this and see if it is worth moving forward raising two kids or 1", "NTA.\n\nThere might be a more constructive way to approach this, but you are not obligated to parent an adult, and this can be a very frustrating experience so I understand losing it.", "NTA - I game a lot as does my husband but family comes first and neither of us have ever had to ask the other to stop playing since it is common sense to stop and pitch in smh", "NTA It sounds like your husband might have computer gaming addiction. Treat this addiction like any other kind. What would you do if he were an alcoholic etc?", "NTA.  When you have a baby, they come first. No ifs or buts. Utterly pathetic.\n\nHow does it even get to this stage. It sounds like you need serious convo re baby duties. Video gaming is fine, but it has to fit around actual life.", "NTA\n\nI spent 8yrs married to someone just like this and I eventually left with my kids. People like that just don't change or share the right priorities", "NTA  I can never get over how many posts there are like this, where a grown adult spends all their time gaming, to the neglect of their home, their partner, their CHILDREN.\n\nGlad you are opting to take a break from him.  I'm guessing you won't feel like it's any big loss.", "NTA\n\nI'm so sorry you and your little girl are in this situation.", "So he plays the video game until he wants to get laid and then goes back to it?\n\nNTA and you deserve a partner not a prick treating you like a fleshlight. Google bang-maid : you will not like what you read but it might make leaving his ass a whole lot easier for you.", "NTA. OP, my husband and I are both gamers, and it has never gotten in the way of taking care of our kids. When you become parents, gaming has to become a hobby that's done after the kids go to bed, and finishes early enough that you can parent the next morning.\n\nWalking away from this guy until he decides what's more important, his family or this game, is the way. It's become an addition. IF you're willing to come back, it should be only if he gets therapy and gets rid of his gaming system. If he's not willing to do this, don't fall for anything he says to convince you to come back, nothing will change.", "Lady I'm a lazy 20 year old on his winter break and even I'm not that lazy, please don't feel obligated to give him more chances just because of all the time you've spent on this relationship, you can find someone better.", "This is the right decision OP. Your daughter deserves a father who cares, you deserve a husband who cares. He doesn\u2019t care.", "Good for you!!! NTA", "This sounds like the right call for you and your child. He's got an addiction, and until he admits that, you're holding his ass from rock bottom.\n\nNTA", "Agree except for the \"some other man will\".", "I think she meant mw2 from 2022", "Happy cake day \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f best of luck", "He probably could benefit from therapy.  The problem is that you can't force someone else into therapy.  He needs consequences.  Either he will wake up and take some responsibility or you will be done taking care of him anyway", "Good decision to leave OP! Especially since he won\u2019t go to therapy or change his behavior. Your ability to get good sleep is IMPORTANT! Especially since you\u2019re basically a single mom.", "what does that stand for? i assumed it was the classic Modern Warfare 2 game. Now there is a new game with those same initialism and people are using the same initialism?", "Oh...this is a really good idea. I'll bet it'll definitely be the console though. Sad.", "She sells feet pictures on the internet as employment; I\u2019m sure if you look hard enough you can find her. You\u2019re probably right, her cocaine addiction and drunk driving accident after the breakup definitely screams that I was anything but stellar while working to provide us with everything.   Just reading your assumptions makes me doubt you would ever hold her accountable, luckily I did, because I\u2019m doing fine right now.  Enjoy your day.", "I think you should sit him down and have another conversation before you ask for a break.", "I think you should sit him down and have another conversation before you ask for a break.", "NTA - NTA - NTA.  I am sending you hugs and please stand firm on this issue - you should not feel alone especially with a grown man on your couch :)", "Info: have you left and are you safe?", "He needs to grow the hell up. Your family comes before anything else, and especially children\u2019s games no one should care about", "NTA..as all the other posters are saying...you need a break and he needs a kick to the nuts.", "Treat him like a teenager. Change wifi password or kidnap his pc/console cables, if he gives you AH treatment, he gets it as well.", "NTA", "NTA.\nDid his dad not say anything to him? \nHe might be playing because he is depressed but he needs to get help with that or deal with the consequences.", "NTA.\n\nIf he's depressed he should be seeking treatment. Anything else is a disservice to you.\n\nProbably over 50% of people I know are depressed, but they still get the fuck out of bed and do what needs to be done.", "I can\u2019t believe he wanted to just ignore the baby when she wakes up so he can finish his game. He is obviously not able to be a safe parent. PLEASE for the love of God, get out of there! Absolutely NTA. \n\nWill you please update for us? We\u2019re all rooting for you!", "NTA. What a jackass. Take the game and toss it out..with him.", "Bash the game in with a hammer", "NTA you don't have one kid you got two but one is fully grown while acting like a child.", "If you and I were Facebook friends, you could go back to 2011-2014 and read all of my posts about going to bed alone, doing things alone, being ALONE because of a damn PS3 \ud83d\ude02my ex-husband was obsessed and that\u2019s putting it mildly! I told him it was me or the video games\u2026I\u2019m sure you can guess by the dates that I left not long after that. He was in the Army and would wake up before PT to play, would come home for lunch and play, would play when he got home, up till bed\u2026it drove me INSANE! I definitely sympathize with you and know how frustrating that is\u2026hopefully he\u2019ll grow up one day soon!", "Definitely leave! You are a single mother already the only difference is you will have to pay for everything on your own. Does he even work? I also wouldnt be providing him with sex or sexual favors.", "It worked for Andy Murray\u2019s now wife. Good luck. Definitely NTA.", "I consider myself a gamer. My child is my priority. I\u2019d never game instead of being a present parent. Gaming is for downtime. When my child is asleep, when my husband isn\u2019t feeling neglected. When I\u2019ve finished a days work to contribute to my family. So many comments here saying he\u2019s a gamer and women don\u2019t get it? Such sexist nonsense.", "The post literally says he\u2019s not contributing with their child, is missing family appointments because he\u2019s sleeping in, it\u2019s affecting his and his wife\u2019s physical relationship, he\u2019s snapping at her and he\u2019s depressed. The fact it\u2019s a video game vs any other hobby is irrelevant, as is the fact she\u2019s female and he\u2019s male.", ">females\n\nAnd you instantly made anything you say irrelevant.", "Then they shouldn't have made a baby.", "Okay, that's his problem. At least she and the baby will be safe and happy.", "Then he can go to his GP.", "That's how serious gaming addiction is. It's just as bad as alcohol addiction or drug addiction. The three are comparable and typically people resort to these 3 things because they're escaping from something in their lives. You have to face your problems head on and not rely on something (whether games, drugs, alcohol). In order to start recovery, you need to toss the thing (whether gaming system, alcohol, drug) out to help the addict with resisting temptation initially until they go through appropriate therapy and treatment. \n\nWith these guys, I suspect they have a case of Peter Pan Syndrome. It's a psychology term where they have difficulty growing up so they engage in child-ish shit and shirk responsibilities. With some guys, they can do some responsibilities but will do the bare min & avoid seeking additional responsibilities. As an adult, that desire should be there that you WANT to get better jobs, that you WANT better income, that you WANT a better life, that you WANT to have a family, etc. If that desire isn't there, that adult is just a grown up child.", "This was my ex.", "You\u2019re a child. Literally. \n\nA. Unlink your social media accounts. You have no reason to have your Facebook with your first and last name attached to a Reddit account. \n\nAnd B. You have no goddamn idea how stressful it is to be working every second you can just to afford power and food while your adult husband sits at home doing nothing. No chores. No job. No helping with baby. Nothing. Depression is not an excuse for being deadweight. And people can only take so much. It\u2019s been months. He needs to step up regardless of his mental health.", "This sounds so much like my ex boyfriend. He barely worked and would spend all day/into the night playing computer games. I'd come home from work to an apartment that was disgusting. I asked him so many times to please just help out with cleaning because it wasn't fair being saddled with it all the time. He might do it for a day or two but then slide back into being basically useless. Then he'd be all hurt when I didn't want to have sex with him. I stopped being attracted to him, in large part because of how comfortable he was with letting me bear the brunt of taking care of where we both lived.", "This. So much this. Thank you"]}
