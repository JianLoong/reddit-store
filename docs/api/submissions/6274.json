Thank you", "NTA\n\nA lot of video games measure the amount of time you spent playing it.\n\nYou can use that to show him how he has been spending way too much time on the game and maybe come to an agreement of say he can play for x hours a day or week where he gets his fix and it doesn't disrupt your life.\n\nBut yes feels like he is addicted here and needs to break free from that addiction.", "NTA - screen time and time spent indoors is proven to increase stress and anxiety. He needs to shut it down and go outside. Video games are not real life and he needs to step up and be a husband and a dad. Therapy may be a good place to start.", "NTA - especially from the comments you have made lower I managed to read. He is a teen addicted to games and wants to responsibility even though he has a child. \n\nI agree some people over demonise gaming.

I get that he has depression and I  get that he doesn't want to go to therapy because he was forced to as a teenager, but as an adult he is going to have to wake up and treat his depression (therapy/meds/etc) rather than just avoid it (videogames/denial).  \nYou can't force him to do that, but you can take yourself to a better situation. Stay with a friend or relative until you can get on your own  two feet solo. And when he calls asking you to come back, tell him, not until he's making significant strides in taking measures to work on  his mental health-- for your own and your daughter's future.", "NTA\n\nThis grown ass man just failed as a son, husband and father.

You are a video game widow watching your husband's brain rot. He has no job, no hobbies, he's refusing therapy for depression, he's refusing to step up to his responsibilities as a family man, and you're on the verge of eviction. Run, don't walk, to a divorce lawyer nearest you.", "NTA. I can understand his situation slightly. I was unemployed and depressed for awhile and I played video games non stop that entire time since it was the only enjoyment and purpose I had. Difference being I didn\u2019t have responsibilities, he does and he needs to step up. Not only should you give him an ultimatum (and support) but his father should be as well. Get help for depression, get a job, and take care of his family or some other man will.", "Does he work? Any other hobbies? I need more info.", "NTA \n\nVideo game addiction is real, and a problem. And is not a cure to depression.\n\nIf he's behaving like an irresponsible teen, treat him like an irresponsible teen.", "NTA. Oh honey, this situation is a lot more common than you think. I have a lot of close friends in the group where they are gamers and they game excessively like this. 1 is a father to a young child (under the age of 2 years old) and exactly like how you described. The other guys aren't fathers yet, but I can't imagine them becoming fathers because I can see them pulling this kind of stunt. They all bitch about not having enough time to game - and it's like what 6pm till 2am isn't enough for you immature idiots? \n\nTheir responses are often like \"Well I got the chores done! What you complaining about?\" Okay... but its like you have other responsibilities such as spending time with your family, helping care for child (if you have one), trying to make more money (if you're financially struggling), etc. \n\nI wish I can do the favor for all the girls in the group and get a hammer to smash everyone's PS4/Xbox so they can mature & step it up. Gaming addiction is a serious problem especially with Millennial and Gen Z men. It is not spoken about enough and there needs to be more awareness. \n\nA few years ago, I used to tell my best friend that I refuse to ever date a gamer again after I had a bad experience with the last ex (he ditched spending time with me to go game and found himself a gamer girl to cheat on me with).

She could starve unnecessarily or be left in her own filth and get a serious medical infection or rash!)!\n\nDue to the neglect and abuse I've suffered (I have CPTSD), I'm well aquainted with being depressed and how that can affect a person's ability to function. Honestly his refusal to care for his daughter doesn't sound like depression to me, it sounds like his selfish desire to play his game undisturbed. Being depressed doesn't mean you don't have responsibilities you need to attend to, it just means it's a struggle to attend to them. What you've described isn't someone struggling to attend to a responsibility, but someone wrapped up in their own selfish world of gameplay! He's literally using it as a form of escape from reality, rather than a thing to do for personal enjoyment!\n\nHonestly if he keeps this up you should consider divorce! You are right in not trusting him to properly care for your daughter! If he cared about her properly, he'd put her needs first, no matter how much he was struggling to cope! He'd also to to a doctor to get antidepressants, perhaps also seeing a therapist, and he'd put the work in to heal himself (which actually does take a lot of work! Antidepressants aren't a cure, they're just a crutch you use to help you while you put in the hard work to improve your mental health!)!", "NTA.", "He's addicted.

So you are not the a-hole in this case, even if you blow up (though that doesn't really help, it's understandable). \n\nSuch an addiction stems from many issues, but the chief ones are having a poor diet - resulting in only enough energy for an activity as minimalistic as gaming-  and a lack of motivation to do anything else (which can be really exacerbated by a poor diet, as those nutrients also help fuel motivation).
