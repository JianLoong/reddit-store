I talked to his parents quite early on and thought they were good people, they were both well-educated and had degrees, with his father (49) being a doctor and his mother (38) an optometrist, and they were very positive about our early marriage.\n\nLast year, MIL began sending me baby videos, which I thought was really weird since I was just 17 and at this time my husband was still 16. I didn't know how to respond so I said they were cute and left it at that. Thought the year, she would continue to repeatedly send me these baby videos, even after I began to express feeling uncomfortable by them and that I was way too young to even think about having children. Whenever I told her I felt this way, she told me my mind would change when I'm married.\n\nA few day's before the wedding, MIL and her mum took me out shopping in a bigger city, where there was a shop for exclusively baby wear. We were out shopping for last-minute wedding preparations, like ribbon to put around the flower bouquets so, of course, this wasn't the reason we went. When I saw the baby shop I tried to walk past it quickly but my MIL already went in which caused her mum to follow her in too. I didn't know how long they were going to be in there so I followed them in too, although I knew that this would lead to a conversation about me having a baby.\n\nSure enough, it did. MIL kept pointing out baby clothes or baby shoes and loudly saying things like 'oh if only we had a baby to put that on' or 'I can't wait to buy all these cute clothes for a baby'. I was getting mildly annoyed because I'd made it very clear that I wasn't ready or wanting to have a baby and so I told her why doesn't she just have one.\n\nThis really rubbed her the wrong way and she started causing a bit of a scene in the middle of the store (albeit I think there were only 3 other people there), saying how she had a kid really young and how it was a woman's duty to provide children for their husbands. My husband's grandmother didn't speak but she nodded along at some of the things MIL was saying.\n\nI ended up leaving the store on my own and catching 2 buses to get home. I've been avoiding MIL and her mum since. My husband is mad at me, he doesn't think they've done anything wrong and that I've just misunderstood what they've been trying to say.

When we got married, his mom kept pressuring us about having a kid even though we didn\u2019t want one. We went on an extended vacation with her a couple of years after we got married. She was acting super weird the whole time and being really nice. She was making my meals and lots of smoothies. During the vacation, I lost my birth control and couldn\u2019t find it. When we were packing, I opened her drawer, and I found it in her room. I found crushed prenatal vitamins, and I found herbal fertility smoothies\n\n\u201cI was hysterical and took a pregnancy test. I ended up finding out I was pregnant, and I cannot tell you how mad I was at her. We kept the baby and filed a restraining order against her. Looking back, I was really stupid and should have been more wary. I love my kid, but I wish I had gotten to wait until I was older to have him. Most moms won\u2019t be this wild, but just remember, if they don\u2019t respect your little boundaries, they won't respect any.\"\n\nPlease be careful with him and his family. NTA", "This is going to sound completely paranoid, but keep your birth control in a safe place your new husband doesn't know about. Also, use condoms that you are in charge of. \n\n If he sees nothing wrong with his mother trying to turn you into a baby factory, they may convince him to mess with your bc or the condoms. \n\nYour husband needs to tell his mother to butt out now. Or you will end up in a situation where they tell you how to parent your own kids. \n\nWhen 2 people get married, their parents are no longer their immediate family. Their spouse is. Alot of people have trouble understanding this concept. Your Monster-in-law got to have her family the way she wanted. \n\nYOU should get to do the same. And if your husband won't back you. There is nothing wrong with a divorce or an annulment. It's better to be single than have people tell you how you're going to live your life. It's YOUR LIFE.", "NTA.
