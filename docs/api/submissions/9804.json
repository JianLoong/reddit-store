I'm not the strict \"everything needs to be my way\" kind of teacher, but administration has a very strict policy for students outside of classrooms during class periods.\n\nI asked his parents to come in so we could discuss it, to try to get them to help me figure out a way to get him to follow this rule. They arrived and seemed like fine enough people, but then saw my photo on my desk of myself (28m) and my husband (31M) they asked who it was and I was honest, it has never been an issue before. They later called the school to report me for \"inappropriate behavior in the classroom\" mind you I do not talk about my husband in class, I am there to teach, not preach lol. \n\nAdministration is definitely with me on this, but honestly they have started sending some really rude emails to my school provided account and I would like to honor their wishes that their child not be \"exposed\" to my \"disgusting lifestyle\"\n\nI may be the asshole here because as good of a student as he is I just no longer feel comfortable with him in my class, he loves art class and there are no other art teachers at the school so he'd be removed from the course entirely which I know isn't fair to him.

Unfortunately, the only person who will really be affected by their madness is their child. And I don\u2019t see how having a picture of yourself with your husband is so wrong. Unless you\u2019re naked on a bed with him.", "This is something for the school administration to handle. You should not have to put up with this kind of harassment. They need to make it stop one way or another.\n\nEDIT: I read your comments about not feeling safe now. Your school and maybe the other parents need to have your back here. If they are already making a public issue of it, you might want to get police involved too.", "NTA, but the school may not be able to remove him entirely, so I would advocate for another adult to be present in the room when you teach his class. You should also insist that any further communication should go through administration. \n\nHis parents are already making false allegations, and if the administration is not willing to address their behavior, they at least need to take steps to protect you professionally. \n\nA lot of the y t a and e s h comments are ignoring the very real danger that the parents\u2019 behavior could be to your career and livelihood. Of course you don\u2019t want to punish a child, but if given the choice between your career and a child being in your class, there is nothing wrong with protecting yourself.", "NTA. But the administration should be doing more to deal with them.\n\nI lot of parents homeschool their kids to keep them from being exposed to anything they do not approve of.  The actual education is secondary.\n\nIf yours school's backing is strong enough they may withdraw him.  Sucks for the kid though.", "NTA, the parents made it clear they are going to antagonize you until he is removed, you'll both be happier. It's too bad for the kid because you'd probably be a great influence but for your own peace of mind, but it's not worth the misery.", "NTA. I would recommend that you make sure that you are never alone with the child in case his parents try to claim that you engaged in inappropriate behavior. If the child wants to speak with you alone, make sure the principal or another teacher is present.", "NTA. Ever wonder why he was home schooled in the first place?", "Speak to a lawyer.", "NTA- Either way we know your Job is safe, but you shouldn't have to put up with harassment. Before removing a good student from class, I would attempt to use the schools resources to have an OOP filed against the parents.", "NTA here, you need to protect yourself here. Do not expect too much from the school. They tend to bend to parents. First and foremost you probably just need to report these emails to the police and see if you can get a tro. Are we talking about a small private school or an actual district. Either way, there should be a governing body they will eventually escalate this to which more than likely won't be good for you as I stated earlier schools ultimately always tend to bend to parents and generally the most horrible of parents that pops up out of the woodwork.", "NTA;  This kid's parents suck and it isn't your fault.  With them outwardly hostile towards you, you cannot provide their child a safe environment for education.  Your employment and safety may be threatened.  Suck for the kid who is the victim of his parent's prejudice.", "If they don\u2019t want their son to be in your class because you are gay then they need to be adults and tell the school to switch his class instead of sending you hateful, homophobic emails. To be honest the school should have already moved him given that they know about the parents behavior. I worry that if you request he be removed his parents will feel like they have \u201cwon\u201d and that\u2019s not fair to you. Let the kids parents be the \u201cbad guys.\u201d My judgement is NTA and I feel sad for both you and your student.", "NTA. They don't want you teaching their kid and you aren't comfortable teaching him anymore. Hopefully they can find him an online lesson or something similar or at least give him supplies to keep going on his own - if they were previously homeschooling him they should be able to find him some way of doing it on his own.", "NTA - you a teacher and you are allowed to protect yourself from an abusive environment.  It sucks that the kid gets punished by being removed but either the school steps up and provides you more support or you protect yourself", "Honestly it's tough to make a judgment here. You're NTA, but neither is the kid, and you having him removed from your class is taking away a fantastic opportunity for growth for him. \n\nIs it possible for you to have these emails redirected by the school's IT department? Perhaps someone in the administration can step in and screen these emails for you, or the parents can be told that they must contact the administration with any concerns instead of reaching out directly to you? On that note, are you even sure that these emails will stop if you have the kid removed, or are these parents going to keep harassing you or the school about you?\n\nUltimately, I get it. I wouldn't want to be in an environment where I'm being degraded like that either, and if you choose to have the kid removed I can't blame you.", "INFO: Could you simply block the parents emails and force them to communicate directly with administration, rather than with you?", "NTA, with some conditions. \n\nListen, as a former teacher, I get what a nightmare some parents can be. Have you brought the harassing emails to administration's attention? What was their response? Because, honestly, they should be the ones handling this. There needs to be a clear line drawn by administration that administration will NOT be firing you and that the parents either have the choice to remove their child from your class or keep him in art and keep their mouths (and computers) shut. \n\nHowever, if the parents decide to keep their mouths shut, then the young man should be allowed to stay in your class. It's not his fault, and he shouldn't be punished for the actions of other people.\n\nSo, here's my final decree: Your administration is TA if they won't take a firm stance with TA parents of this student. However, YWBTA if you insist the student be removed if his parents back off.", "NTA\n\nSorry for the kid, but his parents are the cause of him being removed from class.", "NTA, and I'm sorry this is happening to you. The administration should attack this problem head-on and make supporting statements against these rumors. Can you file a police report for harassment and defamation?", "NTA These people will do ANYTHING to manufacture a reason to get you in trouble. That would leave all your students without a teacher. Protect yourself for all your students' sakes.", "YWNBTA for requesting that the child be removed from your class, so long as you have exhausted all other options in dealing with the parents. You are not \u2018punishing\u2018 him, and your safety\u2014 emotional and physical\u2014 need to be prioritised over his feelings. It\u2019s a shame that he loves art and that there are no other teachers to go to, but that\u2019s on his parents, not you: both you and the boy are their victims. Having said that, he may not be able to be removed if art is a mandated part of the curriculum in your area.\n\nIn my country, parental behaviour like this is generally strictly regulated\u2014 not just through the union (though that\u2019s one avenue), but through our OH & S (occupational health and safety) laws. I don\u2019t know if this is an option where you are, but in cases of harassment here our admin will often develop protocols for the parents: e.g. they must not have direct contact with you and are only allowed to email the prin, etc. Having admin field their nonsense would at least resolve the in-school issues without necessitating the boy\u2019s removal. Outside of school is harder, obviously, if they escalate to that point\u2014 I would think this aspect is an issue to discuss with your union, police, a free/low-cost legal advice service in your state, or even contacting an lgbt+ advisory service. If you\u2019re in the US, Lambda Legal also outlines your protections on a state-by-state basis, including ones specific to schools: [https://www.lambdalegal.org/](https://www.lambdalegal.org/) .\n\n(Also, if you\u2019re not already, *document everything).*\n\nEdit: first paragraph, for clarity.", "The parents seem like absolutely horrible people and it\u2019s terrible how they abuse you. Also, if straight teachers have the right to have photos of their families then so do you. The whole movement against queer teachers is quite frankly deeply disturbing.\n\nHowever, I\u2019m going with YWBTA. You shouldn\u2019t punish the kid for having terrible parents. The child has probably been brainwashed from their home schooling. So being a positive gay role model in their life will probably be a good thing that can counteract the brainwashing. Get your revenge by giving the kid the best time ever in art class, so amazing he never wants to leave. Become his favourite teacher. Hopefully then he will never want to go back to homeschooling and exposure to the wider world will make him realize what awful parents he has.\n\nIn the meantime, is it possible to block their emails and have the school mediate communication with a parent through a third-party so you don\u2019t have to deal with them directly?", "ESH - don't punish a kid for their parents. Work with the school to manage your boundaries and wellbeing, but don't exclude a kid for their parents bad behaviour.", "Ooof ok meeting with parents is not how any teachers I know would address the bathroom thing. You tell him, then the principal tells him, then administration contacts the parents if it is a school rule not an art class issue. And the initial parent contact would be an email or phone call opposed to an in person meeting. Did administration request that you meet with the parents or was that your call? Obviously these parents are horrible terrible people but you invited them into the whole situation when it was decided the bathroom situation could not be handled in school and the parents needed to be brought in. Ultimately you should not punish the kid bc of the parents block their email or collect them for a harassment case. YWBTA if ur only solution is to dump the kid.", "Ywbta as you don't punish a child for the parent's behavior. But it seems likely with what you claim is occurring that the parents would have already asked he be removed,  yes?", "YWBTA. \n\nThe child is not their parents' terrible choices. Let your administration deal with this. \n\nChances are, the parents will remove the child on their own, it's a shame if they do, but then you're not the AH.\n\nAlso, if the parents remove the child, the child is more likely to oppose the parents and their way of thinking. If you get the child removed, it's all the more likely the child thinks \"maybe mom and dad are right\".", "Ywbta if you punish a child for their parents behavior. It seems at this point the parents are the sort who would continue, possibly more if you removed their child.\n\nYour school district has the ability to protect you, even if small. Save any evidence, show the principal and school board. Then tell them you need to block these people, for your safety.\n\nIf they disagree then consult a lawyer. I understand being low income and worried, but a lot of people in the field of law do pro Bono work and will direct you to someone who can do that. Especially in relation to hate speech/attacks on someone who is a LGBT minority.\n\nDon't make the kids life any worse, he is also a victim here and likely is treated badly at home. Defend yourself and his need to be around other people his age/different than him.", "NTA for disliking the parents and their attitude towards youm YWBTA if you remove the child. He likes your class, and he doesn't give you problems. He more than likely doesn't even care about your sexuality.Go to your admin, have them present for any meetings between yourself and the parent and CC your admin in any email you may send to them. Also, I'm assuming you do this already via lesson plans (assuming they're required for you), document what you're teaching so they can't go against you with some wild claim that you're grooming their child.\n\nIt's the parents fault that they're being ignorant. The kid is just trying to have fun in a class he enjoys. Don't take your issues with the parent out on the kid if he's genuinely a good student- all that's going to do is; 1. Make him feel like he did something wrong or 2. Make him dislike you and reinforce his parents ideals.\n\nEdit (after reading some replies in the comments): your school board should have a team of lawyers at hand, if not one assigned to your school.  If they are threatening you, especially via email or any sort of written method, take these issues to the school board, with evidence, and seek legal advice.", "ESH, if you get the child removed. It wouldn't be fair to punish the child for their parents behavior. You can show this child that his parents are wrong by being accepting of him. Talk to the principal and other staff members and create a plan to address the child's behaviors. He clearly wants a public education and may already know his parents views are problematic.", "YWBTA it's not his fault that he has awful parents.
