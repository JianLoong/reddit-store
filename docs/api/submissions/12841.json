She has always been the most important person in my life, and I owe her so much. She's had a very tough life but despite this never fails to be the nicest and most giving person. In 2016 myself and 2 of my brothers bought her a small house. It was a bit of a fixer upper, and we spent a year on/off renovating it into a dream house for her.\n\nShe lives there now with her youngest 2 children (13M/15F) and our autistic brother (43M). She has been dating her boyfriend for around 10 months. None of our family like this man and he is a massive loser. He is an old friend of one of our brothers that OD'd and died almost a decade ago. This man is also an addict, spent time in prison, and is a deadbeat dad to his daughters. We all want her to end things with him, but she seems very in love. We don't just blindly hate the man but are actually concerned with her having him in her life. She is 10+ years sober and his influence could cause her to relapse, she has a history of dating/marrying abusive men, and most importantly I don't want him around my niece/nephew and her grandkids.\n\nOn Saturday, my sister told me that he was going to move in with her because he is getting kicked out of his apartment (they won't let him renew his lease). I instinctively told her that it was a bad idea and that I see things ending badly. She blew me off and changed the subject, so I let it go for the moment. I texted her youngest son later and asked him what he thought and if he was okay with it. He essentially said no and that he did not like the guy.\n\nI also contacted my other brothers that I co-bought the house with, and they were also unhappy she was inviting him to move in. They agreed that I could tell her as owners of the house that he cannot move in with her. I told her this yesterday and she was unhappy and told me I was overstepping and interfering with her life. I gave her my reasons and told her we just wanted to protect her and her kids. She asked me how I would stop her from moving him in and I threatened that I would call CPS and tell them she was allowing an addict to live with her children. For good measure, my cousin and I went to where her boyfriend drinks and told him he wasn't going to be moving in.\n\nMy younger sister called me last night to berate me for banning this man from moving in and told me I was using the excuse of protecting our sister to actually control her life. She thinks me and my brothers are asses for using something nice we did for her as a tool now to interfere with her life. My younger sister has only met the boyfriend once, whereas my brothers and I have known him for years and know what he is like. She is really only going of information our sister told her.

Accept your decision or move out and pay her own way if she must be with him.\n\nNTA", "NTA You know, I don\u2019t care if you\u2019re overstepping. Bringing any guy to move in with her 2 minor children after she\u2019s only been dating him for 10 months is a mistake. That he is a known addict makes him dangerous to the kids. That he\u2019s kicked out of his apartment means that she\u2019ll be supporting him. When the relationship goes to hell, it\u2019ll be on you to get him out because it\u2019s your house. \n\nMaybe you\u2019re a jerk for pulling the \u201cmy house, my rules\u201d card on your sister. I understand why she feels that way, but she can wait until her kids are gone to ruin her life.", "NTA - Based on your post your sister is not paying rent, you and your brothers are simply letting her live there.  This is your house and you have every right to control who lives there.  Please continue to protect your nephew and (in spite of herself) your sister from this loser.  If she's that deadset on living with him, she can go do so in someone else's property.", "I\u2019m going with NTA. Essentially you are her landlord. If she was renting from someone else she couldn\u2019t just let new people move in without adjusting the lease. They would likely do a background check and possibly deny it because of his history, and they would have the right to do that.", "NTA. I've yet to see a situation in this sub like your sister's that ended well. Bringing in this guy with her teen children won't be peachy. At all. \n\nSo, \"where her boyfriend drinks\". Is it a bar, a back alley, under a tree in the park? Ngl, that part cmu.", "NTA, primarily because you're protecting her kids from being subjected to living with this guy. If there were no kids involved, I'd say you can't protect somebody from making bad life choices.", "NTA. You and your brothers own the house, therefore you have the right to not allow the boyfriend to live there without your consent. He sounds like a walking liability, so I totally understand your desire to keep him out of there. I also think your desire to protect the kids is admirable. While I understand your sister\u2019s sentiment that she feels like you\u2019re controlling her life (which you sort of are), in this case I\u2019ll give you a pass. You aren\u2019t restricting her from seeing him, you\u2019re just not permitting him to live in a house that you own. If she wants to live with the boyfriend so badly, she can find and pay for her own place to live that isn\u2019t owned by you.", "NTA. First, you and your brothers are her landlords. Landlords get final say on who lives in the house. All three of you agree that the addict bf is not moving in. Second, your autistic adult brother also lives there. Im assuming that a condition of her living there is that she provides a certain level care for him. Moving bf in will cause a disruption to his routine and might cause her to be dustracted.", "NTA So many reasons why. You and your family put money into the house. If I am incorrect, let me know, the house is in your names? Drug use at a home can cause house to be lost. I have seen this happen where I live. I have seen houses be deemed damaged because of drugs done in the house. Biohazard and very costly repairs. Your autistic brother lives there. His safety and wellbeing are also an issue. If your sister has relapsed after 10+ years of sobriety, has a history of entering bad relationships, and you all know the guy isn\u2019t going to contribute to the household, why risk someone like this moving in YOUR property. That sounds harsh, but it is your responsibility. It is a lousy situation, but too much of a gamble.", "NTA\n\nThis isn't about control. This is about the safety of your sister, her children and your brother who also live in the house.\n\nThere is a REASON his last housing was not renewed.", "You are overstepping.

My sister was struggling with sobriety and trying to divorce her addict husband. She made it 100 days before he brought drugs home and she died. So ya....NTA", "NTA\n\nYou and your siblings are already beyond kind in letting your sister, who is an addict, and her kids stay in the house. \n\nContinue to remind her who owns the home and that CPS is just phone call away\u2026.", "Info\n\nDo you pay the homeowners insurance? \nDoes she have a lease?", "NTA, protect those children", "I  don't think you are an AH.  If you are an AH, so am I. If your sister wants to be an independent adult, she is free to move out.  Dependence always has a price.  This one doesn't seem to be too high, in my opinion.  \n\nShe may not like it, but she can move out.  You might have some difficulty around what to do with the autistic brother if she does.", "NTA. This is why you don't mix family and finances. Easily leads to breakdowns in the relationships. If it is your home, you decide who lives there. End of discussion. You may fracture your relationship with your sister(s), but that's the cold truth. \n\nShe leaned on you guys to live comfortably, and now she's mad at the responsibilities that come with that.", "Nta. She can move out if she wants to be with him.", "NTA. Your sister can do whatever she wants with her life but there are kids involved that live there and don\u2019t want this guy to move in. You have every reason to be concerned, although unfortunately I feel like this type of moves usually make the person get even closer to the boyfriend you wish she would get rid off, so it might end up backfiring. It\u2019s a tough situation for sure, but I can hardly blame you for trying to stop the trainwreck.", "NTA but my reasoning is you are protecting her children and your brother from a potentially very bad situation. Once he's in it is going to be hard to get him out. I really think you ha e the right to take this stance.", "Your little sister shouldn\u2019t have a problem letting this guy move in with her then.", "NTA. You are being controlling and overstepping, but I would do the exact same thing if I was in your situation. Since she has minor kids in the house I think your reaction is fair. But this is why you never mix family and money.", "INFO: Is she living with your autistic brother as his caretaker? Is he fully functioning on the Autism spectrum?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI only ask because that's a huge burden that limits her ability to go out and meet people. Sometimes people end up dating other people out of loneliness and convenience. If she is sole caretaker to your brother, then it explains her being with this guy, to a degree. It's hard to resist what is easy and available when you're lonely", "NTA, he is not overstepping as a landlord. Landlords have the right to vet their tenants, the bf didn't pass the background check. She is free to find alternate accommodations that will accommodate the bf in the same way the landlord can chose the tenants.\nMaybe you should ask your younger sister to provide them with housing.", "NTA\n\nShe's trying to make shitty choices with two kids' lives at stake and wants to move an addict in with them when she is a recovering addict. That will never end well. So in this no win scenario, you are making the best of the bad choices by using your power as landlord to stop this loser from moving in.", "NTA.  Your sister is your tenant; if this guy moves in then he will become your tenant.  You will then have to evict him in order to remove him from the premises.  If I were you, I would request the children notify me in the event your sister tried to move him in illegally.", "NTA you are entitled to your house", "NTA.. A sentence I grew up with and use with my own kids. My house, my rules. Besides you doing it from love. The concern is love for her and her kids, Even if she doesn't see it", "NTA\n\nYou own the house and you let her and her kids live there, allow her to get her life back on track and be an actual mother to her children. This man can and will destroy all your efforts if you allow him in her life. \n\nYou did the right thing. She doesn't see it right now being in love, but allowing him to move in will be her downfall and destroy the children as well.", "NTA. If your younger sister feels so strongly about it tell her she can buy older sister a house and let her move her deadbeat boyfriend in", "NTA. OP and his brothers seem like the only ones willing to protect those children. Good on them. Even if it pisses their sister off.", "NTA, because the kids seem to feel unsafe around him and you believe (with logical reason) that it'd be bad to have him around them.  If this was all about protecting your sister, YWBTA.  But protecting her minor children is absolutely an acceptable reason to interfere in her life like this.\n\nNot allowing someone to move into your property without a background check of some sort would also be reasonable if kids weren't involved.  I have a hunch there is a reason his last place won't let him renew his lease.\n\nIf you don't already have a written lease with her, I'd go talk to a lawyer to make sure you've got your bases covered if she tries to sneak move him in.", "INFO: Why was the house never deeded to the sister? Who made the decision to keep it in your names? \n\nAt this point I'm operating on NTA because she's made bad decisions in the past with men, she does have children in the house, and she's only been dating him 10 months but you've known him much longer. But I'm also wondering why the house was not fully given to her?", "nta. She has 10 years sober. 10 years or 10 days. Anyone who's dealt with addiction knows that this is an extremely bad idea. Especially with kids involved. She's only been dating him 10 months & he is an addict himself. She should know better. There's so many red flags here. It won't end well.", "NTA, but don't say you bought her a house.  You bought a house you let her live in.  But if it was actually hers you wouldn't get a say.\n\nI think you're doing the right thing, but it would be less controlling if instead of saying you can't let him move in you said \"It's your choice.  I think it's a poor choice, and I don't think it's safe for your kids.  I will call CPS if he moves in because of the safety issue.\".

If the BF is actively using it's a different situation but then the police would be a better call to make than CPS as CPS doesn't investigate drug crimes and anything short of them seeing him tweaked out of his mind or seeing paraphernalia on a home visit would likely be overlooked.

Your sister is an adult who is entitled to make her own decisions, including bad ones. She, not you, is the parent to her children and can decide who gets to interact with her children. I can appreciate how difficult it is to watch a sibling make bad decisions, jeopardize sobriety and associated with perceived ill company (I lived through this with my own sister and it killed her).

But I also alway pay rent on time and usually leave the place looking nicer than when I moved in, especially because I love to garden.", "You\u2019re correct in AZ.", "I can tell that your special needs kid is not an adult. Mine is.  First of all , mine has had disability since the age of four. Did not kick in at 18-21 (and why such an oddball range).  And the representative payee is not the guardian, doesn't have to be, and you have to go to court to be named a guardian (I am my child's guardian).  And you can be denied if they are capable of making their own decisions.  Or you can be a guardian of the estate (that is who decides how the money is spent, not the payee), or a guardian of the person, or both.  And medicare caretaker? If this person has been special needs since childnood, it is medicaid, not medicare, and you dont get respite type caregivers once they turn 18.  They would have to find a self direct program in the state, and that is how you get a family member to be the paid caregiver of someone over the age of 18. Otherwise you wind up with an agency that handles those things (who cannot be the guardian but there are agencies that do nothing but guardianship.  I gave them guardianship of the estate because I hate all the paperwork, and we split guardianship of the person. This way when I die everything is set up.  But the point is, the agency then sets up the person with the housing, the caregivers, and so on.  They do the case management, basically.\n\nNot only do I do this for my kid, but I've been assisting other families with dealing with these systems. Usually for minor children but now more with adults.  Have been assisting and advocating and navigating for others since about 2010, informally, then started with an agency on an as needed basis.", "You mean the autistic brother that has the free caregiver?", "Not in every lease.", "I know people who have been sober for fifty years.", "I know addicts who own property who have been clean for decades. At some point you have to let go."]}
