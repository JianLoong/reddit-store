We have a similar expectation for our children - after high school, if they are living with us, they must be occupied full time either through work, school, or a combination.  Children need to leave the nest but my job as a parent doesn\u2019t stop at the 18th birthday.  If my child isn\u2019t ready then I will find ways to help them become ready.

He's also learned who will truly support him in a time of need.\n\nI am a parent of two sons. My youngest is about to graduate college. Oldest has been done with college for three years and is working full time. He's also living with us rent free. Our youngest will be afforded the same opportunity. While it does make their lives easier, why wouldn't I want to make their lives easier and give them the best possible start in life?\n\nI get why some parents want their kids to \"learn to be an adult\", but they should have been focusing on that far earlier than age 18. Before they finished high school, both of my son's knew how to clean any room in the house including bathrooms, mops floors, do laundry, cook meals, make grocery lists and go shopping, pay bills, manage a budget, manage their financial accounts, balance a checkbook, and nearly all of the other mundane things we adults need to handle on a daily or weekly basis. Paying rent? That's just another bill. Knowing how to take care of all of the other stuff is far, far more important to basic adulting.", "NTA.\n\n> demonizing her by saying she was too harsh\n\nIf the shoe fits - she was trying to charge her son, who was still a high school student, for rent! That's preposterous.", "NTA - where did she expect him to live? Someone's garden shed? An abandoned house?  Did she think he was going to get some part time entry level position and be able to put a roof over his head with his Dunkin Donuts shifts?\n\nI'd want to make sure John was progressing in his trades program as a condition of free room and board if he were under my roof, but you've given no indication that he's struggling there.", "NTA.

He chose to live with you as you offered. And I can't see that your sister has any valid point. You say that your nephew does chores, dog sits for you, and is becoming skilled in a trade. If you were truly enabling him to become a mooch he would just be laying around all day doing nothing. Since that isn't the case she doesn't have a leg to stand on and you are a great aunt.", "NTA\n\nI understand why some parents do the rent thing.  It good to have clear expectations & boundaries.  \\*after\\* high schoo, thoughl. HOWEVER, I do not understand why she is so mad at \\*you about her child choosing to not stay at home with those expectations.  It's the perfect setup! Doubly so, since it appears he was at risk of not being able to graduate high school.  If he didn't have your place to go to, it would have guaranteed him having to drop out of school altogether. \n\nI am biased, though! Our family kind of plays musical houses with adult kids.  When my baby cousin was 19-20, she lived with our family while she went to community college. Not that she couldn't stay at home, but it is good to have the separation from a parent while learning to adult bit by bit, instead of trial by fire.  My auntie even gave me some money every month to cover extra utilities (damn that girl loved long showers, lol) My oldest daughter (now 23) currently is with my sister (now I do pay my sister some money every month + my daughter does the lawn in the summer, shovels snow in the winter). My other kid at 20 lived with my parents for a few months to help out with their small biz. \n\nI would tell your sister to get over it & move on.", "Sally\u2019s embarrassment about her misjudgment is causing her to double down and lash out. She needs to move on.", "NTA\n\nI fundamentally can\u2019t get behind your sister\u2019s philosophies at all. In my mind, I firmly believe you do not ever take money from the next generation. It\u2019s our job as the parent to guide them to full independence. If they can\u2019t stand on their own two feet, it\u2019s due to our own parenting fails. Would she have charged her kid rent if he were severely special needs? NO-Parents need to own that children didn\u2019t choose to be born; we chose to have them. \n\nThat said, since you knew what your sister meant by her rule, I do think you\u2019re \u201cundermining\u201d your sister\u2019s \u201cphilosophy\u201d, but I\u2019m glad you are! I don\u2019t think this makes you an A H, because what she\u2019s doing is so WRONG! To not let you own kid finish HS before insisting on adulthood in the world is just horrific. You sister has failed him miserably. \n\nThere\u2019s one area that both of you need to work on though. John\u2019s sisters should not have been involved or gotten to voice their opinion. Forcing or even asking them to choose sides is wrong. Even if all that happened was a discussion, it shouldn\u2019t have happened in front of them. Together, you and your sister are potentially undermining their triple sibling relationship. There is also the potential that you are damaging your own relationship with the girls, so please be proactive about your support for them as well. \n\nEven my own (at 24, 23, and 20) are 100% independent (we don\u2019t have to cover cell bills, insurance or anything). But they know that our home is their home. While they might all be a flight away, we make sure we unconditionally support them. The reality is that even governments don\u2019t absolve all parents at 18. They still need our help-my middle one couldn\u2019t rent a car recently for a work trip bc she\u2019s not 25! We had to help her figure out what to do. \n\nDefinitely NTA, thank you for supporting all your nieces and nephews, but while you do, make sure you are solely aiming for their independence. Make sure you aren\u2019t confusing your own loss into the mix. I don\u2019t think you are, I just think it needs to be said. Everyone should have an auntie like you!", "NTA.\n\nThe thing is John isn\u2019t being lazy. He is training to be an electrician, he does chores in the house, and dogsits as payment. Sally is trying to teach him to not ask for help whenever he needs it. \n\nBesides, Sally wants to treat him like an adult, she has to accept his choices.\n\n>One of Sally's biggest parenting tenets was that at age 18, her kids needed to start paying rent or move out.\n\nJohn did exactly the latter, he moved out lmao. I honestly think Sally just wanted to get rent money out of John or find an excuse to kick him out. She is mad at you and your husband because you took that messed up opportunity away from her", "NTA\n You are not undermining parenting, you are helping another legal adult. Sally's time to parent has passed, now it's up to John to find his living accommodations, and he did.", "NTA.  Your nephew is progressing in life and functions well around the house.  What's the harm you are alleged to have done to him?\n\nSister might just be angry that she was wrong.", "She WAS too harsh.  Most state laws cite that you as a parent are responsible for the child until they graduate high school regardless of when they turn 18 in terms of being a parent. I don\u2019t know what country or state they were in but the fact that he was still in high school when she made these demands of him seems unreasonable. \n\nAdditionally as an adult I think you are teaching Sally that adults get to choose whatever they want to do and have the freedom to make decisions on their own. John and you have made decisions you were both OK with all of this and as long as you\u2019re OK with it and John is OK with it - what is the problem?  It sounds like John is actually thriving now. Sally\u2019s feelings are not your problem. Sally needs to go to therapy and work out her feelings. The fact that she claims you\u2019re playing mom to him just shows that she is feeling guilty and knows that she screwed up. She just doesn\u2019t want to admit it and this is on her not you\n\nNTA", "NTA.\n\nYou didn't undermine her parenting. She was going to throw him out. Not yiur fault you were there to pick him up, especially since she was going to put the pressure on him to work and pay rent in his last year of highschool.\n\nBesides, she gave him the choice to pay rent or move out. He moved out. It's not your fault he has a great, awesome aunt to have his back.", "NTA He was still in high school! And now he\u2019s able to continue school! Also, every kid is different and this kid had extra challenges. You can\u2019t treat all of your children the same, because they are not the same.", "NTA and I'm the harsh mom that charges children rent at 18. You can't charge them rent before they finish high school! My rule is college or rent. It never even occurred to me to try and charge my child rent before finishing high school. They can't work full time while in high school! \n\nYour sister was giving her a son a very bad start into adulthood. She was putting him in the position of either struggling with rent/back rent while trying to get his high school diploma or struggling with homelessness while trying to get his high school diploma. That's not teaching your child to be a responsible adult. That fucking them over while they're still in the starting gate.", "Nta yeah that's not parenting.  She said 'pay or move out' and is now all *shocked pikachu face* that he moved out!", "NTA. John is not mooching off you. He is taking advantage of your generous offer, as he should. Were it up to his \"loving mum\", he might be living under a bridge by now.", "NTA. Asking an 18 year old to pay rent who hasn\u2019t even finished high school is very harsh. It doesn\u2019t sound like you are enabling him to be lazy at all. He\u2019s finishing school, learning a trade, and helping out around the house. You\u2019re just helping him through a tough transitional period in his life. She wants him to act like an adult, so he made the adult decision to move out of her house and move somewhere else that he was invited to live. Sounds like a smart financial and emotional decision on his part.", "NTA. Just because he isn't paying you rent doesn't mean he isn't paying to live there. He's doing chores, he's dog/house sitting, etc. He is contributing to the household while going to school. It is literally the same thing her daughters are doing. They live in a dorm. They aren't technically paying monthly rent either but contribute as an adult would to the living space. Their tuition is likely paid by student loans, not \"traditional hardwork\". Where is the outrage there? \n\nI'd also love to know how a high school kid who is struggling in school is supposed to work enough to pay rent and still manage to keep his grades up to graduate.", "NTA. He is not a kid anymore. He is by definition an adult, and your sister's reign has ended. It doesn't matter what she thinks. She has no jurisdiction.", "NTA. \nYour sister was going to evict him, and once out of the house, she wouldn\u2019t get a say in his life at all. He is very lucky to have you. Well done.", "NTA and you\u2019re a very kind, generous person.", "John is 18, he's an adult. It's no longer possible to \"undermine\" your sister's parenting of him. But you did offer him a situation that allowed him to find success, and she's mad because it's working.\n\nAlso,\n\n>John accepted my offer eagerly and finished high school under my roof. \n\nShe seriously started charging him rent and threatening to evict him before he'd even finished high school? Gross.\n\nNTA.", "Sally: Once you turn 18, you\u2019re on your own! You have to figure things out for yourself!\n\nJohn: [figures things out for self]\n\nSally: No, not like THAT!\n\nFor someone who was so anxious to scoot John out the door and force him to be independent, Sally sure is being a helicopter mom. You\u2019re NTA here.", "NTA and sorry to your sister but the proof is in the pudding. He's not lazy, he finished school and he's working towards solid goals. Good on you.", "NTA. And funnily enough, forcing your kid to pay rent before they finished school is illegal in quite some countries too. (Nevermind evicting them)", "NTA\n\nAsking someone who is still in full time HS education to pay rent is a bit far.", "ESH.\n\nI mean I completley understand where Sally is coming from - John is *barley* an adult and she wants him to learn responsibility. Part of becoming an adult is paying board/rent, especially when you have a job. At the end of the day...Sally is his  mother and what she's saying - it isnt actually unreasonable nor is it an uncommon belief. \n\nOn the other hand it's your house and it's your choice whether you charge rent or not.\n\nI think you could very easily compromise with Sally on this..you could charge him a small amount. There's no harm in it OP. Lots of parents feel this way.", "NTA he's not lazy he's working on a trade and he is helping you out around the house and with the dog.\n\nI think the tough love approach works for a lot of kids, but it doesn't for all of them. John seems like it wouldn't be effective for him. College doesn't seem like the best path for him and there's nothing wrong with that we _need_ electricians! \n\nThanks for supporting this young man instead of throwing him out to the cold world. He will be better for it", "NTA - Sally said \"pay rent or move out\". So he moved out. THAT ended her 'parenting journey'. You ARE getting compensating from John in terms of chores and dogsitting that can cost hundreds of dollars. And he is pursuing a trade that can last him a lifetime. Seems to me that Sally is simply finally seeing that her 'tough love' was neither.", "NTA but definitely a tough situation. Obviously your treatment of John has not backfired in ANY way, and it's really sad she chooses to see her son as lazy or less-than, when he's had academic accomplishments, began pursuing a career, and developed great habits around household contributions. This really all began with Sally's overly tough treatment of her son, and failure to support his unique needs as a person with learning disabilities - she was going to put him in a position of not being able to even finish HS while under her roof, which is extreme and harmful. It's not about being equal, but equitable, and it seems he didn't have the skills to achieve what his siblings were able to. She's in the wrong here but I'm sure she'll never see that.\n\nUltimately it's clear you're a force for good in John's life. I encourage you to keep calm when talking to Sally, make it clear the intent has never been to UNDERMINE her but to help out John when you could see he needed it, and that you hope she'll see it's working out wonderfully for him, including that he's developing INTO the independent, hard-working, professionally qualified adult that she wants him to be.", "Except that he\u2019s not lazy. He\u2019s getting education and forming a base for his future career. Her point doesn\u2019t even make sense. A lot of parent have this rule for adult children that they can stay for free so long they\u2019re getting some education. I think it\u2019s very fair, as it gives the kid the opportunity to learn without distractions and additional stress of having to simultaneously take care of all bills, which at the beginning of most careers is difficult, since the pay is low. NTA", "NTA, this isn't undermining any parenting, it's helping an ADULT relative out of a shitty situation.\n\nYour sister sounds like a real peach. One that's been dropped from the tree and pawed over by squirrels till the ants found it.", "NTA. The kid is an adult working on a future. Mom needs to get over it. Has nothing to do with her. Your house your rules.", "Definitely NTA. It\u2019s very hard to undermine someone else\u2019s parenting when that parent stopped being a parent to their child as soon as the child turned 18. He\u2019s not mooching off your mindless like she thinks. You and your husband are more supportive of him moving at his own pace fathering than throwing him to the wolves of adulthood. Sally doesn\u2019t seem to take any consideration for his disabilities either. Is she in denial that it/they exists? Or does she just not care?", "NTA\r  \nYou reached out to a family member who was struggling. In return he learned kindness is not dead and he\u2019s not alone in the world.\r  \nWhat if you never reached out? Would he now be homeless, because his mother would say pay rent or move out? Would he become an asset to society? Would he live a life of crime?\r  \nEvery human being has different kind of needs. Some need more help than others. Just because your sister experienced certain things in life does not automatically mean that someone else should experience the same thing. \r  \nBesides he is 18 and of the life choices he made was taking up on your offer not knowing how it would turn out. Still darn brave to me by stepping in the unknown.", "\"by offering him a free place to stay we denied him the chance to learn how to survive on his own\"\n\nWe're Humna, we're community animals. It's almost impossible to succeed on your own. No man is an island.\n\nNTA.", "NTA  \n1. I can't agree with this parenting tactic of you get to 18 and you pay me rent. I'm sure some people think it's a great life lesson but I think your job as a parent is to set your kids up as much as possible for success and hamstringing them financially doesn't do that  \n2. He isn't lazy:  \n   i. He is training to be an electrician  \n  ii. He is doing chores around you house and being generally \n     helpful  \n3. I think you are teaching him to be independent as you are allowing him to grow up properly and to have a worthwhile career.  \n4. Good for you for being good people", "NTA.\n\nBeing a parent doesn't entitle you to ownership of the human being.  He is legally an adult.Parents can't have it both ways.  You can't say \"at 18 you're out\" or \"under my roof, my rules\" and then have your bluff called.\n\nIf your nephew was 25 years old and living on the couch, I would call you a co-dependent. enabler.  However, he's getting his education.\n\nAs long as an adult child is preparing for life, I'm willing to extend them grace.  Every situation is different.  Stop arguing with your sister about it.  Just tell her \"he's an adult\" and you don't want to discuss.", "NTA. It's one thing to ask for rent from an adult child who isn't in school. It's a good way to help them work toward independence. But they're not truly an adult until they're done with high school since their job prospects are very limited until then. Additionally, you can't undermine the parenting of someone who's DONE PARENTING. It would be a different story if he were still a minor and you were telling him his mother is wrong about certain methods. Definitely avoid ACTUALLY demonizing her, but letting him stay with you isn't that.\n\nAnd it's not like he's just sitting around playing video games and not looking/training for a job. Becoming an electrician is hard work, and it sounds like he's diligent about it. Plus he's going out of his way to help around the house without being asked! My family's rule (my maternal grandmother's AND my parents') was always if you're in school as an adult, you could live at home rent-free, but if you weren't in school or unpaid training, you had to get a job or pay rent. My parents both felt they put two very independent, hard-working adults out into the world (and at fairly young ages), and my grandmother felt the same with 3 out of her 4.\n\nTalk to him now about what you expect for when he gets a paid apprenticeship or other paid work. It would likely be good for both you and John if he started paying something at that point. You might want to spell all this out in a written agreement. (My parents did with my brother and me, and if handled respectfully, it demonstrates that you respect him as a fellow adult and are treating him as such.) It will help set him up for future success when he moves out. Since he has learning disabilities, you might want to work with him on budgeting and financial literacy, especially once he has paid work. (Honestly, I think all kids need more education on this, from both parents and their schools.)\n\nAs for Sally, you should ask her to sit down and have a civil discussion about it. Start by emphasizing how his diligence in his training program and his willingness to help out around the house UNASKED speaks so well to how she raised him. Tell her you're not attempting to demonize her, be clear that you never have and never will bad-mouth her to him, and explain the plans you and John agreed to once he's done with his electrician training. If no other accord can be reached, you at least need to all agree not to bring the issue up at family gatherings. This could end up in the \"agree to disagree\" category, but ultimately, John IS an adult, and he needs to do what's best for his education and future.

She abdicated her responsibilities so you stepped in, she\u2019s just mad bc you are doing it better . Too bad. Don\u2019t suck as a parent next time.  \nAlso, what she did was most likely illegal too as it is her responsibility to provide as long as the kid is still in school. \nI have a 17 yr old and I wouldn\u2019t kick her out the minute she turned 18, it\u2019s cruel. But, I\u2019ve  made it clear she has to go to school, get a job and or be helpful in some capacity. \nGood on you for being good people.", "NTA. But you could say to her that she did a great job raising him. He's finished and is going to school despite learning disabilities, volunteers for chores and is an absolute joy to be around. He's probably just a great guy, but she must have done something right too.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nHe's 18, and is old enough to choose where he wants to live. He choose you, as his landlord, rather than his mother.\n\nShe wants to continue controlling him, but chooses to ignore the fact that a free place to live was her only leverage. (Edit: So, you're not really interfering with anything)\n\nGood on you for supporting giving him a place to stay while he finishes his education!", "NTA.\n\nFirst, John is 18. Any actual parenting is long done. I understand that the work of a parent is never truly done, but at 18 (and realistically a couple years before that), the nature of that job changes dramatically.\n\nSecond, and imo more importantly\u2026 am I reading this right? Your sister wanted John to come up with six months back rent (presumably plus front rent) while he was still finishing high school? That\u2019s just ridiculous. Especially given his struggles with learning disabilities, the **LAST** thing he needed was to be worried about finances during the educational homestretch. Some people thrive under pressure, and it seems to have worked out well for both Mary and Jane. That said, it very clearly wasn\u2019t working for John. Meanwhile, the environment you provided was clearly much better for his productivity. He\u2019s finished school and is in training for a well-paid, in demand career with a strong union to represent his interests. He\u2019s already well on his way toward self-sufficiency, and I think it\u2019s likely your intervention in his life gave him the platform upon which to make that happen.\n\nI mean, let\u2019s run it back the other way. Let\u2019s say that at 18, John had to add rent to his juggling act. How does an 18yo high school student earn money? Probably with a fast food job or some other low paid, high stress job. Such a job is almost guaranteed to interfere with the school work of somebody who is already academically struggling. There is a very distinct possibility that had he stayed under Sally\u2019s roof, John wouldn\u2019t have finished high school, and would now be moving into adulthood with the equivalent of a McDonalds job and it\u2019s low pay ceiling. Instead, he\u2019s a high school graduate working on a promising future. The reality is you gave John the environment he needed to achieve that trajectory, and you should be proud of him and yourself.\n\nFurthermore, Sally is mischaracterizing her son\u2019s current reality. She seems to think he\u2019s lazily freeloading off your generosity. He\u2019s not. Not only is he preparing himself for financial independence, but since he arrived under your roof, he\u2019s taken it upon himself to contribute to the household by doing chores. This wasn\u2019t at your prompting, it was done at his own initiative. That\u2019s something *Sally* should be proud of. She may not have provided him with the best environment for his educational well-being, but she did instill in him enough of a work ethic that he came to you prepared to pull what share of the weight that he realistically could while focusing on scholastic success.\n\nYou\u2019re not the asshole, and while Sally isn\u2019t a bad person, she\u2019s letting her ego blind her to the fact that her son is thriving under a different approach. You\u2019re a blessing in his life, and I hope she is able to acknowledge that before she does irreparable harm to her relationships with both you and John. I wish all of you the best.", "So, he was still in high school and she wanted her son to pay rent? And her options were pay rent, or move out? \n\nWell, he took option two. So what exactly is she complaining about? He is an adult, and free to do what he wants. \n\nNTA", "NTA the mothers jealous he is doing a lot better since he moved out. and good on him with him having learning difficulties you would think his mother would have been more understanding and more helpful in trying to get him a career instead of telling him to pay rent while still in school", "Agreed. My son turned 18 in July *after* he graduated and my only stipulation was that he needed to either attend some kind of school (college, trade, certificate whatever to jumpstart his career) or work. He chose college and is living at home rent-free and works part-time for his own expenses and to save for his future. He saved to buy his car and I matched whatever he saved when he purchased it. I asked that he pay his cell phone bill and car insurance so that he understands the beginnings of having financial responsibility.  There is not only one way to parent and everyone does something different but the whole \"turn 18 and pay up regardless if you are still in school\" mentality is def not the way to go!", "Exactly! My son turned 18 last July and we said the same. He chose college and is working part-time. I want my son to succeed, not just stress him with rent just because he turned 18! We are still trying to navigate the best way to do things because I left home at 17 and had very little guidance from my family.  Trying to do something better for him and this just makes sense to me!", "The really messed up thing is the other kids were prepared for this.\n\nI'm guessing that means mama Sally expected them to plan ahead by working during the summer and saving that money to pay rent between their eighteenth birthdays and when they moved into the college dorms.", "I suspect Sally doesn't see on-the-job trades experience as \"school\" because it isn't in a classroom environment on a campus with dorms.", "Like here - I know you\u2019re struggling in school and having trouble with your academics but let me pile some more responsibility on you so that you can get even more overwhelmed. This is what I call love", "Honestly, I think Sally just wanted to either get rent out of John (since the other kids are in dorms) or she wanted an excuse to kick John out", "Right?  If he\u2019s an adult that needs to move out and make independent decisions, she doesn\u2019t get to bitch about his decisions and who he chooses to live with.\n\nShe\u2019s just angry he didn\u2019t fail and come back to mummy so she could tell him how right she was about him being lazy and a failure", "That is was bothered me. John is still in high school. That\u2019s going to make it harder for him to work a job to pay rent. It sounds like he has some disabilities that would have made it harder for him to become independent at 18.", "Why should she compromise?\n\nSally told John to start paying rent or get out. He got out. Where he landed is no concern of hers. What if he had a friend who let him move in for free? Would that give Sally the right to complain to them about it?", "It seems to me Sally is overdoing it. She charges them starting on their 18th birthday, and not the more reasonable time of graduating high school. So this poor kid would have to be struggling to graduate high school as well as finding work. I\u2019m pretty sure in my country at least you\u2019re obligated to provide for your children until they have graduated high school, not the 18th at cut off.", "This. Mama wanted him to learn to survive on his own. Auntie taught him how to thrive in community with others.", "Yeah. It sounds like the other two kids had to save up to pay the rent between the months they turned 18 and when they went to college. I'm pretty sure Mary's position is going to change when her student loans start coming due around the time John starts earning Journeyman Electrician money.", "He didn't even graduate high school before his mom started to charge him rent and he had to move out.", "Exactly!", "Yeah, this is basically Sally saying \"How dare you not let me bully my son with the threat of homelessness!\"", "Yup thats reeeeeally going to teach him responsibility and independence (sarcasm)", "I don't think she has a right to complain. \n\nMy point is, is that it's not unreasonable or uncommon to charge an 18 year old rent/board. Whatever happened in the past, doesn't really change that fact. \n\nI also said it's OPs house and she can do what she likes. \n\nI think there is room for compromise because sallys belief isn't unreasonable.  OP doesn't have to do anything though - it's up to OP.  That's why I said ESH. I don't think anybody is right or wrong. \n\nMost ppl seem to be judging this post on what happened between Sally and John in the past . I ignored that when I made my judgement.\n\nI'm not trying to offend anyone.\n\nEdit - if I was judging solely on what happened prior to John moving in with OP I would have said NTA too. But I felt that either way sallys *belief* was indeed fair - as was how OP felt.", "All I'm saying is that it's not uncommon or unreasonable, however everyone's circumstances are different. It doesn't mean I would charge the kid btw \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\nI'm not taking sides, because the bottom line is that neither of them are wrong or right in what they believe.\nAnd they are sisters yeah?", "Totally! He'll have plenty of time to be homeless when he gets a little older.", "No, there's no room for compromise because Sally isn't involved in the situation any more. She gave up her right to have any say in the matter the minute she demanded rent under the threat of evicting John.\n\nAnd why would you comment on what Sally thinks now while ignoring what Sally did to John? That makes no sense whatsoever.", "Your explanation for your judgment seems more like N A H than E S H.", "Because i felt like there was more than one thing going on in OPs post.  \nYour acting like I judged OP the AH. I didnt.\n\nBottom line is this - Whether or not OP charges the kid rent..really has nothing to do with sallys past behaviour. \n\nIs OP an asshole for not charging the kid rent? No. Is Sally an asshole for believing the kid should pay rent and telling OP this? No because lots of ppl think this way. \n\nNobody is wrong. But..\n\nIs Sally an asshole for saying pay or leave? Yes.", ">Is Sally an asshole for believing the kid should pay rent. No. Is Sally an asshole for saying pay or leave? Yes.\n\nYou do realize these two issues are directly related, right? She didn't just \"believe\" the kid should pay rent. She expected him to start paying rent the day he turned eighteen, and have a plan to have her paid in full by six months after his birthday or be evicted.\n\nYou can't separate the two issues here.", "But after the 'pay or leave' thing- she approached OP - saying that she thinks John should pay rent to OP to learn responsibility ect \n\nThat's how I separated the two. OP doesn't have to agree. It doesn't make sally wrong though.\n\nI felt like OP thought Sally was wrong in saying this..and that she was right in not charging him.  Does that make sense?", "No, it doesn't. Sally's terms were not just pay rent. It was pay rent immediately, regardless of still going to school at the time, regardless of how it might interfere with something like, I dunno, attending trade school, and that's unreasonable.\n\nThe kid is clearly alright and going places. Sally is just mad it's not on her terms."]}
