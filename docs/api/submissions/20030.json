Pregnancy doesn\u2019t count despite what some might think.", "Nta. You are absolutely correct that the past didn't magically go away because someone is about to become a parent. If Ashley wishes to consider this a clean slate she is free to do so - but you are under no obligation to do the same. The odds are it took your sister years to destroy your trust in her and it will take years to rebuild it - not just the failure to use a condom.", "NTA for not wanting to be MOH.  She hasn\u2019t earned the privilege of a second chance and if you don\u2019t want to do it then you don\u2019t have to, don\u2019t do it out of pressure.  Not being the MOH , or repairing the relationship if that\u2019s even possible, will not stop you from being a good aunt.", "NTA, stand your ground. If she really values you, she can slowly work on rebuilding that trust but pressuring you into being the MOH certainly won't do the trick", "NTA did Elizabeth at least apologise for her previous actions and behavior? She doesn\u2019t just get to wipe the slate clean just because she\u2019s having a baby.", "NTA\n I bet that Ashley said that to you because she's afraid that if you rejected being the Moh, Elisabeth will ask her next", "NTA. You set healthy boundaries and did what is best for your well-being.", "NTA\n\nAsk BOTH of your sisters...did Elizabeth ever give you a real apology? One that actually addressed what she did wrong? (Not a \"I'm sorry for whatever I did\" type non-apology)\n\nBecause if she never sincerely apologized, then there is precisely zero expectation that she has changed in any way. No apology means she doesn't think she did anything worth apologizing for - which means she'll see no problem doing it again.", "NTA. You have been burned too many times to just say Sure, I'll forgive you all of your sins. It's sad that Elizabeth doesn't understand the damage she has done. Because if she did, she wouldn't be getting huffy when you tell her no & show her the receipts. Respect has to be earned. And in Elizabeth's case, so does forgiveness.", "NTA. \n\nYou are supposed to give her another chance because she...showed up and started giving orders?\n\nForgive her, be a MOH, let her get angry at you, give in to her demand to go back to how things were. Oh, and make sure your wedding gift is small unmarked bills.\n\nIf she wants to rush to get married, they can have a small, simple wedding with a couple witnesses. \"What's best for the baby\" would probably be to save money for the baby, not spend it on a wedding. \n\nTrust might come after a change in behavior.

What has she done to make your relationship better? How has she shown you that she regrets her past actions? She didn\u2019t. She just picked you because she burned her friends and thinks that since you are family then you will feel obligated to do the work for her wedding. \n\nShe is literally using you again.

Elizabeth didn't do anything to gain back that trust. There was no apology, no remorse, no real intentions of wanting a relationship with her family.
