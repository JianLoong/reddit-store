Aka if you don\u2019t watch nibiling right now, I won\u2019t let you see them ever again etc.", "Ashley can do what she wants. NTA.", "NTA, Ashley is wrong.  People often do change (opinions, priorities, patience) somewhat after becoming a mother, but they don\u2019t have a whole personality transplant.  You are completely in the right here - if you give E an inch she will take the mile.  Don\u2019t do it.", "The special day is only \"special\" to the princess.  People who have abused you create barriers .  \"Please let me abuse you again.  That is all in the past.  You should be the \"bigger person and forgive.\"  Abusers don't change when they become pregnant.  They become more selfish.", "Sorry she sounds very manipulative. Maybe keep your boundaries  but be aware of the needs of the new baby. A difficult tightrope to walk. But would suggest the best for everyone is do mot play along. Its not going to help either the new baby or the mother's behaviour.  Give in now and you are just enabling and making bad worse. Good for you to understand this and wanting the best. Good luck and hugs.", "NTA. Elizabeth has shown her true colors with you more than once. You now believe her. Tell  Ashley that since she feels so strongly about this then she should take up the role of maid of honor. Let Elizabeth know that you will attend her wedding if invited and you will most likely buy her a gift but at best that is all you can offer. You don\u2019t need to put yourself in harm\u2019s way. You are using your common sense!", "nta you decide who you want a relationship with", "NTA you weren't cold and hostile, you put a firm boundary and explanation in place.", "What kind of BS is this? Most people DON\u2019T change because they got pregnant. If she was a shitty person before- she still is.. your Not The Ass and I don\u2019t blame you for not wanting to be the MoH.. you would be blamed for absolutely everything that may happen. NTA", ">Ashley says we should give Elizabeth a chance because most people really change after becoming moms. \n\nHuh? Ashley, name some people you know who changed. I don't know any.", "This", "It\u2019s Sad that it\u2019s a game to Elizabeth, in that- she\u2019s not looking out for ANYONE but herself.", ">did Elizabeth ever give you a real apology? One that actually addressed what she did wrong? (Not a \"I'm sorry for whatever I did\" type non-apology)\n\nNope. Not even an insincere \"sorry or whatever\" apology. The only thing Elizabeth has talked about is that we all need to \"think of what's best for the baby\" and \"leave the past in the past.\"", "100% agree with what you\u2019ve said.", "I'm not sure if Elizabeth's mother-in-law will be like that. Christopher's parents come from old money. So in his family's mind, people knowing that Elizabeth was pregnant before she and Christopher's marriage would be \"scandalous.\" Since Elizabeth and Christopher are going to be married before the baby starts showing, I doubt Christopher's parents are really going to be that overly-involved in what they do.\n\nThere's no indication that Elizabeth and Christopher have a bad relationship, at least from what Elizabeth and Ashley have told me. For them, getting married already just felt really soon. They may feel like they were tied down too early and possibly become resentful in the future, but we'll just have to wait and see how everything plays out.", "Oops 4got n t h", ">People like that see a chess piece, not a tiny human.\n\nThis is exactly what I fear and expect. I felt someone needed to make it clear to her now that my niece or nephew isn't an undo button for her bad choices.", "She's taken a hostage. Maybe some birthday greeting cards would be reasonable later, but sending thousands of dollars' worth of support should not be something you\u2019re considering.", "I\u2019ve seen this too and it\u2019s a sad situation.", "Nta if Ashley wants to give Elizabeth a chance that's on her. If she wants to give her child a positive role model again that's on her. Just because you become a mom doesn't mean you stop being toxic. Sometimes people do change but they are the ones that have to put in the work to show everyone they hurt that they change and it's up to those people if they want to have them back in their lives. Ashley has no right to demand you be Elizabeth's M.O.H. she can step up if she wants and be M.O.H.", "NTA. But Ashley is free to do whatever she wants.", "She just wants y\u2019all for free babysitting lol. Don\u2019t give in.", "Definitely not.   Big NTA.\n\nYou should give Elizabeth a chance to prove herself, but that doesn't mean putting yourself into situations that require a lot from you and you have no escape, such as being her MOH.   \n\nAnd you weren't wrong for what you said to Elizabeth.  Even if she does prove that she's changed, that doesn't mean you'll ever let your guard down around her again.   But there might be a middle ground -  a way you can have some relationship with her and her child, without opening yourself up to far.", "NTA. Your sister has made her bed (multiple times it seems like), now she has to lie in it. As for Ashley, sounds like she either needs to keep her opinions to herself or put her money where her mouth is. If I were you, I'd have a real hard time not saying \"I told you so\" to Ashley when Elizabeth treats her like she has everyone else.", "\"hey, can I be an asshole to you our entire lives then file for social bankruptcy and everything goes on as if I want an asshole all that time? No? Why not?\"\nNTA.", "NTA and Elizabeth sounds so entitled! Demanding people trust her again rather than actually being remorseful, seeking forgiveness and showing that she is not a greedy, self-serving person. Next thing you know but will be her preaching \u201cit takes a village\u201d and dumping her kind of everyone because FaMiLY! Did she even apologize?", "NTA  and maybe I am really jaded but her asking you to be moh is just another way for her to use you. You put time and energy into her wedding. She gets what she wants.\n\nHaving the baby is just another way she can use people and get her way. Your other sister is proof that it works. Now when the other sister doesn\u2019t do what Elizabeth wants she dangles the baby.\n\nI would not trust her. Trust and forgiveness is earned. Not given because your pregnant", "Your sister is a narcissist. Not even saying that as an insult, but forming relationships with people only because of how you can use that relationship is pretty basic NPD shit and Ashley is falling for your sister's manipulation hook line and sinker. Don't do the same. NTA", "NTA. Ashley can be MOH. She don't get a do over just because she  pregnant. If she wants trust, she can earn it.", "\"You're right Ashley, and how amazing of you to set the example for me by volunteering to be Elizabeth's MOH and take on all of those duties\". Then sit back and laugh while Elizabeth continues to be herself and Ashley gets a dose of her own medicine. NTA", ">INFO- can you give examples of how she used people? It\u2019s kinda hard to gage w/o some specifics\n\nHere are some fairly recent examples:\n\nWhile in her university, Elizabeth lived at home and commuted to campus. Me and Elizabeth had a mutual friend Kathy whose work commute happened to pass by Elizabeth's university. Elizabeth would regularly get rides from Kathy and was all friendly to Kathy. After Kathy reached out to Elizabeth to hang out after Elizabeth had gotten her own car, Elizabeth responded back with \"I don't need a ride anymore, why are you still texting me?\" Halfway through the year, Elizabeth ended up totaling her car and her insurance refused to help pay, so she once again needed a ride. Guess who was suddenly all friendly to Kathy again?\n\nElizabeth consistently got spending money from my cousin by lying about why she actually \"needed\" it. Three years ago, my cousin's husband had a stroke and passed away. My cousin essentially became a single parent overnight and it was an awful time for her. My cousin told Elizabeth that she just wouldn't be able to give her money anymore, and Elizabeth ghosted her. Not one call or text until my cousin was in a stable financial situation and \"useful\" to Elizabeth again.\n\nMy grandmother lives with my parents. She is a bit forgetful, as most are at her age, but is still perfectly independent and capable of looking after herself. Elizabeth tried petitioning to have my grandmother into a conservatorship. She lied to social services that my grandmother was mentally incompetent, our parents were intentionally neglecting her, and that Elizabeth should be in charge of making my grandmother's decisions (namely her financial decisions) for her. Obviously, it didn't work. This is when my parents really pulled away from Elizabeth.", "Wow ok- definitely NTA. She made her bed and she needs to live w the consequences. Becoming pregnant doesn\u2019t automatically erase all the hurt she\u2019s caused"]}
