It was contingent on her staying until the end.", "NTA, she didn\u2019t meet the condition that you had set which was clearly laid out to help create a smooth transition for you and your children, not because that time was going to be proportionately more taxing or she was doing anything extra during that time. \n\nYou set a condition for making extra money and she didn\u2019t meet it, costing you in the process by inconveniencing you when you\u2019d been pretty generous. It\u2019s really cheeky to ask for the extra in my opinion!", "NTA.  She bailed on you guys so she deserves nothing extra.", "NTA. The fact that the person said they weren't going to ask says a lot. Do you/they have a contract? Are you going to be putting them out onto the street? If not, then I'm pretty sure a simple: \"Sorry, that wasn't the deal we had.\" will probably get the point across.", "NTA assuming the agreement was for her to stay the whole time to get the additional compensation. \n\nSounds like she screwed you over and is coming back to ask for more.

You offered to pay her a bonus for a specific service which she did not provide, knowing it was going to cause you a great deal of difficulty.  I find it hard to believe her new employer couldn\u2019t be accommodating for one week - in such an intimate sort of working relationship, why would she want to go to work for a family whose first act is to demand that she break a commitment?  And why didn\u2019t she want every minute she could get with your children before never seeing them again?  \n\nShe could just be a very self-centered person with terrible judgment - or there could be factors you\u2019re leaving out.

The whole entire point of offering a month of extra wages to stay til the end is to avoid the chaotic bullshit you had to deal with.
