We had to lie and say one of us was getting married to even order it (they asked us for a set wedding date, which we also lied about). It wasn't a lot of cake for how much it cost, but I understand why it costs as much as it does. It wasn't exactly bank breaking, but still. It was our special treat. It is obvious what it is just by looking at it, because it says exactly what it is right there on the box.\n\nThe day between our birthdays we sat down at lunch with an espresso and tasted and rated each flavor. This was almost 10 years ago and I can't even remember which flavor I liked the most. It was special to us even if it wasn't for a wedding. We just wanted to taste all the cakes for fun.

Occasionally a decent amount of jurisdictions have some exceptions for things like companies or pieces of property only under one person's name that were established before the marriage, but that's pretty rare.\n\nFor example if I was married, my boxers are not even my own boxers as everything that me and my spouse own are both of ours together so we don't have \"our own\" anything, as everything we have is shared with at least one other human being.\n\nIt was a dumb joke that was probably barely worth a chuckle, and I've probably made it less funny by explaining it at the level of detail I just did haha", "I'll add a third probably likes showing off too, the cake she probably used to show off to her friends that she's not doing bad and could've easily posted her expensive drink too.
