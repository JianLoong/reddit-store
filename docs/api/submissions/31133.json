LOOOL, make sure to tell them they cant kick her out in her time of need just cause she drank some expensive whiskey.", "NTA - Maya sounds like a leech. Is it any wonder why this selfish entitled witch is having problems at home? Your FMIL doesn't want her either. She has a lot of nerve calling you. They should send her home.", "Is maya 16 or 32? Good lord no wonder her marriage is in the shitter.", "lmao imagine fucking up that bad at your brother's place only to do the same thing again at your mother's.", "NTA. I wonder why she\u2019s having relationship issues.", "I wonder what the nature of the \"marital struggles\" might be? /s\n\nNTA.", "NTA. I wouldn't have given her the gas money", "NTA \n\nNow your FMIL can deal with her theft.", "I think this is so funny, actually. Some of you really value things more than people. Yeah, it sucks that she ate the stupid cake samples, it also sucks that our society makes us believe weddings are worth spending thousands on, and that the wedding business is so unbelievably wealthy and that people take all this so seriously. And also that\u2019s it\u2019s ok to kick someone out for eating an expensive freakin\u2019 cake sample that probably cost 3 dollars to make (a friend of mine is a baker and she makes incredible cakes that are worth their high price, while wedding cakes are very rarely worth even a fourth of their price). It\u2019s all stupid and insane.", "Maya is a thief. NTA", "Stealing was the correct wording. She stole the cake, knowing it was wedding cake samples. She stole the expensive whiskey knowing she wasn\u2019t supposed to drink it. Taking what isn\u2019t yours is stealing. OP is NTA, FSIL and FMIL are.", "Just a thought, but perhaps that sense of entitlement and disregard for others might be playing a role in Maya\u2019s marital issues.", "Wonder why she\u2019s having relationship issues\u2026", "Nonsense, they fucked up by handing her gas money as well. Why on earth would you do that? Also, keep her stuff, sell it and use the money for more cake samples.", "You mean 'sampling' ;)", "Yep, the Fiance ROCKS.", "Maya is a thief, plain and simple. Not her cake, not her booze, and she has no intent of making the owners good again.", "Yeah... Wonder what relationship issues she has lol", "I positively love that the second thing FSIL was got drunk on the expensive whiskey \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\n\n\u201cI deserve it!! I need a pick me up \u2014 hiccup! \u2018Sides which, it tastes kind of shitty!\u201d", "Come on, he knew.  Why do you think he was so pissed off about getting her back?  Probably was all kinds of relieved to get that out of his house when she married, and was just fine \u201csupporting\u201d her from afar.  Now that his son and FDIL have washed their hands of her, it\u2019s his turn again. #karma #reapwhatyousow", "Tell her she had hers back at the house. Don't you remember? I don't actually practice petty, but I sure think of a lot of stuff, lol.", "GTFO of my house money.", "Exactly this! She's upset her marriage is in trouble, so taking it out on the happy bride.  It's childish, and I would have asked her to leave also. NTA.", "Exactly this! She's upset her marriage is in trouble, so taking it out on the happy bride.  It's childish, and I would have asked her to leave also. NTA.", "Lol.", "Future", "Completly agree this is so true you are my lord ^(BRUH)`BRUH`", "Woosh.", "Be careful in this thread today.\n\nFSIL may come for your cake day next!", "Happy cake day. Hopefully Maya doesn't eat yours too!", "Well timed happy cake day to you!", "Bwahahaha \ud83e\udd23 rightfully so", "Happy cake day! This is what I\u2019m thinking too.", "I agree. Let her parents deal with their consequences. Happy Cake Day!", "Most definitely lol.  It's a sign of a narcissist (I know that goddamn word gets thrown around and over-used like 'gaslighting' does a lot here but a spade is a spade sometimes lol).", "I had the same thought. Happy cake day!", "This is the winning comment  right here.  \ud83d\udcaf", "Happy Cake Day!", "Yeah, it's a mystery this one. /s\n\nNTA.", "She can't say that she doesn't have money to get to where she's going. And fmil can't yell at them for kicking her out with nothing.", "Exactly. Why did they give her more money? NTA", "I can't imagine! She sounds like a treat. Not only does she apparently have no way of supporting herself, but she can't even be respectful of those housing her... Who WOULDN'T want that?", "*She* knew & future *M*other in law can reap what *she* had sown. Who are you hashtagging at, this isn't tumblr", "What do you think FMIL stands for", "Ahh, thank you!  I hadn\u2019t noticed!", "sometimes you have to spend a little bit of money to get rid of a problem.", "Calm down.  You\u2019re going to be okay.", "\"You don't even like him. There's your answer right there. Look at it this way: It costs you 20 dollars to get rid of him... He's out of your life for 20 dollars.\"", "Nobody is going to be ok on this planet.", "Wow, I seemed to have really stepped in it.  Please forgive me for misreading FFIL for FMIL in the two posts leading up to my own post.  My brain failed me, I read it as the FFIL was mad about his whiskey and fighting with enabling FMIL.  \n\nAnd I had no idea that an occasional hashtag was a capital offense on Reddit, my deepest apologies to all who were impacted, please excuse my ignorance, it will never happen again."]}
