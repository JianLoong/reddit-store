Nor will it encourage strong self esteem in your son as he grows older.\n\nWhen obsessive worry strikes, tell your husband. \"I am feeling that obsessive need to check on the baby again. Can you help me to calm down with some reassurance?\" If he cares about you as a partner, he will remind you that all is well.
