And it\u2019s possible he deserved more\u2026 but you\u2019re NOT an AH for being concerned about your infant.", "NTA. have you considered talking to your doctor about postpartum anxiety??", "YTA for being obsessive. Your husband deserves some of your time and attention. Don\u2019t forget that you\u2019re both a partner and a mother", "ESH. You're calling excessively but your husband made you go on a trip you didn't want to go on when you were 8 months postpartum which is also a pretty dick move frankly.", "YTA! This is not healthy behavior.", "Gentle YTA. You need to seek some help in regards to anxiety. This isnt normal, and will start affecting your health and marriage, if it hasnt already. Chances are your husband noticed some things and urged the trip to get you some breathing room.", "YTA. If you cant bear to do something, do *not* agree, even under presure, to do it. Multiple times in one dinner is an unreasonable amount to call to check in. Get a backbone, youre allowed to stand by a \"no\".", "NTA\nOne time I left our firstborn with my husband, his father, who was a very capable and involved parent. I wrote our detailed instruction. While reviewing them with me, he said he felt like I didn't trust him. I said I do, but I needed to go over all the details in order to relax! Leaving a baby is hard, being nervous is normal. Many people would NOT leave a baby for a multi-day trip. Make sure your in-laws know you trust them but still have a need to check-in. Twice during dinner is a little excessive. \nBut not talking to your wife, or listening to her point of view is also excessive.", "YTA", "NTA. Your husband pushed you to go on this trip knowing that you weren't ready, and you're clearly having anxiety. I think you need to sit down with your husband and tell him how you're feeling.", "I don\u2019t care how many down votes I get, NTA!  You obviously either weren\u2019t ready to leave your child or weren\u2019t comfortable with whom you left them.  As a mother I don\u2019t care about anyone\u2019s feelings, if I\u2019m worried about my child I\u2019m checking on them.  I can understand your husband\u2019s frustration, but then he shouldn\u2019t have pushed you to leave your child when you weren\u2019t ready/comfortable!", "YTA.\n\nGood luck being a single mother because you are destroying your marriage because you can\u2019t control yourself.", "ESH, you absolutely shouldn't have gone if you were going to spend the entire trip blowing up the phone.", "YTA and a big one.  You are overly obsessed in fact.  Your son was fine and you did ruin the trip. You called once and he was crying?  Seriously?  He has never cried in your presence?  You need to get a grip on yourself before you ruin your relationship with your Inlaws and the one with your husband.", "YTA for insulting your in-laws.  I hope they never babysit for you again", "OP getting checked for postpartum anxiety would probably be a good idea. A family friend got diagnosed and treatment helped her a ton!", "Oh man, ladies. I have to disagree on this one\u2026 I mean to say, you\u2019re totally right that OP needs to be her own person, needs to maintain a relationship with husband apart from baby, etc; I get all of that\u2026 but when it\u2019s an infant, it makes sense to me. My kiddo is now 10 and I maybe text my mother in law once to check in. As an infant, and esp if it\u2019s the first baby\u2026 I think that sort of anxiety is pretty normal. Maybe it\u2019s not ideal, but she\u2019s not being an AH, she\u2019s just worried.", "Calling 6 times per day is probably excessive. Either the baby is super-easy and everything is fine so nothing to worry about\u2026 or else baby isn\u2019t easy, grandma has her hands full, and doesn\u2019t have the time/energy to talk to mom every other hour.\n\nSeriously, though, won\u2019t grandma call/text if something is really wrong?", "Thank you - finally someone with common sense.  It sounds like hubby pressured OP to leave the baby.  I\u2019m a mother of four and grandmother of 6 and neither my daughters or I left a baby overnight at that age.  The first time I left my kids and my daughters left theirs, it was a night away locally and we all checked in frequently.  Heck even when my grandkids were older I\u2019d get one word texts that just said \u201cpictures\u201d.  To suggest OP has marital problems or PPA because she didn\u2019t want to be that far away for that long are ridiculous.  It\u2019s normal to not want to be separated from your baby by that much distance for that long.  Hubby is the one that\u2019s an AH.  It doesn\u2019t even sound like MIL has a problem with the calls based on OP\u2019s post.  Assuming MIL is not one of those MIL\u2019s I\u2019m sure she understands.", "If she's so worried that she needs to call back a second time during dinner because the baby was crying (something they do all the time for completely benign reasons), she needs therapy. This is not normal worry.", "I disagree.", "Well put. This is bizarre behavior that will drive her support system away when she needs them most.", "tbh it just sounds like she is coming up with any excuse to call again. babies cry, go figure", "NTA. This sounds like insensitivity on other people's parts. I think they could have had more understanding about how difficult this would have been for you, especially if you already said you had a hard time before even going into something. The fact that you mentioned that he had dinner with an Associate made me think that this was a business trip. I think a caring and empathetic husbands and father would have understood that you are simply concerned about the child you gave birth to. The fact that he was angry rather than wanting to understand where you were coming from, means he is prioritizing his feelings over that of a child. He's the one who has more emotional maturity and control, he should maybe extend some empathy to the baby.", "NTA!!!!! Your kid, your life, your feelings. \nIt seems to me that the phone calls are for you to feel better/comfortable, not because you don't trust your inlaws - they should know better and should support you and not take it personally. \nMy mom will text me to check in if she calls and baby/toddler is crying so I have to hang up. It's not controlling or lack of trust, it just feels good to know for sure that someone you love is okay and is feeling better (not crying).\n\nAlso 3 days away from 8 mo is alot; personally I wouldn't have gone or I would have brought baby (but everyone is different). \nAlso, you are a good mom!!! Just gonna assume the internet is being mean and you might need that reminder.", "YTA. \n\nYou realize your mother in law has raised a child before maybe even more than one. Babies cry all the time, it's the only way they have to communicate. It's rude to not trust your mother in law and it's rude to spend your whole trip calling to check on the baby. You can't soothe them over the phone so stop.", "Helicopter mom alert....\n\nYTA", "NTA and I can\u2019t believe that people are saying you are. If I had rung and my baby had been crying I would have rung back to see if they had settled. If I was looking after a baby I would send a message letting the parents know he had settled.", "YTA for excessively calling. A few times a day (once in the AM, before bed) wouldn\u2019t be so bad but that amount is a lot. I think you should speak to your dr at your next visit. If you are extremely worried, it might be something deeper.", "NTA\n\nI\u2019ve said it before and I\u2019ll say it again: Reddit aita is not the place to ask questions about parenting, especially babies. So many people on this sub have no experience being parents, and those that do often don\u2019t have experience being empathetic and attached parents. 8 months is far too young to be away from your baby for three days. The fact that your husband insisted on this when you clearly told him you were not comfortable makes him the AH. If he wants to be a big baby and give you the silent treatment because you were appropriately anxious then go ahead and enjoy the silence.", "YTA - I get that you're nervous is a new mom, but you need to trust the person you left your child with. Your husband same to turn out okay so you need to let loose a little.", "NTA. I wouldn\u2019t have gone on the trip at all when my son was the age. I give you kudos for even trying. But maybe next time trying compromising a date or something that you can do or enjoy at ease and you can concentrate on your husband.", "If you have had ongoing challenges with anxiety, no, NTA.\n\nHowever, as a mother myself, I have to say you might need to learn to relax a bit. My kids are older now but my son is autistic and mentally a toddler, even though he is physically a teen. I struggled with learning to trust him with others until he was 6. I gave up & began to send him to school only when I had a breakdown from the sheer exhaustion of caring for him 24/7. Even parents who have perfectly developing kids go through a lot of stress parenting and it gets really stressful when they become teenagers! \n\nYou're lucky that you have an extended family to help you with him. It helps a lot... so learn to trust people with your son. It makes a huge difference. Think of it like this -- if your MIL did a great job with your husband why would she screw up with her grandson? That makes no sense! So relax. It'll be fine. \n\nGood luck & happy parenting! \n\nHang in there.", "NTA - for those saying otherwise, shame on you! \n\nShe is a mother of an 8 month old baby. It's perfectly normal to feel this way, particularly if a) you're not ready to leave them yet and b) it's your first time spending time away! \n\nGood for you mama. Don't feel bad for calling to check up on your child. Your husband sounds like he needs a clip around the ear.", "Your baby is 8 months old, not a newborn. Your MIL has raised children before. You had a chance for a quick getaway with your husband, and you blew it because you had to obsessively bug your MIL during a working dinner with your husband's associate. YTA", "I'm going with NTA only because it sounds like you have post partum anxiety and I know how it feels to have that uncontrollable sense of impending doom for the people you love the most. You WBTA if you don't talk to your doctor about it. You can even start with your OB if you feel more comfortable with them and they can get you set up with a short term medication and likely refer you to a family medicine doctor or psychiatrist for further medication management. \n\nSometimes your brain chemistry and hormones betray you and that's okay...just don't be afraid to ask for help. Wishing you the best, OP.", "Your husband is TA for pushing you to leave the baby before you are ready.  You\u2019re a soft AH for calling too much, and for allowing him to pressure you. I can\u2019t imagine leaving a baby that young for more than an evening out. (And I was not a helicopter parent by any means and have a very independent and successful young adult child.)", "NAH. Check in with your doctor this sounds dangerously like peripartum OCD. Intense fear related to the baby (obsession), followed by a soothing action that doesn't truly alleviate the fear (compulsion). This is dangerous to yourself, your baby, and your relationship. It's time to seek help.", "A mild YTA (answer to your question) \n\nIt\u2019s hard to be away from your LO, and it\u2019s okay to want to check in but calling twice during dinner makes you the mild asshole. Your MIL would have alerted you immediately if there was a problem, and it sounds like it was an important business dinner for your husband. \n\nClearly you weren\u2019t ready to leave baby in that capacity. You probably should have started smaller (an overnight staycation for example) I doubt your MIL was annoyed by it though so don\u2019t stress about that. You need to apologise to your husband about leaving the dinner but don\u2019t apologise about your anxiety. Maybe he also misses spending time with you as a wife, maybe you can organise a staycation over New Years so you can build up to leaving your bubbah for longer periods.\n\nGood luck.", "NTA. What in the world are all these YTAs about? It\u2019s an alarming snapshot into how hard we are on mamas. OF COURSE you wanted to call back and check on your baby since he was crying during the first call - your nervous system was probably so so jangled from hearing your baby cry and not being able to comfort him! Fighting our primal urge to be connected to our children in order to please a husband (or a society) is not such a straightforward process, it can literally be physically painful. If you\u2019re not ready to be away from your baby, you\u2019re not ready, and so your actions reflected that reality perfectly. Your baby is lucky to have such a connected mom and I\u2019m sorry your husband sees that as an impediment, rather than perfectly natural.", "YTA, but I think you are having some major anxieties regarding your child that I think you should consider reaching out and asking for help about. Consider a therapist, or even just talking to your obstetrician or any doctor about your anxieties and fears and see if they can offer you any support or skills to healthy cope.", "It seems your husband missed his wife and wanted to spend time with her and reconnect.\n\nThis was your response to him : \n\n>I only came on the trip because it was what he wanted\n\nYou tell me , ayta ? :/\n\nI understand you being worried, i REALLY do, but i dont think this was the way to go about it or that you should have said that. Please apologize. :/", "I did this with my own parents when I was a new mum, I had seperation anxiety and mum guilt so bad.. I still flick a text and he's almost 6. \n\nHis dad made me go out to \"reconnect in our relationship\" at 17 days old and I cried and cried, my boobies exploded and I went home and I spoke to someone and that was, what caused my intense anxiety. \n\nI know I'll be more chill with number 2 (she's born in 9 days!!) Because I know what I won't be doing and what I'm comfortable with now.\n\nI don't think you are an asshole.

I agreed to a trip with my husband when my baby was about that age and my MiL also watched my daughter. I called as often as I wanted and my husband and my in-laws had ZERO problems with it. My husband called frequently too or asked me to call.   \nmy daughter wasn\u2019t smothered  at all.

Communication is at zero and OP is now a \"mumma\" and not a wife or even her own self anymore.", "Husband is not gonna be around at this rate. I love all the N T A answers in here, theyre coming from teenagers and people whos whole identity is \"im a mumma\" crowd.", "For goodness sake. This is ridiculous.", "Are you advocating for domestic violence? Bro grow up", "Agreed", "What gets me though is why wouldn\u2019t you call before the dinner? And then maybe need to call during.
