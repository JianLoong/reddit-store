How is it sustainable/desirable that a parent stays almost 24/7 with a kid for almost 30 months??", "I never stated a child should be with their primary caregiver 24/7 for 2.5yrs I said extended time away from caregivers such as overnights is discouraged from occuring regularly. There are times that may be needed or desired - my 18 month old has had an overnight once. And there is a big difference between extended periods of time like multiple days, and together 24/7. \n\nThe important thing is genuine and authentic interaction with your child when you are home, regardless of how long that is. Personally, I would say my son is securely attached to both me and his father - while I am his primary attachment being the sahp, his attachment to his father is very secure despite him working full time. \n\nThe 30-month figure is usually used in cases referring to custody arrangements, as a guideline for how to build custody overtime, with overnights with the non primary carer being recommended from 30 months, in most situations (there is debate on the actual number of months, and of course this us dependant family to family based on the attachment of child woth each individual parent, some children are ready much earlier I'd securely attached to both parents). \n\nFrom my research, ideally, birth parents should be supported to remain home for the first 26w to maximise opportunities to develop secure attachment and support exclusively breastfeeding as per health recs. Birth parents being able to access 26w of mat leave is associated with better health outcomes for both the parent and child in this dyad in the long term (and it actually costs the government less money to fund this, when the associated health costs are considered for countries with good public health care systems). \n\nWhen a parent is not able to access that leave, ensuring responsive care to your child when you are able to be present. Responding to your child's needs builds attachment.

As other people pointed out, it could be post-partum anxiety.", "Pretty sure she said that she didn\u2019t want to and also I bet she didn\u2019t realise how hard it would be.", "This is the only right answer. \n\nESH.", "My kid's just about the same age as in the post. If my wife couldn't go out to dinner with me without having to obsessively check on the baby, I'd be pretty annoyed. Just because you also did a behavior doesn't make that behavior normal or healthy.", "I only agreed to let my daughter sleepover my in-laws for ONE night at 8 months because we had moved across the road from them. Before that? No way. \n\nAnd now at 2 years old, the max she can sleepover is two or three nights. Even then, she comes back home in the day to be with me. My in-laws fetch her in the evening. \n\nTo be somewhere that's a plane ride away? A hard & definite no, even at 2 years old. \n\nNTA, at all!", "I was thinking along the same lines, the calls sound like they\u2019re bordering on obsessive which is a little beyond run of the mill mum away from child anxiety", "How so?", "So she shouldn\u2019t prioritize herself over her husband wtf", "Just for the record, I never stated that I engaged in that behavior; nor do I believe that \u201cjust because I do it, it\u2019s healthy.\u201d I said that her anxiety and worry makes sense.", "Wait for baby number two, OP. You\u2019ll barely turn your head when he falls off the bed.", "[deleted]", "Babies cry for any reason and no reason. I was giving my daughter a bath last night, took her diaper off, started bawling. But then she got in the bath, she started splashing and was happy as could be. But then it was time to get out of the bath, and once again, she lost it. \n\nYou know the problem? She was tired. It was time to go to bed. Babies cry, and that's just a fact you have to live with as a parent.", "Are you a mother?", "What is being a 100% parent mean can you explain?", "[deleted]", "It was in response to the sentence that follows below that a fellow Redditor said.  \u201cOP, you are still a person with an identity that is not wholly described by \"mother.\"- And my responses are based on this if that helps explain it better.", "It's really cute when childless people have strong options about this stuff. Please never put a child and partner through the firemage007 parenting experience, you sound like a nightmare.", "INFO: was there any trauma during pregnancy and birth, or any serious illness prior to this trip? What's the anxiety stemming from?", "Esh except inlaws, OP I'd really reccomend looking into getting help for your anxiety, I've never had children so I cannot understand your experience but I do have a severe anxiety disorder and you seem to be really anxious and it is affecting your life and your husband is a bit insensitive but he seems to be wanting time with you just not being understanding necessarily. Anxiety can be helped, I wish you luck and wonderful times with your kiddo and family <3", "Yta. Your baby wasn\u2019t alone. And the fact that you left a dinner twice to call- what is wrong with you?", "NTA\n\nDo not listen to anyone who makes you feel bad for missing and wanting to connect with your baby. They are wrong! You are just being a good mama.", "YTA\u2014your calling was obsessive and ruined the trip for your husband. Your MIL presumably raised at least one child and is capable of taking care of your son. It\u2019s fine to check in but you went way overboard, especially during dinner.", "Yes YTA for agreeing to a trip you weren\u2019t comfortable with and then calling your in laws nonstop. It\u2019s good to take time away. We did for the first time around 8/9 months but would\u2019ve done so much sooner if not for covid concerns. Everyone is different, but you need to take some time for yourself and your marriage too.", "ESH - your husband shouldn't have forced the issue. There's no way I'd be comfortable leaving an 8 month old with someone else for three days. However, did he force this because he wants your attention? Calling multiple times during a single dinner is over the top so you probably need to address your anxiety in that regard. If you had been in the same city and just gone out for a couple hours would you have called as much?\n\nThere are some larger issues here, but honestly I'm baffled at the idea of leaving a kid who is under a year old with someone else for multiple days.", "YTA. That\u2019s obsessive behaviour. I\u2019m embarrassed for you. Will you be attending school with him everyday also? On dates? When he loses his virginity? My mistake. You won\u2019t let him go on dates. \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "ESH \n\nOP, you should\u2019ve stood your ground and not have taken the trip. Your anxiety is understandable, but your behavior was excessive.\n\nYour husband should\u2019ve understood that you did not want to leave your eight month old baby.", "NTA. You are allowed to feel anxious about leaving your infant alone, you call 500 times if you want to. Everyone saying that you overreacted is underreacting.", "I\u2019m going against the grain but NTA.  \nI get where everyone is coming from with the excess of the calls but from experience it\u2019s sounds like PPA and that is no joke. Definitely see someone about it and try to get on some medication it helped me so much.  Again though I don\u2019t think you are the A H I just think you need help.", "NAH. This was me, especially with my first. I then got treated for post partum anxiety and it made a huge difference. My husband couldn\u2019t understand what I was going through until I could understand it and with the help of a therapist I was able to work with him through it. He just saw a fixation on the baby. The second time around I knew to just get treated.", "I don\u2019t think your an AH. A few years ago we left our 3 yr old son with my parents for 5 days and went on vaca. We called once a day and it was obv my mom was a little irritated we didn\u2019t trust her. It was a fun vaca, but a little awkward for everyone so we haven\u2019t done that again.", "NTA - I would not have been able to resist calling either at that point PP but I\u2019m also quite sure I was suffering from PPA. Probably worth calling your OB for some guidance, they can certainly help!", "YTA\n\nSeriously you are allowed to be away from your child for a couple of nights. This anxiety is not healthy, your adult relationship with your husband is really important, every couple should have adult time together without your children even if they are still a baby.\n\nTo be a great parent and partner you have to care for yourself and your relationships. This also sometimes means adult alone time. You have to trust those around you to be capable adults who know how to look after a child, after all your MiL did it OK the first time around.", "I' going to go against the grain here, and say NTA. You are a first-time mother. I was too, once, and leaving the baby was something that was very very hard for me. Oh sure, I could do it for a few hours, but for a few days? No way. She was my baby! She grew inside my body! To be away from her was like being away from a part of myself. Unlike most Redditors here, I understand where you are coming from. Take a deep breath, though, it's going to be okay. You two are tight. And welcome to motherhood. It's a wild ride.", "NTA it was clearly too soon for you, your husband should be understanding of that.", "NTA, that's 8mo baby. I'd be more concerned if you weren't fretting about him.", "NAH. Please talk to your doctor or a therapist. It sounds like you\u2019re struggling and you deserve support. You deserve to be able to enjoy your time away from your child.", "YTA. And a ridiculous helicopter mother.", "ESH. Husband has a right to want to spend time with his spouse. She has a right not to be ready. You both suck because you both, from this story, are not communicating with each other. \n\nExplain to him the anxiety you are feeling. A lot of people in the sub are basing it off their own experience or even their lack of. Your hormones are all over the place, post partum isn't just one flavor. You have to become used to the possibility of being away from your son a little bit. Obviously this cold turkey method isn't for you. Take it step by step but communicate to your husband. 5 hours to 3 days is a scary jump.  I get it. You both had this baby, as a unit (maybe?), start slipping back into communicating again as a unit.\n\nEdit: Spelling", "People calling you TA have no idea what it\u2019s like to have extreme separation anxiety from your baby. It gets easier as they get older but 8 months is still so early. I wouldn\u2019t have been able to go and think I would be in the same boat.", "NAH\n\nYou aren't ready and need to figure out why you are SO anxious about leaving your son with supposedly trustworthy people. \n\nYour husband is probably starved for attention and wanted a few days COMPLETELY away from your kid so you would be more likely to actually interact with him. \n\nAre you and him doing anything, just the two of you, when you're at home? Where you aren't calling the babysitter, or talking about your child the whole time you are supposed to be spending time with him?", "I mean it really depends on the mother in law and your relationship with her. This is a specific situation type thing.", "YTA wtf you left a professional dinner twice because \\*checks notes\\* a baby was crying? Babies cry. That's literally all you do. Are you gonna do this when he goes to school? your mil clearly knows how to take care of children, and 1. you're telling her that you don't trust her and she's never gonna wanna watch him for you again, but you're also telling your husband that you don't respect him, his coworkers, or his special time with you.", "YTA. I also want to point out the OP never replied when she was asked if she told her husband that she didn't want to travel and explained that she was anxious. \n\nIt sounds like she kept her anxiety to herself, went on the trip to please him and then threw that in his face and was extremely clingy and controlling to the in-laws. \n\nNext time stay at home OP, no one can force you to travel and leave your baby against your will. It's best to stay at home than to behave like this.", "Her husband is an adult. The baby is a baby. Gimme a break.", "Where does is say she was forced?\n\nShe is an adult; she can say no.", "The difference is the obsessive calling. Of course it\u2019s normal to call and check on your child! Like she\u2019s a first time mom, of course she\u2019s going to worry. But calling so much she walked away from dinner twice!? What does that mean for the rest of the trip when she wasn\u2019t even distracted being out with other people!? She must\u2019ve called way too much.", "Don\u2019t forget to take time for yourself, mom! I have a 9 month old and only recently starting detaching from my little one more and more. We got a babysitter just so I can have a few hours of time to poop, shower, grocery shop, etc. without having to worry about baby. You wouldn\u2019t believe how much better it can make you feel mentally to have a small break. Baby loves spending time with the babysitter and then we both get super happy when we see each other again. It\u2019s almost like we have a nice little break that makes us appreciate the time we spend together more.", "Not only that, but calling so much is actively hindering MIL from tending to the crying baby!", "OP needs to learn to self soothe and not give in to the anxiety and worry. Notice that OP said they left their baby alone. That's anxiety talking.", "I was hoping someone would write that so I don't have to be the only weirdo that would never leave such small baby for so long, except for an emergency.\nNTA, the husband is TA for forcing OP into this and not being understanding for her feelings, that are completely normal for a young mother.", "Came here to say this! He shouldn't have made her go on a multi-day trip that required flying before she was ready. While I agree, the amount of times she called is excessive, the desire to check in that often is sooo strong! The first weekend I spent away from my baby was for my friend's Bachelorette trip. While everyone else took a 30 minute ferry to the destination, I drove 2 hours in my car to make sure I could leave at a moments notice. Knowing that I had a way back on a time table that I could control, helped me relax and enjoy myself with friends.", "Not only overnight but a PLANE TRIP away from them. If there's an emergency it would take hours to get back to them. I don't blame her a bit for being anxious. NTA", "I thought that too. It\u2019s obsessive unless you have PPA then it\u2019s pathological and needs assistance", "This is not PPA, but natural motherly instinct. The child is to young to be left without parents for so long.", "You don't value husbands that much, now do you? The husband was worried about their relationship, and yes, even mothers should take that into account. She needs therapy.", "I didn't manage to leave for 3 days until my babies were almost 3. I nursed them until they were 2 1/2 and they were garbage sleepers. I didn't want anyone else to have to deal with that.", "I have two teens. I didn't leave them overnight except when the youngest was born until they were 7 or 8. My husband and I have been together 22 years so it obviously didn't affect us.", "No one you know has *ever* traveled without their kid before 8 months of age? You don't know any moms who work corporate jobs? I would have considered traveling without my kid if it hadn't been COVID. Would have been nice to get a full night of sleep, honestly.", "I know lots of people who have gone away for a couple of nights when there babies were younger than 8 months.", "8 months old is plenty old enough to stay with relatives for a day or two while mom and dad do something else. \n\nI see a mom who is developing an unhealthy, obsessive attachment to her child.", "Because her worry is preventing her from being able to function in a healthy manner. The family friend I mentioned was diagnosed because she was constantly hovering over her baby afraid they were going to die if she wasn't watching them 24/7 (she was a medical examiner and had seen several dead babies / children). Seeking treatment lowered her stress levels and allowed her to enjoy motherhood more.", "This was a mom pushed to do something she didn't want. However, she should be checked for post partum. From my experience, I had the same obsessive pattern with my son. It took me getting on medication to lower the obsession I had. I mean if I was away for 2-3 hours I'd call his father to check on him or stop by the daycare. Loving your child is fine. Obsessing over them to the point I was is not.", "I agree! I am child free and sympathize with OP. Her husband sounds like kind of a jerk!", "You were around your daughter, so that was different. You saw that she was crying for no reason. This lady was a plane ride away, hearing her 8-month-old baby cry through a phone. Have some sympathy. It's insane to go from a one-night stay to a three-day stay.", "This is one instance. Her first time being away from her child and she was away for 3 days. Having anxiety about being away from your child for the first time is normal. Active mothers don\u2019t take 3 days away from their baby as a first time away. This isn\u2019t a constant thing, this isn\u2019t like she\u2019s taking drugs. She wouldn\u2019t have known it would affect her the way it did if she\u2019s never been away from her child."]}
