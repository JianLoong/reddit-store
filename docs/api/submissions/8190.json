On the occasion I see her I am polite but remain a respectful distance. She's no one I would willingly spend time with outside of being the sister of my husband. Anyway, she recently called my husband and asked him if she could borrow $2,000 because her daughter (23F) wants to move out of the apartment she shares with her boyfriend because they aren't getting along and she doesn't want to be there anymore. He told her he doesn't have the money as we're using it for our Disney trip. She told him her daughter' should be more important and, as the godfather and uncle of her only daughter, he should be willing to sacrifice for her. He told her he'd discuss it with me and call her back. When he asked me, I told him absolutely not and told him he was a simp for even considering sacrificing our vacation for his niece.  We've been planning this trip for two years, our twins are looking forward to it and quite frankly, his sister did a poor job raising her daughter so I wasn't willing to sacrifice for her.  His sister called me trying to plead her case and I told her I wasn't concerned nor interested but I would send her a lovely postcard from Disney.

You should have been more kind to your husband when he was worried about his niece (women who call their own husbands simps sometime find their simp with another woman) and what's with your SIL?   You all suck, at every turn someone's behaving badly.   Send a post card from Disney?  Your poor children.", "YTA for the postcard comment. That was completely unnecessary. \n\nNTA for the rest of it. Regardless of how you feel toward your SIL, helping out your niece *if you are able* would be a nice gesture toward her (the niece).

Why isn't she taking her daughter in herself?", "I would have said not the ah until you took the the low road. Calling your husband a simp because he came to you to discuss the issue, as he absolutelyshould have done. And second for the I'm not concerned or interested but I will send you a post card remark.

This is not the magic of Disney!", "There has to be plenty of conversations about this that we do not know- the niece can move back in with SIL and save money to move back out, it\u2019s ludicrous to think that SIL could just guilt people into loaning $2,000 knowing they have such an expensive trip planned for their own kids (SIL niece/nephew.)", "Husband was just being a weak ass, putting the OP on the spot, so his side of the family can blame OP.

Like OP is supposed to bail out an adult who's in a boo hoo fight with her BF. Umm.... nope.", "And did you notice that SIL is only 38?  No mention of this being a stepdaughter, so mom had her when she herself was 15. Too young to learn parenting skills, apparently.", "Honestly I\u2019d argue that\u2019s even worse. Having kids at that age is not an easy thing to do, they both (SIL and niece) probably struggled to some extent while the niece grew up. I mean idk specifically how SILs parenting was but it sounds like she genuinely does care for her daughter and wants what\u2019s best for her. Reading it again it\u2019s almost like OP is proud to say she shut SIL down in a mean and cruel way.", "What does any of that have to do what she said to her partner.  \n\nIf you asked your partner to see if you two could help your family and their first response is to insult you and call you names.

Would thay be ok because she  would have been acting like a \"weak ass\"", "NTA tell everyone in the family that your sil and niece will be so excited they are contributing to her move out fund.
