It's less than 1m sq so only safe for one kid at a time. I do encourage my kids to play fair and will prompt them if I think they are monopoliesing a piece of play equipment to let others use it. Yesterday was teacher strike in my are so many schools were closed meaning more kids in the playground. \n\nMy son saw the trampoline was free and went to play. He had been on all of 20seconds when another kid wanted to play. She yelled at him to get off but he said he had only just got here.  The other kids parent came over and said he had to get off because it was someone else's turn. I stepped in and said he hadn't been using it long and he could continue to play. \n\nThe parent called me out for not making my kid share and I'm making him entitled. I stupidly said he's been on for 30seconds so are they going to make their kid got off after such a short play. They said their kid would get off once another kid came to play. I told them that was stupid as that could be in another 10 seconds and it would be best to wait until the kid tires of playing (which never takes long) or to prompt them if there were other kids waiting and they had been on for a few minutes instead of seconds so they could have a proper play. \n\nThe parent was having none of it and my lil dude doesn't do well with confrontation so I asked him if he would like to go play somewhere else, freeing up the trampoline and getting us both away from the situation. The parent proceed to have their kid follow my son onto every bit of play equipment he went on so. I heard her say stuff like \"would you like to play on the rocker\" another single use toy my son was now on. We went on the climbing frame so she ushered her kid that way. Not to play side by side but to what felt like intimidated my kid while the parent glared none stop at me. I gave up, pulled out his bubble wand and told him to go play. \n\nThe other kid tried to get that too but I put a firm stop to that and said they should have brought their own with them if they wanted to play with bubbles. \n\nI dont fancy another playground trip for a while. \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1683097130, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/136d14i/aita_for_not_making_my_kid_share/", "score": 303, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I think you\u2019re selling yourself short by describing this as \u201cnot making your kid share\u201d. This isn\u2019t about sharing imo. This is about other parents being entitled and not making their kids wait their turn.", "NTA, she is teaching her kid to be entitled and a bully. When they came over, saying something like \"one more minute and then we can play on something else so this kid can play\" is more than reasonable", "NTA It would be one thing if your kid was using one piece of equipment for a long time, but 20 seconds is not a long time, and you were fair in explaining that your son had not been on it for long. The other mum's behaviour of then following you around is psychotic and definitely makes her TA.", "Nta, wth this mom sounds like a lunatic.\n\nIt's one thing getting upset about your kid not being able to play, but to follow around one kid  and try to take over what they're playing on is just weird and just...a waste of time. Pettiness at its worst.", "That person sounds insufferable. \n\nINFO: I haven\u2019t even seen a child up close in like 20 years. Aren\u2019t there some unspoken time limit rules like on the cardio equipment at the gym?", "NTA. The other parent is teaching their kid how to be an asshole.", "NTA,  but you do realize you allowed this woman and her son to bully you and your son.", "NTA\n\nI think, from what you've described, the other parent was being completely unreasonable. Following you and your child around the playground was next level imo.\n\nI'm so sorry you and your little one had to go through this.", "NTA.  The other mom is like the crazy person who road rages at you because you didn't let them cut into your lane at the last minute and spends the next 10 miles following you and trying to brake check you.", "NTA.  Everyone else covered the entitlement of the other parent, I\u2019ll just talk hard numbers.  On a thing like what you described, I\u2019d expect a kid to get off and give another kid a try after about 2 minutes or so- maybe 90 seconds .  MAYBE 1 minute at the absolute least.", "It's quite rich for her to say that you are the one raising an entitled child, wtf, that's literally what she's doing with her kid. NTA,you were the reasonable one here.", "NTA and this is how entitled kid are grown. If it was upto me, I would have stopped looked at the kid and asked the kid 'Are you proud of being pushed around by your parent?' Some people are not meant to be parents and the kids they raise usually leads to tax payers money being wasted as they grow up.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You should have confronted the woman the instant she began making her child follow your son.", "Absolutely NTA. Ironically, the other parent is the one making THEIR child entitled by not waiting their turn. We have those little trampoline sin parks near me and I can definitely confirm they're a health hazard for more than 1 child at once. Don't be afraid to take your child to the playground if he wants to go, but stand your ground with the other parent if they return/if the issue persists. Your child has every right to play and shouldn't be kicked off after 30 seconds.", "NTA. You\u2019re right, kids only have to share when it\u2019s a shareable item. Sharing doesn\u2019t mean taking something from someone if they\u2019re already using it. \n\nIf your kid had been on the trampoline for a long time, then yeah. He needs to share. But he JUST got on it. I guess you could set a timer or something. But the other mom was way too pushy.", "Thank you. I struggle in some social situations and wasn't sure if I was just doing what's nicest for my son but not what's fair for others.", "It was her behaviour after the fact that made e think maybe I had don't the wrong thing. The playground isn't usually that busy so I thought maybe I'd handled it wrong", "I've always played by the unspoken rule of if no one is about you get free use for as long as you like but if the area is busy a few minutes each. I look at it a bit like fairgrounds rides except without the charge.", "2 minutes is what i was thinking. Its hard for me to continue to pretend him jumping in the same spot is amazing for more than this length of time anyway.", "\u201cWasn\u2019t sure if I was just doing what\u2019s nicest for my son but not what\u2019s fair for others\u201d\n\nNope, that would be precisely what the other parent was doing!", "You handled it correctly. Teaching kids to share means teaching them that when it comes to single-person things, it involves using it for a fair amount of time. \"Let others have a go\" is important, but so is \"Wait your turn.\"", "Yeah. I would just be like \u201cmy kid\u2019s got 3 minutes left. Check your manual, bye\u201d.", "So, in other words, this post belongs in r/entitledparents?", "Gonna try this next time \ud83d\ude02", "Really have to say it with conviction. Like god it\u2019s so obvious.", "I would have told the mom to tell her child to wait his turn & find something else to play on for a few minutes or simply wait it out. Kids get bored easily & after a few minutes, your child would have been ready to move onto something else and no need for much parental involvement, certainly not the confrontation she brought.", "Dude ure title makes it sound like youve got a spoiled kid and tht ure entitled nd hate sharing so u might wanna reconsider the title. As for the post itself NTA u were letting ure son share FAIRLY the other parent just wanted her son to have it now regardeless of sharing and turn taking so why would u be TA if shes the one being entitled???", "NTA That other mother is blatantly training her kid to be a bully. Also, using her kid as a tool for revenge against a random stranger is very f--ked up.", "NTA she was bullying you and teaching her child how to bully a kid.", "NTA.\n\nI would have been ultra mean, give my kiddo (not like I have any) a little drink timeout, wait for her kid to start playing and politely ask her to get her kid to give way to mine since that\u2019s the standard she had set.", "NTA.", "This is also about a parent coaching and encouraging their child to be a bully. If I were OP I'd be pissed", "So much projection and lack of self-awareness. I hope that lady steps barefoot on so many Lego.", "No you were fine; she was trying to punish your child or spoiling for a fight.\n\nNTA. And please do go back, your good memories will absolutely overtop this bad experience.", "I don\u2019t think the other parent was doing something nice for her son, she was been cruel and vindictive towards OP for not bowing to her demands", "NTA, but please teach yourself and your son healthy tactics for conflict handling. You tried to avoid and the other parent and kid followed you around?! That's agression and really unacceptable! \n\nMy man you don't fancy a trip to the playground anymore?! You should go every day this week, it's not your son avoiding confrontation, it's you! Go get yourself some conflict and defend your kid's right to play. \n\nTell your kid what's fair, he has every right to go on the trampoline and have fun as long as he takes turns with other kids. \n\nTeach him how to navigate this stuff. Tell him it can be hard. Ask him how he feels about it. He'll learn to trust his instinct, negotiate his place in the world and build resilience. That's really valuable stuff to be learned at the playground. Even for you ;)", "NTA.  This wasn't \"sharing\" - this was another parent teaching her child how to be a bully.", "NTA.\n\nThis isn't about \"sharing.\" This is about an entitled parent weaponizing the concept of sharing to bully others.", "NTA. I'm currently on the fence about having kids and it's stuff like this that puts me firmly in the hell no camp. Not necessarily the kids, but the other entitled jerk parents who are way too immature themselves to effectively raise other humans.", "Stand up for your kid and yourself and tell the parent to screw", "NTA the other woman sounds like she shouldn't be raising a child.", "NTA, and that other parent is the one who's going to raise an entitled monster, just like herself.", "This turned from entitled parent (not you) to stalking everywhere you went. I think you handled it very well, and it was a shame that the other child is going to grow up in that overly entitled environment. \n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nThe mother was following around a little boy she doesn't know to repeatedly harass him. That's bullying behavior that I would have called out as predatory, if for no other reason than to draw attention and embarass the other mom into leaving.\n\nSo you were significantly calmer than I would have been, OP.", "Right. Op is NTA. That woman was totally unhinged and op handled it very well. Honestly while reading how she kept following op\u2019s kid around with hers trying to consistently bully him off the things he was playing on made my blood boil. I dunno if I would\u2019ve handled as well personally.", "That parent sounds unhinged. Someone is teaching their kid entitlement and it's not you."]}
