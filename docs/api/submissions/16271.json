It's less than 1m sq so only safe for one kid at a time. I do encourage my kids to play fair and will prompt them if I think they are monopoliesing a piece of play equipment to let others use it. Yesterday was teacher strike in my are so many schools were closed meaning more kids in the playground. \n\nMy son saw the trampoline was free and went to play. He had been on all of 20seconds when another kid wanted to play. She yelled at him to get off but he said he had only just got here.  The other kids parent came over and said he had to get off because it was someone else's turn. I stepped in and said he hadn't been using it long and he could continue to play. \n\nThe parent called me out for not making my kid share and I'm making him entitled. I stupidly said he's been on for 30seconds so are they going to make their kid got off after such a short play. They said their kid would get off once another kid came to play. I told them that was stupid as that could be in another 10 seconds and it would be best to wait until the kid tires of playing (which never takes long) or to prompt them if there were other kids waiting and they had been on for a few minutes instead of seconds so they could have a proper play. \n\nThe parent was having none of it and my lil dude doesn't do well with confrontation so I asked him if he would like to go play somewhere else, freeing up the trampoline and getting us both away from the situation. The parent proceed to have their kid follow my son onto every bit of play equipment he went on so. I heard her say stuff like \"would you like to play on the rocker\" another single use toy my son was now on. We went on the climbing frame so she ushered her kid that way. Not to play side by side but to what felt like intimidated my kid while the parent glared none stop at me. I gave up, pulled out his bubble wand and told him to go play. \n\nThe other kid tried to get that too but I put a firm stop to that and said they should have brought their own with them if they wanted to play with bubbles. \n\nI dont fancy another playground trip for a while. \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1683097130, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/136d14i/aita_for_not_making_my_kid_share/", "score": 66, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I think you\u2019re selling yourself short by describing this as \u201cnot making your kid share\u201d. This isn\u2019t about sharing imo. This is about other parents being entitled and not making their kids wait their turn.", "NTA, she is teaching her kid to be entitled and a bully. When they came over, saying something like \"one more minute and then we can play on something else so this kid can play\" is more than reasonable", "NTA It would be one thing if your kid was using one piece of equipment for a long time, but 20 seconds is not a long time, and you were fair in explaining that your son had not been on it for long. The other mum's behaviour of then following you around is psychotic and definitely makes her TA.", "Nta, wth this mom sounds like a lunatic.\n\nIt's one thing getting upset about your kid not being able to play, but to follow around one kid  and try to take over what they're playing on is just weird and just...a waste of time. Pettiness at its worst.", "That person sounds insufferable. \n\nINFO: I haven\u2019t even seen a child up close in like 20 years. Aren\u2019t there some unspoken time limit rules like on the cardio equipment at the gym?", "NTA. The other parent is teaching their kid how to be an asshole.", "NTA,  but you do realize you allowed this woman and her son to bully you and your son.", "NTA\n\nI think, from what you've described, the other parent was being completely unreasonable. Following you and your child around the playground was next level imo.\n\nI'm so sorry you and your little one had to go through this.", "NTA.  The other mom is like the crazy person who road rages at you because you didn't let them cut into your lane at the last minute and spends the next 10 miles following you and trying to brake check you.", "NTA.  Everyone else covered the entitlement of the other parent, I\u2019ll just talk hard numbers.  On a thing like what you described, I\u2019d expect a kid to get off and give another kid a try after about 2 minutes or so- maybe 90 seconds .  MAYBE 1 minute at the absolute least.", "It's quite rich for her to say that you are the one raising an entitled child, wtf, that's literally what she's doing with her kid. NTA,you were the reasonable one here.", "NTA and this is how entitled kid are grown. If it was upto me, I would have stopped looked at the kid and asked the kid 'Are you proud of being pushed around by your parent?' Some people are not meant to be parents and the kids they raise usually leads to tax payers money being wasted as they grow up.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You should have confronted the woman the instant she began making her child follow your son.", "Absolutely NTA. Ironically, the other parent is the one making THEIR child entitled by not waiting their turn. We have those little trampoline sin parks near me and I can definitely confirm they're a health hazard for more than 1 child at once. Don't be afraid to take your child to the playground if he wants to go, but stand your ground with the other parent if they return/if the issue persists. Your child has every right to play and shouldn't be kicked off after 30 seconds.", "NTA. You\u2019re right, kids only have to share when it\u2019s a shareable item. Sharing doesn\u2019t mean taking something from someone if they\u2019re already using it. \n\nIf your kid had been on the trampoline for a long time, then yeah. He needs to share. But he JUST got on it. I guess you could set a timer or something. But the other mom was way too pushy.", "Thank you. I struggle in some social situations and wasn't sure if I was just doing what's nicest for my son but not what's fair for others.", "It was her behaviour after the fact that made e think maybe I had don't the wrong thing. The playground isn't usually that busy so I thought maybe I'd handled it wrong", "I've always played by the unspoken rule of if no one is about you get free use for as long as you like but if the area is busy a few minutes each. I look at it a bit like fairgrounds rides except without the charge.", "2 minutes is what i was thinking. Its hard for me to continue to pretend him jumping in the same spot is amazing for more than this length of time anyway.", "\u201cWasn\u2019t sure if I was just doing what\u2019s nicest for my son but not what\u2019s fair for others\u201d\n\nNope, that would be precisely what the other parent was doing!", "You handled it correctly. Teaching kids to share means teaching them that when it comes to single-person things, it involves using it for a fair amount of time. \"Let others have a go\" is important, but so is \"Wait your turn.\"", "Yeah. I would just be like \u201cmy kid\u2019s got 3 minutes left.
