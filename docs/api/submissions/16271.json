You should have confronted the woman the instant she began making her child follow your son.", "Absolutely NTA. Ironically, the other parent is the one making THEIR child entitled by not waiting their turn. We have those little trampoline sin parks near me and I can definitely confirm they're a health hazard for more than 1 child at once. Don't be afraid to take your child to the playground if he wants to go, but stand your ground with the other parent if they return/if the issue persists. Your child has every right to play and shouldn't be kicked off after 30 seconds.", "NTA. You\u2019re right, kids only have to share when it\u2019s a shareable item. Sharing doesn\u2019t mean taking something from someone if they\u2019re already using it. \n\nIf your kid had been on the trampoline for a long time, then yeah. He needs to share. But he JUST got on it. I guess you could set a timer or something. But the other mom was way too pushy.", "Thank you.

You should go every day this week, it's not your son avoiding confrontation, it's you! Go get yourself some conflict and defend your kid's right to play. \n\nTell your kid what's fair, he has every right to go on the trampoline and have fun as long as he takes turns with other kids. \n\nTeach him how to navigate this stuff. Tell him it can be hard. Ask him how he feels about it. He'll learn to trust his instinct, negotiate his place in the world and build resilience. That's really valuable stuff to be learned at the playground. Even for you ;)", "NTA.

Op is NTA. That woman was totally unhinged and op handled it very well.

Let the other kid have it, then immediately say she has to get off since your kid is waiting. Horribly entitled people", "NTA and the other Mum was an AH. Sharing and turns are good practice if using communual property. But to be fair, then you can't walk up and demand that everyone yield to you because they need to share. Everyone deserves a realistic time to enjoy the swing, slide etc. She's not sharing her child to share. She's teaching her son to weaponise social politeness to passively-agressively get their own way. She will piss enough people off if she carries on like that that people will avoid her and her child which is sad for child. But she's not playing fair.", "Nta and i would let my kid stay on it for a half an hour out of spite.", "You were defending your son.  NTA here.", "NTA. That other parent is INSANE. Although if I was homeschooling my kid I\u2019d be bonkers too. Playground is a first come first serve. You don\u2019t want to hog something for hours, but most kids play on something for a few min and move on.", "Wow. Definitely NTA. That other parent was acting like a huge entitled AH", "NTA this is a difference between sharing and taking a turn. You can\u2019t share that equipment so it\u2019s a turn taking situation, and if the only reason why your child would  get off that equipment is because some other child wants a turn is not good turn taking. Part of turn taking is letting other children have their turn in peace. You wouldn\u2019t expect an adult to just get off let\u2019s say a park bench because another adult wants to sit there, so why would expect a child, who is younger and still growing emotionally, to do the same with the trampoline.  That child gets a turn when your child is done end of story. Waiting for a turn is just as important as giving other children a turn too.", "Nope, you were making sure it was fair for your son and others. This is extra clear with how she was literally having her child follow yours around to each new area to make him and you uncomfortable.\n\nI work with kids and so many areas on the playground require single use, like the swings (we have two single use swings, but more kids than that and swings are the favorite). When another kid wants to use it we pick an amount of time, set a timer, then have them switch off so they can have equal time. If a kid gets off for a moment then comes right back we explain that they left, but we can set a timer for them to have a new turn. This could be something worth trying in the future, just for the sake of having an actual set amount of time if another kid is waiting, but I have a feeling the other parent would\u2019ve popped off about that as well.\n\nYou\u2019re in the clear, the other parent is the one teaching her kid to be entitled, you were teaching yours that it\u2019s okay to want things fair for himself as well. There\u2019s a big difference there. You did great, like beyond great, with how you handled this. I only brought up what we do at work so that it\u2019s something you can use as a compromise with other parents who are willing to compromise, unlike the one you were dealing with at the park recently.\n\nGood luck, dealing with other adults is honestly why I work with kids. Sure, it\u2019s messy, but damn it\u2019s a lot easier to work with children than it is to work with other adults. Kids are great and everything is a learning experience, adults tend to be more egocentric than children as far as I can tell lol", "NTA.\n\nI had to un-teach the sharing thing to my daughter.  She would just keep getting pushed to the back of every line for everything she wanted to do by more aggressive kids.  And of course the moment she finally spoke up and said it was her turn on something, this exact type of parent who watched their kid push in front of her two or three times would start the whole, \"But you have to SHARE!\"  \n\nWhat they really meant was other kids have to give way to their kid and shut up.", "They were being unreasonable. If there\u2019s a line, set a timer and each kid gets like 3 minutes or whatever a reasonable amount of time is. If they aren\u2019t done, they can go back in the line and wait their turn again. Your kid was sharing, you were just enforcing that it\u2019s reasonable and fair to all kids", "No she was just being a bully. You needed to know your place so if she ever wants your things, you jump and give them her. I mean she's won already - you don't want to go back so one less competing child at the park.  I am glad you set a firm boundary with the wands though.", "This is exactly how it\u2019s done. You are behaving properly. She was not. You handled the entitled parent perfectly!", "Bring an egg timer with you. :)", "Yup, that\u2019s super clear based on her having her kid follow OP\u2019s son around to different areas.", "NTA. Just wait, the other parent will try to post here and call it \u201c AITA for teaching my kid sharing and kindness?\u201d", "NTA \n\nParents are the most entitled creatures on the planet.

Set a time for 5 minutes and when that is done, move to another piece of equipment. Stand there and protect your kid from other parents if you have to.

Did I miss a meeting? NTA.", "NTA, she must have had one too many coffees and wanted to have a pop at someone.", "NTA and what that mom wanted your kid to do was not sharing, but rather forcing him not to have any fun at all.", "NTA \n\nI am glad you had the bubble wand. That other child needed to learn that he can\u2019t just take from other children. He needs someone to teach him concepts such as \u201ctaking turns\u201d and \u201cnot yours\u201d and his mother is refusing to parent him.", "Awe! This is horrible! Your poor son, he probably felt so uncomfortable. Honestly, the woman was actively making her child (and herself) HARASS your son and you. If this happens again, I suppose I\u2019d advise to tell her to leave the 2 of you alone or you\u2019d report her for stalking/harassment. You are so NTA", "Honestly, sometimes parents should just let kids be kids. I'm sure the two of them would've either fought for it, or compromised, but in all cases, forgot about it in a few minutes. Kids are unpredictable like that. It's the parents that plant that seed of hate and resentment into kids so they project it on the others. Sounds like the other parent is TA, as they immediately stepped in and demanded their kid be given that trampoline.", "She should have called the police (or non emergency line) to report that she was being harassed at the playground. Let the other mother try to explain her behavior was all because OP wouldn't let her son go on the trampoline. Or she should have sat down with her son and waited it out. Was the other mother going to make her child sit down as well until OP moved? Or perhaps yell out \"this woman is stalking me and my son. I'm scared for my child- does anyone know who she is? '", "She was harassing you, trying to chase you away/punish you. I'm not certain if her being angry over the trampoline was what started it, or if she decided to target you as soon as she saw you and the trampoline was just step one.", "It is about an entitled parent who creates the idea of \u200b\u200bsharing arms with others"]}
