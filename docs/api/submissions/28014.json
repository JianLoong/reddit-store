Just my luck, my room was freezing cold, so I set up my heated blanket for Katie and I while my heater slowly heats up the room. \n\nWhen they were about to leave, Katie came running to me with the blanket, asking if she could take it home. The thing is, they have two dogs who ruin stuff in 2 seconds, while she doesnt take the best care of her stuff either (understantable since shes 8). \n\nI took nicely took it from her and said no in the nicest way possible. I told her that it was a birthday gift that Jasper gave to me. She looked disappointed but smiled. She's met Jasper, and aside from her parents and I, he's gotta be her favourite person, and he absolutely adores her.

I said again that it was a birthday gift from Jasper. They just said that I could've given it to her and Jasper or I could get another one. I don't wanna give it away since it was a birthday gift from my best friend, and he had a hilariously hard time getting it.
