It basically a red blanket that plugs in, you pick one of four settings and it auto shuts off after 3 hours so its not a fire hazard. Safe to say, I love this thing. I'm actually using it right now lol\n\nSo two days ago, my aunt and uncle and Katie came over for dinner. I asked Katie if she wanted to play a game on our switch, she excitedly said yes so we went up to my room and set it up to my TV. Just my luck, my room was freezing cold, so I set up my heated blanket for Katie and I while my heater slowly heats up the room. \n\nWhen they were about to leave, Katie came running to me with the blanket, asking if she could take it home. The thing is, they have two dogs who ruin stuff in 2 seconds, while she doesnt take the best care of her stuff either (understantable since shes 8). \n\nI took nicely took it from her and said no in the nicest way possible. I told her that it was a birthday gift that Jasper gave to me. She looked disappointed but smiled. She's met Jasper, and aside from her parents and I, he's gotta be her favourite person, and he absolutely adores her. (She's told Jasper and I that we need to get together and get married so that she can see him more often lol). \n\nShe ran to her parents and got her stuff on, and my aunt and uncle asked why I couldn't just give it to her. I said again that it was a birthday gift from Jasper. They just said that I could've given it to her and Jasper or I could get another one. I don't wanna give it away since it was a birthday gift from my best friend, and he had a hilariously hard time getting it. (He paid for it, but he had to ask his mother to order it, and tried his best to not mention that it was a gift for a girl, since you can probably tell how shed respond lol). \n\nI stood my ground and told them that I would not be giving it to them, and they just huffed and left. Later they texted me saying that I was an AH and I should've just given it to her. I was older, and I should've been the bigger person. The thing is, Katie had literally no problem with me saying no, so I have no idea what their problem was, but the way AH was thrown around it reminded me of this place.

And obviously NTA.", "You are NTA.  Your aunt and uncle on the other hand ate complete and utter entitled a##holes.", "NTA. Send them a link where they can buy the blanket if they so desperately need their daughter to have one. \n\nKatie is much more of an adult than her parents are.", "NTA\n\nI\u2019m gonna be crazy and assume that this is not literally the only electric blanket in the world. They can buy their kid one if she wants one.", "NTA, but it is perplexing how they raised a kid more mature than they are.", "Nta. You are not obligated to give away your things just because someone asks", "NTA. They are rude and entitled for demanding that you gave your birthday gift away. If they think Katie needs an electric blanket, they can buy her one.", "NTA, and the reason why you wouldn't give it to them doesn't even matter. Let Katie's parents buy her own heated blanket.\n\nAlso, the relationship between you and Katie is adorable", "NTA. \ud83c\udfb6 you can\u2019t always get what you want \ud83c\udfb6", "NTA. They want their daughter to have a heated blanket they're at liberty to buy her one. But then they're cheap skates who would rather take it from their 17 year old niece.

Why dont they buy her one if she needs/ wants one so bad..?\n\nThey sound insufferable tbh", "NTA - aside from the fact that you nicely said no \u2026. You need it bc your room is freezing ?!

Kids sometimes ask for things that they are not entitled to, because ya know they are kids.

Even your little cousin was able to understand why she couldn't have the blanket, the adults have no excuse.", "NTA. It was a birthday gift from YOUR friend. That alone is meaningful. They can buy Katie a headed blanket with their own money. Does her parent expect people to give Katie anything she wants just cause she\u2019s young? That\u2019s how kids end up being spoiled\u2026\n\nI really hope Katie doesn\u2019t learn from her parents. She\u2019s so much more mature than them, which is scary.

Your house, your car, your credit card, etc. As you said, gotta be a bigger person.\u201d \n\nJust to preface that I DO NOT recommend this.

I don't understand why any other reasons are necessary.", "From reading she's 8 and doesn't take great care of her things, she's got dogs that tear things up, and it was a birthday gift all 3 reasonable.

She didn't want to.\n2.  It's rude to give away a gift.\n3. It's rude to ask.\n4. It's rude to not take no for an answer.\n5.

Despite not going to that school previously, Jasper is allowed to pop in too and help. We're both done our service hours for this year so we're just doing it for fun/to help in general at this point.\n\nSo apparently I have to marry Jasper because almost every thursday and days he comes over isnt enough time for her lol.", "As is their relationship with Jasper", "It sounds like that's exactly what they're expecting you to do.  Explain why your personal possessions should belong to you instead of belonging to your cousin.  \n\nThis is an unreasonable level of coercion.  They are adults and should respect that your possessions belong to you.  They could easily get their daughter her own heated blanket."]}
