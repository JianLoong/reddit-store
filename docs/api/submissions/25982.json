Triplet boys (aged 15) and quintuplets (4 boys 1 girl, age 11). For the majority of parenthood, I have been working part-time and my husband worked full time. That meant I had more time with the kids obviously, and my husband mostly saw them on Sundays or evenings. \n\nBecause I had more time with them, I have been taking them on \u2018special days\u2019, where one kid gets a full day of just me and themself, for no special occasion. They get to go out to eat, go somewhere fun in the afternoon, they love it. I did it about once a year per kid. But the very beginning of this year, I began to work full time and my husband, part-time. The roles were essentially switched, and I\u2019ve had no time at all this year for special days, because of other celebrations in the family and spending my time off with the whole family together. None of the kids had their days yet and they seem disappointed, which I feel terrible about. \n\nHowever, tonight my husband told me he was thinking about doing father-son days, if it was all right with me, since I didn\u2019t have the time to. (He knows special days were important to me and he didn\u2019t want me to feel like he was taking it from me I guess) I said I didn\u2019t mind, but then noticed he only said \u201cfather-son\u201d. I reminded him he should take our daughter out as well, but he seemed less excited by that idea. He said he really just wanted to take the boys on their days because they shared interests. It is true our daughter is a girly-girl, and the boys are more \u201cboyish\u201d (lack of better words) but that shouldn\u2019t matter. \n\nIt really surprised me he was so against it, because he never treated our daughter differently than the boys (other than necessary) and never did anything like this before. I said she would feel really left out if she didn\u2019t get a special day with her dad, and he said it wouldn\u2019t be the same to him, because she would probably want to get her nails done or do makeovers and he didn\u2019t like that stuff. I said so what, and if he couldn\u2019t tough it out for one day with her, he shouldn\u2019t even be doing it for the boys. He got really moody after that and finally agreed to take her out too, but he\u2019s being kind of cold towards me tonight. \n\n(I want to clarify I didn\u2019t say he couldn\u2019t take just the boys or force him to do it, I just told him how it would make her feel and my opinion, and I didn\u2019t think I said it rudely) AITA? I think he should take her if he\u2019s taking everyone else, but maybe I could have worded it differently? Again, hes never acted differently towards her so that confused me, but he wouldn\u2019t tell me.", "created_utc": 1693544954, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/166xyps/aita_for_telling_my_husband_he_shouldnt_take_our/", "score": 37, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

First off, a father daughter pedicure and ice cream date would be lovely. Second off, there are other things they could do! Bowling, mini golf, laser tag, or\u2026.almost anything he could do with the boys? Luckily your daughter has brothers to look up to cuz her dads dropping the ball", "NTA. It's important to treat all your children equally, and it's fair that you raised your concern about your husband only planning father-son special days. You didn't do anything wrong in expressing your opinion. Your husband should be willing to spend quality time with each of your children, regardless of their interests or gender. It's a part of being a parent to meet their individual needs and create special moments. Your concern for your daughter's feelings is valid, and it's good that you advocated for her.", "NTA. \n\nShe's probably going to have a miserable time, and he's going to use that as an \"aha, told you so!\" Despite not trying to make it nice for her.\n\nShe's going to end up resenting dad for never caring enough About her to take an interest in the things she likes. I can't even imagine telling my child \"I'm not going to spend time with you because we don't like the same things\" as if she's some friend of a friend lmao.", "Definitely NTA - every point you made is correct and valid.\nHe should have already thought about how that would make his daughter feel. The fact that he doesn't want to do it because 'she might want to do something girly' is childish. You have a child who is female. She's going to want to do some girly things in her life and it's going to upset her when you're not as willing to join in with her antics as you are with your sons. \nYour husband needs to get over himself and be a father.", "NTA and he really is. He's making this all about himself and what makes him happy, when it should be about giving his time to the kids. The best dads put their own discomfort aside to do activities their daughters love; but even if he can't stomach that, he can certainly find something they both want to do once a year. I'm actually appalled that he doesn't see the problem with taking 7 OUT OF 8 KIDS out for special days.", "Your wording of our sons and my daughter is something I noted.  Does it feel that way?", "NTA  Even if your daughter does want to get her nails done, it\u2019s sad that your husband isn\u2019t even man enough to get a pedicure with his kid.", "NTA. He doesn't seem like much of a father if he can't spend one day doing something special with his only daughter. Especially since he only has a small window of time before she becomes a teenager and will drop him like a bad habit.", "NTA. Can't believe you had to force your husband to agree to treat his daughter equally and - gasp! - spend a single day with her too.", "NTA. Either all kids get special days or none do. That being said, at 11 your daughter is old enough to know different people have different interests so should be encouraged to do something they can both enjoy even if she'd enjoy getting her nails done more. It's not much of a special day if Dad's bored and pretending to have fun and it sounds like it's about time together just as much as it is doing a fun thing.", "NTA\n\nWhen her dad acts grumpy throughout daddy/daughter day, she's going to feel guilty and angry (or both) for taking up his time when he clearly doesn't want to be there. He can take her to the movies and something to eat. Find some sort of common interest. It's not hard.\n\nMy dad took me to see Pocahontas in the cinema for a day out (and he was all about sports and manly men stuff). He did fall asleep and his snoring was hilarious, but he put in the effort. I could tell the movie bored him but he went FOR ME. \n\nTell your husband to \"man up\" and go watch Barbie and grab some burgers with his daughter.", "NTA\n\nI don't know why an episode of Young Sheldon comes to my mind, where the Dad, who's a football coach and very much a good ol' boy takes his daughter out to a local restaurant for a meal.  The young daughter decides to dress like a princess, and Mom gives Dad a few quick tips on how to act the role of the gallant gentleman with her.  It's cute.\n\nWhat stands out for me about this scene is that Dad doesn't act girly with her.  He doesn't paint his nails. There's no scene of them side by side in comfy chairs with cucumber slices over their eyes or something.  Instead, with a bit of help, he finds a way to be himself (though perhaps an extra charming version) while allowing her to be herself (though perhaps an extra-princessy version).  Surely there's a way for your husband to take a similar approach, i.e. be himself while allowing her to be herself.", "My youngest (14 years) daughter is girly. Yes she loves getting her nails done. However one of the other things she loves to do is eat out somewhere nice. Even just a little cafe for 1 to 1 time.  She also loves games, and other things.\n\nMy point is, being girly (and with all those brothers, I bet she feels lovely being girly), is not all she is. She will enjoy more than just makeup. You husband should know she has other interests. She may enjoy attending a game with just her dad, or going to a zoo, or to watch a show, or the movies.   It does not have to be a choice between nails or fishing!!!", "NTA. \n\nIt doesn\u2019t matter that it wouldn\u2019t feel the same to him or that he doesn\u2019t like that stuff. It\u2019s literally not about him. \n\nHe shouldn\u2019t take any of them at this point because he clearly doesn\u2019t understand that it\u2019s not about him.", "NTA. She shouldn't be excluded because she has different interests.", "NTA but your husband is. So he wouldn\u2019t have fun ? Oh boohoo! He is her father. Of course she would feel left out. But he will probably not doing anything she likes because it is about him having a good day. Boys just share interest. He sucks", "NTA. Dear God, what is wrong with the man?", "NTA. You're absolutely correct. \n\nHow can he not realize that she'll feel slighted if he doesn't set aside days with her too? Is he really that oblivious? I don't think you said it unkindly, but I think you would have been justified if you had.\n\nI can only hope his moodiness is because he feels guilty and stupid for not having realized it himself. \n\nInstead of resenting you, he should be THANKING you for saying what you did.", "NTA She probably feels a bit left out already being the only girl with 7 brothers. Your husband needs to understand that it's not about what he wants, it's about making the children feel loved.", "NTA. If he actually doesn't do anything with her,  please on one of your days off you have a daughter mom date", "NTA.\n\nHonestly, your husband sounds like he has some stuff to unpack before it starts change your family. It always starts out small, and I'm not saying \"go get a divorce!\" but keep your eye on it. It's misogyny/toxic masculinity in a very subtle form.\n\nPeople can change, and heal from that kind of thing. It's possible, if you help bring it to their attention. Hopefully, if you do bring it up, he doesn't react negatively. If he does, that's a red flag to look out for.\n\nYou weren't rude, and were just trying to give some insight into how your kid would feel.", "NTA but that's a shit ton of kids. Id have stopped after having triplets. That way there's never any need for special days. Every child gets adequate time & care everyday.", "NTA but I understand the male bonding thing. Maybe dad was thinking that he could take the boys and you take your daughter for special days, and I get that. I don\u2019t think he was doing it with malice. And your weren\u2019t either. I think it pays to ask your daughter what she prefers, and maybe you both can compromise. Good luck.", "NAH He's feeling awkward because she's older\n\nYou could suggest activities not related to shipping and nails. Maybe that would get his imagination rolling.\n\nInstead of offering criticism, offer a solution.  Wouldn't you want his help with ideas if the situation was reversed?  Shouldn't your daughter have interests outside of her looks?", "It must be possible for him to come up with a list of activities that he would find at least tolerable, that she would also like? Just because she clings to traditionally girl things for her life due to being thrown in with so many brothers, doesn\u2019t mean that is her whole identity forever.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

The lessons he can teach her just by stretching beyond his comfort zone will last her lifetime. Maybe you can remind him that this is not about some uncomfortable time with his daughter. This is about modeling the man/person she may one day join her life to. Someone who loves her enough to do the things she is interested in even if they are not comfortable with it.

These are gifts a dad gives to a daughter by spending time with her and getting to know her.", "Nta\n\nI\u2019m the only daughter and I will willing admit that I grew up resenting my dad (and brothers) for all the quality guy time they spent together. I\u2019ve felt left out my whole life. I tried being interested in the same things as they are but it never worked. Now as adults I don\u2019t talk to my brothers and have no real relationship with them. When it comes to my dad it\u2019s a superficial relationship.

I\u2019m concerned about your husband minimizing women in this way, though. It\u2019s definitely coming across misogynistic. Just like boys aren\u2019t all about 2 things, neither are girls.

There\u2019s still room to compromise. Go ahead just write dad off. The sad thing is society has stuffed things up. There are fathers, and family members that won\u2019t have one on one experiences with their daughters. Because society dictates that something unseemly is going on. \u2026.. and yes some fathers think that!! They don\u2019t want to jeopardise themselves and the child. THAT can come into play too. I knew a solo father that would not allow his daughter to have sleepovers because of that. It could be a factor here. It\u2019s ok to judge, but the only ones that know this family\u2019s dynamics are the parents.", "If he thinks that way, he should tell his wife and daughter about these concerns.
