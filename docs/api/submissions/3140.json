I just do not have the mental and physical energy for that this year. We went shopping and got a small turkey, a few sides and the stuff to make two pies. \n\nToday I find out he bought another turkey yesterday and invited his family over for dinner. Even with the additional turkey, there isn\u2019t going to be enough food for everyone. I still wouldn\u2019t want to have this dinner if there was. \n\nI reminded my husband we had decided that it would just be us and our kids this year, that\u2019s what we\u2019d prepared for and what I expecting. I did not feel like or want to host dinner, so I asked him to call his family and let them know we were not hosting dinner today. I had already informed my side of the family soon after we\u2019d made the decision together. \n\nHe refused. Saying he thought I just didn\u2019t want to invite my family. I don\u2019t know how he came to that conclusion, since the discussion was \u201cjust us and our kids\u201d and that was what we had shopped for together. \n\nI told him if he chose to continue with having them over, I would stay in our room with a good book today or maybe go into the office to work. He would need to be responsible for the cooking and clean up. He responded that it would be rude for me to do that and he can\u2019t believe I wouldn\u2019t want to spend the time with him and our kids. \n\nI DO want to spend the time with our kids, though I\u2019m not 100% I want to spend it with him at the moment.

Take the kids and go to the movies and out to lunch.", "I\u2019d pack bags, take the kids, and have a fun few days at a nice hotel.

You would be cooking, cleaning, and hosting.", "NTA.  If I were you though I'd stay for the meal and let him do the cooking and the cleanup.

After the meal go visit your family.", "NTA\nHis family didn't want the hassle either.\nIt's tradition", "NTA, any chance of finding a new hotel room or BnB for the day? He invited them,  he can deal with them.", "NTA\n\nIf things can't be resolved I reccomend coming down with a sickness that lasts a couple of days. Headache and upset stomach are good ones that can't be disproved easily. Are are a great excuse for avoiding people.", "NTA.  Order yourself a nice meal and get out of the house.

If you are unable to enjoy it, there is no obligation to participate.\n\nI opted out of Christmas for 10 years... it sends a powerful signal, and might actually get your family to thinking about how they are treating you.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

There\u2019s a difference between spending time with family and being the one responsible for all the work associated with putting on a homemade dinner. You can still spend time with them, it just won\u2019t include food that you have prepared by your own hand.  I\u2019m not sure how he misunderstood when dinner this year was to just be your own children. That would have still occurred, but it\u2019s on him to feed the extended family he\u2019s personally invited.

What a mess.", "Well then you need to do what is necessary for your own mental health and if that means you go somewhere and bring a book then do it.
