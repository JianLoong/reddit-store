I just do not have the mental and physical energy for that this year. We went shopping and got a small turkey, a few sides and the stuff to make two pies. \n\nToday I find out he bought another turkey yesterday and invited his family over for dinner. Even with the additional turkey, there isn\u2019t going to be enough food for everyone. I still wouldn\u2019t want to have this dinner if there was. \n\nI reminded my husband we had decided that it would just be us and our kids this year, that\u2019s what we\u2019d prepared for and what I expecting. I did not feel like or want to host dinner, so I asked him to call his family and let them know we were not hosting dinner today. I had already informed my side of the family soon after we\u2019d made the decision together. \n\nHe refused. Saying he thought I just didn\u2019t want to invite my family. I don\u2019t know how he came to that conclusion, since the discussion was \u201cjust us and our kids\u201d and that was what we had shopped for together. \n\nI told him if he chose to continue with having them over, I would stay in our room with a good book today or maybe go into the office to work. He would need to be responsible for the cooking and clean up. He responded that it would be rude for me to do that and he can\u2019t believe I wouldn\u2019t want to spend the time with him and our kids. \n\nI DO want to spend the time with our kids, though I\u2019m not 100% I want to spend it with him at the moment.

There\u2019s a difference between spending time with family and being the one responsible for all the work associated with putting on a homemade dinner. You can still spend time with them, it just won\u2019t include food that you have prepared by your own hand.  I\u2019m not sure how he misunderstood when dinner this year was to just be your own children. That would have still occurred, but it\u2019s on him to feed the extended family he\u2019s personally invited.

It\u2019s been a discuss before and after every holiday event for years. They always say they will contribute and then don\u2019t.

What a mess.", "Well then you need to do what is necessary for your own mental health and if that means you go somewhere and bring a book then do it.  I wouldn't stay in the house because you would get dragged into it.", "take your kids to a hotel and a restaurant get someone else to  cook for you dont even bother telling just spring it on him like he did to you", "NTA- take the kids somewhere with you.  Send his family a group text that  you hope they have fun with husband's first attempt to cook a Thanksgiving dinner all by himself, but that you had plans to sped it with just your kids, and so only your husband will be attending.", "NTA - he is trying to force your hand. Go to the office or take the kids for something fun. DO NOTHING for thanksgiving dinner", "NTA\n\nYou had an agreement. He didn't respect it and deliberately backed you into a corner because you wouldn't refuse to move forward with hosting. This is not acceptable in a partnership. How the heck did he think everything was going to get done? Please take the kids and go do something fun for the entire day. If he gets away with this travesty, he will only get worse over time.", "NTA, but don't imprison yourself to your room, go out and have a day with your kids.

Then, you could have some pool time, watch movies in your room and have a lovely room service breakfast tomorrow.\n\nYour husband can stay home and entertain his guests on his own.", "Nta he chaned plans without clearing itwith you.

Don\u2019t worry about the fallout right now. Just go. \n\nHolidays were always loud and chaotic because they were always with the ILs. I finally put my foot down & we had 4 years of quiet meals in our pjs with just the 4 of us. I loved it.

You\u2019re NTA.", "\"He responded that it would be rude for me to do that\"\n\nNot nearly as rude as inviting a bunch of people over for a holiday gathering without involving your partner in the decision.

Your husband is lying when he pretends he didn't understand.", "/u/Solid-Revealz2170 - you are NTA and I agree with the other posters who said go to the office or find an activity that actually makes you happy. This is the first year I did not cook a Thanksgiving meal or go back to my home state to eat with my siblings and their families, etc. My two adult kids wanted to go so they went but the husband and I decided since this is the first time in a very long time that our vacations were at the same exact time and we just wanted to rest and be lazy and that's what I chose to do. I don't like most humans very much outside of my immediate married family. My family I was born and raised into - I love them all to pieces but this year I just wasn't feeling a whole yock of people in and out, unexpected greedy friends of the family, or long road trip to my home state then the trip back. I just wanted peace, no cooking, no cleaning, no expectations, just a carefree holiday. Today is day 3 of 5 and it has been absolutely lovely. Very Thankful for that on this paid Thanksgiving holiday. You don't know how much you miss being able to do that until you get the opportunity to do it and say I've missed this. \u2665\ufe0f\u2665\ufe0f\u2665\ufe0f I hope the rest of your holiday goes well.", "Why not take some time out for yourself during the day? Like, the time HE is cooking? \ud83e\udd23  It should be an enjoyable day for everyone so go re-energize when you need a break.", "Admit that you're OP's husband.", "I wouldn't even be thinking about *them* right now.  Your main problem is your husband and his dishonesty and manipulation.", "I love how that poster just ignores the lying, gaslighting husband as if that's no problem at all.", "Give you three guesses about that person...", "Nta", "NTA \nBut I wouldn\u2019t stay home, I\u2019d head out for a couple of days so he can\u2019t pressure you into participating", "NTA. You had an agreement and he changed the terms. If he wants his family over, he can cook and clean for them.", "Nope, NTA. Your husband can figure out dealing with any repercussions, because he brought it on himself.", "NTA, absolutely.  I hope you're deep into a good book right now or enjoying some peace and quiet at the office.\n\nIs your husband aware that he is letting *everybody* down?", "NTA. Don\u2019t help at all. Just hang out with your kids, watch tv and have a glass of wine (if that\u2019s your thing). If he starts asking for your help then tell him HE wanted to host for HIS family so it\u2019s on him this year to prepare dinner and also say that this is a great time for his family to help out since they\u2019ve promised to help out. If he complains or gets mad don\u2019t give in. Hold your ground and tell him it wasn\u2019t respectful of him to invite his family without discussing it with you and also assuming you\u2019d host it all.", "NTA, but how many of these posts are you going to write about your husband treating you like crap before you wise up that this isn't the guy for you?", "NTA. Why is it your responsibility to cook for people he invited over?", "NTA. *Rude* is inviting your whole family over and expecting someone else to cook. Rude is *not* refusing to cook for a party you didn\u2019t plan.", "NTA. Why is it so hard for some people to just tell family no? People make things so much harder than they need to be. I\u2019m so thankful my family & my husbands family are normal. \u263a\ufe0f", "The enter button is a thing. It makes paragraphs.", "Or OP's MIL, lol.", "I apologize about not having any paragraphs, I was just trying to get out my thoughts and I just didn't bother TBH.
