I don't like most humans very much outside of my immediate married family. My family I was born and raised into - I love them all to pieces but this year I just wasn't feeling a whole yock of people in and out, unexpected greedy friends of the family, or long road trip to my home state then the trip back. I just wanted peace, no cooking, no cleaning, no expectations, just a carefree holiday. Today is day 3 of 5 and it has been absolutely lovely. Very Thankful for that on this paid Thanksgiving holiday.

He did call and tell his family that we were postponing dinner until Saturday. I think because he realized that second turkey was still frozen solid and not happening. So I did not leave. However, a few of his family members still showed up. \n\nI got roped into making the mashed potatoes and deviled eggs because he \u201cdoesn\u2019t know how.\u201d I also kind of got forced into a few conversations with his sister because she kept following me around which was exhausting. He cooked the rest of the sides and did at least make everyone wait while I made my plate first and he made our kids\u2019 because there definitely wasn\u2019t enough food. \n\nEveryone has left but his sister and her boyfriend.

To which he said if he gives me the hour break then I\u2019m on my own with putting them to bed. \n\nNow I\u2019m in my room and I hear him banging around in kitchen while talking to his sister and her boyfriend. Fingers crossed that\u2019s him cleaning up.

The only way to 'win' that kind of manipulative positioning (either she does all the work *and* has to deal with the obnoxious people, or looks like a terrible no-good meanie who hates family) is to not be there and let the consequences fall entirely on him.

Stay out of the kitchen and play with the kids.", "NTA", "> He responded that it would be rude for me to do that \n\n... I'm sorry, no. \"Rude\" is volunteering someone else's labor without them knowing.  What you're doing is setting a healthy boundary in response to *his* rudeness.

Apparently he lied to you when you thought you had an agreement. I would ask what other things he has agreed to but lied? Wedding vows, perhaps? So when are you supposed to know when he lying? \n\nAs a hubby myself, I'd expect to be warming the couch for the foreseeable future for this egregious breach of my partnership. I would never expect my wife to follow my orders or jump on my whim. Honestly I would be also considering my actions and probably donating the turkey to a food bank while cancelling with my family.

That cannot be allowed, ever.", "You didn't get \"roped into\" making things. Instead of letting him fail and reap the consequences of his own choices, you bailed him out. I can understand - I have had to learn not to do this and it took therapy to drive it home. I implore you to learn this too. If he blatantly lies to you and tries to do something similar, either stand strong with your boundaries of not helping or leave with your kids (or on your own) to do something else.", "This sounds like weaponized incompetence. When my husband attempts to guilt trip me or corner me into something I don't want to do- I straight up call him an asshole for not respecting me saying no, and tell him I am no longer available to him other than to address the conflict or participate in previously agreed to responsibilities for the duration of his abusive behavior. I also tell him that if he would like talk about it that I need an apology and an explanation as to how this behavior is not going to be repeated. I explain to him that he has devalued and discarded his partner, and he will experience those consequences until he's ready to make it right. This method has been effective in my marraige for maintaining self worth, boundaries, freedom of choice between both partners, and allows him to miss me in a constructive setting.", "I apologize if this is too harsh.\n\nBut you need to stand up for yourself.\n\nYou told him you wouldn\u2019t do anything and.......you helped him out!!!\n\nStop doing that!!!!\n\nHe doesn't know how to make/do something?

If I were you I would head out early.  Sorry these plans are in play and have fun.", "Completely endorse this!", "And start putting the plan in writing and emailing it to him and to yourself, so he can't gaslight you later with \"that's not what we agreed to.\"", "> This sounds like weaponized incompetence.\n\nOf course it is.  He doesn't know how to look up how to do stuff online?  BS.", "It makes it difficult, but it doesn\u2019t make it impossible. \n\nAlso as a child of parents who honestly did not have a healthy relationship and took WAY too long to divorce\u2026 do it for your kids. \nThe divorce was hard. It sucked at times. But life was SO MUCH BETTER after.\n\nYou are worth SO MUCH and your husband is not treating you like that. \n\nI would look into getting a therapist and start talking through all that you feel. \n\nRemember that your kids are looking at you for how to behave. I didn\u2019t have a good example of a healthy relationship, and I honestly think that contributed to me first relationship being an emotionally and mentally abusive one. \n\nPlease, OP.

There was no ambiguity. He knew what the agreement was and he deliberately waited until the last minute to spring it on you that he \"misunderstood\". When he realised his plan hadn't worked because of his ineptitude with the turkey, he made sure to try and force you to do it again in a couple of days.\n\nHe made you cook and entertain today. Deliberately. Knowing full well how much you did not want to.\n\nIf he had thought you agreed to his family coming, he wouldn't have thought he needed to buy another turkey.

The fact that he knew a larger turkey would be needed to accommodate his family means he always knew this was his plan. He just didn't think you'd not cave.\n\nAs it is you did cave as much as the thawed meat quantity allowed.\n\nHe lied to you. He manipulated you. He disrespected you. He disregarded you.

Just tell him to contact his family and ask them all to bring a side dish.", "So OP what did you end up doing ?", "NTA.\n\nHe wants his family over, cool, he can host. You already made your stance on this year's Thanksgiving clear, hell, you two had a discussion and an agreement in no uncertain terms that this year would just be you two and your kids.\n\nSomething I've noticed though, does he have a problem with your family? Seems suss that he would be okay inviting his family after \"assuming\" you didn't want your family over.", "This is obviously a situation where there's a communication problem far deeper than this thanksgiving. If you want to save this marriage, you need to start talking to your husband. If you value this relationship, it might be better to suck it up and help host and have a serious conversation with him afterwards. On the other hand, obviously you're NTA in this situation and if this is the culmination of much deeper problems, maybe this is a reasonable time to end it all.", "To be honest this doesn't sound like a marriage. This is more like people that barely can stand each other. Are you sure you guys love each other?\n\nI you think there are still feelings left, I would go to couples counseling. But he seriously is manipulative and sounds more like a competitor than your husband.", ">\u201clet me guess you\u2019re touched out ...\n\nThis isn't about bedtime... well not the kids bedtime anyway. This is him not only lying and bullying you into complying, but also a preemptive strike to let the family know that you probably wont be putting out, so they can help bully you into that too.", "\"did at least make everyone wait while I made my plate first and he made our kids\u2019 because there definitely wasn\u2019t enough food.\"\n\nYou made his family wait to ensure you ate before them in case there wasn't enough food?

How would that affect the kids? I mean, unless I'm missing something, he's the only asshole here but you'd be punishing the kid's paternal grandparents for that, too. And if the kids actually want to have dinner with them, you could be putting them in a position of choosing between you and their dad. This is kind of a 'find the least harm for the kids' scenario. I'd participate on the condition that he did all the cooking and cleaning, then start couples therapy after thanksgiving to deal with his passive aggressive stunt. Well, unless his parents are unreasonable and it will get ugly. Side note: My SIL makes all the dinners since I live in a really small place where there's just no room, and if she says she doesn't want to, we just don't--or we order pizza instead of turkey.

If there us some part of preparing or hosting that you are OK with (maybe those mashed potatoes and deviled eggs? Or something else)? Offer to help with that, then remove yourself from the rest of it, including cleaning up. Tell him in advance.

He still got you to cater to him and his family and still gets his bag family dinner on Saturday. And he gaslit you for the little bit if the agreement you held to.

That's not healthy either. NTA but not that many options for ways to handle it that doesn't leave someone hurt.", "Not everything is deeper. Their marriage isn\u2019t in jeopardy.
