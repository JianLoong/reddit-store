Since the breakup I\u2019ve been reflecting on all the instances of him being subtly pushy and controlling, and I wanted to know Reddit\u2019s opinion on this one.

That means work requirements are a priority - arriving rested, using work mandated travel arrangements, etc. I understand he wanted to travel together, but he wasn\u2019t getting that your inviting him for the first part of the trip was a courtesy. He could have met up with you later just fine. Now that you know who he is and what he values, take the time to consider if this is someone you want to be with.
