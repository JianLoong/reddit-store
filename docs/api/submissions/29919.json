It does not fix problems,  it does not stop bad things from happening, it does not protect people. All it does reinforce bad behaviour.\n\nYour mother has enabled your father all these years and all it has done is help him feed his addictions. If you send money now you would only be doing the same. You would also be enabling your mother to carry on enabling your father and so the cycle continues. It has to end.\n\nSending this money wont protect your mother it will only show him that if he can't get money from her, she will find a way to get it from you to give to him he will use this time and time again.\n\nI am sorry sorry for this very difficult situation OP. If you fear for your mothers safety you should inform the police and try fi you can to get her to speak to a professional to help her come to a point in which she feels able to leave.", "NTA  Your mom has spent years being an enabler.  Nothing will change until she has had enough and is willing to set herself free.  You not only did not have the money but were also brave enough to tell your mom that she had been a huge part of the problem for years.  Listen to your boyfriend when he tells you that you did a good job standing your ground because you did.  I understand why you feel awful because you love your mom but in the long run it might be what she needed to hear.  Even if she never finds the courage to divorce him you have put her on notice that you will not be a part of helping continue this vicious cycle.  You have done absolutely nothing wrong and if anyone tells you otherwise do not listen to them.  You should be proud of yourself.", "Nta", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I know that your mom may be caught up in some fucked up abusive dynamics, and \"just leaving\" is never as easy as people make it sound. However, she has no right to get you involved in any of it.
