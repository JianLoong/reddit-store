It's not so much the fact that he's had sex before marriage. It's the fact that he lied to you about it for your entire relationship, then even tried to lie about it AGAIN when you confronted him. He clearly isn't an honest person, and I wouldn't be surprised if he was hiding other secrets from you, too.", "NTA. It's about a couple of things. First of all, he lied to you, and then tried to feed you a story when you confronted him about it.\n\nSecond, when the truth about his lies came out, he enlisted the members of the church to use peer pressure on you to force you to see things his way, as opposed to working this out privately, or seeking couple's counseling. Basically, he was bullying you into backing down, and he got the whole church to help him do it.\n\nYou've gotten a glimpse into your future, after you are married, as to what he will do if you have a disagreement, and it isn't pretty.", "NTA it\u2019s not about the sex, it\u2019s about the lies and hypocrisy. It\u2019s fine if he\u2019s ashamed of his past and didn\u2019t want to go into details, but to repeatedly present himself as someone who has never had sex when apparently he had enough that his friends were well aware of it makes him an AH.", "I wouldn't be mad about the premarital sex, I'd be pissed that he is telling everyone else about your private business.  Just my first thought.", "NTA. If your fianc\u00e9 doesn't feel comfortable enough with you to talk about his past and feels the need to lie about it, maybe it's best to reconsider. If he lies about that, what will be the next lie ?", "NTA HE LIED TO YOU.", "NTA. You clearly don't know him as well as you thought you did. That's enough to make anyone have second thoughts.\n\nIn my experience, highly religious people are quite likely to be hypocritical, to keep secrets, and to publicly condemn others for sins they themselves commit in private.\n\nI'm not saying you should force him to confess every deep, dark secret he has, but you absolutely should put things on hold until you think you understand how he things and are able to trust him.\n\nDo any of his friends think he has added to his \"roster\" while you've been dating?\n\nWhen trying to rebuild trust, one question you might ask your partner is, \"What question are you most afraid I'm going to ask you right now?\" Watch their face. See if you think you can trust their answer. You don't even need to force them to answer the question. Instead, you can ask things like, \"Why would you be afraid to tell me that answer?\" Or, \"Why don't you want to talk to me about that topic?\"\n\nETA: Sometimes, the most overtly religious people are the ones you are least able to trust. Pastor's kids, for example, know all the right words to say but often behave the worst out of some need for rebellion and individuality. Do not take your fianc\u00e9's word (or those of the people he asked to speak to you) at face value.", "Nta. Run run now. There are so many red flags it\u2019s not even funny. He lied. He continued to lie until he got caught. THEN he brought multiple other people into this to throw religion in your face as to why you should stay together. I would strongly suggest going to your next church service and thank them all for showing you exactly how toxic the relationship was AND how toxic this church is. Listen I\u2019m a Christian but this sounds like a cult.", "NTA.   The dishonesty is very concerning.   To lie about something so important \\*to him\\* and make it a pivotal part of your relationship does not speak well of his character and will make it difficult for you to ever trust him.", "NTA\n\nWhile premarital sex is the topic at hand, it sounds like the real issue is trust.\n\nHe violated it when he lied about not having sex before when you ask him point blank.\n\nHe violated trust when he jumped the gun and told others of your issue. That violation in particular is compounded and moves into the realm of manipulation because he likely knew you enough you\u2019d be going to a service.\n\nYou need to out the engagement on hold ask if this trust can be earned again or if the damage is done.\n\nAs for the Christian rhetoric he and others in your group are likely to express. You can forgive him but still not trust him again. If you can\u2019t trust him, you shouldn\u2019t marry him.", "NTA red flags everywhere get out while you still can.  1. If he is willing to lie to you about that, he can and probably has lied to you about other things. 2. Him using other people to try and convince you not to be mad and/or humiliate you is very manipulative. 3. He doesn't think he did anything wrong - in his eyes god already forgave him, & so you should be over it already - which is a crock of steaming poop.  He isn't trustworthy, and stinks of narcissism.  IMO the only way you'd be the ahole would be if you stayed with this guy.", "NTA. He just wanted YOU to wait til marriage. He considered himself exempt from this, which unless he turned over some huge new leaf or something, is extraordinarily sexist.", "NTA he lied to you and now he\u2019s trying to get the church to convince you that you\u2019re the one who\u2019s doing something wrong. Not okay", "NTA Ugh. Do you think those church busybodies would be talking to him about repentant sinners if YOU were the one with the roster? If you had been lying to him since day 1, do you think he\u2019d say \u201cOh well. That was in the past.\u201d\n\nThe problem isn\u2019t that he had sex before you. The problem is that he lied about it reporting and really misrepresented himself. He is not at all who he has been pretending to be.\n\nDo not marry this controlling liar.", "Nta\n\nThe issue isn't the premarital sex. \n\nThe issue is that he's a giant hypocrite. \n\nSomeone that actual repented for something that thought was wrong world never consider previous partners a \"roster\". Someone that was as religious as he pretends to be wouldn't be lying to their partner, because that goes against the whole \"honor thy partner\" thing as well. \n\nHe plans on starting your life together, in the eyes of *his* god mind you, with a lie.\n\nEdit to add- he sees you as another member of his roster.", "NTA he lied to you, persuaded you to join his church on false pretences (I am glad you are finding value in it, but he lied to get you to join), and built your expectations for marriage on lies. It shows he is willing to tell detailed prolonged lies when it\u2019s to his advantage and that he has a double standard (your purity is important, his is apparently not).", "Well so let's just set the sex aside and look at the fact that he was straight up willing to start your married life of with a lie. And then go to what was he going to do when he was with his friends? Talk about how he pulled the wool over his naive virginal brides eyes?\n\nTheir the whole damn man out NTA", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHe LIED to you for all of your relationship. The thing itself would not have been a big issue, but now you know he lies to you, and he only admits things after you catch him and nail him down. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**The problem is: What else is he lying about?**", "NTA. You\u2019re upset he lied and not because he had sex in the first place, which is a very reasonable response. You gave him the chance to own up to it and he didn\u2019t; of course you\u2019d be reconsidering your wedding.", "NTA\n\nWhy would he lie about that? Is he calling dibs on your virginity?\n\nWhat made him stop having sex or did he at all?? \n\nAnd definitely what else is he lying about shamelessly?\n\nHe took away any threat and competition, you feel for him and his religion that he didn\u2019t even respect. You\u2019d be raising kids for this man, no other experience, in his faith - totally oblivious if he was sleeping around or what he truly believes.\n\nI\u2019d definitely put off any wedding.", "There's two main issues here. His lying, and the fact he didn't honour your request for time to think, and instead send people to hound you for the wanted result. Regardless of my stance on premarital sex, those seem sufficient to rethink the marriage. NTA", "NTA\n\nThe fact that he LIED to a direct question.  Wow.\n\nLying is as much a sin as fornication.  He was prepared to dam his soul rather than be honest with his wife to be.\n\nThen he brought in others to pressure you and didn\u2019t tell them that he had lied to a direct question either.\n\nThe sex shows he is two faced.  But the lying makes him completely untrustworthy.", "NTA\n\ud83d\udea9 lied to you about being inexperienced in sex. \n\ud83d\udea9 when confronted out the discussion you heard lied again. \n\ud83d\udea9 took your personal business to his buddies to persuade you to capitulate to his wants when you had told him you wanted time to think about your feelings.", "NTA", "NTA, he lied to you multiple times that you know of. What else is he lying about? Instead of giving you the space that you asked for, he disrespected that and went to church goers telling them about what happened.  His version, I'm guessing, he lied to them. Then they approached you, which I'm sure he asked them to. \nHe's an AH. You deserve better.", "NTA. Put on the brakes. Hit the pause button. \nNot only did he lie and enlist his church to pressure you, but he\u2019s dismissing your legitimate concerns!  Nope. This is not the action of a partner for life. Re-read what you wrote. Is this what you want?  Please step back and think long and hard. Best of luck to you.", "NTA. I can understand why he thought it would hurt you. I can understand if he had a past and decided that he wanted to wait until marriage for the next time he had sex.  What I can\u2019t understand is why if this is now a big deal to him, why would he talk to his buddies about his \u201croster?\u201d  Why couldn\u2019t he have just said, \u201cI\u2019m not a virgin but I have decided that I would wait for marriage to have sex again.\u201d  The fact he would discuss this with his church is very odd. The fact that he could lie to you with a straight face means he is good at lying and probably knows it.  I know there is definitely context missing and I don\u2019t know how the other aspects of your relationship are, but as written, I definitely do not trust the guy.", "NTA. This isn't about premarital sex, this is about him lying. He lied to you about wanting to wait until marriage and when you find out he has a roster, he tries to make you feel like it isn't an issue. Then he gets church members to try and manipulate you into seeing his perspective. Run! \ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9", "NTA\n\nYour fiance was manipulating you, plain and simple. His continued attempts to lie were at least continued attempts to manipulate. \n\nYou could stay with him, but he's going to keep lying to you.", "NTA. You can't always expect people to live by your own values, but I wouldn't trust someone who didn't live by their OWN values.", "NTA.     Red flags all over the place here, as others have said.      If you marry this guy, understand that nothing in your marriage will ever be his fault or responsibility, even if it is.    He'll just tell you it's not a big deal and you're overreacting.", "It has almost nothing to do with his past sex live at this point. Red flags everywhere.\n\n1. He lied, only telling the truth when he had nowhere to hide\n2. He hasn\u2019t apologized for lying. Everyone has a past, but this is his present reality. \n3. He brought in orders to influence your decision, not giving you time to process and not even acknowledging his wrong.\n\nRun for the hills. This isn\u2019t a red flag, it\u2019s a tent. Hes likely lying about other stuff as will", "Go to a marriage therapist.  If you love him then give it another chance.", "NTA. But neither is he ?
