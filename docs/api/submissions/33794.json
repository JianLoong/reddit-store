No, *he* should apologize to her for neglecting to make it clear to you and your brother *years ago* that he sees her grandkids as his, too. If that is, indeed, the case.

You were explicitly excluding her.\n\nI understand there can be a lot of bad blood in blended families, and I understand that it must have been gut-wrenching for you growing up with your dad drifting away with another woman. But it is \\*always\\* the wiser, bigger-person behavior to err on the side of inclusiveness.\n\nEven if you think about it from purely selfish perspective: double the family means double chances for help with the new baby, double the gifts, double the siblings your kid can safely play with. There is literally nothing to gain - and so much to lose - when we snub people around us.\n\nIf I was you I\u2019d call/text her privately, and tell her you didn\u2019t mean to snub her. That you are looking forward to your kid having all these cousins!

Even though gf is clearly in the wrong, trying to tell her off or get an apology out of her will inevitably make the situation worse.", "NTA\n\nYour dad's girlfriend's reaction is Phi-lthy dramatic.

I\u2019d even agree that I am excluding her, but because that\u2019s how we\u2019ve always operated? Our families have always been separate which has worked out fine until now. I\u2019m not sure that she even wants a blended family or to be involved with my baby, I think just wants my dad to see himself as part of her family which is understandable. definitely considering reaching out to clear the air. Thank you!", "INFO what did your dad do when he had to pay more child support was he mad about it? Why havent they gotten married since they've been together for so long.", "He was stressed about paying it but wasn\u2019t mad afaik. My mom offered to do 50/50 custody instead of child support but my dad didn\u2019t think 3 kids + his girlfriend under one roof would work out well.\n\nI\u2019m not sure why they\u2019re not legally married. Might be a financial thing since she doesn\u2019t work and is on gov\u2019t assistance so if they were married she\u2019d probably lose benefits."]}
