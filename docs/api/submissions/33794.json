She's been cruel to OP and siblings. Op isn't putting anyone down. Merely stating facts.", "Exactly!!", "I agree. Also, the girlfriends grandchildren are between the ages of 9-13. They\u2019ve been together 15 years. It doesn\u2019t sound like the girlfriends kids even lived with OPs father at all.", ">there's no bond of marriage\n\n15 years as partners, that's longer than the father was with his first wife. \n\n>the gf made it clear that his family isn't hers\n\nNo, op made it clear that she doesn't care for the partners family. That doesn't mean fathers partner doesn't count them as family .\n\n>She's been cruel to OP and siblings\n\nOp never gave any examples of this, op also admitted that from the start she hated the girlfriend. Op only talks about the child support and well I doubt op as a kid had a good or unbiased understanding of any of those issues. \n\n>Op isn't putting anyone down\n\nOp has made it clear that she went from hating the gf to not caring. Must suck for the father to have his life split in two", "Exactly. At best he's a trusted adult in the gf's family, but I doubt her kids see him as their parent.", "Seems like the gf made a big deal about the dad supporting his own damn kids. She's not particularly likeable I'd bet. She's keeping her crap attitude even though she was an interloper and made no effort to be a part of OP's life other than as a resource leech. Regardless of the fact they've dated 15 years, the gf isn't a part of family member to OP and her kids are not legally entwined with the dad. He's got some connection to the gf's grandkids perhaps, but they're not his.", "NTA\n\n\\*If\\* your dad plays the role of grandpa to his gf's grandchildren, it's not your fault that you didn't know. You're intentionally kept in the dark about all that because his gf is unreasonable. Your dad's obligation to support his children did not prevent them from buying a home - their desire to live a lifestyle they could only afford if he neglected his obligations is what kept their dream home out of reach. I pay CS, I bought a home - it's all about accepting your adjusted budget and living within your means. She didn't want that. She wanted the resources you were entitled to as a minor to be redirected to her, an adult who had no claim to your dad's money. \n\nI think she set the cold tone to this relationship years ago and is now mad that you all know jack squat about it, even though this dynamic was set up to appease her and her temper.", "It's kinda funny because I remember something very similar from different perspective where people where shitting on the \"first baby\" person for insisting that step grandkids were not \"real grandkids\", and that hers were the \"first\".\n\nIt was a little different with how close the family was in that other post, it's funny to see everyone here saying \"they are not his real grandkids, you did nothing wrong\".\n\nI agree with the husband that it's probably just a brain fart awkward moment, and there's really nothing wrong with whatbop did, but I would still shoot a text saying sorry to the girlfriend, since of you really didn't mean any offense, it should make you feel a little bad if you indeed offended someone", "NTA and your child is your dad\u2019s first grandchild. Your stepmonster just comes off as petty and bitter. Why would she ruin the moment like that and make it all about her? I wouldn\u2019t apologize because you\u2019ve done nothing wrong. She should apologize for acting like that but I highly doubt she\u2019d do that. Congratulations on your little one. I hope your dad\u2019s gf doesn\u2019t try to come between your babys\u2019 future relationship with your father.", "NTA. That IS his first actual grandchild. You aren't wrong on that at all. There's a reason she's still a girlfriend 15 years later..", "Nta. She\u2019s a girlfriend not a wife so the grandkids don\u2019t even have any legal or familial (bc they call him by his first name) claim. Idk what her point is.", " NAH you might not have a relationship with her kids but that doesn\u2019t mean your dad doesn\u2019t consider her family his family. I could see why she\u2019d take it personally, but it doesn\u2019t sound like you did it with malicious intentions.\n\nI think it\u2019s kind of weird people are getting hung up on the fact they aren\u2019t married, but they\u2019ve been together 15 years. It sounds like it would be both of their second marriages. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s that weird that they didn\u2019t want to get married again, but they are obviously in a committed relationship.", "NTA.\n\n15 years and still just a girlfriend; her kids use his first name; even he stepped in at the moment and told her \"we'll talk later\". \n\nYou have nothing to apologize for. Clearly she's still feeling some kinda second place way, and she's the one who tried to fire up the drama in this situation.\n\nCongrats on the baby!", "NTA\n\nIt is the first in your immediate family.  Unless he\u2019s adopted her kids, nothing to be mad at.", "Surely it's your mum's first grandbaby too? Why does the world revolve around how things you do affect this woman?", "NTA. Everyone blaming the Op for making it a big deal would have supported her had she been in her teens and the step parent forced a blended family on them, while being disgruntled over child support?\n\nAnybody asking her to be a bigger person, would you have been in this scenario when not only does your father choose his gf and his family over us, his gf has a problem with the child support he is paying to do his duty as a father so whenever you invite your father it has to be done without her because she doesn't want a blended family, so not only is she never invited, she never makes any effort of relationship and hates you because she and her kids can't enjoy the cash that is being sent to you.\n\nI don't get people who are advising her to be forgiving. You don't know the extent of cruelty. You weren't there in her teens when she didn't see her father because he chose his gf and family over them. And the step mother had a problem with child support. \n\nEveryone is needlessly forgiving just because she is 25 now and the stepmother is not overtly abusive.", "You\u2019re assuming your whole family, not just your father, feels the same as you do about your stepmother and your stepsiblings. It\u2019s a wild assumption.\n\nI\u2019ll tell you from the perspective of a stepfather, I absolutely think of my stepson as my own, and as far as I\u2019m concerned he\u2019s the same blood as my own kids. \n\nYou\u2019re the A in this, and from what you\u2019ve said, that\u2019s obvious to your family, they just don\u2019t want to bother arguing it.", "They aren't even married, so technically not step anything. Not stepmother, step grandpa. Just.. not.", ">Even if she was a shit to you as a kid maybe things can change and you can embrace her as a special person in your kids life.\n\n\nI\u2019m sorry but the lady who complained about OP\u2019s dad paying child support is not going to be a grandmother to OP\u2019s kid, she won\u2019t be a special person in OP\u2019s kids\u2019 lives. Her grandkids will not be cousins to OP\u2019s kids.", "It will be OP\u2019s Dad\u2019s first biological child. Step grandkids or not, it is OP\u2019s Dad\u2019s first Grandkid.", ">Still, acting the bigger and the magnanimous person gives you sort of a superpower\n\nNo it doesn\u2019t."]}
