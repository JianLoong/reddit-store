I hadn't been to the volunteer session since the whole incident happened and I was mostly over it. I contacted a few other classmates and they basically told me that the guy I had the issue with did the same thing to all of them, the only difference was that I actually ran into the guy in person so that's what made it super awkward.\r  \n\r  \nI emailed the event coordinator earlier today because I was interested in volunteering this weekend and next weekend and I wanted to make sure that guy wasn't already on the schedule.\r  \n\r  \nTurns out he was there last weekend and he had an absolute meltdown against one of the other volunteers. I don't have any specifics but apparently it was bad. They told him to leave the premises and he isn't allowed back. One of my new friends from the bar incident saw it happen and the guy just lost his mind without any provocation. I'll get more details this weekend.\r  \n\r  \nSo I guess the issue is resolved. I am still extremely confused, but I am just going to move on.", "created_utc": 1695251150, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16nzj1d/update_aita_guy_i_went_to_school_with_refused_to/", "score": 646, "replies": ["I'm glad you waited this out, because it sounds like the organization will benefit more from having you than from having him.

One time, this volunteer decided that she was going to do her own thing and messed everything up. When I talked to her (as a supervisor), she told me that what we were doing was stupid and that she could open her own foundation and do a better job. She lasted less than 1.5 hours.", "I've been a volunteer for a non profit tall ship (19th century sailing chip) for a decade and we've fired a number of volunteers over the years.   Few things people have done:\n\n* Stole alcohol from the locked alcohol locker (by climbing over a 2.5 meter tall wall).  Denied it was him when shown the CCTV footage but he was the only one on board that night and the footage matched him exactly. \n\n* A new female volunteer with only a few weeks experience, didn't get assigned one of the plum jobs and retaliated by formally accusing one of the longtime male members of sexual harassment.  Numerous female members acted as character witnesses that this guy would never do anything like that, so we kicked the accuser out for the false accusations. \n* repeatedly not turning as promised and therefore threatening our ability to carry out our mission. These people get \"fired\" by finding themselves no longer invited to future activities. Surprisingly this is way too common - we offer many ways to get in touch if something comes up last minute - but people won't give us the courtesy of letting us know. \n\nThe retirees who are the core of the organisation are now suspicious of working age volunteers who have lots of free time during the week. Are you only here because you can't hold down a job?", "My personal bet would be whatever seemed to trigger the melt down in the moment was just an everyday normal thing and he said something you really can't take back in a public setting and it was a bit 'we can have someone that goes off like that here' issue because it would risk losing other volunteers"]}
