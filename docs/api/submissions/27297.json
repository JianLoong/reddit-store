I hadn't been to the volunteer session since the whole incident happened and I was mostly over it. I contacted a few other classmates and they basically told me that the guy I had the issue with did the same thing to all of them, the only difference was that I actually ran into the guy in person so that's what made it super awkward.\r  \n\r  \nI emailed the event coordinator earlier today because I was interested in volunteering this weekend and next weekend and I wanted to make sure that guy wasn't already on the schedule.\r  \n\r  \nTurns out he was there last weekend and he had an absolute meltdown against one of the other volunteers. I don't have any specifics but apparently it was bad. They told him to leave the premises and he isn't allowed back. One of my new friends from the bar incident saw it happen and the guy just lost his mind without any provocation. I'll get more details this weekend.\r  \n\r  \nSo I guess the issue is resolved. I am still extremely confused, but I am just going to move on.", "created_utc": 1695251150, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16nzj1d/update_aita_guy_i_went_to_school_with_refused_to/", "score": 60, "replies": ["I'm glad you waited this out, because it sounds like the organization will benefit more from having you than from having him.  Thanks for updating!", "Thanks for the update - sounds like he's got something going on in his life and I doubt it's good. I'm now super curious about what the meltdown situation was!", "Sounds like the dude has issues to sort out, likely of the mental health variety, and should be focusing on that instead.\n\nIt's not your problem any more which is good, but I do hope he gets the help he needs for the issues he is having. His behaviour still sounds bizarre to me like he is having a persecution type of delusion or something.\n\nBut he could have also just changed for the worst, that sometimes happens to people.", "Thanks for the update!
