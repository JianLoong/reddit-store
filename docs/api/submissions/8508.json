They refused to take money for rent, but I did all the food shopping.", "How old is your daughter? She could get her own place.", "NTA  \n\n\nIt's your house. If she still lived with her boyfriend and you came over and asked for a bigger room that she worked in, you know she'd say no. You're the one paying the bills and running the house.

To earn the money that keeps that room and all the rooms in that house available for you guys.   \n\n\nYou did your job as a parent by raising her and housing her. She moved out and made a decision not to move with her boyfriend, and your career shouldn't be compromised in any sense because of her choice.   \n\n\nShe has everything she needs in the house. I think your wife is just taking her side because it's easier for her as she's not the one who has to give something up.   \n\n\nYour daughter has a room, she has space and she has privacy. That should be enough for her when you're the one doing her a favour.

If she needs more space or privacy she needs to  put her big girl panties on and find a new place to live.  I don't understand the why some adults feel their arents are supposed to accommodate them like they did when they were children who were dependent on them.

It needs to stay an office because like she said, it's more private. With another adult in your home you need that privacy for the sake of your clients. \n\nI'm sorry your wife betrayed you like this. You need to have a frank conversation with her and separately with your daughter that your child is free to make her own choices but making adult choices, being an adult, comes with adult consequences.  Her not getting her childhood bedroom back is a minor consequence. If she can't deal with that then she needs to get out of your house and learn some adult responsibility. (But kicking her out is not the goal). \n\nTeaching her that lesson is far more compassionate than caving to what is not a reasonable request for you to uproot your office.

She moved out years ago, and now has moved back. You've changed your house layout to better revolve around what you need (Which is now a separate home office).

Stand your ground.", "NTA you just took over an unused room, now that she wants to go back she can do the same and use the guest room.\n\nI don't know for how long your daughter wants to stay, but if you went through with what they want, you would probably have to move your things once she leaves again. Given that you don't have an abundance of rooms, you can't keep one of them to be your daughters forever.", "Definitely NTA!!! \n\nShe made her decision to move out and should be grateful for being accepted back. \n\nMoving out is a big decision, and of course shit happens in life and sometimes you need to give a step back, but she can't expect to go back in time.\n\nDON'T GIVE UP ON YOUR OFFICE!
