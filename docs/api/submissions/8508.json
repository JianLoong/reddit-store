With another adult in your home you need that privacy for the sake of your clients. \n\nI'm sorry your wife betrayed you like this. You need to have a frank conversation with her and separately with your daughter that your child is free to make her own choices but making adult choices, being an adult, comes with adult consequences.  Her not getting her childhood bedroom back is a minor consequence. If she can't deal with that then she needs to get out of your house and learn some adult responsibility.

Stand your ground.", "NTA you just took over an unused room, now that she wants to go back she can do the same and use the guest room.\n\nI don't know for how long your daughter wants to stay, but if you went through with what they want, you would probably have to move your things once she leaves again. Given that you don't have an abundance of rooms, you can't keep one of them to be your daughters forever.", "Definitely NTA!!! \n\nShe made her decision to move out and should be grateful for being accepted back. \n\nMoving out is a big decision, and of course shit happens in life and sometimes you need to give a step back, but she can't expect to go back in time.\n\nDON'T GIVE UP ON YOUR OFFICE!

I think it's a craft room now.", "That was my first thought. I had to move back in with my parents for a few months and I asked. Also I didn\u2019t get my old room back because mine was my moms new work out room. I got my brothers old room that was also half my moms craft room lol", "When I left my parents' house at 18 for uni my Mom made it clear that I'd always be welcome as a guest, but that I could never return to live there.

I don\u2019t see why an adult child whom you\u2019re allowing to stay with you should have *less* relationship and sexual freedom in the house than they did when they were staying with you as a teenager. If you said you\u2019d never allowed it, fine, but to be fine with it earlier and not now seems bizarre to me.\n\nI\u2019m not saying you\u2019re not allowed to take this position, just that it seems logically inconsistent and weird.", "Choosy beggar", "Well\u2026 sort-of an option but not a good one, the op mentions he chose that room because it\u2019s quiet and private so he could talk to clients without interruption, not for it\u2019s size.  They both want a more private space and the OP appears (assuming) that they need it in order to make their job work, which (again assuming) is paying for a large portion (if not all) of the home/utilities.", "But now op has to! She didn't just say it, she declared it!!", "She's a \"postcard???\"", "My first visit home from uni was fine. My second visit, my dad made my mom a big art desk to fit over my bed, but they moved the desk out (but there were still paints everywhere). My third visit my stuff was still in the room, but as it was a pain to move the desk, I slept in the guest room. My fourth- my stuff was boxed or in the guest room. My parents have always said \"we love it when you come home. And then we love it when you go away again\" lol.  That being said I've always felt welcomed there and I got more of a laugh out of it than anything else (I'm the youngest so my parents finally got a nice quiet house when I left- which they totally deserved!)", "Ok but you are clearly making it all about you too....", "When I left at 17 to go to Uni, my Stepmother chucked all my things away. Letters from my deceased great-grandparents, books, artwork, clothes, photos. She wiped my life before 17 clean\u2026 I forgave her then, but when she did it again at the death of my father, I simply cut her out. I try to embrace minimalism now and the first thing I minimalized was her. \ud83d\ude02", "My first uni break, my mom allowed my sister to take apart my bed and move all my stuff to the attic so she have the full bedroom.

I paid to stay with the international students over term breaks rather than ever put myself in that situation ever again", "I see nothing wrong with that, it may be your bedroom but it's your parents house.

These are the things where they pull the plug on life support in the future", "by YOUR desk you mean the one YOU paid for or that YOUR parents paid for?", "My dad has been trying to get me to move back pretty much since the day I moved out to go to college. I'm in my mid-30s, married, have a doctorate, and lived in a different country for a decade. He still hopes I'll come back one day. I never would, but I'm not gonna lie there's a lot of security in knowing that I would only end up unhoused by my own choice as long as my dad is alive.", "That's too bad.  Going off to uni isn't leaving home.  What if you'd stayed and gone to uni in your home town?  \n\nThe world isn't the same as when your mother left home.  I will always have a room for my kids and should they ever need to move home they are welcome.\n\nThey are independent people and I know moving home wouldn't be easy for them but if they need to come live with me, my home is open to them.\n\nThe world can be scary if you don't know you have a safe place to land should things fall apart.", "Difference in culture. My parents expected my 34 year old sister to move back home after her divorce. I was young and kind of thought she would. My parents were so shocked and angry when she didn't. I still laugh about that now. But it's their culture. When my aunts would vist him by themselves, he would ask if their husband's had left them.", "Quiting your job so your adult daughter gets to pick between two bedrooms is absolutely absurd.", "It's a whole lot cheaper to live with another person rather than on your own especially if you share a bedroom.   It could be she needs to find a roommate before she can move out on her own.", "Totally with you on that. If it is better for him, then he should keep the office. I'm just saying moving may be an option in so much as it is his daughter and could keep the peace. Working from home is a lot more common nowadays so I would assume (wrongly perhaps) that clients understand if there is some background noise since not everyone may have access to a super quiet space to work. \n\nHonestly this is more of a N A H situation with the exception that the daughter should understand and be happy she has parents that can take her in.", "[removed]", "Maybe a \"return to sender\" meaning?

Everything else stayed in his room. My mom has some clothes in my closet and my sisters closet but again that\u2019s about it. I know from time to time my mom wants to strangle my dad in his sleep due to his snoring so she\u2019ll sleep in my room. My room is the best room in the house and my bed is the most cozy. That\u2019s why everyone goes to it.", "The second to last time I stayed at my parents home, they\u2019d moved my brothers stuff into that room to paint his room three months beforehand. He just hadn\u2019t moved his stuff back. I slept on the couch for a week and a half, getting to sleep at two or three when my dad went to bed and up at six with mom. I wasn\u2019t allowed to touch my brothers stuff and they kept saying \u2018he will move it soon, be patient.\u2019 I moved it the last night so I could get an actual full nights rest before I left and the amount of screaming and yelling\u2026. I was too tired to care. But that\u2019s when I knew, really knew that there was no place for me there. \n\nThe last time I just made up a cot next to the washer and dryer in the unfinished basement. I was desperate. And it had been a year since the last time and my brothers stuff was all where I\u2019d left it - stacked in the room with a narrow path to the bed and the bed clear. I didn\u2019t want to get yelled at for breaking anything so I didn\u2019t go in there.", "My friend transfered to a local college after getting his AA, and ended up staying at a dorm even though he lived locally. His parents boxed his stuff up when he left and he just kinda never went back. \n\nI felt bad for him, so one year for Thanksgiving and Christmas I invited him and a gaggle of international students over to celebrate. It was a fun and interesting time to say the least. But I can assure you they enjoyed the more \"homely\" setting for the holidays.

OP's daughter didn't move into a dorm for a semester of college, she moved into another permanent living situation.", "My parents are the same way. During the gap between college and finding my first job, they kept hounding me to find a job so I could move out (and I was trying hard).

In my case I moved to a large city at the other side of the country. The fact that my Dad and I weren't friends made that choice easy.
