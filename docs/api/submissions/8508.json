With another adult in your home you need that privacy for the sake of your clients. \n\nI'm sorry your wife betrayed you like this. You need to have a frank conversation with her and separately with your daughter that your child is free to make her own choices but making adult choices, being an adult, comes with adult consequences.  Her not getting her childhood bedroom back is a minor consequence. If she can't deal with that then she needs to get out of your house and learn some adult responsibility.

She apparently feels that she doesn\u2019t need to be an adult with adult responsibilities when she doesn\u2019t feel like it or when it gets hard.  She wants to go back to being a child in her own childhood room where her mom and dad take care of her.\n\nYou and your wife have a responsibility to teach her to be a self sufficient, independent adult.  While you should be her port in a storm, she seems to think that she is entitled to be be an adult but let her parents take care of the hard stuff so she doesn\u2019t have to\u2026 that\u2019s a dependent, victim behavior which will make her a mark for abusive men.  You and your wife need to get on the same page.  Your daughter is an adult, and she needs to be working and in a career that allows her to earn enough money to live on her own in the lifestyle that she can afford.  If she wants a better lifestyle, she needs to get a better job.  She isn\u2019t going to find a good partner if she isn\u2019t willing to do the work and deal with the hard time\u2019s appropriately.  Your wife wants to baby her and take care of her.  But she is not a child, she is an adult.  You and your wife need to have adult expectations of her.  You and your wife are not going to be around and in a place to bail her out for the rest of her life.  She needs to learn how to bail herself out of her own troubles, because you won\u2019t always be there for her.  Your job was to raise your child to become a self sufficient, independent adult.\n\nShe can use you as her port in a storm, but that\u2019s what it is, a temporary stay to regroup.  She gets the guest room, because she isn\u2019t permanently moving back.  She needs to work on her plan to move out.  She shouldn\u2019t be moving out to live with someone, she needs to be moving out to build the skills she needs to live on her own.  She needs that self confidence and self esteem boost that happens when you learn you can do this on her own.\n\nYour wife needs a new life purpose, her job of raising your daughter is done.  While your wife may feel good taking care of her daughter, she is doing her daughter a great disservice and robbing her daughter of the self esteem she needs to be an adult.\n\nOnce you and your wife have hashed this out, then You both can sit down with your daughter and explain the rules for living at home as an adult  temporary, she needs to be working on a plan to move out on her own, you and your wife need to be coaching her, your wife needs to let her/require her to do her own laundry, cook her own meals, etc.  do not make it easier for her to stay than to leave\u2026", "NTA My old bedroom is used as an office: guest room at my dads house.
