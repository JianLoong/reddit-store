NTA, but that's not really going to help you much right now. The reality is that the military is a stable (mostly) living wage job with benefits (essentially free housing and medical care). It'll actually be pretty easy for them to get married behind your back and just go, with or without your support. You can't stop then, but you can help them make a plan. Talk to your son about what he plans to do, remember, the boyfriend will spend a lot of time away (for context, depending on the duty station, my spouse probably spends about 2/3 of their time away) so the son needs to figure out something or he'll be miserable. It's really hard to make friends with other military spouses if you don't have kids, and it's actually pretty hard to adopt as a military couple (it'll also be way more expensive than a single-income junior enlisted military couple can afford).\n\nBases tend to be in small towns with limited employment prospects, but they pretty much always have a community college (and there are often scholarships available to the spouses of junior enlisted people, which will help). The BF will have basic then school to learn about whatever job he'll do. Figure out when he goes to basic, what that job is and how long the school lasts. Convince your son to spend at least a semester at community college near you doing general ed credits (I recommend nursing. There's always a hospital near a base, and they're always hiring. It's also a living wage job that your son can do anywhere if they split up). They might not even be able to be together for a semester anyway. If they can't get through 6 months apart while your son starts college (and probably while the boyfriend does basic and school), they can't survive a military marriage", "LMAO, NTA - *No* he isn't ready to be married at 18, but you might as well give him the money anyway so he won't be broke and married.

Maybe what he wants to do does not involve a degree anymore? \n\nTry not to jump to any conclusions, sit and talk with him.

It isn\u2019t like they won\u2019t have any contact for the next few years, but they may not be as close as they would like.
