{"id": 9793, "submission_id": "110iyv2", "title": "AITA for ordering flowers for my dad for Valentine's Day?", "selftext": "My (25F) parents (55M and and 55F) started going through the divorce process several months ago. They weren't getting along for many years, but my mom presented my dad with divorce papers last year and they are still battling some things out. However, my mom began a relationship with someone else very soon (like within a span of 2-3 weeks) after giving the divorce papers, which may mean she was having an affair and seeing this guy well before separating from my dad. My siblings and I have confronted her about it, and she denies having an affair, but the timeline seems really fast and it seems strange that she would already have a boyfriend pretty much instantaneously after an almost 30 year marriage. I genuinely do not know the truth but my dad has been pretty depressed due to this for the better part of last year. He has lost 30 pounds due to not eating and is now at an unhealthy weight, and honestly whenever I talk to him he doesn't seem like the same person. He has been going to a lot of therapy recently and I do notice him getting a little better, but I'm very worried about him because I know he is suffering from depression. I call him about 2x a month to check in on him.\n\nThe last time I called my dad, he mentioned that this February is going to be very hard for him, since it's his first Valentine's Day without my mom, and she's already going to be spending Valentine's with someone else. After we talked, I felt really bad for him and decided to order him flowers to be shipped to him on Valentine's Day. I chose a local flower shop that's close to where he lives, and picked out a classy looking bouquet with blue and white flowers and added a card that just basically said that his family loves him and that I hope he has a good Valentine's Day. I hope that these brighten his day because I know it's been rough for him.\n\nI told my boyfriend (26M) about this yesterday, and showed him a picture of the bouquet I ordered for my dad. However, my boyfriend seemed upset. When I asked him what was wrong, he basically told me that he felt uncomfortable that I was getting another man flowers on Valentine's Day. But like, this \"other man\" is my DAD. I'm really confused by this because I don't think Valentine's Day necessarily just has to be for romantic love, I also usually do a \"Galentine's Day\" with friends a couple days before, and in grade school it used to be pretty common to give out candy and cards to friends. I told my boyfriend this and he says that it's still a weird thing to do, and that my dad probably would be weirded out by the flowers too. Plus, my bf knows that we have dinner plans at a romantic restaurant for Valentine's, and I plan to also get him red roses, so it's not like I'm putting my dad over him or anything, just sending flowers to know I'm thinking of him. Is this weird? AITA?", "created_utc": 1676217505, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/110iyv2/aita_for_ordering_flowers_for_my_dad_for/", "score": 168, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Go ahead with your plans. If any of my family did this for me, it would make my day. Also, valentine's day is, at the end of the day, just another day.

Either that, or he is showing early signs of control and/or abuse. That is a bit extreme, but tread lightly with this dude.", "I don't think there's anything wrong with sending your dad flowers for Valentine's Day, especially considering the tough situation he's in.

You can't be serious that your boyfriend is worried you are \"getting another man flowers\". It's your FATHER. Lose the boyfriend, hang out with your dad on Valentine's Day.", "NTA.

You did nothing wrong here. However, I have to tell you, cut your mom some slack here. After 30 years of marriage, let her live. You don\u2019t know the ins and outs of her marriage to her dad. They were separated. My two cents.", "NTA. It's so considerate of you to check on your dad and give him flowers. It's not a big deal for you, but surely it'll mean a lot for him. Your boyfriend seems insecure, which is odd. Talk with him about it and have a great Valentine's Day!", "NTA at all. It is very sweet and considerate of you to get your dad flowers for Valentines Day. You're right - that day shouldn't just be for celebrating romantic love. It is your way of showing support for your father and hopefully making him feel less lonely.", "Absolutely NTA!!!\nWhat you're  doing is sweet and considerate by showing your dad that although things are tough now, there are still ppl that love him and care about him. So no, don't let your boyfriend tell you that YTA. Bad form on his part to even suggest that. It's normal to show you parent(s) that you love them, either by giving them a hug, a present or flowers on a special day. Nothing awkward about that. Nor does it warrant his weirdly jealous behaviour. \nI'm sure your dad will find it heartwarming that you're thinking about him and that he raised such a sweet and considerate child.", "I don't think it's weird at all to send flowers to your dad. It's a thoughtful gesture, and I'm sure it would make him feel appreciated and loved. Plus, you're still going to give your boyfriend red roses, so there's no need to worry about that either. AITA? Definitely not.", "NTA - His view is weird. Implying your dad is 'the other man' is not appropriate. He lacks insight to understand you are supporting your father during a trying time; this is what healthy family relationships look like. Given the extent of attention you have planned for your boyfriend on the holiday he sounds insecure and perhaps immature.\n\nYou, a caring loving daughter, should send your dad flowers or any gift when you want to. His comments made you question your actions instead of being supportive.  Don't stop reaching out to your dad; he's the only one you will have and they don't stay on the earth forever. Best to you.", "NTA. \n\nHe\u2019s your Dad and you love him and want to make a tough day a bit brighter for him. Your parents were married a long time and this first holiday will sting. This is love in the absolute purest form and anyone who reads subterfuge or find jealousy in their hearts is the actual asshole. Also, I\u2019d point out that level of jealousy and effort to exert control is a red flag and worth keeping an eye on. I\u2019m not going to scream \u201cleave him\u201d because I don\u2019t know enough about your relationship, but, it\u2019s enough to be an eye opening moment. Be vigilant and start to notice where else your bf is trying to isolate you. \n\n\nI will also say I send my daddy (yes, I\u2019m over 40 and call him Daddy, always have, always will) a Valentine\u2019s Day card every year since I could sign my name. He has always given me and my sister each a red heart shaped box of Russel Stover\u2019s chocolates. The kind wrapped in red cellophane you buy in CVS or any other drugstore. It\u2019s my favorite thing and I look forward to it beyond reason. \n\nNeither of our husbands get upset by this; they know it\u2019s between us and him.  \n\nI\u2019m sorry you\u2019re parents are divorcing that\u2019s tough to navigate at any age, but, when you\u2019re older and can connect the dots on the subtext I suspect it\u2019s tougher. \n\nEditing to add: make sure you signed the card with the flowers and maybe call or text your dad more often. Be open about increasing your contact and watch bf\u2019s reaction that will tell you everything you need to know about his intentions.", "NTA\n\nThis bf of yours sounds like a turd who is sexually jealous of your father. Not cool", "Your boyfriend should be your ex-boyfriend. It is absolutely, 100 percent, certified UNHINGED for him to be jealous of your father.
