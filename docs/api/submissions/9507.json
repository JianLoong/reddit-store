Why are you asking Reddit when you should have your daughter seeing a mental health specialist.\n\nI also have to wonder when she likely goes minimal contact as an adult are you planning on playing victim?", "YTA.

She dated her gf for 2 years and you just expect her to get over it in 2 months. That's more for your comfort than it is hers.

If she is not talking to friends or family about it, then there is probably a reason why, doesn't necessarily have to be a good one. Unless it has been years, please let her grieve in her own way. Grief can manifest itself in unconventional ways.", "YTA. I'll be honest, I find this incredibly upsetting. This is a relationship she's going to remember for the rest of her life, it's not something she'll *ever* get over. She's not doing drugs, she's not being promiscuous, she's not cutting, she's doing something that seems to be helping a bit and she's made her own choice.

Get her into therapy, and you should see one too, if only to learn how to better help her.", "YTA. She needs more time to heal and is trying to get closure.

It helps me feel better and makes the pain hurt less. I know she's not there, but talking to her helps me cope with the grief.\n\nYour daughter lost her girlfriend two months ago. She needs to grieve and you're not allowing that.\n\nIf you think your daughter needs help, have her talk to a grief counselor. Don't monitor her habits and take away a source of joy and closure.", ">I told her I understand her pain but this is an incredibly unhealthy coping mechanism\n\nThat screams, \"mommy doesn't fucking care about your sadness kid\".\n\nIf its an unhealthy coping mechanism, then you must recognize she needs help.

Losing the person you love is earth shattering at any age. Get your child some damn help and actually act like her mom", "YTA\n\nIf your daughter is turning to an AI for emotional support that's a big red flag suggesting she doesn't feel like there's a person in her life she can turn to for the same thing. The fact you stripped her of her emotional outlet is not going to help you fill that need, in fact it's gonna further hurt that relationship. Adding to that fact your massive invasion of privacy. It's like you're torpedoing your own relationship.\n\nTherapy is expensive in some places yes, but you are at this point actively part of the problem and therapy may be what saves your relationship with your daughter. Not to mention actually help her for her own sake.", "YTA. Two months. TWO MONTHS and you think she's going to just be able to act like the person she's loved for two years hasn't died and taken her heart with her? She needs a therapist. A grief counselor. Someone who actually cares. You think she's doing this to keep her dead love alive? She's trying to get closure and you just made it worse. Asking her about it was one thing but... \n\n>she should be speaking to her friends and family instead\n\nWho have you buried? A parent? A lover? A child? She should be talking with a mental health professional of some sort.", "She needs to be speaking to a therapist and getting grief counseling. I kinda think YTA here. She\u2019s maybe using the AI to get some closure.", "I will admit it is something straight out of a black mirror episode and that makes it come off as kind of creepy. However if it is genuinely the first time you have noticed your daughter feeling better since the death then I see no reason why she shouldn't be allowed to use that for grief. I don't want to say YTA but no other option really fits. Best thing I'd say is let her grieve her own way but at some point I'm the near future she should definitely get in some form of counseling or therapy", "YTA just for monitoring internet. I would be so ducking embarrassed if my parents saw my internet. First of all the amount of dodgy sounding porn Iv searched for (I frequently search for step sister Porn but only cause Iv found there videos to be high quality not cause I enjoy the story line or whatever). Then also children want to research medical issues that may be embarrassing (mental health, issues with your privates etc) before deciding if it\u2019s actually an issue that needs discussing further. And at the end of the day if they are doing anything illegal they will probably go out of their way to find out about using a vpn and what not. \n\nthis AI girlfriend shit does needs to go but if she actually became attached to it she would have told you in time without you needing to spy on her like some little pervert.", "YTA IT'S ONLY BEEN TWO MONTHS! WTH!! How are you so cruel as to expect her to be moving on already? This is a coping mechanism and it's helping her. It's likely temporary. It doesn't seem like you're appropriate support for your child and other teens aren't able to understand what she's going through. Get her into some counseling. Stop making excuses why you can't.", "YTA for internet monitoring and playing armchair psychologist.  Why not be helpful and suggest counseling?   And how about give the 17 y/o some privacy?  Have an actual conversation if you're concerned. She'll never confide and be honest with someone invading her privacy.", "NAH.\n\nYour daughter's looking for a coping mechanism, and I think we all have in ways, but this ain't it.\n\nShe's running away from the problem, and as sad as the situation is, she needs to let time do its thing. The further she goes into this, the more she'll hide away from what has truly happened. I'm gonna sound like an AH myself saying this, but she needs to go through those emotions and truly process what has happened.\n\nYou're not wrong at all. She may hurt for a while, a long time even, but there are ways to help her cope and deal with this situation, making an AI of her dead GF is not one of those ways and is arguably incredibly dangerous for her, but she's not an AH either.", "NTA I would get her into grief counseling, my brother died and my SIL said it really helped. There may be online support groups for young people who have lost loved ones. The support group my SIL went to were older people, so online might have better luck finding those who are more her age.", "YTA\n\nThis is how your daughter's coping with the death of her girlfriend. Telling your daughter to not make an AI  is an AH thing to say. She's looking better and until she's ready to let the AI go, be happy she's feeling better.", "NAH. Your daughter is grieving and in a lot of pain; she lost someone she loved. Try to get her into therapy so she cope healthily.\n\nEdit: Please be gentle with her and try to have some empathy though.", "NTA, making an AI of your dead partner is scarily mental. She needs therapy.", "NTA\n\nThis sounds like a Black Mirror episode. Where the wife recreates the dead husband through AI, and it all spirals out of control.\n\nAnyways, what your daughter needs is some serious therapy. This is probably her first major loss of a loved one and isn't able to process this in a healthy way. Everyone copes with grief differently, and it just sounds like she needs a bit of guidance.", "NTA for correctly identifying that this is not a healthy coping mechanism. I\u2019m kind of shocked at all the YTAs who see nothing wrong with a grieving 17yo feeding her late girlfriend\u2019s personality into an AI. It\u2019s only going to prolong and complicate the process. She should speak to a therapist or her guidance counselor at school.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You're still her parent so look around your area for a potential human grief counselor who can work on a sliding scale, even online.

From my brief research into the topic psychologists see both sides of this issue, for some people it's therapeutic, but for others it can turn into them getting sucked into this digital world and never moving past their grief. The Y T A comments are too harsh, you have every right to be concerned that this could quickly turn into an unhealthy coping mechanism because there's evidence to suggest that that can occur, however if you're worried about that you need to be getting her professional help, not taking away her one source of comfort. You said you can't afford therapy which is understandable, it would be worth getting her in contact with her school counsellor though, and I've heard in the US that some therapists do a sliding scale cost based on your income which is something else to look into.
