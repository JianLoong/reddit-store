She's been planning her dream wedding since before she was engaged and has a very specific image of what she wants. \n\nWe picked out the bridesmaid dresses in January and they're all the same style but with different shades of the same colour. In late March, I was diagnosed with a condition that I'm going to be receiving treatments for via port until mid June. Due to the port's placement, the neckline of the bridesmaid dress I'm supposed to wear is extremely uncomfortable. When we went in for our final fittings, I requested that the neckline be made a little bit looser to accommodate this. Hannah was pissed off by this request because, in her words, it makes the dress look trashy because all of the other dresses are very fitted and mine would then be a bit bagger on top.\n\nI told her that if she wants me to wear the dress then it will need to be altered to be more comfortable. I was then informed that my dress looking out of place will be something she remembers when thinking of her wedding. She said that I was being selfish for not sticking through mild discomfort for one day to help make her dream wedding a reality. \n\nIt hurt to hear that and, after considering my options, I pulled out of the wedding. I let her know and said that I'll still come to the wedding and wear an approved dress, but, that I'm not willing to place perfect pictures over my own comfort. This has caused a rift in our relationship and an argument among the wedding party. The MOH sent me a message chewing me out for pulling out a month before the wedding and I'm honestly not sure how to feel about the whole situation. On one hand, I feel guilty for not supporting my sister but on the other I am hurt by her placing her wedding over me.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1682265706, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12wg9q7/aita_for_pulling_out_of_my_sisters_wedding_over_a/", "score": 188, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

No one but her will care that your neckline is a tad bit different. \n\nEveryone who\u2019s gotten married\u2026 how many times since have you gone back and looked at your wedding photos? Now how many times have you looked at your bridesmaid dresses and critiqued them? Literally never.", "NTA.\nYou're not altering the dress to spite her, or for looks. You have a medical condition that was unexpected, and this is one little thing you need accommodation for. Honestly, she's the AH for putting looks first and your medical condition second. Her MOH is also an AH for taking upon herself to chew you out.\n\nOut of curiosity, have you shared this with your mom? I'm wondering what's her take in all this.", "NTA\n\nAnd your sister has a bloody nerve to use the word \"selfish\" over this. You're going through an illness serious enough that you had to get a port put in, which is deeply uncomfortable itself, but also usually means some form of chemo or other very unpleasant treatment on a very regular basis (they don't bother putting a semi-permanent port into your vein unless they need access to it all the damn time). As someone who is chronically ill, I can only imagine the discomfort you're going through on a daily basis. The fact that you were willing to be in the wedding at all was lovely and thoughtful, and all you asked for was for your dress to not make you hurt even more than you already do?\n\nI'm going to say it very bluntly: your sister's response to you was childish and hateful, and even at 21 she is much too old not to understand what you're coping with right now. More importantly, if she's old enough to make lifetime vows to someone, she is old enough to understand that a neckline on her bridesmaid's dress is the last thing anyone is going to pay attention to on her wedding day. Shame on her. And shame on her MOH for ganging up on the bride's sick sister over something so petty.\n\nYou are NTA. They were very unkind, and there's no reason to subject yourself to that when you're already going through so much. Not even for your sister's wedding.", "NTA. Your sister cares more about pictures than her sisters medical condition. She wants your port to be hidden because she thinks people will ask you about it on her wedding day.

Aside from a whispered \"Oh, the pregnant girl's dress is prettier than the regular bridesmaids' dresses,\" no one gave a shit.\n\nThe bridesmaids don't have to be identical for the photos to look great, anyway. Is she going to make them all dye their hair the same color and cut it in the same style? Change the height of their heels so they're all the same height? Or should I shut up now so as not to give the bride any more bright ideas?", "Wow! You have a significant health issue, and what comes to her mind is how her wedding photos will come out. Bridezilla alert!

No parents/grandparents or anyone with common sense?", "NTA. Sis & MOH sure are, though. She is acting like a selfish brat... or a bridezilla. She cares more for pictures than your comfort. What would it matter if the dress would then be a bit bagger on top? \n\nIt isn't like you had the port inserted to spite her. You have an actual medical condition that requires the port. Plus, doctors' orders to not wear tight clothing over the port. As you've stated, it would hurt to put pressure on the port site. WTF is her problem??", "NTA, your sister is being incredibly callous and selfish on this one.  Your parents must be horrified.", "Nope. NTA. \n\nSpeaking as a bride getting married in 7 weeks, I do not get this attitude. Yes,  the day is about me and my soon-to-be-husband. And it's about having the people we love there with us, happy and comfortable.

Shame on your sister for putting ANYTHING ahead of that. \n\nWishing you a full and speedy recovery!", "NTA, your sister has difficulty with the reality of life. Nothing is picture perfect and no one should be asked to be physically uncomfortable for a day to please another. \n\nThe MOH I'd ignore, some folk are just entitled and won't understand.", "NTA. It's unfortunate that your sister can't be understanding about this. It's not as if you chose to get this medical condition. My wife went through the same thing you did with the port, and if you're battling the same thing she did, the fact you'd still be willing to stand for your sister speaks volumes.", "Nta. Sounds like she a bridezilla", "NTA. Medical devices are on the list of valid reasons to refuse to wear a certain dress. If it just wasn't your personal taste, it would be better to suck it up for a few hours, but this is about your health and comfort.", "NTA, and this is absurd.  If you had a cane that didn't match the dress, would she demand that you limp all day so that she would not remember that out-of-place cane when thinking of her wedding?\n\nDo your sister and her friends treat you like this often?", "NTA. You are not responsible for a condition that requires a port. Wearing clothing that is uncomfortable with a port is usally a bad idea since discomfort is a soft marker for the port being manipulated by the clothing. Which is not a good thing.\n\nAnd as someone who never planned a dream wedding and absolutely had one: DO NOT PLAN FOR A DREAM WEDDING! You will find yourself only recognizing the flaws and errors and miss a lot of the wonderful stuff.", "Nta. Sounds like she a bridezilla", "NTA\n\nYour reasons for wanting the alteration are perfectly valid. Your sister's focus on having \"the perfect wedding\" and putting that above your health and comfort is disappointing. \n\nYou're nicer than me, I think.

She\u2019s placing aesthetics over her sister\u2019s health. What an entitled brat move. For my wedding, one of my bridesmaids had to pull out because she hurt her back and she couldn\u2019t travel. One got pregnant and had to COMPLETELY change her dress to be able to wear it. Another gained a lot of weight and had to do the same alteration as the pregnant one to fit in her dress. Was that my vision? No. Does it matter now? Also no.  Shit goes wrong with weddings and you just have to deal with it and move on.

NTA.", "Absolutely NTA\n\nIt's so not worth disturbing your port and the pain and discomfort it will cause especially if you guys are starting early and it goes on late.", "NTA\n\nWhen I read posts like these, I wonder if the purpose of having bridesmaids shifted from close relatives and dear friends being there to help and support the bride on her big day to making sure they look the part for photographs, invest a great deal of money to have fun leading up to the event, and play a role in the bride\u2019s fantasy. \n\nIf you have calmly told her that you understand how important breaking with her aesthetic impacts the wedding, you had little or no idea you would be dealing with a port, and that due to your medical condition, you can\u2019t make this perfect picture possible, she should either make an accommodation for you or allow you to bow out. \n\nShe may have only realized after the fact that it would look worse not having you there at all. Unless she has a friend who can fit the dress and fill in, everything will be off. You have to weigh this against your current reality.\n\nOnly you can prioritize your comfort and decide what is \u201cextreme.\u201d If it is significant enough to impact your health (I\u2019m not sure how form fitting these gowns are) you can make the call. If it is a matter of minor discomfort and inconvenience (and knowing the bride is obsessed with appearances) it may be best for you to suck it up.\n\nIf all she is worried about is your port pulling the line in  photos, perhaps you could pin the dress back for those. If she\u2019s the type who would begrudge you for things out of your control (accidents, temporary mobility needs, eyewear issues, etc) that interfere with her vision, you may never hear the end of it, even if she allows more room at the neckline. \n\nPerhaps the time has come for professional bridesmaids who will be the right size, shape, complexion or level of attractiveness to suit any bride\u2019s plan. Ordinary family and friends can be invited to a reception where everyone can congratulate the couple and celebrate without the pressure of ruing the wedding.", "NTA - you didn't pull out of the wedding because of a dress.

It is really quite interesting.  Here are [some fun facts:](https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/57821/21-historical-roles-and-responsibilities-wedding-party)\n\n*  Ancient Roman law required 10 witnesses to be present at a wedding, which is considered a precursor to the bridal party tradition. Bridesmaids and groomsmen had to dress just like the bride and groom to confuse vengeful spirit presences (or real-life jealous suitors) who might try to harm the newlyweds.\n\n* Another origin story for the bridesmaid tradition is Biblical: When Jacob married Leah and Rachel, each brought her own \u201cmaid\u201d\u2014but they were personal servants rather than your typical bouquet-holding bridesmaids.\n\nSo, according to history, the wedding party operates as a smokescreen to confuse vengeful and evil spirits.  Did one of these inhabit your sister and her maid of honor?  Because if so, this is already not boding well for your sister's union to her future husband.  The second tidbit about personal servants is exactly what your sister is channeling here, and I have no idea where she thinks that she can get off at treating you or anyone else just like that.\n\nAt present, the first person to come up to bat for you *should* be your sibling.  Your sister won't tell you this, although don't doubt for a second that the argument amongst the wedding party is that the bride is placing aesthetics *over* your comfort, that makes her a total dick, and she knows it.  \n\nAnd so, if history or superstition is any indication, I really and truly hope that your sister's husband sees the light.  Her actions are totally unacceptable and you should not have to feel like you need to sacrifice your comfort and well-being because your sister decides she's going to act like some harpy. By the way,\n\n> ...Bridesmaids of the past also used to walk down the aisle with aromatic bunches of garlic, herbs, and grains to drive evil spirits away (and to help make things smell nice in times when hygiene was a bit different).\n\nThat last one is for your raging, stinky a-hole sister, not you who is NTA.", "NTA.
