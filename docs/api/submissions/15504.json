She's been planning her dream wedding since before she was engaged and has a very specific image of what she wants. \n\nWe picked out the bridesmaid dresses in January and they're all the same style but with different shades of the same colour. In late March, I was diagnosed with a condition that I'm going to be receiving treatments for via port until mid June. Due to the port's placement, the neckline of the bridesmaid dress I'm supposed to wear is extremely uncomfortable. When we went in for our final fittings, I requested that the neckline be made a little bit looser to accommodate this. Hannah was pissed off by this request because, in her words, it makes the dress look trashy because all of the other dresses are very fitted and mine would then be a bit bagger on top.\n\nI told her that if she wants me to wear the dress then it will need to be altered to be more comfortable. I was then informed that my dress looking out of place will be something she remembers when thinking of her wedding. She said that I was being selfish for not sticking through mild discomfort for one day to help make her dream wedding a reality. \n\nIt hurt to hear that and, after considering my options, I pulled out of the wedding. I let her know and said that I'll still come to the wedding and wear an approved dress, but, that I'm not willing to place perfect pictures over my own comfort. This has caused a rift in our relationship and an argument among the wedding party. The MOH sent me a message chewing me out for pulling out a month before the wedding and I'm honestly not sure how to feel about the whole situation. On one hand, I feel guilty for not supporting my sister but on the other I am hurt by her placing her wedding over me.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1682265706, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12wg9q7/aita_for_pulling_out_of_my_sisters_wedding_over_a/", "score": 685, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

No one but her will care that your neckline is a tad bit different. \n\nEveryone who\u2019s gotten married\u2026 how many times since have you gone back and looked at your wedding photos? Now how many times have you looked at your bridesmaid dresses and critiqued them? Literally never.", "NTA.\nYou're not altering the dress to spite her, or for looks. You have a medical condition that was unexpected, and this is one little thing you need accommodation for. Honestly, she's the AH for putting looks first and your medical condition second. Her MOH is also an AH for taking upon herself to chew you out.\n\nOut of curiosity, have you shared this with your mom? I'm wondering what's her take in all this.", "NTA\n\nAnd your sister has a bloody nerve to use the word \"selfish\" over this. You're going through an illness serious enough that you had to get a port put in, which is deeply uncomfortable itself, but also usually means some form of chemo or other very unpleasant treatment on a very regular basis (they don't bother putting a semi-permanent port into your vein unless they need access to it all the damn time). As someone who is chronically ill, I can only imagine the discomfort you're going through on a daily basis. The fact that you were willing to be in the wedding at all was lovely and thoughtful, and all you asked for was for your dress to not make you hurt even more than you already do?\n\nI'm going to say it very bluntly: your sister's response to you was childish and hateful, and even at 21 she is much too old not to understand what you're coping with right now. More importantly, if she's old enough to make lifetime vows to someone, she is old enough to understand that a neckline on her bridesmaid's dress is the last thing anyone is going to pay attention to on her wedding day. Shame on her. And shame on her MOH for ganging up on the bride's sick sister over something so petty.\n\nYou are NTA. They were very unkind, and there's no reason to subject yourself to that when you're already going through so much. Not even for your sister's wedding.", "NTA. Your sister cares more about pictures than her sisters medical condition. She wants your port to be hidden because she thinks people will ask you about it on her wedding day.

Aside from a whispered \"Oh, the pregnant girl's dress is prettier than the regular bridesmaids' dresses,\" no one gave a shit.\n\nThe bridesmaids don't have to be identical for the photos to look great, anyway. Is she going to make them all dye their hair the same color and cut it in the same style? Change the height of their heels so they're all the same height? Or should I shut up now so as not to give the bride any more bright ideas?", "Wow! You have a significant health issue, and what comes to her mind is how her wedding photos will come out. Bridezilla alert!

No parents/grandparents or anyone with common sense?", "NTA. Sis & MOH sure are, though. She is acting like a selfish brat... or a bridezilla. She cares more for pictures than your comfort. What would it matter if the dress would then be a bit bagger on top? \n\nIt isn't like you had the port inserted to spite her. You have an actual medical condition that requires the port. Plus, doctors' orders to not wear tight clothing over the port. As you've stated, it would hurt to put pressure on the port site. WTF is her problem??", "NTA, your sister is being incredibly callous and selfish on this one.  Your parents must be horrified.", "Nope. NTA. \n\nSpeaking as a bride getting married in 7 weeks, I do not get this attitude. Yes,  the day is about me and my soon-to-be-husband. And it's about having the people we love there with us, happy and comfortable.

Shame on your sister for putting ANYTHING ahead of that. \n\nWishing you a full and speedy recovery!", "NTA, your sister has difficulty with the reality of life. Nothing is picture perfect and no one should be asked to be physically uncomfortable for a day to please another. \n\nThe MOH I'd ignore, some folk are just entitled and won't understand.", "NTA. It's unfortunate that your sister can't be understanding about this. It's not as if you chose to get this medical condition. My wife went through the same thing you did with the port, and if you're battling the same thing she did, the fact you'd still be willing to stand for your sister speaks volumes.", "Nta. Sounds like she a bridezilla", "NTA. Medical devices are on the list of valid reasons to refuse to wear a certain dress. If it just wasn't your personal taste, it would be better to suck it up for a few hours, but this is about your health and comfort.", "NTA, and this is absurd.  If you had a cane that didn't match the dress, would she demand that you limp all day so that she would not remember that out-of-place cane when thinking of her wedding?\n\nDo your sister and her friends treat you like this often?", "NTA. You are not responsible for a condition that requires a port. Wearing clothing that is uncomfortable with a port is usally a bad idea since discomfort is a soft marker for the port being manipulated by the clothing. Which is not a good thing.\n\nAnd as someone who never planned a dream wedding and absolutely had one: DO NOT PLAN FOR A DREAM WEDDING! You will find yourself only recognizing the flaws and errors and miss a lot of the wonderful stuff.", "Nta. Sounds like she a bridezilla", "NTA\n\nYour reasons for wanting the alteration are perfectly valid. Your sister's focus on having \"the perfect wedding\" and putting that above your health and comfort is disappointing. \n\nYou're nicer than me, I think. I don't think I would be going to the wedding. I'd send a card and a small gift with my regrets.\n\nI'm sorry about your diagnosis. Best wishes for a speedy recovery.", "NTA. You can now enjoy the wedding in comfort.", "This may sound harsh but clearly your sister doesn\u2019t give a shit about you so I\u2019d not feel bad in the slightest.

She\u2019s placing aesthetics over her sister\u2019s health. What an entitled brat move. For my wedding, one of my bridesmaids had to pull out because she hurt her back and she couldn\u2019t travel. One got pregnant and had to COMPLETELY change her dress to be able to wear it. Another gained a lot of weight and had to do the same alteration as the pregnant one to fit in her dress.

NTA.", "Absolutely NTA\n\nIt's so not worth disturbing your port and the pain and discomfort it will cause especially if you guys are starting early and it goes on late.", "NTA\n\nWhen I read posts like these, I wonder if the purpose of having bridesmaids shifted from close relatives and dear friends being there to help and support the bride on her big day to making sure they look the part for photographs, invest a great deal of money to have fun leading up to the event, and play a role in the bride\u2019s fantasy. \n\nIf you have calmly told her that you understand how important breaking with her aesthetic impacts the wedding, you had little or no idea you would be dealing with a port, and that due to your medical condition, you can\u2019t make this perfect picture possible, she should either make an accommodation for you or allow you to bow out. \n\nShe may have only realized after the fact that it would look worse not having you there at all. Unless she has a friend who can fit the dress and fill in, everything will be off. You have to weigh this against your current reality.\n\nOnly you can prioritize your comfort and decide what is \u201cextreme.\u201d If it is significant enough to impact your health (I\u2019m not sure how form fitting these gowns are) you can make the call. If it is a matter of minor discomfort and inconvenience (and knowing the bride is obsessed with appearances) it may be best for you to suck it up.\n\nIf all she is worried about is your port pulling the line in  photos, perhaps you could pin the dress back for those. If she\u2019s the type who would begrudge you for things out of your control (accidents, temporary mobility needs, eyewear issues, etc) that interfere with her vision, you may never hear the end of it, even if she allows more room at the neckline. \n\nPerhaps the time has come for professional bridesmaids who will be the right size, shape, complexion or level of attractiveness to suit any bride\u2019s plan. Ordinary family and friends can be invited to a reception where everyone can congratulate the couple and celebrate without the pressure of ruing the wedding.", "NTA - you didn't pull out of the wedding because of a dress.

It is really quite interesting.  Here are [some fun facts:](https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/57821/21-historical-roles-and-responsibilities-wedding-party)\n\n*  Ancient Roman law required 10 witnesses to be present at a wedding, which is considered a precursor to the bridal party tradition. Bridesmaids and groomsmen had to dress just like the bride and groom to confuse vengeful spirit presences (or real-life jealous suitors) who might try to harm the newlyweds.\n\n* Another origin story for the bridesmaid tradition is Biblical: When Jacob married Leah and Rachel, each brought her own \u201cmaid\u201d\u2014but they were personal servants rather than your typical bouquet-holding bridesmaids.\n\nSo, according to history, the wedding party operates as a smokescreen to confuse vengeful and evil spirits.  Did one of these inhabit your sister and her maid of honor?  Because if so, this is already not boding well for your sister's union to her future husband.  The second tidbit about personal servants is exactly what your sister is channeling here, and I have no idea where she thinks that she can get off at treating you or anyone else just like that.\n\nAt present, the first person to come up to bat for you *should* be your sibling.  Your sister won't tell you this, although don't doubt for a second that the argument amongst the wedding party is that the bride is placing aesthetics *over* your comfort, that makes her a total dick, and she knows it.  \n\nAnd so, if history or superstition is any indication, I really and truly hope that your sister's husband sees the light.  Her actions are totally unacceptable and you should not have to feel like you need to sacrifice your comfort and well-being because your sister decides she's going to act like some harpy. By the way,\n\n> ...Bridesmaids of the past also used to walk down the aisle with aromatic bunches of garlic, herbs, and grains to drive evil spirits away (and to help make things smell nice in times when hygiene was a bit different).\n\nThat last one is for your raging, stinky a-hole sister, not you who is NTA.", "NTA.

Happy to tell the story, though, because I too live for drama, and also will tell any story at the drop of a hat. \ud83d\ude05\n\nThe husband and I originally planned not to have anyone but our parents at the actual ceremony -- which a friend was officiating in park pavilion -- because we're awkward people who felt weird about being watched with all our gross human feelings on display. So my friends had come in the morning/afternoon to help set things up, and then left to go get ready for food and revelry in the evening.\n\nWe ended up with a few more people present during the ceremony -- some folks arrived earlier than planned because they were from out of town, and they were absolutely just gonna sit in their car in the July heat and wait because they're lovely but we absolutely could not do that to them. I absolutely panicked that if my beloved friends found out we'd expanded this ceremony beyond the original scope and I didn't include them after the unending support they'd been leading up to this wedding, that they'd be hurt. So I fired off a quick text to the group chat that said pretty much, _hey, this thing has gotten a little out of hand, if you can make it here in ten minutes you're welcome to come to the ceremony._ One or two people did, we were married, it was lovely.\n\nWhat I didn't realize is that this sudden change of plan for my friend, who was prepping something to bring to the potluck and getting ready, hit her in a specific emotion and made her feel more excluded (because it was an impossible feat on her part to make it on the timeline) than if I'd said nothing. She apparently spent the next 45 minutes getting ready, telling herself she wasn't going to say anything, etc -- but I greeted her boisterously when she arrived and apparently it just slipped out. She cooled off with our friends and I tried to give her some space for a bit (not too hard, as we were doing the wedding rounds) because it was clear I'd hurt her feelings and I felt terribly. \n\nWe talked later and I apologized, like, I see how what happened had the effect it did, and she apologized because she had known that and hadn't meant to snap, but it had accidentally stewed over. We saw each other's POV and empathized and we're all solid now. (It's been several years since the wedding.) But because I've got the good ol' garbage brain (anxiety, lol), every now and then I remember and I'm like _oh noooooooo I'm a monster!_", "I always thought my port scar wasn't that bad until a nurse said something about how wide it is \ud83d\ude29\ud83d\ude06 it's probably because I have EDS though, plus I react to surgical glue so they had to only use stitches for closure.\n\nI'm sorry you require 24/7 access, I know how uncomfortable it can get by the end of the week! I haven't had access to infusions (just saline for POTS) for a while, which isn't at all ideal, but I don't miss trying to bathe around the dressing or finding a comfortable way to sleep. I hope your needles are low profile, at least!", "I\u2019m accessed 4 days a week, skin has to recover for the other 3.  Huge scar because I\u2019ve also got EDS.  It\u2019s constantly sore and itchy.  No way in hell I\u2019m wearing something uncomfortable on top of that!  I\u2019d be so pissed and hurt if I were in OP\u2019s shoes.  Bride should just be thankful OP is healthy enough to be there at all.", "If the MIL does just block her without responding. She\u2019s your sister\u2019s husband\u2019s mother, you have no real connection to her so who cares what she thinks.", "Ooof, if that happens, push back, tell her the bride wanted the pictures to be perfect, hence why you are stepping down.", "If she does that mention so you really bullying someone with a medical problem. My mom had one of those when she was doing chemo.  I'd never think of making her uncomfy when she had to have a surgical item attached to her for her survival.  At this point as the petty person I am I'd mention on social media because that drama can take a issue with health something along the lines of. If you plan on attacking me over not wearing a specific dress over a wedding let it be known your attacking someone who has a surgical item in her for her medical issues she's getting help on.  If you are one of those take a good look in the mirror and see you think someone's pictures are more important than a sick person fighting a illness and take the drama away from me", "The thing about this: no wedding ever goes perfectly. I\u2019ve been a bridesmaid/informal wedding planner and am married myself, and small things always goes wrong. I was a bridesmaid where the groomsman I was assigned to had his car break down and he didn\u2019t show up for ceremony or pictures. My mom forgot to cut her cake. My MOH had one of her bridesmaids wake up with COVID on her wedding day. A friend\u2019s zipper broke on her bridesmaid dress as she was getting out of the car at the church and she had to be pinned and sewn into her dress like 5 minutes before the ceremony. At another friend\u2019s, one of the zippers got stuck and wouldn\u2019t go up or down, leaving her half in/half out of her dress; took 3 of us bridesmaids fiddling with it while quietly cursing and hiding from the bride to finally get it unstuck. At my wedding, the cake tipped over when they were moving it through the venue and the top tiers fell off. And it was annoying, since I made the cake myself and spent forever on it, to only have 1 tier to serve. But you know what? I married the person I love best, and THAT is what matters. Anyone who\u2019s sitting there on their wedding day grumpy about something like pictures going \u201cwrong\u201d is more interested in the wedding than the actual marriage.", "Your sister wants a wedding (aka: party with a white dress) and not a marriage.", "Their insensitivity is appalling. Would they rather have you grimacing in all the photos because you were experiencing extreme discomfort all day?", "that totally makes sense!  thanks for sharing :)", "You're a better person than me.  \"Piss off\" would be the response before blocking her."]}
