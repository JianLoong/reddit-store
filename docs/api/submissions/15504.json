She's been planning her dream wedding since before she was engaged and has a very specific image of what she wants. \n\nWe picked out the bridesmaid dresses in January and they're all the same style but with different shades of the same colour. In late March, I was diagnosed with a condition that I'm going to be receiving treatments for via port until mid June. Due to the port's placement, the neckline of the bridesmaid dress I'm supposed to wear is extremely uncomfortable. When we went in for our final fittings, I requested that the neckline be made a little bit looser to accommodate this. Hannah was pissed off by this request because, in her words, it makes the dress look trashy because all of the other dresses are very fitted and mine would then be a bit bagger on top.\n\nI told her that if she wants me to wear the dress then it will need to be altered to be more comfortable. I was then informed that my dress looking out of place will be something she remembers when thinking of her wedding. She said that I was being selfish for not sticking through mild discomfort for one day to help make her dream wedding a reality. \n\nIt hurt to hear that and, after considering my options, I pulled out of the wedding. I let her know and said that I'll still come to the wedding and wear an approved dress, but, that I'm not willing to place perfect pictures over my own comfort. This has caused a rift in our relationship and an argument among the wedding party. The MOH sent me a message chewing me out for pulling out a month before the wedding and I'm honestly not sure how to feel about the whole situation. On one hand, I feel guilty for not supporting my sister but on the other I am hurt by her placing her wedding over me.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1682265706, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12wg9q7/aita_for_pulling_out_of_my_sisters_wedding_over_a/", "score": 1791, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

No one but her will care that your neckline is a tad bit different. \n\nEveryone who\u2019s gotten married\u2026 how many times since have you gone back and looked at your wedding photos? Now how many times have you looked at your bridesmaid dresses and critiqued them? Literally never.", "NTA.\nYou're not altering the dress to spite her, or for looks. You have a medical condition that was unexpected, and this is one little thing you need accommodation for. Honestly, she's the AH for putting looks first and your medical condition second. Her MOH is also an AH for taking upon herself to chew you out.\n\nOut of curiosity, have you shared this with your mom? I'm wondering what's her take in all this.", "NTA\n\nAnd your sister has a bloody nerve to use the word \"selfish\" over this. You're going through an illness serious enough that you had to get a port put in, which is deeply uncomfortable itself, but also usually means some form of chemo or other very unpleasant treatment on a very regular basis (they don't bother putting a semi-permanent port into your vein unless they need access to it all the damn time). As someone who is chronically ill, I can only imagine the discomfort you're going through on a daily basis. The fact that you were willing to be in the wedding at all was lovely and thoughtful, and all you asked for was for your dress to not make you hurt even more than you already do?\n\nI'm going to say it very bluntly: your sister's response to you was childish and hateful, and even at 21 she is much too old not to understand what you're coping with right now. More importantly, if she's old enough to make lifetime vows to someone, she is old enough to understand that a neckline on her bridesmaid's dress is the last thing anyone is going to pay attention to on her wedding day. Shame on her. And shame on her MOH for ganging up on the bride's sick sister over something so petty.\n\nYou are NTA. They were very unkind, and there's no reason to subject yourself to that when you're already going through so much. Not even for your sister's wedding.", "NTA. Your sister cares more about pictures than her sisters medical condition. She wants your port to be hidden because she thinks people will ask you about it on her wedding day.

Aside from a whispered \"Oh, the pregnant girl's dress is prettier than the regular bridesmaids' dresses,\" no one gave a shit.\n\nThe bridesmaids don't have to be identical for the photos to look great, anyway. Is she going to make them all dye their hair the same color and cut it in the same style? Change the height of their heels so they're all the same height? Or should I shut up now so as not to give the bride any more bright ideas?", "Wow! You have a significant health issue, and what comes to her mind is how her wedding photos will come out. Bridezilla alert!

No parents/grandparents or anyone with common sense?", "NTA. Sis & MOH sure are, though. She is acting like a selfish brat... or a bridezilla. She cares more for pictures than your comfort. What would it matter if the dress would then be a bit bagger on top? \n\nIt isn't like you had the port inserted to spite her. You have an actual medical condition that requires the port. Plus, doctors' orders to not wear tight clothing over the port. As you've stated, it would hurt to put pressure on the port site. WTF is her problem??", "NTA, your sister is being incredibly callous and selfish on this one.  Your parents must be horrified.", "Nope. NTA. \n\nSpeaking as a bride getting married in 7 weeks, I do not get this attitude. Yes,  the day is about me and my soon-to-be-husband. And it's about having the people we love there with us, happy and comfortable.

Shame on your sister for putting ANYTHING ahead of that. \n\nWishing you a full and speedy recovery!", "NTA, your sister has difficulty with the reality of life. Nothing is picture perfect and no one should be asked to be physically uncomfortable for a day to please another. \n\nThe MOH I'd ignore, some folk are just entitled and won't understand.", "NTA. It's unfortunate that your sister can't be understanding about this. It's not as if you chose to get this medical condition. My wife went through the same thing you did with the port, and if you're battling the same thing she did, the fact you'd still be willing to stand for your sister speaks volumes.", "Nta. Sounds like she a bridezilla", "NTA. Medical devices are on the list of valid reasons to refuse to wear a certain dress. If it just wasn't your personal taste, it would be better to suck it up for a few hours, but this is about your health and comfort.", "NTA, and this is absurd.  If you had a cane that didn't match the dress, would she demand that you limp all day so that she would not remember that out-of-place cane when thinking of her wedding?\n\nDo your sister and her friends treat you like this often?", "NTA. You are not responsible for a condition that requires a port. Wearing clothing that is uncomfortable with a port is usally a bad idea since discomfort is a soft marker for the port being manipulated by the clothing. Which is not a good thing.\n\nAnd as someone who never planned a dream wedding and absolutely had one: DO NOT PLAN FOR A DREAM WEDDING! You will find yourself only recognizing the flaws and errors and miss a lot of the wonderful stuff.", "Nta. Sounds like she a bridezilla", "NTA\n\nYour reasons for wanting the alteration are perfectly valid. Your sister's focus on having \"the perfect wedding\" and putting that above your health and comfort is disappointing. \n\nYou're nicer than me, I think. I don't think I would be going to the wedding. I'd send a card and a small gift with my regrets.\n\nI'm sorry about your diagnosis. Best wishes for a speedy recovery.", "NTA. You can now enjoy the wedding in comfort.", "This may sound harsh but clearly your sister doesn\u2019t give a shit about you so I\u2019d not feel bad in the slightest.

She\u2019s placing aesthetics over her sister\u2019s health. What an entitled brat move. For my wedding, one of my bridesmaids had to pull out because she hurt her back and she couldn\u2019t travel. One got pregnant and had to COMPLETELY change her dress to be able to wear it. Another gained a lot of weight and had to do the same alteration as the pregnant one to fit in her dress. Was that my vision? No. Does it matter now? Also no.  Shit goes wrong with weddings and you just have to deal with it and move on.

NTA.", "Absolutely NTA\n\nIt's so not worth disturbing your port and the pain and discomfort it will cause especially if you guys are starting early and it goes on late.", "NTA\n\nWhen I read posts like these, I wonder if the purpose of having bridesmaids shifted from close relatives and dear friends being there to help and support the bride on her big day to making sure they look the part for photographs, invest a great deal of money to have fun leading up to the event, and play a role in the bride\u2019s fantasy. \n\nIf you have calmly told her that you understand how important breaking with her aesthetic impacts the wedding, you had little or no idea you would be dealing with a port, and that due to your medical condition, you can\u2019t make this perfect picture possible, she should either make an accommodation for you or allow you to bow out. \n\nShe may have only realized after the fact that it would look worse not having you there at all. Unless she has a friend who can fit the dress and fill in, everything will be off. You have to weigh this against your current reality.\n\nOnly you can prioritize your comfort and decide what is \u201cextreme.\u201d If it is significant enough to impact your health (I\u2019m not sure how form fitting these gowns are) you can make the call. If it is a matter of minor discomfort and inconvenience (and knowing the bride is obsessed with appearances) it may be best for you to suck it up.\n\nIf all she is worried about is your port pulling the line in  photos, perhaps you could pin the dress back for those. If she\u2019s the type who would begrudge you for things out of your control (accidents, temporary mobility needs, eyewear issues, etc) that interfere with her vision, you may never hear the end of it, even if she allows more room at the neckline. \n\nPerhaps the time has come for professional bridesmaids who will be the right size, shape, complexion or level of attractiveness to suit any bride\u2019s plan. Ordinary family and friends can be invited to a reception where everyone can congratulate the couple and celebrate without the pressure of ruing the wedding.", "NTA - you didn't pull out of the wedding because of a dress.

It is really quite interesting.  Here are [some fun facts:](https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/57821/21-historical-roles-and-responsibilities-wedding-party)\n\n*  Ancient Roman law required 10 witnesses to be present at a wedding, which is considered a precursor to the bridal party tradition. Bridesmaids and groomsmen had to dress just like the bride and groom to confuse vengeful spirit presences (or real-life jealous suitors) who might try to harm the newlyweds.\n\n* Another origin story for the bridesmaid tradition is Biblical: When Jacob married Leah and Rachel, each brought her own \u201cmaid\u201d\u2014but they were personal servants rather than your typical bouquet-holding bridesmaids.\n\nSo, according to history, the wedding party operates as a smokescreen to confuse vengeful and evil spirits.  Did one of these inhabit your sister and her maid of honor?  Because if so, this is already not boding well for your sister's union to her future husband.  The second tidbit about personal servants is exactly what your sister is channeling here, and I have no idea where she thinks that she can get off at treating you or anyone else just like that.\n\nAt present, the first person to come up to bat for you *should* be your sibling.  Your sister won't tell you this, although don't doubt for a second that the argument amongst the wedding party is that the bride is placing aesthetics *over* your comfort, that makes her a total dick, and she knows it.  \n\nAnd so, if history or superstition is any indication, I really and truly hope that your sister's husband sees the light.  Her actions are totally unacceptable and you should not have to feel like you need to sacrifice your comfort and well-being because your sister decides she's going to act like some harpy. By the way,\n\n> ...Bridesmaids of the past also used to walk down the aisle with aromatic bunches of garlic, herbs, and grains to drive evil spirits away (and to help make things smell nice in times when hygiene was a bit different).\n\nThat last one is for your raging, stinky a-hole sister, not you who is NTA.", "NTA.

Might not age as bad as some 80s dresses (truly seems like a uniquely cursed decade for bridesmaid/bridal fashion managing to age gracefully) but unless the dresses are extremely plain they'll look dated before too long. Better to have fun anecdotes about things like my youngest aunt insisting she could only be my mom's bridesmaid if they could have flower crowns like she expected a fight and my mom thinking it was a brilliant idea than picking fights with your loved ones because you don't want to accommodate a medical condition! My mom's bridesmaids dresses are Something Else in the light of decades of fashion marching on, but we still smile about those flower crowns! If you do it right dresses are inherently transitory, but sisters SHOULD be forever.", "Now because of her actions, she will look at her wedding pictures and forever be reminded that her sister isn\u2019t part of them because of her selfishness.", "Married 12 years now. One of our wedding photos we got framed and in the bedroom. I notice it daily but it\u2019s just me and my wife. As for a photo with the wedding party? MAYBE 10 times since we got married, but homestly think its less.", "Honestly, most people do look at their pictures, especially when they're still in love. The whole, being obsessed over an image instead of being compassionate about the person wearing the outfit is a bit much though.", "Seriously. Although it took me looking back at my photos to realize that during the reception one of my bridesmaids had changed into a mini sundress and another had on a tshirt with cut off sleeves and athletic shorts lol.", "I got married 3 years ago, so, pretty recent.\n\nI probably haven't looked at one since July of last year and still haven't even gotten around to framing one in my house", "One of my bridesmaids was a bit too busty for the strapless dress I wanted them to wear. We were able to use some of the fabric from the hem of the dress (she\u2019s also pretty short so it didn\u2019t make the dress too short) to make straps. \n\nI have some anxiety and often wake up in the middle of the night with all of my life regrets replaying in my mind. Those straps are the top of the list of things that keep me up at night. \n\n/s", "u/LowMemory2124  THIS IS THE ANSWER that I hope you read! NTA!\n(Edited username)", "Thanks for the history lesson! (Sounds sarcastic but I\u2019m being sincere.) I\u2019ve never wondered about why there are bridesmaids and groomsmen. Now I\u2019m wondering why I\u2019ve never wondered.", "This comment made me snort happily, like a horse.", "I meant that I will be attending the wedding as a guest and not part of the wedding party.", "I actually offered that to my bridesmaids but they wanted to be matchy matchy, LOL!    I even said they could wear whatever shoes they wanted but of a certain colour schedme and no high heels because it was a wedding on the grass with uneven ground so was concerned that they would turn an ankle.", "Your sister is 21, there is a very high probability that you\u2019ll have a second chance at being her bridesmaid. NTA.", "My brother got married last month and I was in the bridal party. We all live in totally different places and just ordered our dresses from the link my SIL spent. So wedding days come and photographer is there and we all get out dresses on only to realise one of the bridesmaids her dress has come in a different shade. My sister in law just laughed said \u2018love how you promoted yourself to maid of honour\u2019 and we all moved on. When it was talked about at the reception no one had even noticed cause they were looking at my SIL not the bridesmaids. And it will be a funny story well tell about the day for ever now.", "Wait, you had a meal that had gravy at your wedding? I'm a little sad I wasn't invited.", "Haha it\u2019s possible, my wife and I were 18 and 19 and we\u2019ve been married for 23 years so it is possible but a lot of our friends who were married young are now divorced.", "We had an incredible wedding planned. Then 2020 happened. So we planned another one. Then another. Ended up in a full ball gown & cathedral veil at a dive bar. After 10 years together, we just wanted to get married. It didn't matter at all.\n\nThat being said...I am bummed we missed the AMAZING meal we had planned. I still dream about it \ud83e\udd23", "Yup! I told my bridesmaids to get 1940s style dresses in any shade of green. It was most of their aesthetics anyway, so some already had them and the rest could re-wear them.", "Exactly. Could you imagine knowing you\u2019re the reason your sister isn\u2019t in wedding photos? Your *hopefully* only wedding photos of your life? \n\nUnreal.", "That was my first thought as well. Holy macaroni what an awful eye-opener! To find out that someone you thought you knew has it in them to be this heartless and self-centered over a medical issue! Yikes! \n\nOP, absolutely NTA. May you heal well in body and heart.", "Agreed. I'm going to be spitting the phrase \"fucking cheek,\" at every appropriate opportunity.", "Then definitely NTA. If she cares more about \"perfect pictures\" than her sister's well being, I wouldn't be a bridesmaid in your shoes either. And you will still be at the wedding, so the rest of the family should be fine with your decision, too.", "For medical reasons, it is important to keep your port clean and dry. Having a tight fitted dress on, for an entire day,  makes it difficult to achieve both of these things. Your port can clog, if there is severe irritation then there's a chance a chance of infection. Nta but your sister is for not making a tiny concession over anesthetics versus something that quite actually is saving your life. Does she even like or love you because this is the most self centered bs I've ever heard. Good luck with your treatments OP.", "I am reminded of an essay by Robert Fulghum, describing a wedding perfectly orchestrated by The Mother of the Bride, recorded from multiple angles, which went absolutely wonderful up until the bride vomited mightily during her procession up the aisle.\n\nThe couple would happily display the multi-shot video for anniversary parties, with color commentary, and no one laughed as hard as The Mother of the Bride.", "I started dating my husband at 21, got married at 24. We recently had our 15th anniversary.  We've had tough times over the years but 90% of it is from external factors (both of us have messed up families, and both of us have chronic illness.)", "I also really like tracky bums.", "Tell her that if the worst thing about her wedding day is your neckline, that her wedding is going to go wonderfully, and much better than 99% of weddings.", "I've made this comment before because it stuck with me. The pastor for my friend's wedding years ago said at the rehearsal that something will go wrong tomorrow. (Paraphrasing the next part.) But if they want to get married, they'll get married.", "NTA. I do regret my bridesmaids dresses only slightly because despite lots of effort trying to find a dress they all liked and would wear again, I feel\nLike they weren\u2019t perfect (I had five bridemaids who all were varying ages and sizes). But honestly, not accommodating a bridesmaid port? That\u2019s insane! I get you want a lovely wedding, but not accommodating your sisters medical issue is just not ok.", "Please keep us updated if something happens. Sounds like the in-laws might be influencing her just a tiny bit", "My favorite getting ready photo is me, full makeup mid hair getting done and I am SHOVELLING McDonald's fries into my mouth because I suddenly got extremely hungry right before it was time to put the dress on. I had been too nervous to eat all morning but something snapped at that moment. So someone ran out and got McDonald's. And my lovely photographer captured the moment and everyone loves it!", "My favourite is my eldest playing with a car", "I have a huge scar from my port bc I have EDS too! It's a good 2 inches long and 1/2 inch wide, and after 2 years is just starting to fade from deep reddish purple. I have huge sympathy for anyone who has a port or picc line - they're uncomfortable at the best of times, but facing the prospect of a neckline rubbing it all day for a wedding, I would definitely make the same decision to back out.", "I have a framed photo of my 4-year-old niece (flower girl) crying because she didn't want to throw the flowers, while my nephew (ring bearer) looks on annoyedly because he just wants to get down the damn aisle! It's one of my favorite pics from the wedding!", "You lady, I would like to have a beer with", "It's a great word  just remember it's pronounce uh- skanss, not ask- anss, and you're golden.", "That is PRECIOUS \ud83d\udc95 and genius", "I have a great one of my nephew while his dad is putting on my nephew's bow tie. His tongue is sticking out like he's concentrating super hard, and it's hilarious because we have one of his mom making the same face whole she's doing my hair!", "Such a great idea! Will probably get her to both laugh and be sentimental. Such moments are valuable and way better than perfectly staged photos.", "Thank you!\n\nSo pronounce it like \"askew\", which is what I sort of equated it with. As I read it, it kinda felt like it mashed \"askew\" and \"glance\" together (my mind works in mysterious ways), in the same way that you get (for example) celebrity couple names (e.g. Brangelina), or celebrity followings (insert Cumberbitches here). So I guess I was trying to explain that in my mind \"askance\" = askew glance (aka side-eye, looking with distrust)"]}
