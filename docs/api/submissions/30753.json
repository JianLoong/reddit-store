Isolation, no money, compliance and obedience, no marketable skills, no meeting people he doesn't control.   \n\nThis is a set up for her to be a slave, and to be abused.  \n\nNTA.\n\nYou are being a good brother, to not support such a person marrying into your family.", "Why? Do you really think this doesn't happen in arranged marriages?", "This needs more upvotes. This situation sounds like an absolute disaster waiting to happen. Good kind men do NOT make these controlling demands. \n\nFirst you need to make your sister read the following guidance on what the UK law describes as coercive and controlling behaviour.\n\nhttps://www.cps.gov.uk/legal-guidance/controlling-or-coercive-behaviour-intimate-or-family-relationship#:~:text=Section%2076%20Serious%20Crime%20Act,penalty%20of%20five%20years%27%20imprisonment.\n\nMake particular emphasis on the types of behaviours listed that he is already promising to do:\n\nisolating a person from their friends and family\n\neconomic abuse including coerced debt, controlling spending/bank accounts/investments/mortgages/benefit payments\n\ncontrolling the ability to go to school or place of study\nlimiting access to family, friends and finances\n\nAmongst a host of other things. \nOnce she knows that she's willfully entering an abusive relationship she needs to be told point blank that this guy is a lawyer and that if he is found guilty of these crimes against her he stands to lose his entire earnings so he bloody well damned watch himself. Legal professionals are held to a higher standard than the general public and if found guilty he will lose his licence and be barred from legal practice so she should know she holds his balls in her hands if he steps out of line.\n\nYou need to make her aware of numerous helplines that are available for women at risk. She should have access to a bank account that you can put money into. She should also have access to her own passport and legal documents ideally kept with a solicitor or other trusted 3rd party if you have other family in the UK.\n\nShe needs to be told explicitly that a common controlling tactic is that the abuser tells the legally unwise victim that her stay in the UK depends on their marriage. This is untrue and the UK does not deport victims of domestic violence. She will have a legal course to stay if the reason for dissolution of marriage is domestic abuse even if she's not a British citizen so she should never fall for that bullshit. \n\nShe needs to protect herself from social isolation by actively finding herself social circles through local community as soon as she arrives and she should be on a reliable form of contraception that does not depend on repeat prescriptions for the first year or so..I would suggest contraceptive implant rather than pills so he can't withhold it.", "THIS. OP shouldn't tell his sister what she should do. That's the same her parents and future husband do. He should show for her at the wedding, and keep open doors for her no matter what. He should force her only to memorize his phone number. Prepare list of UK charities and patiently wait.", ">Indian right? Stuff like this makes my skin crawl.\n\nI think OP confirmed it on one comment here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17snmgj/aita\\_for\\_refusing\\_to\\_attend\\_my\\_sisters\\_wedding/k8r7n9i/?context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17snmgj/aita_for_refusing_to_attend_my_sisters_wedding/k8r7n9i/?context=3) \n\nThe worst is how many people even on reddit defend this shit practice.", "Do this OP, and give her the name of a women's refuge charity in the UK so she knows somewhere she can call if she needs to. Give her a key to escape if she gets to the point she's ready to. Tell her you'll always be there for her if she needs you.", "Indian here, and no. Most of the time the couple learn to love each other in their own ways and, if not, suck it up for their parents' sake. Note that I'm not saying arranged marriage is a good thing, just that its a thing, and soceital customs often dont allow for love marriages", "Indian here and disagree to a certain extent. Arranged marriages are not forced marriages, both parties get a say. But love marriages are rampant everywhere, at least that's what I've seen from people around me including my grandparents' generation. But yes, in some places (mainly rural), it's more forced than arranged. I've never seen any of that in my life though. But arranged marriages should not be confused with forced ones, which people often do, and love marriages are super common.", "This is a great point and I\u2019m glad to hear it.", "I wasmore speaking from personal experience,but yes, absolutely. My parents didnt choose each other - swayamvaras were for princesses, even when they were a thing - but they learned to adapt. I cant speak on whether they love each other or not, but there is some affection.", "If she decides to leave him in the future at least she will get more support from the authorities in the UK than in India.", "I agree with that part that arranged marriage couples often start to love each other or at least care and like each other enough to grow old together. It was just the love marriage thing I disagree with.\nBut either way, OP is NTA and his family and the sister is making a huge mistake and walking into an open trap.", "I\u2019m not even sure how deceptive it is if this guy is loudly announcing his intentions to cut this woman off from her education and her loved ones after the marriage. He is telling his bride *exactly* what kind of husband he\u2019s going to be - she\u2019s just too na\u00efve to fully understand how miserable this marriage will make her. She thinks the wealthy lifestyle will be enough to make up for everything else he\u2019ll inflict on her.", "I doubt there will even be a wealthy lifestyle for her. For him, sure. For her, I predict a tiny allowance and begging for money for personal needs.", "That or she\u2019ll be given a credit card that he\u2019ll closely monitor for unauthorized spending. \n\nDepends on how he wants her to appear to his own social circle.", "\"You don't need that.\"\n\nwill be commonly said."]}
