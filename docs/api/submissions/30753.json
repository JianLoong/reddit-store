This is an abusive situation. Is there a way to report this to an authority?", "NTA. Future husband sounds like an absolute narcissist. It\u2019s very concerning when you have to ask permission to call anyone let alone family. I\u2019m also guessing he will hold onto her passport so that she has zero freedom.  It sounds more like trafficking than a marriage.  I hope she will be safe.  Your protest is warranted.  She IS in danger.", "NTA for not attending the wedding but a slight YTA if you keep your word on \"They can enjoy the results of the wedding themselves\". One of a major abuse tactic is to isolate the victim from their friends and families. (Hence probably why the husband wont let her call her family without his permission as there are no justifiable reason to impose that rule)\n\nYou cant stop the wedding. But you can tell your sister that you'll always be there in the case of an emergency. (E.g: In the event something happens, and she manages to contact someone for help without her husband knowing).\n\nI'm thinking worst case scenario here where the husband does end up being abusive and the parents wont help.

However, your decision not to attend the wedding may be seen as a strong statement.\r  \n\r  \nIn such situations, it can be challenging to strike the right balance between expressing your concerns and supporting your sister's choices. It might be more effective to continue expressing your concerns, but also make an effort to maintain communication and support for your sister. Alienating yourself from the wedding might make it more difficult for her to reach out to you if she faces challenges in the future.\r  \n\r  \nConsider having an open and honest conversation with your sister about your worries, emphasizing that your intention is to look out for her well-being. Ultimately, it's crucial to approach the situation with empathy and understanding, recognizing that she may have her reasons for going through with the marriage.", "You are not the asshole. However, you should talk to your sister and find out if she wants you to attend the wedding. If she wants you to attend, you should go. Think about it. You are only making the decision not to go because you care a lot about your sister and you want to support her. But the best way to support her is actually just to do what she asks of you. It\u2019s OK to make your opinion clear to your sister and to your parents. But, you need to be aware that if she is with a controlling man, he will probably make her choose between you and her husband. And if she feels forced to choose her husband, you will lose your relationship with her. Sometimes it is better to have to compromise in order to keep the relationship, so that she can rely on you for support in the future. It would be really sad if she lost her brother and got stuck in a horrible marriage at the same time. If she wants to leave one day, it will be easier for her to leave if you are still in her life. You should stick around for her.", "Go.\nNot for you.

It's too late now to convince anyone it's a bad idea, but your behaviour will reflect on her. So absolute best behaviour unless you manage to get her alone.", "NTA \n\nHave you spoken to your sister about your worries ? \n\nIn the U.K. she will absolutely have rights.

I feel like I'm back in Sicily 100 years ago.", "At the moment your sister said she had no problems with it.  Whilst it's easy to foresee unhappiness in the future with this arrangement,  your sister hasn't enough life experience to do so.\n\nTherefore,  if you really want to support your sister,  it would make more sense to attend the wedding.  It shows her support,  gives you time to watch how he treats her, and if they go straight to honeymoon it'll be making use of those last hours.\n\nMake sure she can contact you easily from overseas by perhaps gifting her something (quietly,  for herself to know about) so she can contact you without husband knowing. \n\nIf you don't go, YTA, because it no longer is you trying to help your sister,  but you having a tantrum that noone will notice or care about.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
