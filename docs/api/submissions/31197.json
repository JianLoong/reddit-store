My parents are usually the ones to look after her and take her to her lessons and school etc. because I\u2019m out of country for most of the year for university. Anyways, this was the first time I\u2019d taken her to her swim lesson and I spent most of the lesson by the poolside watching her. It was only near the end of the lesson, with roughly 5 minutes left, where I needed to step away from the pool to collect the payment necessary for the lesson, which I\u2019d left in the car in the rush to get my sister and her things to the lesson on time. Before I left, I approached the swim coach and let him know that I was going to step away for a bit to get the payment and that it shouldn\u2019t take more than 5 minutes to get to my car and back. After asking that he keep an eye on her until I get back, to which he replied \u201cSure, we\u2019ll be right here\u201d, I quickly ran off to my car. On my way back from my car, roughly 3 minutes after I left, I found my sister in the middle of the road in the parking lot looking around frantically and crying with a line up of cars stopped just in front of her. I quickly ran up to her and picked her up and brought her out of the road before the people in the cars began shouting at me for being irresponsible and leaving her unattended. After apologizing profusely to the drivers, I stormed back to the poolside to find the coach talking to what appeared to be a mother and her son (probably 6 years old) who was the coach\u2019s next client (which I found out after confronting him). I then (regrettably) proceeded to shout at the coach and ask \u2018what the fuck he was thinking\u2019 leaving my sister unattended, so much so that she walked into a busy parking lot even after I\u2019d asked that he keep an eye on her. My shouting caught the attention of the other pool-goers and eventually club staff arrived and asked me to leave. Before I turned around to leave with my sister, the coach called out to me asking for the payment for the lesson. I glared at him and took out the cash before tossing it on a nearby table and walking out. \n\nI know I was angry in the moment, but after I calmed down, I started having doubts about whether my response was justified and if in reality I was the one at fault.

You said you told him, but no mention of him responding or identifying the child in question.  It also sounds like he was mid-conversation.  While I agree that staff should be responsible for kids during lessons, you did say lesson was over.  This answer could be the difference between N  T  A  and E  S  H.", "NTA. You're paying what I would assume based on experience at exclusive clubs is quite a large sum of money for ONE ON ONE LESSONS in swimming. What exactly are you paying for if YOU spent the entirety of the lesson supervising her while the coach still had time left in the lesson that he was supposed to be instructing. Also, why exactly is the coach leaving a child unattended by a POOL never mind for long enough to end up in the middle of the road? You could actually sue for negligence, never mind having to pay for a 1 on 1 lesson that resulted in your sister walking into the middle of a road unsupervised!", "NTA OP.  He left your baby sister alone, so much so that she ran into the street looking for you.  I wouldn\u2019t have given him the time of day, much less his payment for the lesson.

Even in a group setting this would be grounds for a major enquiry. Having brought my 3 children through lessons to a high standard I can\u2019t imagine or remotely understand the situation being described. Why would you even have to mention you were going out to the car? Are you required to be there supervising? Why would they be asked to keep an eye on her? The only scenario that seems to make remotely any sense is if the lesson was over. If that\u2019s the case YTA but either way you or the coach would be utterly irresponsible and asking in AITA is trivially downplaying the seriousness of the situation.", "NTA \n\nShe could have drowned while he was not watching. Nope. You don't take any chances with life and death.", "NTA. The coach and the club owe you an apology. Your reaction was equal to the offense.

She couldn't see her sister and panicked.", "A lot of places have the pools right by roads and parking lots for logistical purposes. It's not impossible that this happened.", "The way the pool is set up is that just outside the pool area, is a parking lot with a high traffic of vehicles. So when I said street, it was technically in the parking lot but on a road that had enough cars to cause a line up when my sister was stood in the middle of it. idk if that makes it better or worse as drivers are usually focused on looking for a parking space rather than directly in front of them on a normal street. And a 5 year old child is pretty short compared to the hood of a car", "Kids are actually really fast you blink and they\u2019re doing stuff they\u2019re not supposed to", "Yeah, that seemed off to me, too. Out of the pool, out of the enclosure or pool room, through reception or the entry where people pay, out of the building or center, through the parking lot and into the middle of the street in three minutes? Not buying that. Too many very separate areas, most of which have choke points, in too little time.", "Yeah, this doesn\u2019t ring true to me either.", "Have you been around kids. They can do that in seconds.", "Yes, he said \u201cSure, we\u2019ll be right here.\u201d", "It sounds like those 5 min were still paid for minutes.", "Info to clarify, there was 5 minutes left for my sisters 1 on 1 lesson, and after approaching the coach and letting him know I\u2019d be back within 5 minutes with the payment, he replied, \u201cSure, we\u2019ll be right here.\u201d", "From what I could gather when I went to confront the coach, the mother and child that he was talking to when I came back were likely his next clients who had showed up early. (Early by 5 or so minutes mind you so not drastically early.) But from the time that I took to get to my car and to finding my sister in the road, there should have been 1 or 2 minutes left in her lesson. So, I believe he ended the lesson with my sister a few minutes or so earlier than the actual allotted time and then shifted his focus on the newly arrived student, despite saying that he would keep an eye on my sister while I left to get the payment.", "OP says below that he responded \"Yes, we'll be right here.\" IMHO though it doesn't matter because OP also stated that he left while there was still lesson time on the clock so if this coach was being paid for a 1 on 1 swimming lesson that was still happening, then he is responsible.", "Yes, coach replied with \u201cSure, we\u2019ll be right here.\u201d", "From what I\u2019ve been told by my parents, after dropping the kids off for the lesson, whether that be a group lesson or 1 on 1, the parents (mine included) sit by a nearby cafe/food area which is adjacent to the pools, so not in a direct line of sight of the pool where my sister was in, but within 10-15 meters away. From what limited info I have, this is usually the norm, but there are some parents that drop off their children (some of which are like 10-12 years old) and go play golf. It was my choice (being anxious about caring for a child as young as her with the little experience that I have in babysitting) to sit next to the pool for the duration of her lesson to keep an eye on her.", "Really? He was being paid for a ONE ON ONE lesson that still had time left on the clock when the OP left. Why was he not... instructing that lesson that he was being paid for? Also, for lessons like these, the instructors are legally responsible for their charges regardless of whether parents remain at lessons as well, so no. Your take is entirely wrong.", "WTF It is still not ok to let a child walk off into the street! Common decency!", "The lesson was still on going. When the lesson is going on, it\u2019s his job to watch the child. Also he agreed to watch the child making it his responsibility to watch her.", "NTA and this is a terrible take imo. It's perfectly reasonable to ask the swim coach to keep an eye on her briefly whilst OP went to get the money. What you're suggesting is a counsel of despair, are we never to trust anyone else to behave in a responsible manner? Is OP expected to hang around at school in case the school staff have a temporary lapse of judgement?", "Understood, thanks for the advice. You\u2019re right that I should\u2019ve been more organised.", "A 5 year old child who the swim instructor was legally responsible for, had acknowledged verbally he was solely responsible for in that moment as OP said he was leaving, was being paid to watch exclusively (1-on-1 lesson with time still on the clock) was left unattended for so long that she WANDERED INTO TRAFFIC. If you ask me, his response was a LOT more gentle than mine would have been. I would have involved lawyers.", "He nearly got a child killed with his negligence, her reaction wasn't over the top", "It's common to refer to the youngest in the family as the 'baby', no matter how old they are.", "Sorry, it\u2019s a turn of phrase.

The post is about a one on one lesson with a teacher.", "Just for clarification, I didn\u2019t throw the money directly at him. I threw it down on a nearby table instead of handing it to him before walking away with my sister. But yes, you\u2019re right, I did cause a scene in the midst of my whirlwind of emotions. I likely could have handled the situation more calmly, but in the moment, I just reacted.", "An ass that almost got his sister killed. Coach should be worried for his job.", "Amending my answer. NTA. For a one on one private lesson, it is reasonable to expect the child does not drown & is not kidnapped during the allotted time. Lifeguard should have been watching her & known where she was every moment.", "Thank you. A parking lot makes sense. Street was confusing me.", "Absolutely agree. The story just makes no sense. A private one on one lesson, in a pool. Pools have fencing & gates etc. And this kid did a runner? Sure if all that\u2019s true, lifeguard swimming coach is the asshole. There\u2019s not even a question. Thus I\u2019m full circle back to this story not making a lot of sense.", "Right? Like I know it\u2019s not the point of the story, but since it makes so little sense I\u2019m questioning the story. I know every pool is set up differently but at the bare minimum, water, climbing out, dripping wet & barefoot, past the gate & into the street which we can assume is a mere 5 feet from the pool.", "Yeah, sorry. I wasn\u2019t clear with what I was describing. When I said street, I meant a street in the parking lot.", "Lol clearly you've never had or watched a small child before. Also, not all places are set up the same. A lot of places have a gated way out of a pool that leads directly into a parking lot as a bypass to the pool house.", "Ah, okay. Frankly, I would not have reacted as much as you did.\n\nI would have reacted much more strongly. Maybe dropping an F bomb in front of children wasn't your finest moment but damn, if I were you, I'd be setting out to ruin that guy's career, and if that feels too extreme, remember that his negligence almost killed your sister and someone like that should NOT be in charge of childrens' safety. Because if you don't wanna do it as revenge, do it to protect the next child he fails to properly watch. NTA.", "What had the coach got to say for himself? You haven\u2019t addressed my other questions? Did he think you were taking the child and just thought you were letting him know you weren\u2019t leaving without paying? Still makes no sense. What did your parents have to say?", "Then NTA. \n\nMost children\u2019s programs it\u2019s a split of parents who stay or leave. Once the child is changed and ready to go, you hand them over and they are the responsibility of the staff who run the program. You sign consent and waiver forms, none of which absolve them from losing your child. Just potential risks that can occur while in the facility. \n\nAnybody seeing a child, let alone their child or sibling, randomly on a road would freak out (understandably).\n\nIf you go back, or when your parents do, they should report the incident. The coach doesn\u2019t need a heads up you\u2019re not going to be there, they\u2019re responsible for the child. It\u2019s like dropping them off at day camp, it\u2019s the facilities responsibility hence the reason they\u2019re getting compensated", "I don't care. And you're wrong.\n\nSee what I did there?", "Not my kid not my problem. The issue here is people treating teachers and other professionals as babysitters.\n\nThey aren't. If that kid would have died it would have been OP's fault.", "Sure doesn't sound like it. If they're swimming whats she doing in the road?", "But it wasn't a reasonable request from the point of view that the swim coach could have had to deal with an emergency, thus taking his/her eye of OP's sister. I stand by what I say, OP should have organised himself, not be so reliant on someone else who has to pay attention to other children, especially when they are in the pool. This was a poor judgment on OP's part.", "OP, I really would ignore that advice. It's absurd and takes no account of human fallibility.", "I 100% understand where you\u2019re coming from, and I agree anger here, in general, is totally justified. My response would absolutely also involve lawyers, so we\u2019re on the same page with that.\n\nThat said, kids are absolutely capable of remembering these reactions. His sister was with him when he was shouting swears and getting kicked out. This was already a scary situation for her, I can\u2019t imagine that made it any better. I think it\u2019s important in these situations to take a step back and remember who the actual victim is before deciding how to handle it.", "Yup, my former housemate's nickname was 'Baby' because she was the opps baby of the family. Since in her native language the nicknames of her older brother and sister were the position in the family and there was the eldest (can be used for either male or female) and younger sibling (again either male or female) and changing nicknames all of a sudden would be confusing, the family went with 'Baby'. I was weird in the beginning to call an 18yo friend Baby but everyone got used to it.", "I have an aunt who is still called Aunt Baby Sister. That's how many times our dad told us she is the baby of his family.", "Not all pools habe fences and gates. The one my younger sister goes to for her kids lessons is just a normal public swimming pool with a section roped off when there are lessons. And my youngest nephew is a runner so my sister and BIL will always keep an eye on him when he's playing or physically hold him when in public. In fact that's one of the reasons both of them go to his swimming lessons.", "And the kid would have had to have taken off the second OP left - meaning the coach didn't even start paying attention.\n\nThe other thing for me was that the style of writing was, well, not consistent with finding your 5 year old sister facing off several cars driving around the parking lot. It was too fiction-y. Maybe they just ran their own words through ChatGPT for a cleanup, but... I'm suspicious. Not convinced, just suspicious.", "I was thinking about swim and my kids. Kids who weren't in first grade had to be accompanied during the lesson by a parent or adult guardian. Every place had different setups and different expectations.\n\nIt wouldn't' even have occurred to me to ask someone to keep an eye on my kid because I was familiar with *their* setup.\n\nThat coach should never have agreed and then failed so dramatically.\n\nBut, heck yeah - I certainly know how quickly a little kid can get away from you and hell its dangerous just because there's a freaking swimming pool in the room.", "You couldn't be more wrong about my experience with kids. \n\nYou have a point about the variation in facilities, of course. And a kid could make a beeline out of a place without gates and be in the parking lot in 3 minutes. But even the smallest pools have at least one fairly tightly controlled access point between the water and the public area, by law.  A determined kid could get out alone eventually, probably, a certain percentage of the time. \n\nI'm just not buying the timelines. And that the kid was in the middle of the road. Standing at the front entrance, possibly, after 5+ minutes.", "Okay, regarding your questions\n\n1) Why would you even have to mention you were going out to the car?\n\n1A) I only mentioned it to him at the time because I believed it was the responsible thing to do. Even if the other parents who drop their kids off for these swim lessons take a step away from the pool to sit in the nearby cafe, I\u2019m still inexperienced when it comes to babysitting. Thus, I spent most of the lesson watching by the poolside to appease my anxiousness of being responsible for her. Me mentioning to the coach that I was stepping away and getting his confirmation that he was watching her was just to give myself extra confidence that I could step away briefly like the other parents and guardians do for their children.\n\n2) Are you required to be supervising?\n\n2a) I mentioned this in the answer above, but most parents drop off their children and sit at a nearby cafe/food area adjacent to the pool during their children\u2019s lessons. The reason I sat by the poolside the entire lesson was just to appease my anxiousness of not having her out of my sight due to lack of experience in babysitting.\n\n3) What did the coach have to say for himself?\n\n3a) He was generally unapologetic, saying that due to his next client arriving, he was now in charge of a new child that he had to look after. However, I confronted him saying that my sisters lesson was still ongoing and that his next client (who were the mother and child standing next to him that I mentioned before) hadn\u2019t even entered the water yet and had yet to begin their lesson due to them being early. By this point, the staff of the club had arrived and asked me to leave the premises.\n\nDoes that answer your questions?", "Except that the coach was specifically being paid for a 1 on 1 lesson. Given that his sole responsibility in that moment was the individual lesson AND that as op says coach responded to his saying he\u2019d be back before the 5 was up verbally with a \u201csure we will be right here\u201d it is perfectly reasonable to expect that the coach is not responsible for other areas happening and his only concern is the one student he is being paid to attend to individually for the lesson.", "Yeah, in all honesty, I agree that I likely should have confronted the coach away from my sister, maybe getting her set up in her car seat or something, but at the same time, after seeing her alone, I didn\u2019t want her out of my sight for another second, especially not leaving her in the car alone after she seemed so desperate to find me. So, in that case, I likely wouldn\u2019t have been able to confront the coach in the same manner. But I was a whirlwind of emotions at the time so I acted without thinking.", "Fair point about scaring little ears.", "Sorry if my writing style seems \u201cfiction-y\u201d, I\u2019m a writer and editor of fictional stories by trade \ud83d\ude05 But when writing this post, I just wanted to get the information typed out concisely and abide by the guidelines that r/amitheasshole states for those making posts here.", "There isn\u2019t any supervision for entering and exiting the pool grounds. There are only the coaches and lifeguards around the pool itself. The area to enter the pool area is through the cafe/food area that I\u2019ve mentioned in previous replies. The same cafe area is also where the changing rooms are for pool-goers which is made free to access to all club members for the golf club. The only staff in this area are the people taking food orders and they aren\u2019t responsible for anyone who enters or exits the cafe area directly into the parking lot. After all, many parents tend to drive by the pick up area which is directly outside the entrance of the cafe, where kids tend to come and go freely to get picked up. When my sister left through that entrance/exit, they either didn\u2019t notice her, or assumed that she was being picked up directly at the pick up/drop off area.\n\nEdit: Also, this took place in Malaysia. I\u2019m not sure what the laws are regarding strict supervision of those entering the cafe area which leads to the pools, but it likely isn\u2019t as strictly enforced compared to where you live.", "And your parents? They will need to address it with him and management. Can\u2019t imagine them continuing there. Sounds like if anything happened he and the club would have been liable, don\u2019t understand why they are not taking it seriously and having a serious root cause analysis and corrective action. As you have now learned and sensed by your anxiousness and by asking of the coach to keep an eye, near end of activities is where you need to be extra vigilant. My advice also would have been to tell your sister you were stepping away for 5 mins and to stay with coach until you return.", "1:1, being paid or not, never ever rely on others when it comes to the safety and wellbeing of children. OP's sister clearly felt anxious/insecure, not safe, so searched for him. OP placed put his sister in an unsafe situation from the onset through his own naivity, which he has realised and will learn from it.", "You couldn\u2019t have left her in the car anyway. Kids die unsupervised in cars.", "Don\u2019t get me wrong, you\u2019re definitely much less of the AH than him! From the start I found what you did forgivable, especially if it\u2019s a one-off incident.\n\nThere\u2019s also the possibility you completely made it up to her after, or are in the process of doing so. This wasn\u2019t included, which lead to me judging the situation as I did.", "That'll explain it! Your writing ability is at a totally different level than standard Reddit.", "Okay, yeah, Malaysia sounds very different to any of the several countries I've been to pools in. Given that, I'll withdraw my logistical objection.", "Right, so this happened roughly around 5 hours ago as of writing this reply, and my parents are currently out of country. I contacted them as soon as I got home, about an hour after the incident, and they\u2019re already in contact with the club about this. I\u2019m not entirely sure what actions are being taken as they told me to let them deal with it and just to continue looking after my sister (who is currently taking a nap after having her lunch).", ">never ever rely on others when it comes to the safety and wellbeing of children\n\nDoes this also apply to kids at school, daycare, hospitals etc?", "Just for a little extra info since you mentioned making it up to her, we stopped by Baskin-Robbins after the fact where she proceeded to absolutely devour two scoops of her favourite rainbow (or rather Unicorn in her words) flavoured ice cream.", "Ah OK. Don\u2019t beat yourself up. Could have happened to one of your parents too. She is OK that\u2019s the bottom line. It\u2019s hard minding someone else\u2019s child or in this case a sister you haven\u2019t had the chance to spend time with. You don\u2019t know what they have been taught or not taught about traffic etc. etc. they also won\u2019t listen as quick as they would their parents and might also test you. Presume nothing just to be sure. Enjoy spending the rest of the time with her.", "Thanks for the advice!", "You are not overreacting.\nHave you told your parents? This is very concerning as the coach, a paid employee, verbally agreed to your request and did nothing. Your sister could\u2019ve been seriously injured. Has this happened to other parents/carers at this facility? Does this coach have a history of children wandering off during his lessons? This could affect his insurance as an employee if something bad happened to your sister.", "My son took swimming lessons in a couple different places. Never did I have to sit right there and chaperone the entire lesson, in fact we weren't really allowed to be that close, and they weren't even one on one lessons, there were usually 3 or 4 other kids per instructor. \n\nI would have been livid if I were you. I probably wouldn't have paid for the lesson and I probably would have filed a complaint with the management. And if I were your parents, I'd pull her from lessons there and find someone else. \n\nIn my experience with any kind of child care or lessons, the teacher/instructor is fully responsible for any children in their care until they are handed off to their guardian. His behavior was super unprofessional and if your sister had actually been harmed he could have been sued.", "Probably edit your post to specify it was a busy parking lot and not a street because that makes more sense given it took only 3 mins for your sister to get out of the pool and look for you. NTA", "NTA", "YTA for leaving her with people she clearly didn't have a strong attachment to", "YTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYOU were negligent, YOU Were supposed to taske care of the kid - the coach was there to teach her swim, not to babysit. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd: Your sister hat time to wander around, so you took quite long.", "NTA. Nobody here is an asshole.\n\nThe Coach said \"Sure, we'll be right here\" is not an affirmation that they will attend to your sister. Likely the coach assumed that your sister would just stay there and not immediately run after you.\n\nYou should have made sure your sister understands that she should stay with the coach. Not just ask the coach to \"keep an eye on her\". ~~Its not his responsibility after the lesson.~~ Apparently there was still a bit of time left, so the coach definitely should have attended to her more closely!\n\nIt sounds to me like you just aren't experienced to handle small children. It can be scary when shit like this happens, but luckily nothing happened to her and you know now that you can't just leave your sister like this. Just make sure it doesn't happen again in your care!", "More info:\n\n\nDid you tell your sister you would be right back?\n\n\nIn the agreement, does an adult have to stay on site and watch the swim lesson? \n\n\nDoes the swim lesson usually have a \u201cend 5 minutes\u201d early? I cannot imagine a swim less going from say a full 60 minutes. Usually 10 minutes to get the kid in and out of the water? Reinforce what they did, etc.", "ESH You for how you handled this.\n\nThe swim coach because your sister could have been seriously injured.", "NTA, but I\u2019m concerned that a five year old hasn\u2019t been taught to stay on the sidewalk and not go into a parking lot or street without an adult. This is basic safety.", "If you want a small child to put their shoes and coat on, it will take them half the day because they are so slow.\n\nTake your eyes off that same child and in a minute they will\nbe out the door, down the street and wandering up a busy main road about to be crush by a bus. That is just how kids work.", "I think it would be even worse if she was left in the pool and he wasn't watching her, kids can drown quietly and quickly.", "I\u2019ve told my parents. They\u2019re currently dealing with the situation with the club. Other than that, I\u2019m not sure on the details.", "Ya, because 5 year olds are better at that sort of stuff. Still a child, dude. As a mother of five, I can tell you, the only difference between the ages of 5 and 2 is the fact that they can talk more ( and possibly are actually potty traind at 5 and not 2, depending on the kid). Also, the sister was likely anxious about not seeing her brother, and the coach ignoring her in favor of the next client (which is bs also since her time wasn't up).", "Yeah, that\u2019s understandable. I had assumed that since she\u2019d been going to these lessons regularly with the same coach, that it\u2019d be okay to step out briefly. But then again, my parents are usually at the cafe/food area so she\u2019d see them immediately after getting out of the pool. So, I get that being alone could\u2019ve caused her a lot of stress.", "If you read OP's comments, they clearly state that the guardians are usually elsewhere during the lessons, leaving the kids with the instructor. There was still time in the lesson when OP left as well.", "Also INFo- did you tell your sister where you were going and to stay with the coach? Is your parents routine with her to bring her with them to the parking lot? I\u2019m just wondering if she was confused and scared because she thought you were leaving without her so she ran off after you, not realising you were coming back. Her coach is basically a stranger to her, she might not be comfortable staying alone with them. Not saying you are wrong, just wondering. Not sure how long your sister has been in your family but adopted kids often have insecurities and might react more strongly to a safe adult leaving.", "right, because she saw big brother leave and followed him. she got scared when she couldnt find him. I would NOT have paid that coach either.", "Next time, though, tell the little one you're stepping out for a few minutes, why, and who is taking care of her.\n\nShe likely looked up, didn't see you, and panicked.", "My local pool has no special enclosure surrounding just the pool. There is a fence around the entire facility (outside pool, picnic area, grandstand etc), a brick entrance housing the change rooms/bathrooms and office with big metal gates that are open while the pool is open. So theoretically during swimming lessons a child could get out of the pool and make it to the parking lot/road without an issue if supervision is sketchy", "They absolutely can be with the right parenting. And as a parent and an Early Childhood Educator I can tell you that there are massive differences between a 2 year old and a 5 year old in all developmental areas unless the 5 year old is developmentally delayed or has some other condition. \nAlso do you just expect the instructor to ignore someone who talks to him?", "Even so, she was left unattended and was able to go out all by herself during her lesson time\u2026 the info you are asking are irrelevant to the fact that he was not even aware she wasn\u2019t in the pool anymore.", "Oh, I see. You're acting like a 5 year old! So, your saying g you understand better because you're the same age as the sister! Got it!"]}
