I put a lot of love, planning, and effort into making it a really special day. \n\nThis year, between work, parenting, and everything else, I\u2019m tired and I don\u2019t want to cook Thanksgiving. I went to him and asked if we could just go to a nice restaurant instead. To my surprise, he said he\u2019d handle it.\n\nHowever, even cooking a simple Thanksgiving meal requires forethought, like getting the frozen turkey in the fridge to defrost multiple days in advance. NOW is the time to pick up some items. I don\u2019t know if he knows what he signed up for. \n\nI started asking when he was planning on doing his grocery run and what dishes he was planning to serve. He just dodged the question and said he\u2019d handle it. He has a habit of underestimating tasks and rushing last minute.\n\nI finally was like, \u201cLook, why don\u2019t we work together and start planning?\u201d He admitted he was only going to cook a simple meal of turkey breast, mashed potatoes, and broccoli. That\u2019s it. \n\nBasically, I said that\u2019s not really a special holiday dinner and I wouldn\u2019t have agreed to that had I know that\u2019s what he meant. I said I\u2019d be happy to work together and balance simple like he wants and special like I want. I suggested turkey, potatoes, packet gravy, box stuffing, pre-made mac and cheese, canned cranberry sauce, broccoli, rolls, and a store made pie.\n\nHe got really defensive and made it about him versus me, very black and white (your way or my way), his offer isn\u2019t good enough to me, I\u2019m just trying to get my way. When I explained no, that\u2019s not what I mean, he insisted I did.\n\nI cannot imagine family showing up and being served a very simple meal like that, it\u2019s just bad holiday hosting. Maybe coordinating a potluck would be okay, but he wasn\u2019t doing that. We already committed to hosting them.\n\nAITA?\n\nTL;DR husband offered to cook thanksgiving dinner for the first time instead of me, unbeknownst to me until now his offer was only to cook turkey, potatoes, and broccoli.

Let him also come up with a solution and write it off as something you can look back on and laugh at. It's not your responsibility to preemptively fix this, or fix it if it goes wrong.

No way a single turkey breast is gonna feed more than 6 - 8 people.\n\nAnd while some people will say YTA cause you weren't happy with his plans after leaving it up to him, you did try to compromise with him while you still had time to prepare.\n\nLet him simmer down for a day and try talking it out with him again.

A simple meal would be fine for the three of you. But for other family coming over? No way. It doesn't have to be a Martha Stewart spread, but you need dessert, more sides, beverages, etc. \n\nThe thing about hosting is that certain standards have to be maintained. I just made our Thanksgiving only the three of us because my husband did not get all his clutter and crap put away in time. I gave him two months' notice and told him that if he didn't get it put away, no guests. I can't cook and be hostess if I'm constantly worrying about clutter and crap everywhere.", "This is in the same ballpark of weaponized incompetence, depending on his attitude. If you get comments from his family, make sure to deflect to him as he planned and cooked the meal. If it turns out great, give him all the credit. If not, that\u2019s on him too. It\u2019s not fair of him to say that he\u2019s handling it, and then really not handling it. There is a certain standard for hosting. Like cooking a box of mac and cheese would really not cut it. Cooking a simple meal of chicken and broccoli is more of a single person\u2019s weeknight dinner than a thanksgiving dinner for extended family", "Omg NTA seriously though every other post today has been holiday hell related. That seriously sucks! Sorry OP you should book a nice hotel restaurant!!

I just don't think this plan was ever going to work and you knew that but let it get to this point.", "YTA He said he'll host, let him host. If it's a failure, oh well.

He can worry about familial expectations and the prospect of disappointing people that is emotional labour you don\u2019t have to do. Do not feel badly. Just sit back and let it play out.

I have a standard I want to meet when hosting and if my husband \u201ctook over\u201d it would be a complete disaster.  He doesn\u2019t know how to cook or plan.   \n\nWould he compromise on a catering plan? Some places will do almost all the work.

You are not overthinking this.", "Nta, I think he's wildly underestimating the effort required and I can't blame you for trying to help out.\n\nIt would have been great if he started earlier and was more proactive about the groceries, but it is very nice that he intends to take on the burden. Problem is, this doesn't sound like something he can just throw together and maybe he should've done a practice run earlier in the year.\n\n*that said though*, what the in-laws might expect or demand shouldn't really be the core of the issue. Not everything needs to be the same and a one-off where your husband is finding his feet should not be the end of the world. \n\nAnd maybe he'll try to do it next year too, make that his tradition.", "NTA but can\u2019t you let him cook the turkey, mash and broccoli and you do stuffing, gravy and just buy rolls and dessert.

You don't want to cook Thanksgiving dinner. I get that. I stopped a few years ago. My husband gets a nice dinner from a local restaurant for us instead.

He said he would do it. He's not doing it like you did, that's true, but you either do it or let him do it. It is controlling to refuse to do something but then want to tell the other person how to do it. I've given control of holiday dinners to my husband. He \\*did\\* cook the first couple of them.

What is the cost of letting him do so?  I take it you would feel embarrassed by having a three-ingredient dinner?  I would, too, but he did step up, this is his family, and it is obvious that he is in charge of the kitchen, not you.  I suggest maybe having a storebought pumpkin pie or two, and a platter of nuts and pickles to graze on...otherwise let him cook.  It's on him, if his family doesn't like it.

Sit down and offer suggestions. Suggest another side or two and even a store made dessert. Don\u2019t say that\u2019s how you would do it. Don\u2019t make it a competition. Just a suggestion.

All of the items I just gave you, all cooked & ready, would be on the table in 30 minutes, if he suddenly realizes that his effort wasn't enough.  Just boil your kettle ahead of time, so you don't need to wait.  Use hot tap water to start cooking the frozen veggies.\n\nLet him do his thing. If he realizes that it's not going to do, then cheerfully pull out the food you had earmarked for the weekend.  No fuss. Just \"feed the masses\", and you can talk about it later.

He's an adult, not a child to be managed.", "And if you inform them about the menu in advance, they can then either prepare for the disappointment, prepare and bring additional food, or address it directly with hubby. \n\nDo NOT take over, do NOT do the planning, do NOT organise a pot luck behind his back. But DO forewarn your guests.\n\nThis is not a life or death situation. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s neither the first or last disappointing meal your guests will ever eat.", "Baaaaaad. Really really bad.", "That is not a YOU problem, it is a THEM problem. You only need to solve your own problems.", "You could always just not invite them. They kind of sound awful. I\u2019m annoyed for you that they expect you to make a full thanksgiving with no help every year.", "Unfortunately in this case that means she *also* doesn\u2019t get the holiday meal that she wants.\n\nI know that I would much, *much* rather cook a meal that I want to eat than eat a disappointing meal I don\u2019t like (and disappoint invited guests) to prove a point that the person cooking likely won\u2019t even get.", "I absolutely love all of the sarcasm in this post", "Why should she tell them? It\u2019s his family and if they are already going to berate her if it goes poorly then the least he can do is tell his own family that he is cooking/ asked to cook/wants to cook.", "YES... THIS! \u261d\ufe0f and be sincere!\n\nyou are TA if you try to do it any other way. \n\nenjoy the day for the gathering, not the food. it's not going to kill anyone to have a simple meal. and if there's not enough food, order pizza! it might end up being the funniest thanksgiving ever! and there's always next year to redeem yourself.\n\n(oh, and btw, you absolutely *were* trying to have your own way ... to have the big, old meal. there's nothing wrong with that, but he was right ... you were trying to do that.)", "This isn\u2019t really fair to the other guests though who are expecting a holiday dinner. Some may not come.", "That appears to be his strategy.", "Who cares?", "Or he doesn\u2019t cook much cause he\u2019s probably an electrician or some shit, and now he\u2019s being asked to cook the most important meal of the whole year.", "You\u2019re right, he\u2019s not. And he\u2019s not listening to you, or thinking about his family and what they would like to eat. He is being selfish and weaponizing his incompetence. \n\nLet him fail. Let him stand there with his turkey breast and broccoli and tell his family \u201cthis is what I made you\u201d. \n\nAnd if anyone asks? \u201cHusband insisted on doing it himself. I suggested a nice restaurant, but he insisted on this.\u201d", "Full Thanksgiving AND Christmas every year, for 16 years That's just so much. I don't blame OP for being burned out, but she kind of signed up for that. Maybe she's a little controlling and likes having things a certain way and likes the praise that comes with hosting basically all on her own and fulfilling an expected gender role. Just speculating because I have no idea why someone would agree to this and family would never step in to help.", "Warning!  If she tells them to bring potluck but tells her husband she knows he can handle it, we all know it *will* get back to him and cause more drama in the end.  The potluck is a good idea otherwise.", "I do agree with you. But I feel for OP, who doesn't appear to be in a winnable situation here. I'd say hopefully for Christmas, her hubby will hopefully see the light. But for Thanksgiving unless her ridiculous husband has a change of heart, she might have to just let this one go...", "I absolutely agree that hubby should tell his family that he's doing all the cooking and she had nothing to do with it. But I'm betting chances are that when push comes to shoe, on thanksgiving day, he'll be more than happy to let her take the blame, ie \"Its her fault for being too busy\" or \"I did my best but this is her job.\" or just stay silent when the family is looking down upon her and not say a word in her defense.", "Sounds lovely. My family would love that, except I'm highly allergic to shellfish. Late in life allergy and I dearly miss shrimp scampi. \n\nI hope you enjoy your new traditional Thanksgiving meal!", "Thank you. It has just been hard. It was unexpected and she was one of my BFF, as well as Mom. I was her caregiver since 2009 and we both were Dad's caregivers since the 90s.\n\nI'm sorry for your loss as well. I hope your holiday is at least peaceful. \n\nMy brother was steak??!! That's expensive! I was do you know how much we spent on Thanksgiving for years?? This actually will be cheaper. I think he forgot all the food we brought, so that everyone could have leftovers for days and days. lol", "Like she said in another comment, that'd be over and underfunctioning.", "Seriously, how TF do you make a meatloaf that's still raw in the center unless you are actively trying?\n\nMeatloaf was a staple meal my first year of adulthood because it was fail-proof.", "Absolutely not!

Don't go behind his back to predict his failure.", "I also feel like this would get thrown back in her face till the end of time.\n\n\u201cHoney I\u2019m swamped at work, can you handle dinner tonight?\u201d \u201cNope, last time I tried to help you got all pissy remember?\u201d\u201d", "What's also embarrassing is the minimal effort he's putting in to create a pathetic holiday meal that literally isn't enough to feed all the people coming who could have stayed home or had someone else host if they'd known he didn't care about them enough to try (or admit defeat/being overwhelmed and accept help). \n\nEveryone shouldn't have to suffer so your husband can save face despite deliberately messing this up.", "I agree with you. I wouldn't go behind my husband's back. That would make for fireworks later. We would work something out between us.", "OP is not accepting YOUR judgement.  Plenty of commenters don\u2019t agree that you are correct.", "And tell them EXACTLY what his menu is.", "So much this. I am begging OP not to allow this weaponized incompetence. OP offered compromises, he's the one who can only have it his way or not at all. So don't compromise. Let him have it his way. Please."]}
