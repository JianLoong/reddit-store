I put a lot of love, planning, and effort into making it a really special day. \n\nThis year, between work, parenting, and everything else, I\u2019m tired and I don\u2019t want to cook Thanksgiving. I went to him and asked if we could just go to a nice restaurant instead. To my surprise, he said he\u2019d handle it.\n\nHowever, even cooking a simple Thanksgiving meal requires forethought, like getting the frozen turkey in the fridge to defrost multiple days in advance. NOW is the time to pick up some items. I don\u2019t know if he knows what he signed up for. \n\nI started asking when he was planning on doing his grocery run and what dishes he was planning to serve. He just dodged the question and said he\u2019d handle it. He has a habit of underestimating tasks and rushing last minute.\n\nI finally was like, \u201cLook, why don\u2019t we work together and start planning?\u201d He admitted he was only going to cook a simple meal of turkey breast, mashed potatoes, and broccoli. That\u2019s it. \n\nBasically, I said that\u2019s not really a special holiday dinner and I wouldn\u2019t have agreed to that had I know that\u2019s what he meant. I said I\u2019d be happy to work together and balance simple like he wants and special like I want. I suggested turkey, potatoes, packet gravy, box stuffing, pre-made mac and cheese, canned cranberry sauce, broccoli, rolls, and a store made pie.\n\nHe got really defensive and made it about him versus me, very black and white (your way or my way), his offer isn\u2019t good enough to me, I\u2019m just trying to get my way. When I explained no, that\u2019s not what I mean, he insisted I did.\n\nI cannot imagine family showing up and being served a very simple meal like that, it\u2019s just bad holiday hosting. Maybe coordinating a potluck would be okay, but he wasn\u2019t doing that. We already committed to hosting them.\n\nAITA?\n\nTL;DR husband offered to cook thanksgiving dinner for the first time instead of me, unbeknownst to me until now his offer was only to cook turkey, potatoes, and broccoli.

He knew his incompetence and your pride would ensure you took it back over. He wanted kudos for being a good husband for OFFERING to cook, knowing full well he wouldn\u2019t have to.

I completely understand where you are coming from as I'm also someone who likes to go all out for holidays and understand what a big deal it is...but if he fails, so what? Let him also come up with a solution and write it off as something you can look back on and laugh at. It's not your responsibility to preemptively fix this, or fix it if it goes wrong.

No way a single turkey breast is gonna feed more than 6 - 8 people.\n\nAnd while some people will say YTA cause you weren't happy with his plans after leaving it up to him, you did try to compromise with him while you still had time to prepare.\n\nLet him simmer down for a day and try talking it out with him again.

How is it that for 16 years your husband has seen the type of Thanksgiving dinner that you provided to him and the rest of the family and then for him in return to cook the lowest standard meal for a special occasion?

I hope you see your worth and ask for more from him!", "I'm of the opinion YTA, and I say that because he agreed to take the responsibility off your hands and you insisted on making it your problem anyways.\n\nSure, what he's planned doesn't sound like the typical \"work yourself to death making it\" Thanksgiving his family is expecting, and that you've done for 16 years, but again: his problem.\n\nIf you ask him to handle something, you have to accept it's not going to be identical to what you would have done, for better or worse.", "ESH.\n\nHe was planning this all along.

Buy a load of back up oven ready frozen pizzas and a shedload of crisps, snacks and alcohol. Baileys. This is what this day calls for. Stick your feet up, decide whether you want to let him burn or call his mum and tell her he's cooking and watch her rush in to do it all for him.", "NTA. A simple meal would be fine for the three of you. But for other family coming over? No way. It doesn't have to be a Martha Stewart spread, but you need dessert, more sides, beverages, etc. \n\nThe thing about hosting is that certain standards have to be maintained. I just made our Thanksgiving only the three of us because my husband did not get all his clutter and crap put away in time. I gave him two months' notice and told him that if he didn't get it put away, no guests. I can't cook and be hostess if I'm constantly worrying about clutter and crap everywhere.", "This is in the same ballpark of weaponized incompetence, depending on his attitude. If you get comments from his family, make sure to deflect to him as he planned and cooked the meal. If it turns out great, give him all the credit. If not, that\u2019s on him too. It\u2019s not fair of him to say that he\u2019s handling it, and then really not handling it. There is a certain standard for hosting. Like cooking a box of mac and cheese would really not cut it. Cooking a simple meal of chicken and broccoli is more of a single person\u2019s weeknight dinner than a thanksgiving dinner for extended family", "Omg NTA seriously though every other post today has been holiday hell related. That seriously sucks! Sorry OP you should book a nice hotel restaurant!!

I just don't think this plan was ever going to work and you knew that but let it get to this point.", "YTA He said he'll host, let him host. If it's a failure, oh well. Not your problem.", "Nope - no backup food, no warnings, no asking extended family to bring dishes. He said he would handle it, so let him. If the food is inedible don\u2019t worry. He can worry about familial expectations and the prospect of disappointing people that is emotional labour you don\u2019t have to do. Do not feel badly. Just sit back and let it play out.

I would honestly be a little disappointed if that was all there was for Thanksgiving too. I think working as a team is a great compromise.", "Nta and exactly the situation I would find myself in.  I have a standard I want to meet when hosting and if my husband \u201ctook over\u201d it would be a complete disaster.  He doesn\u2019t know how to cook or plan.   \n\nWould he compromise on a catering plan? Some places will do almost all the work.

Check out some of the meal deals from grocery stores.  It might be a good compromise.", "Why are you and your husband doing all the work?

You are not overthinking this.", "Nta, I think he's wildly underestimating the effort required and I can't blame you for trying to help out.\n\nIt would have been great if he started earlier and was more proactive about the groceries, but it is very nice that he intends to take on the burden. Problem is, this doesn't sound like something he can just throw together and maybe he should've done a practice run earlier in the year.\n\n*that said though*, what the in-laws might expect or demand shouldn't really be the core of the issue. Not everything needs to be the same and a one-off where your husband is finding his feet should not be the end of the world. \n\nAnd maybe he'll try to do it next year too, make that his tradition.", "NTA but can\u2019t you let him cook the turkey, mash and broccoli and you do stuffing, gravy and just buy rolls and dessert.

And then he didn't even wanna do any real planning with you.\n\nThanksgiving is NOT the time to do any experimenting. Ever.\n\nBecause he's either doing that or trying to manipulate you into just deciding to cook the whole 9 yards like you usually do.\n\nYou need to play interference right now and make sure you tell Every.

You don't want to cook Thanksgiving dinner. I get that. I stopped a few years ago. My husband gets a nice dinner from a local restaurant for us instead. (This year, prime rib w truffle au jus and horseradish cream, garlic mashed, kabocha squash, orzo pasta salad, roasted carrots, crispy brussel sprouts and pumpkin tiramisu) But then you can't turn around and say he's doing it wrong. He said he would do it. He's not doing it like you did, that's true, but you either do it or let him do it. It is controlling to refuse to do something but then want to tell the other person how to do it. I've given control of holiday dinners to my husband. He \\*did\\* cook the first couple of them.

What is the cost of letting him do so?  I take it you would feel embarrassed by having a three-ingredient dinner?  I would, too, but he did step up, this is his family, and it is obvious that he is in charge of the kitchen, not you.  I suggest maybe having a storebought pumpkin pie or two, and a platter of nuts and pickles to graze on...otherwise let him cook.  It's on him, if his family doesn't like it.

Sit down and offer suggestions. Suggest another side or two and even a store made dessert. Don\u2019t say that\u2019s how you would do it. Don\u2019t make it a competition. Just a suggestion.
