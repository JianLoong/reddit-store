I put a lot of love, planning, and effort into making it a really special day. \n\nThis year, between work, parenting, and everything else, I\u2019m tired and I don\u2019t want to cook Thanksgiving. I went to him and asked if we could just go to a nice restaurant instead. To my surprise, he said he\u2019d handle it.\n\nHowever, even cooking a simple Thanksgiving meal requires forethought, like getting the frozen turkey in the fridge to defrost multiple days in advance. NOW is the time to pick up some items. I don\u2019t know if he knows what he signed up for. \n\nI started asking when he was planning on doing his grocery run and what dishes he was planning to serve. He just dodged the question and said he\u2019d handle it. He has a habit of underestimating tasks and rushing last minute.\n\nI finally was like, \u201cLook, why don\u2019t we work together and start planning?\u201d He admitted he was only going to cook a simple meal of turkey breast, mashed potatoes, and broccoli. That\u2019s it. \n\nBasically, I said that\u2019s not really a special holiday dinner and I wouldn\u2019t have agreed to that had I know that\u2019s what he meant. I said I\u2019d be happy to work together and balance simple like he wants and special like I want. I suggested turkey, potatoes, packet gravy, box stuffing, pre-made mac and cheese, canned cranberry sauce, broccoli, rolls, and a store made pie.\n\nHe got really defensive and made it about him versus me, very black and white (your way or my way), his offer isn\u2019t good enough to me, I\u2019m just trying to get my way. When I explained no, that\u2019s not what I mean, he insisted I did.\n\nI cannot imagine family showing up and being served a very simple meal like that, it\u2019s just bad holiday hosting. Maybe coordinating a potluck would be okay, but he wasn\u2019t doing that. We already committed to hosting them.\n\nAITA?\n\nTL;DR husband offered to cook thanksgiving dinner for the first time instead of me, unbeknownst to me until now his offer was only to cook turkey, potatoes, and broccoli.

Let him also come up with a solution and write it off as something you can look back on and laugh at. It's not your responsibility to preemptively fix this, or fix it if it goes wrong.

No way a single turkey breast is gonna feed more than 6 - 8 people.\n\nAnd while some people will say YTA cause you weren't happy with his plans after leaving it up to him, you did try to compromise with him while you still had time to prepare.\n\nLet him simmer down for a day and try talking it out with him again.

Stick your feet up, decide whether you want to let him burn or call his mum and tell her he's cooking and watch her rush in to do it all for him.", "NTA. A simple meal would be fine for the three of you. But for other family coming over? No way. It doesn't have to be a Martha Stewart spread, but you need dessert, more sides, beverages, etc. \n\nThe thing about hosting is that certain standards have to be maintained. I just made our Thanksgiving only the three of us because my husband did not get all his clutter and crap put away in time. I gave him two months' notice and told him that if he didn't get it put away, no guests. I can't cook and be hostess if I'm constantly worrying about clutter and crap everywhere.", "This is in the same ballpark of weaponized incompetence, depending on his attitude. If you get comments from his family, make sure to deflect to him as he planned and cooked the meal. If it turns out great, give him all the credit. If not, that\u2019s on him too. It\u2019s not fair of him to say that he\u2019s handling it, and then really not handling it. There is a certain standard for hosting. Like cooking a box of mac and cheese would really not cut it. Cooking a simple meal of chicken and broccoli is more of a single person\u2019s weeknight dinner than a thanksgiving dinner for extended family", "Omg NTA seriously though every other post today has been holiday hell related. That seriously sucks! Sorry OP you should book a nice hotel restaurant!!

I just don't think this plan was ever going to work and you knew that but let it get to this point.", "YTA He said he'll host, let him host. If it's a failure, oh well.

He can worry about familial expectations and the prospect of disappointing people that is emotional labour you don\u2019t have to do. Do not feel badly. Just sit back and let it play out.

I have a standard I want to meet when hosting and if my husband \u201ctook over\u201d it would be a complete disaster.  He doesn\u2019t know how to cook or plan.   \n\nWould he compromise on a catering plan? Some places will do almost all the work.

You are not overthinking this.", "Nta, I think he's wildly underestimating the effort required and I can't blame you for trying to help out.\n\nIt would have been great if he started earlier and was more proactive about the groceries, but it is very nice that he intends to take on the burden. Problem is, this doesn't sound like something he can just throw together and maybe he should've done a practice run earlier in the year.\n\n*that said though*, what the in-laws might expect or demand shouldn't really be the core of the issue. Not everything needs to be the same and a one-off where your husband is finding his feet should not be the end of the world. \n\nAnd maybe he'll try to do it next year too, make that his tradition.", "NTA but can\u2019t you let him cook the turkey, mash and broccoli and you do stuffing, gravy and just buy rolls and dessert.

And then he didn't even wanna do any real planning with you.\n\nThanksgiving is NOT the time to do any experimenting.

You don't want to cook Thanksgiving dinner. I get that. I stopped a few years ago. My husband gets a nice dinner from a local restaurant for us instead.

He said he would do it. He's not doing it like you did, that's true, but you either do it or let him do it. It is controlling to refuse to do something but then want to tell the other person how to do it. I've given control of holiday dinners to my husband. He \\*did\\* cook the first couple of them.

What is the cost of letting him do so?  I take it you would feel embarrassed by having a three-ingredient dinner?  I would, too, but he did step up, this is his family, and it is obvious that he is in charge of the kitchen, not you.  I suggest maybe having a storebought pumpkin pie or two, and a platter of nuts and pickles to graze on...otherwise let him cook.  It's on him, if his family doesn't like it.

Sit down and offer suggestions. Suggest another side or two and even a store made dessert. Don\u2019t say that\u2019s how you would do it. Don\u2019t make it a competition. Just a suggestion.

All of the items I just gave you, all cooked & ready, would be on the table in 30 minutes, if he suddenly realizes that his effort wasn't enough.  Just boil your kettle ahead of time, so you don't need to wait.  Use hot tap water to start cooking the frozen veggies.\n\nLet him do his thing. If he realizes that it's not going to do, then cheerfully pull out the food you had earmarked for the weekend.  No fuss. Just \"feed the masses\", and you can talk about it later.

The meal will probably be mediocre, and you're already stressing out about his approach to the meal. You won't get the Thanksgiving meal you and family members want. Will this cause you more stress and unhappiness?\n\nGive in and cook the meal as usual. This puts a lot of work and stress on you. It may reinforce to your husband that it's okay for him to be incompetent; you'll step in and fix things for him so he doesn't have to try. You will have a good meal, and don't have to worry about disappointing family members. You won't get to rest or relax.\n\nYou could scrap the meal and go out. Make a reservation at someplace you all enjoy. Bonus: no dishes and cleanup to do. Negatives: again, may undercut your husband and reinforce that he's incapable.\n\nYou could let everyone know ahead of time that you need to relax, and your husband will be cooking. Since this is his first time making the meal, he could use some help. Ask people what they can bring to round out the meal. Yes, this is helping him to not fail, but also it still holds him to a good amount of responsibility. His vision of hosting a dinner is different from yours; he probably has never considered how much work goes into the meal and planning before, if you typically do it all. This would let you relax, since he's still in charge, but invites other people to help him, not you. Don't go behind his back, though.\n\nYou could order Thanksgiving dinner from a local store. It may be too late for this, but you could try. You would have to be strong enough to stay out of the kitchen. He's an adult; he ought to be able to handle putting things into the oven and following a schedule. However, you may feel stressed about whether or not he's doing it right, which would make it hard to relax.\n\nGo out by yourself. Watch a movie. Get takeout. Silence your phone. Enjoy a day to yourself, and let your husband deal with the fallout from his plan all on his own.\n\nThose are the main options I can think of. There is no perfect solution to your problem. You can get involved, to varying degrees, or you can stay out of it. You need to balance out what will make you happy, and what will cause you the least amount of stress.\n\nIs your husband in the habit of using weaponized incompetence? If so, I'd let him flounder. Let him fail and face the consequences. If he's pretty good about most things but just clueless when it comes to complicated issues like planning a big meal, then I'd be more flexible with helping a little. I personally like the idea of Thanksgiving potluck, but that's also what my family always does. Having one person have to cook the entire meal for everyone is incredibly demanding! No wonder you're exhausted. This could be a good opportunity to step back and ask for some help. Set up a new tradition, where you don't have to take all of the meal planning and hosting on your shoulders. There's no reason you should have to do it all by yourself every holiday.", "Absolutely.

This is so messed up. If I had known his standards for hosting a holiday meal were SO different than mine, I would have just done it myself from the get-go OR I would have insisted on a reservation OR a premade meal kit. He DOES NOT need to go to the lengths I do, not at all. I'm a skilled cook AND I enjoy it most of the time. Premade or box items would be fine.\n\nIt's important to me that family feels cared for and loved when they're guests in our home. Doing what in my mind is less than the bare minimum is so shitty.

Someone can\u2019t simply wake up one day and whip up a holiday feast without prior experience. I\u2019m the primary cook in my house too. If I\u2019m too tired to cook, my husband will do it but within his skill set, i.e tacos or boxes popcorn chicken with a simple side or burgers, instead of the much fancier dinner I would have made. \n\nSo I think YTA for OP.

He agreed to make Thanksgiving dinner and he is not making even half of it.", "Because it isn't good enough if you've volunteered to host a holiday dinner and is disrespectful to your guests.

This year she wants a special meal but is burned out and doesn't want to do the work. She has offered several solutions like going out to eat, catering or take and bake items from the store. She's offering canned cranberry! Why on earth can't he source a can of gelatinous cranberry and dump it on a plate?

There's too many to reply to each.\n\nI can see how I wanted this to be handled would come off as controlling to him, but honestly, I'd rather be seen as controlling in this instance over potentially letting my husband fail in front of the family and disappointing them. **I've come to the conclusion that I'm okay with being the AH in this instance.**\n\nTo clarify:\n\n1. I did not ask him to cook. He offered. He insisted.\n2. I did not expect him to cook exactly like I do. Mostly boxed or premade items would be fine, but we need to show our guests a nice time and have them leave feeling satisfied IMHO. In my value system, having guests means taking on the responsibility of making sure they have a good time and don't leave hungry. They're giving us this day of their lives!\n3. Cooking these meals doesn't make me miserable. I usually like it and am happy to take on the responsibility. I'm just really tired this year and I want someone else to take a turn. I guess it was a mistake not to get specific about expectations. Like I said, if I had known this was his plan, I would have handled it differently. I just can't imagine anyone thinking those three items is enough for a holiday meal. My mind is a little blown.\n4. I don't think it's conscious weaponized incompetence. I think he really thinks this meal is good enough for him and doesn't care if anyone else agrees. I think that's kind of self-centered. Our daughter, for example, would only eat the broccoli (she hates turkey and potatoes). Including items for picky eaters is usually part of my meal planning (kids get ham, mac and cheese, etc).\n5. I really was trying to find a compromise between simple and special so we both felt heard. He wasn't having it. It was a majorly tense and defensive discussion.\n6. All of the suggestions of coordinating a potluck or ordering ready-made items are great suggestions. That's the kind of mental labor I would expect someone to do if they were taking over this and didn't feel up to cooking everything. He didn't step up to do that and it's a little late for that. And that would still be me handling Thanksgiving, again.\n7. He has never suggested that the meals I cooked in the past were \"too much\" or that he wanted something simpler to relieve stress. That's not what's happening here. In fact, in the past he sometimes has made sarcastic jokes when his favorite items were missing, like \"Where's the shrimp cocktail?\" or \"Just a ham? No beef wellington?\"\n8. For me, this is also about having a nice holiday meal without having to be the one to cook it. Hearing it was going to be just a basic meal was a big bummer.\n\nI'll add more thoughts in this comment as they come up.", "I'm actually going to go with ESH because I think your communication is lacking on both ends and it sounds like each of you are responding to many years of unresolved issues, not the situation at hand. \n\nHe's feeling, \"This is another example of OP being controlling and accusing me of being inadequate.\" \n\nYou're feeling, \"This is another example of Husband underappreciating my work, failing to plan, and not being considerate to my values.\" \n\nAll while neither of you seem to really be talking with one another through the options. \n\nI would bet that the reason he offered to take prepping the meal was that he didn't want to foot the family bill. In a traditionalist family, if the host invited everyone out for a holiday meal, they pick up the bill. That would he a huge expense. Even if he had planned to amend the invite and let everyone pick up their own tab, that would likely be seen as quite gauche as well, building the impression your family is cheap. (This is especially true if you and your husband are well-to-do relative to the majority of his family.) Still, he should have been open about that. It sounds like he wasn't because he wanted to acknowledge that you're over-extended and solve this problem *for* you instead of solving it *with* you. \n\nWhen two partner enter a cycle of solving/doing for one another and not with one another, its almost always going to lead to resentment. That's because, at a fundamental level, you're putting each of your needs at odds with one another and then equating a lack of communication with martyrdom. \n\nTalk WITH your husband. \"Sweetheart, I'm sorry I hurt your feelings. I don't want this to be a me vs you issue. I would like to be able to host your family for a lovely holiday. I appreciate your willingness to take this task off my plate and see that throwing you into the deep end of holiday planning without support likely felt like a lot to ask. I want to support you too, not take over. Without judgment, I wanted to ask if this menu is what you want to serve or simply what you feel comfortable cooking?\" Then problem solve from there. \n\nYour husband may share that this process actually has been very overwhelming and he would appreciate if you did the shopping while he did the cooking or if you wrote a list for him and he did the rest. \n\nYou've been hosting this event for over a decade. That means you've had a really long time to perfect your expectations, process, and recipes. He hasn't. So while it might be frustrating to see him 'fail', it shouldn't be unexpected.

Send this verbatim and let us know how thanksgiving goes down!", "It's hard to figure out what you even have the power to do in this situation. There's also the issue that unless this is a breaking point for your relationship, you need to work with your husband somehow even if he's in the wrong.\n\n\nSeems the two options are: \"win the argument\" by letting him cook, and disappoint all your guests and have a sucky Thanksgiving. Or fight him, and save Thanksgiving for your guests but worsen your working relationship with your husband because it involved you giving in to weaponized incompetence, or blowing up at each other, or both.\n\n\nMost people are recommending the first option but I agree with you it really sucks. And I think your standards aren't that unreasonable. There is \"when someone volunteers to do something, let them do it their way because your way is not always the best way and even if it is, people need autonomy & to learn from their mistakes\". And then there's \"when someone volunteers to do something they should *actually do the thing*\", and your big problem here is that your husband *isn't doing the thing*. A Thanksgiving meal where everyone is disappointed because of the ordinary food isn't \"a Thanksgiving meal\" and isn't what your husband had promised to do, and his failure to do so will impact you negatively.\n\n\nIn terms of fighting... Is it too late for restaurant reservations? Even better but less likely, can you afford to *throw away money* on restaurant reservations? If you want to make Thanksgiving OK for the guests in a way that's within your power, that could be a simpler option than constantly fighting in the kitchen. It could also have the benefit, if you can afford it, to function as a backup plan. It wouldn't *prevent* your husband from cooking the best meal he can but it would ensure things weren't too bad if he didn't manage.\n\n\nIn terms of talking with your husband I'd normally say you need to find some way of talking about things that will reduce defensiveness, that assumes good faith and intelligence on both sides and tries to figure out us vs the problem instead of me vs you, but in this case emotions are so high it's not clear whether this is even possible. And if course if he's in total bad faith it's not at all. Still. The argument at the moment is about cooking a meal, but it's really about hosting an enjoyable Thanksgiving dinner for all. Our current assumption is that your husband is focused on the first while you are worried about the second, and that you're both so angry that you're probably not going to change his mind just by saying this - he'll just see it as one more way of trying to win the argument and put him down or something. Now let's imagine that we're wrong, that he IS thinking about hosting a good Thanksgiving dinner, and he is making good choices, or good-enough choices. Say, it happens he knows something you don't that makes him sure that everyone will have an enjoyable Thanksgiving with the meal he prepares. Or even, he knows they won't but he has good reason to want this outcome, like they did something horrible to him recently and this is righteous revenge. How could you guys resolve the argument if this were the situation? If you went to him saying \"OK we're having a fight about this but let me step back and try and understand how it looks like from your side\" and had him walk you through what his meal would be like, how it would be when all the family came, how would they react or what would they say, is this realistic, how would *you* react to being invited to a Thanksgiving dinner and having that as a meal... Do you think there's a chance he might accept himself that this meal wouldn't be satisfactory? Obviously best case scenario is that he successfully convinces you that his meal plan will work out great, in a classic communication winning the day victory. If he still refuses to admit that this whole thing is a bad idea (either because of pure bad faith, or refusal to engage, or because he can't face up to having messed up), having framed things in terms of the Thanksgiving event going well and not the cooking and walked through everything might be enough to give you \"grounds\" to hold a line - essentially go \"what matters to me is that Thanksgiving goes well, I am convinced that it won't the way things are going now and I still think that after hearing your arguments, so here's what I'm going to do about it\".\n\n\nWhatever happens, maybe relationship counseling could be something to look at in the future.

I don\u2019t know what my day is going to be like day of. So we ordered a whole thanksgiving dinner from Luby\u2019s. A whole Turkey, 3 sides, gravy, cranberries, stuffing, rolls, a pie and tea.  We can still have an amazing meal\u2026. Prepared by someone else. And I don\u2019t feel bad about it!! Lol", "Ohhhh OP we need post holiday TEA! \ud83d\ude05\ud83e\udd70", "I am also hoping for an update after Thanksgiving!!", "My husband wouldn\u2019t even try and half it. \nI know people are going to think I\u2019m being petty but I will not go for instant box crap.\nI\u2019m a trained, certified, and degree holding chef with pastry cert. \nI do NOT care if I\u2019m dying I will make thanksgiving and Christmas dragging myself before I reduce myself to crap.", "BECAUSE SHE WANTED TO GO TO A RESTAURANT AND HE WOULDN'T HEAR OF IT.", "I was married to this guy for 20 years. Get out. Get out now.", "how is suggesting buying some more items to feed ppl treating the husband as a child?", "I think the version you're missing is to tell the family husband is fully taking over the meal, and then let it happen as it happens. Firmly put it in his court and let him sink or swim by his own merits.", "Since you're already in therapy for it, my advice would be for you to grit your teeth and let it happen however it's going to happen.\n\nIt sounds like you also get performance satisfaction from doing a good job, and you're reacting to the loss of that satisfaction. Which is to be expected. But us overperformers need to learn to delegate without micromanaging, and just deal with it. That's the cost, and it can be an acceptable one once you absorb that it does free you.\n\nBut it sounds like you need to experience dropping the rope and surviving the experience just as much as your husband needs to learn to take on the responsibility. It could be that the judgment etc. is a projection of your feelings of failure. \n\nEven if your in-laws are assholes over your making their poor baby boy slave away on Thanksgiving, you'll know it isn't your responsibility if you truly delegate it. And that's an emotion that also has to be learned, that their feelings also aren't your responsibility if you don't take it on.", "Honey, \n\nItem 7 are textbook examples of him being passive aggressive using humor to tell you he thinks you went too far. Beef Wellington is an incredibly difficult item to prepare so him comparing your spread to that IS him telling you he thinks you've gone overboard.", "I cook thanksgiving/Christmas dinner not my wife and the praise I get for doing if from the in-laws is absolutely ridiculous for cooking a meal. MIL expects to help and has worn me down into letting her bring cranberry sauce.  Otherwise get out of my kitchen.  My wife finds the whole thing hilarious because she can't cook(I've always done the cooking) and for some stupid reason people expect her to cook a fancy Christmas dinner.", "No. He means it. I\u2019ve made beef wellington many times before.", "If you do this OP, there is a very good chance this meal spontaneously turns into a potluck, if his family knows him well. This is an excellent strategy wither way.", "Yummy!  At least they'll all get a spoonful!  \ud83e\udd23", "Omg no, she's going to do it herself? Damn ...", "Yup, she mentioned it in the comments and then added an edit to the main post. Frankly, out of the available options, I think that one is one of the worst, because it involves her not holding the boundary she set that she won\u2019t be cooking."]}
