So even if a muslim man feels uncomfortable with being alone with a \"stranger\" woman, he will not be uncomfortable with his SIL.

I don\u2019t see the need to judge other\u2019s religious practices generally, when all members of a family share the same beliefs, but it concerns me if religion is used to justify one of two people in a couple having no say about house rules. And if she\u2019s between a rock and a hard place, and the hard place is her own husband, that sounds like a really uncomfortable situation. You don\u2019t say if she lived in a majority Muslim country or not.

Or the more unfortunate reality, her husband is a creep and she knows it. It still wants you to be a him... Yeah no", "I mean, are you napping in the same room as her husband? I assume not. \n\nMy husband is muslim. I have sisters. In the event that they are at my house napping and I for some reason have an errand to run, i wouldn\u2019t force my sisters to wake up and come with me. I trust both my husband and my sisters. If something \u201csinful\u201d were to happen, i would be upset, but ultimately that is up to God to judge their actions, not me. \n\nI realize that sisters-in-law are non-mahram for muslim men (meaning, in the event of divorce, they are still eligible for marriage to their previous sister-in-law), so there are extra responsibilities/precautions to be taken with interactions between the two that you would not take for mahram (family members NOT eligible or marriage, such a mother-in-laws, blood/milk siblings, uncles/aunts, etc.). Ensuring that non-mahram are not in the same space together ALONE is a common precaution. But that doesn\u2019t mean that existing in the same space with non-mahram is a sin, particularly if there are walled divisions. \n\nThe easiest solution would have been to suggest napping in a private room and perhaps locking the door. That should be sufficient. AND it should have been explained to you before you came to visit that this is the dynamic between muslims and non-mahram.\n\nIm not sure if your sister is untrusting of her husband or if the husband is truly super uncomfortable with being in the house alone with a non-mahram. But that is on your sister and her husband to find a solution to that doesn\u2019t impact the comfort of their guest, rather than on you to be forced to follow your sister around to keep the husband comfortable. They are trying to uphold those responsibilities/precautions in a strange way. And it should have been stated to you as a rule from the beginning so that you can make a better choice about visiting vs not visiting. \n\nBut hell, i may be wrong on the whole matter. It would help for more muslims to respond to tell the truth of how this issue should be dealt with in terms of their religion. My husband is the main muslim influence in my life, but i know that opinions differ.", "NTA, this isn\u2019t something most Muslim families do\u2026 at least this isn\u2019t common behaviour from Muslim families living in North America as far as I\u2019ve experienced.
