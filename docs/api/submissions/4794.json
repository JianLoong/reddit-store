Or the more unfortunate reality, her husband is a creep and she knows it. It still wants you to be a him... Yeah no", "I mean, are you napping in the same room as her husband? I assume not. \n\nMy husband is muslim. I have sisters. In the event that they are at my house napping and I for some reason have an errand to run, i wouldn\u2019t force my sisters to wake up and come with me. I trust both my husband and my sisters. If something \u201csinful\u201d were to happen, i would be upset, but ultimately that is up to God to judge their actions, not me. \n\nI realize that sisters-in-law are non-mahram for muslim men (meaning, in the event of divorce, they are still eligible for marriage to their previous sister-in-law), so there are extra responsibilities/precautions to be taken with interactions between the two that you would not take for mahram (family members NOT eligible or marriage, such a mother-in-laws, blood/milk siblings, uncles/aunts, etc.). Ensuring that non-mahram are not in the same space together ALONE is a common precaution. But that doesn\u2019t mean that existing in the same space with non-mahram is a sin, particularly if there are walled divisions. \n\nThe easiest solution would have been to suggest napping in a private room and perhaps locking the door. That should be sufficient. AND it should have been explained to you before you came to visit that this is the dynamic between muslims and non-mahram.\n\nIm not sure if your sister is untrusting of her husband or if the husband is truly super uncomfortable with being in the house alone with a non-mahram. But that is on your sister and her husband to find a solution to that doesn\u2019t impact the comfort of their guest, rather than on you to be forced to follow your sister around to keep the husband comfortable. They are trying to uphold those responsibilities/precautions in a strange way. And it should have been stated to you as a rule from the beginning so that you can make a better choice about visiting vs not visiting. \n\nBut hell, i may be wrong on the whole matter.

Their dicks shrivel up if they do any 'women's work'. Proven fact.  /s", "Lol. Only the non-fertile ones (supposedly) are safe to be around.", "The difference is that in America you're not forced to be a Christian. In the middle east it's either be Muslim, die, or leave. \n\nAnd we all see how well their equality protests are going", "I'd be pissed *I'm* not a damn vampire yet -.-", "My first draft had him actually dead and hidden in a closet - basically because he is missing from the narrative (other than as a reason not to be in the house.)", "A Van Helsing", "garlic farmers", "Oh wow - an option I had not even considered.", "Narcissist! Flying monkeys! Grey rock!", "No.  You should have said marinara flag :)", "You forgot divorce", "Ah, sorry. You are correct.", "There are so many varying degrees of religious belief, some are more strict than others. I was raised Catholic but no one was very strict about it. My great aunt was a nun and even she wasn\u2019t as strict as some people I\u2019ve seen. \n\nFor instance there was a big debate I read on a Catholic group page that was asking for advice because the woman\u2019s sister wanted to visit with her husband. The husband is not Catholic and they were not married on a Catholic Church. According to her, and mostly her husband, this means they are *not* married at all and they\u2019re living in sin. If she allowed them to stay and shared a room/sleep together it woul posted  d be enabling their sin and would then make her and her husband sinners by extension. \n\nI had never heard of anything even remotely like this in all my years of church, Sunday school, and Catechism classes but there were thousands of comments and many agreed with her. They even posted Catholic teachings that explained why it was not allowed. Some people just go really hard with the rules and interpretations.", "Oh, for sure. I also think there's a lot of things that needed to be explained and talked about and I'm wondering a lot about the situation. But it seems the rule itself was unknown so I'm just explaining the *religious* reasoning, not the sister or husband's reasons. \n\nAdditionally we don't know if maybe some of this was explained but OP was having the same confusion over sister vs sister in law and the difference in the two as viewed from a religious lens.", "Generally, your spouse's parents are your parents and their children are your children, but their siblings aren't considered mahram (close enough kin to be alone). To the husband, his wife's sister is close kin to her and not himself. So no.", "Honey. I've literally stated that his religion doesn't call for him to not be alone with his wife's sister. She would be exempt. So either they are extremist, because every other Muslim on this forum has said it's wrong if that is the reasoning, as it's not against their religion to be alone with family, which a sister in law is. Or the sister is using it as an excuse because she either doesn't trust the sister or the husband. Do you not get that? I'm saying that IF it is actually for religious reasons and not just the sister/wife making up shit, then it's because their home is extremist. Which is what the sister has stated, that the reasoning is because her husband is Muslim. Well that would mean they are an extremist households if he can't be alone with a female family member.", "Right?  I've been a little irked since seeing 'The Monster Squad in the 80s.", "Maybe there\u2019s a way to work that in? Like maybe after OP leaves the Sis shouts \u201cI\u2019m still putting wild garlic around my sister while she\u2019s sleeping and I know her blood type is your favorite flavor! Just you think about that!\u201d Before slamming the door and heading to the supermarket.", "That's pretty good too- did the wife murder him or not?  Does he become a zombie, or no?  The possibilities are endless!", "This is why the sister isn't allowed alone with him in the house!", "Oh, that's a good one too.  Wait.  So the sisters are Van Helsing decendents, but OPs sister met her husband and loved him enough to turn her back on her lineage.  OP farms garlic for a living.  Sis knows that she'll  maul him with her world-famous artisanal garlic once the truth comes to light.  And now here we are.", "Jesus at how many people use gaslighting incorrectly, too. \n\nGaslighting is a very specific type of manipulation. But people use it to describe every trick under the sun", "Boundaries\u2026", "I\u2019m genuinely curious, if she was napping in a guest room with a lock on the door would that make a difference? Especially if her sister is only going to be gone for a short time & she agrees to stay in there while she\u2019s gone.", "Found the copy and paste guy. As a Muslim woman I've never seen or heard of that happening in my community at all. If anything it's unfair on the men that Muslim women don't have to work if they don't want to as it is obligatory for men have to provide for the woman's every need financially and otherwise as well as supporting the family and his sister's and younger siblings if they're low on money or are struggling financially. That men have to pay whatever large dowry a woman wishes in order for him to marry her. That a woman can keep her own money and doesn't have to spend on her husband or family unless she wishes to.", "Or he's aware that OPs sister wasn't raised Muslim and is weaponizing his religion to get her to do things the way that he wants them done. Religious abuse is a thing and considering how nervous OPs sister is described, I wouldn't be surprised if it was the case.", "But we\u2019re not only talking about religion. We\u2019re also talking about culture. I\u2019ve been really in love twice. Both were/are Muslim. One believed in this rule about men and women. One didn\u2019t. You can\u2019t make assumptions about billions of people based off of what a handful say about themselves. Being close to them doesn\u2019t make me an expert at all, but I do know firsthand that not all people who follow a religion are identical and not everything that they believe or follow is written in a religious book.", "\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23 this whole comment section is speculation get a grip"]}
