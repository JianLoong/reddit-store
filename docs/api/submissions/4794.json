It's not up to guests in the home or random people on Reddit to dictate their rules.\n\nOnce OP was advised of the rule, she had 3 options.  1. Stay and abide.  2. Stay in a hotel.  3.  Go back home.  She chose 1.  Getting mad about it after 2 weeks and blowing up at her sister is 100% on her.", "I honestly haven't thought about that. I didn't even interact with the dude more than nods as greeting if we cross each other. I have no idea what they're like between them.", "This was my first thought too.  \n\nOP is NTA, but the sis may be in a dangerous situation.", "No. She was a guest and wasn\u2019t told the rule before arriving. This is a problem for the hosts.\n\nHusband should be the one to leave, not the guest.", "I like this! You are being very thoughtful. As a woman myself, thank you. \u263a\ufe0f It shouldn't be this way of course, but in the reality we live in...", "This is actually charming, what a refreshing thing to read. Good luck to you and yours.", "This is a good example of different cultures having different perspectives. This would be so out of the norm for me that it would have the opposite effect of making me uncomfortable instead of putting me at ease. I\u2019m glad it works for you.\n\nYour grandfather sounds like a charming man.", "Telling someone the rules for their house AFTER they get there is too late. OP accepted the invitation before she knew.", "OP was told day one of the *visit*, so she was already there. I would class that as a surprise - it wasn't mentioned at all during the planning of the visit.", "Day one of arriving, not day one of the invitation.", "Okay, THAT is a leap. With a running start.", "She was not fine. She had not alternatives! What was she supposed to say?! She tolerated them because she didn't have any other option but to do so! She was taken by surprise, too!\n\nYou tolerate a lot of bullshit when you don't know what you're getting into and if you have no place else to stay until it hits a breaking point.\n\nGuests / friends won't come back if you're acting like a nutty on a power trip.", "No she sounded like she was surprised and annoyed but accepted it because she was already there and did not plan for an unexpected hotel expense. There\u2019s a difference.", "OP was not advised she would be woken up in the middle of her sleep to abide to the rule. That's just next level rude and poor hospitality. If this was in my country and people learned you treated a guest like this you would be destroyed to the moon and back.", "I still feel sister should have told her that rule first before she came so op could make a decision based on all the information first. Not have a bomb dropped on her after she spent money and vacation time to get there. I didn\u2019t say her sister having that rule is wrong, it\u2019s her house.  Just don\u2019t agree with how she went about it.  I most likely would not make plans again with her, not knowing what last minute bomb would be set up as a hidden expectation.", "OK, that is weird.  So he doesn't even talk to you but obviously you are such a threat to their marriage that you can't be left alone with him and he is such a ??? that he isn't allowed to leave instead and pick up his own child... is he banned from the daycare?", "Welcome to it.", "Ty, kindly.\n\nTo yours, as well.", "Once OP was advised of the rule, she had 3 options. 1. Stay and abide. 2. Stay in a hotel. 3. Go back home. She chose 1. Getting mad about it after 2 weeks and blowing up at her sister is 100% on her.", "Dude we get it! Stop repeating yourself in every comment. It is absolutely reasonable to expect to be told of a hard rule you have in your home BEFORE a guest takes time off work and spends their money to visit you.", "You sound like a broken record. GTFO"]}
