So even if a muslim man feels uncomfortable with being alone with a \"stranger\" woman, he will not be uncomfortable with his SIL.

I don\u2019t see the need to judge other\u2019s religious practices generally, when all members of a family share the same beliefs, but it concerns me if religion is used to justify one of two people in a couple having no say about house rules. And if she\u2019s between a rock and a hard place, and the hard place is her own husband, that sounds like a really uncomfortable situation. You don\u2019t say if she lived in a majority Muslim country or not.

Or the more unfortunate reality, her husband is a creep and she knows it. It still wants you to be a him... Yeah no", "I mean, are you napping in the same room as her husband? I assume not. \n\nMy husband is muslim. I have sisters. In the event that they are at my house napping and I for some reason have an errand to run, i wouldn\u2019t force my sisters to wake up and come with me. I trust both my husband and my sisters. If something \u201csinful\u201d were to happen, i would be upset, but ultimately that is up to God to judge their actions, not me. \n\nI realize that sisters-in-law are non-mahram for muslim men (meaning, in the event of divorce, they are still eligible for marriage to their previous sister-in-law), so there are extra responsibilities/precautions to be taken with interactions between the two that you would not take for mahram (family members NOT eligible or marriage, such a mother-in-laws, blood/milk siblings, uncles/aunts, etc.). Ensuring that non-mahram are not in the same space together ALONE is a common precaution. But that doesn\u2019t mean that existing in the same space with non-mahram is a sin, particularly if there are walled divisions. \n\nThe easiest solution would have been to suggest napping in a private room and perhaps locking the door. That should be sufficient. AND it should have been explained to you before you came to visit that this is the dynamic between muslims and non-mahram.\n\nIm not sure if your sister is untrusting of her husband or if the husband is truly super uncomfortable with being in the house alone with a non-mahram. But that is on your sister and her husband to find a solution to that doesn\u2019t impact the comfort of their guest, rather than on you to be forced to follow your sister around to keep the husband comfortable. They are trying to uphold those responsibilities/precautions in a strange way. And it should have been stated to you as a rule from the beginning so that you can make a better choice about visiting vs not visiting. \n\nBut hell, i may be wrong on the whole matter. It would help for more muslims to respond to tell the truth of how this issue should be dealt with in terms of their religion. My husband is the main muslim influence in my life, but i know that opinions differ.", "NTA, this isn\u2019t something most Muslim families do\u2026 at least this isn\u2019t common behaviour from Muslim families living in North America as far as I\u2019ve experienced.

If your BIL has a brother, that brother and your sister shouldn\u2019t be joking around too much, stay in the same room together when her hubby isn\u2019t there and she has to cover herself in front of him. \n\nPeople always question the concept of hijab.

But a MIL can\u2019t show her hair to her son in law. Similarly, it is highly recommended to stay away from SIL and BIL (if you\u2019re the opp sex). To all the people saying \u201cis she not family?\u201d Technically no. \n\nHijab is to cover in front of non mehram. Your family is divided into mehram and non mehram categories. A mehram is someone who CANNOT marry. Like your brother, father and uncles. If something happened to your sister, technically you fall into the category of women he can pursue (if you both wanted). \n\nAlso, the husband should be following similar rules when his female cousins come over. \n\nTo all the Muslims telling OP that they leave their spouses alone with their sister/ brother. Shame on you for misleading OP from knowing the truth. This is a principle/ condition of hijab and modesty. Just because you do not practice it, doesn\u2019t mean the principle doesn\u2019t exist. You cannot travel, sit next to (body to body), be emotionally/ physically involved with or be alone with a non mehram. \n\nHOWEVER, your sisters initial approach in keeping it low is weird.

The same general idea is there, but practices and specifics vary widely. We would need to know what form of Islam this husband follows, how traditional he is, and where is is from.

Seems a miscommunication on her part. Or have these things been mentioned (especially if she's converted/during the regular course of her marriage even if she's not a convert) and OP missed important pieces of info? Or never realized the importance of certain things mentioned? \n\nOnce OP arrived and the rules were explained, she mentions that husband was rarely seen but she was brought out on errands often by her sister. Why? Is he home? Is he coming home soon? If he is home, why is he home so much but rarely seen? Is he just sitting in a back bedroom while OP and her sister visit/walk around the house or is OP not leaving her room enough to see husband walking around? If he considers her not close enough to be in the house alone with her, why is she even staying there? \n\nBesides all that, when OP becomes loud, why does sister say she doesn't want husband to hear (is this a nefarious sign of sister being afraid of husband)? If he explained the rule, shouldn't he know about it already? If he's not the one enforcing it, why is sister doing so (does she not trust either husband or OP)? Was the rule and subsequent requirements to the rule explained to OP thoroughly enough to be understood, and OP simply didn't understand how closely this rule was to be followed (or was it an offhand mention)? \n\nBack to the husband rarely being seen and OP being brought along on errands so much, and sister going to fetch their child - is husband lazy? Does he enforce rules on his house with an iron fist? Or, alternatively, does he work from home and therefore can't leave? Does he work night shift and therefore is home sleeping often during the day? Both could be reasons for him to both need to be home during the day, be unavailable for errand running with his wife, and could be why OP was shushed (so as not to disturb either work or sleep). Is there another reason entirely that he doesn't leave home easily? \n\nI can think of a lot of reasons why the issue is with husband, or sister, or OP tbh.

Interestingly enough, I found this:\n\n\"If a vampire was a Muslim in his or her mortal life, would they still fear the cross or would they fear the crescent moon instead?\n\n'The crescent moon is not really the same kind of symbol as the cross. The cross is a reminder of what Christians believe is the most significant event in Mankind\u2019s history\u2014the death and resurrection of Jesus, and the alleged salvation of all mankind. Not a minor thing.\n\nMuslims worship the same God\u2014the one Christians call the Father\u2014but they believe Jesus was not God, but a Prophet who was allowed to perform ,miracles through God\u2019s command, mush as Moses and Elijah and more prophets did. The Crescent was a common motif in the Ottoman Empire, and so is recognized as a symbol of the Islamic sphere of interest more than it is a symbol of any particular revered truth\u2014well, maybe that our Holy times are charted using a lunar calendar.\n\nSo a crescent wouldn\u2019t scare a vampire any more than the flag of Vatican City would.\n\nWhat would frighten a vampire?\n\nA copy of the Qur\u2019an.\n\nOne of the names of God written in Arabic.\n\nA verse from the Qur\u2019an recited in the appropriate style.' \"\n\nThere you go.
