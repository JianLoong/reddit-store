And it is so much more fiscally responsible to be doing it the way that you are. I remember the 2008 recession that seemingly hit put of absolutely nowhere and how your job can be essentially gone so fast.

Kids absolutely don\u2019t owe their parents anything for providing the basic necessities. Anything they provided above that they did so willingly because that\u2019s what parents do. Your father should be taking your mother on vacations, out for meals and to buy new clothes. You owe her none of that. Financially, you are doing wonderfully. And you need to continue doing exactly what you are doing. You should be saving as much money as possible, planning for your future and retirement. You need to have money saved in case something happens to your job or your health. At some point you may find a partner and want to get married and have a honeymoon. All of that\u2019s going to be on you. Tell your mother if you get lucky and win a multi million dollar lottery, you will be happy to send her on vacation but until then she can get a job and pay for her own.", "NTA. The fact that she just decided that you were going to spend your income on her once you started working is wild to me, but to complain above and beyond that because you aren't giving her everything she wants is insane. You're 100% right, your parents are the ones who decided to have children and took on the responsibility of caring for you, that doesn't entitle them to access to your income as an adult. Your mother is the one being ungrateful and selfish.", "Did you grow up in the US?\n\nI get that is some cultures, children are expected to be responsible for their parents in their old age.\n\nI also think what you have stated, being debt free, is a sound strategic idea.\n\nIf and when you are able to treat you parents, you should not take on loads for their vacations, luxuries.\n\nNTA", "I\u2019m seeing this a lot more parents are starting to become more entitled", "NTA, you're not selfish for being responsible with your money. You're being kind enough by taking your mother out to eat when you visit.", "NTA and I've never understood the idea that some parents have that giving birth to a child means they're expected to pay you back as you get older. It's nice if you want to treat your parents occasionally but it is not an obligation no matter how much your parents whine.", "NTA - you did not choose to be born, they made that decision. Please stop spending money on your mom when she cries about it. Get her nice gifts for the holidays and birthdays but that\u2019s it. \n\nYou do not owe her anything. Just because she had this false reality where you would take care of her in the future does not mean you have to. It\u2019s like she wanted to have a kid to take her out when they start making money but it never has been or will be your job to take her out. You need to start saying no. You might want a family in the future or travel with a SO, not your mom. She does not I deserve a penny from you.", "NTA, good parents encourage their children to move forward. They don't try to keep their kids back by demanding vacations and money. This is how younger generations end up living paycheck to paycheck even when they make good money. \n\nKeep paying your debt and saving so that you can live the life you want. Don't go into debt for her vacations.", "If mom wants those things, tell her to get a fucking job like you did.", "I find this post rather odd tbh.

It's not your responsibility to do any of these things", "NTA. Mom is an entitled AH if she thinks that your major responsibility is her.  How old are your parents? Birthing you was something she Chose to do. She owed You basic necessities and shouldn\u2019t be the reason why you owe her anything now.\nYou live on your own. Might I suggest you go LC with her? Sounds like you are financially responsible and parents are not. Don\u2019t let her gaslight you.", "NTA, I hate it when parents use that line, you owe me your life if it wasn\u2019t for me you wouldn\u2019t have XYZ, you need to look after me now that I\u2019m old because I looked after you for 18 years. My husband and I decided when we got married that we wouldn\u2019t take in either set of parents when they got old and made it quite clear to all involved that we would make sure they were looked after and in a good home if they couldn\u2019t look after themselves but that it wouldn\u2019t be in our house, my BIL told us we were selfish and that we owed it to our parents I looked right in eyes and told him he could take them in then because it wouldn\u2019t be me, what we owed our parents now was to raise their grandchildren and to pass on what our parents taught us. I told my kids while they were growing up and now that they are adults that I don\u2019t want them to ever ever feel the need to look after us.", "My dad is retired now and doesn't have funds to do any of it.

I think all this owing your parents says is bullshit. \n\nWhen you decided to have children you decided to provide for them, in your own ways.

In this case, since mom is one of the narcissists, I think he'd be fine posting this story as-is.", "Absolutely. The mom is nuts.", "NTA.  You don't owe your parents vacations for having and raising you.  You need to provide for yourself and make a living etc. you can't be gifting parents international vacations.

Good parents get repaid by having nice caring kids who would do stuff out of desire. not demands. A child doesn\u2019t ask to be born and raising the child and providing for it are the basics of being a parent when you decide to have a kid so no child owes their parents for that.", "NTA.  Cribbing???", "NAH.  Your mom is being selfish.  She thinks that YOUR salary should go for what she wants.\n\nYou can't afford to take her to Europe, and she's being immature by not realizing this.\n\nAlso, your parents' job is to raise you, and not vice versa.", "NTA in the first place.\n\nYour mother sounds selfish, really! And you don\u2019t owe them anything.\n\nBut I live now long enough, that I can tell you, that your mother is absolutely proud of you. Because normal parents would normally not demand for these things, they would ask once and accepted your answer/doing.\n\nShe does this, so she can brag to her family/friends about her \u201ecaring\u201c and \u201eloving\u201c and \u201esuccessful\u201c kid.\n\nBut here is the thing. \u201eNormal\u201c parents!

Beyond that, and not that it is my business what you do for a living, but it doesn\u2019t seem to involve using proper grammar or speaking eloquently.", "NTA. Like you said, they did the basics that are their responsibility as parents. Your responsibility now is to make your life what you want it to be. It\u2019s okay to give them gifts *when you want to*, but do t let them guilt you into luxury purchases. Get yourself set up well financially first. If a spouse and children of your own are what you want, you\u2019re u will need savings to be able to care for your own family in case of emergency such as job loss, major illness, etc.", "Does Mom work?

I hate people who try to breed slaves.", "I hate entitled parents who think you \u201cowe\u201d  them a nice lifestyle just because they gave birth to you.

But stop visiting and stop paying for her.", "I wanna know how much she payed for your education and how much you make to decide.", "Parent child relationship is not supposed to be transactional, if your child has had an education and is out on their own earning their own keep, congratulations you did your job.

Vacations, gifts, etc. so with context **that\u2019s how I was raised to believe things should be, and do but there\u2019s a big IF here. As a whole no, you don\u2019t owe your parents for doing what\u2019s legally required or them to do. They also likely didn\u2019t really do it for you, so much as: they would\u2019ve been charged with neglect had they not**. I\u2019d give my dad my last dollar, but not because he\u2019d ask or because he housed me, fed me, and bought me things on occasion.\n\n**I\u2019d do it, and do because he is a above and beyond human being. Same with him and my grandmother. The amount of overwhelming love that radiates off them is insane, they\u2019d also never dare ask a dime. They\u2019d rather struggle so long as their children did well in life, and mean it.** My dad gives my grandma the world because she is a gem of a human who has always put herself last and loves her children despite their many mistakes and always supported them emotionally. My dads the same that\u2019s why I feel he deserves the world. Parents aren\u2019t owed anything for being parents or for doing the basics and not being the worst human. \n\n**It\u2019s the child\u2019s decision to do so depending on:**\n\n**A) if it\u2019s financially feasible and/or**\n\n**B) if they feel the need to, not because they\u2019re told but because their heart says so. That\u2019s also not a dig at you, it\u2019s a dig at her. Because if she\u2019d been the parent to you that I had, she both wouldn\u2019t be demanding shit and you\u2019d want to with every fiber in your being.** I\u2019m not saying they\u2019re bad people, they could be but that\u2019s not the point. They never went above and beyond even just emotionally to where you\u2019d feel the need. My birth moms actually a lot like yours, she\u2019s not actively in my life and I also don\u2019t do much for her outside or holidays because I don\u2019t find it warranted.\n\nParents, not birth moms and dads. **PARENTS will suffer, go hungry, and die for their children so long as they\u2019re truly happy, loved, safe, protected, comfortable, cared for, etc. They think about their children first and themselves last, and it NEVER stops no matter the age**. My grandma struggles so badly with that my dad even helps her with bills let alone luxuries. My dad has it, it doesn\u2019t affect him but she\u2019d rather he use it than her. **That\u2019s the selflessness of a parent. That she was making demands from day one speaks volumes. She\u2019s selfish and entitled.** \n\nI don\u2019t know much about your dad, but from what I read my guess is he\u2019d rather put pressure on you and emotionally manipulate you than deal with your mothers complaints that he can\u2019t or wont. **If your parent feels like you owe them for being your parents, both their heart and head isn\u2019t in the right place. Now I\u2019m not saying let them end up on the streets, but you\u2019re right that you don\u2019t owe them a damn thing.
