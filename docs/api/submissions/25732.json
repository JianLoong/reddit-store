But it's funny that you don't mention your dad until the very end. Why isn't HE taking her on vacations, being a responsible, caring and respectful husband by making his wife happy?????", "NTA.\n\nYou DON'T owe your parents anything. She had you, not the other way around. It was her responsibility to take care of herself and you, not the other way around. \n\nYou are not obligated to pay for things in your mom's life. And for her to act like she is because you want to be more responsible is not OK.", "NTA and you are 100% right.\n\nYour parents are narcissists.  Stop taking her out to fancy meals.  Stop buying her clothes.    \nIf relaxing at your home and having a home-cooked meal isn't good enough for her, then she can't come over.\n\nPlease check out [https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/](https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/)  It's not just for MIL.

She would drain you if you let her.", "NTA and it is so refreshing to see someone actually tell their entitled parents that.", "NTA, You have to take care of yourself first. And it is so much more fiscally responsible to be doing it the way that you are. I remember the 2008 recession that seemingly hit put of absolutely nowhere and how your job can be essentially gone so fast. If you pay off your debts first, you are so much less likely to have to take on a huge debt burden just to keep your stuff. It's not like you are patently refusing, so set the boundary and enforce it. You will take them to wherever it is they so desperately want to go eventually.", "NTA\r  \n\r  \nTime to set boundaries and stick to them. Otherwise, it will be a long life with the same shit.", "NTA- Kids do not owe their parents anything, ever.  \n\nFrom a parent's prospective, I chose to have my kids.  With that choice came the responsibility of caring for them.  All I want from my kids is for them to live the best lives they can.  I will do what I can to make that happen.", "NTA. What your parents did for you growing up was part of the deal when they had a child. If they had children figuring that they would cash in on them one day, then it's not your fault that their plan failed.", "Absolutely NTA. People who choose to be parents sign up to take care of their children and provide for them. If your mom wants to travel then she needs to save up herself. You don\u2019t owe her anything and what you said to her was in no way ungrateful. Congrats on working towards financial success!", "NTA. Tell her you didn't ask to be born. She had you so it was her responsibility.  Tell her that if she keeps being entitled you won't visit anymore.", "It was mildly rude, but she needed some pushback. I don't know how much they sacrificed to raise you and get you through school, but if it was painful, I can see her point. NAH. It might be tactful to take on some debt for a one-time thank you, but you don't want to become her ATM.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Kids absolutely don\u2019t owe their parents anything for providing the basic necessities. Anything they provided above that they did so willingly because that\u2019s what parents do. Your father should be taking your mother on vacations, out for meals and to buy new clothes. You owe her none of that. Financially, you are doing wonderfully. And you need to continue doing exactly what you are doing. You should be saving as much money as possible, planning for your future and retirement. You need to have money saved in case something happens to your job or your health. At some point you may find a partner and want to get married and have a honeymoon. All of that\u2019s going to be on you. Tell your mother if you get lucky and win a multi million dollar lottery, you will be happy to send her on vacation but until then she can get a job and pay for her own.", "NTA. The fact that she just decided that you were going to spend your income on her once you started working is wild to me, but to complain above and beyond that because you aren't giving her everything she wants is insane. You're 100% right, your parents are the ones who decided to have children and took on the responsibility of caring for you, that doesn't entitle them to access to your income as an adult. Your mother is the one being ungrateful and selfish.", "Did you grow up in the US?\n\nI get that is some cultures, children are expected to be responsible for their parents in their old age.\n\nI also think what you have stated, being debt free, is a sound strategic idea.\n\nIf and when you are able to treat you parents, you should not take on loads for their vacations, luxuries.\n\nNTA", "I\u2019m seeing this a lot more parents are starting to become more entitled", "NTA, you're not selfish for being responsible with your money. You're being kind enough by taking your mother out to eat when you visit.", "NTA and I've never understood the idea that some parents have that giving birth to a child means they're expected to pay you back as you get older. It's nice if you want to treat your parents occasionally but it is not an obligation no matter how much your parents whine.", "NTA - you did not choose to be born, they made that decision. Please stop spending money on your mom when she cries about it. Get her nice gifts for the holidays and birthdays but that\u2019s it. \n\nYou do not owe her anything. Just because she had this false reality where you would take care of her in the future does not mean you have to. It\u2019s like she wanted to have a kid to take her out when they start making money but it never has been or will be your job to take her out. You need to start saying no. You might want a family in the future or travel with a SO, not your mom. She does not I deserve a penny from you.", "NTA, good parents encourage their children to move forward. They don't try to keep their kids back by demanding vacations and money. This is how younger generations end up living paycheck to paycheck even when they make good money. \n\nKeep paying your debt and saving so that you can live the life you want. Don't go into debt for her vacations.", "If mom wants those things, tell her to get a fucking job like you did.", "I find this post rather odd tbh. Out of curiosity, did you ask your parents to pay for your post secondary education (rather than take loans) and agree to certain things in exchange after you were employed?", "Did your mom send her parents on vacations? This seems so nuts to me.", "NTA your parents provided for you because that is what they had to do once they chose to have children. You are not obligated to take them on fancy vacations now.", "There's a lesson here. She pissed away Dad's money on clothes to the point that vacations were/ are impossible. Don't be like mom and dad.\n\nNTA", "Oh my god, just imagine the shit your poor father has become accustomed to over the past decades. \nI would bet money that she has pulled this shit on him for the entirety of your life.", "You're not the parent. It's not your responsibility to do any of these things", "NTA. Mom is an entitled AH if she thinks that your major responsibility is her.  How old are your parents? Birthing you was something she Chose to do. She owed You basic necessities and shouldn\u2019t be the reason why you owe her anything now.\nYou live on your own. Might I suggest you go LC with her? Sounds like you are financially responsible and parents are not. Don\u2019t let her gaslight you.", "NTA, I hate it when parents use that line, you owe me your life if it wasn\u2019t for me you wouldn\u2019t have XYZ, you need to look after me now that I\u2019m old because I looked after you for 18 years. My husband and I decided when we got married that we wouldn\u2019t take in either set of parents when they got old and made it quite clear to all involved that we would make sure they were looked after and in a good home if they couldn\u2019t look after themselves but that it wouldn\u2019t be in our house, my BIL told us we were selfish and that we owed it to our parents I looked right in eyes and told him he could take them in then because it wouldn\u2019t be me, what we owed our parents now was to raise their grandchildren and to pass on what our parents taught us. I told my kids while they were growing up and now that they are adults that I don\u2019t want them to ever ever feel the need to look after us.", "My dad is retired now and doesn't have funds to do any of it. They have enough to live, not for luxuries like vacation. And she has enough clothes, just wants new ones. He doesn't want to waste money on that.", "Correction, it\u2019s only for Mils and moms. Fil and dads have a separate sub. And there is a family one.", "It\u2019s their choice to have a child, they had the responsibility of looking after her. She didn\u2019t cost to be their daughter but they chose to have her. I think all this owing your parents says is bullshit. \n\nWhen you decided to have children you decided to provide for them, in your own ways. Children are not retirement plans, children are not your little robots that should do as they are told (not when they are grown up and have their own mind/values/choices.\n\nIf they want to travel then plan and work/invest. If they really wanted to travel maybe don\u2019t have a kid, work and invest in a travel agent instead. \n\nThere is a different between the kids wanting to spoil their parents vs they are expected to", "You are not the parent.  You don\u2019t owe them anything. Certainly not vacations!   Maybe lessen the contact you have with them.  And don\u2019t tell them your financial situation.  It\u2019s none of their business.  NTA.  Shit them down.", "Meh.\n\nThe advice I have read there can be applied to any pushy relatives, but I'm sure the OP will find good advice in the ones you've mentioned as well.", "Oh finding advice. It\u2019s just the posting is strictly mil and mom. If it\u2019s other relatives-heavy they delete the posts", "I follow you.  In this case, since mom is one of the narcissists, I think he'd be fine posting this story as-is.", "Absolutely. The mom is nuts."]}
