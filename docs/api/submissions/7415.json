You have the right to hang your art wherever you want, but it shouldn't surprise you to know that many people are not comfortable with nudity (and that ignores the fact that it was your mother, reacting to your nudity - honestly not sure how you expected that to end), and it is your responsibility as host to make sure your guests are comfortable. That could be as simple as warning your guests before they arrive, or something more like moving the more risque pieces, either to a bedroom or maybe even set up a gallery room for them.

Your home, your rules. \n\nHowever, people can be uncomfortable and not visit like your mom. \n\nIt may be uncomfortable for some of your guests who wouldn\u2019t expect to see their host, whom they are having dinner with or tea, this way. Normally people have other paintings or photos of other people they don\u2019t know tastefully nude, not the host. \nAlso, they may not want children exposed to it necessarily.

Said kindly . . . one person's \"tastefully artsy nude picture\" is another's \"personal kink on display\", and it can be difficult to differentiate. And the fact that you - the host/homeowner - are the subject, makes this trickier, because honestly, it gives exhibitionist vibes. And TBH, your whole faux-innocent \"am I just completely unaware of societal  norms regarding hanging naked photographs of myself in the public areas of my home because *my husband is an artiste*\" thing rings deeply cringy and disingenuous. You're an adult. I'm not sure why what your husband does for a living would interfere with you being aware of the world around you. Do you not have friends? Family? Do you exist entirely outside of the society in which you've been living for the last quarter-century? \n\nI don't believe that you don't know and understand societal standards. I believe that you don't WANT to, but that you don't want to be accused of narcissism or exhibitionism and this fake innocent \"my husband is an artist and I just didn't KNOW that some people might be uncomfortable\" is your way of dodging that. It reads deeply insincere.\n\nYes, people hang pictures of themselves in their homes . . . but normally they are family pictures, small portraits, etc., not meant to draw excessive attention. When people hang huge paintings of themselves, naked photos, etc., it tends to imply a certain need for attention. And the argument that we see naked artwork in museums is completely disingenuous as well. First of all, a home is not a museum. But also, outside of modern art museums, most naked artwork in museums is representational . . . not literal naked photos of people we know, or **the person who is sitting across from us at tea**. \n\nTo be clear, I'm not going to tell you you're an AH. What you do in your home is absolutely your business. But hanging a triptych of naked photos of yourself - particularly if your face is showing and it is clear that you are the subject - absolutely comes across as exhibitionism at best, and at worst, people may feel deeply uncomfortable, as though they are being made part of a kink they did not consent to (and yes, this applies even if the photos aren't explicitly sexual; people are allowed to not consent to participating in your desire to \"put yourself on display\" in the most literal sense).\n\nHang the photos, but do so somewhere private. People CHOOSE to go see museum exhibits. No one wants to see you naked without advance warning on their way to the loo at your house. It's up to you, but it's distasteful.

No. Art is art.\n\nThat said, if the photos include your face or are otherwise identifiably pictures of you, that's likely to change people's perception of the pieces, because it will occur to them that they are seeing you naked.
