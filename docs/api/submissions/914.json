I'm obviously not proud of her for being a teen mother, but I am **extremely** proud of her for how she is handling everything. She is an amazing mother and she is still doing very well at school. She is dating Owen's father, Raymond (17M), who is a lovely kid too. They all live with me in my home and I provide for them financially with some support from Raymond's family. I'm a lawyer and I am lucky enough to be able to work from home most of the time so I care for my grandson during the day while Raymond and Amelia are at school. When I have to go into work, Raymond's family looks after Owen. \n\nRecently, my sister called and asked me if I could allow her daughter, Stephanie (19F), to move in with me. It's difficult to find a place to live in our city, so I agreed to let her move in for free. I'm very big on family taking care of eachother so I didn't want to charge my sister's daughter rent. \n\n\nI immediately noticed that Stephanie was being weird about Amelia being a teen mother. She'd make tasteless jokes and I immediately took her aside and told that I wouldn't tolerate any sort of teasing. I've hired a tutor for both Amelia and Raymond just for extra support and when Stephanie found out, she rolled her eyes and said 'they wouldn't need one I'd they had just been responsible'. She also said that I was 'rewarding bad behaviour' but I told her that I liked to take care of my family, just as how I allowed her to move in for free.\n\nThen, I realized that Stephanie was taking some of Amelia's clothing without permission. When she first moved in, I told her that in my home, we ask for permission before take other people's belongings so I was pretty annoyed at it. Amelia asked Stephanie to return a shirt that she had taken and she refused and said that Amelia didn't need it back because she didn't fit into it. Amelia did gain weight as a result of pregnancy and breastfeeding and it's made her very insecure. It was a shirt she wore pre-baby and she keeps it so she can use it to motivate herself to lose weight. I told Stephanie to return it immediately and apologize but she refused. We got into a massive argument that resulted in me packing her bags and calling her mother to come and get her. \n\nEveryone in the family is bombarding me with phonecalls calling me TAH for kicking her out.

How is that teaching a teen parent anybresponsibility? They should atleast be made to each have a part time job so one can watch the kid while the other works so they can learn that children are expensive and hard and take a lot of care. I get she is doing what she thinks best to give her daughter the best future, but she's taking away everything that teaches them how hard having kids really is. I mean if the kids don't have to struggle at all they are going to wind up popping out another kid because they think it's so easy.", "I feel like the only people who could ask that question was their parents", "so like i said op the entire time op is the one raising the kid, paying for the kid etc? yea how responsible these kids are for making others take care of their child", "Them having jobs isn\u2019t gonna teach them how hard having a child is. They would spend less time with the child that way. It would just show how expensive life is.", "Because they are still in school. You can't get a job without an education. Would you just toss them to the curb and say good luck, you made a mistake now you and your family will suffer for years and years. That should teach them.", "They are high school age. And both of them getting not only diplomas but also degrees is much more likely to lead to financial independence.", "They\u2019re clearly not forcing OP to do this though, seems like she willingly wants to help since she even willingly let the niece live with them rent free. Sounds like OP is just an amazing helpful person and also like  I said, OP is not caring for the kid the entire time, the parents probably do on the weekends and after school plus Raymond\u2019s family helps as well. OP probably does most of the time but not the entire time.", "How is it so different than adult parents who both work sending their baby to daycare? Smh man", "So your solution on helping them learn to parent is essentially taking away all of the tough things related to parenting? Maybe her kid is going to thrive from this and be the greatest mother ever.  I just think there's a fine line between help and doing so much that your child thinks being a parent is easy.", "I think op is doing the best to help them succeed and hopefully not be financially dependent on her later in life. \n\nI feel like tough love/letting them sink or swim is not gonna give them the best chance at succeeding.\n\nAlso going to work is easier than being home with a child."]}
