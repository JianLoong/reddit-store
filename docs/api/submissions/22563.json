My parents informed us that they want to split it five ways, my sister gets 2/5 while the three of us brothers get 1/5 each. Their reasoning is that my sister \"sacrificed\" her childhood for our family so its only fair she gets compensated.\n\nIn our childhood, my father's business partner screwed him over so there was a period where we were broke and in debt. My parents had to work multiple jobs to keep us afloat, and my sister babysat us while our parents worked. All she had to do was feed us and keep an eye on us. We were pretty calm kids so all we did was play games and do our homework. It probably wasn't thrilling, but not exactly a tremendous hardship. \n\nI complained to my parents along with my brothers that its insane they want to give my sister 2/5 of the inheritance over that, especially since she's financially the best off out of all of us. She doesn't have any kids and a dual income with her partner. \n\nMy parents said they're disappointed in us, and said we need to reflect on ourselves. My sister didn't say shit while my parents spoke, but texted us afterwards that she had zero intention of taking 2/5 but we were all assholes.\n\nAITA for feeling like this split is unfair?", "created_utc": 1689683447, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/152x6q5/aita_for_not_wanting_to_give_my_wealthier_sister/", "score": 7088, "replies": ["YTA - \u2018all she had to do was feed us and keep an eye on us\u2019   \nWTF ?  \nThat\u2019s what parents are supposed to do NOT a sibling.  \nShe did sacrifice her childhood for you !   \nIt\u2019s amazing that even tho she spent all that time caring for her ungrateful siblings she still did well for herself.  \nHas it occurred to you that she doesn\u2019t have kids because she already raised you and your brothers ?", "YTA. Not many parents are willing to acknowledge that they parentified a child. Your sister sacrificed her teenage years to help your parents take care of you. There may not have been any inheritance at all for you to quibble over, if not for her unpaid labor back then.", "YTA. It sounds like your parents have an inheritance to give in large part because of your sister supporting them, which allowed them to get out of a financial hole.\n\nIt was respectful of our parents to explain their choice; they could have left it without any explanation and that is their right.\n\nAlso, you\u2019re ten years younger, you have no idea what it was like for your sister. You assume you were easy, but you seem pretty entitled now so I\u2019m guessing you were harder than you knew. She helped parent you, full stop.", "Yep, YTA. First of all, you are not entitled to any of your parents' money, they could have left it to a cat shelter and that would have been fine. Second, yes, she did in fact make a huge sacrifice by basically becoming a third parent and babysitting you all the time. All the time you've spent playing? She could have been out with her friends, enjoying her childhood, and instead she was making sure her siblings were fed and out of trouble. You are terribly entitled.", "YTA. Even if she just stayed at home while you were there,  she didn't have teenage freedom and she made sacrifices and took on responsibilities. It doesn't matter how affluent she is now, your parents are trying to pay her back for what they couldn't pay her then.", "Unfair how? You are getting free a money/assets for nothing, your parents decided your sister deserves a large portion based on what she did for the family, clearly you weren\u2019t raised to respect your parents decisions", "YTA (Along with your brothers) You should respect your parents decision and be grateful they are giving you guys anything.", "Fucking hell, you're getting 20% of the inheritance instead of 25%. You're not angry that you're getting less, just that she's getting more. And she fucking raised you. Then you claim that looking after 3 kids alone when you're a teenager is the same as not getting lifts to friends' houses. Apparently raising kids is nothing, but they should get all the money. And to top it all off, she was on your side until you were such a bellend about it. I really hope your parents do adjust the will, it's only going 1 way if so. \n\nOh, and YTA.", "YTA - an entitled AH. Your parents owe you no inheritance and can do with it whatever they want. You should be grateful you are getting 1/5! Did you even say thank you? \n\nEveryone makes their own choices in life - having kids, studying and what type of employment. You should be doing everything you can to provide for your own family and not expecting a hand out. \n\nIt\u2019s lovely that your parents acknowledge your sisters sacrifices and loss of childhood. Your parents and sister seem like great people.", "YTA. Your sister cared for you at the expense of her childhood and teenage years while you were children, and this is how you show your appreciation?\n\n> All she had to do was feed us and keep an eye on us\n\nThat\u2019s still taking care of 3 kids while being a child herself. \n\nShe didn\u2019t get to have a normal childhood to make sure you and your brothers didn\u2019t go hungry or hurt yourself. The least your parents can do now is compensate her for her time and effort. You\u2019re being greedy.

The entitlement, smh!", "\"All she had to do was feed us and keep an eye on us.\" So no after school clubs, no seeing her friends, no going out. \n\nYTA, This would have had a huge effect on her life. I also have to wonder if she doesn't have kids because she'd already raised you three, this happens to a lot of poeple who had to care for their siblings.", "YTA.

Not because you sound entitled, I think most kids would question why they were getting less than another sibling if they\u2019re already better off. However, your parents have clearly explained that they relied on your sister to do a lot of the parenting when you were younger. This may not be the same memory you have but you were a kid and you won\u2019t remember it like older people would\u2019ve. If I asked my adult daughter if she thought she was an easy child to look after when she was younger, she\u2019d undoubtedly say of course she was. News flash, she was a lot of hard work for a very long time and if she\u2019d had an older sibling who\u2019d stepped up to help out, I\u2019d want to recognise that in some way too.

They\u2019re doing right by giving her what she deserves. You have no idea what your sister went through, and you are not entitled to any inheritance. You should be thanking your parents for giving you anything at all.", "YTA. They could give you absolutely nothing at all, leave it to charity or even to other relatives. You are acting like a spoilt brat and hopefully, all these comments are a wake up call.", "as the eldest sibling, i assure you being the defacto backup parent takes its toll on you even if your siblings are chill. you're devaluing her and what she did for you and your parents, and that's unfair. i think your parents logic is sound enough and honestly something you would not see from most parents who genuinely do not unerstand the impact that has on the eldest kid, and your sister is absolutely right that yta", "I'm the eldest of three, I had to babysit my two younger siblings all the time, my parents both had two jobs.  You'll never be aware of how much your sister sacrificed, fine she may have just 'fed and watched' you, but she gave up an awful lot, teenage years are the most formative, the fact that she spent her free time watching you three could be the reason she hasn't got kids.  Personally if my parents sat me down and talked about their will, I'd be too upset to think about how much I'm going to get my hands on.  I hope she takes 2/5.

It\u2019s all about what you\u2019re getting out of it.\n\nYour parents are able to provide an inheritance for you today because your sister had to give up her childhood. While you think it was easy for her somehow to just only feed you because apparently you were \u201ccalm\u201d kids means absolutely nothing. I don\u2019t know if you\u2019re being purposely na\u00efve or just ignorant to how stressful it is to take care of children when you are a child yourself. I have a feeling your sister was protecting you from knowing how hard things was for her. As the first born having that kind of responsibility isn\u2019t a damm cakewalk, yet you don\u2019t even seem appreciative of the sacrifices everyone else made for your well-being. \n\nRegardless of your entitlement to money that isn\u2019t yours. At the end of the day, it is your parents money, so their decision. You don\u2019t really have the right to dictate anything. Maybe it would do you some good to do some self reflection. Truly, your sister deserves better siblings.", "Wow good on your parents, it's rare to see parents acknowledge the burden their kid carried in a situation like that, especially when the kid is a girl. Your parents and your sister sound great.\n\nYou on the other hand are being kind of an entitled ass. It's not your money, you're not entitled to an inheritance at all, let alone to dictate how it's split. \n\nAlso, if your sister hadn't been there taking care of you your parents wouldn't have been able to do the work that got them in this financial position. The money you're so mad about not inheriting enough of? That money wouldn't be there if not for your sister. If you can't bring yourself to appreciate her sacrifice then look at it as an investment, she contributed to your parents' income and now they're paying her back on the investment. Still unfair?\n\nYTA", "YTA. The cat comes out the bag, all you care about is money.", "With attitudes like that, I hope your parents spend their money and enjoy their twilight years without trying to penny pinch so a bunch of ungrateful brats can argue over an inheritance they aren't actually owed.\n\nInheritance is a privilege.

It's rare for parents to acknowledge the parentification of any kind. And if they are, then your parents are on the right path to amend things, OP.

That's not your money and you have no right to bitch about what you inherit you entitled shitheads.", "YTA\n\nYour parents don't have to leave you anything at all and looking after 3 children for years will definitely have taken a lot of your sister's time away from hobbies and friends.\n\nI think this agreement seem quite fair actually. Me and both my siblings are in our early 30ies as well and sat down with our parents, due to circumstances not everything will be equal, my parents are giving some money/land to my siblings now as they are both building houses, I understood their reasoning.\n\nAlso, your sister is 10 years older than you, it stands to reason that she had some time to build her savings.\n\nYour parents are still alive, they may well spend/need their savings in the future.", "YTA - hey appropriate username as you are indeed bitter!  Your parents can split their money as they want, they can even decide to give you nothing, you don\u2019t get a say in the matter. \n\nYour sister did sacrifice her childhood to help your parents and you are reaping the benefits now. You think your parents would have had any money to leave you if she didn\u2019t help out back then? Regardless of if you think it was hard it meant she couldn\u2019t go out with friends, couldn\u2019t do any extracurricular activities, didn\u2019t have the freedom teenagers have.

You don't know whether she would've rather been out visiting her friends, or doing extra-curricular activities instead of looking after you, even if it was less work than you imagine it was. The responsibility alone justifies it, in my opinion.\n\nIf I were your parents, I would give you 3 nothing and your eldest sister everything if this is the nasty reaction I saw.\n\nAlso, why have kids if you can't afford them? That's hardly your sister's fault.

My parents informed us that they want to split it five ways, my sister gets 2/5 while the three of us brothers get 1/5 each. Their reasoning is that my sister \"sacrificed\" her childhood for our family so its only fair she gets compensated.\n\nIn our childhood, my father's business partner screwed him over so there was a period where we were broke and in debt. My parents had to work multiple jobs to keep us afloat, and my sister babysat us while our parents worked. All she had to do was feed us and keep an eye on us. We were pretty calm kids so all we did was play games and do our homework. It probably wasn't thrilling, but not exactly a tremendous hardship. \n\nI complained to my parents along with my brothers that its insane they want to give my sister 2/5 of the inheritance over that, especially since she's financially the best off out of all of us. She doesn't have any kids and a dual income with her partner. \n\nMy parents said they're disappointed in us, and said we need to reflect on ourselves. My sister didn't say shit while my parents spoke, but texted us afterwards that she had zero intention of taking 2/5 but we were all assholes.\n\nAITA for feeling like this split is unfair?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

The fact that they want to recognize this sacrifice is important to them and important to your sister--and you chose to take a huge dump on that because she is better off now.\n\nWhile it is responsible to explain your trust and will with the benefactors, this post is why a lot do not do it.  My Grandparents left a surprise in their will for my dad and my uncle--10% to me.  The reason?  of the 10 or so grandchildren, I was the only one to travel to see them on a regular basis.

Think of people in impoverished nations, where children need to work, beg for money, sort through trash to find food. Historically, children have been part of the working family unit.

That says a lot about his involvement with his own kids if he has any.", "Actually she may have. When my mom went back to school to try to get the career she always wanted and my dad refused to help, I (16 at the time) did volunteer to step up, and so did my siblings (14 and 12) eventually. We wanted our mom to achieve her dreams, so we learned hkw to cook and took turns cooking dinner and other chores so she could focus on studying. Easier because my siblings were older and didn't require much watching but it's totally possible she volunteered.", "Maybe she would have liked to play sports or join a club but was stuck babysitting instead.

A child being forced to play parent does something to you. It takes away a childhood you can\u2019t get back and the ability to learn and do things for yourself.

I don't blame them and I understand the financial strain, but it definitely changed who I am being parentified like that, and its not fair.  \nI don't have the relationship with my brothers that my sister has or they have with each other, because they got to be friends and kids while I had to be responsible and the boss all the time. I didn't get to be one of them and it still impacts our relationships 20 years later.   \nSo for that to be recognized by them later in life is a nice gesture and the younger brothers don't understand the sacrifice", "Yeah it seems like they were forced into it.  It *is* parentification but it seems they were in crisis mode and didn\u2019t have many choices.", "Surely it is still parentification, even if it is necessary, and the parents would have preferred for it not to have been that way.

In her teenage years(after my mom went back to work), my sister would willingly babysit quite often. Our situations are different because our sister chose to babysit and wasn\u2019t forced into it but I feel like this could provide some context. My parents didn\u2019t expect us to be much trouble because we weren\u2019t when my mom was a stay at home parent, that wasn\u2019t the case. When she left for university my parents paid for an apartment just outside her school, she actually offered to continue babysitting if my parents would drop us off but they thought it was best to let her spread her wings. We gave my sister hell but it turns out that we were actually tame around her compared to the nannies my parents hired. Three of them quit within four months. My parents finally gave in and asked my sister for help. It turned out well because she got paid a few hundred per week and she actually liked us. It would suck being a teenage daughter and being forced into watching THREE brothers.", "Having essentially raised my four younger brothers, from when i was ~8-21, i guarantee this is the case.\n\nYTA, op.
