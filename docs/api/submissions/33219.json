I live in another city far away due to work, but I'll be going back home for the holidays (yay!).\n\nAnother quick addition: my parents aren\u2019t exactly the most wealthy, but they get by. I send money to my parents every month as well. My brother doesn\u2019t make as much money as I do, but he makes good enough money to not be considered \u201cpoor\u201d. However, he often makes bad choices with money, spending a ton on his hobbies but barely spending money on some necessities. He frequently borrows money from my parents and me for other things.\n\nSo anyway, I suggested to my parents that we all should go to this really good restaurant in our city on NYE. It is a fancy buffet with all the good food, and yes, it is slightly pricey but not EXTREMELY expensive. I told my parents that I would be paying for them and also my younger sister (she\u2019s still in university).\n\nI then told my brother about this idea, and he immediately rejected it, saying it\u2019s too expensive and how it\u2019s a waste of money. He doesn\u2019t want to pay a penny for it. I know he can afford this because he has spent tons more on his hobbies. I told him that it would be nice if he joined because my dad really wants to have the family together for dinner. My brother refused and said it\u2019s not fair for him because it\u2019s too expensive, and he won\u2019t pay for it unless I help pay for it as well. I absolutely refused because why would I be paying for my brother and his wife as well? We all have jobs here!\n\nMy dad found out about this, and he was upset because he really wants to have a full family dinner since I only get to come home during the holidays. He then offered to pay for my brother and his wife, and my mom got angry because she was like, why would you do that? He can pay for himself. My brother then got angry at me and told me that I should have just stuck to the original plan that my dad made, which is that we do some kind of potluck at home. I told him this isn\u2019t something we do often, and growing up not so wealthy, I\u2019d love to treat our parents once in a while.\n\nMy brother and his wife were like, well, I don\u2019t care, we\u2019re not going, so you better make your choices.\n\nI said, okay, I guess you are eating somewhere else then and proceeded to make a reservation for just the four of us.\n\nMy brother then called me a huge asshole for splitting the family during NYE when we were supposed to spend time together, and now he has to find somewhere else to be for NYE with his wife.\n\nAITA? Should I have stuck to the original plan so we all can spend time together?", "created_utc": 1702832237, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18klmin/aita_for_making_reservations_for_new_years_dinner/", "score": 88, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your brother sounds exactly like mine. Always driving a new vehicle, always wearing expensive clothes and shoes, but God forbid you expect him to pay for himself on an outing because he just doesn't have the money for that. My mom and I spent YEARS covering my brother (and even his son's) way on various family outings and vacations because he \"couldn't afford\" to be there, but would throw an adult tantrum if he wasn't invited. We finally got sick of it and now he isn't invited to anything and it saves our mom and I a lot of money.", "NTA\n\nBut stop enabling your brother, by proxy helping your parents allows them to enable him too. If you want to help your parents, then pay their bills directly\n\nYour brother is a leech and knows he\u2019ll get bailed out, thus he\u2019ll continue his shitty spending habits\n\nDon\u2019t be surprised if dad foots their bill and they show up tho, reservation or not, he seems like the type to manipulate his way in", "NTA. If your brother is spending a lot on hobbies, you need to quit giving him money. If your parents are giving him money, quit giving them money. Pay a bill for them, or buy their groceries, but don't give money. Your brother has become entitled. He wanted you to pay for him and his wife. You created this by handing out money. I know it's out of love but you created dependency. Your brother doesn't need it. He wants hobbies. He was willing to take money from your parents. Your money. Pay bills for them, but that's it! Good luck", "Why are you giving them money when they just pass it on to your brother?\n\nDo you realise that effectively you\u2019re giving him money? Do you mind?", "NTA, Lol your brother literally said if someone doesn\u2019t pay for him he\u2019s not going, If someone is gonna guilt trip someone, they should be ready for a return to sender", "NTA. He was invited and didn't want to go. \nYour parent's shouldn't be kept from having a good time just because of him.", "I see your point of view, but why not choose a cheaper place to go to? It seems like you might be holding on to the more expensive restaurant to make the point that your brother\u2019s spending choices suck. If the object of getting together with the family is a nice meal with each other, why not do a cheaper restaurant?\n\nIf your object is to drive home to your brother that his spending is too much and he can\u2019t afford to go out, what are you expecting from this interaction? He won\u2019t admit to you that you\u2019re right or change. He will just resent you and you will have made a divide between you.", "NTA but your brother is. Stop lending him money as he obviously takes it for granted and is an ungrateful AH. If he\u2019s so concerned about the family being together he can pry open his wallet.", "NTA your brother is looking for a way to not only participate but to also stick someone else for his bill.  Tell him to take a flying leap and plan for an at home (parents) activity that doesn't involve money after you get back from dinner.", "This one is hard. I lean NTA, but I don\u2019t like posts where a person outside the core family unit decides whether or not someone can afford something or not. You don\u2019t get to set the priorities for your brother and his wife. By extension, they don\u2019t get to issue an ultimatum to you. Bro is definitely an AH. His only choice was whether or not to join for dinner. He has elected to not join, and should have graciously bowed out. \n\nBut, several things can happen here to make your life better.\n1. Stop loaning money to anyone (parents or brother). \n2. If you feel compelled to give funds, know that you need to give them without expecting repayment and without strings attached. \n3. You can choose to your parents by paying a bill directly every once in a while or buying them a freezer full of groceries. \n4. Stop discussing money entirely with anyone in your family. \n5. Stop judging adults for their choices.", "NTA\nYour brother and his wife had the choice to come and they made the choice not to.", "was it really impossible to find a cheaper but still ok restaurant? The point was: eating together, nobody has to cook. \n\nIt seems to me it is a false narrative that there were only two options here.", "NTA. But just you father proposed to pay for your brother and his wife with... the money you send to him ? Thanks to your mother to told him no ! That would have been unfair for you ! \n\nHope you had a great moment anyway !", "NTA. Sounds like your brother needs to get his priorities straight and stop mooching off of you and your parents. Plus, who doesn't want a fancy buffet on NYE? Enjoy treating yourself and your family without the entitled attitude from your brother.", ">My dad found out about this, and he was upset because he really wants to have a full family dinner\n\nYTA. Your brother may be cheap, but the question you asked was about your decision to plow forward with the reservation.  The fact that your father jumped in with the offer to pay shows that he wants your brother and SIL there, period.\n\nYou still have time to fix this.", "NTA\n\nthere is one sibling in every family that has no idea when it comes to money and is always skint, but always has money for something for them like a hobby.\n\nHave a nice meal with your Mum, Dad & Sister.

Your brother's a leech and I'm side-eyeing your enabling dad.  You know your dad's probably going to have him show up anyway, right?", "Nta. Your brother broke up the family dinner, not you.", "YTA\n\nIf you're going to take your family for a nice dinner, take your whole family. Don't use the occasion to punish your brother for his choices and force your will onto everyone involved.

Either way, stop making unilateral decisions for everyone involved.", "Yta.   It\u2019s his choice on how he spends his money even if it\u2019s irresponsibly.   You had previously agreed to plans and you switched those plans to something he doesn\u2019t want to or can\u2019t pay for and that excluded him from a family celebration on a holiday that\u2019s not cool\n\nYou want to treat your parents,  you shouldn\u2019t have agreed to the pot luck in the first place.  \n\nWho made you dictator of your families activities?\n\nI would absolutely find his behaviour frustrating,  but this isn\u2019t how you deal with it", "YTA", "NTA.

I had a sister sister-in-law like this.\n\nQuit giving your brother any kind of money. All you were doing is enabling his irresponsible spending.  Also, when it comes to your parents only pay for things that you can pay for directly. Don\u2019t give them money so that they can pass it on to your brother.  \n\nMy sister-in-law and her husband had motorcycles, boats, dirt, bikes, etc. They lived in housing, provided for by his job, so had no rent, and yet often times could not pay for their utilities. The family always jumped into rescue them, and now my sister-in-law, 60 and her behavior has not changed at all. Why should it whenever everybody else always pays her way?", "NTA. \n\nAnyway\u2026maybe you can pay for your brother and see this as a gift from you to your parents, instead of one for you brother.

Sounds like you're funding a good deal of his lifestyle and not only is that frustrating it's exhausting and you shouldn't have to keep doing it. You gotta come up with a better plan than just sending your parents money though, it's nice of them to help your brother but it seems to be with your money.", "NTA I would send him the restaurant info so he can check out the menu to decide if he wants to join and then call to be added to the reservation. \n\nIf not he can pound sand. He is not your responsibility.", "NTA. Your brother is an asshole. Good for your mom telling your father not to pay for them. Your father and you both need to stop enabling your brother financially. It wouldn\u2019t surprise me if from the money you send your dad, he gives some to your brother. Instead of sending your father money, use that same amount to pay via direct deposit some of his bills. \nStick to your plan for NYE", "NTA. Stop sending money to your brother or bailing him out.

Or at minimum he wouldn't want to splurge on this.\n\nSo why not discuss it with him before going to parents first. You put him a tough spot.\n\nNext... you are upset your parents give him money. It seems like your petty revenge was to kick him out the dinner. \n\nFinally you  use \"but my dad wants us together \" as your reason your brother should have come and paid... yet you seemed to do nothing to compromise and make that happen.

While you may know about his hobbies, you don't know what is going on in his life at the moment.

Also, you don't get to tell your brother how to spend his money.

I will pay for my parents because it\u2019s my treat to them and I know they don\u2019t get to experience this kind of thing often and for my sister because she has no source of income.
