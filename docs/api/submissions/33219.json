I live in another city far away due to work, but I'll be going back home for the holidays (yay!).\n\nAnother quick addition: my parents aren\u2019t exactly the most wealthy, but they get by. I send money to my parents every month as well. My brother doesn\u2019t make as much money as I do, but he makes good enough money to not be considered \u201cpoor\u201d. However, he often makes bad choices with money, spending a ton on his hobbies but barely spending money on some necessities. He frequently borrows money from my parents and me for other things.\n\nSo anyway, I suggested to my parents that we all should go to this really good restaurant in our city on NYE. It is a fancy buffet with all the good food, and yes, it is slightly pricey but not EXTREMELY expensive. I told my parents that I would be paying for them and also my younger sister (she\u2019s still in university).\n\nI then told my brother about this idea, and he immediately rejected it, saying it\u2019s too expensive and how it\u2019s a waste of money. He doesn\u2019t want to pay a penny for it. I know he can afford this because he has spent tons more on his hobbies. I told him that it would be nice if he joined because my dad really wants to have the family together for dinner. My brother refused and said it\u2019s not fair for him because it\u2019s too expensive, and he won\u2019t pay for it unless I help pay for it as well. I absolutely refused because why would I be paying for my brother and his wife as well? We all have jobs here!\n\nMy dad found out about this, and he was upset because he really wants to have a full family dinner since I only get to come home during the holidays. He then offered to pay for my brother and his wife, and my mom got angry because she was like, why would you do that? He can pay for himself. My brother then got angry at me and told me that I should have just stuck to the original plan that my dad made, which is that we do some kind of potluck at home. I told him this isn\u2019t something we do often, and growing up not so wealthy, I\u2019d love to treat our parents once in a while.\n\nMy brother and his wife were like, well, I don\u2019t care, we\u2019re not going, so you better make your choices.\n\nI said, okay, I guess you are eating somewhere else then and proceeded to make a reservation for just the four of us.\n\nMy brother then called me a huge asshole for splitting the family during NYE when we were supposed to spend time together, and now he has to find somewhere else to be for NYE with his wife.\n\nAITA? Should I have stuck to the original plan so we all can spend time together?", "created_utc": 1702832237, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18klmin/aita_for_making_reservations_for_new_years_dinner/", "score": 973, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The plan was a potluck at home within everyone's budget.

Everyone knows he doesn't have good budgeting skills. You're not close to your brother to know exactly his situation. It's been a difficult few years, the same salary you made in 2019 might not stretch as far in 2023. \n\nWhat is the difference between your brother's situation and your parents situation? Your parents earn enough that if they had good budgeting skills, they could pay for themselves. But they don't have good budgeting skills.

Nevermind that your financial planner is the same as before, and also don't mention your financial planner is you.\n\nLook, I get it. You're in a good position, your parents are not. However, when it becomes obvious that you sending money to your parents doesn't actually benefit them, but does benefit someone else, it's time to rethink your strategy. Earmark the money in case of an emergency, so if their hot water heater goes out you can pay for that. Or if something happens and they can't pay their deductible, you have it covered. Put it in a trust, if you want full transparency with your parents.\n\nWere you an AH for making reservations because you wanted to treat your parents? No. Could you have given more advanced notice of the plan? Definitely. Do you have the right to be judgmental about how your brother spends his money? Well, that's a gray area. If his poor spending habits doesn't affect anyone else, then no. However, if his poor spending habits has him \"borrowing\" money from you parents on a regular basis, leaving them no better off, then yes.\n\nI have a parent who makes the abolute worst decisions when it comes to money. Sure, it comes from a good place as they help others when needed. But that's the problem, they have now become the first option instead of the last. They had gotten completely out of debt and was so happy, swearing it would never happen again, only for someone needing a new set of tires they couldn't afford and there goes my parent, getting a loan from one of those payday loan places and the cycle continues. It's part of the poverty mindset and it drives me bonkers. Not that I'm really in a better position, but because I have worked hard to change that mindset myself and see the pitfalls from the past, still alive and well within my parental unit.\n\nDo not use your improved financial standing as a weapon, but don't use it as an award either. Helping is only helping if it improves a person's life, allowing them to make progress out of their situation. Otherwise, it's called enabling.\n\nI'm calling ESH because your brother hasn't grown up, your parents haven't put their foot down (causing them to need your assistance on a monthly basis), and you think that just because you wanted to treat your parents to a different experience means you can toss out everyone else's plans.", "YTA. \n\nThis isn\u2019t just a dinner you have decided to host or invite people to, it\u2019s your family\u2019s plans for New Year\u2019s Eve.

It's entirely reasonable for your brother to be upset at you for going out of your way to change the plans to ensure he can't be part of a family gathering without spending money that he didn't budget for this.

And you don\u2019t get to spend other people\u2019s money for them.", ">Frankly, OP doesn't get to decide how his brother's family budgets their own money.\n\nNo, but they do get to judge and be frustrated by the brother making what he prioritizes and cares about extremely clear. If someone makes it obvious to me that they care more about their hobbies than about spending time with me, then no, I am certainly not going to shell out money to cover their dinner, nor am I going to change my plans to accommodate them. \n\n>But that's not something to express by wrecking your family holiday plans.\n\nThe plans aren't 'wrecked' as far as I can tell? The mom is quite happy to go and it sounds like everyone's going to go along with it. The only one unhappy is the brother. \n\nIf the mom is expressing that she doesn't feel like cooking, it seems obvious to me that the prior plan involved her cooking. And maybe she'd like to go out for a change rather than having a slightly crappy potluck at home to accommodate her son who doesn't know how to manage his money.", "It's not just that the brother spends money on hobbies, he also borrows money from OP and his parents. The mother is on record saying that he can pay for it himself, so clearly she doesn't feel like OP should be more sympathetic, it's just the dad. \n\nIt's not as though there aren't people in this world who have tons of cash when it comes to something they want to buy but then clam up or need to borrow when it comes time for everything else. I've been friends with some of them and have some of them as relatives, too. They're irritating and changing plans to accommodate them just encourages and enables the behaviour.", "He says he knows he can afford it. Literally a comment he makes in his post.", ">The plans aren't 'wrecked' as far as I can tell? The mom is quite happy to go and it sounds like everyone's going to go along with it. The only one unhappy is the brother.\n\nI think you should review the post.  The OP seems to be the only one completely happy with the situation.  OP's mother and father are in an argument now because his father wants the whole family to be able to get together.  OP's brother is of course unhappy.  No comment is made on how OP's sister feels about it.  At *best* it's 3 people who are alright with the plan and 2 people who are very much not okay with it.   But the OP gets to make a point about how they feel about their brother's financial decisions, so maybe sabotaging the family get together is a small price to pay.", "I think my main issue is that OP unilaterally made a choice to move the dinner to a restaurant and ensured that choice would be supported by saying they\u2019d pay for mom, dad, and younger sibling.  After this, they told the brother of the plans and just expected him to be okay with this.  To be honest, I could afford this, but if someone did what OP did, I would object on principle.  Maybe the cost of the dinner is beyond his means.  If he does frequently borrow money from the folks, it stands to reason he would not be able to afford the dinner.  So, OP essentially locked him out of the dinner.  \n\nThe more reasonable thing would have been to come together with the brother and decide on a place together.", "And I am saying he literally does not know.", "> So, OP essentially locked him out of the dinner.\n\nlol come on. The brother can simply not buy another toy for one of his hobbies he doesn't actually need. Going out to a nice dinner with the family is not a wild and crazy idea.\n\nIf OP did agree to pay for the brother guarantee dude would order the most expensive everything.", "I\u2019m basing my fact on the comment he made. What are you basing your fact on?", "NTA.  He thought he could control everything and force you to pay for him.  He can ring in the new year with ramen now.", "Nta. Your brother sounds like he can easily attend the dinner if he made it a priority. Of course you would want to pay for your parents since it\u2019s a special occasion it\u2019s not like a regular outing. The brother and his wife can put aside some money for the meal.", "NTA\n\nI'd stop giving your brother money, and cut back on giving your parents money if they are giving it to your brother. He's a user.", "NTA... he has a choice. This is one of 365 days in a year. You can enjoy a meal together on another night.   He was trying to manipulate you into capitulating", "YTA. I get it. It sucks when you have to make plans per the cheapest person in the room. I have a friend like that. I don't make them spend money they don't want to because I don't like it when people do that to me. I just pick places I like that are to our shared tastes and budget when I want to do something with her so she can still participate without feeling like she's exceeding her planned budget. She's much more fun when she's not feeling like she's going broke. That isn't to say she doesn't have money, but that she is saving up for something else and has budgeted less for eating out that I have. And that's fine. But the family meal should be something everyone is comfortable with.\n\nI'm not saying you don't get to be a little judgmental if your brother is taking loans from your parents to pay for extravagant luxury items, though that's between him and them. You can set conditions on the money you give him, or you can refuse to give him any, but you can't really order someone to pay an amount they're not comfortable paying at a family event.", "YTA. You\u2019re paying for your parents and sister but not for your brother? And then you won\u2019t change restaurant to a cheaper one? You could have just gone to a cheaper place", "YTA If the plan was a pot luck you don\u2019t get to decide to go to an expensive restaurant and pay for everyone except him and then feel he\u2019s ruining NYE\n\nAnd yes you said you send your parents money so you are indirectly paying their share.", "NAH.  Maybe your brother can't afford it.  Stop making judgements about his \"hobbies\".  Don't loan him money anymore if you don't want to.  What's actually wrong with a potluck thing if your parents would like to spend NYE with their whole family?  Take your parents out for dinner the next night.", "If your dad can pay for his working son and daughter in law, he can pay for himself. Pay for you mom and sister only.", "Whats the name of the place? I am curious", "NTA\n\nI\u2019m poor.  Some of my friends are not.  Sometimes we go to restaurants that cost too much for me to be comfortable with.  So I eat before I go, and then I get the cheapest thing on the menu and make it last.\n\nPeople shouldn\u2019t be forced to spend money that they\u2019re not comfortable spending, but there are ways to compromise so you can still spend time together.", "Ha.  So his plan to stick you with the bill backfired.", "Wow, lots of controversy.  The way I see it, OP invited oarents and sis,offered to pay.  Offer accepted.  Invited bro but said he'd have to pay for himself.  Offer declined.  End of problem. \n\nThe fact that brother now complains he was going to have to make his own plans tells me he isn't as broke as he says.", "And if Dad does that be prepared to walk away and let dad handle the entire check while you and your wife go someplace else.   Stop sending $ to any of them.", "NTA", "Then everyone should have been happy with his brother saying no.", "It sounds like your mom doesn\u2019t get to go out to a fancy restaurant often. That\u2019s a wonderful gesture to take her. \n\nA potluck dinner means she would be spending NYE doing plenty of work\u2026 which any mother who\u2019s ever hosted & has kids would know. \n\nYour brother is a leech who already benefits & takes your $$$. \n\nNTA and as a mom THANK YOU for prioritizing your mother over your brother.", "Op lives in the same city as the parents, he could see them anytime. The Op wanted one night to take out his parents.  Someone else should get a say in the venue. The parents are not mad about it", "I feel like ops dad offering to pay for dinner was stupidity, especially since that money was most likely from OP too. \n\nMom seems to agree with OP that the brother can pay for their own dinner.\n\nMom seems to realise Ops boundaries but dad is being a bit enabling.", "The point is that OP wants to treat his parents and Sis to a nice meal; something his parents wouldn't otherwise be able to afford.  \n\nOP can suggest a pancake and sausage breakfast the next day for the whole family and he'll help cook.  \n\nBrother is an entitled jerk who is selectively frugal.  He also clearly manipulates his parents.", "That's not actually true, OP hasn't said what his sister prefers and has said that his mom (who doesn't want to cook) wants to go out. Dad wants to go out but was just willing to pay for the brother to go - there's no indication that he's saying that he doesn't want to go or that he's backing out even though OP's brother has said that he's not going. \n\nSo it actually sounds more like the majority wants to go out.", "Anyone not happy can now insist on the potluck, and things would be back to what they were before, eh?", "OK, so why does it have to be the really expensive restaurant that your brother can't afford? Why can't it be a cheaper, more affordable restaurant. That way your Mum still get's what she wants, your father gets what he wants, and your brother gets to be with his family.\n\nHonestly, it sounds VERY MUCH like you have changed the plans specifically to target and exclude your brother. That is a AH move.", "Being practical, what kind of potluck can you have?  With a guest from out of town(either staying in a hotel--kitchen?) or parents--their home kitchen).\n\nAnd the brother and sil who are takers, not givers.

The brother should've just asked to put his share on the tab since this fam is keen on always bailing him out anyways.", "Yes, *after* he \"immediately rejected\" the idea. Too bad OP had already changed the plans and made reservations (which included paying for parents and his sister, so everyone except brother, apparently). \n\nHe also asked to go back to the original pot luck idea. \n\nBasically OP made plans to take the whole family (except brother) out to a fancy dinner over the top of 'pot luck family dinner' plans, so brother's now in the position of paying through the nose for a fancy meal he doesn't want or not getting to go to the family gathering that had already been planned before OP booked the restaurant.", "> Borrowing is definitely relevant if the person has money for hobbies but then mysteriously doesn't have money for other things\n\nMost people don't have money for things they think aren't worth the money. \n\n> not even the family dinner that they apparently so desperately want to be included in.\n\nYes, he desperately wants to be included in the *family holiday dinner*. Not the fancy restaurant, thus the first attempt to firmly decline as well as the request to go back to the original pot luck plan. \n\n> Maybe if he made himself a budget or made his family and expenses a priority he'd have the cash on hand.\n\nMaybe he just thinks paying through the nose to go to a fancy restaurant on NYE is a huge waste of money?", "> It's NYE at an upscale buffet.
