NTA", "NTA\n\nOP, they were not 'delayed' you were straight up lied to. Nobody gets home from a party at eight thirty. That's usually when things start picking up. \n\nIt's like they lied to you for a variety of reasons. That you not sit if you knew it would be till late, because of your own bedtime. They lied about the number of hours, maybe because they wanted to rip you off of the cost for the extra hours. Who knows? \n\nEither way, never sit for these people again, they are clearly dishonest. Heaven forbid anything happen to the kid after you left, they'd blame you for it!", "NTA, it\u2019s 2013, they should know how to answer a cellphone.", "NTA 3 hours late with no communication is cause for concern. \n\nWhat\u2019s up with no one picking up their phone? Especially the parents, but even your parents. I get work dinners and all, but it\u2019s not that big of a deal to pick up a call from your kid.", "NTA. Do not overthink this. The father screamed at you while she should have screamed at himself and his wife.\n\nYou did the best you could. Putting a minor like yourself in that situatiin is pretty irresponsible.", "NTA, you absolutely did the right thing. WTAF is wrong with these people, your sitter is calling and you don\u2019t answer ? You could simply text or call and say so sorry we\u2019re running late is that okay. What did they expect you to do, because their behavior is ridiculous.", "NTA.  The dad is a selfish fool.  Parents don't make themselves incommunicado.", "NTA\n\nYou did the responsible, safe, logical thing.\n\nThey can blame themselves for not calling you to tell you they were going to be late and for not being reachable when you tried to call them.\n\nYou can bet your ass that if their kid was supposed to be home at 8:30 and was completely unreachable that they would be calling the police bc they would be concerned.", "NTA\nYou were left in charge of three young children and unable to contact their parents for over three hours past the point they were supposed to be back, they didn't call you and they didn't answer your calls - they could be in a ditch for all you knew.\n\nIt was a responsible, logical thing to do with the welfare of three kids in the mix.\nWell done - more should follow your example. \n\nAlso, the parents you babysat for a world class assholes and should have left you more than one contact number.", "NTA - The parents are the ones who are being extremely irresponsible here. I think that they probably felt that because you are a child and that they are adults, they did not have any need to let you know of a change in plans. This ignored the fact that you were taking responsibility for their children during that time and had no idea what was happening. All they had to do was simply call or text you with updates. After a couple of hours beyond the time that they told you that they would be home, and not being able to reach them, it's reasonable to start thinking that something bad happened like they may have gotten into a car accident or something on the way home.", "NTA. They were taking advantage of you, and putting you into an unreasonable situation. You\u2019re not the parent, and you only signed on for a set number of hours. You cannot be expected to watch their kids indefinitely, and if they don\u2019t notify you that they\u2019re going to be late, or even respond when you try to contact them, it\u2019s perfectly reasonable for you to worry that something has happened. 3 hours late with no contact is negligence at best. What if something had happened to the kids and you had to go to the emergency room? It was irresponsible of them to not monitor their phone while someone else is watching their kids.", "Nta, talk to your parents because they need to yell at their coworker. You did the right thing and those parents were irresponsible. I hope you got paid and paid extra. \n\nAgain you did the right thing here. Don\u2019t ever baby sit for them again.", "Nta you were in the right and they are the problem\n\nMy wife runs a day care and has threatened parents with this before because she closes at 6 yet certain parents try and leave their kids till 7,8,8:30 etc and once you let it slide two or three times they make that the norm", "NTA sad that a 16 year old has to act more responsibility than adults. Does this loser not understand that this is unacceptable, they could have been in a car accident or anything. Let him be upset, and never return there!", "NTA, what if they had had an accident and were on the verge of dying trapped in their car and your calling the police saved them and didn't make their kids orphans? As a parent, I commend you for all your efforts to reach out to your own parents and the patience you had. If they had mentioned in the slightest that they might be later, you would not have been concerned. If they had answered their phones - seriously, what if one of the kids was sick or injured... In 2023, these parents should know how to answer their phone and check up on their kids. The Dad is big AH for berating you.", "NTA\n\nThis was three hours past the time you were supposed to leave, with no contact from them and they were ignoring your calls. Of course you had to call the police. This had gone into child neglect by now, unless there was an emergency, in which case even more reason to involve the police.\n\nI hope you told your mother about this, because she needs to talk to her coworker. He abused your trust, left you in a horrible position, never apologised and yelled at you. He owes you an apology.", "NTA and do not babysit for them again if you can avoid\u2026", "NTA.  They ignored the phone calls and you had NO idea where they were for three hours.  Good move. Never babysit for those AHs again. \n\nWhat you did was sensible and you needed to make sure the parents were ok. You called all the people you knew that may be able to assist and they ignored you.  The police were the next logical call.  Good job.", "NTA I remember babysitting for my sister's friends on NYE many years ago. I expected them to be late but I woke up on their sofa at 6am and they weren't home! The three very young kids were waking up and I was panicked! This was before cell phones, no phone calls from them. I called my house and my sister came over about the same time that they walked in at 7:30 AM. I wish that I would have thought to call the police!", "NTA. Did you tell your parents the dad screamed at you? I would be enraged as a parent if I knew my child was trying to do the right thing and got SCREAMED at. Tell your parents so they can handle it. & demand for your money from 2-11:30pm.", "[deleted]", "NTA, 3 hours late without any contact.

I'd want to know that my children's babysitter would call the police if there was a problem.", "NTA this happened to me once. I called my own dad who came over and when the other dad got home (apparently drunk as a skunk from the bar, I don\u2019t remember that part) my dad chewed him out and made him pay me a boatload.", "I will never understand this... You leave your kids with a stranger, then make yourself completely unreachable for several hours, no checking in on them or anything.... What if they had had an accident? You are NTA, but the parents certainly are.", "NTA, if they didnt have some reason for being that late that would explain the situation then they deserve to be called on for child abandonment. You tried for three hours to get ahold of them and got nothing. \n\nEven if they had a reason, they should have A: checked in, B: Been apologetic for the lateness, not angry, and C: Should have given you steps on what to do if they were late and you werent able to stay until midnight when you werent expecting past nine.", "Something like this genuinely happened to me. I was 14 and babysat regularly for a couple (20$ for 4-5 hours. 20$ total. In 2004.

There is a 2 year old with a diaper I have no idea how to change now that the available diapers are all gone (they left 2\u2026) and what to feed the kids because I have no fucking clue what a 2 year old can eat and the 6 year old won\u2019t eat anything. My mom is horrified/ angry and wants to come there but I\u2019m 14 and want to do this on my own so I tell her I\u2019ll handle it and she starts calling me every half hour to check in. \n\n\nThey show up at 1am with happy meal for their older kid and a half assed apology about being stuck in negotiations for a big house sale (they were both realtors). The dad drove me home still only paid me 20$. \n\n\nWhen they called the next weekend to ask for me to come watch the kids my mom took the phone into the other room.

You did them a favor and they took advantage of you, scared you to the point of calling for help. Your a good sitter!", "NTA. \n\nIf they knew they were going to be running late, they should have called or responded. It's not your fault that no one, not even your parents, picked up the phone.", "NTA.

You absolutely should answer the phone from the babysitter!!!! Who knows if something happened to one of the kids!!!!!!", "NTA. I probably would have done the same thing. \n\nAt least one of them should have kept their phones charged enough to be able to be reachable.

I am very disappointed that the father yelled at you when he was clearly in the wrong. You had every right/reason to be worried after three hours of no contact. I hope they compensate you for your time and apologize for being mean. I would definitely talk with your mom about this.

I always got paid after they got back for the hours they were gone.\n\nThat being said, I do hope when OP says the parent is her mom's co-worker that that means they are not in a higher position than her mom. I babysat for my dad's boss a few times and there were never any issues, but I could see power dynamics being a problem if the parent is her mom's boss and she called the cops on them. Hopefully that's not the case!", "I don't think there's a right or wrong here. That said, when my kiddo is old enough for his own phone, I'm going to pride myself on always picking up.\n\nEdit: because it feels so damned good to be able to help him.", "I'm disabled and have a variety of in-home supports. Good support of any kind is so valuable. Cleaning, cooking, housekeeping, you name it. If your gardener just mows the lawn and blows the leaves then sure you can get away with some hack who barely know how to set one foot in front of another, but if you have trees that want trimming rather than butchering, fruit trees you want actual produce off, native plants you want flowers on etc? Having someone who knows what they're doing and doesn't need to be walked through how not to kill a tree is worth paying extra to keep them around. \n\nWe just spent over $100 on Christmas gift chocolates for our various support people to show our gratitude.", "I had an emergency only .25\u00a2 per minute cell phone in 2003 but def could have used it to call the babysitter to ask if being late is ok.", "Absolutely! Also I feel like because they paid her upfront they didn\u2019t care how late they came back. Free babysitting", "Especially answer the person who has your children. What if there was an emergency?\n\nThe parents are AHs", "Me too-- I thought it was on purpose! It was a funny joke", "Yeah, not getting back to your *babysitter* is just fucked up. How did they know she wasn't calling because one of their kids got hurt and needs to go to the ER? It was completely reasonable for her to be worried there had been a terrible accident.", "I used to give 15-20 minutes because, depending on the time of day, some of the houses I babysat at were practically locked down due to rush hour. Granted this was the days of beepers and landlines so I couldn't get ahold of the parents anyway, but whatever happened to giving out the Authorized Adult List? You know, the ones that have the *other* responsible adults on it- Grandparents, aunt/uncle, family friends??? This whole thing could have been avoided if there was another adult OP could call! \n\nGood on OP for calling the cops, though. Technically those kids were abandoned. Maybe not intentionally but still. OP did their due diligence.", "Excellent point. I don't know what the parents were doing for those three hours, but they could have avoided OP calling the police if at any point prior (preferably around 8:15 when they realized they were not going to be getting home at the planned time) they had acted like the adults that they are and called to let OP know that they were going to be running late with new estimate of time of return.  It takes very little time to excuse oneself from a party to get to a quiet location and make that call.\n\nNot answering (probably didn't hear during party) and not calling when they left (\"so sorry, missed your call, things ran a bit longer but we're headed home right now and will be there in \\[however long it takes\\]\" ... what else would OP be expected to do? Bed down in a relative stranger's (OP's mother's co-worker) house and hope for the best?\n\nOP is definitely NTA", "Even before omnipresent cellphones, they would always leave a note with where they were going to be and the phone number for that place in case of an emergency!", "shit, i was born in the early aughts and i'm probably one of the youngest people to still remember the \"not immediately able to reach someone\" (though not well, as you can probably guess).\n\nand your second thing: frankly, i've never babysat before, but i probably would have been worried that something had happened to the parents.", "I was a sitter for my siblings when my parents went out on Saturday night - they were known or had reservations. My dad always left the number of the restaurant in case of emergency - as family - they came home approximately on time \u2026 I waited up or slept on the couch until they came home \u2026 but they were my parents and I was in my own environment", "Omg you just unlocked a childhood memory of my cousin and her fianc\u00e9 who would have full conversations in brief spurts that were less than a minute to avoid more fees! \ud83d\ude02", "I am so sorry. *Hugs*", "Lots of places have driving curfews in particular for teens, especially in the first year after they get a license. So even if it is not a regular curfew, she could still get pulled over and get in trouble.", "Absolutely this! At 16, my normal curfew was 10PM during the week and 11PM on weekends. There's even a curfew law that minors can't drive alone between midnight and 5AM unless there is an emergency or they are going to work. If it was THREE HOURS after the babysitting client was supposed to return - which is half of the length of time they were hired to sit for added on! - and I couldn't reach my parents or a trusted adult, I would have called the non-emergency line.\n\n\n\nThis would have been 1997, so most folks didn't have cellphones. There is ZERO excuse for these parents not letting her know that they were running late and not answering their phones!", "And it\u2019s her mom\u2019s coworker!", "Oh also you couldn\u2019t block incoming texts but they cost 50\u00a2 each and pissed me off!", "\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "I always have my name and phone number in my wallet. I saw a thing on \u201cthe man show\u201d where Adam Coralla left a bunch of wallets with $100 bill inside but with the name and phone number of the owner. Almost every wallet was returned bc most people want to good. Criminals are going to steal a wallet, not find one on the ground and keep it. But $100 bill floating along the side of the road is fair game", "So you egged their house right?", "Yeah I can't blame you! totally deserved! (for they!)", "Absolutely, you\u2019d do this and/or start calling hospitals.", "I mean, get with the 90s, dude!", "I refuse to answer on the grounds it may incriminate me"]}
