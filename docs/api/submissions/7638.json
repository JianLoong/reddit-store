My mom and her ex divorced when he was a baby and she met my dad when my half brother was 2. I'm now 17f and my brother is 15 and my sister is 14. My half brother's dad is the world's biggest asshole. He has said repulsive stuff to me and my siblings, he turned my half brother against my dad and convinced him he's a bad dude. Because of all this my half brother hates us, hates our dad, has been cruel to me and my siblings, has repeated stuff his dad has said and 10 years ago, when he still was splitting time between both houses, brought his dad into our house and made sure we could all hear what this man thought of us. I suffered a lot after that incident. I spent the first seven years of my life hearing I was ugly, that I should have been dead, wishing bad things on me, and then that. It was when I realized that my half brother really did hate us and would never give a crap because he was as twisted as his dad. I guess I should be glad it was only ever words?\n\nMy parents never gave up on the idea he would see sense, and have corrected me over the years saying I only have two siblings and that my half brother hates us. My parents have put me in therapy with the intent of me holding onto love for him and being willing to welcome him back whenever he comes around, regardless of whether he apologizes or not because \"it might be too hard for him to face what his dad has done to him\".

I got my paternal grandparents involved and they were outraged and offered to take us when the party happens instead but that was dismissed. My parents and maternal grandparents then sat us down and told us we are going, we are going to give the family a chance to heal and we should be happy to see our big brother again. I snapped and I told them that they all suck and if the three of us (me and my siblings) end up with shitty self esteem and if we end up fucked up as adults, they can blame themselves for subjecting us to two people who viciously hate us and have said things most would turn anyone away for saying. I got into pretty big trouble for saying that and they told me it was a horrible thing to wish on us and say to them.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1674037440, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10f41bx/aita_for_telling_my_parents_and_maternal/", "score": 25, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Still, this is madly unhealthy.  For you.", "NTA, in surprised your therapist hasn't told them they're asking for impossible things and that they need to support and respect your boundaries.", "NTA. After all your half brother and his dad have done it's completely understandable that you don't want to go to the wedding anniversary if they are present. You should also be old enough to decide that for yourself and it really sucks that your parents are forcing you and your siblings to go anyway despite neither of you wanting to go. I think your parents and maternal grandparents are the assholes for forcing you to go and your half-brother for forcing his dad to be invited (by saying he won't go otherwise), who isn't even related to the maternal grandparents anymore since he divorced your mom.", "NTA\n\nAt this point cut your maternal grandparents and parents out. You\u2019re almost of age. Go live with your paternal grandparents. \n\nThe fact that both your parents and maternal grandparents know exactly what your half brother has been doing and saying to you and your siblings and still insist to have him around you all; and for you guys to just act like nothing happened for all those years with all that verbal abuse etc is beyond me. I understand that they want you siblings to get along, but by the sounds of things the dude will never change. Especially if he\u2019s around his bio dad all the time, nothings gonna change. So yeah they can suck it.", "NTA. Why would your family want to bring this step dude around? Why would he want to bring his father? Why aren't your parents trying to protect you all from this abuse? This is some BS, imo. OP, you and your other siblings need to get away from these folks ASAP.", "NTA. It would be very convenient to get sick the day before. Maybe gastro or covid? Then you would have to stay home so you didn\u2019t make your grandparents sick.", "NTA. In an attempt to coddle your brother because of what he's been through your parents and grandparents are doing a shitty job of protecting you and your other siblings. Your brother doesn't have to like you guys but you are certainly allowed to live a life without verbal abuse. If they're so worried about your brother they should send him to therapy not give him additional excuses to abuse you guys.", "Well, you sure didn't say anything nice to them, but it also sounds like they deserve it. NTA.", "Nta.", "NTA, but why did your parents do anything to stop this, and allowed your brother to treat you like this?  Did they ever once stand up for you, and your siblings?  How they could allow this is beyond me.  I hope they all realize that they just invited two people who are going to be what is supposed to be a happy occasion, a boat load of drama, and mistreatment.  They also shouldn't be surprised when at least you go NC as soon as you can get out of their houss.  I am surprised that your therapist hasn't told your parents that allow you to be treated like this is destroying you.  I don't blame you for not wanting to willingly subject yourself to more abuse.", "Nta\n\nThose people made it abundantly clear what they think of you, and you are as free to express your opinion of them.\nAnd your parents and grandparents never stood up for you and your siblings against unacceptable behavior, this is a red flag. \n\nFamily is a matter of choice, people who care, but are not blood related can be more family than those linked to you by ties if blood.\n\nAnd nope, appearances be damned, they caused the problem, they are the ones needing to approach those that they wronged.\n\nThe victim offering avenues again and again, how insane is that?\n\nThe grandparents want a united family, okay, then they should look up what party was wronged and who is due restitution.\n\nPersonally I would make it a demand for that step sibling and father to not attend, if they want me there, I would understand it, if the grandparents chose those people over me, but also then be less concerned with the people that ignored my misgivings.\nHave a nice party, You know why I will not be part of it.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It took me a while to not vote E.SH because you are so strident but what it comes down to is : you have the right to avoid two people who have mistreated and alienated you. The grandparents are AHs for giving in to their oldest grandson\u2019s threat that he won\u2019t come to their 50th anniversary party unless your mom\u2019s ex-husband as of 25 years ago is included. wtf?  Your mother and grandparents are ahs to think any grand \u2018healing\u2019 is going to take place at an anniversary party or any other big event like a wedding or a funeral, for that matter.", "I don't see the therapist anymore, sadly.", "I can't abandon my younger siblings to that. They won't be protected and they won't have someone they can turn to. At least I can be there for them if I don't leave.", "My half brother is my mom's son and my grandparents grandson so that's why.", "They had him in therapy as a kid. But I never felt like they did a good job of standing up for us, the kids who had no escape from the way we were treated, since they never shielded us from the hate we got.", "I don't get a say in that. My parents have clearly made that clear to me and to my siblings.", "He knows what he's doing. He knows things are going to be said and that it will make at least some of us very uncomfortable having his dad around. This is just perfect for my half brother.", "And they won't at this party either.  Are they willing to throw him, and his father who shouldn't even be there, out if they start to abuse you and your siblings?", "So you will make it clear that your parents and grandparents will face resentment for that application of duress.\n\nAlso ask them why they do not protect you and your siblings from the abusers?\nDo they really think that abusers and enablers are more important than the victims/ their (grand) children?\n\nAre there any ways for you to get out of sight at the event? \n\nOr to cause a scene if you (and your siblings) are approached by the abuser? \n\nLike say, as loud reply to any insult \"you must know, you are speaking from personal experience, being worthless and you are projecting your inferiority onto others\".\n\nIs the any way to record insults? (in order to shame the people in family chats et cetera/as evidence or pressuring material to avoid such exposure in the future.)", "I don't see that happening at all. They want my half brother there and they know he'd walk if his dad gets kicked out.", "There's no way to stay out of sight. We'll just have to deal with it if I can't figure a way out for us. My half brother's dad terrifies me. The man is a raging asshole and I hate him but man do I get bad vibes around him. Probably from all the years of having harm wished on me by him.", "So basically what's they're essentially saying is he is more important than you, and your siblings.  Like I said, as soon as you can get out of there, do it.  Go LC or NC with your parents, and focus on working through the damage those two have done to you.", "Then be close to the people who either asked for the meeting, or those who forced you to that meeting and if any remark comes up, you ask them:\n\nIs this acceptable?\n\nIs this worth it?\n\nI will remember you forcing this on me. \n\nReign in your family. \n\nDo you really accept your family being treated this way?\n\nWhat did you do wrong as parent, if this is the result?\n\nSorry. If I come off as rude, but I tend to not have regrets over removing drama and toxicity from my life.\nIf the parents and grandparents want to foster rese tment towards them in you and your siblings, kudos to them, this is a sure way to unlock that achievement.\n\nYour stepbrother and his father made it abundantly clear that you are not their family, you respect that decision and reciprocate it.", "I will. But I'll probably stay as long as I need to for my siblings. They'll need someone else in the corner and I'll have the easiest time being that with how bad things went with my paternal grandparents and my parents."]}
