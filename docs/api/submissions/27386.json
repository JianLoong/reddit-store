We had no problems up until now\nFor privacy reasons let's call him Jack. \nJack and me started dating about 4 years now. His parents know that he's gay\n\nNow getting to the issue MIL would show up at random times of the day to \"plan our wedding\" I had to cancel many events that i made with my husband because she would show up. She tried telling us that we needed certain colors to the wedding. A specific area where we needed to get married so on and so on She wouldn't let me put in any opinions. My husband is the one that wants a big fancy wedding But I don't really do good with planning but I should get at least an opinion on what we're doing... (Like where we're getting married color theme etc) This would continue for weeks she would try to control every little thing to our wedding I picked out the suit that I wanted to wear And she demanded to see it and I said that she didn't need to because it's how I liked it. And I don't want her ruining the one thing I could pick out. She didn't say much so I thought that was the end of it so I went to go talk to my husband for a little bit. I went in my room to grab something and I saw her snapping through my clothes trying to find my suit\n\n\nOf course I got mad...I told Jack that I was upset about it but he said it was no big deal but I wanted it to be a surprise for both my husband and everyone else. ( It was a really nice suit) it was the first time that I ever spent a large amount of money on something  special. So I started yelling at her that she had no business snooping through my things and that all she's been doing is controlling our wedding that's not even hers and that she should be uninvited to the wedding I also told her that I don't get how my husband can be so attached to her when she does nothing but snoop in people's business. And try to control every little thing in their life She started tearing up and walked out of the house and my husband started yelling at me saying that I was a big as**hole for making his mom cry. He left the house and MIL texted the entire family and  they all are all on my husband's and M.I.L side. So am I the as**hole?\n\n\nEDIT This is not really an update on the situation. BUT  I've been seeing a question that I'm going to answer and I want to give more detail on my mother-in-law since I didn't give much detail on her in the last post.\n\nThe question I've been seen is she paying for the wedding? No she is not She hasn't put a penny into this wedding She picks out the things and it tells to pay for it which my fiance gladly does for her. (He also didn't even pick out much for the wedding)\n\nHere are some things that my mother-in-law would do to me that I've noticed throughout the years that I've dated him\n\nShe would make fun of my job saying that I do not make enough to provide for my fiance.\nLike I said in the last post she would come over to our house unannounced and we would have to cancel our dates. And things that I had planned  every time she does this I ask her politely to not do that and to tell me or my fiance when she would be coming over so I can plan ahead. Every time I tell her that she says \"yeah I'll do that\" but never does. Every time she does come over she doesn't even say hi to me She works right past me and goes to my fiance and starts talking to him.\n\n I would also cook for my fiance when she is over but she says \" it looks bad\" or \" I could do better for him\" He never steps in and says anything to her she's been doing this for years come in my house unannounced and shame me on many things. This wedding was my limit with her", "created_utc": 1695373201, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16p59gv/aita_for_making_my_soon_to_be_motherinlaw_cry/", "score": 584, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Which has now created a shit ton of drama. \n\nIt very much sounds like you and your fiance need to attend some couples counseling to learn to communicate with each other better. And perhaps individual therapy for yourself as well to learn to be more assertive. You can be assertive, set boundaries and re-enforce those boundaries in a way that doesn't result in a big blow up of emotions. \n\nEveryone involved was in the wrong in some way. But unfortunately I feel the best way out of this and to move forward is going to be you apologizing for how you blew up at your future MIL. Not because your emotions are wrong, but for how you expressed them. Explaining to her that you feel as though she has ignored you thoughts, feelings and opinions regard Yours and Jack's wedding. And that Jack was completely dismissive of your feeling about this when he said it was no big deal. Perhaps tell this to both of them together. That both of their actions have made you feel like an outsider in your own relationship and that they have left you feeling like your thoughts, feelings and opinions don't matter.\n\nIf they aren't able to understand how they have wronged you.

You need him to look his mother in the eye and say \"Mom, you're bring mean to the love of my life. Please, for once, shut up.\" \n\nPre-marital/couples counselling is nonnegotiable at this point. Put the wedding off until boundaries are set and maintained. Otherwise, you may need to reconsider if this is the man you want to marry. \n\nBecause if you marry him while things are like this, you aren't just marrying Jack. You're also marrying Jack's mom.", "OP, if this were me, I\u2019d be putting the wedding on hold until my fianc\u00e9 and I could get on the same page about this. \n\nHow decisions will be made for your household is a really big deal, and you should both agree on how that\u2019s going to work before you get married.", "This, 100% this, I'm sorry sweetie but it seems like neither one of them actually respects you or your boundaries. And if your fiance does, he won't stand up for you and your boundaries to others, at least not his mother. You might have to tell him to get his priorities straight. YOU are the one he is marrying, not his mother, and if he wants to keep it that way, then he needs to stand up for you and make people respect you and your boundaries. That simple. If he won't, leave him.", "NTA your yelling was justified. It\u2019s sad it came down to be the point that you had to yell. Your MIL knows no boundaries. It\u2019s easy to leave mama\u2019s boy then to divorce mama\u2019s boy. Both of these are lot easier than to live with mama\u2019s boy. Good luck \ud83e\udd1e", "Nope nope nope.\n\nTbh your fianc\u00e9 is wrong.\n\nSo so wrong.\n\nHe\u2019s allowed his mother to pretty much erase you from your own wedding and just be a prop.\n\nNot even your own wedding suit??? She can\u2019t even leave that alone.\n\nIf this still goes ahead, I would strongly suggest relationship counselling before you do\u2026 otherwise you are almost literally marrying his mother as well.", "NTA it\u2019s YOUR wedding not hers.", "If the MIL is the much bigger asshole, and the future husband went to bat only for her feelings \u2026 wouldn\u2019t E S H make more sense than Y T A? \n\nShe asked to see the suit. It seems to me that telling her no, it\u2019s how he likes it is a pleasantly firm way to have expressed his boundary here. Instead of respecting that boundary she decided to go on a little  self-imposed eye-spy mission because she didn\u2019t like being told no. Only then did he hit his breaking point. Delivery sucked a bit, but it\u2019s understandable when you find someone going against your wishes and feeling entitled to start rummaging around your belongings looking for the thing you\u2019ve been told you don\u2019t get to see.", "I mean, she was told no and her response was to go and start crossing even more boundaries by snooping through his stuff. It seems like there\u2019s more than just an overbearing personality at work. This woman feels so entitled despite being told no that she hops right on over the boundary and does what she wants anyway. There\u2019s a weird level of self importance and inability to accept criticism of her actions when she\u2019s clearly in the wrong. To top it off her response to being called out for crossing the boundary was to then involve the entire family by texting them to get ahead of the story so she play the victim. \n\nIf she had just been over excited about the whole thing I don\u2019t think it\u2019d have played out like it did. She seems to keep an awful lot of control over her adult son which \u2026 is not healthy or a normal dynamic. At minimum there\u2019s a pretty unhealthy family dynamic at play here where her adult children just let her steamroll through because their lives are easier that way compared to enforcing reasonable boundaries. \n\nUnder no circumstances should a woman old enough  to have a 30 year old son need to be told it\u2019s not acceptable to go rooting through his fianc\u00e9e\u2019s closet.", "Judging by the amounts of posts I see about that, probably lol. She sounds awful.", "Based on how many posts I've read on Reddit where women have to deal with serious MIL issues, I'm gonna go with yes. Yes, she would steamroll a bride on wedding planning this much. I've read far too many stories about women having to deal with their future MIL trying to control and dictate every single thing about the wedding and the poor woman's fiance always knuckles under to his mommy and says things like \"Oh, that's just how she is\" or \"She doesn't mean anything by it\""]}
