And I don't want her ruining the one thing I could pick out. She didn't say much so I thought that was the end of it so I went to go talk to my husband for a little bit. I went in my room to grab something and I saw her snapping through my clothes trying to find my suit\n\n\nOf course I got mad...I told Jack that I was upset about it but he said it was no big deal but I wanted it to be a surprise for both my husband and everyone else.

It doesn\u2019t seem like you\u2019ll be married to your husband, but your MIL as well. Seems crowded. \n\nYour fianc\u00e9e is really letting you down.", "Dude, you definitely have a (future) husband problem. I'd totally run if I was you. NTA", "Run.\n\nHe is always go to prioritise his mother and her feelings over you. At least you have seen it now before you are married, rather than after. There's a very popular saying on reddit that it's much easier to dump a Muma's boy than it is to divorce one.", "Are you sure you want to proceed with the wedding? That sounds a lot like emotional incest. Your fianc\u00e9 needs therapy for this but if he doesn\u2019t see it as a problem you will probably be also marrying his mother.\n\nNTA.", "NTA.

You deserve better! NTA!", "Oh dear. She\u2019s a nightmare. And I\u2019m afraid he\u2019s a wimp. Give this wedding a long hard look. It doesn\u2019t auger well that he lets her behave like this.

Reminds me of the post where the bride caught MIL in the wedding dress and fianc\u00e9 let MIL wear it.  Not okay in the least! Jack is wrong and is not supporting you.  Calling you out to the family is just trying to make themselves look better.  Sounds like you need to sit down and have a long talk with Jack.", "NTA. I don't know what it is about people who have to try and plan their kid's weddings like it's theirs. It happens WAY too often and it needs to stop, and people like that need to hear it. I mean she was rummaging through your clothes ffs!!! How deos she not see that as inappropriate or too snoopy?! Then she turns on the water works and gets everyone's sympathy so she can get out of owning up to what she knows is shitty behaviour.", "nope, NTA. I\u2019m sorry you have such a huge problem with the guy you are going to marry - because this is definitely even more of a bf problem than MIL problem. He should be defending YOU and supporting YOU.

She shouldn't have been snooping through your things.", "Run. NTA.", "NTA, she sounds awful.\n\nBut you need to take a step back and evaluate.  Your fiance missed a perfect opportunity to establish boundaries with his mother, but didn't.  Instead he invalidated your feelings and showed you exactly what your life with him (and his mother) is about to be like.  \n\nIs that how you want to live?  With DH always supporting his overbearing mother?", "NTA. He's shown you that his mother's feelings are more important than yours. This won't stop after you're married. \n\nPersonally, I wouldn't marry him unless he changed his tune. There's a difference between having a healthy relationship with your mom and whatever this is.", "NTA \n\nYou might want to have a long sit down with your husband and explain that you are a grown adult who can make his own decisions and choices that are not up for debate with his mother.\n\nIf he expects things to work out with you, he needs to rein his mother in.\n\nGetting married should be about people getting married, not the mil dictating what is going to happen.", "NTA\n\nif you ignore the huge red flag where your future husband takes Mommy's side now, when she's clearly not respecting your boundaries nor your privacy, MIL will always be in your marriage.

I think you should just try to talk to your husband and tell him what you told us and how you feel. Then tell her hey we are gonna be a family I wanna welcome you with open arms. But you have to hear me out. I think it just all kindof came out because you maybe didn't set those boundaries in the beginning.

If you have children, buy a home, try to move\u2026.\nOnce you come to a conclusion on if it\u2019s. A huge deal or not, you need to discuss it with your partner and discuss boundaries. \nI married a half-way-mommas-boy who saw no wrong doing by his mother. She\u2019s a major boundary stepper who throws an \u201coops sorry\u201d over her shoulder on her way out\u2026but because she\u2019s petite and sweet no one every saw any issue with it. Fast forward to a marriage and 2 kids later and he is the boundary setter, he is the one who speaks to her to keep her in her lane. She\u2019s lovely but when we got married majorly overstepped and somewhat ruined our relationship. You can bounce back but you have to want it, and your husband has to support you.", "ESH\n\nYour future MIL sucks for not understanding boundaries. \n\nYour future Husband sucks for not discussing, setting and re-enforcing boundaries. \n\nAnd you suck for how you handle the entire situation. \n\nNow you have ever right to all the feelings you are having regarding the situation. Your not wrong for having them at all and would never tell you that. But you are wrong for how you handled them and how you communicated them to both your fiance and your future MIL. \n\nBoth you and your Fiance are in need of some help in a communication department. You had issues with how involved your future MIL is in your wedding planning. You and your fiance have issues communicating your feelings regarding both the planning and how his mother is acting. And all this results in you blowing up in a way that was intended to be hurtful. Which has now created a shit ton of drama. \n\nIt very much sounds like you and your fiance need to attend some couples counseling to learn to communicate with each other better. And perhaps individual therapy for yourself as well to learn to be more assertive. You can be assertive, set boundaries and re-enforce those boundaries in a way that doesn't result in a big blow up of emotions. \n\nEveryone involved was in the wrong in some way. But unfortunately I feel the best way out of this and to move forward is going to be you apologizing for how you blew up at your future MIL. Not because your emotions are wrong, but for how you expressed them. Explaining to her that you feel as though she has ignored you thoughts, feelings and opinions regard Yours and Jack's wedding. And that Jack was completely dismissive of your feeling about this when he said it was no big deal. Perhaps tell this to both of them together. That both of their actions have made you feel like an outsider in your own relationship and that they have left you feeling like your thoughts, feelings and opinions don't matter.\n\nIf they aren't able to understand how they have wronged you. Then you know exactly how the future will go. And at that point you need to ask yourself if this is what you want.", "NTA but your husband is TA.", "YTA. You're not wrong about your MIL overstepping. But you are TA for the way you handled it and caused hurt for your partner.", "Maybe she\u2019s just excited that her son is getting married and she\u2019s really into the wedding. She sounds like she is overstepping some boundaries.  But you did yell at your husband\u2019s mother.  You can be firm and assert your boundaries but you didn\u2019t have to unload on her.

Your MIL is the biggest AH here, your fianc\u00e9 is the second biggest, but you threw a tantrum.\n\nNext steps are counseling - you need a mediator here who can help you and your future husband sort through your communication issues. If he still isn't listening to your concerns after couples therapy, it's time to reconsider getting married at all. However, this might be just the thing to get him to really understand your feelings, and for you to find healthy ways to express your needs and boundaries.\n\nAlso, definitely get a wedding planner. MIL shouldn't be planning like that and your fianc\u00e9 needs to understand how she has been running roughshod over you. Your wedding should be yours.

I'm shocked everyone telling him it's ok to totally lose your sh!t and yell at someone, let alone your partners mother lol. What next, it's ok to yell at your step-children when they misbehave?
