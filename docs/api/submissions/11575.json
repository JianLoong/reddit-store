The irony is that your joke treated them as normal people and it did not belittle them in any way, while the girl's comment was homophobic because she basically assumed that because they were gay, they wouldn't be able to handle any jokes about their sexuality, even ones that treated them like everyone else.", "NTA, as another gay guy i find this funny, youre not being rude and your friends thought it was funny, too. shes trying to get woke points when none of the gays agree with it.", "NTA if you're good friends and they laughed.", "NTA. It doesn\u2019t seem homophobic to me. If they were uncomfortable with the fact that you were making a joke about their sex life, that would be fair, but it doesn\u2019t sound like they cared.", "I was expecting to think otherwise at first, but I gotta go with NTA.\n\nFrom my perspective, you didn't make a homophobic joke, you made a racy joke that riffed off of the earlier activities, and it just *happened to involve* a gay couple.\n\nBut: disclosure, I'm a middle-aged cishet dude.  If there's a chorus of people who are actual members of that community who don't see it like I do, you should absolutely take their word over mine.

Simply making a joke regarding the fact that two people are gay is not making a joke at the expense of them or their homosexuality. You're totally in the clear. She's missing the point.", "NTA; she sounds like one of those people who think they can decide when other people should be offended.  People are allowed to be okay with their friends making jokes about them.", "I was about to vote Y T A based on the title but clearly NTA especially as the concerned party also found it funny!", "NTA. It might have been inappropriate (if this was something either of them were insecure about), but it certainly wasn't homophobic.", "As a licensed homo I woulda laughed my ass off, lotsa white people make it their job to get offended for people.

You didn't even use any \"bad words\" or anything just a quick response to what someone said. NTA.", "NTA, it's not a homophobic joke, it's a gay joke.

Just because someone laughs doesn't mean it didn't bother them. So many times, we'll laugh nervously or because everyone else is laughing when we're actually hurting a little bit inside.", "NAH. There's nothing homophobic about the joke. It could easily apply to all kinds of relationships. The question is whether it's appropriate to joke about your friends' potentially sensitive sexual issues at all. \n\nWould you have made the same kind of joke about a heterosexual couple? If not, and you felt ok joking about a gay couple because they are gay, then it would be homophobic and YWBTA. However, more information is needed, and they way the story is portrayed makes it sound like nobody was offended, so NAH.", "NTA at all", "NTA. If something is homophobic it's insulting/damaging towards homosexual people. You just made a joke that made sense in the context.

It would be one thing if you had made that comment amongst people you don't know well and this case. There's a closeness between old friends that they have learned to laugh at themselves with each other, so no you're not.", "NTA, and the girl is totally an AH.\n\nJokes are fine. If the ones involved laugh, everything is more than ok, and if not, you apologise and try to do better.\n\nThing here is that someone, who didn't have anything to do with the joke, felt offended on behalf of others.

The joke isn\u2019t \u201cgay people are bad or stereotypical\u201d the joke was \u201csex lmao\u201d", "definitely not the asshole, my sister had a situation similar to this where she called the bowl you drop into when skating a tr*bby and everyone except her trans friend got mad at her.", "NYA. People need to stop getting offended over nothing.", "NTA. Though the guys weren't offended she was. So an apology to her might be called for. Dirty jokes aren't for everyone.", "NTA. If she's straight, she has no right to speak on our behalf. You're mates with them and banter is banter.", "YTA for this part:\n\n> I pointed out neither of the two gay people in the situation found it homophobic...\n\nThis is a good point if it's true. The problem is, people often feel pressured to laugh off stuff even if it does bother them, because they don't want to make a big deal about it. So maybe you're right and they really didn't have a problem with it, but if they did, using them as an excuse just makes it worse.\n\nThe joke is probably fine, but don't use \"my black friend\" logic to defend yourself, even if you're right.", "Even if it would normally be considered homophobic if the people you were making the joke about laughed and thought it was funny it isn\u2019t. Same is being a white person in a predominantly black friend group being able to say the N-word with his/her/their friends due to having the N pass with those people, it\u2019s not racist because it\u2019s within the group. Malicious intent is required before it has the negative connotations", "I mean I think you know what the right answer here is", "NTA based on the context of them being cool with it and you having a preexisting relationship with them that allowed you to gage whether they'd be OK with it before you even said it.", "NTA. It wasn\u2019t homophobic and it was funny. Neither gay guy was upset.  The complaining girl is the one with a stick up her ass.", "NTA. I would bet any sexual joke you make including those two friends from now on will garner the same response from her.", "It is bad but in that situation, not really. If they are your friends then it\u2019s ok. I guess if they feel offended, they will tell you. But generally you shouldn\u2019t say that. Also, it\u2019s a joke about their private life. I wouldn\u2019t stand up comedy like that.", "especially on the behalf of people who aren\u2019t even upset by it", "Yeah, it was stupid of her to get offended on behalf of two people who found it funny imo", "yeah, I do bust my straight friend\u2019s balls like that too.", "Exactly this ^^^", "They are and they did", "they found it pretty funny", "Nope, I agree here.\n\nIf there\u2019s any problem to be had with your comment, it\u2019s that it takes a stab at someone\u2019s feelings towards sex in their current life and maybe they found that rude, embarrassing, etc,\n\nNothing about it was homophobic- OP literally *acknowledged* them as a couple within the comment.", "Yeah, they both have the type of humor that would make them think it\u2019s funny", "I figured it wasn\u2019t since they spoke about it openly and without hesitating when it came up", "That\u2019s a good point", "There's another joke here about that stick but I'm too lazy to put it together...", "Exactly. In a way, it\u2019s worse on her behalf.

I\u2019m just worried apologizing to her for this situation will just embolden her to claim everything is wrong", "The difference between the black friend case and this is that I\u2019m not defending my comment on the basis of my *having* gay friends, but because my gay friends who are ehe subject of the joke find it funny. \n\nAnd as I said in the OP, I\u2019ve known both of them for years, and they\u2019re not the type to brush it off.", "Why do you think it\u2019s bad?", "It\u2019s very dependent on the friendship though. I have friends that I can absolutely joke with about stuff like that and more and some that would feel it\u2019s inappropriate. The key here to being funny is not saying something overtly offensive and knowing you audience and it sounds like OP did do that from what we know", "And that is exactly why your joke wasn't homophobic. You cracked a joke about your friends...not about them being gay. NTA.", "I think you\u2019re in the clear then", "I don't think we're disagreeing even slightly.\n\nThe stuff you're finding potentially problematic, depending on how people took it, is exactly what I figured would be implied by \"a racy joke\".  I do not consider racy jokes to always be appropriate.", "Yeah. Make a joke at the expense of a gay person *with no gay people in the room* and it would probably be right to call them out on them. But these are clearly friends and this falls within bounds of their friendship, so no one else should be upset on their behalf.", "Can you guarantee that's still true? They may be a little more sensitive now.", "I evaluated this story as NTA and I stand by that, but I do have to come in an point out that this logic you're using here is still flawed. I have met anti-black black people and homophobic gays. Very much the \"pick me\" type. Your joke was not homophobic, because it factually wasn't, not because your gay friends were okay with it.", "Some people think all humor of that sort is at best tasteless regardless of who it's aimed at.\n\nHonestly, I don't think I'd ever make a joke like that myself, and I'd be irritated if someone joked with me that way, *but*, I also wouldn't have acted like them in a game of truth-or-dare (which, as it happens, I've never played).\n\nPeople differ.", "Bc it can be offensive if said to the wrong person. Not that those guys are gonna be offended. Maybe they are cool with it. But there is the situation with a fine line between funny and bad. It\u2019s like stand up comedy. It\u2019s very risky. It\u2019s like a white person saying the n word to a friend. If it\u2019s a friend, doesn\u2019t matter. If it\u2019s not, then it\u2019s trouble.", "okay, thank you", "I see what you\u2019re trying to say but I don\u2019t think that joke went anywhere near that territory at all?? Literally the only reason that the joke (assuming no hidden information) could be construed as homophobic is because it\u2019s two guys. Swap out Drew for Dana and it\u2019s the exact same joke pretty much. Not to say that people can\u2019t be offended still because they don\u2019t like dirty jokes but that\u2019s a separate thing."]}
