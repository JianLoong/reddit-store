He said he wasn\u2019t buying a new bed and it would be no different than sleeping in a hotel bed. So I told him I wasn\u2019t moving in until he buys a new bed and he said I was being \u201cchildish\u201d \u201cunreasonable\u201d and I was \u201cnitpicking\u201d. \n\nI do think my feelings are valid but maybe he\u2019s right and I am being a little unreasonable and nitpicking.

Unless you are paying for it, or your boyfriend is gracious enough to split it with you, then it\u2019s an unreasonable expectation.

Personalized wall art, new throw pillows to change up a color scheme, a stylish new duvet cover; those are reasonable accommodations to ensure someone feels at home. A brand spanking new mattress (that doesn\u2019t have a tainted sex aura permeating through the bedding) is not a cheap buy and is supposed to be a once every ten years(?) or so purchase. Just the research alone to make sure you don\u2019t end up with an aching back or stiff hips is a pain in the ass.\n\nI think your view on the mattress (and indirectly, sex) is stupid but YTA solely because of the suggestion HE buys y\u2019all the new bed/mattress.", "YTA at best new sheets should be fine.

It was one thing when he lived without me and I was was just visiting his house but had my own bed to go to.
