The other comments saying you need to get rid of the couch and car bc likely someone had sex on it is dumb. A bed is very different from those things. A bed you lay on for hours at a time and get sweaty while you sleep and it\u2019s the most logical one to have sex on. You also don\u2019t put on specific clothes to sit on the couch or drive a car, but you would change into PJ\u2019s or different sleep clothes to use a bed.

He asked what you needed and you told him. Nothing wrong with that. \n\nThat said, mattresses aren't exactly cheap so you should be willing, and have offered, to pay half. If you can't afford to pay half that's a problem but if you aren't willing to pay half then YTA. \n\nHowever, his reaction to your request is a huge red flag. I would seriously consider if this is the right idea at this time. I feel that you may need a bit more time letting the relationship develop before you both make a commitment like this.
