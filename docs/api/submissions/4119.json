Inside the box? We didn't exactly know what we were looking at at first, the items looked old and some writing was in German. So I asked again, was it his lock box.\n\nMy husband admitted the things inside belonged to his grandfather who was \u201ca soldier \u201d. Immediately I knew what he meant. He admitted later that day his grandfather was a Nazi. And from the writings in the journal, appeared to be proud one.\n\nMy son is named after a Nazi. WIBTA if I changed his name?

Changing it now would be a hell of an adjustment and it would require an explanation, and you would have to find the best way to explain... That.\n\nOn top of that you say that the name has been passed down for generations for 150+ years. That means the name has not only been associated with Nazism, it has a history before and after that incident.\n\nYou have every right to be upset that your husband's Nazi history was kept hidden from you (especially since the grandfather was a \"proud\" Nazi) and that needs some explanation and a big discussion about openness and honesty.\n\nHowever to basically say \"this name is bad because one german person had the same name and was a Nazi\" and to take away the identity your son has (who is his own person, free from that identity) would be IMHO wrong.\n\nThere are exceptions of course... If you tell me your kid is name Adolf I would totally change that name.", "YTA. Your son is not \"named after a Nazi\". All the men in your husband's family have had this name. Nazi grandfather is neither the first nor the last man to have the family name.", "Try explaining this to a 7 year old. \u2018You can\u2019t have your name anymore because your Nazi great grandfather was named that too. \n\nAnd then try to explain it to all of his friends, teachers, etc. \u2018oh we changed his name\u2019? \n\nYWBTA \n\nIf the name goes back more than 150 years, it doesn\u2019t originate at all with anything Nazi related.", "German person here, in case that matters: \n\nSo, first off all I think it probably wouldn\u2019t serve your son any good to change his name. He is seven years old, not seven months. He has some form of connection to his name already, so I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea to change it.\n\nAlso, 150+ years of tradition literally traces back to a time where Germany (as in the state of Germany) wasn\u2019t even a thing. Our first national state was founded in 1871, so it\u2019s probably as reasonable to claim that your son is named after a proud royalist, liberal fighter against Napoleon of what have you. If your son was named after that specific grandfather I would understand, but with a line that long I kinda thing it looses that. Also, probably all German names were carried by proud Nazis\u2026 sadly.\n\nI would make one exemption though: If this is a name known by the general public to be linked to the Nazis, so Adolf for sure and maybe also Hermann, Josef, Heinrich and Amon. having your kid share a name with a simple Wehrmacht soldier is one thing, even though I absolutely don\u2019t want to deny or diminish the crimes committed by the Wehrmacht. However, I feel like there is a difference between sharing a name with that one guy and sharing a name with the heads of the organization. \n\nHowever, I absolutely understand how you feel. I personally am not that much into family history, but one of my greatest shames is that my very own great-grandfather was a very proud Nazi as well. Even though he (as far as I know) didn\u2019t commit any crimes against humanity, I still think he was a gradeA-Asshole just by having that opinion. Luckily, I never got to meet him. \n\nBut in the end, I think what matters most of all is your son. He already formed an identity around his name, he knows *who* he is by this name. Changing it now, especially when it\u2019s not his own wish, probably won\u2019t do him any good. So while I very much understand this bad feeling it leaves in your mouth, I think you WBTA to your son.", "Soft YTA. I don\u2019t blame you for feeling the way you do, but unless his family still hold those sort of beliefs or the name is associated with someone easily identifiable as a war criminal that could negatively impact your son by association (ex- goering, himmler, mengele etc etc) then I think it\u2019s a bit overload to change the name. Doing that would also likely cause a huge amount of issues and drama for you and your husband with his family. That\u2019s not even taking into consideration the effect it would have on your son at school. How are you planning on explaining that one away to everyone? I think that telling everyone your son is descended from and named after a nazi would have a pretty bad effect on him and draw negative light to your family. People in this world are judge mental AH, ESPECIALLY kids if they ever got ahold of that info. \n\nI think the best way to go is to educate your son once he\u2019s old enough about the family history/name and then let him make that decision himself. He may not care or maybe he will but I think it\u2019s better for it to be his choice.", "YTA\n\nIt's a family name going back 150 years, that means he's actually named for someone in the 1870s, during the era of Bismark. Nothing excuses the Nazis, and family members of that era should rightly be named and shamed for their evil, but there are people with the name before and after Hitler's regime, and you'll be hard pressed to find ***any*** western european name not connected to some nazi or other.\n\nEdit: unless they ***all*** are nazis, including your husband, FIL, etc. That would 100% be grounds to change the name and get a divorce.", "INFO: Your son is old enough to understand and would be the one impacted by this. Have you asked his thoughts?", "YWBTA for changing his name The name is 150+ years old, that takes precedent over one person being named that way being a nazi. You are an AH already for breaking into a locked box that is not yours, constantly pushing the boundaries of your husband and his family, and for shaming him on the internet for something he is CLEARLY already ashamed of and didn't feel comfortable letting you know for this very reason.", "YTA.  Your kid is seven.  At this point, it\u2019s *his* name unless *he* decides he wants to change it - and no, you do not get to pressure him into that because you think it\u2019s been irrevocably tainted by the *one* asshole he shares it with.  Unless you\u2019re concerned your husband didn\u2019t elaborate on the family history because he shares Grandpa\u2019s beliefs, in which case you have *much* bigger problems to attend to than a name.", "YWBTA because your son is 7, that's his name at that point. If he was 7 months, I would say go for it. But I don't like the idea that your husband knew and hid the truth from you. He knew the association of the name and didn't care to do something about the tradition.", "Depends on the name honestly. Was is someone popular? Is it a fairly common German name or something very special? Tell us, the Germans in this sub can tell you. \n\nIf it's just a regular name that runs in your husband's family, you shouldn't rename your son. He is 7 already, it's his name and his identity. If course your husband and his family are the assholes for not telling you 8 years ago ....", "Unless it\u2019s Adolf, i would keep it. It\u2019s just a name and he\u2019s already 7 years old.", "\nYour husband is not a Nazi, I assume, or you would a) have mentioned it b)voluntarily marry a nazi and not make a post about discovering this. \n\nYour son is not a Nazi, either. He doesn't need to be made to feel like a villain over his great grandfather's history or be ashamed of his name. \n\nI'm sure it is a shock, but the great grandfather's name didn't make him a Nazi, and it won't make your son anything he does not choose to become, either. Also, it's both your child, and clearly offends your husband quite a bit that you want to make this change. \n\nYWBTA the child is 7 and there is no way to address this without dragging him through some sordid family history.", "So, there were plenty of other people in the family that had this name before WWII. Also, if you want to get down to it, tons of people have names with less savory characters in history. Doesn't mean you're glorifying their crappy actions.", "The kid's 7 and is already familiar with the name, so I think you should keep it. It would be a mess to change it and then have to explain (truthfully or not) to everyone why you did it.  I do think when your son is at a proper age and educated enough that you two should not hide this fact about his great-grandfather since that's just as much of his family history as anything else.  Your husband is not the only German American who has to deal with this reality, so it is what it is. But, that's another conversation.  For this issue, YWBTA.", "YWBTA. \n\nUnless the name is Adolf, it\u2019s a little late to be changing a child\u2019s name against the child\u2019s wishes. Have you spoken to your son about this or would it be a unilateral decision without your husbands and sons consent?", "YTA. It\u2019s a name. Unless his name is Adolf (which I am certain it\u2019s not), then the name is perfectly fine to use. Your son will be able to create his own identity and if *he* wants to change his name later, so be it. You don\u2019t want him to be associated with a Nazi, and that\u2019s fine, but he should be the one to decide whether or not he wants to change his name. Your post also says that your husband\u2019s middle name is the same as your son. Think of it more as you named your son after your husband. Your mindset impacts things more than you think.", "YWBTA for the fact your son is 7. How exactly do you expect it not to completely impact his life, school, friendships, etc who all know and deal with him by his current name.\n\nIt would also be rude to do it at that age, as your son is old enough to know and keep his own name, and I imagine it would be a far more damaging and awkward conversation explaining the family history.\n\nAnd honestly, while that is a repugnant moment in history, it's also your HUSBAND'S own middle name. It would be destructive and cruel to have your son's name be changed for the consequences to their relationship.", "YWBTA. Not here to stick up for Nazis! That being said? Almost everyone who lived in Germany in the 1930s and 40s became a Nazi. I don't believe your son received the family name because your husband is so very proud of the Nazi origins of the name. It's your son's name. He's not seven weeks or seven months. He's seven years old. I would, if I were you, try to see this situation with more nuance.", "Super surprised the conversation of \"you're German, Germany had nazis\" hasn't come up before now. They were so ashamed of the grandfather they kept his shit locked in a box that no one talked about. Not exactly proud nazi behavior. \n\nYTA. The kids not named after a nazi. He's named after all the other men in the family including your husband's middle name.", "YTA\n\nYour kid is 7, you really want to change his name???\n\nAs a Jew, I assure you, we don\u2019t need you to fall on your sword for the cause.", "YTA for wanting to rename a SEVEN YEAR OLD.", "YWBTA. Your son is a living, breathing person who has had a name for 7 years. It would absolutely be inappropriate to change his name. Would you tell him he's named after a nazi?\n\nYour husband is TA here. He should've told you, but I'm sure he's not honoring his grandfather, they're honoring all the men who came before him.\n\nDefinitely let your son know the history when he is old enough so he doesn't make the same mistake. He can change his name when he's old enough to make the decision himself.", "YWBTA just because he's already old enough to know and identify as that name.  It should be his decision to change it.  There are 5 generations of Bob's (fathers/sons) in my family.  One of those Bob's was an abusive asshole, the other four Bob's were great.  Should we stop using the name Bob?  (To clarify, it was Bob #2 that was the AH)\n\nAlso the breaking your husbands trust by having your Dad break into it?  That's not something that happens in healthy marriages.", "There were a lot of Nazis. If Germans threw out every name that belonged to a proud soldier of the 3rd Reich, there'd be a really limited pool to choose from.\n\nYWBTA if you went ahead and changed your son's name, but you're no wrong to be upset that they hid this history from you.", "Info: why didn't you know about this beforehand? Surely you researched the name before giving it to your son? How do you know his grandfather was a proud soldier from his writings when it seems like you can't even read German?", "YTA, it's your son's name now. Everyone was involved in the war, your husband's relatives lived in Germany during the war, it's not a longshot they were nazis. But it was a family name long before that, it's a family name, not a nazi name.", "So yes you are the AH. You're e you changing your 7 year olds name. He's also not technically named after a Nazi you said it yourself that this goes back  at least 150 years so you're just wrong", "Jumping in to make sure you get the lockbox items to a historian. So much can be learned about the regime from minor family communications, and I\u2019m sure they\u2019d enjoy seeing it or be able to use it for some useful research.\n\nBut also YWBTA for changing the name (as many a commenter has said, it\u2019s probably not a big association unless it\u2019s \u201cadolf\u201d). See if a nickname that is appropriate for class/the workplace sticks -  if not oh well. Let him change his name when he is older if he finds it a big deal.", "YTA. It\u2019s a family name that happened to be used once in the middle of a generational line by someone wicked. Now you want to make some performative act and completely confuse your child \n\nYou\u2019re also the arsehole for getting your father to break the lock after your husband already made it very clear that what was in the box was none of your business. Way to stomp on boundaries.", "So he has been keeping his nazi grandfathers memorabilia? I would also have a problem with his parent who was so enamored by his own evil parent that they would give him their name .

Have you asked him why he\u2019s keep evil grandfathers memorabilia?", "If the name goes back 150+, plenty of people have had that name if your husband\u2019s family that weren\u2019t Nazis. The name has been a family tradition before the Nazi party was even formed. \n\nI don\u2019t understand how changing your son\u2019s name at 7 is in any way a good idea. Does he even want to change his name? How are you gonna explain to him why? What is he gonna tell people when they ask why he changed it?\n\n\nYTA.", "YTA. Unless the name is literally Nazi, don't change it.", "How would changing his name alter the fact that his great grandfather was a Nazi?  It's just a name and it honors the entire family line and not just one person.  By your logic, the family/last name needs changed too.  I suspect most people would be embarrassed by some of their ancestors.\n\nYWBTA", "YWBTA - can you even change his name without your husband\u2019s consent, it sounds like he doesn\u2019t want to change it.\n\nYou said other family members have had this name, not just the grandfather, one person in the family with the name was bad, why are you focusing so much on that one person, what about the others who weren\u2019t?", "Yes YWBTA lol the name doesn't only belong the the 1 nazi in his line it seems to be a much older family name. Now if hubby espoused similar beliefs we might have a different conversation", "Yes, you would be. He\u2019s 7 years old, not 7 months. You can\u2019t just change a child\u2019s name because you\u2019re not comfortable with someone else having the name of a former Nazi.", "YTA sorry. As long as your son's name isn't \"Adolf\" there are thousands (millions?) of people with the same name.", "YTA. No matter where it came from, it's his name. His identity. He now gives the name a new legacy and meaning. Explain to him one day where the name came from.

He\u2019s 7, how\u2019s he going to feel about changing his name.\n\nHonestly, it seems like that ship has sailed", "Info: is it your son\u2019s first or middle name? Would he be able to understand the discussion around the name to make a choice himself? If not, I\u2019d say leave it for now until he gets older. He may want to change it, he may not. I understand not wanting a name associated with a Nazi, but since there are other family members with the name, it\u2019s not just associated with the one person. Maybe do some genealogy research about the other relatives and find the good about them.", "So your husbands German family didn\u2019t want to tell you about his grandparents and you never connected the dots to figure out what that means?

I mean you\u2019re not necessarily an asshole, just very very na\u00efve.", "So your husband asked you to leave it alone, and you brought it to your father to open? I feel like that's a huge breach and you should have at least kept questioning him on the matter\n\n\nBut you also say the naming tradition goes back 150+ years meaning long before the Nazi's as long as he's not named Adolf or some obviously high ranked Nazi name, then you can just consider it a german name that had some marring by the Nazi's \n\n\nAlso the kids 7 how confusing and uprooting do you think it would be to change your name at 7, I think soft YTA if you really insist on the name change but HUGE YTA for breaking into your husband's private belongings behind his back", "Ask your son how he feels about you changing his name.", "YTA\n\nIf your son is not named \"Adolf\", you are blowing this waaay too much.", "YWBTA \n\nIt's your son that puts the meaning into the name now, not some dead Nazi, your living breathing son.

To put it in perspective, most certainly any older then 50yo german name was a name to a nazi once.\n\n Im pretty sure there were Nazis who had the same name as my mother, my grandparents, probably even me.

Most german names and surnames were worn by people who were Nazis. Bc back then, people did not have a choice. Germans either were Nazis or struggled with being outcasts and supervised or needing to flee or were seen as enemies by Nazis. \n\nYour husbands family tradition was not started by a Nazis, it just was kept through a dark time, thats not a reason to stop it. \nYou would not say \"every german who has a name which belonged to someone in the NSDAP or german army in WW2 needs to change their name and all those names need to be blacklisted\", would you?

If your husband's family wanted to keep the name and denounce nazism, they could have. If your husband's family wanted to pretend their nazi ancestor didn't exist- they have to have stopped using the name.
