That should be an agreement between the ones who are in charge, meaning adults, and maybe even kids if they're old enough.\n\nKeeping a space \"for show\" is ridiculous. Moreover, the people she's showing it to are saying that too. So, she's keeping a space for people to tell her she's using it wrong.", "NTA - Lay on that couch eating chips and stare at her.", "NTA. It\u2019s absolutely ridiculous to have a whole room in a house to be totally unused. I can\u2019t even fathom why a person would want that. What is her reasoning?", "NTA. Is she putting plastic covers on the sofa seats too?  There's no reason to have \"formal\" living rooms anymore especially if there's no real space to do any actual living in. She doesn't get to have the whole say in what goes on in a house that other people live in and pay for too.", "NTA - I grew up with a living room we essentially never used, but yelling at you for using it is over the top and she should be open to communicating like an adult about the room", "NTA. Use your stuff. Enjoy your house. My grandma used to forbid us from going in certain rooms in her house. Everything was wrapped in plastic. Now she\u2019s gone and the furniture is still here wrapped in plastic. Nobody ever enjoyed it.", "NTA. I would figure out how to make the \u201codd\u201d room the most fun room in the house for you and the kids and tell her she can\u2019t use it. (jk..sort of) Honestly though, I wouldn\u2019t continue living with someone that throws temper tantrums about sitting on a couch.

You could even try posting to r/DesignMyRoom", "Use all the rooms!!! \n\nMy parents had a \u201creception room\u201d that no one was allowed in. Plastic covers on all the furniture & fabric covers on all the tables. I don\u2019t recall anyone ever using the decanters or crystal glasses on the bar cart. It was only used for \u201ccompany\u201d.... None of our family was ever in that room (unless it was an event). We were always in the living room or kitchen. Everything in that room was sold at an estate sale after they moved. It was sad ...

That sounds like the kinda shit my grandmother would do lol", "There was a house in the local newspaper that went up for sale after the elderly couple that owned it passed away.. It was like a time capsule from the 60s. They had spent all their time in the basement and never used the actual house except on holidays. All the furniture was covered in plastic, in pristine condition. This was around 2006 I read this article. Basically everything was the same as when they had bought and furnished the house and they had raised the whole family in the basement.\nThis reminds me of that.

Wait till all is calm, have a family meeting and discuss calmly.. Recommendation: eat beforehand to reduce the chances of hangry screaming.", "Nta. Designating rooms in the home you live in is a decision BOTH of you have a say in. Unless the house is so absurdly large with dozens of extra rooms and unused spaces with a family of four it makes no sense to have a room \"just for show\" and being relegated to using rooms that aren't as functional for your actual lives.", "NTA \nmy grandparents generation (born 1920s) was all about this.  It was, as far as I could tell, a reaction to extreme poverty growing up (all were Immigrants) , and possibly also related to culture/customs in \"the old world\".   Your gf could honestly just be trying trying to do as she was raised, but that doesn't make you an AH for asserting yourself in your own house.  If she wants an old English manor full of old un used rooms, as a symbol of status, that's a different issue. This is a home for multiple people, not a Victorian novel about propriety among the upper classes.", "NTA. There is a conversation that could be had here about what\u2019s going through her mind, whether there\u2019s some cultural or family baggage that makes her feel this is necessary, etc\u2026but if she just screams at you and the children when you try to talk about it, I\u2019m not sure that can happen or if you should stay in this relationship much longer.", "Honestly? NTA for not wanting to get screamed at, regardless of the issue.", "Wait so the room she wants you guys to use has no tv, but the \u201cjust for show\u201d room does?", "NTA. It's absurd to not be allowed to use a room in a home you pay to live in, and it is completely unacceptable for her to scream at you and her kids for ANY reason. This is a hill to die on before she gets worse.", "NTA and you need to tell her if she wants a guest room like that she needs to use the one that is essentially unusable for most family purposes. Or just say no and continue using it at will and ignore her.", "NTA. Isn\u2019t that something people worried about in the 80\u2019s and why they kept plastic on their sofa, because they didn\u2019t want people denting/staining it?
