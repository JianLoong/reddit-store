There is no \"but\" there, you had zero business doing that and the fact that you still don't realize how wrong you are would definitely be a reason for him to just move on.", "\nYTA him asking for you to keep it to yourself would\u2019ve been the perfect moment to mention that you already uploaded it and if he wants you to take it down.\n\nHe TOLD you to keep it between you guys, so you don\u2019t \u201cthink he\u2019s joking\u201d, why would you anyways I don\u2019t see where or how that could be funny. Did you laugh?\n\nBesides you don\u2019t just post pictures and videos of people online especially about stuff they\u2019re uncomfortable with.

Afterwards, I uploaded the song on my FB, and it got a few positive comments from our friends. After the show, when I was playing back the recording to John (but before I uploaded it on FB), he flinched a little and he told me \"you'd better keep this just between us\". I thought he was joking when he said that, and I also thought it was weird, because it wasn't between us in the first place...\n\nSo you uploaded a video of your boyfriend and his band mates on to your social media without their consent or approval. And after your boyfriend said he'd like to keep it private you didn't take it down because according to you you thought it was a joke and \"he's adorable like that\".  So, you are also inconsiderate.\n\n>I heard John stomp up to my room and he opened the door very abruptly, and he was kinda spazzing out because he found out that I uploaded the video of him singing online! He was freaking out in the cutest way possible, and my first reaction was to go like \"awww relax!\" but he told me that it isn't funny, and he made me delete the video and he watched me delete it.\n\nI have no idea why this man is wasting his time with someone as inconsiderate and dismissive as you. You really need to grow up and learn to respect your partner. Not everything is cute and adorable, especially if you are disregarding your partner's feelings.", "YTA. Just because your current crush is comfortable(ish) singing in front of strangers, that doesn't give you the right to post video of him online.

Stop treating him like that - you need to grow up.", ">he flinched a little and he told me \"you'd better keep this just between us\".\n\nAnd you did not feel that telling him you already shared it didn't seem appropriate?\n\n>He was freaking out in the cutest way possible, and my first reaction was to go like \"awww relax!\"\n\nAnd you felt that minimizing his feelings was appropriate?\n\n>he wanted to break up with me.\n\nWell, he made a valid request and you chose to hide from him that you had already shared the video, never volunteered to take it down, and mocked his feelings.\n\n>I didn't know it was such a huge deal to him!\n\nIf only he had communicated that he wanted this video kept private.\n\nYTA\n\nEDIT\n\n>ETA that when I played back the recording to him, this was after the show, but BEFORE I uploaded it on Facebook\n\nYour edit makes the story worse and  kills your credibility.   \n\n\nYTA, but you knew that when you added the edit.", "Yes, YTA \n\nYou don't post online videos or photos of other people without their consent, that's Net etiquette 101, and ESPECIALLY you don't post when they told you not.", "YTA. I understand posting something without realizing it would be a problem but as soon as he said to keep it between you, you should have immediately deleted the video and apologized. Instead, you left it up until he saw it then had the nerve to tell him to \u201crelax\u201d which is very invalidating of his feelings. I\u2019d want to break up with you too.", "YTA; your descriptions of his fear being cute are honestly nauseating.", "YTA. You come across as patronizing and dismissive of your boyfriend's boundaries and feelings. If you thought he was joking, you could've asked to clarify.

You saying \"aww relax\" about something he doesnt want shows him that you dont care about his feelings", "Yta. More obsessed with posting stuff on your socials for likes and disregarding his feelings than being a compassionate person. He should have broken up with you. You lack maturity to see your partner as anything more than pet", "YTA and waaay too patronizing. I sincerely hope he dumps your inconsiderate ass.", "YTA he didn\u2019t want you to do that and you did anyway. Take it down and apologize. I would have left you. Getting consent applies to women too.\n\n\u201cAww relax\u201d is gaslighting. Maybe stop being manipulative and abusive.", "YTA, treating your boyfriend like a smol bean is not going to end well", "Yeah\u2026 YTA cuz you didn\u2019t take him serious in the first place. And also legally you were wrong because he first told you not to upload it by saying \u201cits just between us\u201d. Yes he sang in front of a group of people but that doesn\u2019t mean you have the right to share what you filmed when he literally told you to keep it for yourself. And when he came in mad in your room, you didn\u2019t take him serious for the second time. \n\n\n\nBut tbh, if you apologise and take the initiative to take him seriously. He shouldn\u2019t be this dramatic and break up immediately. But it\u2019s his choice. \n\n\n\nI wish you luck girl", "YTA. And the actual reason he likely thought of breaking up with you was he was so angry and felt violated. Very strong reaction but maybe talk to him so you can understand rather then minimise it. Also, your views of him when he\u2019s upset - he\u2019s so cute - is really unsettling. I\u2019d want to break up with someone over that alone. I actually think that\u2019s worse then his first reason. Focusing on how he looks rather then focusing on his pain and distress\u2026", "YTA. No permission, no post.

In this case he specifically asked you not to post it anywhere.  You posted it for you to get attention and you don\u2019t seem to care about his feelings at all. That\u2019s selfish behaviour - don\u2019t be surprised if this relationship doesn\u2019t last long.", "YTA. He asked you not to post it, you did it anyway, you think him being agitated about it is funny, and you used the phrase \"spazzing out\" which is an ableist slur.", "Yes, yta", "YTA, stop talking about him like he's a sweet silly baby whose cute little boundaries don't deserve to be respected.

Why did you do this?   And seriously, did you just describe his less than happy reaction to your overreach here as 'spazzy' and 'freaking out in the cutest way possible'?

I get it from your perspective and I think that the best thing to do when a person has feelings like that is to not only respect their boundaries but gently and consensually try and push those boundaries - long term that is.   \n  \nDon't allow this to tarnish your relationship, be sure to acknowledge his feelings and the fact that you stepped on them a little, apologise and remind him that you wouldn't have done it if you understood the way it would make him feel.

John is a medical student, and the guitarist for a rock band. He usually only plays the guitar, but for one show last month, his band was covering the song \"Anesthetize\" by Porcupine Tree. It's a hard-rocking song that I encourage everybody to listen to - the entire 18 minutes of it - but the final few minutes are soft and soothing, and although John has a very, very limited vocal range, his voice sounds great, and it fits that soft ending perfectly. So his bandmates wanted him to sing the last few minutes, and he reluctantly agreed. He was reluctant because he's a shy singer, and he's a shy person in general. He's adorable like that.\n\n\nSo I attended that particular show, and I recorded the final few minutes of Anesthetize that he sang. Afterwards, I uploaded the song on my FB, and it got a few positive comments from our friends. After the show, when I was playing back the recording to John, he flinched a little and he told me \"you'd better keep this just between us\". I thought he was joking when he said that, and I also thought it was weird, because it wasn't between us in the first place - he sang to a room full of people!\n\nA few days after the concert, John and I were just hanging around in my apartment, and I was just in my room, working remotely on a school assignment. I heard John stomp up to my room and he opened the door very abruptly, and he was kinda spazzing out because he found out that I uploaded the video of him singing online! He was freaking out in the cutest way possible, and my first reaction was to go like \"awww relax!\" but he told me that it isn't funny, and he made me delete the video and he watched me delete it.\n\nWe went out on a date just last night, and John kind of confessed to me that he felt really guilty, because when he was upset about finding the video, he wanted to break up with me. I was so taken aback when he confessed this to me, like I didn't know it was such a huge deal to him!
