My dad was originally embarrassed about not doing more to find her or as if he did not fulfill his obligations towards her, but now they have a wonderful relationship and they talk often and send cards.\n\nIt was even more meaningful to me, as my brother and I have gone no-contact since he and his wife are toxic, deplorable human beings.  I felt like I gained a sister to replace \"losing\" the awful brother.\n\nI say all this to say that I totally get why you wouldn't want to have a relationship with your \"son\" in a similar way to how the bio-mom above didn't want to go down that path with my new sibling.  At the same time, I see how great an impact it's had on my dad and my family, and me for that matter.\n\nI'm going to say NTA but there is part of me hoping that at some point you'll change your mind on the situation and that it will be as fruitful for you as the new sibling has been for us.", "NTA but it sounds like you and this child\u2019s parents never made a plan on how to speak of you. That\u2019s on all three of you not the child. This kid, 19 yo, may just need or want health information. In all honesty, it would be really great of you to provide this, even by paper not having to meet him. As an adopted person, that missing health info is all kinds of problematic. But he also may want to meet you as his moms made that seem like a possibility. Meeting you doesn\u2019t have to mean allowing him in your life. But it\u2019s not AH of you to say no either as there was never any intent of you being in his life. But I also caution you that this kid is 19 and you have teen daughters, and there are stories of unintentional incest in situations like these so take some time to decide if there is anything you would share and to what extent", "CB CBc", "\u0181", "NTA.", "NTA. If this was done correctly, via a donor bank not exploiting a young adult (18 or in their 20s\u2026 can\u2019t tell if you meant senior year of HS to college) you\u2019d be an anonymous donor and they have no recourse. Your wife knows. While genetically he is your son, he is a stranger so I understand the fear for your daughters. Albeit I find it a little unfounded. You owe them nothing.", "NTA", "NTA. Well, maybe your 18 yo self was an Ah for not getting paperwork that states it is a closed donation and they were not to disclose your identity and if they did they could be sued.", "NTA for not wanting to meet the guy. You never intended to be in his life, so be it.\n\nBut please, don't use your daughter as an excuse. You don't have to meet at your house, you don't even have to meet more that once; after the curiosity is satisfied. And I would be really surprised you never invited male strangers to your house (the friend of a friend you barely met).", "NTA. Plenty of sperm donors do not agree to ever share their contact info. Consider writing up a comprehensive medical history for your side so he at least has that for himself and future kids. But otherwise you don't have to do anything.", "NTA as long as your wife knows and your kids know or will be told that they have a biological sibling out there because in the world of DNA kits odds are good they will find out.", "NTA\n... You contributed when you were young and stupid. This is not your responsibility.", "YTA. Being a sperm donor makes you no less the child\u2019s father. It doesn\u2019t matter that you signed your rights away. You created this person, you still have a responsibility towards him.", "NTA. It's your right to meet them or not.\n\nThey're TA for threatening to tell your wife! Honestly.", "While I think you are a bit ridiculous to be worried about this kid with your daughters, I also think you have no obligation to meet with him. You aren't a deadbeat dad - you are literally a down donor. You have shown to that others could be a parent.", "> But i dont think im the asshole because i dont even know this kid\u2019s first name or what he looks like or acts or anything. And he\u2019s at least 19 going on 20 i have teen age kids in my house I don\u2019t trust a random guy in the house with my daughters! Let alone be around them.\n\nWhat on earth are you talking about? The child you helped create would like to meet you now that he's an adult. Why is your immediate response to view him as a danger to your daughters' safety? What do you think is going to happen? What do you think is being asked of you? You have the option to meet him at a neutral location and actually *get to know him* before introducing him to anyone else in your life, if you decide you want to do that.\n\nYou can choose to deny his request to meet, NAH for that, but your reasoning is bizarre and suggests you're flailing for reasons to reject this out of fear or shame. More importantly, *talk to a lawyer* and find out whether whatever you signed - if you did sign anything - actually means, because my understanding is that arrangements like this often carry far less legal force than the people making them like to imagine. It'll do you no good to set a hostile tone here and then find out that technically you're on the hook for child support or something.", "NTA", "YTA- you don\u2019t get to make a kid and then refuse to have anything to do with him without being TA. You decided to put yourself in this position. He didn\u2019t get to choose.", "Nah", "Thank you.", "\u201cBiology doesn\u2019t equal family.\u201d\n\nThis can\u2019t be upvoted enough.", "imo you can sign away rights but you owe that child biological and medical information", "Honestly my list of enemies is largely comprised of immediate blood relatives.", "This is the way", "exactly! like ofc op doesnt have to but it'd be a very kind gesture to him", "OP this sounds like a smart idea. Kids questions get answered. He'll know whatever he needs to about family medical stuff that could potentially affect him later in life. You don't have to meet him or be a \"dad\" to him, just answering his curiosities so you can both move forward. You'll know you helped make this kids life easier and he'll be less likely to try to keep contacting you in future and he wont have sleepiness nights wondering about you or later on in life won't be wondering if some illness he's dealing with is genetic or not.", "This. NTA but it\u2019s probably good to know his name and what he looks like at least.", "Yes, was thinking this too", "I thought that was weird and shitty too.", "I'm glad you pointed that out about him being a threat to his daughters.", "And it's not like step one is going to be him moving in, there's no reason he needs to be around the daughters or in their home the first time they meet.\n\n(Also, it's really weird to think your biological son is inherently a threat by being a man, the nature part of that equation is 100% on OP)", "Exactly, OP's kids meet strangers everyday.   He's acting like this kid is a criminal", "I don't think he signed anything, and that's part of the problem with informal, black market sperm donation.", "Yeah a medical history might be helpful for him as well", "This could mean Everything to him.", "Yes, please do it for HIM.  It doesn't need to be anywhere near your home.  There are unlimited public areas you can meet.  He needs this.", "Doesnt sound like a real donor. Sounds like he did it in a cup and they used it. If medical stuff was invovled his wouldnt be allowed.", "exactly this. a sperm donor is an insult to a deadbeat dad for a reason-- it is not someone who has any interest in being a parent to whatever child comes of it.", "This. I want to be on OP\u2019s side bc that\u2019s how sperm donation should be but this horror story OP has concocted is weird.", "Kid is 20. In most jurisdictions, child support can't be backdated past the time you file for it, so that ship sailed long since.", "Woah there, agreed OP is NTA but let\u2019s not go acting like this is some weirdness from the kid.  It is very reasonable for the kid to want to meet his biological parent and family.  Op is under no obligation to do so but let\u2019s not act like the kid is in the wrong.", "Sperm donor kid here chiming in to say that you can be as involved as you want, including not at all. However, consider keeping a line of communication open for relevant medical info. I do feel that, if possible, it\u2019s important to loop him in on medical issues that could impact his life.", "So you think his plan is to meet up so he can molest his sisters? Seriously YTA for that alone. Not wanting to be a father to him is one thing but they are his sisters no matter what you think or want. To say a random man cant be around them, he is their brother", "Which the child can get in some form of correspondence without meeting the donor. Or he can have genetic testing for common hereditary conditions.", "You mean his mother's have that responsibility.  He does not owe the kid a single thing.  If the mothers didn't get that info before\u2026Sounds like a them problem.", ">there's no reason he needs to be around the daughters or in their home the first time they meet.\n\nFully agree. My biological father did this the very first night we met...he took me to meet my siblings, grandparents, and other family. It was frankly overwhelming and contributed quite a bit to our relationship not working out in the end.", "Strangers don't expect you to welcome them into your home like a long lost son.", "exactly! it just says that his son wants to meet him, not live with him. why in particular would he even meet ops daughters and why would he even hit on them knowing yk they are literally genetically related?", "I'm an idiot I don't know how I missed that part.", "This.", "I didn\u2019t say he was? Just it seems weird to me that they\u2019d reach out at this point in time after years of no contact.", "Just because some one is related to you does not mean they should immediately be trusted. They have e never even met each other so yes he is some random guy. Also just because its probably not his plan doesn't mean it won't happen. Most abuse involves the abuser being blood related or family.", "He is not their brother. He is a stranger.", "Majority of abuse is done by family members- statistically speaking", "I thought this too. Not sure why you're getting down voted. Guess I'm taking a chance agreeing with you.", "Genetic testing can only go so far lol and that can be expensive. If you don't want to ever have the possibility of being contacted then don't donate DNA", "I uh\n\nThe sperm is still his biological sperm so yes he does owe biological and medical information", "Is that his expectation? JFC, some of you have no empathy at all. Can you imagine being adopted or the product of egg/sperm donation?", ">\tWhat possible outcome could your biological  son want? What is he hoping to gain from talking to you? Clearly you don\u2019t want a relationship with this kid. You didn\u2019t even want a kid; you wanted to get paid for your sperm which is exactly what you did. It\u2019s done.\n\nMaybe he wants to know his family medical history.  Or maybe he wants a relationship with people who share his dna.  Neither or those are unreasonable things yet you clearly phrase it like bio father should be skeptical.\n\nFrankly while OP owes him nothing, you and he are incredibly naive.  This is not a simple transaction.  A human life resulted from it and humans are naturally curious.  \n\nI wasn\u2019t going to nit pick but the ops first fear of this being what this person would do to his teenage daughters he is biologically related to is also fucking creepy as shit and feels like projection.", "It's not that weird. The parents knowing he didn't want to be involved could have said wait til you're a certain age and then we can see if he's interested or something to that effect. Not everyone is always interested right away either. I personally never reached out to mine but it wasn't until my parents got me the ancestry DNA test for Christmas one year that I actually decided to go out of my way to learn anything, and that was when I was 29.", "You really think it\u2019s weird that this kid would reach out to his biological father now that he\u2019s an adult? I think it would be weird if he didn\u2019t have questions.", "Thank you! That's very true that he's a stranger and yes most abuse victims know their abuser or are related to them", "But as has been pointed out he's not family. He's a stranger.\n\nI fully support OP in that he doesn't have to meet or even get to know the kid, he is NTA there, but his excuse that he doesn't trust him around his daughters is one of the poorest excuses ever.\n\nDoes he think that this kid's only reason to want to get close to his biological family is because he learned he has a bio sister and he is just that desperate to live out his deeply hidden Oedipus complex?", "God forbid someone be wary of strangers around their children lmao", "Maybe it's not the fault of the donor, but of the people getting the donation? He says he was a senior, so I assume (and hope) he was in college and desperate for money and maybe didn't think about the long-term consequences of this particular wank.\n\nI don't know anything about the donation process, but presumably if you donate via a bank, you have to provide medical background information. \n\nBut if you want to get your sauce direct from the source without getting a medical background, then you make the decision to skip that step and run the risk of the child having unknown medical issues.", "i absolutely get what you\u2019re saying, but there is a difference between getting medical information that could be relevant and meeting your sperm donor (and his entire family? was that seriously on the table?) and seeming to expect a familial bond. these boundaries are there for a reason, and if they dissolve, people who need a donor will have a harder time finding one.", "And the onus is on the mothers to get that information. They chose to go to a sperm donor", "Not really. You don\u2019t owe anyone your medical information, not even a child.", "His mothers could answer those questions, though.", "First of all, the kid wants to meet his dad. That in no way includes any other people. Second, why would he just be hanging around their house? That wouldn't happen unless they got to know him. I don't think OP needs to meet him but that is a weird thing to say in this context.", "Sperm banks are kinda iffy on obtaining medical information and actually keeping it unfortunately tbh the laws for that stuff are way too lax", "I'm not saying they have to meet but if you genuinely never want to be contacted it's best not to donate because you unfortunately can't 100% prevent it with the state of DNA testing", "So fun fact: medical information changes as time goes on.", "Yes you do when it's something that can be passed down and will impact them what the fuck are you talking about you guys are weird", "His mothers, who were friends of his biological father\u2019s sister? Do you really think that\u2019s an adequate solution for this kid who is wondering about the other biological side of his family?", "i don\u2019t disagree with you. and you\u2019re right that it is very important for the child to have access to that kind of information. \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb", "Cool so he can easily update his cousin to pass along any changes that he deems are medically necessary for the mothers to be aware of.", "So fun fact: when parents choose to use a sperm donor, they are responsible for finding out any important medical info their child may need", "That information could have, and frankly should have been gathered before the child was even conceived. The actual parents of the child should have done their research and made sure they had the appropriate tests done and gathered the appropriate medical information from the donor before deciding on a donor. If they didn't, that's not the donor's problem, he can choose to give that information if he wishes, but by no means is he required to provide that information now that the child is in its 20's.", "Lmao and it\u2019s dumbass people that agree with her. That\u2019s the sick part", "No they don't, get off this soapbox.", "Did you miss where I say changes\n\nJust admit ur the type to be a lazy parent lol", "No you just don't understand the sperm donor doesn't owe the child anything they gave away the rights and gave someone a child that the person wanted"]}
