Of course that's an opinion on morals at that point, which is where we seem to disagree.", "I'm sorry that happened to you and I'm glad you don't.\n\nOP isn't differentiating between the kid and other strangers, I don't see why he should.\n\nHe doesn't want to meet the kid for other reasons as well, let's not pretend like this is his only \"excuse\". As a sperm donor he is also, in my opinion, absolutely not obligated to meet him, ever, so no need for excuses or specific reasons. This isn't what sperm and egg donors sign up for, quite the opposite, actualy.\n\nSeeing someone else experience something traumatic can also cause trauma, especially as a child, so no co-opting needed.\n\nI feel like you're contradicting yourself, but you are absolutely entitled to feel however you feel, so that's ok, no need to further explain", "He's using it as an excuse to explain why he doesn't like strangers around his children.\n\nYou are absolutely right, he knows nothing about this person, that's why he doesn't want them around his children.\n\nJust because you would be fine with it doesn't mean he is in the wrong for not thinking the same as you.", "Did you miss where its the parents responsibility to keep up with them changes?", "The only person suggesting a grandparent would choose one over the other is you. And by all means, have a vasectomy.", "How? By ESP? C'mon, be serious. What you are suggesting means that every parent of a donor-conceived child would have to maintain ongoing contact with the donor, and that's just not realistic.", "\"A new grand child for grand parents is a gift\"\n\nI'm specifically saying that for this situation like OP's, that thinking like that is a nightmare. Op wants nothing to do with the kid. One day he might visit his parents and all of a sudden he's there, that's the situation OP should be terrified of and nip this problem in the bud and tell the mothers he wants nothing to do with their song.\n\n\"The only person suggesting a grandparent would choose one over the other\" It happens more often than you think. Especially to childfree people who came on hard times and had to donate sperm, or women in the 50's who weren't allowed an abortion. Years later, the kid comes back and the donors parents cut them off.\n\n\nFor ops situation, even if he didn't mention his parents, this 100% is the thing I'd be worried about the most. \n\nLess chance for inheritance for his ACTUAL kids, less time for his kids to have actual time with their grandparents, and I don't know how to tell you this, but this isn't a \"suggestion of a possibility\" it's a very real problem that can happen to sperm donors."]}
