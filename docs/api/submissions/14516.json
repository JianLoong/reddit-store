We moved in together in June 2022. He has a son that is with us weekends. \n\nI am a full time college student, and work 4/5 days a week. My schedule is busy, and in between balancing work, school, working out, etc., I am often tired and wake up later than my boyfriend. \n\nIn May 2022, I adopted 2 stray kittens. One of them was 3 months old, and the other was 5 weeks old. It was an expensive situation, and they are indoor only, but it was worth everything! \n\nLast week, I had woken up and was greeted with throw up in the kitchen. One of the cats tends to eat too fast at times. My boyfriend did not clean it up, and when I asked why, he said because they are \u201cmy cats\u201d and I was in charge of caring for them. \n\nA couple of weeks prior, I had made the point that, in retrospect, they are my cats. I paid/pay for all of their vet visits, vaccines, food, litter, and monthly flea treatments. They are also microchipped with my contact information incase they ever escape. I had said this because if we were to break up, the cats would come with me (all of their paperwork has my name on it). My boyfriend chose to not financially contribute and I was fine with that. \n\nApparently this hurt his feelings, and he used that against me by not cleaning up their throw up or litter boxes over the past couple of weeks. \n\nThis is where I may be the A-Hole. I told him since that\u2019s how it\u2019s going to be, I will not be helping him with his child anymore. I will not buy him food, take him out when my boyfriend is working, nor answer when he calls. Since he is not my child, it is not my responsibility to care for him in any way. I often take him on play dates with my younger brother, but I will not do that either. \n\nMy boyfriend called me a \u201cf-cking a-hole\u201d and left the house.

I do care for him and try to help my boyfriend when he asks me too. I was very upset in the moment and acted in word vomit. \n\nEDIT AGAIN: The cats were to be euthanized if not adopted. I brought them in prior to living together. My boyfriend moved in with me because he prior living conditions were poor.

Though. I am a firm believer that everyone needs therapy for everything because having someone to talk it out with is honestly just the most helpful thing there is and would definitely say a time for those conversations for you, but for right now, maybe just start by scheduling this convo and figuring out what would work best for you both.\n\nI wish you both the best of luck and hope that it works out well.

Like what specifically does he do that demonstrates this?", "Listen to me sweetheart. The reason a 30 year old man with a child is dating a 23 year old is because the man, is still a child. You are at a very exciting time in your young life and you shouldn\u2019t waste it with someone like this. Please enjoy college, travel, enjoy your kittens. Please do not waste any more time here.

Personally I would not be with someone who shuffles off his responsibilities to you. He is not a good dad. Why continue your relationship with him??", "NTA\n\nOf course you would take them with you. You take all the responsibility. At 30 he should be more mature. I think you\u2019ve outgrown him.", "NTA. I think your reaction was fair based on his reaction. But at the same, you should ask yourself what kind of relationship do you want to be in? \n\nRight now, you\u2019re both in a very transactional relationship where you equate what you do for each other and keep count of it. That\u2019s not how good relationships work IMO. If this is someone you\u2019re wanting to end up with for good, both of you need to talk and start making decisions about your life together. \n\nIf you want kittens and wanted them to be owned and looked after both of you, you could have involved him or at the very least set reasonable ground rules about them. Nothing wrong with the kittens being in your name, but that doesn\u2019t mean he can\u2019t love them or watch them the same. \n\nSame goes for the child. Also, neither the child or the kittens are a play thing. These are living beings you\u2019re both looking after, if you\u2019re not both willing to put in equal effort, then you need to reevaluate this relationship cause right now it sounds like a business partnership with terms and conditions.", "Does this man contribute to household? \n\nSounds like OP is single handedly running everything.", "Nta FAFO.

The bot can only read the first judgment in the comment.", "Totally agree. Besides, he lives there. Leaving vomit, piss and feces lying around can damage the flooring depending on the type. It can also contribute to lingering odours if he made a habit of this. So yes, he should be helping with this for the sake of home maintenance.\nI would go NTA. I get the point OP was trying to make. One of them may technically be more responsible for the child and pets. But both need to help in order for them to have a functional home and life.", "I gave you an upvote specifically for pointing out the excuses these guys use to move in way too quickly.

Honestly he doesn't really love you the way you think or he wouldn't be leaving you with his kid to go hang out with friends and not help clean up and leave cat vomit on the floor.

Is this how you want to live?", "Don't settle for a partner who is passive aggressive when you make choices that don't serve him, and verbally abusive when facing the repercussions of his own self-serving actions.\n\nNTA.", "Your BF is a jerk.", "NTA. We all know you wouldn't endanger or neglect the child. Your man started it. What I find so odd is that a LOT of the posts on this subreddit about \"pets vs children\" is always such a big age gap. The fact that you are 7 years apart, you're almost of a different generation. But he needs to realize the cats were there before he moved in. When he moved in, they became his cats too (or roommates essentially). \n\nWhile he doesn't necessarily need to clean up their litter or feed them, he still needs to clean up vomit or pee/poop because that affects the actual living space. That has nothing to do with the cats. If his kid is gonna be around, and vomit or waste is found, it's up to whoever finds it to clean it.

You were just being Petty to match his Pettiness.\n\nI think that you should take a look at the situation you have right now. I saw in another comment that the son is 13. You are young and still figuring out life. Are you happy in this relationship? Do you see yourself wanting to be a parental figure to a child who is only 10 years younger than you? Do you want to start a life with a man who doesn't want to take care of vomit on the floor of your shared living space?\n\nThe age difference between the 2 of you isn't too big, but it can also be something to wonder.

You work full-time your student you pay most of the bills you do most of the cleaning and all you've said is sometimes he makes dinner and he totally loves you or whatever? The man can't even be asked to pick up some cat vomit. Seriously what exactly is he contributing to this relationship if you are doing the majority of the work? At this point you're not really his romantic partner are you? You're his mother who lets him sleep with her. I'm sorry to be crass but as a fellow old woman I've seen so many women waste their youth on men like this because they feel sorry for them or try to fix them or think it's only temporary. You think it's a small problem about words you set out of frustration and you're feeling guilty for some reason while everybody else on here sees the bigger picture which is this guy's a leech. It doesn't matter how much he loves you at the end of the day if you're doing 99% of the work that will never freaking change. Think about it. He's living off of you. You work and are a student and are helping with child care and yet he seem to be so extraordinarily busy that he can't even help with that much housework or pick up some cat vomit from the floor. And then you call him out on it and he lashes out on you and throws a tantrum. A 30-year-old man. What you're living right now in the present? Yeah. That's your future. He won't change. Why should he? He lives a very comfortable life right now.", "I was also thinking about the flooring and wondering how young his kiddo is.
