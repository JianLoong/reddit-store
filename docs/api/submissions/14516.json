We moved in together in June 2022. He has a son that is with us weekends. \n\nI am a full time college student, and work 4/5 days a week. My schedule is busy, and in between balancing work, school, working out, etc., I am often tired and wake up later than my boyfriend. \n\nIn May 2022, I adopted 2 stray kittens. One of them was 3 months old, and the other was 5 weeks old. It was an expensive situation, and they are indoor only, but it was worth everything! \n\nLast week, I had woken up and was greeted with throw up in the kitchen. One of the cats tends to eat too fast at times. My boyfriend did not clean it up, and when I asked why, he said because they are \u201cmy cats\u201d and I was in charge of caring for them. \n\nA couple of weeks prior, I had made the point that, in retrospect, they are my cats. I paid/pay for all of their vet visits, vaccines, food, litter, and monthly flea treatments. They are also microchipped with my contact information incase they ever escape. I had said this because if we were to break up, the cats would come with me (all of their paperwork has my name on it). My boyfriend chose to not financially contribute and I was fine with that. \n\nApparently this hurt his feelings, and he used that against me by not cleaning up their throw up or litter boxes over the past couple of weeks. \n\nThis is where I may be the A-Hole. I told him since that\u2019s how it\u2019s going to be, I will not be helping him with his child anymore. I will not buy him food, take him out when my boyfriend is working, nor answer when he calls. Since he is not my child, it is not my responsibility to care for him in any way. I often take him on play dates with my younger brother, but I will not do that either. \n\nMy boyfriend called me a \u201cf-cking a-hole\u201d and left the house.

I only watch after the child when my boyfriend is at work.) \n\nEdit: he very much loves the cats and gives them a lot of attention. \n\nEDIT: I did NOT go through with what I said about his child. I do care for him and try to help my boyfriend when he asks me too. I was very upset in the moment and acted in word vomit. \n\nEDIT AGAIN: The cats were to be euthanized if not adopted. I brought them in prior to living together. My boyfriend moved in with me because he prior living conditions were poor. I do a majority of cleaning and pay a majority of the necessities. \n\nTLDR; boyfriend told me he will not help me with the indoor cats, so i told him i will not help with his child.", "created_utc": 1681181155, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12i5tly/aita_for_telling_my_boyfriend_his_kid_is_not_my/", "score": 148, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

How much of household expenses does he pay? How much of chores does he do?

Though. I am a firm believer that everyone needs therapy for everything because having someone to talk it out with is honestly just the most helpful thing there is and would definitely say a time for those conversations for you, but for right now, maybe just start by scheduling this convo and figuring out what would work best for you both.\n\nI wish you both the best of luck and hope that it works out well.

I feel like you are way better financially than your boyfriend. He is giving major insecure vibes from that. I think you both need to sit down and talk it out", "Ima say ESH, but it sounds like he sucked first. I mean ok the cats aren't his responsibility, fine... petty, but fine. But... isn't the sink communal? If I wanted to be petty like this, I'd maybe not feed and not do the litter. But... I'd clean the sink if they were sick in it....\n\nWhat happened next makes it ESH but that was a low blow from the beginning.", "you are at different stages of life he is looking for a replacement mother/maid for the days he has custody of his kid. Dont forget to live your life before you settle down and have kids or take on other peoples kids ... you shouldnt be stuck in life because you managed to get your s\\*\\*t together", "ESH. Girl, you are 23 in college. Why are you with a man with a child? He definitely isn\u2019t your responsibility. I hope he\u2019s not using you for childcare without paying you!", "I\u2019m fucking 31 and I should show people shit like this when they\u2019re like \u201cwhen are ya gonna get married?!\u201d", "Btw, if your cats eat too fast, buy a cat feeder that is made to slow them down. I bought one that is like a tower with holes in it (kinda like a game) and they have to pry each piece out one maybe to three at a time. The cats love it, because they are \"hunting/playing\" and get a \"prize\" - the food. \n\nFor kitty food pate they have a flat one like a maze, you smash the food in and can't just gulp it down. Both types go in the dishwasher (top shelf).\n\nNTA", ">I know he cares and loves me a lot\n\nOkay but like, how do you know? Like what specifically does he do that demonstrates this?"]}
