I go with her to every convention she\u2019s speaking at and I also love that she started a group\nfor younger girls interested in stem. I support all of her endeavors.\n\nI (26 M) started dating Riley (23 F) six months ago. Riley is in a masters program for astrophysics. My dad is a physics teachers at the local high school. As a result the two of them when together, chat about their interests and ideas for my dads lessons in the future. They get so absorbed into the conversation that they often forget about their surroundings and it can be quite aggravating. I can tell it bothers my mom as well.\n\nThis past Sunday, my parents invited us over for dinner with several of our family members as well. On Friday, I asked Riley if she could stop herself from talking about physics with my dad as my other family will be there and it will look rude. She seemed displeased and said she wasn\u2019t happy because she loves talking to my dad about it but, she understood and wouldn\u2019t do it. Sunday we arrived early to help my mom and dad set up and I asked my dad the same thing I asked Riley. He got very upset and told me that this was his house and I should not have asked Riley to stop herself from bonding with them (my parents) and talking about things they both enjoy. My mom sided with me saying it was obnoxious to hear the two of them blabber. I saw Riley\u2019s expression fall when my mom said this. My dad got more upset and said it wasn\u2019t blabbering. I agree it was a little harsh but at the same time it was true. After dinner during coffee my dad encouraged Riley to share her ideas if she had any and she smiled and said they will talk about it next time. When we left Riley said it hurt that my dad was the one who defended her from my moms comment and not me. I told her although it was harsh, I agree.

I don't think I am imagining you practically doing a happy dance when your mom called their discussions blabber. It is sad that your dad is the only one who stood up for her.", "YTA but I think you're about to get dumped so it won't be an issue.  You and your mother drove her off. You both are rude AHs. Hope you learn from this for your next gf.  Better find someone less bright", "Yta  wow. Just wow. You're a dick. She should date your dad. He seems nice.. and a lot smarter than you..", "Oh no your girlfriend is bonding with your dad over their careers. YTA.", "What an odd thing to be annoyed about. I love it when my bf and my dad go off into their own little dialogue (basketball). I get this overwhelmingly warm sense of family and belonging. \n\n\nYTA.", "YTA: I don\u2019t understand why you\u2019re so pressed over the fact that they talk about it? And the fact that you didn\u2019t defend her when your mom said it was blabbering. \n\nClearly you hurt your GF feelings as well as your dad\u2019s. You shouldn\u2019t get to dictate what they discuss.", "YTA\n\nWhat are the approved topics Riley and your Dad can talk about or would you and your mom prefer they not talk to one another at all?", "That\u2019s a weird way for you to say you want your girlfriend to break up with you", "YTA. Poor Dad and Riley.", "YTA. Why are you and your mom so jealous?", "YTA. I can smell your jealousy through the computer. Get over yourself. That's AWESOME that your dad and girlfriend get along so well. I'd personally be thrilled. Maybe accept the universe doesn't revolve around you, sit, listen, and maybe learn some interesting things from them.", "YTA you and your mom both are.", "YTA, several people wish they had that \"problem\" where their partner got along with their family. Why can't you just talk to your mom while the other two bond?", "YTA. You should be thrilled that your gf and one of your parents have something in common they can bond over. You and mom could be gracious and say something like- ok you two- enough shop talk, the rest of us would like to be able to participate.", "So YTA.  You've told her and your dad not to talk about a topic they both enjoy, she had to listen to your mother say something negative about her and you agreeing with it.  Can't imagine why she's so short with you now /s  You also sound insecure af.", "YTA. Talk to your mother, she's sitting right there.

YTA", "YTA what an insecure dickmove.  Apologize and do better.", "YTA- Your jealous and embarrassed your girlfriend is smarter than you.", "YTA. People are allowed to have interests that you may not be an expert in, and you should allow her to bond with your dad over this. I honestly think it\u2019s really sweet they have this in common and can share it. \n\nMy fianc\u00e9 is an aerospace engineer. Whenever we go to family gatherings he and my gramps (also an engineer) and my dad (another engineer) and my brother (again, engineer) can regularly get pulled into conversations that truly only interest them. Sometimes it\u2019s 2, 3 or all 4 of them. \n\nYou should be able to appreciate your SO having such an interest in something rather than being annoyed that she dare talk about it.", "YTA. Why are you and your mom so weird about this? Multiple conversations can and do happen at a dinner table.", "YTA. So was your mother. \"Blabbering\" because they are interested in a topic and want to talk about it together? How incredibly rude to both your dad and Riley. Do you respect them at all? \n\nYou know there can be more than one conversation going on at a time, right?", "YTA. There are polite and impolite ways to express an opinion. Your mom was being rude and I can imagine how upset and uncomfortable that made your girlfriend feel. It doesn't matter how true you think that comment was - it was still rude and you should have defended your girlfriend. \n\n> I agree it was a little harsh but at the same time it was true.\n\nLet's say your girlfriend was overweight. If your mother told her \"you're fat\", would that make it ok/not rude just because it was true? No. Just because you think something is true (and in this case I don't even agree that it was) doesn't give someone a free pass to be harsh about it.\n\nNot to mention that your girlfriend bonding with your dad shouldn't be bothering you. It just sounds like both you and your mom don't like the fact that you can't understand what your girlfriend and your dad are talking about. Just because you can't understand someone's conversation doesn't mean that they're \"blabbering\".", "YTA.  You and your mom need to grow up.", "YTA- don\u2019t worry, you won\u2019t have to deal with Riley talking about what she enjoys. You\u2019ll be broken up soon, your not at her level and your jealousy is obvious. Its pathetic that you can\u2019t let them have this. I bet you don\u2019t even ask her about the things she loves. \n\nYou and your mommy can be the only one having something to say\u2026", "You and your mother are arseholes.", "YTA \n\nSounds like you\u2019re jealous of their intelligence and their ability to have conversations you just don\u2019t understand because they use big words.\n\nJust because can\u2019t join in doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re blabbering.", "The only AH are your hateful mother and you!!! She has things in common with your dad, people pray and hope for that kind of stuff and because you are such a Jack wagon you got your mother involved to insult your gf. Enjoy the break up and probably being alone for who knows how long.", "Oh man\u2026 YTA. If the fact that your girlfriend is smarter than you bothers you so much, start studying. Maybe you and your mom can split the cost of some books. \n\nOtherwise, let the conversation happen. Be happy that your dad and your girlfriend enjoy each other\u2019s company.", "YTA.  It's a harmless conversation between two adults who probably don't have many other people that can relate to them.   Sounds like a you problem to me.", "YTA - You are the AH. You and the dude who got made that his GF could speak Spanish to his family when he couldn't should start a club.", "INFO: What do you, your Mom and other family members blabber on about?", "YTA.  Your wife has common ground with you father?  And you want to shut this down?  Dude, you need a reality check.", "YTA. I doubt she is able to talk about that stuff with you and I\u2019m sure your dad can\u2019t talk about it with your mom. When they are talking why can\u2019t you have a conversation with your mother? Leave your gf and dad alone.", "YTA you\u2019re only upset because you don\u2019t have any idea what they talking about.", "YTA \n\nI can\u2019t understand why you would have such a problem with your gf bonding with your father over a shared interest? Are you not able to make conversation with the others at the table in the meantime? Just sit them near each other so they don\u2019t have to talk too loudly and let them get on with it. \n\nI actually think it\u2019s really sweet that they can get so absorbed in a topic.", "YTA - would it be ok if she were talking to your mom about recipes? Would it be ok for you to talk to her dad about sports?", "YTA. I'm sure there are topics of conversation that don't interest your father or your girlfriend. I'm also sure that they are too polite to tell people to shut their blabbering when these topics arise. Anyone else would be happy that their girlfriend and father had someone to share their interest with. As for obnoxious, someone needs to explain the meaning of this word to your mother.", "YTA, and you sound more than a little insecure my man.", "YTA", "YTA So many people would kill to have their SO and parent get on as well as she and your father do. \n\nWhy don't you engage them in the discussion? Ask questions on what you don't understand?\n\nBased on your mom's response your dad is finally happy to have someone to nerd out with, and I wonder if your girlfriend will see this and realize she doesn't want to continue this relationship with you knowing that her choice of conversation topics will be forever controlled.", "Help, my gf bonds with my father over physics. What a weird thing to be insecure about... YTA", "YTA. I would be so happy if my dad bonded with my girlfriend. You should be as well", "Yta", "YTA - your SO is bonding with your father over a subject that almost no one even grasps, and it sounds honestly so sweet that they've bonded - and you want to take that away from them? Your mom is an AH too; it reads like weird jealousy for both of you to react this way instead of beaming over them being close. That is the kind of shit couples DREAM of happening when they introduce family ffs!", "Soft YTA\u2026 not necessarily in your motives but in your execution. I agree that it is kind of rude for 2 people to dominate the conversation in a larger group on a subject that the rest can\u2019t contribute to. But you handled that when you had the conversation with her in advance and she agreed to tone it down. Bringing it up again when everyone was present for dinner was unnecessary, and things wouldn\u2019t have taken the turn that they did if you had handled that better. I also agree that you should have stood up for your girlfriend when your mom snapped at them.\n\nIf you are socially aware enough to step in and intervene when you\u2019re worried about the rest of your family feeling uncomfortable, then you should be able to do it when someone makes your girlfriend feel that way.", "Yta. I hope she comes across this post sees people are on her side and goes and finds someone without an inferiority complex.", "You and your mom sound jealous and threatened.  Both of you are TA", "YTA. Her bonding with your father over something they are both passionate about is a beautiful thing and they\u2019re not trying to hurt anybody whatsoever. It seems like there\u2019s a criss-cross of jealousy going on here, where you have an issue with her talking to your dad instead of you, and your mum has an issue with your dad talking to your girlfriend instead of her.", "YTA", "Really? \ud83d\ude44sheesh, You and your mom need to stop being so insecure, fr.", "YTA. Hope she dumps you", "YTA. Just say you and your mum are mad you like people who are smarter than you and both need to grow tf up.", "YTA. Does it make you feel stupid?", "YTA and so is your mom. Sounds like your dad and GF have a common interest nobody else in their lives share, so of course they would be stoked to chat with each other! You and your mom landed two brainiacs and want to knock them down for it. Ridiculous dude. Prepare for her to be an ex soon.", "YTA. You sound jealous that your dad approves of your girlfriend's academic career choices. You need to get over that if you want this relationship to work.", "YTA\u2026 you and your mother sound jealous that they have something in common with an interest. Maybe instead of acting like a child try to get some kind of involvement with her hobby and then you all can join in on the conversation.", "YTA I can't believe you have such a low opinion of your girlfriend and her field of study. Or that you don't defend her from your mother's attacks. This doesn't bode well for you. Now that you have showed her who you are, she will probably find someone who can follow a conversation and be interested in something even if they know little about it.", "YTA, it\u2019s very rare and special that your partner can bond with your dad about a shared career field like that. Typically it\u2019s much easier/common for a gf to bond with a mother due to shared experiences, interests etc. You should being taking the opportunity to bond with your mom when it happens, if she feels left out. It\u2019s *your* job to accommodate her, not your gf\u2019s.  I think it\u2019s too silly for your dad to \u201ctalk to OP\u2019s gf about physics less\u201d as the solution. Seriously, how often does your dad encounter someone to have passionate discussions about physics with? You should love to see the people you love light up. It\u2019s sad you find it annoying.", "Who thinks the GF is going to do his sorry ass?  Anyone?  Anyone?  YTA and so is your mother for being so petty and jealous over 2 people enjoying sharing their interests.  Your girlfriend deserves so much better than you.", "YTA and how rude to call it blabber.", "YTA and so is your Mom.", "Just admit you\u2019re insecure. YTA", "Yuck. You and your mom both like putting other people down. If you don't like your girlfriend, break up with her. Stop making her life miserable like this. And YTA, dude.", "On behalf of all the people who have terrible relationships with their in-laws, YTA. \nWhy on earth would you ever want to sour a great budding relationship between your person and your family? You and your mom need to take a chill pill.", "You and your mom have just set your Dad and Riley against the two of you Physics Haters.\n\nYou do realize that there are worse problems than a parent and your SO sharing an interest that let them enjoy each other's company?", "What I just read: \n\nMy girlfriend's world doesn't revolve around her interest in me for 45 minutes. This has to be stopped, right?", "YTA huge huge AH", "YTA and so is your mother. They were excited to talk about this subject that they have in common because it\u2019s rare to find people in the same field. You and your mom could have had your own conversation or asked them questions about what they were talking about if you felt left out and didn\u2019t have to be dicks about it.", "YTA and so is your mom. Is it that ya'll feel \"dumb\" because they like and enjoy talking physics or are you the type of people that get annoyed if the conversation isn't about you? You should be happy your Dad and for now girlfriend enjoys talking . Do you tell others that have a hobby or any other topic they really enjoy to be quiet? YTA", "YTA. I'm sure it's a joy to both of them to find someone that has something in common with them, especially with something as complcated as physics.", "YTA like seriously. How insecure and pathetic are you and your mom that God forbid two grown adults cant talk about something they're passionate about? Your dad is stuck but your gf can definitely do better than you and find someone that doesn't get butthurt about people having a conversation", "YTA.  Your mom is the AH. While those two are blabbering about Physics you and your mom could chat or do whatever you want to do. Imagine finding someone who understands what you talk about and can hold their own in a conversation...now imagine someone they love and or respect telling them their chat is blabber or being told they can't chat at all...", "And it\u2019s not true your father likes talking to her about her studies so get over it and tell your mom to get over herself", "Could have been handled better-maybe a request to not discuss during dinner but any other time would have been fine.  A dinner conversation that excludes people is hard to sit by and watch.", "YTA. They love talking to one another about the topic. Perhaps a compromise? Set aside some time they can talk between the two of them without putting the rest of the crowd to sleep. While they are having their private convo, the rest of the gang can talk/do whatever.", "It may be an unpopular opinion but I'm going with NAH. Your dad and your girlfriend are interested in this conversation, but if it's dominating a dinner party it is rude to other guests. It would be so simple to set up another time where they can have in-depth conversations for as long as they like, without impacting others.", "NTA I  get what everybody else is saying about your being jealous. But it's also not cool to take over a small dinner table and not include everyone regularly. I would hope that they keep their voices down so others can talk and that they share the table conversations equally. So I think you could take a couple of steps back and start again. Own your feelings and learn how to present them without blaming, if your are making a request then look for compromise on your side as well. \n\nSomething like, \"I'm sorry I asked you and dad to not discuss physics. When you guys talk like that I feel I can't join in and that the rest of us can't share chats across the table and listen to each other. (Then add the feelings that you personally feel) I feel a bit sad when I think that's what is happening, I would like to apologise for the way I dealt with it and see if there's a way we can all be happy , what do you think about it?.\"\n\nSay that to both your dad and your partner.\nAsk them if there's anyway they can make a little time with each other after a meal, or some other time when the other, for example you and your mum, could be doing something else you enjoy.", "I think ppl are going to downvote this but here we go. I think this depends how long and often these conversations are. It\u2019s great that gf is bonding with dad, but again there\u2019s a time and place for everything. \n\nIt\u2019s one thing if they have a private convo somewhere on the side, but if they are dominating the entire dinner table than it would be somewhat awkward for the rest of the guests.\n\nAs a host, dad needs to work harder on making all their guests comfortable vs going off to chat about physics and leaving all the hosting work to mom.\n\nFor gf, the mother in law relationship can be really tricky as it is\u2026 I personally would have paid more attention and maybe put a stop to things before it gets to the point where she calls her obnoxious. Some moms don\u2019t mind and will appreciate the opportunity for one on one time with her son. Others may be annoyed that she is being ignored. Both reactions are valid. Gf just need to be more socially aware unless she\u2019s not looking for a relationship with the mom. Also having dad on her side may not always help\u2026 a lot of women do not take it kindly when their husbands take another person\u2019s side even if said person is their DIL. Just sounds like a lot of future in laws issues.\n\nAlso I don\u2019t think OP is being an asshole by feeling excluded. His feelings are valid. Although I think traditionally it\u2019s usually MIL and DIL bonding while the men give them some room. Or FIL and SIL doing boy things while mom and daughter go off for girl talk. I guess OP and his mom ran out of things to talk about and dad and gf was still at it about physics? \n\nESH.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

She can continue to talk physics to Dad, mom is going to be more pissed. And then what? She gets to deal with a MIL who dislikes her before they are even married. It\u2019s a no-win situation and adds a lot of unnecessary stress to her life. And all for what? A chance to talk physics at the dinner table with FIL. \n\nDad kind of sucks for putting GF in that situation. He\u2019s been married to mom for how long? And has a 26 year old kid together. No way he doesn\u2019t know taking GF\u2019s side will piss off mom. He spends hours getting lost in physics with her and then takes her side after. Being a new GF and meeting parents are hard enough\u2026 and now she\u2019s got a pissed off MIL on top of it all. \n\nHence why I say for her sake \u2026 it\u2019s not a hill worth dying on."]}
