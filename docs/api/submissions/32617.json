Assuming that even if your family did snoop around your phone, I would think a simple response stating how it might not be a good idea since he is allergic to cats, or something along those lines, should be a decent enough of a response without sounding unreasonable. Also, assuming he was distracted like you responded in the comments, why did he wait to the next day to tell you he didn't actually want you to get the cat because of his allergies?", "NTA, first, Sorry for your loss.\n\nYou literally asked him if he is ok with it, and he said yes.\n\nWhat kind of excuse is that he was afraid someone is looking at your phone? So he cant be honest with you when you are around family? and how is his allergy something that needs to keep hidden from them anyways?\n\nHonestly, I would have probably developed an allergy to him at that moment", "NTA\n\nYou asked him.

Question, how long have you been together? Because if it is for more than a few months and if he was truly allergic to cats, you would absolutely know it. Do you have friends with cats that you have gone to their house with him? Why I ask is because if he was really allergic and depending on hoe severe the allergy is, he would at the very least absolutely need to take extra allergy medication to be in their house. At most, he wouldn't be able to go there at all. If you haven't been together long enough for it to come up, than he should ahve communicated it to you the second you asked. Him saying yes, and then freaking out AFTER you have already brought the cat home to the point of leaving and not responding to you is ridiculously immature. Not to mention, you are grieving the loss of someone who is like a sister to you, and this is how he treats you?? \n\nI feel like he may just not like cats and is using this as an excuse. Or he is super selfish, and he is worried all of your attention will be on the cat and not him. Regardless of the reasoning, you really need to consider if you want to continue a relationship with him. If he is treating you like this now through this incredibly hard time in your life, he is giving you a very clear picture of how he is going to act anytime you are struggling and that he definitely won't be there to support you. I would highly recommend cutting your losses and being thankful it ended sooner than later. And in the future, be very weary of anyone who makes your hardships about them.", "I'm really sorry for your loss. \n\nHow long have you been together? Do you live together?\n\nNTA.

Who makes something like this about him?\n\nYou gave him the opportunity to say no, he didn\u2019t, and now you own a cat. Please don\u2019t get rid of it for his sake!!

He's ghosting you now? Let him keep that up and quit trying to reach him, it gives him a certain satisfaction while he's making this power play.

He's really overreacting here, which seems kind of odd to me", "He said \"I only said that in case one of your family members was looking at your phone.\" This sentence should be making you question everything.

Why didn't he tell her the evening before she brought cat home? Why didn't he txt her he remembered he was allergic and didn't feel comfortable anymore? How is she the asshole for bringing home the cat when he lied?", "We have been together for 6 years but we moved in together a year ago and I have a few friends but he doesn\u2019t talk to them and he isn\u2019t always this, we will get into arguments, but nothing big", "We have dated for 6 years,but we just moved in a year ago", "Good point.", "He is very probably not allergic to cats in any difficult way, since nobody would blame him for mentioning that he is allergic to cats in a text message.\n\nWe can invent a scenario in which he is taught as a child that people will blame you for being allergic to cats, but that probably didn't happen.\n\nKeep the cat, don't let him hurt the cat or leave the cat abandoned.", "Speaking as someone who is allergic to cats, I highly doubt that he was distracted by work so that his allergy \u201cslipped his mind\u201d when you suggested taking in the cat. Anyone with allergies is usually hyper vigilant about their allergen(s) and avoids them. I think he didn\u2019t want to look bad in front of your family. Indeed he told you that when **\u201che said he only said that just in case one of my family members was looking at my phone\u201d** \ud83d\ude44. Then when you don\u2019t go along with him and his narrative he starts to [DARVO](https://www.choosingtherapy.com/darvo/) you and strop off in a tantrum . He\u2019s shown you who he is, where his priorities are and where he expects yours to be: him first, always him.  He probably was able to hide his true colours before but it\u2019s really hard to do in times of crisis, you\u2019re experiencing a really hard time and whose feelings does he prioritise?  Sadly not yours, he\u2019s tried to make it all about him so you focus your attention on him and not on your own life. He\u2019s even conditioned you to come up with excuses for his behaviour eg he\u2019s too distracted by work to remember his allergies (so I\u2019m the bad guy)\n\nReally sorry for your loss, keep the cat to remember and honour your cousin, get rid of the guy", "dodge this bullet while he's still just a boyfriend", "I'm so sorry love but there just isn't a reasonable explanation for this. He wasn't 'distracted' if he had time to worry about your family's reaction to him saying 'no'. Best case scenario, where he's telling the truth about his allergy and his motivations, he's shown he's perfectly willing to lie to you, stress you out in a time of grief and ghost you because he doesn't want to 'look bad' to a hypothetical third party. He obviously didn't mind 'looking bad' to you. There's no other scenario that makes him appear any better. There are several where he looks worse, or a lot worse. Keep the cat. Lose the liar. And I am so very sorry for your loss.", "Don't repaint it like that to make it seem like somehow you did anything wrong.  He said he actively lied in case any of your family was seeing the messages (why would they be mad if he said he was allergic??). He ITA, and he punished you for believing him, and for not being psychic.  It's kind of a blessing you're finding out now - people who act like that tend to get worse over time, never better.  \n\n\nI'm sorry for your loss.", "I don't get his reasoning with the phone.  Surely, finding a new home for the cat would involve telling family members why you can't keep it.  Therefore, he didn't keep your family from finding out anything and only made it into a bigger deal than if he said no right away.  So this path leads to more gossip, not less! \n\nThe only way to avoid that is exactly what you should do. Keep the cat and ditch the guy.", "And you put him on the spot and did not give him the time to think it through. What an AH way to treat your partner.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDon'T kid yourself. YOU Are the AH here. Bringing a pet into a home would need two CLEAR and thought out yeses, and discussions about the live with a pet. A pet has a MASSIVE impact on your life.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd: since your partner is allergic, he will NEED to move out (or have you move out) - being exposed to cats when allergic can (and often does) lead to asthma and worse - so he SIMPLY CAN NOT live with a cat withourt risking his health.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo: If you are lucky, you still can decide between your relationship and the new pet you got for yourself.", "He should have been honest with her despite feeling uncomfortable. She clearly didn't mean to put him on the spot.", "Stop trying to think of excuses for him. He could have just not replied or said he\u2019ll respond later.

OF COURSE that is putting the BF on the spot.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEverything but I will have to think about it. let's talk tomorrow\" does.", "She checked with him and he wasn't honest. What is hard about mentioning an allergy? That is the easiest reason to not have a cat. I understand being distracted. But once he realized his mistake, he should have called her back.
