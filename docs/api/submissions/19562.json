When they first got together, I (17m at the time) was still living at home. She moved in about a month into their relationship, and I didn't have a problem with her at first, until she tried to actually mother me. I'm not talking about giving advice or being a supportive role model, more like giving me a 9:00 curfew (I live in a rural town so that's a joke) and cleaning up after HER dog has an accident. Everytime I'd bring it up to my dad, he'd say \"Just try, for me.\"  Needless to say, I moved out soon after. \n\nFast forward to a week ago. My dad invites me over for dinner, out of nowhere, as we haven't spoken in quite sometime. I hesitantly accept, and spend the following few days trying to prepare myself for what they're going to say. I show up that night, bottle of wine in hand, anxious out of my mind. The night goes on for a few hours, us exchanging small talk, until I can't take it anymore and ask why they invited me. My dad said that they were getting married and wanted me to be his best man. I'm not going to lie, I laughed. Hard. This turned into the fianc\u00e9 crying because she thinks that I don't like her, and I told her she was correct. \n\nIt should also be said that given the option between me or his fianc\u00e9, my dad would choose her in a heartbeat. For example, I went on a two-day camping trip. I had a spot in the garage for my car when I left, she had it when I got back until I moved out. And I really only care about that because hail damage.\n\n\nI've been getting comments about if that was the worst the fianc\u00e9 was while I was living there, so I guess this is info I should add to the post. She comes from a very Christian family, and if her parents found out about the situation, I've heard, she'd be essentially shunned. So I guess the biggest thing is her keeping us a secret. She expects us to just accept her into the family, and I guess her assumptions were somewhat correct, but how can she expect that when she doesn't think we're worth of her family? She KNOWS she's doing something wrong, yet she wants us to play along like no one is being hurt. However, at this point, I guess that one thing could've changed. I didn't ask at dinner.", "created_utc": 1686509005, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1471okw/aita_for_making_my_dads_fianc\u00e9_cry/", "score": 6444, "replies": ["##[AITA for blocking your go-to time killer from June 12-14?](https://redd.it/145o4jz)\n\nWelcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

So your dad started dating a woman *half his age* and favored her over you, HIS SON for years, and now has the astonishing audacity to be pissy that you\u2019re not brimming with excitement that he\u2019s marrying her? \n\nThe thing is, I give your dad\u2019s new marriage a 0.02% chance of lasting more than 2yrs. The emotionally volatile wifey will get tiresome and clearly his tastes range grossly young. \n\nYou\u2019re not the AH and you also do not need to let these two boneheads into your life. Family are the people you choose- the ones who stand by you and lift you up. He\u2019s not family, he\u2019s just a creepy old guy you\u2019re allowed to stop talking to.", "NTA tell Missy-- I mean, mom-- I mean, dad's new reason for being --that if she's interested in being your mother, you're fully prepared to go nuclear. And by nuclear, I mean go full maladjusted 14-year-old. \"You're not my real mom!\" Slam doors. \"I hate you, I wish I'd never been born!\" Roll your eyes. \"I don't want to be seen with you in public.\"", "NTA sorry your Dad is not thinking with the right head. It would be interesting if her family found out by \"mistake\" about them not being married for so many years. And the creepy age gap..sounds like a sugar daddy relationship. Ewww", "NTA i had a very similar step mum. She would set my bed time and had a roster for me with an allotted time for cleaning up her cats kitty litter and sent an angry letter to my real mum saying that she was a better mum to me than my real mum, she was the biggest ah to me.", "Nta you dad is gross", "She\u2019s barely older than OP!", "I'm glad someone finally said it. He HAS, in fact, been married 3 other times. He's like an older Ross from Friends. But I don't know, they've been dating for 6 years. I think the marriage might last, but honestly I don't care. I'm done with him regardless.", "That is essentially what my sister that lives with them does lol. She's got depression though so I'm not sure how much of it is on that.", "I'm not sure how much sugar she's gonna get after she finds out he doesn't have a saving bone in his body, but it's gonna be hilarious once she finds out.", "Sorry to hear that buddy. I hope things are better now for you. No one deserves this.", "\"BeCaUsE FaMiLy\" nah. plenty of people don't respond to politeness, so fuck politeness, and not one child in history has ever ASKED to be a part of the family they were born into. sharing a bloodline with someone doesn't guarantee they're a decent person you'd want to keep around.", "That's so sad \ud83d\ude1e", "Fully agree with this.\n\nInheritance is probably going to the new wife who only has 7 years on OP.", "I was 25 when my oldest was born. This would be like going after someone my daughters age. That\u2019s just creepy.", "Teenagers heap so much abuse on their parents. In cases like this, I love to see it. (I was a teenage asshole.)", "Yes I\u2019m around his age when they met and ewww. My kids are in their mid twenties and nope. \n\nThere\u2019s absolutely nothing someone that age has to offer beyond the obvious in OPs case.", "Thank you for furthering the cause :')", "It is! \"Missy - Uh, MOM.\" At least Missy is cool, though.", "They want to show a happy family to her Christian relatives.", "Oh wow! That\u2019s awful. I\u2019m gonna judge here, but I bet any woman that is 27 willing to date and do the nasty with a 74 year old is a gold digger. I hope his will provides for you and your sibs. With that almost 50 year age gap there is soooo much baggage on both sides of that relationship", "Yeah for me that rule would make someone 19. At 24 I don\u2019t want to be dating anyone below 21, even that\u2019s a stretch. A teenager? Just no.", "NTA\n\nWhy would the Christian family care? She's been living with the guy for years. Isn't that enough for them not to be happy?", "According to what I know, not a clue. But I did look up her dad once because he has a business not too far from where they live. I considered telling her parents for her, but after I moved out, I couldn't care less what they do. The only reason I posted this in the first place was because I've been told by multiple people, including my closest friend, that I'm the AH. I wanted to make sure I wasn't crazy for what I did, because I felt it to be completely rational.", "I was waiting for someone to say this!!! \u201cHi Missy! I mean mom.\u201d", "[removed]", "I think with the way technology has advanced in our lifetimes, 5 years makes a difference depending on when you were born. I\u2019m 5 years older than my husband, and we had very different experiences growing up and going to school. I graduated in 2004, so before iPhones and Facebook, and he had all that stuff in high school even though it was only 5 years different.", "I\u2019ve always said that unless both people in the relationship love the other\u2019s kids as much as their own, and the kids love both partners, they shouldn\u2019t get married or move in. Obv this doesn\u2019t apply when all kids are financially stable and out of the house.", "When I was 20 my roommate started dating a woman whose oldest kid was 18.", "Except Missy wasn't that old lol", "Well she is from a really conservative, religious family so predatory behavior is expected", "Your father was 48 and she was 24??", "This is my take also. NTA", "You, my friend, are correct.", "So how far along in the pregnancy is she?", "I was being a smartass. Sorry you're going through such a rough time, man.", "You're good, I can take it :). Thank you for the kind words, my friend, I appreciate it."]}
