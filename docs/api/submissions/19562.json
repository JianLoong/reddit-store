I have not had a relationship with my dad for \u2026 I don\u2019t remember any more. \n\nShe dropped him like a hot potato the second he showed any wear and tear. He even had a facelift for this cow.

But your dad allowed this woman was was barely older than you move into your home, colonize, and try to assume the role of mother when you were still strangers. \n\nThat makes me suspicious that the ultimate goal was to alienate you and get you to move out.
