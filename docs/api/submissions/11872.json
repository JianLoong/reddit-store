[https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1006xur/aita\\_for\\_not\\_bringing\\_supplies\\_to\\_my\\_friend/](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1006xur/aita_for_not_bringing_supplies_to_my_friend/)\n\nI  did end up going back up the mountain with my friends, but like I said I  didn't bring supplies. We all tried to talk to him to come down, but he  refused. I was pretty disheartened, but he made his choice and so had  I. I told him I wouldn't be back, but if he ever wanted to come down my  door was always open to him.\n\nAbout  a month later I was surprised when there was a knock on my door and I  opened it and it was him. He was so thin and dirty, but seeing him off  the mountain made me happy. I got him cleaned up and now he's staying  with me. I was a bit surprised that he didn't want to go home to his  mom, but he told me I was the only one who made an effort to be there  for him when he was acting unreasonable and that he wanted to stay with  me if that was okay. So yeah, he's living with me now and who knows what  the future holds?", "created_utc": 1678379255, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11mwk6p/aita_for_not_bringing_supplies_to_my_friend/", "score": 27, "replies": ["It's nice he is off the mountain but now you have to worry that you will have to take care of him forever.  You need to set some personal boundaries and make sure you are comfortable with him living with you.", "Sounds really positive.", "Did something happen with his mom/family that could have traumatized him?", "You're a good person."]}
