{"id": 11872, "submission_id": "11mwk6p", "title": "AITA for not bringing supplies to my friend anymore? update", "selftext": " \n\nSo back on new year's, I made a post about not bringing supplies up to my friend who was living on a mountain anymore. [https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1006xur/aita\\_for\\_not\\_bringing\\_supplies\\_to\\_my\\_friend/](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1006xur/aita_for_not_bringing_supplies_to_my_friend/)\n\nI  did end up going back up the mountain with my friends, but like I said I  didn't bring supplies. We all tried to talk to him to come down, but he  refused. I was pretty disheartened, but he made his choice and so had  I. I told him I wouldn't be back, but if he ever wanted to come down my  door was always open to him.\n\nAbout  a month later I was surprised when there was a knock on my door and I  opened it and it was him. He was so thin and dirty, but seeing him off  the mountain made me happy. I got him cleaned up and now he's staying  with me. I was a bit surprised that he didn't want to go home to his  mom, but he told me I was the only one who made an effort to be there  for him when he was acting unreasonable and that he wanted to stay with  me if that was okay. So yeah, he's living with me now and who knows what  the future holds?", "created_utc": 1678379255, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11mwk6p/aita_for_not_bringing_supplies_to_my_friend/", "score": 870, "replies": ["It's nice he is off the mountain but now you have to worry that you will have to take care of him forever.  You need to set some personal boundaries and make sure you are comfortable with him living with you.", "Sounds really positive.", "Did something happen with his mom/family that could have traumatized him?", "You're a good person.", "You know, I get a vibe that something happened to him. He is obviously feeling under appreciated by his family and friends, and I wonder if he has undergone some sort of trauma to trigger his reclusive episode.", "So your friend ran away about a year ago and squatted in an abandoned house and then quickly relied on you to provide him with supplies as he had no other means of survival. And now he's living with you?\n\nI don't foresee this going well at all.", "What the hell did his mom do to him?", "I think there is a bigger problem here and potentially a second issue brewing. I\u2019m glad your friend got down the mountain. But there must be some underlying issue why he did that in the first place.  That needs to be resolved. Second is now he\u2019s under your roof. To what end? How does he survive before? Did he have a job? You going to be his caretaker? Look what happened earlier you\u2019re helping ended up being a commitment. Is that going to happen again now? I\u2019m glad you\u2019re so generous but it\u2019s better to clear things up before things become a pattern or a situation that you regret", "I...what?", "Yeah this isn't good. Make sure you come up with a deadline as to how long you are willing to let him stay with you, and have strong boundaries so he doesn't end up taking advantage of you. He sounds like he has a lot of issues that he's not addressing and the last thing you need is enable this behavior.", "eek it looks like you are going to be your friend's keeper", "Be sure and establish some boundaries so it doesn't get to be burdensome with him living in your home.   Obviously something happened between him and his family, so encourage him to work that out.", "Tell him as a way to continue to support him you are requiring him to get a job and start attending therapy otherwise he can\u2019t live with you. Keep up the boundaries, don\u2019t slide back to enabling!", "OP, you seem to go through periods of time when you simply begin to dislike this best friend of yours. From your description of your life events, it does not seem like he can handle another such episode from you. Please try not to do that again. The guy needs to be somewhere safe and stable for his own mental health and maybe yours, as well.", "I'm sorry, but I don't think you should let him stay for too long. You sound very kind and compassionate but he expected you to feed him and bring him other supplies for months. He may be off the mountain, but that doesn't mean he has changed his attitude or habits. He may still expect you to provide for him by paying for all of his expenses.", "I feel bad for his mum, from your original post she physically couldn\u2019t make the trip to his place on the mountain, so him staying with you as though she purposefully made no effort is a shame.\n\nOf course, it also sounds like he faced some sort of family trauma, so maybe his mum is horrible. Truly could go either way.", "Well, that's a start and it might be a good sign. But be careful. This dude needs to figure out a lot of stuff and he'll need a lot of help for it.\n\nHelp that you probably can't provide by yourself. Be careful that he's not taking advantage or dragging you down, because this is a *wild* situation.", "I don't think he will stay forever and because op let him stay, I think they're already comfortable with him staying. I don't think they should immediately worry about all that as if it's an urgent thing, they will just have to wait and see and if problems arise then they should start setting more boundaries.", "I feel the same way. Hopefully OP can help him find a good therapist.", "Really? To me it sounds like this guy wants to use OP.", "It could go either way, dude has been going through some stuff and now he's trying to reenter society.  If he expects to be taken care of indefinitely that's a problem,  but I think he deserves a chance to get his shit together. I'd be interested in an update in like 3 months to see where they are. Not everyone is a user, but we all need help sometimes.", "Hopefully. But what gets me is when OP was sick and couldn't go the friend got annoyed and snapped at him but when OP says he can't keep doing it he says \"oh I never asked you\" then a month later  (half the time between normal supply runs) he comes and asks OP if he can live with him. \nI don't get why he didn't go back to his mum. OP said in the previous post that she couldn't make it up the mountain, not that she was choosing not to.     To me, this kinda stinks of red flags.", "Maybe, but a lot of mom's are super toxic, mine was. She was always a victim and didn't prepare me for life at all. Not having basic supplies was a reality check. The timing isn't a red flag in my opinion. Only time will tell.  Helping his friend right now could seriously make a huge difference in his life. I think it's worth giving people a chance until they prove you wrong.", "I'm also romanticizing the whole mountain man thing. Something about retreating into nature seems wholesome and idealistic. Both good qualities", "While this sounds like a positive step, I hope you establish some clear boundaries so that you don't get to feeling that you are being undervalued and taken advantage of again. One of those steps really needs to be your friend in therapy. If they can't talk out what made them go up the mountain with you. They HAVE to talk it out with someone.", "This is good. I\u2019ll admit I was a little bit worried about your approach towards the end of the last post. Partly in calling him selfish for staying up there but also for bringing people. I was a little worried it would be more overwhelming for him then helpful. But also he was in the wrong for being annoyed when you couldn\u2019t and weren\u2019t willing to come up. But it sounds like it worked and that\u2019s good. It seems like you had a good grip on the situation, and those are nuances and senses that Reddit cannot know and only guess at.\n\nThat being said I hope the current dynamic will work for you. You sound happy about it and I\u2019m glad. I hope things stay well for the two of you, but don\u2019t be hesitant to set boundaries again if you need to. Tbh it sounds like he\u2019s capable of pulling his head out of his ass if he realizes he needs to. \n\nThat said, whether it was fair of him to cut his mom off, or not, I again don\u2019t know. But I wouldn\u2019t pressure him about it. That\u2019s his own relationship to manage. Who knows how she treated him before he left you know?\n\nGood luck to both of you!", "Wow.  Thanks for the update.  You are a good person! \n\nThat said, you do have to have boundaries.  And look...the last one you set, and communicated, and stuck to, worked.\n\nIt sounds like you might be the only person he trusts.  I hope that you are able to get him some help. I hope that you find support for yourself too, not in the form of reddit lol.", "Please make sure your friend gets therapy for his trauma. I\u2019m glad he\u2019s off the mountain and safe with you!", "you should get informed about the laws of squatters rights in your area. A lot of places have a 30 days limit, meaning  anyone who lives on your property for more than 30 days with permission can claim rights as in the eyes of the law they become your tenants. When this happens you will usually need to carry out an eviction procedure if you want them gone, which is real difficult", "So happy for the update.  I\u2019m glad your friend trusts you.  It sounds like he has some mental health challenges.  Lovingly talk to him, ask him if he is struggling with emotional trauma or mental illness, offer to help him access care.  Don\u2019t force him to reconcile or contact family and friends if he isn\u2019t ready.", "This is literally the story of the first two pokemon games. I feel like I'm going insane that everyone in this thread is taking this at face value. This is the character that the post is referring to, who disappears up a mountain: https://pokemon.fandom.com/wiki/Red. This character is the main character of the first game. The post is written from the perspective of the rival character from the first game: https://pokemon.fandom.com/wiki/Blue. OP even refers to this \"mountain man\" as his rival for fucks sake! Has nobody else made this connection?? This is clearly some kind of Pokemon roleplay fanfiction and I am losing my mind that NOBODY has brought it up.", "I definitely feel like something majorly traumatic happened to your friend. You mentioned in the previous post that you felt like you bullied him back in school and that you may be responsible for his behavior now, but unless your bullying was bordering on criminal then you are not the cause. I wouldn't be surprised if he experienced abuse at home, a religious institution, or from another close family member/friend and was brushed off by his parents (or maybe his parents were the culprits). If he's willing to share I'd ask him about it and if there's any indication of abuse recommend therapy.", "I've tried to gently ask about why he did it. The most I've gotten from him is that the attention got to be too much for him and he didn't like it. He *was* pretty popular around our small town, but I wouldn't say he was famous or anything. Like, the local news interviewed him (and the whole team) a couple of times and he'd be recognized by people.\n\nI don't know why he couldn't have just moved out of town, or if I'm getting the whole truth from him. But I don't want to drive him away by asking too much.", "I got that feeling too, I feel like something must have happened to make a person move out to the mountains by themself\u2026 maybe he was assaulted on some way and his family didn\u2019t believe him or something, but that\u2019s all speculation. I definitely think that OPs friend should get a therapist, and OP should really set certain boundaries, like other commenters said already.", "[removed]", "probably tried to serve hot pockets instead of totino's pizza rolls or something equally as abusive", "Yes. Something happened beside the bullying. And it is connected with his family.", "While I can definitely see this being the reason someone left their small town, your buddy took it to a whole other level. And not seeing his family? There's something there.\n\nIt may be as simple as him wanting to have quit the sport that thrusted him into the limelight and his mother not letting him, it may be an unrelated conflict, it may be some unspoken trauma... But there is definitely more behind his sudden departure from society (and utilities....and food...). \n\nI don't think there's much point in trying to push it out of him. But it might be helpful to just make sure he knows you are available if he ever needs to talk.", "Yeah this. I don\u2019t get the need to worry about the future. See what happens. It sounds like he just needs support.", "Heads up, both OP and his friend are male.", "You don\u2019t know anything about this kid\u2019s situation. I don\u2019t know why you\u2019re acting like abuse is unheard of.", "He's off of the mountain, which is a step in the right direction. Next step I think would be finding a therapist so he can work on his issues with his family and heal from those. Then getting a job and getting back on his feet. And eventually moving out. The guy clearly has something going on in his head, but he made a good choice coming down the mountain and asking OP for help, I think.", "Could be. Could also be a work in progress, can take time", "Seriously. Go to another town where no one knows you, go to a city where you\u2019re no longer the big fish in the small pond, live a quiet life in the suburbs.\n\nBackwoods hermit who needs to rely on the help of one of the people he is trying to get away from is probably the worst plan.\n\nHim living off of OP is not going to go well.", "Heads up, that\u2019s a comment stealing bot\u2026 stole that comment from /u/QueenQueerBen. You should downvote and report and report as spam.", "lol it was a joke?", "I was a massive walking red flag in terms of being a user when my boyfriend and I started dating \ud83d\ude05 i was unemployed, and we moved in together after dating only 4 months, but I was injured and physically hit my breaking point, and couldn't work anymore, it took way too long to finally get my back fixed, (3+ years yay healthcare system~) but I probably never would have gotten my back fixed if my boyfriend hadn't taken that leap and helped me, nobody else did. To me OPs friend sounds like they have something wrong going on, and he definitely needs help, but he's never going to get there on his own, so I think it's good OP is supporting him. Obviously OP needs to make sure the friend is working towards healing, and not enabling bad behavior, but I say good on him for helping his friend.", "Bro needs therapy stat.  I've got a feeling this behavior won't completely go away by just moving", "Will do, cheers for the heads up \ud83e\udd23", "Oh thanks, was very confused why I was mentioned. Appreciate it!\n\nGot more likes on this than my actual comment, odd.", "Not a funny one", "This a lovely comment. We all need help sometimes, some more than others. \n\nIt\u2019s great OP is helping but needs to be aware of the situation he is in and be vigilant.", "I laughed, good thing humor is subjective.", "Yep, it can look good on the outside, even, but be really bad. There\u2019s no telling. OP is a good friend.", "I just don't typically laugh at people trivializing abuse I guess", "You do you"]}
