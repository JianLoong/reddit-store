[https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1006xur/aita\\_for\\_not\\_bringing\\_supplies\\_to\\_my\\_friend/](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1006xur/aita_for_not_bringing_supplies_to_my_friend/)\n\nI  did end up going back up the mountain with my friends, but like I said I  didn't bring supplies. We all tried to talk to him to come down, but he  refused. I was pretty disheartened, but he made his choice and so had  I. I told him I wouldn't be back, but if he ever wanted to come down my  door was always open to him.\n\nAbout  a month later I was surprised when there was a knock on my door and I  opened it and it was him. He was so thin and dirty, but seeing him off  the mountain made me happy. I got him cleaned up and now he's staying  with me. I was a bit surprised that he didn't want to go home to his  mom, but he told me I was the only one who made an effort to be there  for him when he was acting unreasonable and that he wanted to stay with  me if that was okay. So yeah, he's living with me now and who knows what  the future holds?", "created_utc": 1678379255, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11mwk6p/aita_for_not_bringing_supplies_to_my_friend/", "score": 277, "replies": ["It's nice he is off the mountain but now you have to worry that you will have to take care of him forever.  You need to set some personal boundaries and make sure you are comfortable with him living with you.", "Sounds really positive.", "Did something happen with his mom/family that could have traumatized him?", "You're a good person.", "You know, I get a vibe that something happened to him. He is obviously feeling under appreciated by his family and friends, and I wonder if he has undergone some sort of trauma to trigger his reclusive episode.", "So your friend ran away about a year ago and squatted in an abandoned house and then quickly relied on you to provide him with supplies as he had no other means of survival. And now he's living with you?\n\nI don't foresee this going well at all.", "What the hell did his mom do to him?", "I think there is a bigger problem here and potentially a second issue brewing. I\u2019m glad your friend got down the mountain. But there must be some underlying issue why he did that in the first place.  That needs to be resolved. Second is now he\u2019s under your roof. To what end? How does he survive before? Did he have a job? You going to be his caretaker? Look what happened earlier you\u2019re helping ended up being a commitment. Is that going to happen again now? I\u2019m glad you\u2019re so generous but it\u2019s better to clear things up before things become a pattern or a situation that you regret", "I...what?", "Yeah this isn't good. Make sure you come up with a deadline as to how long you are willing to let him stay with you, and have strong boundaries so he doesn't end up taking advantage of you. He sounds like he has a lot of issues that he's not addressing and the last thing you need is enable this behavior.", "eek it looks like you are going to be your friend's keeper", "Be sure and establish some boundaries so it doesn't get to be burdensome with him living in your home.   Obviously something happened between him and his family, so encourage him to work that out.", "Tell him as a way to continue to support him you are requiring him to get a job and start attending therapy otherwise he can\u2019t live with you. Keep up the boundaries, don\u2019t slide back to enabling!", "OP, you seem to go through periods of time when you simply begin to dislike this best friend of yours. From your description of your life events, it does not seem like he can handle another such episode from you. Please try not to do that again. The guy needs to be somewhere safe and stable for his own mental health and maybe yours, as well.", "I'm sorry, but I don't think you should let him stay for too long. You sound very kind and compassionate but he expected you to feed him and bring him other supplies for months. He may be off the mountain, but that doesn't mean he has changed his attitude or habits. He may still expect you to provide for him by paying for all of his expenses.", "I feel bad for his mum, from your original post she physically couldn\u2019t make the trip to his place on the mountain, so him staying with you as though she purposefully made no effort is a shame.\n\nOf course, it also sounds like he faced some sort of family trauma, so maybe his mum is horrible. Truly could go either way.", "Well, that's a start and it might be a good sign. But be careful. This dude needs to figure out a lot of stuff and he'll need a lot of help for it.\n\nHelp that you probably can't provide by yourself. Be careful that he's not taking advantage or dragging you down, because this is a *wild* situation.", "I don't think he will stay forever and because op let him stay, I think they're already comfortable with him staying. I don't think they should immediately worry about all that as if it's an urgent thing, they will just have to wait and see and if problems arise then they should start setting more boundaries.", "I feel the same way. Hopefully OP can help him find a good therapist.", "Really? To me it sounds like this guy wants to use OP.", "It could go either way, dude has been going through some stuff and now he's trying to reenter society.  If he expects to be taken care of indefinitely that's a problem,  but I think he deserves a chance to get his shit together. I'd be interested in an update in like 3 months to see where they are. Not everyone is a user, but we all need help sometimes.", "Hopefully. But what gets me is when OP was sick and couldn't go the friend got annoyed and snapped at him but when OP says he can't keep doing it he says \"oh I never asked you\" then a month later  (half the time between normal supply runs) he comes and asks OP if he can live with him. \nI don't get why he didn't go back to his mum. OP said in the previous post that she couldn't make it up the mountain, not that she was choosing not to.     To me, this kinda stinks of red flags.", "Maybe, but a lot of mom's are super toxic, mine was. She was always a victim and didn't prepare me for life at all. Not having basic supplies was a reality check. The timing isn't a red flag in my opinion. Only time will tell.  Helping his friend right now could seriously make a huge difference in his life. I think it's worth giving people a chance until they prove you wrong.", "I'm also romanticizing the whole mountain man thing. Something about retreating into nature seems wholesome and idealistic. Both good qualities"]}
