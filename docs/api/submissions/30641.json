At the start of the lease back in august it was little bits of food here and there, but now it\u2019s lots of food and it\u2019s happening a lot. She constantly drinks my almond milk and routinely leaves the carton empty in the fridge. She has a history of depression and despite having wealthy parents and multiple of their credit cards, I think she\u2019s too depressed to go grocery shopping so instead she\u2019s buying food for lunch when she\u2019s on campus for classes and eating mine and my other roommates food to supplement. I\u2019m extremely frustrated. \n\nI have confronted her about this three times now, and last week I caught her in the act and immediately called her out on it. She broke down crying and said it would never happen again. I tried to level with her and told her to get instacart, and even offered to give her a ride to the store (despite her also having her own car) The next day she ate one of my yogurt cups and a $5 cupcake from an expensive bakery in my city that my sister got me for my birthday. \n\nJen has a soy allergy. She let us know about it when we moved in together, and said she had no problem with us having soy products in the apartment as long as we properly seal the containers after using them. We\u2019ve had soy sauce in the fridge all semester and leftover edamame a few times, no big deal. When I went to the grocery store on Tuesday I decided to buy soy milk instead of the usual almond I\u2019ve bought all year.

The soymilk I bought is from the same brand as the almond milk I usually buy, because it\u2019s cheap and I like all the products I\u2019ve tried from this brand. Needless to say, the packaging looks similar. \n\nYesterday when I get out of one of my classes, I have 5 missed calls from Jen. Turns out Jen grabbed my milk as usual and did not look at the packaging (which is insane because she literally opened the soymilk for the first time and had to break the seal) and drank some of it. She ends up having a reaction, using an EPI pen and going to the hospital just in case. She\u2019s okay, but she is very mad at me, said this is my fault, and is threatening to call student legal. I told her she\u2019s full of shit and she has no case against me, and it\u2019s her fault for eating food that isn\u2019t hers and being too stupid to read labels despite having an allergy. The tension in my apartment is now at an all time high and I\u2019m extremely stressed. AITA???\n\nEdit: calling student legal tomorrow. Going to try and move out.

NTA", "Where I live regular milk and vegan milks come in both depending on brand", "Only twice in 20 years of being diagnosed is not bad at all. Many allergic people have more reactions than that in a year. \n\nBoth of these times occurred when they were under extreme duress. One of them happened when my father had died less than eight hours prior and no one had slept at all. The other occurred under similar circumstances. \n\nThese people were my carers when I was a child. Doing that day in and day out, accidents happen. Think how many stupid mistakes you\u2019ve made in your life. You sound very unforgiving.\n\nEdit: it\u2019s also worth noting that attitudes towards food allergies have changed drastically in that time. When I started school not a single member of staff would learn to use an epipen. If anything went wrong they\u2019d go and grab my mum to deal with it, no matter how far away she was. I had other family members that didn\u2019t believe I had allergies at all and would try and convince me to try some and see what would happen (even after these reactions). I had classes in school where we did science experiments using my allergens and the only precaution taken was telling me not to touch it. Nothing was wiped down afterwards or anything.  I\u2019d go on school camps and be given meals with dairy in (such as lactose free butter) and be told by teachers to eat it anyway because the chef said it\u2019s fine. They all thought my parents and grandparents were paranoid. They still do.\n\nPeople take it more seriously now than they did then. But they still aren\u2019t always very good about it. A lot of people only really see it as an inconvenience to them, and not the impact they have on us. When I was diagnosed people didn\u2019t really know what allergies were- some still don\u2019t. There were no resources, no websites, no government advice and there was no help available for families at all. You figured it out on your own, and sometimes accidents happened as a result. My childhood allergist considered anaphylaxis an inevitability for children that had been diagnosed as such, and back then it basically was, especially if your allergies were more complex.", "Allergies aren\u2019t poison to anybody except the one with the allergy, so that\u2019s not exactly the best analogy. It\u2019s important to always read the label when you have allergies, even if it\u2019s something you buy regularly, because companies can and often do change ingredients. Soy is one of the most prevalent source of thickeners, which is common in plant based milk. Since it was an unopened carton, she should have checked the label. \n\nAlso, it\u2019s not her fucking food, so she shouldn\u2019t have drank it anyway.", ">Allergies just aren\u2019t something to take risks with\n\nWhich is _exactly_ why if you have an allergy you don\u2019t blindly consume food that is A) not yours, and B) you didn\u2019t examine thoroughly yourself. \n\nThe only person to blame for Jen\u2019s allergic reaction is fucking Jen", ">If you put poison in a milk bottle, sharpie out \"milk\" and write \"poison\" and put it in the fridge, you can't act super surprised when someone drinks it. People don't pay that close attention when things are part of their routine.\n\nSo it's OP's fault that the roommate didn't look at the label of someone else's food that she knew she didn't buy before drinking it? As the person with allergies, it is fully Jan's responsibility to look at the things she is eating if she knows she didn't get it and therefore has no guarantee it's safe for her. If part of her routine includes stealing other ppl's food and that means she doesn't bother looking at what she's eating, then that is the risk she took by making that her habit. \n\nAnd the roommate's allergies is not comparable to poison-it would be dangerous for OP to keep something both illegal and dangerous to *everyone* in the household should something happen to the carton it's contained in, not to mention OP would have no good reaaon to randomly put posion in the fridge. But OP has every right to put something that is totally normal to eat and is properly labeled in the fridge that would only negatively affect one person if they both didn't read the label *and* stole food she had no right to.", ">OP was definitely hoping they would drink it\n\nI don't buy that. I don't see that there is any indication that OP wanted to bait Roomie into drinking an allergen - she just wanted the thievery to stop. That the packaging looks similar may explain how the error was made, but the default expectation has to be that the roomie would actually look at the unopened carton before she opened it.\n\n>on Tuesday I decided to buy soy milk instead of the usual almond I\u2019ve bought all year. Mostly because I wanted a change, but **I\u2019d be lying if I said it wasn\u2019t also because I wanted her to stop drinking my fucking milk.** The soymilk I bought is from the same brand as the almond milk I usually buy, because it\u2019s cheap and I like all the products I\u2019ve tried from this brand.

Same brand does not mean that they look almost identical - no manufacturer wants people to buy the wrong thing by mistake.", "People get drunk, people get high, people take prescription medicine that inebriates them, people zombie walk to the fridge in the middle of the night after waking up thirsty, people go to the fridge while busy thinking about this and that and grab the familiar milk carton on auto pilot.

Don't buy into OPs lame ass lies about how they 'totally never imagined' it was possible someone might drink from a carton that looks like the almond milk they are used to without realizing it was soy.

Its a literal matter of life and death, the roommate literally could have died from this if certain factors aligned unfavorably and she didn't get timely treatment. The simple fact that OP did not tell them there was an allergen in the fridge and left it up to chance is evidence that they were hoping for the result where they carelessly drank it without paying any attention.
