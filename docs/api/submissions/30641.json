At the start of the lease back in august it was little bits of food here and there, but now it\u2019s lots of food and it\u2019s happening a lot. She constantly drinks my almond milk and routinely leaves the carton empty in the fridge. She has a history of depression and despite having wealthy parents and multiple of their credit cards, I think she\u2019s too depressed to go grocery shopping so instead she\u2019s buying food for lunch when she\u2019s on campus for classes and eating mine and my other roommates food to supplement. I\u2019m extremely frustrated. \n\nI have confronted her about this three times now, and last week I caught her in the act and immediately called her out on it. She broke down crying and said it would never happen again. I tried to level with her and told her to get instacart, and even offered to give her a ride to the store (despite her also having her own car) The next day she ate one of my yogurt cups and a $5 cupcake from an expensive bakery in my city that my sister got me for my birthday. \n\nJen has a soy allergy. She let us know about it when we moved in together, and said she had no problem with us having soy products in the apartment as long as we properly seal the containers after using them. We\u2019ve had soy sauce in the fridge all semester and leftover edamame a few times, no big deal. When I went to the grocery store on Tuesday I decided to buy soy milk instead of the usual almond I\u2019ve bought all year. Mostly because I wanted a change, but I\u2019d be lying if I said it wasn\u2019t also because I wanted her to stop drinking my fucking milk. The soymilk I bought is from the same brand as the almond milk I usually buy, because it\u2019s cheap and I like all the products I\u2019ve tried from this brand. Needless to say, the packaging looks similar. \n\nYesterday when I get out of one of my classes, I have 5 missed calls from Jen. Turns out Jen grabbed my milk as usual and did not look at the packaging (which is insane because she literally opened the soymilk for the first time and had to break the seal) and drank some of it. She ends up having a reaction, using an EPI pen and going to the hospital just in case. She\u2019s okay, but she is very mad at me, said this is my fault, and is threatening to call student legal. I told her she\u2019s full of shit and she has no case against me, and it\u2019s her fault for eating food that isn\u2019t hers and being too stupid to read labels despite having an allergy. The tension in my apartment is now at an all time high and I\u2019m extremely stressed. AITA???\n\nEdit: calling student legal tomorrow. Going to try and move out.

He was one of the few comedians my parents thought was family friendly enough for kids to listen to. They had one 8-track of his, I can\u2019t remember the name of it. But we listened to it endlessly and on repeat some days. That was probably.. the later seventies? \n\nGod, I\u2019m old. But I loved his show, too.

OP, get ahead of that and have the university intervene on this entire matter. It's gone past stealing food to unhinged and harmful behavior. She needs to seek counseling, and letting the university know she's this unwound with legal implications to other students (and to the university) should prompt them to get her that counseling. \n\nNTA. She's got a serious mental health problem.\n\nSide note: if you mention that part about not wanting her to drink your milk anymore, be sure to make it clear she had promised to stop stealing from you, and you're shocked that she would blindly drink a plant based milk without confirming it wouldn't trigger an allergic reaction.", "I\u2019m gonna call student legal tomorrow and my leasing company because I don\u2019t want to live here anymore.

My 10-year old grandchild stopped me from using my butter in a separated container because I absently picked up a knife she had used to butter a wheat waffle. Not even her allergy, she understands cross contamination is serious for me. This chick is entitled, lazy and needs to be main character.

She is.", "She's lucky soy allergy is usually mild. She probably had the anaphylaxis this time because it was concentrated soy milk instead of trace from soy as a minor ingredient.

How was she supposed to know the roommate is too stupid to know how to read?", "The way she went about it? You mean by buying and putting the milk in the fridge?

Thank you for providing written walkthroughs for games instead of just videos. I find them so much better.", "Why can\u2019t you just say you like soy in stuff? This girl ate a damn cupcake that wasn\u2019t hers without even knowing what was in it. \n\nIf she won\u2019t learn, don\u2019t leave anything sealed in the fridge.

Soybean is a subsidized crop and it is LITERALLY in everything. \n\nWhite bread at the market uses soybean flour.\n\nBakeries use soybean oil. \n\nFried food is cooked in soybean oil. \n\nMaybe it's labeled \"vegetable oil\" but the primary component is soybean. \n\nOP, you are NTA. \n\nStart eating tofu and edamame on the regular. Miso shit up. Stir-fry rice with soybean sprouts. \n\nBuy the \"high protein, low carb\" bread from the market. \n\nSoybean oil is in like,  98% of all mayonnaise and aoli. I can't eat Kewpie mayo and that shit slaps.", "The verbal agreement they had doesn\u2019t sound like much. \u201cSealing the container after using them\u201d just sounds like making sure their food doesn\u2019t cross-contaminate into HER food. You shouldn\u2019t have to guard your own food from having soy in it. Especially if they put them in unmarked containers. She would have no idea what\u2019s in any of them and it\u2019s on her to take that risk. \n\nOtherwise, OP wouldn\u2019t even be allowed to make themselves a tofu dish without warning the friend, even though the friend was already told none of that food is for her?\n\nPersonally, I wouldn\u2019t have lasted as long as OP did. I would have complained to anyone with any power to do something, or at the very least move everything into my room and lock the door.", "For all I know it had soy in it and she had a reaction but she hid it because she saw it as an accident whereas she clearly sees the soy milk as purposeful so now she\u2019s saying something.

I think she\u2019s unhinged honestly and I don\u2019t feel safe living with her anymore after this whole thing because I\u2019m afraid shes gonna do it again on purpose to try and get me in trouble idk. I threw the soy milk away immediately after this happened", "Again, not saying I agree, just letting you know that advice is not valid advice and a good way to *actually* get in trouble.\n\nThis situation wouldn't have effected me, though. I'm vegan and eat soy with a bunch of stuff so roommate wouldn't be safe with a lot of my food.", "I'd start looking for a new housing situation if I'm honest. Look into subletting your room or even go to the housing office of your apartment complex. If you're close enough to a college they might already have a system to move people around. \n\nGet a mini fridge. Hide your food and lock your bedroom door. \n\nAnd just, get away from her. \n\nThis happens in college. My last roommate I had to hide my utensils, pots and pans in my room because they borrowed and never washed them, then her mother stole from me a few times and I had to bitch and bitch until I got my good can opener back. \n\nAnd I would stop talking to her. Anytime she tries to engage I would ignore her. \n\nYou're not responsible for her absurd laziness. \n\nAnd I get depression is hard, but that's her struggle and you shouldn't feel bad or guilty. You tried. You talked to her. She drank her allergy."]}
