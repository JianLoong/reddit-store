One of my roommates \u201cJen\u201d (21F) has been extremely difficult for me to live with. She was friends with my other roommate \u201cLeah\u201d (21F) and we ended up living together. \n\nAmong other issues, Jen eats mine and Leah\u2019s food constantly.

She constantly drinks my almond milk and routinely leaves the carton empty in the fridge. She has a history of depression and despite having wealthy parents and multiple of their credit cards, I think she\u2019s too depressed to go grocery shopping so instead she\u2019s buying food for lunch when she\u2019s on campus for classes and eating mine and my other roommates food to supplement. I\u2019m extremely frustrated. \n\nI have confronted her about this three times now, and last week I caught her in the act and immediately called her out on it. She broke down crying and said it would never happen again. I tried to level with her and told her to get instacart, and even offered to give her a ride to the store (despite her also having her own car) The next day she ate one of my yogurt cups and a $5 cupcake from an expensive bakery in my city that my sister got me for my birthday. \n\nJen has a soy allergy. She let us know about it when we moved in together, and said she had no problem with us having soy products in the apartment as long as we properly seal the containers after using them. We\u2019ve had soy sauce in the fridge all semester and leftover edamame a few times, no big deal. When I went to the grocery store on Tuesday I decided to buy soy milk instead of the usual almond I\u2019ve bought all year. Mostly because I wanted a change, but I\u2019d be lying if I said it wasn\u2019t also because I wanted her to stop drinking my fucking milk.

She ends up having a reaction, using an EPI pen and going to the hospital just in case. She\u2019s okay, but she is very mad at me, said this is my fault, and is threatening to call student legal. I told her she\u2019s full of shit and she has no case against me, and it\u2019s her fault for eating food that isn\u2019t hers and being too stupid to read labels despite having an allergy.

I\u2019d love to hear her call to student legal. \n\n\u201cMy roommate bought soy milk and I\u2019m allergic to soy! \u2026no, she didn\u2019t offer me any. But it looked like the almond milks she always buys and I\u2026 no, she never told me I could drink that or offer it to me either. Anyway, she has *SOY MILK* in the fridge and it was brand new, so I had to open it and.. um. No, I didn\u2019t read the label. It looks just like the almond she buys and I always drink so I thought\u2026 is that\u2014 are you *laughing* at me? Am I on *speaker?* Is everyone there laughing at me? Hello? Why aren\u2019t you talking to me?\u201d", "NTA.  Tell her if she stopped stealing food, this would never have happened.  The give her a bill for all the food of yours she has eaten and be sure to include transportation to the city to get the replacement cupcake.  Call student legal first and tell them that she has been stealing and you bought milk for yourself only.  She stole it and had an allergic reaction. The milk was clearly marked, it was never offered to her, and she had to break the seal on the package giving her multiple opportunities to see she was eating something she was allergic to.  I would personally mark all my food as \"contains soy\" in big black sharpie marker.  If she asks why, \"I am adding soy for flavor as a salt replacement.\"", "NTA.\n\nJen needs to buy her own food and be responsible for checking anything before she east/drinks it.  \n\nLet her call student legal.  Your aren't liable for Jen consuming something she's allergic to.  It's her obligation to make sure that what she eats doesn't contain soy.  \n\nAlso, Jen has been taking your food without permission, and promised to stop when you confronted her.  You are under no obligation to buy food that meets Jen's allergy requirements.\n\nMaybe consider moving.

First of all, like you said, the food was not hers to start with. Second, the food was plainly labeled. It\u2019s on her for both of those. It\u2019s not like you made a recipe with the soy milk and didn\u2019t tell her - all she had to do was read the label of the food she was stealing.", "NTA. I have an allergy myself, and, in my opinion, the only occasions where you\u2019re even somewhat responsible for the allergy of another person is if you\u2019re serving them, you moved an item containing the allergen to an unmarked container, or if you added the allergen to a labeled item that otherwise would not contain the allergen.", "So she is blaming you for:\n  \n* Stealing your food after promising not to\n* Not reading a label when she knows she has a specific allergy\n  \nOh yeah totally your fault.\n  \nNTA at all and she would get laughed out of any legal environment in which she brought this up.", "NTA. \n\nBTW, tons of people have depression and don't steal their roommates' food.

You bought it in hopes that she would AVOID it. You spoke with her about it *three* times and she gave you verbal confirmation that it would never happen again. You are absolutely in the clear.", "NTA. She needs to stop eating your food and maybe look at a label.", "NTA. She should not have drank your milk that you buy under any circumstances. Even if she liked your milk she should have seen that it was soy not almond because the milk is clearly labeled so people don\u2019t have allergic reactions and can safely drink the milk of their choice. Any one with food allergies should read the labels on packaged food especially if someone buys a different brand that has similar packaging to the brand that someone knows they are not allergic to so that they don\u2019t have unnecessary allergic reactions if someone wants to try a different brand of product.", "NTA. If she has an allergy, it's her job to check labels, menus etc. to ensure that she doesn't eat whatever she's allergic to.", "NTA\n\nShe shouldn't be eating your fucking food.

You didn't cause anything, not even 'semi' caused it.  Your roommate experienced the natural consequences of her own behavior.

Wanting to teach her a lesson is one thing, but allergies aren't something you mess with. They can literally be life or death.

On the other hand I can\u2019t believe she ate your birthday cupcake like that is just unreal to me\u2026 I would be PISSED. How do you do that and not expect it to be noticed??", "NTA - Jen needs to grow up. Could there be any chance she did it on purpose to \"teach everyone a lesson\"? I hope not.", "NTA.

She apparently is too lazy to read a label before her new moochery and boo hoo she got sick.\n\nShe would get laughed at if she called student legal. \n\nPut a bill on her door for all of the food she has eaten  and tell her to call mommy and daddy to take her to the damn store or send her money for an Uber so she can get her own stuff.", "NTA.
