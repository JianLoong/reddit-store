I know it is a little dumb to name your kids after things like that but it is not an super unusual or ugly name, it is pretty and it means a lot to me. My husband and I divorced when our daughter was 3, we don't hate each other but we are not best friends either.\n\nThe issue with the new baby is that he explained to me that after he told his new wife the story behind the name of Elsa, she proposed that their daughter should be named Anna, so they could be sisters like in the movie. For me it is totally unfair that they are stealing my naming process from me like that. What if I have another daughter? It would have been perfect to name her Anna and now I wouldn't be able to do it without it looking like I am stealing from them.  My husband doesn't even like Frozen that much. He always said his favorite Disney animated movie was Bolt. I don't know if the mother likes Frozen but I am totally sure she doesn't like it as much as me.\n\nI demanded to him that they choose another name but he thinks I am acting crazy. I called my divorce lawyer but she doesn't think there is anything we can do about this. My mother just laughed at me. I feel so defeated. My sadness turned into anger and, in an impulse of rage, I called my ex husband. I told him that if they insisted with using that name, I would made everything I could to sabotage the relationship between our daughter and theirs, so they never were real sisters like Elsa and Anna. He got really angry and said horrible things to me.\n\nI immediately regretted saying what I said and it is not true, I would never do that, but this whole situation has been so horrible for me and now he is really angry too. I think that I am ultimately in the rigth about why they shouldn't use that name but I was wrong in saying what I said. I want to insist on them picking another name but without going too far.\n\nAm I the Asshole?", "created_utc": 1671035127, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zlvbir/aita_for_not_wanting_my_ex_husbands_new_daughter/", "score": 539, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
