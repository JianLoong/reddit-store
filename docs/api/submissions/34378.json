My then girlfriends parents were really religious and they didn't want me to have anything to do with their granddaughter. When I was finally allowed to see her my ex had already found someone else. After I finished high school I went to study abroad for a few years and I only saw my daughter 2-3 times a year. \n\nI moved back to my home country three years ago and since then my ex has agreed to let our daughter spend one weekend a month with me. \nFor the past few years I've been giving my daughter money for Christmas but this year she told me she didn't want money. So I asked my ex  for suggestions regarding the present and she told me to just get her clothes that she wants. So two weeks before Christmas I messaged my daughter and asked her what clothes she wanted and she sent me a link to a wishlist and told me to just pick something from it. There weren't that many clothes there so I just ordered everything that was on her list. \n\nThis year my ex invited me to spend Christmas at their house since her husband was going away to visit his family so I did. When it came time to open presents my daughter was very happy that I ordered everything she wanted. She tried on a few things but the rest she said she was going to try on later. I went home that evening but at 10pm I got an angry call from my ex saying that I was stupid and irresponsible for buying our daughter lingerie. I explained to her that it was on the list our daughter sent me. We argued for a bit about this and then she hung up on me. Afterwards I messaged my daughter and I told her that I didn't know I wasn't allowed to order this for her but she told me that mom was just overreacting and that she loved the clothes I ordered for her. \n\nIt's been a while since Christmas but my ex is still angry at me but since then my daughter has been messaging me almost every day and she said she can't wait to spend the upcoming weekend at mine. So AITA here? I honestly don't know what to think. \n\nIn case that's important, our daughter is 15, me and my ex are both 31 and we're from Europe.", "created_utc": 1704454171, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18z4rmk/aita_for_buying_my_daughter_lingerie/", "score": 47, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your daughter already is looking forward to your visit, because I am guessing you are the lenient parent.  Set some boundaries, talk to your ex.  I had a situation like this one and there were a rough couple years.  My daughter had my granddaughter just shy of 16.
