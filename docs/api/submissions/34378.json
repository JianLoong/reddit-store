My then girlfriends parents were really religious and they didn't want me to have anything to do with their granddaughter. When I was finally allowed to see her my ex had already found someone else. After I finished high school I went to study abroad for a few years and I only saw my daughter 2-3 times a year. \n\nI moved back to my home country three years ago and since then my ex has agreed to let our daughter spend one weekend a month with me. \nFor the past few years I've been giving my daughter money for Christmas but this year she told me she didn't want money. So I asked my ex  for suggestions regarding the present and she told me to just get her clothes that she wants. So two weeks before Christmas I messaged my daughter and asked her what clothes she wanted and she sent me a link to a wishlist and told me to just pick something from it. There weren't that many clothes there so I just ordered everything that was on her list. \n\nThis year my ex invited me to spend Christmas at their house since her husband was going away to visit his family so I did. When it came time to open presents my daughter was very happy that I ordered everything she wanted. She tried on a few things but the rest she said she was going to try on later. I went home that evening but at 10pm I got an angry call from my ex saying that I was stupid and irresponsible for buying our daughter lingerie. I explained to her that it was on the list our daughter sent me. We argued for a bit about this and then she hung up on me. Afterwards I messaged my daughter and I told her that I didn't know I wasn't allowed to order this for her but she told me that mom was just overreacting and that she loved the clothes I ordered for her. \n\nIt's been a while since Christmas but my ex is still angry at me but since then my daughter has been messaging me almost every day and she said she can't wait to spend the upcoming weekend at mine. So AITA here? I honestly don't know what to think. \n\nIn case that's important, our daughter is 15, me and my ex are both 31 and we're from Europe.", "created_utc": 1704454171, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18z4rmk/aita_for_buying_my_daughter_lingerie/", "score": 540, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She's pretty liberal and just said \"don't get pregnant\" lol I didn't even have sex then or in the outfit lol it made me feel like an adult and cool lol it made me feel pretty and that was a nice feeling. And also, a lot of clothing that is considered lingerie has a purpose for under dresses, skirts, avoiding panty lines, etc. So I don't think you did anything wrong.

Also, buying up everything on her list is a real \"I know I'm a bad father\" move, and you shouldn't be trying to prove you love your daughter by showering her with presents. Aim for meaningful rather than plentiful. I'm going to say YTA, not for buying her an underwear set, but for being non communicative with the main parent of your child on a matter you should be aware might well cause friction.

While I think the gift is probably fine from reading the comments, I also think it's in the mothers rights to decide if a gift is appropriate or not, but the reaction is rather silly. Pointless shouting at you about it now after the fact.\n\nIn the future, especially as you're both her parents, it might be worth discussing with her what your plan is before you bought the presents.

Your intentions are good, OP. So are the mom\u2019s.  Unsure about the daughter, tho\u2019.  When you can have a rational conversation with the mom, I suggest you do so.  She knows your daughter better than you right now.  Is she hosting an only fan site? Running a bit too fast with boys? It sounds to me like the mom is afraid that the daughter might be in a hurry to repeat history and she knows how hard having a kid that young can be(IS).\n\nThat said, you really can\u2019t just take your daughters word at face value here.  Kids at 15 are notoriously manipulative. It\u2019s kind of their job to be pushing the envelope on growing up and often don\u2019t consider consequence or even motive of behavior.  The fact that she is actively putting you and the mom at odds and playing you against each other is exactly what I mean.  Just be\u2026.

So if there was dildos, anal beads and edible underwear on the list would he have bought that too?\n\nJust because a child puts something on the list doesn't mean he shouldn't pay attention to what he's buying.

Both Europe and the US are massive so you cannot generalize, but I am remarking on a trend that I have noticed based on my anecdotal experience. A 30 yo woman from NYC is probably going to be more stylish than a grandma from some remote mountain town in northern Spain...", "Yes, and the op specified that he isn't American, but European.\n\nSo if Americans don't understand what he meant, it's plain ignorance about their own language.", "Reddit is a global platform, so it's up to the user to make sure words aren't being misunderstood due to regional differences. \n\nIt was specified that OP is European, so no excuses here. Oxford dictionary is a 1s Google search away.", "Well I'm in the States, Michigan, and we call lingerie any women's underwear, bras, slips, nighties.", "It's weird that you want to see it.", ">If it's just underwear, why not say underwear?  Probably just a difference in vocabulary (:\n\nYeah, it's a different word usage thing. The actual definition of lingerie is just women's undergarments. So even someone's tatty old granny panties that they wear specfically for their period counts as lingerie, lol.", "Well in America, lingerie = sexy undergarments meant to be seen. We don\u2019t call basic white cotton briefs lingerie.", "And it's incredibly unhelpful for the peanut gallery to be yelling about how the word doesn't matter, when people are drawing conclusions based on the word choice.\n\nLike-- I'm sorry! I think OP deserves to know that his title is misleading, and implies something distinctly different from what he actually did, don't you?", "Ye i agree, i think where i live lingerie is only the sexual lacy stuff, like garter belts, exposed nipples/genitals, and everything else is considered normal underwear. But i do think OP should have given a link in his post to not confused people cos apparently for most ppl that's what it means", "Most of the weird prudish shit on Reddit I\u2019ve seen comes from Asians, particularly the subcontinent, not Americans", "Look, I don\u2019t wear lingerie myself, but I\u2019ve been told that lingerie gives women and/or girls confidence. It has as much to do with sex as the haircut I got a couple weeks ago, or the new pair of jeans I ordered, or - fuck it - my new boxers. Never in my life have I heard of there being an age restriction on certain types of underwear nor have I heard of a daughter being happy about their mother being an underwear controlling prude. I think a child\u2019s sex drive/life is influenced much more by prudish parents\u2019 meddling than their underwear of choice.", "In other countries lingerie just means women\u2019s underwear, he posted a picture of the set, it\u2019s just underwear, not what you\u2019re thinking.", "It was a completely unnecessary \u201cjoke.\u201d Plus it wasn\u2019t even clever or funny.", "Sarcasm often goes get lost online. No harm done on either side.", "That's cool as long as you don't judge other people for preferring comfort.", "I'm all for doing what's best for oneself. I guess I just grew up in a very judgemental household where other people's (!) pantylines were discussed and judged.", "You mean too sheer. Opaque means not see-through.", "Thongs have direct contact with your butthole. That's just a fact, so you are right IF you have a bidet, it might lessen the issue. Most people don't have a bidet. You cannot 100% remove bacteria unless you wipe yourself with antibacterial product ( not advised). This is indeed very different from a yeast infection. But the structure of a thong can irritate more easily and if you add to this sweat ( we all do down there, warm moisture environment), then yes, it would can create  an imbalance. My point was not to say that wearing a thong will give you thrush 100%. It was to say you are more likely to get it or even other infections than if wearing other types of underwear. Of course this is not a primary factor. As you rightfully said, antibiotics etc are mostly what would cause yeast infections", "[deleted]", "This. I recently had to get a dress for a family event and my everyday sports bras don't fit right under it. So now I \"had\" to go get a new bra and sure, it looks nice and perky but it's so scratchy and hard.", "I bought them off Torrid! They aren't available right now, it looks like; Torrid cycles their inventory, and it's been more than three months so it's not in my order history anymore, but Torrid *always* has cute shit, and it's *always* your size.", "Hey, can I just ask: what does \"teddy\" mean in this context? I've seen it on this thread a few times but obviously it's not something my English class covered lol. Could you explain?", "M&S is amazing. A few year back they had this collab with Rosie Whatshername and I was able to get REAL SILK undies in my size for a price my student wallet could afford.", "You know, smarmy smugness about other people's cultural difference *really* isn't a good look, buddy.", "Do you know all of the different connotations (not just the meaning but the implications) of every English word in every English-speaking region in the world? Is that a reasonable expectation for anyone? Even the most cultured & well-educated Americans may not realize this specific word has different connotations in other regions since the meaning is so similar that it would be used in most of the same contexts. It's great and sufficient that there are people in the thread seeking clarification and correcting assumptions.", "And that's great but a huge chunk of reddit users are American who speak and understand the American dialect of English so if we ask for clarification on something because it's used differently in another country from our own, we shouldn't be mocked for \"not understanding English.\"", "Don\u2019t be ridiculous. Nobody is calling a pair of Hanes granny panties lingerie.", "I\u2019m also in Michigan and the one who commented originally that we don\u2019t say Lingerie for just underwear \ud83d\ude02 are you like up in the UP maybe?", "Basic white cotton briefs from Walmart are not considered lingerie. Victoria secrets is considered lingerie. Cmon now. There\u2019s absolutely a difference.", "He bought it on Amazon, he can post the Amazon listing, how is that weird?", "Well in America, idiot = thinking buying underwear for your kid that they chose and wanted is a problem. \nOh and In Canada, lingerie = underwear, tights, socks, slip dresses, bodysuits, bras, bustiers, corsets, robes. Half of those are things we see daily. \n\nYou can continue to spew your shit about cotton briefs and how he should\u2019ve gotten those instead but OP is not an asshole nor is it weird. Go on la senza and see how many not sexy to be seen things they have in the lingerie section.", "Look at Hanro. They make a lot of high-end cotton underwear. And if a white cotton granny panties is $30 bucks a pop, I\u2019m calling it \u201clingerie.\u201d", "Yup, I agree... Of course we draw conclusions based on the words we know. I feel like the language barrier is the biggest issue in the comments here. I am glad that I wasn't the only confused one here tbh.", "Very rarely am I paying that much attention to anyone else's ass tbh.", "Lol that probably has something do with my reasonings too at least subconsciously. My mom always wore thongs and would comment to me and my sister when she saw panty lines in public so I\u2019m probably more self conscious about having them myself", "Thank you, I shall edit that!!", "I stopped wearing wired bras about 5 years ago. So sick of having flesh wounds from something I put on and am immediately desperate to get back home to take off.", "Torrid is my reason to hate you Americans because you have it and I don't. (Obviously just kidding, right!) It's so expensive to have Torrid stuff sent to Europe!", "Good to know, thanks!! I'll have to check them out. It's hard to find comfy cute panties that actually cover my whole butt lol", "It's usually referencing a lacy lingerie that's kind of like a nightgown, but very short and revealing, and probably not comfortable to actually sleep in. Nowadays it can also mean a lacy bodysuit kind of thing. But basically it's a sexy one-piece garment, rather than a bra and panties. [This is an example, but there are many different types](https://images.app.goo.gl/fQa4zvGcVRiPbc4h6). This is what a lot of people think of when they hear 'lingerie\" which is why they think it's weird for a dad to be buying it for his daughter (which is totally understandable lol).       \n\nEdit: and I would be very surprised if your English covered this topic lol so don't feel bad! I'm sure there are many other words for this type of garment.", "Ok, and we shouldn't be called assholes for \"buying underwear for our children\".", "I'm going to paraphrase your request.\n\n\"I want to see the underwear you bought for your 15 year old daughter\".\n\nI'm quite sure that isn't how you meant it and I understand the intent as there's a huge range of \"lingerie\" but You're asking for picks of the girl's underwear.  It sounds pretty bad.", "Ok pervert", "As long as you're comfortable in your thongs and try (!) not to judge other, all is well. None of us are perfect and our mums grew up in a world that shamed their bodies so much. They didn't mean to harm us.", "It never was as bad as that for me, maybe I just picked bad bras this time. But I'll manage for one day. Now I will have to find a new pair of shoes, that's even worse.", "Torrid and Eshakti are the best friends of girls everywhere, I swear. Tell everyone you know.", "Thank you for helping me out! I guess I'd have called it a babydoll. \n\nI was mostly joking about the lesson thing though - fun fact - I actually teach English and I try to teach everyday vocabulary to my students, too - obviously age-appropriately.", "I mean I didn't call OP an asshole. You're kinda being one, but not for buying your kid underwear. But here's a tip, on a platform used primarily by Americans, maybe make sure the verbiage you're using is understandable to the people you're speaking to or clarify what it is you're talking about to give a comprehensive picture of the situation.", "You have to *really* stretch to make that weird. I used to work at Victoria\u2019s Secret and even had to [gasp] handle the underwear people bought for their daughters. \n\nSurely I am wrong for not looking away as I cashed them out. Lord forgive me for my perversion", "Really? They're the pervert? You're the one who has been sexualising underwear being worn by teenagers.", "Exactly, they have their reasons and we have ours, but that doesn\u2019t mean we need to think everyone else is wrong for thinking another way like they did", "Oh lord. I send all my patience for you and your poor feets.\n\n(Weird old wives tale my nan taught me: always bite new shoes and while you do, think 'I bite you so you don't bite me'. I do this every time I get new shoes. Have done since I was a youngun. Anecdotally, it has worked for me!)", "Ok, ok. You're right, I'm sorry.", "I really don't... Being the sales clerk checking people out and seeing purchases is very different from proactively asking to see it.\n\nLook I gave you the easy out \"oh I didn't think about how it might come across that way\" was all you needed to say and no one would think the worse of you.  Continuing to fight to justify it doesn't help your case."]}
