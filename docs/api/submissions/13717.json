Since moving here I noticed a big problem with free roaming cats, and I'm not talking strays as many of them have collars on. I have on multiple occasions talked to the owners that I have identified either by seeing the cat at their home or by looking the cat up on our neighborhood Facebook page (all the residents post their pets under a specific pinned post so if they ever get loose the owner can be found). I explained that I have two dogs that don't like cats and I'm concerned they will eventually catch and injure or kill the cat, or possibly our animals will get hit by a car if my dog is loose on my property and chases the cat. Typically my dogs are very obedient and stop at the property line, or go just into a neighbors yard and stop, but I don't want to chance it. I have also posted on the neighborhood Facebook page asking for people to be mindful of letting their cats roam freely. Which usually gets a few others commenting about how they are tied of their yard being a litter box for these cats as well, but of course also gets the cat owners commenting as if their pet is doing the neighborhood a service by keeping rodents away.\n\nThese conversations have fallen on deaf ears so I spoke to the HOA as it's also in the by-laws that pets must be confined to the owners property, and they said they can't do anything about it, which is a whole other frustration for a different post.\n\nAs such, I took matters into my own hands, with the blessing from my immediate neighbor next to me who doesn't like her yard getting cat poop in it due to them having a toddler that likes to play in the yard, I contacted animal control who came and set a trap between our homes. In the past two weeks we have caught 5 cats, and the officer provides an update each time one is caught so we know only one was a stray and the othe 4 were pets, which the owners had to pay a fine to have their pet released as well as getting a citation for violating the city ordinance on loose pets. This led to a Facebook post in our neighborhood page where the cat owners are complaining that those of us calling animal control are just AHs cause their cats deserve to be able to go outside. Of course the neighborhood is divided on the topic, so I figured I'll ask it here.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Now I know better, but I would feel bad about keeping a cat confined indoors so I don't own any cats.", "ESH\nIts pretty funny that he doesnt want the cats to roam free ( which is understandable) but you dont have your dogs fenced in either meaning there is a risk they could just wander out themselves", "NTA\n\nBut you should build a fence to keep your dogs safe. You can't have it both ways.\n\nThat being said, how have these cats not been coyote dinner?", "Is it a US thing that cats are normally confined indoors? Where I\u2019m from it\u2019s the norm for cats to be outdoors and wander everywhere.  I\u2019m surprised at all the comments here saying cat owners are AHs if they let them out!", "ESH. You spend all this time bitching about loose cats because... You want to let your dogs loose in your unfenced backyard. In a neighborhood where you're all right next to each other. Calling animal control wasn't an A H move but everything to do with your reasoning makes you completely turd-filled.", "I grew up in a rural home with lots of land, and we always had some pets that wohld roam free, but we had enough distance between neighbors that they didn't become a problem for anyone else. That to me is the big disconnect, these owners moved into a subdivision where we are very close to neighbors. There are some neighbors who have signs asking people not to let their dogs do their business on their lawns, I make a point to reel their leash in to stay on the sidewalk when passing their homes and we get along great because I respect their property. I just feel some of the neighbors who are upset are ignoring that fact, it's just a matter of respecting how your neighbors want their property treated, and being able to Control our pets.", "I agree with this. House cats are the number one threat to our song birds. Also if those cats are not fixed they are adding to a greater problem. The owners need to keep their cats in their house or on a leash. It is even recognized that a house cat who lives indoors all it's life can have a fulfilling life and WILL live alot longer then their indoor/outdoor cousins. If they want their kitty's to enjoy the fresh air but don't want to leash train them they can build a catio (an inclosed patio for their cats).", " \n\nObviously this would be the worst case scenario but blaming the cat for the owner's problems is also not the right thing to do", "I think I agree with this one the most. The reason you\u2019re also the AH is because you do the same thing with your pets. You seem to believe that your pets have more rights than the other pets despite \u201cstaying within your property line\u201d \n\nYou\u2019re doing exactly what they\u2019re doing.", "They stated in a previous comment that they're only outdoors, unfenced and off leash with active supervision to make sure they stay. Otherwise, they are fenced in the back yard.

If the cat owners were supervising their pets and keeping them on their property I wouldn't care that they are outside. It is not the same.", "I don't care if they let their cats run free in THEIR yard, but the problem is that the cats don't stay in THEIR yard, they go all over the neighborhood and poop and climb on cars and everything else. Also, my dogs are not roaming free in my yard, they are only in my front yard when I am out there supervising them and ensuring they stay. They are only allowed outside without supervision in my fenced in back yard. Most of the cat people don't even reside on our street with the exception of one who lives on the opposite end of the street, so there is no way they have any control over their animal or even know where it's at likely if it's in my yard. \n\nIf they wanted outdoor pets that were free to roam they shouldn't have moved into a subdivision with neighbors in close proximity.", "What happens when the dog catches and kills the cat because it was in OPs back garden?

Your dogs should be on leash when they aren\u2019t in your fenced-in yard. It\u2019s not the same thing but if you\u2019re going to complain about people breaking the rules you should follow them yourself. \n\nYour neighbors with the cats are by far the bigger AHs but your calling animal control on them when you\u2019re not following the rules to the letter is pretty hypocritical. \n\nTell the cat owners about this fantastic thing called a \u201ccatio\u201d, put your dogs on leash and call animal control if they keep letting their cats roam free.

You may think you have complete control over your unleashed dog until cats run by. They go chasing after the cats. Somehow to you, this makes it just the cats fault?? \n\nYou are all in the wrong. Dogs should either be leashed or in a fence, AND cats should be indoors only.", "Doesn't matter supervised or not, keep your dog on a leash or fenced in. Do you know how many times one of our distant neighbors took their dog for a walk supervised and it still has tried to attack other people and animals?

You absolutely need to work on reducing your dogs reactivity or they\u2019re going to hurt something, be it a cat, rabbit, other small dog, etc. God forbid a toddler try and pet a neighborhood cat and get in the way of your dogs.", " I understand the frustration but we both know there is no way a cat is going to stay contained in a single yard. It boils down to indoor vs outdoor cats which is obviously a far bigger issue than this. \n\nI can see why you took the actions you did but aside from the fine, it feels like the cats suffered more than the owners and I feel there would be better ways of going about it", "No obviously that would be the worst case scenario but blaming the cat for the owners problem isn't the right thing either", "Oh I agree with you that dogs can be dangerous in this situation, especially those with reactivity like OP said their dogs have. It was poor phrasing on my part. I just wanted to clarify because they made it sound like they were giving their dogs the same treatment the cat owners were i.e. letting them free roam unsupervised", "Perfectly executed blametransfer.  :-D", "Which is - the better way?", "Well I mean I'm not blaming the cat, it's a cat it's behaving like a cat that's let outside. But OP is nta, what else is he to do?\n\nYou can't expect OP to let other peoples cats come in and crap all over his garden or cause a danger to his dogs and the cats themselves.\n\nHe is trying to force his neighbours to address the problem they create before something really bad happens.\n\nI would say though, if you have dogs and you let them outside off a lead you should always have a fence, for their safety and the safety of others.", "All good:-) I was just saying. Because in my experience many owners play down their dogs\u2018 behavior. I mean even a usually obedient dog may one day behave in an unpredictable way.", "The best way would be to keep pressuring the HOA for them to intervene as the problem is with the owner of the cat, not the animal itself as its just following its nature. \n\nSome cat deterrents in OP's yard would certainly go a long way though. if there is lots of space for the cats to go it wouldn't take much of a deterrent for them to move elsewhere", "The HOA already said it was out of their hands, though? Whether or not they're correct in that decision is another issue, but in the time being it doesn't sound like they're interested in helping. By causing the owners to pay fines when their cat inevitably gets trapped puts pressure on their pockets. Constantly paying fines is an annoyance, and depending on the size of it, not feasible in the long term. \n\nIt is a temporary stress for the cat. One that can be avoided entirely should they keep them inside after the first time. If they do not, then the owner is putting them in the way of undue stress when they know traps have been put out.", "A deterrent being I.e an 'inaudible-for-humans-sound' thing or?", "I can't really say without knowing more details such as OP's yard, surrounding area etc. \n\nCitronella and peppermint is amazing at deterring cats but toxic to dogs so if that was used t would have to be in high up places that the cats would climb but it wouldn't get into contact with his dogs.\n\nSame with the sonic deterents if they effected his dogs too much they might not be viable", "So OP, having other ppls pets problem put on them, should also go to extra lenght/expenses/timeconsuming actions, becaus THEY, the catowners, dont respect mutual rules in neighbourhood?\n\nNOPE. its like victimblaming.\n\nAnd if catppl insist *their* indoor cats must go out, *they* better encage t*heir* whole yard, incl.

Some government-funded animal control facilities cost nothing to the person reporting the loose animals, only those who pick up trapped pets who were found loose. Animal control in this case may be costing them nothing but time, rather than a monetary expense. Time is much different than money spent keeping other's people's pets out of your yard, especially when it's not 100% effective."]}
