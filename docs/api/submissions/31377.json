That\u2019s about 20 adults plus 6 toddlers/babies.\n\nMy cousin, her husband, and their toddler are out here visiting because he wants to move out of the UK and he\u2019s trying to convince her to move too because they\u2019d have a better quality of life.\n\nFull disclosure: our husbands are much much closer than we are, although I would definitely say that cousin and I are always at least friendly if not friends.\n\nSo we invited them to join.\n\nNow I have to admit that yes in my city people do take any excuse to get dressed up, especially young, expat, professionals which is basically what our whole group consists of. If we go out my friends and I also get dressed up but if we are just going to each other\u2019s homes it\u2019s a much more casual affair.\n\nThey\u2019re also lovely at chipping in so everyone is ready to help with washing dishes, plating food, taking out the rubbish, moving furniture back before they leave etc\n\nSo everyone else came in jeans / shorts / summery casual outfits. Cousin turned up in what I can only describe as a full sequinned mini dress, her daughter in a tutu and her husband in chinos and a shirt.\n\nThey looked a little out of place but nobody commented on it. When it got chilly I offered her a hoodie/bottoms but she said no.\n\nThis morning cousin sent me a long rambly voice note about how I tried to humiliate her by not saying the dress code and how she had to keep pulling her skirt down. Apparently I did this on purpose to alienate her from my friends so that she couldn\u2019t make any potential connections.\n\nShe\u2019s calling me a manipulative AH but my thinking is\u2026.it was a barbecue\u2026.in a garden\u2026.who wears a mini dress to that?\n\n(Edit: the dress was similar to or may have been this one https://www.zara.com/uk/en/mini-dress-with-sequins-p00387173.html?v1=293663834&v2=2290794 )", "created_utc": 1700509771, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17zx5o6/aita_for_not_telling_a_grown_woman_the_dress_code/", "score": 156, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
