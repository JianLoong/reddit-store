That\u2019s about 20 adults plus 6 toddlers/babies.\n\nMy cousin, her husband, and their toddler are out here visiting because he wants to move out of the UK and he\u2019s trying to convince her to move too because they\u2019d have a better quality of life.\n\nFull disclosure: our husbands are much much closer than we are, although I would definitely say that cousin and I are always at least friendly if not friends.\n\nSo we invited them to join.\n\nNow I have to admit that yes in my city people do take any excuse to get dressed up, especially young, expat, professionals which is basically what our whole group consists of. If we go out my friends and I also get dressed up but if we are just going to each other\u2019s homes it\u2019s a much more casual affair.\n\nThey\u2019re also lovely at chipping in so everyone is ready to help with washing dishes, plating food, taking out the rubbish, moving furniture back before they leave etc\n\nSo everyone else came in jeans / shorts / summery casual outfits. Cousin turned up in what I can only describe as a full sequinned mini dress, her daughter in a tutu and her husband in chinos and a shirt.\n\nThey looked a little out of place but nobody commented on it. When it got chilly I offered her a hoodie/bottoms but she said no.\n\nThis morning cousin sent me a long rambly voice note about how I tried to humiliate her by not saying the dress code and how she had to keep pulling her skirt down. Apparently I did this on purpose to alienate her from my friends so that she couldn\u2019t make any potential connections.\n\nShe\u2019s calling me a manipulative AH but my thinking is\u2026.it was a barbecue\u2026.in a garden\u2026.who wears a mini dress to that?\n\n(Edit: the dress was similar to or may have been this one https://www.zara.com/uk/en/mini-dress-with-sequins-p00387173.html?v1=293663834&v2=2290794 )", "created_utc": 1700509771, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17zx5o6/aita_for_not_telling_a_grown_woman_the_dress_code/", "score": 701, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Also her hubby and kiddo sounded like they looked fine for a BBQ too, so idk why she's trippin.", "NTA.  \"...she had to keep pulling her skirt down...\"\n\nHow about clothes that fit?", "Wait wait - did you accidentally say it\u2019s a GLAMBQE? \ud83d\udc83\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc83\ud83c\udffbThat\u2019s the only thing I can thing of unless wait she thought it was an episode of HOUSEWIVES UK??! \n\nNTA - bbq is casual.. like a hoodie and jeans or in the case of a toddler a TUTU", "Oh yes, I always don my club attire to eat ribs in someones backyard. You dont? /s\n\nNTA she did something silly and is unreasonably mad at you because she looked silly. Not your fault.\n\nITT learning I should own a tutu for every occasion, including funerals. My wardrobe is lacking.", "You do you and let them do them.", "In\nWhat\nWorld", "NTA. How are you to blame for her lack of common sense? Its a barbecue. And there were kids. Who wears a sequin mini dress around kids? And for her to complain about constantly having to pull down her dress as if thats your fault too. Shes a walking red flag. No accountability for her actions", "Since when is there even a dress code for a BBQ?  It\u2019s pretty much common sense.", "NTA-A grown woman and man shouldn\u2019t have to be told how to dress for a casual, backyard barbecue.", "NTA. I have an eccentric sense of style and often get dressed up \u201cjust because\u201d. So I don\u2019t think there is anything wrong with wearing a mini dress to a bbq, but seems like maybe she was having some social anxiety and is choosing to put the blame on you rather than addressing the actual source of these negative thoughts.", "I wish I could get away with wearing a tutu.", "NTA. Who the fuck dresses up for a bbq \ud83d\ude02", "Oh no! Chinos and a shirt...", "Well,I guess she could've called & asked about the uniform of the day.  Unless you chose her wardrobe I think this is her problem, not yours.", "NTA. She was thinking of a different set of people who go to things to be seen and not to actually eat.", "NTA Was this a daytime BBQ? If so, that's not generally a daytime outfit, no matter the occasion, save a wedding or something.", "Nta. We barbecue in the USA and no one wears sequins mini dresses. That I know of anyway.", "Nope. NTA!", "What was her logic tho I desperately want you to ask her why she wore a sequin dress to a small get together (bbq) of all things. \nLike. What did she think????", "BBQ is always casual. No one eats BBQ in a sequined dress. BBQ = Casual. It\u2019s too bad she didn\u2019t know that, but I thought that was universal knowledge. \nNTA", "She thought it was some fancy dinner.", "\ud83d\ude04\n\nNo. Youre not the asshole. And neither is your cousin. \ud83e\udd74\ud83e\udd0c Youre blood. A bond that cant bear truth is best broken. \n\nSo... it does sound like her outfit and his bugged you. So there may be truth to what she was rambling about. However... you basically let her know that you had a dress code in your city. Just its probably not good to do it in public. Your cousin sounds like the type that took it to heart.", "Who cares what someone else wore smh. Petty much", "NTA.  This will be her reason not to move to your area.  Clearly you are out to get her since you didn\u2019t tell her not to wear sequins to a backyard bbq (sarcasm)", "NTA", "NTA. Everyone knows BBQ is casual", "Well...IMO NTA, however, the cultures do differ. I think she is over the top calling you out. Has she never seen a BBQ on TV? Is she not familiar with the food or picnics? How do the UK dress for outdoor events? WTH? To hell with that! If she wasn't sure what to wear, she could have also asked you. Goes 2 ways. When I'm invited today and am unsure of the event, I ask a friend or host. They usually respond favorably with a complete explanation of what is expected. But to call you an AH? She's looking for a reason to stay in the UK. Sheesh!", "NTA", "She didn\u2019t ask. Next time, if she does ask, say \u201cwearing a tutu can never go amiss. I have it on good authority.\u201d", "NTA", "NTA No normal person goes to a casual BBQ in evening wear.", "NTA hahahaha", "I would sooo totally not expect to get sauce on my fancy dress!! Tooootally gonna be 100% spot free! Especially when looking after a toddler! \n\nThat was sarcasm in case anyone couldn't tell. NTA", "NTA. And even if you were she is a much to blame for not asking if there's a dress code. And I do agree that any BBQ we've been to or hosted means outdoors, games, messy food,  kids,  drinking and fun.  I mean really lol, how does she dress to go camping?", "NTA. You said outdoor BBQ.   If they were confused they could have asked.", "NTA its a bbq not a night club", "Kinda weird to assume a dress code, if it's a BBQ or simply going to see friends 99% of the time it's just casual wear to us, just wear what would wear going to the shops, lol", "Out of curiosity which country is this in?", "NTA. I feel that most people on the planet would go to a bbq in casual, summery clothes. I feel she was being ignorant and if she was not cetain, she should have asked.", "NTA. You didn't tell her the dress code because there wasn't one. The clue was there anyway when you invited them to a BBQ!!! Best thing to do is ignore comments from the drama queen.", "I'm still stuck on better quality of life in the USA than the UK. What??", "NTA is she the main character?", "NTA. I understand she lives elsewhere but this was a daytime, outdoor event. Sequin minidresses are for night time cocktails or clubs. She could have asked or googled what was appropriate, but none of that was on you, and she declined your offer of comfy clothes. She's an AH for trying to make her mistake your fault.", "NTA\nI love how its always someone else's fault. Put aside the fact that I don't know anybody wearing a minidress to a barbeque. Why would she not call and ask if she was thinking like this. Not your fault.", "So did she flash any clam?", "The only way I could see any confusion would be if you worded it differently,  like \"we're having a *dinner party* and you're invited.\"  Assuming you clearly stated it was a *BBQ,* NTA. I've never met someone who doesn't know what a BBQ is.", "NTA. It is entirely possible she confused BBQ with garden party. It would be a simple mistake. I don\u2019t think it would be the worst idea to apologize for not being more clear with what to expect from an American BBQ. Considering her husband is trying to convince her to move here. Nobody thinks it was malicious, but she\u2019s clearly embarrassed. Ask yourself how you would feel if you showed up somewhere with a bunch of people you didn\u2019t know, only to realize you were overdressed? Help her to laugh about it and move past it.", "Only if you knew this was going to happen because you know your cousin. Other than that, she\u2019s an adult who can make adult choices. She even could have asked you how you were planning on dressing if she wasn\u2019t sure.", "Especially on Tuesdays", "And a tiara.", "Et tu, tu tu?", "The kid was totally fine.", "This. OP is NTA.\n\nBut I will add that it's not just common to wear relatively casual clothes to BBQs in wherever the OP's area is, it's also a thing in the UK, I've never been to a BBQ that requires fancy clothing. Plus, who would want to wear fancy clothing at a BBQ anyway? Smoke, outdoors, grease, all terrible things for nice clothes.", "I wore an evening gown to mini golf one birthday, just because I never have enough excuses to wear an evening gown and I really wanted to, lol\n\nNothing wrong with sequins at a bbq if you're willing to own it and have fun.", "I was thinking the same thing.", "No I agree with you, she\u2019s definitely much more into SM than I am so that probably had something to do with it \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Okay it\u2019s dressier on what we post to IG when we are going out on a night out\n\nShe\u2019s been to barbecues at my house before I left the UK, she even came once in her PJs\u2026she\u2019s well aware it\u2019s a chilled out kinda thing", "I had no idea\n\nWhere are you getting that from?\n\nWhen we met them at the mall the day before they were all dressed normally. \n\nAnd we are from the UK, nobody in the UK dresses up for a barbecue! But even if she wanted to it\u2019s not like we were judging her! She\u2019s the one going weirdo about it after the favt", ">YTA you said they aren\u2019t even from this country so how would she know the dress code?\n\n\n\nSo....? \n\nIf they were concerned about dress code, why didn't they ask? It's a BBQ not a wedding. Have a problem? Ask.", "I'm a straight adult male, but this whole conversation makes me want to get a tutu.", "Excuse me, shouldn't that be \"Tutu and *sparkly* wings?", "Yea, tutu!!

I'd have 17 new friends walking out. I also wouldn't blame someone else for my fuck up. Normal people don't wear sequins dresses unless it's a big deal party or because they just want to. I pretty much always want to", "Not just a mini-dress. A sequinned, shiny, sparkly mini-dress!!!", "Maybe *she* is the kind of person who *would* dislike someone for how they dressed... projection and all that. :/", "She's looking for excuses to *not* move away from the uk.

Cousin is a bit precious, me thinks", "I mean, her husband was wearing chinos and they brought their small child, she must have had a hunch it was not a sequined mini dress kind of party. She thought she'd get positive attention for overdressing, and is pissed now that everyone just rolled their eyes.

We have to chase the logicistas away before they start a hostile takeover!", "Is there some reason you won\u2019t say what city you are in? It seems like it\u2019s possibly relevant to the story", "This is why it\u2019s common for people to text each other asking what they\u2019re wearing before an event.
