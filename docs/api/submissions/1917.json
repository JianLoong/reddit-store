He used to have babysitters but ever since he met his new girlfriend he stopped hiring any help because his girlfriend claimed that she wanted the kids to warm up to and get used to her as the only woman in their life (?wtf?).\n\n\nSo he started asking me to watch the boys whenever he had something to do. I'd help if I'm able but I work a demanding job and need to cover full time. He for whatever reason refuses to acknowledge that.\n\n\nDays ago, he was going for lunch with his girlfriend to meet her friends and wanted me to have the boys. I told him I had to work but he begged me to take the day off. I refused and went to work. At 11a.m a coworker of mine entered the office and behind him were my nephews. I was flabbergasted he told me my brother dropped them off so they coulld stay with me. I was in a state of disbelief but also furious. I felt stuck and terrified my boss would see this and I get in trouble. I couldn't even take time off because of how busy I was. Out of frustrration I called the police and explained what happened. They got ahold of my brother and he wss forced to come take them off me as well as get into trouble with the authorties who spent hours talking to him. My bkss eventually found out and I had to leave work early and go home.\n\n\nIn the evening, my brother called and started screaming at me calling me names of all sorts and saying that I not only ruined his meeting with his girlfriend and her friends, but caused him to get in trouble with the police. He called me a vile SOB and said that I could've had the kids with me for a couple of hours or even took them home and took the rest of the day off.\n\n\nWe haven't been speaking but his girlfriend is constantly shaming me for what I'd done saying she treats the kids better than I do and that I should be ashamed for this.", "created_utc": 1668036177, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yqyviv/aita_for_calling_the_police_after_my_brother/", "score": 270, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She wants to be the only woman in their life? Tf? That's insane. It takes a fucking village (a willing village though. Not one that is being forced. As if we're in Russia in the 1600s or some shit). As someone else mentioned, she only wants this so that any money that was once delegated to child care can now be spent on her. She's a piece of fucking work. \n\nStand your ground and know that you are not wrong in this. That could have cost you your job and livelihood.
