I'd help if I'm able but I work a demanding job and need to cover full time. He for whatever reason refuses to acknowledge that.\n\n\nDays ago, he was going for lunch with his girlfriend to meet her friends and wanted me to have the boys. I told him I had to work but he begged me to take the day off. I refused and went to work. At 11a.m a coworker of mine entered the office and behind him were my nephews. I was flabbergasted he told me my brother dropped them off so they coulld stay with me. I was in a state of disbelief but also furious. I felt stuck and terrified my boss would see this and I get in trouble. I couldn't even take time off because of how busy I was. Out of frustrration I called the police and explained what happened. They got ahold of my brother and he wss forced to come take them off me as well as get into trouble with the authorties who spent hours talking to him. My bkss eventually found out and I had to leave work early and go home.\n\n\nIn the evening, my brother called and started screaming at me calling me names of all sorts and saying that I not only ruined his meeting with his girlfriend and her friends, but caused him to get in trouble with the police. He called me a vile SOB and said that I could've had the kids with me for a couple of hours or even took them home and took the rest of the day off.\n\n\nWe haven't been speaking but his girlfriend is constantly shaming me for what I'd done saying she treats the kids better than I do and that I should be ashamed for this.", "created_utc": 1668036177, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yqyviv/aita_for_calling_the_police_after_my_brother/", "score": 6921, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Work is work, I take you at your word that taking sudden time off for a few hours in the middle of the work day was not a viable option.NTA. \n\nYou're right that this probably destroyed the relationship.

He had no way of knowing if you were actually at work or just said you were to have time for yourself. So he risked his kids safety for a hang out. This are his kids, not yours. You have absolutely no responsibility for them. If he wanted you to watch them that badly then he could have offered to pay you the exact same amount that you would have made working. He also risked your job. What would his response have been if you had gotten fired?? I think you need to re evaluate your relationship and get some separation.

Why wasn't OP's brother working?  If it wasn't a weekday and kids weren't due to be in school, it's still horrible thing to do to young kids: drop them with a total stranger to foist them on OP who was working and had said he couldn't care for them.  Something's wrong with brother: he's terribly entitled, he's on drugs, he's being badly negatively influenced by this new girlfriend who supposedly wanted to bond with them but actually seems to want to get rid of them.
