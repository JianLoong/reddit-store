At weekends my 8 year old son likes to get up at about 7:30 to watch cartoons downstairs. My partner will always make sure she follows him downstairs and criticises me if I don\u2019t get up at the same time as I\u2019m missing out on time with him. I get up at about 8:45 normally. \n\nTo me, I enjoyed getting up before my mum when I was a kid and it was nice to have some alone time doing what I wanted. My son has been happy to play by himself when my partner is away until I get up about an hour after him but my partner thinks I should be up every moment that our son is and tries to guilt trip me saying she has been up early dealing with him when I\u2019ve lazed around in bed. So it\u2019s actually twofold, I should be up to be with him and also to relieve her of her \u201cduties\u201d. \n\nTo me, none of this is necessary. It\u2019s not like I\u2019m getting up at midday. \n\nAITA?\n\nEdit: someone asked what the parenting arrangements look like so I commented with \u201cBasically 100% shared. We both work from home for the most part but she goes in to the office twice a week and I go once every couple of weeks. I do most of the cooking, she does most of the laundry. I do most of the shopping and we share after school stuff. I\u2019ll take him to footy practice every week and swimming on a weekend and she will take him out with her friend on a weekend most weeks. Doctor stuff is almost always me as she\u2019s not keen on hospitals etc.\u201d\n\nEdit 2: Thanks everyone. I will talk to her again about it. Seems like we\u2019re all mostly on the same page. Apart from the person who wittered on about kidnapping. Also it\u2019s been nice to see people reminiscing about their time as children being trusted to be by themselves for a while.

Clearly they have a difference of opinion. \"Listen\" to them - and try to understand their perspective. Maybe they have a viewpoint you haven't thought of. And then share your viewpoint.

Let them learn young and help them process their feelings. Mistakes are a natural part of being human, and to project that you have a perfect kid who will learn from YOUR mistakes when you grew up is unrealistic and a great disservice to their development.

Why the parents didn't leave him one on the countertop or in reach so he could get his own cereal when he wanted without waiting on an adult.

He struggles to wake up in the night if the kids need but wakes up right away in the morning. So I always did all the night things like if they had a dream or needed the toilet, was sick or wet the bed. As I fed them as babies it was me awake in the night. Because of that he happily did the morning stuff and let me sleep. For years my kids would wake at 5:30 and although it was early for him he still got up with them when they were younger. At times he\u2019d bring them into our bed and put in a Disney film and snooze as well while they watched it. As they got older they gradually got later at rising but at your kids age would happily play or turn on the cartoons for awhile until husband was to get up half an hour later.\n\n On days he worked I was still up in time so he could get ready for work and I\u2019d feed or get our kids ready for the day and to leave for school or nursery. On days he didn\u2019t work then I had to be up and ready to go to my work. The thing is I need more sleep or I physically struggle, I have been like this since I got sick years ago but if he wanted a lie in I would let him and I\u2019d get up. He just preferred getting up once he was woken and knew I\u2019d struggle the whole day. Regardless of that once the kids were old enough we didn\u2019t jump up at their first sound. The kids have to get used to alone time and learning some independence even in childhood. That or as adults they will struggle and not handle being on their own and may even jump into any relationship as they can\u2019t handle and weren\u2019t taught how to be alone a child.\n\nYou certainly are not a bad parent for not spending every single second with them.

What\u2019s the plan for teaching these things? Is it age related at all? If so, what age? What does son think? Is he lonely but not comfortable talking to you about it?\n\nThere are definitely legit reasons that an 8yo should have an adult to be actively around, but society has also definitely shifted towards a more \u201chelicopter\u201d default. In my experience if what\u2019s happening here is that your partner feels uncomfortable letting him be on his own and resentful that you aren\u2019t helping her then the only fix is to really dig into the reasons and making a conscious decision to plan for independence.

We only had three channels on the farm before we got satellite, so I'd eat my peanut butter toast in front of the colour test pattern glow until the childrens' morning hour came on. It was bliss.

Going down that steep ass hill 20 minutes from home was LIT with all that padding on. I encouraged my kids to stay close to home, as the world has showed that it can't be trusted with my children, and when they went from one friend house to another friend house the group always stopped at home because back in 2000 phones weren't something you handed to a group of 5-10 year olds. They were not allowed off the road we lived on, and it's mostly moot because all the neighborhood kids predominantly lived in our backyard since my ex had 2 homes on the second lot, his second house ensured that our backyard was wlentirely closed off, and with his first one being on the street, and neighbors with kids on either side, they merely had to shout over the fence or go upstairs and look out a window to check on the kids. Kids should DEFINITELY be monitored, but be mindful that they are also supposed to be trained by the parent so they can be trusted to be alone, and they should also have \"I'm bored\" time, so they can then be shown that they can read books, and clean or write a story for the parents or build Legos and play with dolls or do whatever to entertain themselves in a safe manner. Idk, I'm a 45 year old woman, so the world was entirely different back in the day.\n\nDefinitely NTA.

I loved 'my time' on weekends as a kid. Would get a good 2 hours of quality cartoons / comics / play time in before adults imposed their misguided idea of 'fun' on me.", "NTA I used to love getting up early on weekends to watch cartoons. \nMy only suggestion would be to make sure that your 8 year old can grab a bowl of cereal or something in case they get hungry. If you need to leave a bowl, spoon and cereal out on the counter the night before then so be it. It's good to have that little bit of independence at that age and it's great for their confidence being able to do that sort of thing.", "NTA as soon as my second kid can lift the milk jug to pour it for cereal, I\u2019m never getting up early on Saturday again \ud83d\ude02. Our usual habit is to get up, settle them with a bowl of cereal, and head on back to bed with a cup of coffee. The kids are welcome to play, read, possibly watch TV if they ask first (oldest can operate the remote) or come snuggle with us in our bed until we get up at 830-9.", "I was this age in the 80s. If my parents got up when I did on a Saturday morning, it usually meant someone was sick or dead.\n\nSaturdays were the only chance my parents got to sleep in, and me and my brothers were given run of the place with only two rules: no fighting and we couldn't have the TV up too loud.", "Wish ours would do that so I could get laid now and then. Every morning it\u2019s like Van Damme kicking our door open requesting breakfast.", "This sounds like a good lesson in picking your battles for mom. Learning to be a parent doesn\u2019t come naturally to everyone, and learning to let things go was definitely something I had to work on when I started working with kids!", "He doesn't pour his own cereal and pick out his own clothes at 8? No offense, but she sounds insufferable. Does your child have any autonomy? Your partner needs to remember she's not raising a **baby**, she's raising a **future adult**, and he needs to start learning life skills (including how to be alone) from now!", "Stranger abduction is still very rare, only 1%. There's also a very big difference between the number of children reported missing and children who are abducted. The majority (~91%) of missing children cases are classified as endangered runaways.", "Don\u2019t forget the little feet sounds lollll. Yup, they\u2019re awake.", "We had leftover birthday cake offcuts in the fridge a few weeks ago and my kids thought they were so sneaky with stealing bits. Except the trail of cake crumbs was a giveaway \ud83d\ude02", "They shifted in the 80s, 'cause ... you know.", "I\u2019m in the country as well and while my kids are homeschooled they get ample time to explore our property by themselves. They know the boundaries of where they can go and stick to them. It\u2019s good to let kids be kids without an adult standing over them monitoring their every move.", "It must be hard to help a child learn safety. \n\nI would hope that if I walked past your daughter, and when walking away from her (and not doing anything that would be perceived as a threat), casually alerted her that she dropped something, that she would not feel a need to scream just because an adult talked to her.\n\nI don't want children to fear every stranger and see them as a threat, but I also don't want a child to be too trusting and be put at risk. Good luck finding the safe balance.", "As a former 8 year old waking up super early to watch cartoons was my precious me time and there was nothing I loved more than being alone. SpongeBob at 6am just hits differently", "NTA. Your son is enjoying his alone time, you\u2019re enjoying yours. Your partner is adding drama.", "Couldn't she just call down to him vs getting out of bed? My parents would do that to figure out which one of us were up lol just like a 'hey buddy you alright down there' \n\nKids like being independent! NTA", "I agree, kids love this alone time and it helps them to become self sufficient, which builds their self esteem. NYA", "I remember going downstairs with my brother to watch Sonic the Hedgehog before our parents woke up when I was 3 and he was 6/7.", "Wow you made cooked breakfast at age 6??!!! That\u2019s amazing! I\u2019m still burning eggs at 56! Lol. Well 56 going on 57.  You must have developed manual dexterity early.", "Yes and the loud whispers as they pass the bedroom door to be quiet \ud83e\udd23\ud83d\udc96.", "\ud83e\udd23\ud83d\udc96 gotta love it", "True. \nIn a big city it\u2019s probably more parenting-dependent for a kid to be free or to encourage autonomy or not though.", "I'm at my mother's place and I just asked her if I'm remembering correctly doing that when I was a kid, if I enjoyed having the time to myself while they slept in. She said yes except that I had to share the time with my brother (he's 3 1/2 years older). I can picture myself right now in our old family room sitting on the floor in my PJs with a bowls of Rice Krispies watching Saturday morning cartoons, back in the 80s when Saturday morning cartoons were a real event.\n\nIt's not like we're talking about a Lord of the Flies situation here. What kid wouldn't like to have time in the house to themselves? It's (usually) a situation that they've literally never had before. Plus, I'm betting that a child psychologist would say that it's good for the kid in some way. The beginning of self-reliance and all that jazz.\n\nYour NTA and your partner is a bit the helicopter mom (or mum for you weirdos in other parts of the world :)", "NTA - Some of my fondest memories as a kid were watching my early morning Saturday cartoons by myself. I'd get up, make myself cereal, have my breakfast and start coffee for my parents. When my first cartoon was done the coffee would be ready and I'd bring it to them on a commercial break and dash back to watch more cartoons. \n\nThere was a sense of pride in knowing I could do those things myself and let my parents sleep in a little. I know how hard they worked and I know they appreciated the sleep. (Mostly because they asked for it lol)", "It\u2019s Sunday morning cartoons.. lol", "Straight up Saturday mornings, I used to do my own shit until my parents got up about 2 hours after I did from the ages of 5 to 13. At 13, I got up later than they did.", "Sorry about your mum. I'm sure she loved the morning treats <3 \n\nMine was a single mother who often worked nights, so I would almost always be up for the day by the time she was going to bed. She trusted me enough to feed and occupy myself for a few hours before she would get up around 11 or 12. When I was younger she'd make sure that I had lots of snacks that didn't require the oven. It'd probably be frowned upon by a lot of people, but my grandmother lived nearby, and I always loved those quiet mornings where I could just play and watch whatever I wanted on TV! And she definitely appreciated being able to sleep for a few hours between shifts.", "My siblings and I would make Bisquick coffee cake too! Yum memories. I\u2019m sure your mom loved it.", "Instead of framing it as her getting up unnecessarily frame it as what she is doing is an actual negative not just a waste of time. \n\nRather than you missing out on time with your son it's her *depriving* your son of some time alone that he actually want's", "My dad\u2019s mom lived with us from the time I was 9 until I was 13. \n\nIn elementary school, she was tasked with watching me get on the bus since we lived off a busy highway. It got to the point where I would literally avoid getting her up until I had to leave because if she was up any earlier than that, she interfered with everything. My dad even told her to leave me alone and I was capable of getting dressed and getting my own breakfast. \n\nAs long as the kid isn\u2019t breaking things, burning the house down, etc, mom can give him an hour or so in the morning for himself", "He's 8, if he wants your attention, he'll get your attention...", "Tell us more stories, Grandpa.", "Now they are called lawn mower or snow plow parents (I have a few teachers in my family and this is what they call them) because they basically won't let their kids figure out anything or struggle on their own in order to resolve or figure things out. They just mow down or plow right over whoever or whatever stands in their kids way.", "I still use that quote. It\u2019s very handy.", "She was being the Morgan of the family :)", "I had to, cause 1 wasn't enough.", "Lol, NTA, as a kid I looooved getting up super early in the weekends, before anyone else in the house, and go play Sega or PlayStation for ages. When I got older and became a teenager, I switched to being lazy and staying in bed till noon. Let kids be kids and have some freedom.", "NTA. I can\u2019t wait for my kids not f\u2014king come into my room to wake me up and just fill their own bowls with cereal. I love them, but 7:30am is too early.", "I absolutely loved my mornings watching tv before mum got up. \nI\u2019d create some kind of weird den with the sofa cushions, eat cereal and enjoy the alone time", "NTA, my brother and I loved getting up before our parents and older sister. She\u2019s 5 years older than him and 7 older than me. We\u2019d hang out in my brothers room making forts on the lower half of his bunk bed or playing gameboy pod racers until we\u2019d hear people get up, but it was our time to do what we wanted. (And it helped us have a better relationship with each other). My parents went over everything in the house with us when we were younger to make sure we couldn\u2019t get into the bad things or knew how to hold a knife properly (we knew how to slice a grapefruit in half to eat. But my parents understood that us having some independent time was good for us.", "NTA. Two things. The kid is old enough to be up watching tv or eating a snack. The wife\u2019s nagging is a problem. INFO: does she require you to also go to bed when she does? Is she jealous that you\u2019re sleeping in?", "Play pirate ships. Set sail and raise the jolly roger on the flagpole. Arrrr!\n\nBut seriously, learning to feed yourself and learning iniative and self reliance are really important lessons. You're supposed to be raising him to be an adult. He can also learn to help make lunch and dinner, wash the dishes, clean the benches.", "No, she used to but I stopped that over 10 years ago. I am a night owl, she is in bed by 9pm most nights. She\u2019s one of those people who thinks that getting up late is lazy but going to bed early isn\u2019t - regardless of how much sleep someone has. So her 9 to 10 hours of sleep every night isn\u2019t lazy but my 6-7 hours is because I will sleep past 8am.", "I think you were unfairly downvoted here. These were relevant questions in my opinion as it\u2019s good to get a fuller picture.", "He can and he will do those things willingly - it\u2019s just that she\u2019ll step in when she\u2019s home to do it for him. Weirdly I don\u2019t have anywhere near as much hassle getting him ready for school as she does, as he gets on with it when I\u2019m home alone with him. I will speak with her again about it.", "I\u2019ll give that a whirl, thank you.", "Thank gods I'm not alone, I just turned 30 and I'm still a menace while cooking...", "Lol, I guess following instructions came easy to me.", "He probably feels suffocated and him being difficult is probably his way of having control because she is a helicopter parent. You just let him chill and he's fine with that", "It's like that in Australia too. We have a fearful culture lol", "It was like that in the city, at least in the 60s and 70s in Detroit. Or maybe my mother was a bad parent? But it was pretty common."]}
