Let them learn young and help them process their feelings. Mistakes are a natural part of being human, and to project that you have a perfect kid who will learn from YOUR mistakes when you grew up is unrealistic and a great disservice to their development.

He sneaks downstairs without telling us if he can but she always goes down a moment later \u201cto make sure he\u2019s ok\u201d. Then she complains that she\u2019s had to get up early again.", "He puts the tv on, maybe plays on his Switch and plays with the cat. He\u2019s fine and happy so I agree - he can be left alone for an hour or two.", "My *5* year old \u201csneaks\u201d out of his room early on the weekend to watch cartoons that he\u2019s not normally allowed to (stuff that\u2019s annoying, not inappropriate). We get an extra hour to lay around until the younger one wakes up, and he gets some quiet TV time.", "Should\u2019ve said! I\u2019ll edit my post later. Basically 100% shared. We both work from home for the most part but she goes in to the office twice a week and I go once every couple of weeks. I do most of the cooking, she does most of the laundry. I do most of the shopping and we share after school stuff. I\u2019ll take him to footy practice every week and swimming on a weekend and she will take him out with her friend on a weekend most weeks. Doctor stuff is almost always me as she\u2019s not keen on hospitals etc.", "She could easily sleep in during this situation. An 8 year old doesn't need 24 hour supervision, she is choosing to disturb her sleep in so she can helicopter parent.", "She sometimes complains that she never sleeps in. But to me, she\u2019s getting up unnecessarily. She believes the answer to her getting a lie in is me getting up with him. I believe the answer is leaving him alone for a couple of hours. She sees it as lazy on my part but I\u2019ve tried explaining that he\u2019s fine on his own. He loves going downstairs and watching tv, playing with the cat and generally entertaining himself. He can grab stuff from the fridge and get his own drinks, use the toilet on his own etc. I don\u2019t think she was brought up that way and so thinks it\u2019s not looking after him properly.", "Agreed. I have an 8 year old and before my youngest was born (he\u2019s 7 months) he often woke up before me on weekends. He\u2019d get a snack and a drink if he wanted one and would hang out on his switch in his room or bring his blanket down stairs and watch tv. \n\nNow the baby gets me up every day at 6-6.30, so I\u2019m up, but he was absolutely fine before that.", "This! Kids learning how to be self-sufficient is not a bad thing. I have always been an early riser, so my kids rarely had the opportunity to be completely alone by default. My youngest was in kindergarten, when I got a concerned call from his teacher. She said that he was spending an awful amount of time in the bathroom and wondering if there may be an issue she wasn't aware of. (Understandable concern as it was an issue at home as well) But, we both laughed when I explained to her that he had recently discovered that the bathroom is actually the only place he is ever alone. He enjoyed his alone time. Of course we set him up after this to have his alone time so this issue faded away. Kids need this!", "Sounds like he\u2019s looking to have that independent time if he tries to sneak down without you hearing.", "NTA, 8 is old enough. \n\nAt the same time, you and your partner both usually work from home, what's the issue with going to bed/waking up a little earlier? 7:30 is not early by any stretch, I'd call 8:45 a huge sleep-in. Why (if she knows son will get up at 7:30) doesn't your partner go to bed at a time when a 7:30 doesn't feel early?\n\nSeems like this is an easy fix for her if she has an issue.", "Sometimes couples do nice things for each other because they know it's important to their partner.", "I was certainly looking for it, at that age! I coveted my quiet hour or two and have vivid, fond memories of it.", "Yep, what's your point?"]}
