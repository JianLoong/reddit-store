I wonder if it has something to do with her family and how she was raised, but it sounds like a lot of internalized misogyny.\n\nI also would consider discussing it with your brother: **not in a way where he confronts SIL** but maybe to check on his daughter because SIL\u2019s comment would make me worry that her daughter is receiving different treatment.\n\nEdit to add: others have also pointed this out, but please do consider checking with your brother to make sure that the kids are not being inundated with this kind of thinking.", ">that his wife was just showing compassion \n\nWhat, exactly, does he think is compassionate?

Congratulations would have been more appropriate.", "NTA\n\nThe gender bias starts early with some people. Your SIL insisting that you having a gender preference when you continually tell her that you don\u2019t is disgusting.  Your brother\u2019s follow up text parroting really pissed me off.

Honestly, it wouldn't even cross my mind that they might be disappointed to have a daughter over a son.

Cos as much as gender disappointment is a thing (and weird AF) you don't feel that way, you're not in denial, and you have nothing to to feel sad OR bad about. If they feel some kind of way about having a daughter, then they both need to look at themselves rather than trying to force and push their way of thinking on you.", "Your SIL has told your brother a different version of how this interaction went.

She loves her sons more... well, I feel sorry for her daughter, but other than that... more power to her.  It's unfortunate that she's apparently unable to love all her kids equally though.

I also don't usually think it's good to call people weird seriously (although with the right kind of relationship it can be a genuine term of endearment). In this case, though, I think \"weird\" was the kindest term OP could have used, and probably good for SIL to have heard it, even though she clearly isn't listening. That poor daughter of hers, I hope OP is able to have her over a bunch so she can be around people who don't think her less worthy of love because of her gender", "I'm with you, calling SiL weird is a relatively nice response to the misogynistic comment.

I\u2019ve seen people assume that parents would like at least one of each gender like if she thought you\u2019d be sad to not have a boy since you\u2019ve already experienced raising a girl. But to imply that raising her own daughter was someone lesser than raising her sons is odd. I agree with others that you should talk to your brother although it might also do good to check in directly with your niece in an age appropriate way to make sure she\u2019s ok. Be open to her don\u2019t lead her thinking but just be available for her to express any emotions she has over her mother possibly showing favor to her brothers.

My dad's father, a minister and educator, made a long, heatfelt speech about love, marriage, and family.  Then it was my mom's dad's turn- he was an Italian-American post office worker and mom says he was understandably nervous trying to follow up that speech.

I shop like Puritans have sex- in and out in 5 minutes and only for the purposes of procreation.  She enjoys getting jewelry as gifts- I still haven't figured out what makes a good piece and I have to get help every year to figure out something nice for her.  Mom loves us all deeply and she doesn't \\*resent\\* anyone for it, but I respect that she wanted a daughter and never got one.  \n\nIf your SIL had said something like that, I'd have been more forgiving.

Tell your brother that you are extremely concerned for your niece being neglected and mistreated by a woman who doesn't value her as much as her precious boys.\n\nKeep an eye on her. If it becomes clear she's being mistreated, devalued and forced to take on most of the housework while her brothers do nothing, perhaps you can help her. She's going to need it with a nasty mother like that.\n\nAnd I wouldn't allow SIL to ever be alone with your daughters, in case she starts telling them these horrible things.", "Tell your brother that even though she might not like her daughter that you do. NTA", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDon't liasten to your brother, your SIL was the AH.", "NTA no, you're right, she's weird.", "NTA. She was being extremely weird and I feel bad for her daughter.", "NTA\n\nYou aren't sad that you're having a girl.\n\nSIL is one hell of a projector.\n\nI feel sorry for your niece.", "NTA. Please check on your niece.", "> What, exactly, does he think is compassionate?\n\nThis sub needs a lot more OPs calling out nonsense like this.  \"Then they said a bunch of things that didn't make any sense and for some reason I just accepted that and did not check them for lead poisoning\"", "I once knew a friend who married a girl whos condition for marriage was if they had a daughter, they would abort cz girls are just too much. He married her anyway. We are no longer friends (for different but related reasons). This post reminded me of that couple and I'm grateful I no longer know these people.", "Yes, I am feeling concerned for the SIL\u2019s daughter.  There\u2019s a kid who is going to be emotionally neglected, for sure, and OP\u2019s brother better wake up.", "> You know, before I finished reading I was thinking I\u2019d mostly likely comment against your favor\n\nSorry to pick on you specifically but why do people comment like this?  \"If things were different I'd think differently but they're not so I'm not\"?  Isn't that just... life?  Or do people want some kind of credit for actually reading internet posts?", "I think your reply says more about you than anyone else here.", "Everybody thinks the chatter about \"Toxic boy moms\" is exaggerated... until you meet one. They're an uncomfortably weird bunch.", "She didn't tell her husband the truth. She lied and said OP was sad because it's a girl. The manipulation and projection are ridiculous. I'd tell your brother the *actual* conversation and point out he may want to watch how she treats their daughter. She's trying to put this all on OP, who is an innocent victim of her musogyny.", "Fair enough, sorry I didn\u2019t really think of it that way.", "I feel like I have some horrifying googling in my immediate future.\n\nWe're expecting a baby in a few months. It's a boy. He'll be an only child, so, like... I'm going to be the mother of a boy. (We would have been happy with a girl too, but like... You don't get to choose or anything.)\n\nI'm Concerned what people will think...", "meh - dont really care. OP really was kind of an asshole. If she didnt think she was an asshole she wouldnt have posted.", "For real. It's just so icky all around", "I think you will be okay. Just don't make it your entire personality. And Congratulations!!!", "Wow. You are seven layers of something special.", "Neurospicy, I love it! I'm on the spectrum, and I'm an old school AD&D pencil and paper, dice chucking tabletop roleplay gamer. I'm also a major science fiction and fantasy geek. I'm very proud of my weird, and I own that shit.", "Thank you!\n\nInitial Google results are: dear god I would never, but also his father would absolutely put his foot down about anyone teaching his son to behave disrespectfully to women which seems to be part of it?\n\nAnd I mean, that discussion would be hilarious since he'd be trying to wrestle with the inherent conflict in getting insistent with a woman about whether she's allowed to teach his son to disrespect women, but yeah, he wouldn't stand for it.", "I have a relative who was a psychiatrist, and he used to say \"some women love their sons and raise their daughters.\" Unfortunately, it's *disgustingly* common.", "It's a weird disdain mothers have for daughters. A lot of times, it seems to be a mix of religious families where men rule the roost and a lot of women who try to prove they are one of the guys and can't figure out why other women don't like them, so they just hang out with all guys.", "It's always weird when people are less progressive than my late grandfather who was old enough that he saw Halley's Comet twice."]}
