NTA.\n\nSIL\u2019s comments were weird and also really sad. I wonder if it has something to do with her family and how she was raised, but it sounds like a lot of internalized misogyny.\n\nI also would consider discussing it with your brother: **not in a way where he confronts SIL** but maybe to check on his daughter because SIL\u2019s comment would make me worry that her daughter is receiving different treatment.\n\nEdit to add: others have also pointed this out, but please do consider checking with your brother to make sure that the kids are not being inundated with this kind of thinking.", ">that his wife was just showing compassion \n\nWhat, exactly, does he think is compassionate? Trying to tell you to be devastated that you only have girls? Sexism? Openly admitting you don't love all your kids equally because of their sex? There was no compassion. \"Weird\" is a very polite word for her absolutely disgusting behavior and attitude towards gender. NTA.", "NTA-She was neither showing compassion nor trying to be understanding. She was projecting her toxic level boy mom attitude on you.", "NTA.\n\nThe poor daughter. I would probably wonder if the daughter is being mistreated and will keep an eye on her.", "NTA\n\nSIL should NEVER assume another person would feel the way she does. Her poor daughter! You used a far nicer word than many would have used in your place.\n\nYour brother may have been told a different version of the exchange than actually happened.", "Her comment was completely out of pocket and disgusting. What you said was hardly an insult. They need to mind their own business. NTA", "NTA you\u2019re right that IS very weird.", "NTA! Your SIL couldn't be more wrong. You were 100% right. Her attitude and gender bias leaves a lot to think about.\n\n\nI would honestly watch out for the way she and your brother treat their daughter, especially after what she said to you.", "NTA\n\nMessage brother back and say you thought it was weird that SIL said if was fine for me to feel devastated for having a girl and when I explained I was okay with it she then said I was in denial.  Congratulations would have been more appropriate.", "NTA\n\nThe gender bias starts early with some people. Your SIL insisting that you having a gender preference when you continually tell her that you don\u2019t is disgusting.  Your brother\u2019s follow up text parroting really pissed me off. They're in the wrong.", "NTA. SIL has some serious internalized misogyny going on, and I feel very sorry for her daughter. Weird was pretty kind, considering the disgustingly horrible thing she said. I don't really understand the desire to have children (or a lot of things that people do,) but I do know better to say something like that to someone. Honestly, it wouldn't even cross my mind that they might be disappointed to have a daughter over a son. She is gross, and your brother can cram it with walnuts if he is defending her behavior.", "NTA. That was far nicer than the \"what the f is wrong with you? \" that would have come out of my mouth.", "NTA - Your SIL has a strange way of \"showing compassion\" and it seems she found a perfect match in your just as bad brother. Both are AH.", "NTA, she\u2019s lucky that\u2019s all you said.", "NTA she\u2019s insane and your brother is an idiot. It sounds like she\u2019s already starting emotional incest with her sons \ud83e\udd22", "SIL be trippin. NTA.", "NTA and she\u2019s lucky you didn\u2019t call her a risk of emotional abuse for holding bigoted views towards her own child to the point that she actually admits to *loving her daughter less due to her gender*. \n\nShe sounds like a hateful and possibly dangerous person. I\u2019d honestly cut her off as soon as possible, because that\u2019s not a healthy thing for your daughter to be around. And if your brother is defending this behavior, he\u2019s not a safe person for her to be around either.", "Your SIL is projecting her disappointment with having a daughter onto you... People that do this are manipulative \\[trying to make you feel bad when you aren't\\] and delusional \\[trying to read your mind about your baby\\]... NTA and maybe you need to tell brother that he should talk to his wife because she was completely out of line.. I can imagine the story she told him. Calling her weird is mild compared to a manipulative delusional person..", "NTA\n\nI\u2019m curious where your SIL gets her extreme views because I\u2019ve mostly seen that within other (non-US or EU) cultures or religious extremism, but extreme misogyny can be quite common within some of those groups.\n\nIt\u2019s also quite weird that your own brother also just assumes you must be devastated - where does that come from? Hopefully that part is more that he got a very twisted version of the story (if I\u2019m being very generous).", "NTA. Gonna go out on a limb & say your SIL is raising men future reddit posts will be made about.   \n\n\n\"AITA, my husband is mad I don't want his mom to come on our honeymoon. He said she'd help us by planning everything & laying our clothing out each day, but I said it's enough that we're moving in with her after the honeymoon & we should have this one trip to ourselves.\"", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

But your poor niece. Keep an eye on her, maybe let her know you\u2019re a safe person if she ever needs one.", "Ew! NTA. Imagine freely admitting you value your daughter less. And expecting others to do the same.", "In my opinion, you used remarkable restraint. NTA..\n\nMay I suggest though, that you let the other family members know exactly what happened, because it won't be long before the situation gets turned on its head.", "That is some really weird ass projection I'm not gonna lie. NTA in this case. Uhh, anyone know if the daughter is okay or is she being emotionally neglected and put off in favor of the sons?", "Weird folk do not claim this misogynist.\n\nSource: Lifelong weirdo here.\n\nNTA", "NTA. And your comment was extremely real because all I could think before you said that/as you explained what she was saying was \u201cgirl be normal!\u201d Like just very bizarre.", "NTA. I HATE this thinking! I'm expecting my fourth child.  I have three boys.  And many people have told me \"try positive thinking so you'll have a girl\". I'm like what? I always say that I've miscarried a baby before and for me positive thinking means that baby will be healthy and I don't care about the gender.", "NTA\n\nBut I probably wouldn't have been as polite in vocalising how weird her statement was. She wasn't showing compassion. She was showing her ass and was upset that you didn't agree with her whole sentiment of being a 'boy mom' like it's the only thing worth being a parent for .\n\nI feel for your neice, but I also worry that your nephews are going to have some major issues in later life with her.\n\nIf your brother keeps on, I would definitely ask him if he knows why you called her weird. Cos as much as gender disappointment is a thing (and weird AF) you don't feel that way, you're not in denial, and you have nothing to to feel sad OR bad about. If they feel some kind of way about having a daughter, then they both need to look at themselves rather than trying to force and push their way of thinking on you.", "Your SIL has told your brother a different version of how this interaction went. Text your brother,\n\n\"I'm sorry you and your wife feel that no love compares to the love you feel for your sons. As I told your wife, I find that very weird, and ask you both leave me alone so I can enjoy my excitement over my daughter.\" NTA", "I wouldn't call your SiL weird... honestly, I'm not sure what to call her, but her offer and so-called \"compassion\" are misguided at best.  She loves her sons more... well, I feel sorry for her daughter, but other than that... more power to her.  It's unfortunate that she's apparently unable to love all her kids equally though.  Fortunately, most other people (like you!) aren't like that and are able to love all their kids, regardless of gender. NTA", "YTA. She's weird but it was very impolite to say that", "YTA for *how* you said it, but that doesn't make *what* you said any less true. She *is* weird. Acting like someone is in denial because they're fine with not having a son is *incredibly* weird.", "Agree, absolutely NTA. I also don't usually think it's good to call people weird seriously (although with the right kind of relationship it can be a genuine term of endearment). In this case, though, I think \"weird\" was the kindest term OP could have used, and probably good for SIL to have heard it, even though she clearly isn't listening. That poor daughter of hers, I hope OP is able to have her over a bunch so she can be around people who don't think her less worthy of love because of her gender", "I'm with you, calling SiL weird is a relatively nice response to the misogynistic comment. The brother clearly didn't get the full story if he thinks OP is \"upset by the results\"", "The brother is projecting to. Did you not notice him say that just because OP was sad, she didn't have to take it out on SIL. they are bith as bad as eachother and i would be speaking to my parents about the concerns if i were OP because the more eyes looking out for OPs niece right now and in the future the better.", "I\u2019d also be worried that brother and SIL are setting their sons up to see women with that bias.", "But fair.", "Nah.", "Also a really good point!"]}
