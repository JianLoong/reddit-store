I wonder if it has something to do with her family and how she was raised, but it sounds like a lot of internalized misogyny.\n\nI also would consider discussing it with your brother: **not in a way where he confronts SIL** but maybe to check on his daughter because SIL\u2019s comment would make me worry that her daughter is receiving different treatment.\n\nEdit to add: others have also pointed this out, but please do consider checking with your brother to make sure that the kids are not being inundated with this kind of thinking.", ">that his wife was just showing compassion \n\nWhat, exactly, does he think is compassionate? Trying to tell you to be devastated that you only have girls? Sexism? Openly admitting you don't love all your kids equally because of their sex?

You used a far nicer word than many would have used in your place.\n\nYour brother may have been told a different version of the exchange than actually happened.", "Her comment was completely out of pocket and disgusting.

Congratulations would have been more appropriate.", "NTA\n\nThe gender bias starts early with some people. Your SIL insisting that you having a gender preference when you continually tell her that you don\u2019t is disgusting.  Your brother\u2019s follow up text parroting really pissed me off.

Honestly, it wouldn't even cross my mind that they might be disappointed to have a daughter over a son.

Cos as much as gender disappointment is a thing (and weird AF) you don't feel that way, you're not in denial, and you have nothing to to feel sad OR bad about. If they feel some kind of way about having a daughter, then they both need to look at themselves rather than trying to force and push their way of thinking on you.", "Your SIL has told your brother a different version of how this interaction went.

She loves her sons more... well, I feel sorry for her daughter, but other than that... more power to her.  It's unfortunate that she's apparently unable to love all her kids equally though.

I also don't usually think it's good to call people weird seriously (although with the right kind of relationship it can be a genuine term of endearment). In this case, though, I think \"weird\" was the kindest term OP could have used, and probably good for SIL to have heard it, even though she clearly isn't listening. That poor daughter of hers, I hope OP is able to have her over a bunch so she can be around people who don't think her less worthy of love because of her gender", "I'm with you, calling SiL weird is a relatively nice response to the misogynistic comment.

I\u2019ve seen people assume that parents would like at least one of each gender like if she thought you\u2019d be sad to not have a boy since you\u2019ve already experienced raising a girl. But to imply that raising her own daughter was someone lesser than raising her sons is odd. I agree with others that you should talk to your brother although it might also do good to check in directly with your niece in an age appropriate way to make sure she\u2019s ok. Be open to her don\u2019t lead her thinking but just be available for her to express any emotions she has over her mother possibly showing favor to her brothers.
