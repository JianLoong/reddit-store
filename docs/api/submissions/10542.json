Maybe he can give her a lump sum of $1000, $5000 or $10,000. Whatever you are comfortable with. But you should never agree to an indefinite amount of child support for a child that isn\u2019t his. \n\nAshley is the one who chose to procreate with this guy and she needs to deal with it.", "What ifs are wholly irrelevant. We aren\u2019t here to judge possibilities, this is a sub to judge what OP did, not what might happen.", "Where in the post does it say anything about $3,500?", "Nothing OP stated leads me to believe the money will be exorbitant or from a shared amount. There is no way to know how responsible someone will be from a biased outside perspective, especially with a child involved. If the money is blown (there's ALWAYS a risk of this, even with responsible people considering wild inflation) then that's that. I'm not advocating for them to fully support her, but OP shouldn't control his funds. If it's a shared account he would only be able to provide what he earned.\n\nThat's a stretch and was not a concern for OP, just that Ashley wasn't kind", "Many married couples combine funds, so it may be their money, not just his.", "Who said OP is suffering. She said she didn\u2019t want him to do it bc she don\u2019t like the mother.", "Of course, but hubby obviously has a heart and the kid is family.  \u201cI don\u2019t want you to help a child because of old adult drama\u201d is cringe.", "The solution is to take the DNA results to court and make BIL pay child support", "When I left my judgement, there was no mention of her asking for an amount of money. I assumed that she was asking for money for like, food. not 3500.", "No, I'm a woman and I've had an unfortunate personal experience with someone like Ashley.  Gave my former friend money for her kid's antibiotics, she had a high deductible prescription plan and couldn't afford it, and she bought booze for herself because \"antibiotics don't work!\"", "\nWith courts tho it sets up op and get husband to have to keep going.  Many times a non parent ends up on the hook for once supporting the child.  The state doesn't want to do it if someone else has been.", "\u201cWhat ifs\u201d are completely relevant. That is the primary reason for the existence of savings accounts.  just because you\u2019re not a planner doesn\u2019t mean that other people need to be just as irresponsible.", "Op's comment:\n>He was planning to give her 3500 initially but I'm pretty sure it wasn't only going to be a one-off thing and he was going to work out how much support she needed for the long-term. I don't know how she is with her son.", "3500 is a lot of money and that's just to start.  They are married,  it's their money not just his", "Nothing OP states lead a you to believe that the money won\u2019t be exorbitant or from a shared account. She doesn\u2019t give enough details. \n\nIt doesn\u2019t have to be exorbitant in order for it to still impact whatever OP might be planning to do with her husband in the future, regarding having their own child or other financial plans.\n\nAshley has already shown she\u2019s made bad decisions by procreating with a loser and then by this immature behavior regarding her treatment of the OP. It does not bode well for fiscal responsibility.  it is certainly a reasonable question to ask.", "That doesn't mean he doesn't make his own money, just because it went into a shared account doesn't mean he cannot spend his money. It's the same as if he told her she cannot make certain purchases, that's toxic control", "Even with combined funds, many couples have separate spending money of their own. It sounds like the real issue is that OP doesn\u2019t want further entanglement with Ashley, so she would object even if the money came out of her husband\u2019s own discretionary spending amount.", "Read the comments. They can\u2019t support the child indefinitely. \n\nSuffer is a relative term. She\u2019s not going to be in financial distress; but having money go out from her account to something she doesn\u2019t benefit from, is in fact, suffering.", "Yes ofcourse. But that has nothing to do with her husband being able to still help his nephew.", "Yeah, I mean I think that should be on the OP for sure.", "That\u2019s a pretty shitty reason to say dads shouldn\u2019t pay child support. Pick a better friend. The kid can\u2019t pick a better parent and if only 1 parent is paying, the kid will suffer. Your view is very fucked up.", "This is true, at least in the US.", "What ifs are completely irrelevant to my judgement, you can judge differently if you like.", "Even if the man makes 100% of the money, that\u2019s what he\u2019s presenting to his wife as a package.  He makes x amount a year.  That\u2019s what she\u2019s signing up for.  He doesn\u2019t get to suddenly start deducting from that pot for another man\u2019s child. \n\nWhatever he pays to Ashley affects OP, since she\u2019s part of the household. \n\nIf they each have a certain amount of money allotted  for recreation and husband wants to use his share to support the child: then OP would have no cause to complain.  But I highly doubt that is the situation.", "Lol, you are clearly not in a relationship with a combined account. Many married people combine all of their money and then discuss purchases that are beyond regular spending. It is now their money, not his or hers, because they both contribute. OP never indicated either way, so the point is moot anyway.", "It sort of does though, because of the whole argument is that the child is suffering because mom can\u2019t provide enough for him by herself, that is largely alleviated by BIL providing a second source of income. If, after that\u2019s all worked out, the husband wants to give his nephew gifts, great. But Ashley should NOT be reaching out to husband for financial needs instead of BIL or instead of initiating a support case", "She\u2019s not saying dads shouldn\u2019t pay child support. OPs husband is not the dad. Ashley should be going through the court to get child support from the father", ">That\u2019s a pretty shitty reason to say dads shouldn\u2019t pay child support.\n\nWhere the hell did you get that from!?  My argument was why I agreed with OP that her husband *not* give money to Ashley and that she should go to court.  Read the last line in my comment again:\n\n>Ashley might not want to go to court because then the money can only be used for the benefit of her child.\n\nGoing to court and getting child support set up is the only way to ensure that the money is solely used for the benefit of her child.\n\nWhat the hell are you smoking!  Unless you think that OP's husband is Ashley's baby daddy, which OP says isn't the case.  OP's BIL is the baby daddy.", "What are you going on about? You have very poor reading comprehension.", "Yeah I agree with you.\n\nI just dont know how much OP or her husband can actually do about convincing Ashley to take BIL to court or about making BIL be a responsible person. \n\nBut what they can do (at least in the meantime) is help the poor kid a bit with stuff he needs if his mother cant, right?", "That\u2019s an option, the alternative is to say \u201cwe\u2019ll be happy to help after you have a support agreement in place with BIL. If there\u2019s still more you need after that, let us know and we can discuss it then.\u201d It seems like Ashley isn\u2019t going to go the normal route if she can get the financial stability from OP and her husband instead.", ">But what they can do (at least in the meantime) is help the poor kid a bit with stuff he needs if his mother cant, right?\n\nIf he needs things, his mother must go to court to get the money from his father. He will KEEP on needing things. It literally doesn't stop. And until she gets that court order in place, she will keep being unable to afford caring for him. \n\nAs long as it's easier to guilt money out of uninvolved parties than to go to court, this problem will persist indefinitely.", "I mean I wouldn't call buying the poor kid some clothes or books or food financial stability, but I see your point haha. That's certainly something they could try to do first.", "Yeah, it\u2019s hard to know what position Ashley and the nephew are in because OP doesn\u2019t give any details. It could be that he needs food and clothes, but it could also be that they\u2019re making ends meet, just aren\u2019t getting as much as the nephew os entitled to. We\u2019re left speculating because it doesn\u2019t say one way or another.", "You're right. I think the point is that OP's husband definitely shouldn't act like his nephews father! But should still be able to act like his uncle, so forbidding him to give ANY money to the kid is not ok I think, would you agree?"]}
