With this in mind, OP's husband could absolutely confirm that his brother is the child's father through a simple Y-chromosome test.

You and your husband are in no way *responsible* for this kid, but it is entirely understandable that your husband feels bad and wants to help amend the mistakes of his brother. That kid is still his family. Maybe his efforts would be better put towards getting his brother to pay child support, but that's also a legal battle that will obviously take time to play out. Does the mom/nephew have an immediate housing or food crisis playing into this? That probably plays a lot into the morality at play here.\n\nYou don't need to necessarily give in to his calls to support them financially, but you really need to approach this discussion with empathy and try to separate your dislike of the mother from your husband's justifiable desire to provide something for his nephew.", "YTA", "YTA - Your husband is trying to help his nephew.

That comes with a whole emotional baggage in itself and I could understand why supporting someone who made her life hell would be a hill to die on.\n\nSadly, in this case, there is an innocent kid mixed up in old feuds and what should be done is taking BIL to court for child support, not OP's husband paying when he has his own nuclear family to take care of.

I could also be the case that OP i mentally deranged and she made up both the kid and the husband in her head.  \nThere is however no evidence for that, and if Ashley had actually done anything horrible to her, why wouldn't she simply have posted that?", "Yes, it happens a fair amount.", "He could just ask what the boy needs, clothes, shoes etc and supply the product.", "I sound petty?
