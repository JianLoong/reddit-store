Then eventually he started acting cold towards me and was visibly annoyed when i was around him. Some time later i got an intership in paris which was a very big step towards my career and a great opportunity and was very difficult to get in when i showed him the email he started shouting and was angry instead of being finally happy with me he said \u201c what about your studies? Your latest exam went horribly wrong you never succeed in anything you are just a waste of oxygen and money i pay your fees and accept draining my bank account you have never done anything in life and it is a shame that you are my daughter and you do not deserve anything.\u201d That made me loose all the love i had for him.

You don\u2019t have to feel bad about it.", "NTA.\n\nHe doesn't deserve contact. He will drag you down for the rest of your life if you let him.", "NTA. Why would you possibly want to contact your downer dad? Are you feeling a shortage of abuse in France?\n\nIt would be painful for both of you. You'd get a big heap of negativity and he'd need to but refuse to eat his words about you never being successful.\n\nAs has been said, the best revenge is to live your life well.

I hope you can start to heal!", "NTA at all. \"Just the normal amount of hate\" ISN'T A THING. IT'S NOT NORMAL FOR PARENTS TO HATE THEIR KIDS. Your father is abnormal. It sounds like you are doing very well despite him. You never need to contact him again. And if the time comes that you'd like therapy and you have PTSD from him, I'd highly recommend EMDR therapy as very freeing and effective, and doesn't retraumatise you. Well done, you. Be free.", "NTA.  You would be if you allowed him in your life in any way, ever.  He's evil.  There is no \"normal amount of hate\" from a parent to a child; there is only evil.  Move on and get therapy to help process this horrible, horrible abuse you've received from a parent.\n\nI am curious about a mother, though.  Is she in the picture?  Why would she allow you to be put through that?", "Oh my dear, I am so sorry your father was so hateful and undermining to you!  But look at you, an internship and Paris and a job at 19!\n\nKnow that not all intelligent, skilled, or creative people do well at school.  And that doesn't make a person a loser or a waste of space.  Not every wonderful person is a great test-taker.    So what?\n\nAnd not every happy, successful, worthy person with an unreasonable parent grew up meeting that parent's unreasonable demands and perfectionistic standards.  But what I hope you can do is to completely reject everything your dad demanded and everything he said about you.  \n\nHe was wrong.\n\nAs for seeing him again, your father had a new opportunity to give you love and kindness every single day, and every single day he failed.  You have years and years of reasons to have nothing to do with him.\n\nWhy on earth would anyone expect you to put yourself in contact with a person who says such terrible things about you?\n\nYou deserve everything.  You deserve a whole world full of love and kindness and respect.  Don't settle for anything less.  You have survived a childhood that could have destroyed a woman with less strength and determination.  Keep going.  \n\nNTA", "OP, congratulations on your success.\n\nKeep moving forward, if your life is better without your father (and it appears there is every reason why it should be) then stay NC and don't give it a second thought.", "Good for you! Now the asshat can\u2019t hold anything over your head."]}
