Growing up I was always very close to my father but he really didn\u2019t like my husband when we started dating and this caused a bit of a rift. Over time this continued until I unexpectedly got pregnant with Kyle. My father was very angry with the situation, insisting I was making a mistake and refused to have anything to do with me after he was born which hurt a lot.\n\nMy Mom would help me out sometimes with Kyle at their house and my father wouldn\u2019t even acknowledge me or him even when I wasn\u2019t around despite my Mom\u2019s best efforts. After a couple of years my husband and I got married and I tried to fix things and invite my Dad but he refused to come. I ended up crying on my wedding day because I really missed him and walked by myself down the aisle but that\u2019s when I stopped trying with him.\n\nThings changed after the twins were born, they were very early and for a while we weren\u2019t so sure if Jack would make it. That was the kick my Dad needed as my Mom told him if he didn\u2019t patch things up at that point he might never meet his grandson. Since then we have had a much better relationship and he\u2019s a great Grandpa to my kids, he still doesn\u2019t like my husband but they are civil with each other which is enough for me.\n\nHowever, recently my Dad has been talking to me about how much he regrets not walking me down the aisle (I\u2019m his only daughter) or seeing me get married and how he thinks we should redo the wedding \u201cproperly\u201d. The way I see it, I got married properly years ago and don\u2019t feel the need to redo it. I extended an olive branch at the time and he refused it and I kind of feel this is the consequence. However, I can tell it would mean a lot to him and we\u2019ve had a good relationship for years now which I don\u2019t want to risk so AITA?\n\nEdit to add: A few people have asked why my Dad doesn't like my husband, it's partly because of a few things in my husband's past that don't reflect who he is but my Dad couldn't look past, he basically thought he wasn't good enough and thought I could do better.\n\nAlso, some people did the math and asked about ages. We started dating when I was 17 and he was 21 which my Dad didn't like but I didn't get pregnant until I was nearly 19.\n\nFinally, my relationship with my Dad is mostly quite good. He's not a horrible person and he's been a great father and grandfather for 12 years, this is just the one thing he regrets and wants to fix.", "created_utc": 1699410039, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17qbe93/aita_for_not_redoing_my_wedding_for_my_father/", "score": 561, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Personally, (in your shoes) I can't imagine wanting your father to walk you down the aisle after how he treated you. I also find it offensive that he repeats wording to suggest your wedding was 'improper'. I think I would tell dad, \"*My wedding was proper. Although I didn't have the dad I wanted to support me there, my husband and I had each other. That was all that was needed to make it 'proper'. My dad choosing to not attend my wedding broke my heart, but my husband never failed me. There is no decision husband or I I made that has to be redone.*\"\n4. I would also point out to him that his decisions were the ones that left him (1) out of the Father of the Bride role at your wedding AND (2) almost no relationship with you or his grandchildren. He is the one who has to live with his mistakes, but he is lucky that it is only his choice to miss the FOB role that he is stuck with. Despite his past choices, he still gets to enjoy being your kids' grandfather and a dad to you again.\n5. P.S. I do love the petty of saying your dad can pay for a destination family vacation/wedding if he wants to have you redo your wedding. But I personally just can't get past him stamping the ACTUAL wedding as improper. I can't even see giving your dad a role in a wedding RENEWAL. (Mainly because at a renewal, I don't see a role for FOB since this is not about going \"from the father's house to the husband's house\" but only re-iterating what was already established between the husband and the wife.\n6. ETA: Second P.S. Your post doesn't mention how your husband feels about the idea. I can't imagine considering anything that insults your husband. (And in your husband's shoes, I would consider it insulting that FOB thinks the critical guy to have at the wedding was FOB, not the groom.)", "NTA. You\u2019ve had your wedding & he chose not to be there. Not having the chance to walk you down the aisle is the consequence he\u2019s now got to deal with.

I don't know why OP is so keen on maintaining this relationship.", "[removed]", "Ask him what would be in it for you and the father of your children.", "Also is it even guilt or is it more fomo, entitlement or regret (but a selfish regret, not regret/guilt for having ditched his daughter)", "This! This is what I was going to suggest too. I know I want to do a vow renewal on our tenth wedding anniversary and do things differently (was guilt tripped into so many things we didn't want) maybe then he can show his respect", "The fact he still doesn't like your husband is making this all about him. It's his me me me situation.", "I was going to suggest something similar. Get him to pay for a whole other wedding and call it a vow renewal. Throw a kickass party on his dime.", "OP was 18/19 when giving birth to her first child with her husband, how old were they when they started going out together with a 4 year age gap?\n\nWhilst I don't agree with the father's behaviour I can imagine he wasn't enamored with the fact that his teenage daughter was going out with an adult at the start, what parent would be okay with that?\n\nHaving said that the father isn't owed a new wedding at all but it does go some way to explaining his behaviour and not approving of the relationship at the start", "How old were you when you started going out with your husband? You were  18 or 19 giving birth to your first child judging by the ages posted here\n\nA 4 year age gap when you were a teenager is something that a decent father would have an objection to.", "You could bargain that he needs to build a relationship with your husband before giving you away? You get an actual effort on his part, he gets a little less guilt.", "Indeed, she was a teenager dating a guy 4 years older, who knocked her up at 18. Which is when she needed her dad the most, and he chose to freeze her out instead. That says something about him, doesn't it? \n\nDisliking his teenage daughter's older boyfriend is perfectly acceptable. But punishing her for making her own choices is wrong. She would have been within her rights not to allow him back into her life after that. She forgave him (or maybe was gaslighted into thinking that HE forgave HER) and instead of appreciating the second chance, he's making crazy demands. All while still shitting on her choice of spouse, 17 years later.", "Yes, I can understand why he didn't like her husband when they first met - she was so young, plus the age gap, I certainly wouldn't be happy myself. However, it's proven to be a long term commited relationship, and he just need to accept he missed the wedding and move on.", "Like I said, I don't agree with the father's behaviour, only that I can understand him not wanting his daughter to be going out with and having a baby with an adult with a history of drug misuse (see OPs comments) when she was a teenager. Again I don't agree with her father's behavior but it helps to understand it", "Almost every behavior can be understood if you dig deep enough into a person's history. One could even find explanations for Hitler's behavior (even if most people in his situation would have chosen different paths). So there's really no reason to say that you \"understand\" unless you're low-key trying to justify it. \"I understand but don't agree\" is a pointless phrase.", "Even courts of justice in most developed countries attempt to understand the motivation behind criminal behaviour to determine appropriate sentencing", "NTA.  The wedding was already proper.  Don't reward bad behavior.  Tell your dad that you're sad he wasn't at the wedding, but he's got grandchildren he can focus on for now and try to move away from the topic altogether.  He should feel the consequences of his actions, not get to have a do-over.", "NTA your dad had his head in the sand and only pulled his head out when he finally realized he didn\u2019t like the taste of it.", "NAH. Your dad is a bit of the AH for taking out his anger on a child who didn\u2019t deserve it but I don\u2019t blame him for being disgusted with a grown man dating a minor and then getting her pregnant before she even turned 20. \n\nI\u2019m glad the relationship is better now.", "That sound as a stupid idea, your dad is going seniel, He messed up and know he need to regret his stupid actions. NTA if you say no.", "Info: How old were you when you and your husband got together", "NTA.", "Consider telling your father that his animosity toward your husband stops any discussion about what your dad missed. Your husband is not a stage extra.  He is the man you love, father of your children and a much abused target of your dad\u2019s hostility. Tell dad, you too regret his absence but you still have painful memories of the way he treated you, your oldest child, your husband and lastly you. You can\u2019t get a redo. Tell him your wedding day was the day you stopped trying.  Now any regrets are on him.", "NTA.  I'm a very petty b\\*tch (or A H) and this is what I'd do.  Tell your dad you'll have a wedding re-do if he pays for it ALL then don't show up.  Just because he is showing up now doesn't mean he gets what he wants.  He should've been there 12 years ago!", "A wedding is like virginity\u2026you can\u2019t redo it. NTA.", "NTA. You don't need to put yourself through the stress of another wedding so that your father can reduce his guilt and fulfil his whim. I am assuming he would want you guys to foot the bill too.  No point in undertaking such expensive financial repercussions when you have four kids and better things to financially plan for.", "NTA. He lost his change, when he didn't show up. Redoing it just for his benefit would be a waste. \n\nBut if you want to do something like renew your marriage vows - maybe at an anniversary - you could make some small ceremony. But you definitly don't have to. Just if you want to do something like that. Maybe with a small holiday combination - would your father pay for it?", ">I can tell it would mean a lot to him \n\nAnd it meant a lot to him at the time to skip your wedding. He didn't give a shit about your feelings then and it meant a lot to you that he wasn't there because he didn't want to be. A lot of bad stuff that is. Daddy is still a selfish ass. There is a childhood saying. No takebacks. Oh wait! He still can barely be polite to your husband, so he isn't even trying for a full takeback. NTA", "NTA but dies your husband even have a say in this madness?", "If you are in the US, NAH your dad has every right to not like the 21 year old who was dating his underage daughter. And has a reason to be upset that his daughter got pregnant at 19 to someone who could be called a preditor for dating a minor. \n\nThat being said, unless you and your husband want to renew your vows, there is not need to \"redo\" a wedding. Explain to him he can't go back and fix it but if you do renew your vows he can do it then.", "Honestly, this should be your hill to die on. His response to his daughter have kids at a very young age was withdraw all forms of support. He needs to live with the consequences of that decision. One is that he chose not to walk you down the aisle. NTA", "NTA\n\nYou had your wedding. You made your vows. Your dad chose not to be there. You are not required to have a second one, just so the man who ditched his daughter and grandchildren for years can live out the dream he destroyed.", "NTA\n\nThat's a mistake he's going to have to live with\n\nYou don't owe him another chance", "Tell him you'll do it if he pays since it's his own fault he wasn't there the first time", "NTA, and this is a stupid request.\n\nAsk him if he'd like for you to give birth to Kyle again, so that he can be a better grandfather. \n\nAsk him if he'd like to go back in time and approve of your husband, and support and love you as a couple.\n\nNeither is possible, nor is redoing a life event (your wedding). \n\nTell him that the only way he can be in your lives is what he's doing now. Sadly he can apologize and have regrets but he can't fix what he did.\n\nMaybe that's all that needs to be done - a sincere apology to you and your husband.", "NTA", "NTA this is a bizarre request that you have no reason to indulge. If you ever do a vow renewal, sure, involve him, but this is the bed he made for himself.", "OP, that ship has sailed. In this life, sadly, there are no do-overs. It's for him to make peace with it.\n\nNTA", "NTA he made his choice. Don't do any more than you're already doing just to appease him. It's his fault he ruined his relationship with his daughter. He's very lucky you decided to give him another chance. \n\nIf he wants to throw you and pay for a vow renewal or anniversary party would you be open to that?", "NTA\n\nAbove the other problems, the simple idea is insulting. Which says to me he has not changed.", "NTA and if your dad regrets his refusal to be a part of your wedding, good. Guilt is sometimes a good reminder not to act like a jerk in the future.", "Dad is doing this for him, not for you. You had a wedding. He had an opportunity but was so busy being sad on his high-horse that he missed the big picture. If, in the future, you and hubs decide to have a recommitment ceremony, you can decide if you want dad to walk you down the aisle. You are NTA.", "NTA. His guilt is his issue to deal with. \n\nAnd he's still being selfish. He tried manipulating you and then punished you when you didn't give in. Now, he's trying to make his bad feelings your problem to solve again. Tell him to take the second wedding money and put it into therapy instead.", ">how he thinks we should redo the wedding \u201cproperly\u201d.\n\nWith what money and who would even attend? NTA.", "Yeah but that\u2019s probably not what OP\u2019s dad wants, he wants the big dress and tux kind of wedding.", "I was 17 when we started dating and he was 21 but I didn't get pregnant til I was nearly 19", "I don't think she wants that kind of relationship with him.", "Any idea why your dad was so hostile to your husband; why he remains hostile?  Is it about you finding a mate?", "Might have to do with the fact husband dated her while she was a minor (and he wasn\u2019t), and then got her pregnant before marriage and before she turned 20.", ">I can't even consider it when he still doesn't support my relationship\n\nExactly. He wants to play pretend. He's the only one to get anything out of this. I would straight up ask him \"why are we doing this if you don't even support the marriage? So you can pretend to be the loving father I needed, instead of the crybaby AH who threw a tantrum and couldn't even be there for me now. Is this because you need to pretend to be a good dad, because a good dad would work on his relationship with MY LIFE PARTNER\"", "I was 17 but Kyle wasn't born until I was 19", "Yeah, I'm curious about the \"few things that reflect\" his troubled upbringing that the husband is judged for-are these minor, inconsequential things or something that reflects poorly on his behavior? And I think it's okay to be concerned about your daughter having a partner that-for all she knows that's probably based solely on what he told her-had minor drug problems. Like, if it was just MJ or something, fine, not really a big deal. But what if it wasn't? What exactly constitutes as minor for OP?\n\nAnd the age gap is definitely worrisome. If they started dating when she was a minor, that's ick. And if they started dating at 19 and she quickly got pregnant, that wouldn't be great either. It feels like OP isn't really addressing specific things-what exactly has her dad said about her husband? Why did her dad dislike some of the issues she brought up?", "His actions were fair at the start but he lost all credibility not attending the wedding", "My husband doesn't have a great past so my Dad didn't approve, he didn't think he was good enough. He also didn't like the age gap when we started dating", "I can see where your father's original complaints about him began to be honest but he has no right to ask you to have a do over wedding or to have treated you so poorly for years after your husband probed himself", "Gotcha"]}
