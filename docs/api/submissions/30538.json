Why would you spend all that time, money and energy to recreate something that doesn't need recreating just to sooth one man's guilt?", "NTA\n\nYou've been with your husband over 16 years; whatever your Dad's hangups, your husband has staying power.  So, your Dad was/is wrong about Hubby.\n\nAnd, your Dad's issues about missing your wedding are the consequences of his own behavior.  You already had a wedding.  He chose to be petulant and skip it.  He can regret his choices and actions, but there's no do-over offered.  No.  Maybe Dad should rethink his behavior in the future when he's offered similar opportunities.  Like, if he doesn't like their future spouse, maybe he'll still attend your kids' future weddings.  This is a learning opportunity for Dad; your wedding was a once in a lifetime event and he chose to skip it.  So, he can stop complaining.", "NTA-His regrets don\u2019t mean you should have to do a do over to make up for his actions.", "NTA. Your dad has to accept that he fucked up and he can't take that back by walking you down the aisle 10+ years after the fact. Now if you and your husband wanted to have a vow renewal someday, and you wanted you dad to walk you down that aisle or participate some way, that would be one thing.... but to throw a whole wedding \"redo\" just because he has regrets about **his choice** to not attend? Nope!", "NTA.  He chose not to be there for you at the time, and now he wants a do-over.  This wedding sequel would be for *his* benefit.  If you guys decide to renew your vows, sure, go for it.  He can make things up to you by being an involved father/grandfather.", "Your father is experiencing the consequence of his actions,  as you said. It's not your job to protect him from those consequences.  NTA.", "NTA.   If you both choose to do a vow renewal at any time, maybe he could  part in that.  Otherwise to bad. \n\n Everyone has regrets big or small. This is his. He can learn to live with it instead of making you and others go to huge lengths to fix his stupid. The fact he still doesn't like your husband is making this all about him.  It's his me me me situation.", "INFO: Has your Dad offered to pay for this redo wedding? \n\nI happen to agree that the idea is stupid and your father deserves the regret of not having gotten to walk you down the aisle. The thing is, if would make him happy, cost you nothing but time, and continue to improve your relationship, maybe it's not such a bad thing. However, I will also acknowledge, however, I can also see this backfiring since you will have friends and family who may see this as gift-grabbing and your father may see your original wedding as invalid which could harm your relationship.", "Hold up. You got married over a decade ago and your **dad** needs a redo?***I\u2019m pretty sure that vow renewals are at the behest of the couple, not some entitled outsider who shunned the relationship. **NTA**", "Info: Why the animosity towards your husband? There's \"I don't like the guy my kid is dating\" and then there is \"I don't like that guy so much that I will completely pull myself out of her life and stay away from my grandkids.\"\n\nIt feels like something really big.", "NTA.\n\nYou just can't recapture that moment. He could walk you down the aisle as a 30something woman who has already been a wife and mom for 15 years. It's not the same. Not the same as the proper wedding you already had.\n\nSo your husband has been a mainstay in your life for around 17 years now. Your dad was a constant in your life for about 19 years before shutting you out. That's pretty close in duration. One cut you off when things got tough. The other stepped up and committed to being your partner. I think the compare and contrast was interesting. \n\nIt's good that he's coming around, but like others said, this is just the consequence of his actions that he has to accept.", "I'm guessing your 15th wedding anniversary is the next big milestone. I would suggest either for your 15th, 20th or 25th anniversary that you could renew your vows and have a small ceremony where he could walk you down the aisle. It's his own fault that he missed the wedding. Asking you to redo the whole wedding would be stupid. A vow renewal is the next best thing and perfect compromise to this situation.\n\nNTA", "NTA. You are already properly married. It is your father's own fault that he wasn't present. It is very disrespecting of him to ask you to be married \"properly\".", "Would your husband want to do it?", "NTA. He has regrets but they are selfish. He\u2019s the one that missed the wedding because of his own behavior. We can\u2019t go back in time, even if you wanted to, it would be totally different and it would be a sham, in his head it maybe is perfect but in reality the moment is gone. Congrats on your happy family tho", "NTA! at all and I would tell him if he wants a wedding redo so badly he can pay for every penny of it since it was his fault in the first place not going to your actual wedding to begin with.", "I'm just wondering, is he offering to pay for it? Or is he suggesting that you *literally pay for his mistake* by having another wedding at your own expense?\n\nEither way, NTA.", "NTA. He can't rewrite history. As a parent, he knows that actions have consequences. Now he is facing them. Don't even entertain this idiocy. You're not less married because your angry dad refused to walk you down the aisle. You won't be more married if you renew your vows now.", "NTA Actions have consequences. The consequences of boycotting your child\u2019s wedding are, weirdly enough, that you miss your child\u2019s wedding.

You already had your wedding.  You invited your dad.  He acted like a jackass and showed you that you weren't important enough for him to attend.  Now he's got his head out of his rear, & wants you to do something so he'll feel better about himself?  I thinks not.", "NTA You love him, but you're already married. He can't just reverse time and walk you down your aisle. That's a regret he'll have to live with.\n\nThat being said he is trying to be sweet, so maybe extend an olive branch and... I dunno, arrange a family photoshoot or something. There's never enough family shots and babies are a perfect time to get a new one with grandparents.", "NTA. Your and your husband\u2019s wedding day was a once in a lifetime event. There is no need to redo anything about that wedding.", "NTA - I wouldn\u2019t be willing to do this in any form.

We all have regrets, some bigger than others and we have to live with them. You\u2019re a nicer person than I am - your eldest was subjected to 4 years of being ignored by his grandfather and I know I wouldn\u2019t forgive someone who treated my child the way your dad treated yours.", "Instead of giving you away, he abandoned you. He doesn't deserve a re-do on a decision like that. \n\nNTA", "NTA - honestly it would just be super weird to do a vow renewal or \"second wedding\" for your... dad?", "NTA\nYou\u2019re not responsible for his guilt and he\u2019s not still happy with your husband. The nerve. He should feel fortunate you\u2019re so forgiving.", "NTA. Actions have consequences that cannot be undone: your father living with the regret of missing your wedding and losing out on walking you down the aisle (because he cared more at the time about spiting your choice of husband than loving you,) is his.  \nIf he throws his relationship with you away *again* because you refuse to cater to his feelings, then he wasn't worth patching things up with in the first place.", "NTA \n\nTell him you understand his regret about *that moment in time that is unchangeable*\n\nAsk him if he can understand the hurt that he inflicted on you, your husband and his oldest grandson, for the four years, and that it took one of your kids almost dying to bring him around to just *civil*. \n\nAsk him what would be in it for you and the father of your children.... The man that has l loved and supported both you and your kids for almost 2 decades..... to have a do over wedding *for him*. \n\nWhen he walks you down the aisle.... to hand you to your husband, can he so it with an open heart and all the love and respect deserving of his SIL and the father of his grandchildren?\n\nOr not \n\nBut I would", "NTA\n\nI think you're being reasonable here. You did try your best. And you're not wrong. But if budget is not a problem, i would encourage you to fulfill your father's wish... I mean, he sounds like a good father so you don't want to regret...
