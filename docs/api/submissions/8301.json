Recently Ellie came to me about how she changed her mind, she didn\u2019t want to try to get custody because she was wanting her dating life. she said her boyfriend didn\u2019t want her to adopt her siblings. I can\u2019t just take on 8 kids if we did accomplish custody, but she could help and it would work, so I asked her to think it through more. \n\nShe just said she couldn\u2019t give a flying crap what i did with our siblings, she wanted to make her bf happy. I know she\u2019s made her decision but I just don\u2019t think it\u2019s the right one. I asked her to think more carefully about it and she just lost it and said I should leave them alone too, it would make me a better person. I felt shocked she would say that, so I said she should stop to think about how our siblings would grow up as we did if we didn\u2019t do anything so she should just think for what\u2019s better for our siblings.

I can see both sides of the argument and both have merit. I can see how your sister's boyfriend doesn't want to raise 8 kids that aren't his and I can also see why your sister wants to start living her life, but you are not TA because you want to get your siblings out of a bad situation. NAH just sad stuff.", "NAH. I don't think either of you are assholes necessarily. I think you're both processing and coping with trauma in different ways. If your parents are abusing your siblings (especially if you have documented evidence of said abuse), you should absolutely contact CPS and report it. Don't wait, especially if there's SA, neglect or physical abuse involved, the kids could be in danger. I totally understand why you feel that the responsibility of taking and raising your siblings is on you. You and Ellie have been parentified for most of your lives and spent years carrying the weight of caring for kids you didn't choose to have. That never should have happened. Your parents conditioned you to feel responsible for them and I'm sure you love them all very much. I get why you still feel that they're your responsibility. But they're not.\n\nYour sister isn't wrong for being unwilling to shoulder the massive responsibility of raising her 8 siblings into adulthood just because your parents are unfit to care for their own children. She finally broke free and I'd bet it would be detrimental to her mental health to go back to that place. (Not your parents home, but back to the role of caregiver.) It's not her responsibility either. If you continue to push her after she clearly and firmly expressed that she doesn't want to, you will be TA.\n\nIf your siblings aren't safe with mom and dad, there are alternative options. If CPS determines that they should be removed from the home, they'll find (a) suitable home(s) for them. Foster care isn't always ideal, but sometimes it's better than staying with parents who aren't capable of providing adequate care. Honestly, unless you're established and extremely financially stable with a huge home, it's likely you won't be granted custody of all 8 of them yourself. But like I said, it isn't your responsibility. \n\nMy heart is with you and your siblings. I hope you and Ellie are able to heal and undo any damage your upbringing caused you. If you haven't already, please consider looking into therapy. Sometimes we don't even realize how badly circumstances fuck us up until we face them head on and gain insight from an outside perspective. Good luck. And please try not to be too hard on your sister. She's taking care of herself. Something it sounds like she's never had the opportunity to do in the past. I hope you're able to do the same.", "YTA\n\nYour intentions are good but after how you describe your childhood she also deserves her own life and to make her own decisions.", "YTA but I say that gently. It's admirable that you want to help your siblings, but you can't put that on her. She's already sacrificed a lot of her life to parent them, it's not the slightest bit selfish to want to live her life for herself now. She's said her position on the matter, now you need to let it go. You have no right to try and pressure or guilt her on it. It doesn't  make you much better than your parents to expect her to raise these children, even if your heart is in the right place.", "Yta - don't force parenthood on anyone. 23 is young let her live. \n\nAlso, you said she has trauma, you and her have the parenting skills of your parents and would need to put an incredible amount of effort in to not repeat those patterns. She may not be up to it. \n\nShe isn't responsible for your siblings. If you can do it that's amazing but if you can't that's okay. You have to live your life too.", "At this point NAH I think. I get where you are coming from but at this point you've asked her to reconsider and now need to stop because this is not something she is wanting for her own reasons. That is a LOT to ask someone to take on and yes they're your siblings it will also change her life forever and she will never get to have her own life really. Shes probably pretty freaked out at the thought especially at yalls age.", "NAH. You are admirable for wanting to step up for your siblings and your sister has every right to not want to be a parent right now. I hope you and your sister also get extensive, intensive, consistent therapy to unpack the trauma you both have. Good luck on your future endeavors!", "YTA. I am sympathetic for your feelings and thoughts, but you became the asshole when you told her to solely think what is better for her siblings. You are asking her to sacrifice her life for your siblings, but she also deserves to live her life *away and independently from them*. \n\nYou are not respecting her choices, and you are trying to force her into a situation she no longer wishes to insert herself in.\n\nYou have different things in life. Please respect that.", "YTA\n\nYour sister is allowed to live her life. She already lost her childhood to your parent's nonsense she should be allowed to chart her own future. \n\nI get that you want to rescue your siblings but that's actually not your job. It's an awesome instinct but it isn't a requirement. So your sister can choose to opt out. Do what you can. Be there for your siblings but allow your sister to make a different choice.", "YTA\n\nYour sister is telling you she can't take your siblings in with you. She's not equipped to raise them. It's brave of her to realise and say that. The fact that you want to continue putting pressure on her is not OK.", "NAH -  By insisting that your sister continue this pursuit to take joint custody of 8 younger children, you are essentially doing the same thing your parents did.  She has every right to want her own life.  And of course you can't handle all of that on your own and frankly you shouldn't try.  If you want to help your sibs, focus your efforts on working with protective services to make sure your sibs are being cared for properly.  You say your parents were strict, but were they actually abusive? Is harm being done?  Let the professionals help here rather than trying to shoulder the entire load.", "YTA dude, just let her live her life. She said no, and that's well that. Its not selfish that she doesn't want them or the responsibility after already living most her life doing it.", "NTA but neither is your sister.  You will be if you continue to push the issue with her.  You and your sister have had an unfair hand dealt.  I understand  your priority is to get custody but it sounds like her priority is her self preservation. Both are equally important.  Do what you can to help your siblings but you should extend her some grace.\n\nAs for her boyfriend, his priority should be to help and emotionally support your sister.  If she isn't emotionally equipping to handle them, it would be equally damaging to push her into it.\n\nOP, Best wishes on you and your family's future.", "YTA\n\nYour sister deserves to live her own life now. She's gone through trauma, has acted as a parent for most of her life and now you want her to commit to being a guardian for the next 16 years. I understand that you want to protect the young ones and that is your choice. But to guilt your sister into parenting all her siblings is pulling a move right out of your parents playbook. \n\nTime to let her live her own life how she wants.", "YTA  \n\n\nI understand your wish to take your siblings and take care of them yourself, but you are too young for that kind of responsibility, my advice to you...Let them come to you on their own when they're ready to leave the family home themselves. Just let them know the door is open if and when they're ready. Do you have the means to support them all? Do you have the means right now to support yourself adequately? A home big enough for them? You have to look at this realistically for the time being. Your sister has been set free now, she wants to find her own place in the world and for the time being not look back, do not begrudge her that.   \nI would use this time you have to get yourself more financially established, working with a purchased home. Make a plan for if and when they do start showing up at your door.", "There has to be some story as to why there is such a huge gap between you and your twin, and the rest of the children?", "NAH Not what I would personally do but she absolutely has the right to make the choice and deal with the trauma in her own way. You have the right intentions and just want some help with 8 kids under 12, completely understandable. I hope you are still able to help your siblings, and I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re in this situation.", "YTA\n\nYou and your sister are young and deserve to have lives.\n\nYou don\u2019t state that your parents abuse your siblings, maybe some neglect because of the number of them and the implied parentification of you and your twin\u2026 but that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean they are abused.", "NTA - As unusual as this situation is, you're describing a fight between siblings, which is part of being siblings. I think you're wasting your time trying to talk your sister into what you want, but that's between you two. I vote AH for the boyfriend who has no business getting involved in your relationship with your sister.", "YTA. You were both parentified and Ellie wants to do what people her age do and live her life for herself rather than be responsible for her siblings and watch herself around restrictive religious parents.", "NTA, as you're only trying to do the best for your siblings, but I also understand where your sister is coming from. She's only young, and it sounds like neither of you got much of a childhood, so it's completely understandable that she wants to enjoy her freedom from responsibilities for a while - adopting kids, even if they're your siblings and you'd be rescuing them from a bad situation, is a huge deal.", "NTA. Neither is your sister. It\u2019s the bf. Really sounds like the only reason she\u2019s changed her mind is because he told her to, not to mention he sounds controlling affffff", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

As someone with religious trauma idgaf about your parents. They are disgusting and remind me of the fucking duggars. \n\nMaybe talk with her more and get CPS involved if you can.

It would not go well. You need to understand she's feeling intense panic at what she likely sees as being dragged back into a miserable life. She isn't speaking from a calm perspective so she's saying some extreme things out of sheer desperation. Your original plan isn't viable, I'm sorry about that, but you need to focus on finding a new plan.", "NTA, Now I am not here to try to give context on a situation I have no idea about\u2026 but to me those could be the starting signs of an abusive relationship. \n\n\n  In my personal experience the relationship I chose after I got out of my abusive household\u2026They we\u2019re not good and we\u2019re also abusive. Isolating is typically the first sign and your sister is vulnerable. I would try to give you advice here but I simply think I am really not qualified.   \n\n\n   I wish you the best you are a wonderful sister and I\u2019m sure your sister will pull through for you!", "I agree with your judgment of NAH, but I would be cautious with your estimation of CPS. \n\nI work in the system, for anonymity I won\u2019t say specifically where but it\u2019s roughly with some children who\u2019ve been placed here, and have experience with reporting the neglect of a younger friend and her siblings. \n\nSo CPS has many flaws, in the name of preventing families from needlessly separated and protecting family units from false reports. Both of those goals are good noble goals but unfortunately, it leads to cracks in the system. \n\nFor a situation like OPs, where there is abuse, they know it, they\u2019ve lived it, it is 100% absolutely a thing, those things that are protections in other situations are actually problems. In Iowa for example, CPS will warn a family if there\u2019s an accusation and tell them roughly when they\u2019ll be stopping by to check on things. My friends parents got warning and cleaned up and put on a show for CPS. This meant despite the kids living in a house where dogs were shitting everywhere and where the parents were on drugs, the kids were not removed. \n\nBecause the parents get warning, they can cut people off that they suspect of being too sympathetic to their children and of filing the report. \n\nFurther, CPS\u2019s goal is familial reunification. So removing the kids isn\u2019t going to be their first choice without a hell of a lot of evidence and without the younger siblings\u2019 corroborating OP\u2019s claims unless there\u2019s a ton of irrefutable evidence. OP needs damning evidence that is conclusive that their parents are not good parents before going to CPS with anything, because CPS will make a home visit, the parents will be notified, and since abusers also tend to be master manipulators, it could just worsen their siblings\u2019 situation at home. \n\nAlso the sisters boyfriend may or may not be a red flag. He seems like he could fall into either being controlling and abusive himself (which the sister is at risk for growing up as she did) or just super protective of her. It\u2019s not clear which.", "Boyfriend might actually know more than OP about how the sister is really feeling and is stepping up for the sister to protect her. Because look how sister talking with OP went; guilt tripping and pushing for her agenda by OP.", "Boyfriend sets off some alarm bells for me, texting OP to never talk to her sister again straight off the bat. It\u2019s coming off like he\u2019s trying to isolate her ASAP. \n\nAnd while I understand it\u2019s a lot for him, and he doesn\u2019t want to sign on for 8 kids, she was full steam ahead until he showed up and started whispering in her ear. They should break up, instead of her abandoning her family and life she was working towards just for him. If he doesn\u2019t fit into the life she\u2019s building, he LEAVES, not take control of her life and family relationships. \n\nI dunno, he just comes off as bad news.", "Yes. we know for a fact there\u2019s not a good living situation for them but we don\u2019t have enough proof yet to get them out", "Eh, it could be. \n\nIt's far more likely though that her bf is not in a position to take on 8 kids ranging from toddler/preschool age to teenagers. (Like most people. I don't know anyone personally who is financially, mentally and emotionally equipped to do so, honestly.) And now that she's had a taste of freedom and found a partner she cares about, she's realizing that's not what she wants either. Then when she expressed that, OP tried to force her hand. It's completely within the realm of possibility that Ellie wanted her bf to relay the message to OP that she doesn't want future contact because she doesn't want to be pressured and guilted into raising her siblings to adulthood. Both OP and Ellie have already spent the majority of their youth parenting their siblings, it's reasonable and fair to not want to continue to do so until they're almost 40.", "He might be an ah but it could also be they finally discussed it and he said he can't do it. Or she isn't mentally able to handle it. No one knows. As for his texts to op sorry I side with him. She said no and op kept pushing telling her she's in the wrong. Doing what their parents did. Trying to force something she may have realized she can't do again.

She\u2019s escaped being responsible for eight siblings, and presumably dealing with the mental health issues that her upbringing came with. Now OP wants her to help be responsible for them again, and calls her selfish for actually wanting her own life.", "I understand. \n\nNAH - I think you and your sister went through what sounds like an extremely difficult childhood. Your response is valid, but so is hers (which, fwiw, sounds like a trauma response). Your sister may have used harsh words (I'm sure she does care about your siblings) but asking her to adopt and parent your siblings when it sounds like neither of you got to have a normal childhood is a lot and not something you can choose for her.\n\nSorry you're going through this.", "Call CPS and explain to them what you went through, and what you know of the abuse in the house. Let them try to find evidence.", "It could be that but from what I read it seems they would be splitting the kids as op states she cannot take all 8\u2026 and I understand not wanting to take on 4 kids in your relationship but as the boyfriend you need to realize that your needs in that situation are not more important then the needs of your girlfriend\u2019s family. \n\nIf your relationship doesn\u2019t fit with your goals and your lives don\u2019t fit together that\u2019s it find someone else who does don\u2019t pressure the other person to cut off their family. \n  \n\nI get where the sister is coming from because I\u2019m living it or something incredibly similar except my brother will literally never be able to take care of himself ever \u2026 I also don\u2019t know even where to start to give advice in this because well I\u2019m not looking down the barrel of 8 kids \n\n\n The boyfriends reaction to me is just weird my boyfriend when I told him about my brother and how I would probably have to take care of him in a few years for the rest of my life was like \u201cWell when that happens we will figure it out\u201d", "That\u2019s the flip side to the coin. Could be she felt bull-dozed by OP this whole time and bf is getting her to stand up for herself. I did say \u201cI dunno\u201d at the end lol He just sounds icky, but we are only getting one side of the story, too.", "I'm thinking that the way OP reacted and resulted to guilt tripping hasn't made it easy for the sister to voice her opinions or objections."]}
