I can see both sides of the argument and both have merit. I can see how your sister's boyfriend doesn't want to raise 8 kids that aren't his and I can also see why your sister wants to start living her life, but you are not TA because you want to get your siblings out of a bad situation. NAH just sad stuff.", "NAH. I don't think either of you are assholes necessarily. I think you're both processing and coping with trauma in different ways. If your parents are abusing your siblings (especially if you have documented evidence of said abuse), you should absolutely contact CPS and report it. Don't wait, especially if there's SA, neglect or physical abuse involved, the kids could be in danger. I totally understand why you feel that the responsibility of taking and raising your siblings is on you. You and Ellie have been parentified for most of your lives and spent years carrying the weight of caring for kids you didn't choose to have. That never should have happened. Your parents conditioned you to feel responsible for them and I'm sure you love them all very much. I get why you still feel that they're your responsibility. But they're not.\n\nYour sister isn't wrong for being unwilling to shoulder the massive responsibility of raising her 8 siblings into adulthood just because your parents are unfit to care for their own children. She finally broke free and I'd bet it would be detrimental to her mental health to go back to that place. (Not your parents home, but back to the role of caregiver.) It's not her responsibility either. If you continue to push her after she clearly and firmly expressed that she doesn't want to, you will be TA.\n\nIf your siblings aren't safe with mom and dad, there are alternative options. If CPS determines that they should be removed from the home, they'll find (a) suitable home(s) for them. Foster care isn't always ideal, but sometimes it's better than staying with parents who aren't capable of providing adequate care. Honestly, unless you're established and extremely financially stable with a huge home, it's likely you won't be granted custody of all 8 of them yourself. But like I said, it isn't your responsibility. \n\nMy heart is with you and your siblings. I hope you and Ellie are able to heal and undo any damage your upbringing caused you. If you haven't already, please consider looking into therapy. Sometimes we don't even realize how badly circumstances fuck us up until we face them head on and gain insight from an outside perspective. Good luck. And please try not to be too hard on your sister. She's taking care of herself. Something it sounds like she's never had the opportunity to do in the past. I hope you're able to do the same.", "YTA\n\nYour intentions are good but after how you describe your childhood she also deserves her own life and to make her own decisions.", "YTA but I say that gently. It's admirable that you want to help your siblings, but you can't put that on her. She's already sacrificed a lot of her life to parent them, it's not the slightest bit selfish to want to live her life for herself now. She's said her position on the matter, now you need to let it go. You have no right to try and pressure or guilt her on it. It doesn't  make you much better than your parents to expect her to raise these children, even if your heart is in the right place.", "Yta - don't force parenthood on anyone. 23 is young let her live. \n\nAlso, you said she has trauma, you and her have the parenting skills of your parents and would need to put an incredible amount of effort in to not repeat those patterns. She may not be up to it. \n\nShe isn't responsible for your siblings. If you can do it that's amazing but if you can't that's okay. You have to live your life too.", "At this point NAH I think. I get where you are coming from but at this point you've asked her to reconsider and now need to stop because this is not something she is wanting for her own reasons. That is a LOT to ask someone to take on and yes they're your siblings it will also change her life forever and she will never get to have her own life really. Shes probably pretty freaked out at the thought especially at yalls age.", "NAH. You are admirable for wanting to step up for your siblings and your sister has every right to not want to be a parent right now. I hope you and your sister also get extensive, intensive, consistent therapy to unpack the trauma you both have. Good luck on your future endeavors!", "YTA. I am sympathetic for your feelings and thoughts, but you became the asshole when you told her to solely think what is better for her siblings. You are asking her to sacrifice her life for your siblings, but she also deserves to live her life *away and independently from them*. \n\nYou are not respecting her choices, and you are trying to force her into a situation she no longer wishes to insert herself in.\n\nYou have different things in life. Please respect that.", "YTA\n\nYour sister is allowed to live her life. She already lost her childhood to your parent's nonsense she should be allowed to chart her own future. \n\nI get that you want to rescue your siblings but that's actually not your job. It's an awesome instinct but it isn't a requirement. So your sister can choose to opt out. Do what you can. Be there for your siblings but allow your sister to make a different choice.", "YTA\n\nYour sister is telling you she can't take your siblings in with you. She's not equipped to raise them. It's brave of her to realise and say that. The fact that you want to continue putting pressure on her is not OK.", "NAH -  By insisting that your sister continue this pursuit to take joint custody of 8 younger children, you are essentially doing the same thing your parents did.  She has every right to want her own life.  And of course you can't handle all of that on your own and frankly you shouldn't try.  If you want to help your sibs, focus your efforts on working with protective services to make sure your sibs are being cared for properly.  You say your parents were strict, but were they actually abusive? Is harm being done?  Let the professionals help here rather than trying to shoulder the entire load.", "YTA dude, just let her live her life. She said no, and that's well that. Its not selfish that she doesn't want them or the responsibility after already living most her life doing it.", "NTA but neither is your sister.  You will be if you continue to push the issue with her.  You and your sister have had an unfair hand dealt.  I understand  your priority is to get custody but it sounds like her priority is her self preservation. Both are equally important.  Do what you can to help your siblings but you should extend her some grace.\n\nAs for her boyfriend, his priority should be to help and emotionally support your sister.  If she isn't emotionally equipping to handle them, it would be equally damaging to push her into it.\n\nOP, Best wishes on you and your family's future.", "YTA\n\nYour sister deserves to live her own life now. She's gone through trauma, has acted as a parent for most of her life and now you want her to commit to being a guardian for the next 16 years. I understand that you want to protect the young ones and that is your choice. But to guilt your sister into parenting all her siblings is pulling a move right out of your parents playbook. \n\nTime to let her live her own life how she wants.", "YTA  \n\n\nI understand your wish to take your siblings and take care of them yourself, but you are too young for that kind of responsibility, my advice to you...Let them come to you on their own when they're ready to leave the family home themselves. Just let them know the door is open if and when they're ready. Do you have the means to support them all? Do you have the means right now to support yourself adequately? A home big enough for them? You have to look at this realistically for the time being. Your sister has been set free now, she wants to find her own place in the world and for the time being not look back, do not begrudge her that.   \nI would use this time you have to get yourself more financially established, working with a purchased home. Make a plan for if and when they do start showing up at your door.", "There has to be some story as to why there is such a huge gap between you and your twin, and the rest of the children?", "NAH Not what I would personally do but she absolutely has the right to make the choice and deal with the trauma in her own way. You have the right intentions and just want some help with 8 kids under 12, completely understandable. I hope you are still able to help your siblings, and I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re in this situation.", "YTA\n\nYou and your sister are young and deserve to have lives.\n\nYou don\u2019t state that your parents abuse your siblings, maybe some neglect because of the number of them and the implied parentification of you and your twin\u2026 but that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean they are abused.", "NTA - As unusual as this situation is, you're describing a fight between siblings, which is part of being siblings. I think you're wasting your time trying to talk your sister into what you want, but that's between you two. I vote AH for the boyfriend who has no business getting involved in your relationship with your sister.", "YTA. You were both parentified and Ellie wants to do what people her age do and live her life for herself rather than be responsible for her siblings and watch herself around restrictive religious parents.", "NTA, as you're only trying to do the best for your siblings, but I also understand where your sister is coming from. She's only young, and it sounds like neither of you got much of a childhood, so it's completely understandable that she wants to enjoy her freedom from responsibilities for a while - adopting kids, even if they're your siblings and you'd be rescuing them from a bad situation, is a huge deal.", "NTA.

Isolating is typically the first sign and your sister is vulnerable. I would try to give you advice here but I simply think I am really not qualified.   \n\n\n   I wish you the best you are a wonderful sister and I\u2019m sure your sister will pull through for you!", "I agree with your judgment of NAH, but I would be cautious with your estimation of CPS. \n\nI work in the system, for anonymity I won\u2019t say specifically where but it\u2019s roughly with some children who\u2019ve been placed here, and have experience with reporting the neglect of a younger friend and her siblings. \n\nSo CPS has many flaws, in the name of preventing families from needlessly separated and protecting family units from false reports. Both of those goals are good noble goals but unfortunately, it leads to cracks in the system. \n\nFor a situation like OPs, where there is abuse, they know it, they\u2019ve lived it, it is 100% absolutely a thing, those things that are protections in other situations are actually problems. In Iowa for example, CPS will warn a family if there\u2019s an accusation and tell them roughly when they\u2019ll be stopping by to check on things. My friends parents got warning and cleaned up and put on a show for CPS. This meant despite the kids living in a house where dogs were shitting everywhere and where the parents were on drugs, the kids were not removed. \n\nBecause the parents get warning, they can cut people off that they suspect of being too sympathetic to their children and of filing the report. \n\nFurther, CPS\u2019s goal is familial reunification. So removing the kids isn\u2019t going to be their first choice without a hell of a lot of evidence and without the younger siblings\u2019 corroborating OP\u2019s claims unless there\u2019s a ton of irrefutable evidence. OP needs damning evidence that is conclusive that their parents are not good parents before going to CPS with anything, because CPS will make a home visit, the parents will be notified, and since abusers also tend to be master manipulators, it could just worsen their siblings\u2019 situation at home. \n\nAlso the sisters boyfriend may or may not be a red flag. He seems like he could fall into either being controlling and abusive himself (which the sister is at risk for growing up as she did) or just super protective of her. It\u2019s not clear which.", "Boyfriend might actually know more than OP about how the sister is really feeling and is stepping up for the sister to protect her.

It\u2019s coming off like he\u2019s trying to isolate her ASAP. \n\nAnd while I understand it\u2019s a lot for him, and he doesn\u2019t want to sign on for 8 kids, she was full steam ahead until he showed up and started whispering in her ear. They should break up, instead of her abandoning her family and life she was working towards just for him. If he doesn\u2019t fit into the life she\u2019s building, he LEAVES, not take control of her life and family relationships. \n\nI dunno, he just comes off as bad news.", "Yes. we know for a fact there\u2019s not a good living situation for them but we don\u2019t have enough proof yet to get them out", "Eh, it could be. \n\nIt's far more likely though that her bf is not in a position to take on 8 kids ranging from toddler/preschool age to teenagers.

And now that she's had a taste of freedom and found a partner she cares about, she's realizing that's not what she wants either. Then when she expressed that, OP tried to force her hand.

She wants to live her own life and she has a right to do so.", "YTA she has suffered parentificaction her entire childhood and now you are trying to trap her as an adult into more of the same. Shed lose her childhood and her twenties too She wants to at last have fun. Let her alone. She doesn't need to sacrifice her life for other people's kids she never chose to have. Stop guilt tripping her.", "Soft YTA\n\nAs good as your intentions are, you wouldn't take a no for a no and are following in your parents footsteps by burdening your sister with parenting your siblings.\n\nAnd as OP describes the trauma of raising their siblings, I don't see the boyfriends actions as isolating OPs sister from her family but protecting his GF from the source of her trauma.", "YTA", "Soft YTA. Yes it's good that you want to do something good for your siblings but at the same time you ask your sister to keep sacrificing her well being for them, the same thing that your parents did all these years.", "Sound like a strict Muslim family. If I\u2019m right i highly suggest you do the same as your sister.", "NTA\n\n\nBecause your sister literally said she is doing this to make her boyfriend happy.  It's not her choice", "Yeah not 8 children. And I really think sister never wanted to do it and the boyfriend has her back. \nIf OP wants to do it good for her but she and her sister spent a large part of their lives being the caretakers of their siblings she is probably done.", "Yta\n\nYou are trying to parentify her, because you want to be yhe parent to your siblings.  Leave her alone to live her life. With a pushy controlling attitude like yours those siblings will be no better off with you than they are with their parents", "Ever so gently, YTA. \n\nI am so sorry for the trauma that your sister and yourself and your word about your childhood, and while **your way of trying to work through that is adopting your siblings, it\u2019s also fine that your sister\u2018s way of dealing means that she finally gets to live the life that she wants to live.** \n\nBy making demands of her, and deciding that her life should be spent raising your siblings, **how are you any different than them?** At what point will she be able to live the life she wants? When it\u2019s convenient for everybody else? But isn\u2019t that the reason you all left in the first place?\n\nThis is an incredibly tough situation, and I\u2019m very very sorry, but she deserves to live her life as she wants as well.", "NAH. It\u2019s OK for your sister to want her own life. Taking on that many children in early 20s is an absolutely incredible burden. It\u2019s also OK for you to want to do that, but you should not shame your sister for making a different more healthy choice for herself. Neither of you are wrong. Try to be kind to each other.", "YTA.\n\nShe has trauma as you did. She didn\u2019t have a life for at least 12y when the older sibling born, she want to have it back. You are manipulating and guilt tripping as you parent did to both of you. Let her alone, she shouldn\u2019t have to keep stopping her life.", "NAH. This is a heartbreaking story and both sides are understandable. I wish you all the best op", "ESH. you for what you said and your parents for parentifying you and your twin sister.", "I won't call you TA, because i know your intentions for your siblings are more than good. And i hate that you and your twin was forced into parental roles. But, you guys really arent obligated to raise your siblings. Neither of you. 8 kids is ALOT. And if your twin has made the decision to not want to get custody of them, then you have to accept that. You both deserve to live your life how you guys want. Again, i applaud you for wanting to step in, but you cant force your sister. Let her live how she wants.", "YTA and don't inadvertently start acting like your parents, by trying to impose your will on her. If things are that bad, you'll need to contact authorities.", "Gentle YTA, bordering on N A H.  It is amazing that you want to protect and care for your sibling.  They should be rescued from any abuse.  But if you force your sister into a caregiver role, you are perpetuating the abuse that she suffered.  Maybe you don't think \"for her boyfriend\" is a good reason to refuse to take in four children, but it is her life and her decision.", "YTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\" I know she\u2019s made her decision but I just don\u2019t think it\u2019s the right one. I\" .. You do not gert a vote.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd: You are an Ah: First her parents abused her, and now that she finally has escaped, **YOU ARE an abusive Ah and JUST AS BAD AS YOUR PARENTS** trying to parentify her. These are NOT HER kids.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nShe is right to escape your parentrs AND YOU, and **going no contact with you is a GOOD choice. She needs to protect herself from your assholery.**", "So you say your parents made you substitute parents and you both have trauma from this, but here and now you're pretty much demanding she repeat the process this time with you insisting she be the substitute parent.\n\nI hate to tell you, but you're just becoming an abuser like your sister regardless of the positive nature of your motivation.\n\nYTA because you need to think yourself why you believe your sister should sacrifice herself just to support your goal in saving your siblings from what you're effectively doing to your sister right now.", "Yeah this. Your parents forced you both into a parental role. Which is wrong, but now you're trying to push her into one again, with way more responsibility to it. If you want to be involved or get custody that's your choice, but you can't force her to do it too.\nPushing after she said no made YTA.\nThough the idea that she doesn't want to get involved to \"make her bf happy\" is kind of ick. The decision should be for herself.", "I see how the title could be read that way, but OP is suggesting sister put aside her *feelings* about the abuse perpetuated by their parents, for the sake of the siblings.", "The boyfriend may also be motivated by alarm at seeing his girlfriend's sister trying to perpetuate the very abuse their parents inflicted upon them.  OP's trying to guilt her sister over this to get her to do it again.", "To me the abusive people sound more the parents and op that is guilt tripping her to be a mother of 4 at 23. The boyfriend is just realistic, her life would totally change and be put on hold until the siblings are old enough. She will be basic never live her life.", "The boyfriend does sound like a normal person. She didn\u2019t have a life now she can be finally happy op want to make her stop her life to be a mother to 4 kids at 23 for many years to come.", "I think she says it's to \"make her bf happy\" to not seem selfish because she didn't want to be responsable for her siblings but feels obligated. Some are really young and she'll have to take care of them for 16 years min. it's a lot. So sorry OP, you make your reasons to take your siblings but your sister can make her own decisions and you shouldn't make her feel bad about it.", "Any partner who tells you that you can't talk to your family, or who tells your family not to talk to you, is not normal. This is a disagreement between two sisters, bf has no reason to be involved or to be texting OP. \n\nUltimately, the decision is OP's sister's but not once in this account does OP say that her sister is expressing her own opinion or trying to live her own life. It's all about the boyfriend.\n\nIf this is an accurate depiction, OP should keep an eye on her sister. \n\nAnd people with kids have lives.", "Ellie is 23 and is just escaping her parent's control.  She hasn't had much time to figure things out. OP is exerting just as much pressure as the BF, so how is that not controlling? I agree it may possibly not be the healthiest relationship but all we have is OPs view of that and she clearly has her own agenda.", "The sister may have just speak with the bf and he may have express her doubt to her and show the manipulation.\n\nOp did insist in guilt tripping her, the bf told op to stop because she was just using their trauma to force her sister to do something. If a partner doesn\u2019t protect you from family abusing you then they are not good partner.\n\nYes people with kids have life, but not people with 4 kids at 23 that have been abused all their life.", "Yep.  OP is *actively* attempting to perpetuate the abuse already done by their parents, and laying a whole lot of guilt on sister for expressing any resistance to that.  Yeah, maybe there's a problem with the BF but I'm not 100% convinced of that on this basis alone.", "They both had said agenda until bf didn\u2019t like it. Every quote from Ellie suggests she changed her mind solely because bf gave her an ultimatum and not for her own mental health or future or etc. Yes, OP is pressuring her, but she\u2019s not being controlling. I never said both sisters were perfect, I said neither is TA. They\u2019re also the exact same age coming out of the exact same situation at the exact same time. Obviously people process things differently but the \u201cshe\u2019s young\u201d comments seem somewhat irrelevant considering OP is at a perfectly identical age coming out of a perfectly identical situation.\n\nI had a near-identical situation myself and if my sister had suddenly gone from \u201cwhatever it takes, we need to get them out of there\u201d to \u201cidgaf what you do but I\u2019m out cause I don\u2019t wanna piss my bf off\u201d I\u2019d be pressuring her to reconsider as well. It would change things if Ellie was backing out for her own personal reasons like you and a lot of others are assuming but nothing like that is mentioned, everything Ellie has said (according to this post) adds up to \u201cmy bf said no\u201d. Then you add those texts into that equation? Really sounds like the bf is trying to control her and isolate her from her family altogether.\n\nI\u2019m not saying that\u2019s the fact of the situation, as you said you really can\u2019t be certain with these posts as they only provide the perspective of one party, but according to what I\u2019m reading that seems to be the case.", "Again, OP hasn't said that her sister said that *she herself* didn't want to adopt her siblings, she said her boyfriend didn't want her to. Is that ok? To me? No. \n\nTelling the truth of the situation isn't guilt tripping. Her sister isn't forcing her, she asked her to rethink her choice - which is fair - it's a big decision to make that will impact nine lives.", "One is blinded by concern, the other by love, and both are struggling with trauma. One is deeply concerned about her siblings\u2019 safety and well-being while the other doesn\u2019t want to lose what is probably the first time she\u2019s felt loved by someone other than her siblings. I\u2019d be willing to bet OP has always been the more aggressively protective type while Ellie is more passive and sensitive (and I say that with no negative connotations whatsoever). To say OP is perpetrating abuse is a reach unless other information comes to light.\n\nAlso - and this is 100% speculation - but OP is likely just as concerned with Ellie\u2019s situation as she is with her other siblings\u2019. I think if Ellie had a reason other than \u201cmy bf said\u201d that OP would probably not be pressuring her as much to reconsider.", "There\u2019s other NTA/NAH comments that have worded it a lot better than I am. I\u2019m honestly shocked at how many harsh YTA comments there are.", "You are N T A for wanting to look out for your younger siblings. But that is your choice and you shouldn't force it on your sister. YTA for trying to guilt her into doing what you want. Neither you nor her should be made to feel obligated to raise or save your siblings from your parents.", "YTA.  Leave your sister alone with this.  Neither of you had a childhood since your parents forced you into a sub parent role in the household.  Now you're wanting her to give up her young adulthood too in order to continue in that role.  That's a big ask.  I know you want to get your siblings away from your parents and the trauma that you went through but this is not on you or your sister.  If you decide to go forward you need to make sure you're prepared to leave her out of it.", "YTA. Your plans are your plans, but gave you thought you might want to deprogramming yourself a little you've been trained very well but now you are free", "YTA your doing what your parents did and your trying to make your sister responsible for kids that aren\u2019t her. That\u2019s great that you are willing to do the hard thing but don\u2019t put that on your sister. You and her get to make choices for yourself. Even if her choice is for her boyfriends benefit it\u2019s still her choice. Get off your high horse with your sister.", "YTA. Your cause is noble and your intentions good but you don't have the right to force your sister to become a parent if she doesn't want to. Your sister understandably wants a normal life and neither her nor you have a moral obligation to take in your siblings. \n\nIf you succeed in shaming your sister into becoming an involuntary parent, she will resent you and your siblings and may potentially become emotionally abusive towards them because of it. Unwilling parents don't make the best parents.", "YTA. Yor pushing your sister. Just hope she's not swapping one problem for another. If she's just doing this to make him happy. You and she were trained to give.", "YTA. Your parents suck, let's get that straight. However, you have zero right to force your sister to adopt your siblings just because it's what you want to do. You may be coming from a good place, but you're still overstepping your mark. Your sister is allowed to live her life however she wants. If she changed her mind you have to deal with it; instead of blaming her for your parents being awful.", "I realize you've been programed your whole life to function from a place of guilt and obligation, but it's not feasible for you to raise 8 children, even if sis did want to help. It's a terrible situation, but that doesn't mean you are capable of solving it. If the abuse is so bad that you would realistically have a chance at custody, you need to involve CPS now. If the children are removed from the home, perhaps you could still be a permanent presence in their lives. But don't sacrifice your life for theirs - then everyone loses. And sis's boyfriend may not be so great, or he may be, but she'll figure it out. Your heart is in the right place. But sometimes the problem is too enormous for a young woman to fix", "NAH If you leave her alone. It's very variant of you to want to take on so much and help your siblings. It's perfectly acceptable that your sister doesn't want to. \n\nYou will be the AH if you continue to bug her about it.", "YTA. Your parents forced her into living a way she hated and parenting her siblings; now you are trying to force her to change her life and parent her siblings. Stop! \n\nSINCERELY Apologize, say you won\u2019t ask her to share parenting if you get your siblings. The only thing you have a reason to request is her testimony (if this goes to court) about how your parents treated their children.", "You\u2019re NTA for wanting to help your younger siblings, but she\u2019s NTA either for wanting to live her own life. She didn\u2019t pop out all those kids and it\u2019s not on either of you to take care of them. If you want to get custody of them, that\u2019s your business. If she doesn\u2019t get to criticize your choices, you don\u2019t get to criticize hers.", "NAH. \n\nI think your parent's are awful. I don't get good vibes about your sister's bf too be honest.  Not bc she doesn't want to take on all the kids, buy this seems like his decision...I could be wrong.", "YTA likely the boyfriend pointed out that she is entitled to a life. There is 20 years of parenting ahead for the siblings, she isn't ready to give up her freedom, her money, and her own potential family to raise her parent's kids. There is nothing wrong with this. What you want to do is noble, but you will give up a lot. She doesn't want to do it, leave her be.", "Yta. Only in regards to how you are treating your sister. In every other aspect, you\u2019re wonderful. \nYou just admitted you were both forced to parent these siblings all your life. And ESCAPED. For you the next step is helping the others but for your sister, she wants to live her life for the first time ever and that\u2019s perfectly fine and normal. These are her boundaries. Most people in that situation end up never wanting to be care takers again. She is still dealing with a lot of trauma from this and you want to force her back into it. Help your siblings how you can but don\u2019t force her back into that lifestyle", "Yeah soft YTA, uh obviously neither of you should have to step up to raise your siblings, and it\u2019s great that you\u2019re willing to. But your sister can change her mind *AS LONG AS* it\u2019s *her* decision. Not her bf\u2019s. She had a right to a dating life and just a life that doesn\u2019t revolve around your siblings, but her bf has absolutely no say in whether or not she adopts your siblings. His telling her she can\u2019t is a red flag imo.", "NTA\n\nI completely understand your intent while understanding that she also has the right to grow as her own person.\n\nWhat concerns me is the boyfriends behavior. Under normal circumstances that is a giant red flag. Considering how shelter y'all were it is huge.", "Yeah, by the time the youngest is an adult OP and sister will be about 40. Asking someone to basically start living their own life at 40 is ridiculous, no matter how well intentioned. I can\u2019t fault the bf for not wanting to take on 8 children\u2014I doubt you\u2019d find anyone who would.", "I am getting the same gut feeling about him. The text sounds like an attempt at isolation. Even the sister\u2019s argument sounds shady. It\u2019s not \u201cI want to live my own life\u201d. It\u2019s \u201c I want to make him happy\u201d. I would say ESH (soft one for OP, hard one for the BF) except the sister."]}
