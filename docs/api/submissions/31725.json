From preschool when older children tried to urinate on him in the stalls, to now when children repeatedly get him in trouble and call him really nasty names, including that he's dumb and gay. His best friend turned against him and slammed him against a wall once and started choking him. This friend has since been removed from his life, but they still see each other in class. This friend is deeply troubled and had a troubled childhood so far. I will refer to my stepson as my son from here on out, as he is my son at this point.\n\n\nMy son has ADD and is Dyslexic, diagnosed 2 years ago. Since hitting puberty he's been questioning his sexuality (his bio mom and I are lesbian) and he's hinted at being bisexual. Not that any of this really matters tbh. He knows we love him as whatever he decides to be. Since being diagnosed, the psychologist has been seeing him every month or so for therapy sessions as well. She's taught him how to deal with bullies in general. He made the mistake of telling said best friend (up top) about possibly being bisexual and it spread like wildfire throughout the school. \n\n\nAnyway. The story today... So my son's class organized a secret santa. The name my son pulled was one of his bullies (not the one that slammed him against a wall) that kept calling him \"a gay thing\" and generally being an asshole to him.\n\n\nThis boy asked for a poker set and the budget was 100 (more or less $5) set by the school. My son wanted to buy him a glue stick. His idea was to give the bully 2 presents. A glue stick and the poker set. He asked me to write the letters that go along with both gifts due to his dyslexia.\n\n\nThe glue stick letter reads: \n\nDear (bully) \n\nThis glue stick is so you can glue your mouth shut every time you want to be nasty to someone. It hurt me that you called me a \"gay thing\" repeatedly. I am not gay, and even if i was, which I'm not, I'm still a human being with emotions. I hope you do better in the future. May you have a good holiday with family that loves you.\n\n\nThe Poker set letter reads:\n\n\nHi. It's me again. Here is your actual gift. I hope you win every poker game you play with this set. I wish you the best for high school and the future. May you only receive kindness, happiness and love. Good luck with high school! Merry Christmas and Happy New Year! \n\n\nHe's going to give the glue stick first and then the poker set. The boy isn't going to my son's high school next year. MY mother said he can't do that and he's gonna get beaten up deservedly. She says that kids bully others for a reason usually. We had a big fight over this. She thinks the letter is too direct and an asshole move. \n\n\nAm i and my son an asshole?\n\n\n\nETA: Please note that my son will not see this kid again. My son is finishing primary school in 2 days, when the secret santa will happen. We have normal school years lol. It starts in Jan and ends in Dec with 4 school holidays. The big December holiday is coming up now in 2 days and then my boy will be in high school away from this kid.\n\n\nETA 2: I will be there picking my son up the second he leaves school. His class is right at the entrance. The only interaction he will have with the bully will be in class under teacher supervision. This kid also goes to after school so he stays behind while my son will walk out of the school's property. If anything goes wrong, i will be right there to see it. I will repeat what i said before. My kid will NOT see this boy again. They are going to different high schools. The secret santa takes place on the last day of school when they leave at 9am anyway.

It's really cringe and a bully is going to laugh hysterically and share with all their bully friends.  8th graders are as cruel as they get.  \n\nIf you want petty revenge, go get a fancy box to get the kid's hopes up, like a video game box or set of legos.  Or maybe a box that explodes with glitter if you're bold. That's a proper prank, not some little nerd lecture.  \n\nBut no, no cheesy notes.

You're also not teaching him constructive strategies to deal with this in the future. Adding something polite to the end doesn't alleviate the super aggressive tone of the letter. \n\nIt's also... dumb. The bully doesn't need to learn to keep his mouth shut. He needs to learn compassion and empathy. Just like your kid needs to learn that telling someone to fuck off doesn't feel nearly as good as learning not to give a shit because you're content within yourself. \n\nAnd handing first one and then the other is just adding confrontation on top of confrontation. Just add something in the note with the actual gift about how he hopes the kid gains some empathy if you can't leave well enough alone.

My younger sister was bullied and this sort of response to acts of bullying was also encouraged by our own mother. I can see why it seems appropriate, but the perspective I can offer is, all it succeeded in doing in my sister\u2019s case was get her more bullying that she began to develop a sort of holier-than-thou attitude about. As an adult she will not stand up for herself directly in any situation, she will instead soothe herself after the fact by telling our mom her sad stories and being reassured she is the better person. I guess it works for her but I think she could have a nicer life if she had learned a different approach.", "Teach your son about consequences.

Letting him know that he has been hurt by this kid, but also not depriving him of the gift. \n\nBut please, make him at least ready for some kind of response. It may not have an impact, but your son will be doing it his way.

As someone who has always stood up to bullies and accepted the consequences, I say do it. Especially with only 2 days left in school and the administration isn't going to do shit for a letter if they didn't for urinating on a child or choking one out. Bullies only understand one thing. And that's standing up to them or humiliating them in public. They don't like to be the center of the ridicule, just the ones engineering it. Personally, I wouldn't have even given him the poker set. I would have given him the glue and letter and walked away. I did much better with bullies than the kids who kept quiet and tried to do the right thing.

If your son wasn\u2019t dyslexic he would have written that himself. So I\u2019d say, it\u2019s not so much about who wrote it.

Talk to the teacher and principal of the school (understanding that schools aren\u2019t all the same in different countries)\n2. Let your son know he can stand up for himself (ex. letter)\n3.

We encouraged ours to fight back, and let him know we\u2019ll deal with the adults. \n\nI\u2019m guessing you\u2019ve already done all this. \n\nBut push back can also mean that kids will mock his letter. The intention is great. \n\nIDEA: Is there a way for you to not include the letter. When the kids open the presents, they will likely say \u201ca glue stick\u201d.

The kids bullied him and mocked him the whole night. He wouldn't even talk to us. He just sat in the car and cried for literal hours until we finally dragged it out of him. He isn't social. He isn't active. He isn't interested in sports. He will probably not go to another dance any time soon, and the next big event will be his matric farewell in 5 years. He also doesn't want to date as he finds kissing anyone gross. Our kids don't hang out with kids we don't know. They don't go to any friends houses unless we know the parents and kids. Usually their friends visit at our home so we can keep an eye out for any bullying activity, especially my son. They also hang out at houses, not malls and other public spaces. 4 kids have gone missing this year from my daughter's school. It's dangerous and not feasible in my country.", "You're right. I'll have a talk with him tomorrow. Maybe we can think of something else here. Thanks for the comment!", "My son hates being called gay. I understand the bullied kid getting in trouble. There was a situation a couple weeks ago where someone threw him with a pen. He picked it up and asked who's pen it was and a girl in his class said in a very condescending tone \"Ask your mom's girlfriend!\" He snapped the pen into pieces and told her to NEVER speak about his family like that again. The girl was shocked and apologized. The teacher only caught half of it and punished my son for destroying property. He just simply has reached his breaking point. His sister is 2 years older than him and she's already in high school. He's joining her when school's reopen in January.
