When we first started dating she used to joke that my place looked like corporate housing but I just like more industrial style interiors.  I think it looks nice.  My gf's place always looked like she got her furniture off the side of the road, none of it matched, the colors were loud, etc.\n\nSince moving in together we have had to compromise on a lot around the house, like she wanted to buy painted dishes (they were blue with big ugly red/orange flowers just splattered on them) and we compromised on a nice white set with small flower trim, or the new couch she wanted a purple and orange one but we got a nice brown leather one instead since it will match more.  There are more examples of her picking out garish stuff but you get the idea.\n\nShe asked about 3 weeks ago if she could decorate her office/our spare bedroom since I never go in there and she does work outta there/spend a lot of time in there.  I thought she meant buy a few knickknacks or maybe a new comforter/lamp something.  Today when I got home I discovered she went to her storage unit and dragged half her bedroom back to our place.  There are paisley curtains and iron outdoor tables and weird lamps and none of it matches, it looks like a drunk hippie thru up a garage sale.  I told her this was not what I had in mind and more importantly our guests will have to sleep in there.  What would they think? That we ran out of money and went nuts at a flea market?  I asked her to tone it down and maybe make it more monochromatic like the rest of the house.  I said this gently and even suggested that we could online and find things we BOTH like together but shes upset with me and has barely spoken to me since I got home, aita?", "created_utc": 1674272986, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10hhwi8/aita_for_insisting_my_gf_redecorate_her_officeour/", "score": 5901, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

When we first started dating she used to joke that my place looked like corporate housing but I just like more industrial style interiors.  I think it looks nice.  My gf's place always looked like she got her furniture off the side of the road, none of it matched, the colors were loud, etc.\n\nSince moving in together we have had to compromise on a lot around the house, like she wanted to buy painted dishes (they were blue with big ugly red/orange flowers just splattered on them) and we compromised on a nice white set with small flower trim, or the new couch she wanted a purple and orange one but we got a nice brown leather one instead since it will match more.  There are more examples of her picking out garish stuff but you get the idea.\n\nShe asked about 3 weeks ago if she could decorate her office/our spare bedroom since I never go in there and she does work outta there/spend a lot of time in there.  I thought she meant buy a few knickknacks or maybe a new comforter/lamp something.  Today when I got home I discovered she went to her storage unit and dragged half her bedroom back to our place.  There are paisley curtains and iron outdoor tables and weird lamps and none of it matches, it looks like a drunk hippie thru up a garage sale.  I told her this was not what I had in mind and more importantly our guests will have to sleep in there.  What would they think? That we ran out of money and went nuts at a flea market?  I asked her to tone it down and maybe make it more monochromatic like the rest of the house.  I said this gently and even suggested that we could online and find things we BOTH like together but shes upset with me and has barely spoken to me since I got home, aita?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

You\u2019re not even letting her have a say in her own home. What\u2019s so terrible about her trying to express herself? And then, when she tries to compromise by at least getting to decorate one small room you hate it because you\u2019re more worried about what your imaginary guests will think than your significant other. Have you looked up the definition of significant? In case you haven\u2019t it means important- like, someone you\u2019re supposed to value. Have you ever thought that maybe if you hadn\u2019t been such a dictator with the rest of the house she wouldn\u2019t have had to \u201cgo overboard\u201d on the one room in the house you condescended to let her decorate? I doubt her style is even bad and it\u2019s more likely that you can\u2019t understand anything that isn\u2019t completely utilitarian. Heaven forbid she bring color or life or fun into her home. I don\u2019t usually say this but you need to step up or she\u2019s gonna leave you since you\u2019re literally isolating off a piece of her identity simply because you can\u2019t be bothered to find out what she likes and why.", "Haha I just don't see how you were gentle with your comments\ud83d\ude02", "Ugh.

Our ceilings are tall and rooms are big. It feels very clean and industrial. We then warmed it up with wood pieces (like valances, custom coffee tables) and kept the furniture neutral but did pops of BRIGHT color with rugs, accent chairs and a few, small accent cutouts on the wall painted a bold color. Lastly, we have some wall hangings that are personalized, like a handwritten page my kid wrote blown up to poster size and framed above the piano or a personal landscape photo of a gorgeous place we visited printed on a large canvas and hung up.

Somebody you've heard of, and somebody who carries some kind of warranty outside of the 12 month \"default in construction\" guarantee that's standard, because that shows you they will stand behind their product and you aren't limited to seeking solutions with only the store should anything go haywire. \n\nPrice is a good indicator of quality, yes, and usually the first step I reccomend looking at when narrowing down choices. A good rule of thumb is that a decent leather recliner or accent chair shouldn't be any less than 1k. Multiply that by every seat on the piece your looking at. (sofa is 3 seats, 3k. Loveseat is two seats, 2k. A sectional with six seats, 6k. Etc)\n\nAfter that, rely on your sales person. They should know what kind of leather it's made of. Ask specifically what type of leather grain is used. If they don't know, they should be able to find out. If they play dumb, ask for a printout of the construction details from the manufacturer's website. If they don't know and can't or aren't willing to find out for you, choose a different store, because that's a sign their staff isn't properly trained OR they're trained to answer vaguely, both of which are indicators of the stores possible poor integrity.\n\nEdited to add: Also, be aware that there are some brands (Ashley is one that does this, as well as some Flexsteel models) that will use a combination of materials to keep costs and prices down. They'll use top grain leather in the seat, armrests, back cushion and headrest (basically anywhere your body touches when using it) and then use a matching, cheaper material like vinyl to upholstery the sides and back panels. This is a pretty good compromise, as the movement and oils of your body is what causes cracking, peeling, and fading of color on those cheaper materials, but it hurts nothing to have vinyl in the back panels facing the wall. Again, if your salesperson can't give you these details, best to shop elsewhere.", "Opposites attract when you *like* how the other person is different from you.
