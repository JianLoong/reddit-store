When we first started dating she used to joke that my place looked like corporate housing but I just like more industrial style interiors.  I think it looks nice.  My gf's place always looked like she got her furniture off the side of the road, none of it matched, the colors were loud, etc.\n\nSince moving in together we have had to compromise on a lot around the house, like she wanted to buy painted dishes (they were blue with big ugly red/orange flowers just splattered on them) and we compromised on a nice white set with small flower trim, or the new couch she wanted a purple and orange one but we got a nice brown leather one instead since it will match more.  There are more examples of her picking out garish stuff but you get the idea.\n\nShe asked about 3 weeks ago if she could decorate her office/our spare bedroom since I never go in there and she does work outta there/spend a lot of time in there.  I thought she meant buy a few knickknacks or maybe a new comforter/lamp something.  Today when I got home I discovered she went to her storage unit and dragged half her bedroom back to our place.  There are paisley curtains and iron outdoor tables and weird lamps and none of it matches, it looks like a drunk hippie thru up a garage sale.  I told her this was not what I had in mind and more importantly our guests will have to sleep in there.  What would they think? That we ran out of money and went nuts at a flea market?  I asked her to tone it down and maybe make it more monochromatic like the rest of the house.  I said this gently and even suggested that we could online and find things we BOTH like together but shes upset with me and has barely spoken to me since I got home, aita?", "created_utc": 1674272986, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10hhwi8/aita_for_insisting_my_gf_redecorate_her_officeour/", "score": 787, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

When we first started dating she used to joke that my place looked like corporate housing but I just like more industrial style interiors.  I think it looks nice.  My gf's place always looked like she got her furniture off the side of the road, none of it matched, the colors were loud, etc.\n\nSince moving in together we have had to compromise on a lot around the house, like she wanted to buy painted dishes (they were blue with big ugly red/orange flowers just splattered on them) and we compromised on a nice white set with small flower trim, or the new couch she wanted a purple and orange one but we got a nice brown leather one instead since it will match more.  There are more examples of her picking out garish stuff but you get the idea.\n\nShe asked about 3 weeks ago if she could decorate her office/our spare bedroom since I never go in there and she does work outta there/spend a lot of time in there.  I thought she meant buy a few knickknacks or maybe a new comforter/lamp something.  Today when I got home I discovered she went to her storage unit and dragged half her bedroom back to our place.  There are paisley curtains and iron outdoor tables and weird lamps and none of it matches, it looks like a drunk hippie thru up a garage sale.  I told her this was not what I had in mind and more importantly our guests will have to sleep in there.  What would they think? That we ran out of money and went nuts at a flea market?  I asked her to tone it down and maybe make it more monochromatic like the rest of the house.  I said this gently and even suggested that we could online and find things we BOTH like together but shes upset with me and has barely spoken to me since I got home, aita?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Have you looked up the definition of significant? In case you haven\u2019t it means important- like, someone you\u2019re supposed to value. Have you ever thought that maybe if you hadn\u2019t been such a dictator with the rest of the house she wouldn\u2019t have had to \u201cgo overboard\u201d on the one room in the house you condescended to let her decorate? I doubt her style is even bad and it\u2019s more likely that you can\u2019t understand anything that isn\u2019t completely utilitarian. Heaven forbid she bring color or life or fun into her home. I don\u2019t usually say this but you need to step up or she\u2019s gonna leave you since you\u2019re literally isolating off a piece of her identity simply because you can\u2019t be bothered to find out what she likes and why.", "Haha I just don't see how you were gentle with your comments\ud83d\ude02", "Ugh.

I have to begrudgingly admit it looks nice. \n\n A compromise in this case  would have been \u201clet\u2019s get this boring black sofa, but you get some throw pillows and blankets to add color\u201d. OP is not doing that. He\u2019s TA for so much more than what\u2019s in the title.", "It makes me wonder about their sartorial disparities too. I can't imagine how these people dress if her interior decorating was such a shock.", "Not a suggestion, more of a warning.", "Hate to think what he thinks and says about her body", "Well if op got his way they would think \"Fuck me, I'm sleeping in a doctor's waiting room\"", "The worst part is she had to ask permission to redecorate her own office. If it were me and my bf it\u2019d go like this, \u201chey love I\u2019m thinking of redecorating my office\u201d, \u201coh that sounds lovely,\u201d. And either of us could be on either end of that conversation.", "Lol this reference is amazing.", "Yes! She is totally a Penelope!!! XD", "Nah not so much the decorating. More the personality. You know the bland stiff suits man meets the quirky free colourful spirit.", "Seeing as he described the look of the house as monochromatic, I'm pretty sure they don't have purple and orange cushions.", "My partner and I recently went couch shopping. I wanted something comfortable but that wouldn\u2019t be difficult for me to get up from (I\u2019m quite short and have disabilities), my partner wanted something that reclined. Funny enough he (and our son) fell in love with a black leather reclining couch \ud83d\ude02 we took some time to discuss it, and the compromise was that he got his couch, but I got to order slipcovers of my choice because sitting on leather is awful. I wear shorts a lot and don\u2019t like feeling like my skin is being ripped off when I stand up XD so we have a black sofa and teal slipcovers! \n\nOP ^^^ that\u2019s what compromise looks like. Both people walk away happy, not both people walk away unhappy", "Im so glad my husband and I totally agreed on a red cover for our IKEA couch once and currently have a darker blue one now. We pick out fun pillow covers for the seasons and like pops of color. Most of our appliances are red and teal. I couldn\u2019t imagine being married to someone so controlling and not fun. We have nice neutral furniture and have fun with accessories and small stuff.", "God, I hate leather sofas. Your tights stick on it as soon as it gets hot And you\u2019re wearing skirts or shorts.", "I can hear the sound of getting up off a leather sofa. Fell asleep drunk on one once in summer clothing, 0/10 would not recommend waking up that way.", "I used to think the same until we brought a real, high quality leather couch and I swear to God it is the softest and most comfortable thing in the world. \n\nYou shouldn't be laying on a couch and letting the couch soak up your sweat, it's just going to make it stink and discolour. Most people don't clean their couches as often as they should and leather is the easiest to clean. It doesn't stain and it always looks good.\n\nI'll never go back to another fabric couch again.", "I do.  Bought a really comfortable Stressless one from Ekornes.  Well made, comfortable, but not so soft that it\u2019s hard to get off of.  Plus I worry a lot less over spills than with a fabric couch.", "I love my leather sofa!", "I do. I have a decently nice hand me down one from a friend. It's incredibly comfortable and not that faux leather squishy type but a nice semi firm couch. I have two couches in my living room though so guests don't have to sit on it if they prefer a softer fabric covered couch. The contrast between the darker brown to my lighter colored couch is nice too. It gives off a comfortable homey vibe.", "I think he's TA and I think leather is the only acceptable sofa option and dream of affording it again.\n\nBut it has to be good leather. Cheap is not okay, might as well get the plastic grandma covers. Soft, buttery leather feels amazing on skin and lasts for decades.\n\nAnd you don't have to vacuum it every single day because stuff doesn't attach to it like every other sofa I have had. I swear, some are actually made of Velcro.", "You'd be surprised at how well the colours can go together on something like a sofa if it's been well thought out and made.\n\nMy sister has an 'odd' sense of style.. much like OPs gf does.  It doesn't suit me at all and my style doesn't suit her at all, but both of our places have got compliments from the other.\n\nI have to admit to shaking my head when i see her latest decoration choices,  but meh.. it does actually look good -  it's different and very much uniquely her.", "Not only is she second to HIM in her own home, she's second to potential guests and their potential judgement. How low can you get on the list of priorities before you bail...?", "He's completely missing how in and popular boho maximalism is as well", "It's a good conversation starter if anything", "This was my EX husband.  He changed drastically *after*  the \"I do's\".", "I legitimately don't think they can stay together if their taste in even the most basic of things is so radically different. What else are they worlds apart on I wonder?\n\nLike I'm more like OP. I don't like all kinds of colors in my house. It's a very toned down palate. \n\nI have to wonder just how else are OP and his GF different? This is probably just the tip of the iceberg.", "I mean, tbf, we all like what we're used to.\nI for one can't blame an AH for liking brown.", "Honestly I love industrial furniture and metal and wood but I also like to add texture and color. Right now only my office is more industrial and the rest of the house is more idk farmhouse/cottage but not like hardcore. We like cozy furniture and fun pillows. This guy sounds like he\u2019s trying to sound bougie and impress someone\u2026not sure who\u2019s give a crap tho.", "I'm barking orders through a medium:\n\n\"OP's girlfriend, I hope you can hear me. Dump him! What? No I'm not a ghost, this is the voice of reason.\"", "Maybe that's what he wants.", "That purple and Orange couch is dope.", "My boyfriend and I will not be having kids. Should we be lucky enough to have two spare rooms, them being his and her rooms would definitely be an option. The other option would be one office and one hobby room for his Legos and my crafts.\n\nOur tastes don't clash in the way OPs does and our house will definitely be our house. But a room of one's own... sounds pretty nice right?", "Right? My bf doesn't really care about home decor and lets me do the majority of it, but he does have certain things he dislikes--mainly my penchant for wanting things to be pink (my favorite color). We're currently in a house big enough that we each have our own office and the only time I feel the need to even mention to him when I add pink to my office is if I'm really excited about it and want to see him roll his eyes at it \ud83e\udd23", "Excuse you, it was elephant grey!", "I dunno I see a frighteningly large amount of couches that are uncomfortable", "I've noticed there are generally two male interior style \n\n*Male Industrial Shop* that looks like a tidy garage workshop (wrought iron, beaten woodtops, industrial lighting) or the \n\n*Modern Contemporary* that looks like a car interior (red, black, leather, chrome and glass)", "I live in Australia, leather sofas are not anyone's friend!", "Falling asleep/sitting on a leather sofa in the summertime is a new level of Purgatory. 0/10 Would not recommend!", "I too have fallen asleep on a leather couch, never again.", "lol right!!? \notherwise he\u2019d be all for the style\u2026 then he\u2019ll look cool for his guests", "Nicely done", "I honestly really wouldn't like that in my home, I have more of a copy,wooden, rustic vibe but it my fianc\u00e8 wanted it we would compromise more than going for the most uncomfortable leather looking one we could find ( not that it is my style either)", "And it even comes in his boring color scheme! So you'd think if he were truly looking to compromise they would have done that\n\n[couch](https://www.modani.com/living/sofas/maili-sectional-sofa-gray)", "I really want one now!", "Not if he was referring the cast couch videos lol", "Sleeping in the winter on one isn't nice either. My mil has one in the living room (one of the coldest rooms in the house besides the bathroom) and it's horrible. It only gets warm where you sit, if you move, then rip, you missed your warm spot and can't get back because it got cold. \n\nThey do put a bed topper on it whenever someone wants to sleep on the couch, and it helps a little, but then it feels like you're slipping away\n\nLeather couches suck"]}
