When we first started dating she used to joke that my place looked like corporate housing but I just like more industrial style interiors.  I think it looks nice.  My gf's place always looked like she got her furniture off the side of the road, none of it matched, the colors were loud, etc.\n\nSince moving in together we have had to compromise on a lot around the house, like she wanted to buy painted dishes (they were blue with big ugly red/orange flowers just splattered on them) and we compromised on a nice white set with small flower trim, or the new couch she wanted a purple and orange one but we got a nice brown leather one instead since it will match more.  There are more examples of her picking out garish stuff but you get the idea.\n\nShe asked about 3 weeks ago if she could decorate her office/our spare bedroom since I never go in there and she does work outta there/spend a lot of time in there.  I thought she meant buy a few knickknacks or maybe a new comforter/lamp something.  Today when I got home I discovered she went to her storage unit and dragged half her bedroom back to our place.  There are paisley curtains and iron outdoor tables and weird lamps and none of it matches, it looks like a drunk hippie thru up a garage sale.  I told her this was not what I had in mind and more importantly our guests will have to sleep in there.  What would they think? That we ran out of money and went nuts at a flea market?  I asked her to tone it down and maybe make it more monochromatic like the rest of the house.  I said this gently and even suggested that we could online and find things we BOTH like together but shes upset with me and has barely spoken to me since I got home, aita?", "created_utc": 1674272986, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10hhwi8/aita_for_insisting_my_gf_redecorate_her_officeour/", "score": 227, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

When we first started dating she used to joke that my place looked like corporate housing but I just like more industrial style interiors.  I think it looks nice.  My gf's place always looked like she got her furniture off the side of the road, none of it matched, the colors were loud, etc.\n\nSince moving in together we have had to compromise on a lot around the house, like she wanted to buy painted dishes (they were blue with big ugly red/orange flowers just splattered on them) and we compromised on a nice white set with small flower trim, or the new couch she wanted a purple and orange one but we got a nice brown leather one instead since it will match more.  There are more examples of her picking out garish stuff but you get the idea.\n\nShe asked about 3 weeks ago if she could decorate her office/our spare bedroom since I never go in there and she does work outta there/spend a lot of time in there.  I thought she meant buy a few knickknacks or maybe a new comforter/lamp something.  Today when I got home I discovered she went to her storage unit and dragged half her bedroom back to our place.  There are paisley curtains and iron outdoor tables and weird lamps and none of it matches, it looks like a drunk hippie thru up a garage sale.  I told her this was not what I had in mind and more importantly our guests will have to sleep in there.  What would they think? That we ran out of money and went nuts at a flea market?  I asked her to tone it down and maybe make it more monochromatic like the rest of the house.  I said this gently and even suggested that we could online and find things we BOTH like together but shes upset with me and has barely spoken to me since I got home, aita?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

It\u2019s not a waiting room", "i thought this too!!! how sad for her to walk into her home and not feel she fits there :(", "My couch is grey, but just about everything else I own is colourful because I'm renting and otherwise I would be lost in all the shades of white/beige. Would it kill a landlord to occasionally play with a soft blue as an accent? There are more renters than rentals in my area, it wouldn't hurt their bottom line.", ">You're the male version of Live Laugh Love.\n\nThis is a top insult. \n\nOP's gf sounds eclectic and interesting, if she wants a roommate when she leaves OP then I'm available!", "Here's my poor man's award. Not genuine. But I love the colors. \ud83c\udf4d\ud83c\udf4d", "This though. \ud83d\udd1d", "This though. \u2934\ufe0f", "Sounds like he cares more about maintaining and appearance he wants to uphold than he cares about the relationship.", "And why would the guests care?", ">At least you\u2019re showing your true colors.\n\nYes. And they're really boring!", "She works exclusively from home full time.   We do have guests around once every two months as we live near a tourist-y spot and our family/friends will crash here instead of a motel, so while they are not here ALL the time, it is pretty often.", "You gotta be lying\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\n\nThat orange couch is probably the ugliest thing I\u2019ve seen all day\ud83d\udc80", "Really my couches were tacky but you're not going to comment on that purple and orange eyesore?  Unbelievable.", "Eh, it'd look great in the land of beige that is his life.", "I actually gasped when I saw the purple couch because I love it so much. \n\nHis choice at least looked like an art piece. \n\nThe compromise couch looks like something you picked up at CostCo because you needed a couch real quick.", "I produced porn back in Europe and errr the grey couch is definitely used in some studios LMAO actually the brown couch too looks like something I\u2019d spect from a porn set. Leather is easier to clean in those situations.", "yeah if it\u2019s clean and relatively comfortable, I couldn\u2019t care less as a guest", "As a guest I\u2019d love to be in a house with bright colors and poppy design choices ! It makes it more fun and welcoming", "Ahahha love this. OP sounds horribly boring. \ud83d\udca4  Not to mention his hideous choice of decor, or lack thereof. Here's to hoping OP's gf leaves them because she deserves wayyyy better.", "but you know who is in that room ALL the time? your WIFE. the rest of the house is decorated in your tastes, you told her you were giving her one room in the whole house that you both share and now youre taking that back on your word and taking the one room in the house thats is her style because you dont like it. YTA 100%", "Info: why are all your guest such assholes that they will judge you for have one room in your place that doesn\u2019t look a Stalin-era industrial town? \n\nOr are you just projecting your assholeness on them?", "So she spends 320 hours (40 hr work week over 8 weeks) in that room for every guest visit. Family/friends who will probably be awake in the room for less than an hour AND are getting free lodging have more valuable interior design opinions (assuming they agree with you) to you? \n\nThis is why your concern doesn\u2019t make sense. Let her enjoy her work environment. Don\u2019t dampen her creative energy everywhere - she\u2019s already compromised in common areas! Does she get a say in your workspace? Likely Not! \n\nEdit: Just saw the sofa examples in another comment. Sounds like she wants a tastefully done, quirky BnB whereas you are all about the bland Holiday Inn. I vote in her favor so I can wake up each morning with a smile on my face!", "Dude. Come on. You don't get to cohabitate with someone and control the decor completely. You talk of compromises, but I'm not seeing any", "She's in that room far much more than any guests. Tell the choosing beggars they can get a free room & zip it or rent a room more to their liking. Either way, stop judging her & being an AH because her taste differs from yours. \n\nThe audacity here is yikes!", "Your option and the cozy version of your option are pretty soulless honestly. They're boring. The purple and orange looks so freaking fun and funky!", "It seems like you just give her a slightly more comfortable version of what you want. Does she even get to pick anything colorful?", "You seem to want to live in a waiting room.", "The purple and orange eyesore would be fun to live with IN A SPACE DECORATED TO WORK WITH IT.  It would be really interesting. \n\nBut boy, I can't guess what a guy who likes those other two couches sees in the woman who would buy the one you think is an eyesore. I know if I entered your apartment I'd be making my excuses with fifteen minutes! The banality and lack of imagination know no end.", "She picked a really lovely, fun couch for a space that\u2019s lived in. You picked what I\u2019d expect to see at an upscale therapist\u2019s office.", "You've never flipped through a Pier 1 catalog, have you?\n\nMy personal taste is much closer to yours than hers. I love a lot of the modern trends, and an achromatic palette is my comfort zone. I enjoy monochromatic styling as well. \n\nI would *never* buy that orange and purple couch for myself. Still, it is *much* more stylish than what you wanted. When it comes to that kind of look, your girlfriend has a good eye.\n\nYours reminds me of an 80's movie trying to look futuristic.", "The purple and orange\nCouch is beautiful!", "Yea; if I had to pick one of the three, it would be the one your gf picked. It has life and character. Yours looks like something at a clinic or doctors office - boring and not very comfortable/homey. The compromise couch looks alot like one my ex insisted on; it sucked and leather is uncomfortable when you're hot as skin sticks to it. \n\nOP, you aren't compromising as much as you think you are. It sounds like you and your gf aren't compatible. If you keep trying to stifle her, she is eventually going to dump you. I get it; I'm not into overly flamboyant, but I do like character and life in my house. It seems like you are more concerned with presenting an image to the outside world when what you really need to be focusing on what is going on at home. \n\nEdited to add: YTA.", "Ya basic and boring. Her choice was fun and full of personality. Yours was plain and boring which clearly fits your personality to a T.", "So, I grew up in a very, very rich area in my country. I promise you that no-one would think that the couch you want/the one you got looks stylish. I don't particularly like the orange one, but I could actually much easier see that style being used. If the rest of the room is more minimalistic a sort of \"centerpiece\" that is a little over the top looks really amazing. A lot if people here have one specific couch, \"Poeten\" (The Poet) which is often in a fun colour. It costs around 13K USD, some variants of it cost more. Don't feel so superior to your gf because you are not. If you are trying to impress with your sense of style you should get one first. A sense of style that is. Cold-looking homes in grey/white/beige are the style of the nouveau riche, not the style of old money. Stop being pretentious.", "You have absolutely no taste - the lounge you chose is boring & tacky", "Your couches look like they belong in an investment firm. Her couch looks comfortable and soft and friendly. And the brown couch? Not even close to a compromise. YTA", "Yup.  Hers has style and character.  Yours are soulless and lacking any identifiable style.", "That\u2019s a cool boho style couch I\u2019d love to sit on that orange purple one! It\u2019s beautiful. The grey one looks cheap and very uncomfortable and uninviting like stuff you would see at an old folks home\nThat is very easy to wipe or a hospital. The purple on is like a nice conversation starter. Though a brown one seems nice why not let her throw some cool throw pillows on it? \n\nAnd her office her space. She might work better in a more comfortable environment! \n\nIt takes time but my husband and I are blending our styles and I tend to lean more boho and industrial and he leans more old American so we compromise and buy things that lean both or I add poufs or rugs in my style to blend it.", "yours looks so depressing", "You seem like a very boring and dull person. Your taste isn't good just because you hate colors and like boring monochrome shit. YTA.", "I literally made a sound of disgust when I saw your couch. Why do you want your home to look like a workplace?\n\nSure hers wasn\u2019t the prettiest thing ever, but it looked comfy at least!", "Your ideal couch choice is ugly, mainly in form then in color. The compromise seemed like a bunch of brown couches, so.. looks like yours, potentially with various form but brown. A neutral color. Not a compromise if you stay within your bland color scheme. This is the fight you're choosing? It means so much to you to be happier than your gf? Doesn't sound like you \"love\" her all that much. Still, YTA. (Also loved the vibrantness of her couch, it had colors that go well together with a nice pattern and form and gave you something to look at instead of your, again, very ugly in form, bland in color - ideal - choice. Id spend more time looking away from your choice and hers id sit and stare admiring the complimenting colors and patterns. To most of us here, seems like we think she has a better eye.)", "Colours aside, the \"eyesore\" your GF picked looks like something I would expect to see in a Moroccan-Berber living room; I actually have something similar in my house in Morocco.\n\nLots of people love this style, and it could have been an opportunity for you to find a colour scheme that works for you two, and maybe even learn about different styles and countries. I personally wouldn't like to live in an aseptic space devoid of any personality on account of it looking depressing and sad, but it seems to be your thing. Leave your GF out of it, though.", "The couch she likes looks so comfy. I\u2019d buy that", "I admit the purple and orange sofa is a bit much, but the other two couches are just terrible. Ewwww.", "That couch isn't an eyesore, it's gorgeous! You just have dull taste.", "It's a beautiful couch?", "I honestly love it. Boho is on trend, I play the Sims and that it's literally the aesthetic I go for all the time since I don't have the economy to do that at my own place lmao", "She is a neon butterfly, and you are a worm. Seriously, what would it possibly hurt to have actual color in your home? I feel horrible for her. She probably feels suffocated living in your monochromatic hell.", "That purple and orange one looks awesome. Comfortable, cultural, stylish, fun, and unique.\n\nThe gray leather one looks like a spaceship or something a 14 year old boy who likes to play video games would want in his room.\n\nThe brown leather one looks like something in my grandparents house. Double points if part/all of it reclines.\n\nUnbelievable.", "Her couch was absolutely stylish & lovely! Yours on the other hand are boring & look like they belong in the basement (aka man cave.)", "There are not enough throws and cushions anywhere to make the compromise couch look homely.", "*gf \ud83d\ude0f", "I don't understand why anyone would pick a lounge that isn't squishy and comfortable as the first priority. Lounges and mattresses are the 2 household items worth buying for comfort first.\n\nAs someone with eclectic taste but without the bravery of OP's girlfriend to commit to large colourful furniture, I went with mid-grey fabric squishy lounge and put a mix of colourful embroidered cushions and throws on it.", "I actually love GF's pick and would absolutely buy it.", "Fun fact, it's almost *identical* to the couch at my son's former not-upscale therapist's office!", "This! Her pick is not my style but it has style. He picked the most stuffy, suburban, run of the mill stuff imaginable. Positively ghastly.", "It looks like it belongs in a Doctor\u2019s waiting  room - a poor doctors", "**Probably ex gf soon with OPs attitude ...", "Right? Op\u2019s girlfriend can come live with me anytime, that\u2019s like the coolest couch I've ever seen", "That couch is awesome! I wonder if he can put up a link for the dishes too?", "It's now on my wish list \ud83d\ude02 (in my head bc I'm broke)", "It could fit so many different styles! His choice is so boring & cookie cutter. I love her choice so much because it looks fun & comfy!", "My doctor definitely has couches that look almost identical to the brown one in his office as well.", "I thought \"how BORING.\" We have a leather sofa and it's actually got style. These look like the sofas in my therapist's waiting room.", "If she needs a future roomie she can totally decorate my flat. \ud83d\ude0f"]}
