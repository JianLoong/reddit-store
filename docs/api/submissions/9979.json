We moved in together 6 months ago for a 6 month lease to test the waters of living together. The relationship is obviously over now but I want to gauge if I had the right thinking because if this is what dating is like now, I might just skip out on it. \n\nOur major issue that honestly is the reason I went ahead and ended things is that she wanted to split bills 60/40 because I made more money. \n\nI make about 120k and she makes 40k. I didnt think it was fair for me to pay more because I worked harder and had a better job, when she could just get a better job instead of making me foot the bill because I was dating her. It felt honestly like a scam, like she wanted me to pay for the \"privilege\" of being able to sleep with her and use me like a piggy bank. \n\nShe wanted to move into the cheapest place we could find in the area, a studio apartment in the ghetto with an obvious roach problem for $1600. 2 adults and 2 dogs cant live in a studio apartment without going insane, at that point she was just being cheap and ridiculous. We went for the better option where rent is $1900 because I was trying to stay in her budget, please keep in mind I left my $2600 apartment for this woman. \n\nWe moved and she kept bringing up that we need to change the bill split because it wasn't fair. 50/50 is fair in every sense of the word. \n\nShe said it would max out her budget and drain her savings because she can't save money. I said it sounded like a personal problem and she should get a better job, or come work at my company where we're hiring. But she didn't want to. she went to stay with her friend which shocked me she would do all of that over a small issue.\n\nSo I went ahead and ended it, because she was giving me the silent treatment and not answering calls at that point. When she came back to get her stuff she had her dad and brothers with her and they were giving me dirty looks. I tried to say goodbye to her and at least not leave things off that harshly and she just told me to fuck off.\n\nNow some of our mutual friends are saying that I'm selfish but I don't see how. Its 2023, equal rights and what not, so how is 50/50 not fair just because I make more money? I'd like some input and real answers. I found the cheapest option for living and lowered my personal living standard for her as it was.

Honestly cringed reading your post and am so glad that girl got out. Your post comes across as self-centered. You wanted her to float half the bill for you to keep your own standard of living when she makes a fraction of what you do. You were having someone financially struggling subsidize your standard of living. \n\n50/50 is even; it isn\u2019t fair. \n\nAgain, YTA.", "YTA. You can agree upon a 50/50 split of expenses, but then you need to be willing to live within her budget. Instead, you whined about your $2600 apartment when she probably doesn't take home $2600 a month.", "YTA.  It's not about equal rights.  It's about common sense.  The gender is irrelevant.\n\nYou make 3x what she did.  And she was only asking you to pay a little bit extra.\n\n> so how is 50/50 not fair just because I make more money?\n\nBecause you make 3x what she does.  It's not about gender;  it's just about the reality.", "If she made three times the money you do, would you still be demanding a 50/50 split in expenses? \n\nIs that a no I hear? Are you saying that wouldn't be fair? \n\nOf course you are. YTA.", "YTA. You were prepared to do everything to accomodate her, except for of course compromising in any way, shape or form.\n\nYour income is three times hers - so of course she is shopping in a vastly different budget to you. You weren\u2019t prepared to split bills with even a tiny bit of bias, so of course she has to shop at the cheap end of the market. $950 per month is a lot to spend on rent when you only make $40k per year.\n\nYour comment about \u201cwork harder\u201d is pretty slimy, too. What do you both do for work, and how old are you both?", "YTA, \n\nHow you call her \u201ethis woman\u201d just sais it all.  I don\u2019t know any men that would insist of splitting everything evenly with their partners and consider it being fair. Relationships are about sharing what you have with the person you share your life with. If you just want someone to split the rent with, get a roommate.", "YTA. Some of your comments are so condescending.", "YTA - 50/50 is not fair it is equal. 1 hour of your time is equivalent to 1 hour of her time. If you both work the same number of hours, you should split the bill proportional to your income. That would be fair. You seem to think your 1 hour of life is worth more than her 1 hour of life. You should definitely skip out on the dating scene like you suggested.", "YTA. When my husband and I first lived together I made significantly more than him. We split rent 50/50 but all other bills including groceries we balanced out and I paid for \u201cmore\u201d.  Being in a relationship is about working together not shaming the other person for their lower paying job and impoverishing them. Just because you make more doesn\u2019t mean you \u201cwork harder\u201d or \u201chave a nicer job\u201d. Now that I re-read this though this must be troll. And if not I have so many questions? What\u2019s wrong with the \u201cghetto\u201d? How did you lower your living standard? Sounds like she wanted to live within your combined means and you wanted to live within your EGO. Yuck.\n\nEdited to add: Good for her for having boundaries and walking away.  Sounds like she was willing to lower her standards but had second thoughts and chose to walk away.", "Wait a minute, you mean to tell me that I could \"just get a better job?!\" Ohhh...I'll get right on that! You sound like a vile, materialistic and condescending individual. I'm not sure why she moved in with you in the first place. You make 3 times as much as her, and you refused to get a place within her budget. You absolutely SHOULD have been paying more. YTA, a MASSIVE one!", "Based on all of your comments, I absolutely do not believe that you want input and real answers, so I\u2019m not about to waste my time on those. \n\nBut definitely YTA. \n\nGood thing your lease was temporary.", "YTA and with zero understanding of equality.

You also seem to be assuming that the entire economy operates on the basis of some sort of perfect justice, and that if you make more money than someone else that you are more valuable as a human being. Oh, and also, that people can easily triple their income if they just make a bit of effort.\n\nMost people in serious relationships are looking for someone with whom they can engage in a healthy give-and-take. You\u2014and anyone you date\u2014could get sick unexpectedly and be totally without income. Lots people would like to think their significant other would have their back if they fell on hard times.\n\nYou just don\u2019t sound interested in being a true partner to another human being.

Money is obviously more important to you than anything \ud83d\ude44", "Did you see yourself going on holidays with this girl? Having children? I can see her point because you didn't earn a little bit more you literally earn triple her income.\nIf i earned triple my husband I would pay more if he let me, and if he didn't let me then I'd happily pay for things like holidays and buy him stuff. I already do buy him stuff as I earn more and I know he can't afford it like I can. Money isn't important when you have a good relationship so maybe she either want right for you or you need to rethink your priorities?", "YTA for belittling your now ex. You think you are better than her. She wanted a cheaper place, and you didn't. You went with another option. You feel like you downgraded. She knows she downgraded after how you talk about her (because you worker harder and have a better job, it sounds like a personal problem, etc.). \n\nYou breaking up with her was her blessing in disguise. Now she can be happy.", "YTA. \n\nBeing in a relationship should NOT be a financial WINDFALL for one and a financial DETERMINANT to another. You make 3xs what she does. She was giving you options that she can afford, which you call ghetto. You wanted a place that was in YOUR budget not HERS. Both should be able to save money and enjoy disposable income. 50/50 in a place she could not afford would not allow her to do that. \n\nBeing in a relationship is also about compromise and consideration for your partner. You can\u2019t just dismiss what she\u2019s doing and say she could get a better job. You know good and well that $120,000 jobs come with certain specialties. \n\n\nBeing in a relationship is also a commitment to build together. You don\u2019t have to put everything in the pot but you do have to be fair and pull together to get what you both want. You pay a little more money, she does more cooking. \n\nYour either committed or your not. There\u2019s o such thing as \u201ctesting\u201d the waters. If you don\u2019t swim you will sink.", "Everything about this says troll.", "YTA. Stop dating peasants if you don't want to lower your standard of living. Obviously, if you're making $120k and she's making $40k then she's not going to want to spend half her income on rent. If you ever plan on being in a serious relationship with shared finances you're going to have to get over this problem you have otherwise only date women who make as much as you do.

Then you pay for the upgrade. You don't get to dictate that your SO pays higher rent, too.\n\nSame thing when it comes to going out to eat.

A 50/50 split of living expenses is equally, but not necessarily equitable or fair.  Let's break this down.\n\nYour income of 120k, I presume before taxes, comes down to 10k/month, again before taxes and other deductions.  Even if taxes and deductions are eating up 30% of your paycheck, that's still 90k annually or 7.5k monthly.  Half of that $1900 rent is $950; you'd barely feel that.\n\nHer income of 40k leaves her with $3,333/month, less than that with taxes and other deductions.  $950 out of that is almost a full fucking third of her monthly income.  I don't know about her other bills and expenses, like a car loan, student loans, car insurance, etc., but I wouldn't be surprised if those are combining to eat up another large chunk of her income.  That does make it difficult if not impossible for her to save money, especially if other household expenses are split 50/50.\n\nWhen there is such a massive income disparity between partners, the common wisdom is to divide household expenses based on income share.  In your case, you arguably should have been 75% of the household expenses, while she paid the remaining 25%.  The fact that she was only asking for a 60/40 split was generous as all hell of her.  If you're going to insist on splitting living expenses 50/50 with future partners, maybe do yourself a favor and stick to people in your own tax bracket.", "YTA but it was definitely the right decision for you to break up. \n\nShe deserves a partner who supports her and is willing to make sacrifices for the betterment of the relationship. \n\nYou need someone who is on the same page as you in regards to finances. It sounds like you will likely be a good fit for someone who makes the same amount as you and has the same approach to finances and equality as you do you can be \u201ceven\u201d about everything. This essentially excludes any woman who would make less than you, more than you, or require you to sacrifice more time or effort at any point in the relationship. This will be hard and is less common than you might imagine.\n\nThe truth is that most relationships are about give and take. There are different seasons in every relationship that require different sacrifices from each person. \n\nWhen my DH and I first started dating we spent a year where things were pretty even cost wise. A year later he went back to school and wasn\u2019t working. I got us a new place and we moved in together, but he did not pay a cent of rent, but helped with utilities etc (obviously a small fraction of what rent would be have been). This lasted about 3 years. Then we moved into a house together. At that point I started having kids and so he started paying a greater share of the mortgage as I was working less and putting more of my time and energy (also called earning potential) toward home and childcare. \n\nAt some point the seasons will change again and we will also shift financial responsibilities. Of course some of this is different as we are married, but we also spent 4 years dating where we shared finances. No, they were not 50:50 the vast majority of the time but it didn\u2019t matter because we had mutual respect, trust and a commitment to support each other in our individual and shared life goals.\n\nI think you might think you broke up because of a financial problem but in actuality you guys broke up because you have a rigidity problem and might lack compassion, empathy and understanding. These are ultimately necessary for a sustained and fruitful relationship regardless of the financial split.", "YTA. You are confusing \"fair\" and \"equal\". \"Equal\" is splitting 50-50. \"Fair\" would be 60-40.\n\nThink of it this way. There's a 5 foot fence and there's two people: A who's 6 foot and B who's 4 foot. You give both people a 6 inch tall box to see over the fence. That is *equal*. However, B still cannot see over the fence. The *equal* treatment is not *fair*. It would be *fair* if you gave both boxes to B, because A doesn't need the extra 6 inches, while B needs the hole extra foot. So, not equal, but fair.", "YTA - She was only asking for a 60/40 split when you make 3x more than her? I'm glad she sees what a life would be like with you now before it's too late.

If there is a big discrepancy in the amount of time you and her work, say you do 60 hour weeks and she does 40, then she can make up for this time discrepancy by contributing more to domestic duties such as cooking, cleaning, grocery shopping etc.\n\nIf you want an equal 50/50 split to be even close to fair, you have to compromise by ensuring your living situation (mainly rent) is within her budget to afford. It isn't much of a fair relationship/ partnership if you're living comfortably and your partner is treading water living paycheck to paycheck. \n\nBy the time you're both considered de facto or even get married, earnings become shared assets anyway under most legal jurisdictions. \n\nI don't want to call you the AH here necessarily, but you definitely need to learn what is and isn't fair in a relationship as I've outlined above.", "Look up the difference between equity and equality, my dude.
