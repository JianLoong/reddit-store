Of course princesses are real, not that you need anyone to tell you. Saying it's propaganda is weird as can be...does he think Harry and Meghan are an advance party for a resumption of royal rule in the US?", "NTA - You told her the truth (although monarchy exists outside of the UK).", "NTA\n\nBuy your brother must be right peeved when they learn history... The British Royal family is has prominent part in any history book...\n\nPropaganda? You shared FACTS I worry that your brother treats factual education as propaganda...", "uh... what do you mean with \"she believes in dinosaurs\" like? as in that they still exist? orrrrr", "NTA, but i\u2019d drop it with the BIL, no point arguing with crazy. Maybe if your niece brings it up again, you can share with her other countries\u2019 princesses. There are plenty more in the world.", "NTA The royal family is real, why is your BIL in disbelief and taking it too seriously??", "NTA You did absolutely nothing wrong. Your brother sounds unhinged.", "NTA, she would have eventually found out about the royal family? Or was your BIL just expecting to keep the world away from her forever? When I was a kid I was obsessed with knights and someone explained to me that they still exist. Showed the difference between then and now, also showed people role-playing/larping and how those are not knights but pretending to be etc. It's good to teach your niece something about her interests.", "NTA - This is baffling to be honest. Just absolutely a bizarre reaction from your BIL.", "NTA\n\nAs an aside though- the end of your post is confusing. You made a point that your niece \u201cbelieves in Santa and dinosaurs.\u201d You realize one\u2019s fictional and the other is real, right? It was just a really weird add. The equivalent example is dinosaurs because they\u2019re real. Did you just throw in Santa to demonstrate she\u2019s still in the stage of life where imaginary beings exist? I\u2019m very curious as to your thinking.", "NTA? What the hell? Your husband is right, leave it, but you are absolutely NTA for telling your niece a real life FACT. It's not she isn't going to learn this herself eventually - there are so many monarchies in the world, after all.", "NTA ...
