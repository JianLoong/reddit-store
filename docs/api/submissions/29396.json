Super creepy", "no need for the last line, 3rd line was clearly Canadian. \nBombers did go tonight, beat up the Elks, but everyone's doing that this year\n:)", "My yard IS properly maintained. Our HOA does \u201cYard of the Month\u201d and in 2.5 years I\u2019ve won 7 times, including last month.", "There\u2019s no indication that the HOA cares about someone\u2019s backyard.  Steve, the rude AH, thinks the HOA has rules about backyards but AHs like him tend to the assume the rules are what he thinks they should be and often don\u2019t know anything about the actual rules.", "Op nta", "He can. The president of the HOA lives across the street from me and he told me not to worry. But as I was planning on doing anyways, mowed this morning.", "HOA\u2019s are racists Time Capsule and can go be banished from history", "Some cities even have guidelines about this.", "NTA\n\nTrees along the fence line. Not a fence, but a screen.\n\nAnd the new neighbor is an AH.", "NTA\n\n\nI found a thing that I had previously not known existed: hedge walls in planters with wheels. \n\n\nNot only does it seem like an option that no HOA could have anticipated making a rule about, but it has the added benefit of being able to be repurposed as a hedge maze in your yard... \n\n\nWhich also seems awesome to me for Halloween \ud83c\udf83\ud83d\udc7b", "You can plant tall shrubs or a sprinkler that can go off at anytime. \ud83d\ude2c", "Can you put up a trellis and fire honeysuckle/clematis?", " Bet a weeks pay nibby neighbor will be calling the HOA to report this shockingly long grass.", "How about a sun sail? It isn't permanent and it would block his view without touching the house or his side of the fence.", "Grow a tall hedge along the fence?", "You should look into, Expectation of Privacy laws. It may come in handy for you if he just pops his head over to be nosey", "I\u2019m not sure how it is in Texas, but where I\u2019m at HOAs can only make complaints about infractions seen from the street. They are not allowed to step one foot on your property.\n\nSo for me I just make sure my front lawn is taken care of and do my backyard at my leisure. This helps me since I travel for work a lot.\n\nYou may look into that so if you feel like going a couple weeks without mowing the back and your neighbor says something you can say you aren\u2019t in violation of HOA guidelines.", "HOAs exist for a reason.  No one wants to live next to someone with two feet tall grass and cars parked on their lawn.  Even if there isn\u2019t an HOA many cities have ordinances that enforce similar rules.", "Plant bamboo along your fence. It grows really quickly and will provide a barrier between your yard and the fence.", "Don't increase the height of the fence, raise the lawn. \nIf this is your permanent home it's an option to side step HOA policy.", "Can you set up motion sprinklers?? Aim it at the fence. \ud83d\ude0a", "How about cameras?", "HOAs are the devil (I call mine The Goatfuckers in conversation bc it gives me petty satisfaction) but nobody forced the neighbor to do shit. The length of OP's grass is between OP and the HOA, the neighbor wasn't going to get fined for not reminding her about it enough. The neighbor just felt like being nosy and judgmental.", "Yes, I've read the poem. Having lived in many different places, I still support the need to \"wall out\" intrusive busy-bodies like this AH neighbor. Imagine poor OP's life without that fence. I wonder, too, whether Frost's neighbor in the poem considered him a busy-body! Nature and  gravity pull down walls, but as long as there is such a thing as real property, and people are AHs about it, there will be a need for fences to keep the peace.", "Yup. I am thinking if OP was getting fines from the HOA they would certainly do it more often. Also, it's a frickin fenced in backyard. Even if it is super long, honestly, no one is going to know unless they peek over your fence violating your right to privacy", "Not for fenced back yards.

Never heard of em before and now I want them.", "Or OP just has to hose her fence down anytime he pokes his head over. Oops, got to maintain that backyard", "Say no to bamboo. It\u2019s worse than the neighbor!", "until it decides to go under the fence and establish a new defense zone on the neighbours side....", "I love bamboo but it is actually illegal in some places because it is so invasive", "You really spotted the hole in my theory.", "Quoting out of context in order to support the opposite argument of the original text is bad form.", "Yeah I was thinking Mr Tall, Nosy and Annoying should deal with the lawn if it bothers them so much. Rude that.", "Also tall bushes because they might be easier to plant\n\nDo NOT try bamboo though. I did this and it grows tall but also grows OUT underground! It started pushing up my paving stones 4 METRES AWAY from the original plantation LOL. It can be kept pruned easily when it starts pushing up but I was very surprised. Did not do my research! Looked pretty though haha.\n\nI can simply laugh at my bamboo situation though because I've since moved and don't have to deal with it now. Oops \ud83d\ude02\n\nHope you find a solution! New neighbour seems a butthole with too much time on his hands", "Or fasten a \"sun sail\" to the top of the fence. When he looks over he'll see only fabric not the lawn", "Trees or pretty bushes like bougainvillea, which grow tall and very thick and come in many flower colors. You can grow them in Texas. Also? Naked sunbathing at random. And if he complains to the HOA about that, point out that your fence is 6-feet-tall, so....", "If allowed, you can set up a short trellis at the top of the fence and grow some leafy climber plants.", "You can raise the fence a few feet, so there's a gap at the bottom. Then, mind a whole bunch of dirt at the bottom. The fence is still 6 feet tall just on top of raised dirt.", "Or tiny flower pots or pinwheels along the top?!", "Bamboo \ud83d\ude08", "Plant a row of Red Tip Photinias along your fence. They grow well in Texas and make a great privacy fence.", "Huge fan of this. But, unfortunately, there are watering restrictions.

Plus, longer grass has a longer root system, and is healthier in a drought.", "I don't know the proper way to post a link; we'll see if this works:\n\n\nhttps://artigwall.com/\n\n\nBut if not, the company is Artigwall\n\n\nNow, how do I go about getting a commission for this?", "Oh yeah \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23", "Not the fence, just the planters on the side of it, lol... hang the pots high enough that it is very easy to splash him if he sticks his nose where it doesn't belong.", "Very well.", "or raspberry plants - those spread like crazy!!  Though I was going to suggest to plant them and be an annoying neighbor.", "A previous neighbor started bamboo that took over an area outside our fence.  We own that area though.... Imagine our surprise to find a man and his wife happily harvesting the bamboo with plans to put it in small dishes to sell. My spouse sent them away---but it was a an interesting day.", "Absolutely!  I haven't watered my lawn in years, and it is as green or greener than neighbors with sprinkler systems watering frequently and the neighbor whose service mows every Monday morning regardless of whether grass has grown or he is just scraping up dust.  If you have to have grass, leave it to live as naturally as possible.", "These motion sprinklers run for about 5-10 seconds each detection.", ">Now, how do I go about getting a commission for this?\n\nI think you'd have to get a special link from the company that tells them that whomever uses it to purchase something was sent by you, and you then get some sort of kickback from it... some places call them affiliate links.", "omg someone offered to cut back some of the bamboo and you sent them away???", "Liability issues--it's a steep. irregular  side. \n\nThe bamboo occ shows up in our yard proper but not really a problem because we go at it quickly"]}
