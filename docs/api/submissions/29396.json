Yesterday was a WFH day for me and I was out back with my dog getting some fresh air between meetings. Steve was in his backyard and we\u2019re friendly enough to say hey or whatever. Steve is also tall and can see well over the 6 foot privacy fence. He\u2019s not creepy about it or anything but still. He poked his head over and we made small talk. Apparently he had been mowing his lawn and asked if I was \u201cever going to get around to\u201d mowing my lawn.\n\nI wasn\u2019t sure if I heard him right so I said \u201cwhat?\u201d and he repeated himself. Now my lawn is not crazy long. We live in Texas and don\u2019t get much rain, coupled with watering restrictions there just isn\u2019t much to keep up with. Either my boyfriend or I usually mow every 2ish weeks on Saturday mornings. He loves mowing so if he can come do it I let him. I told Steve that it was going to get done today and his response was \u201cYou don\u2019t look too busy right now, what\u2019s stopping you.\u201d I responded that it was the middle of the work day (around 1pm) and thatI had several more meetings and reports to handle and couldn\u2019t just skip out for the rest of the day.\n\nHis response to this was to call me lazy and remind me of HOA violation potential. I told him a day wouldn\u2019t make a difference and if it bothered him so much he was free to mow my lawn for me. He told me there was no need to be an asshole and he was \u201cjust looking out for me.\u201d I wished him a nice day and my dog and I went back into the house.
