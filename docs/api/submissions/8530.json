So did my BIL who\u2019s father had diabetes. My mom caught it a few times with me and then explained to my husband what to look out for. \n\nThis isn\u2019t a vindictive attempt at embarrassing her, it\u2019s looking out for her medical welfare.", "NTA- but nobody here on reddit is going to have an opinion that means more to you than your wife. If I were you I'd apologize for the miscommunication and move on.", "NAH. Both high and low blood sugar can be smelled. That's why they have diabetes dogs that alert to both conditions. Ketoacidosis smells fruity and nail varnishy and high blood sugar smells sugary. My MIL has poorly controlled diabetes and I can smell both. Not sure why your wife would be upset by this, as it's a useful skill to have.", "NAH. This just sounds like a misunderstanding by a pregnant lady dealing with a lot.", "NAH. Assuming you smelled a fruity nail polish remover-esque scent on her breath she was in keto-acidosis. If that is the case it means her brain likely was likely struggling to get enough energy and it was a really serious situation combined with the high blood sugar. If that is the case explain to her that you smelled the keytones in her breath and that she should probably call her OB and probably see an endo ASAP.  \n\n\nPregnancy + very high blood sugar is not a recipe for easy rational thought, if she was in DKA as well her brain probably wasn't running at 100% even before the impact of the high blood glucose.", "NTA. You made an honest (and accurate) observation and she took it wrong. Chalk it up to the emotional upheavals that happen during pregnancy, plus the diabetes issue just makes everything that much harder to deal with.", "NTA  I have a keen sense of smell. I always knew when my kids were going to get sick by the smell of their breath when they were babies and toddlers. Not throw up sick but cold and fever sick. Of course I had to stop that at some point because they were getting older and they didn't want me smelling their breathe and I certainly didn't want to smell it at this point. But yes, it's a thing.", "NTA Low and high sugars can both be smelled. I am sure your wife has cared for service dogs used to detect sugar changes in people. I am not sure why she doesn\u2019t see this.", "NTA, but as someone who has had GD, I can understand the frustration. GD is so hard and exhausting and it\u2019s easy to get irritable when you are already uncomfortable from pregnancy too.", "NTA\n\nIt's absolutely true that people with blood sugar issues smell differently, both breath and perspiration.", "NTA. High blood sugar is nothing to mess around with. Not evryone who has high blood sugar goes into DKA, but if someone does go into DKA, it can kill them if not treated. Better safe than sorry.", "NAH\n\n1. She doesn't understand your developed medical senses.  You just have to show her dogs doing it.  \n\n2. Of course your wife is offended.  The conversation was important to her. \n\n3. Dude!  No conversation or topic is as important as the life of your only.  So it's understandable you can't remember.  You love that girl like no other and nothing is more important!!!", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
