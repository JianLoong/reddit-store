If she isn't, just tell her the same thing. If she makes a big fuss about it mention something similar about growing up etc.", "Don't ask reddit how you should prioritize your values. \n\nEither your personal values prioritize family or your values prioritize your social life. Both values are equally acceptable only you can decide which one matters more to you", "NTA - You won't be TA if you tell your family what you've written here: you're starting a new chapter in your life and want to experience it with the people around you in that experience", "NTA. However, can you not Zoom or FaceTime your brother to wish him a happy birthday? I bet he'd appreciate that.\n\nMaybe get him a gift.\n\nYour parents shouldn't expect you to always be there especially as you're an adult. Being out of state is the perfect excuse to live your own life.\n\nWith that being said, don't use it as an excuse to cut off yourself from your family. Especially a sibling that it sounds like you love.\n\nEnjoy your New Years!\n\nEDIT: Hell, I know it might not fly with your parents. Their focus on family time sounds a bit overbearing when your in your 20s. But a great gift, if it works out with timing, would be if he visited you like a day after. Usually school is off during the break and him staying for a couple days on Monday and Tuesday of the following week to break in the city with you and your friends would be a hell of a present. Let's him get away from your parents too.", "Tricky situation. However, I think YTA if you choose to miss a milestone birthday for your brother without at least talking to him about it. With that said, I think this is a special moment for your family and that it is important you are there.\n\nWe all make sacrifices for family and celebrating milestone events is one of them. (I want to be clear: this is if you have a good relationship with your family. If this is an abusive situation, then disregard my comment).", "NTA \n\nIt seems like it will be too much this year to be flying back and forth, especially with a new job.", "NTA you just need to decide what you want to do and very nicely tell your brother and mom. Don\u2019t argue or debate just tell them and then don\u2019t keep having a long talk over and over- that will lead to more problems. Decide and then nicely hold your ground.", "Why don't you ask your brother if he minds. It's his birthday after all. Maybe he doesn't want to spend his birthday with family either ?", "NTA.  Your brother's birthday is December 31.  You have all day to celebrate with him and they you can go out with your friends in the evening.  Just because someone's birthday is on a holiday doesn't mean you are obligated to do the traditional holiday celebrations with them.", "NAH\n\nI wouldn't mention the \"new chapter in your life\" bit. \n\nJust tell them (now, so they have time to get over any disappointment) that your program is beginning January 4 and you want to be there a week in advance to get yourself organized. Do whatever for your brother's birthday (give him his gift, take him out for dinner, etc.) right before you leave. \n\nI mean, he's 18; I'm surprised *he* hasn't rebelled against spending every New Year's with his family already.", "NTA. Enjoy getting to know your new environment. Sounds like some space between you and your family is a healthy move. \nMost likely your 18 year old brother would rather spend his birthday with his friends too.", "NTA.  \nThey can't expect you to fly home and back in time to start school anyways. Go out, have fun with your friends and meet people in your new city. Make it up to him on his 21st and take him out somewhere.", "I don't celebrate my birthday with my family and i live with them...do what you feel best leave him a card and present and know life changes and you can't be everywhere all the time.", "Definitely not. I guess I\u2019m having a hard time of this year being the first year, when it is his 18th :(", "Tbh, I can't say this about everybody, but I had rather have my older siblings be there for my 21st than my 18th.", "My brother is a pretty chill person. I can see my brother saying oh yeah it\u2019s okay even if he will still be slightly hurt. But he\u2019s also the type to say it and mean it. My mom on the other hand would be the one to directly tell me she\u2019s upset and unhappy with it", "Oh absolutely would video call him and get him a gift! My mom is definitely the type to expect me to do that unfortunately. And I definitely would not use that as an excuse to cut myself off! I would miss them too much. My brother wouldn\u2019t want to come visit me. I am driving to this state (16 hour drive) cause I need my car there, and he didn\u2019t want to come with to help or keep me company because he \u201cdidn\u2019t want to\u201d lol can\u2019t imagine him wanting to fly to visit. He would miss his video games too much", "Completely agree. I would definitely talk to him and the family about it before making anything official. But I guess I\u2019m still figuring out if missing his 18th is really worth it just to celebrate new years in my new home town. And we have our riff rafts as most families do, but in general we have a good dynamic.", "I can see him being the type to say he doesn\u2019t mind but deep down he does a little, or saying he doesn\u2019t and actually mean it. He has maybe 1 or 2 good friends but regardless I totally see him choosing to spend it with family, and playing video games with his online friends lol", "Great advice thank you! Knowing me I would have definitely mentioned the new chapter in my life part. Now that I think about it I could see my mom getting upset crafting something about my new chapter not involving family \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f and my brother is more on the stay at home and play video games side. He has 1-2 good friends in person and a girl he just met who he really likes. Maybe he will want to do something with her lol! Thanks for the input. I\u2019ll definitely talk to him and the family about it", "I wouldn't worry about it too much.  He might be in the same boat, telling his friends that he'd rather hang out with them but he has to have a party with his sister so she doesn't feel bad.", "I mean ideally she should be at both.", "Yeah but your moms opinion doesn't matter in this case at all lol", "19th birthday and I would say whatever. Celebrate the day before and go have your fun. But this is a big deal and you not going could sour your relationship with your brother. Is that an outcome you want to risk?"]}
