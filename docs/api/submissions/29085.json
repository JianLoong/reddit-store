For fucks sake, I was not a hot 8 year old", "It does in fact not matter what you were. People get assaulted in every fucking outfit possible.\n\nHer saying she 'slayed' is normal talk for a teenager, no need to pity her.", "Or a cute outfit? Why do y\u2019all think it\u2019s for sexual attention damn", "What you wrote are for the sane people. No sane adult will sexualize a minor. But we are talking about the assaulters here. They don't see age, or anything. All they see is a body they like. And they damage it. So, I don't think the father is wrong here. All he tried to do was protect his daughter.  The way he did it? Wrong, yes. But intentions were good.", "Those are two different things. There is not a 'safe' outfit that protects you.\n\nShe does sound a little naive (which is acceptable for her age), but if something happens it is never the result of the outfit.", "Yeah I thought the same. Just because SA and the like CAN and DO happen to women in ALL kinds of clothing doesn't mean OP has to \"provocate\" anything. Not taking the blame off the men, but it's just as likely that a guy wouldn't take note of a modestly dressed girl but will get interested in a short dress... It's so sad we even have to talk or think about what to wear...", "The father is the one who was swearing, sweety.", "Do you need some pearls to clutch, Great-Aunt Muriel?", "OK granny.", "Yes, because telling teenagers to sneak around behind their parents backs is totally a lesson we need to be teaching\u2026", "And this is somehow the woman's fault? I'm honestly not sure what you're trying to say here, but I will say that the very concept of \"daddy issues\" is truly peak casual misogyny: a man's mistreatment of a woman becomes an insult for men to use against that woman.\n\nAs I used to tag posts about my father's bullshit with, back in my Tumblr days: I only have daddy issues because my father is an asshole.", "1. Bad men do bad things from the fact they're bad people. We will not victim blame here, anyone can wear what they want.\n\n2. That's not what her dad said. He didn't say the situation was unsafe, not that the party was unsafe, he said her outfit was unsafe. Whenever my parents said they felt somewhere I wanted to go wasn't safe, I listened and I stayed home without arguing, 100% of the time. And yeah, when I was a kid I probably would disobey them out of spite if they felt the need to act like children and insult me instead of talking to me with respect. OP is a kid, and she acted how teenagers act when adults choose to insult them and yell at them without even attempting proper discussion. Yeah she should've chose different actions, but I will not hold her to the standards of an adult when the actual adult in the situation won't even act like one.", "You should have a look at Dove - What Were You Wearing Exhibit. It shows clothes victims were wearing before they were sexually assaulted.

It does not matter what they are wearing.", "do you think assault and rape simply didn\u2019t happen before women started being allowed to wear skimpy things? do you think victorian women with multiple petticoats and floor length gowns didn\u2019t get raped? do you also think only attractive women get raped? you don\u2019t have a damn clue. quit the victim blaming.", "If that were the case only pretty girls in sexy clothes would be assaulted\u2026 sorry to tell you this but this comment makes you sounds like a predator.", "Bad men get ideas from women breathing... and often not breathing.  Stop victim blaming.", "Bad men getting bad ideas from good looking girls is not the good looking girls\u2019 problem - it\u2019s the men\u2019s problem.

Just because you wouldn't be able to control yourself doesn't make it the VICTIMS fault.", "Bad men get bad ideas because they are bad men. Men are perfectly capable of controlling their urges.

I think it's VERY obvious that she's trying to frame things to get a desired response... which is what I said, but even in the context of her telling half truths he didn't say anything sexist. He said her skirt was too tight and he was trying to protect her. That isn't sexist, you could say it's overbearing, possibly even controlling, you seem to be projecting with that sexist comment. I would assert that he saw the skirt and we didn't, he's her father and we're not, he would have a better read on the situation than us. And the mom agrees too. But my contempt is informed by things like he says her skirt is too tight and her only counter is that she has to dress like a fucking nun to leave the house? Doesn't seem like she's giving a thought out and reasoned portrayal of events or understands degrees, only extremes. I think my contempt is warranted and when her story is put through that filter I get a rather different read on this than you I feel. But to each their own.", "Don\u2019t see that, only that he was yelling.
