So, why?", "There seems to be a big lack of info.\n\nyou never told us why he did this. usually kids don't do this out of spite for TWO DECADES\n\nthere seems to a very valid reason. which you don't seem comfortable telling. Also given your son's reaction, he seems to have emotionally distanced himself from both of you. Probably for the same reason as to why he started calling you by your names.\n\nUsually for a kid to \"abandon\" their blood relatives and choose \"strangers\" as their new family, a lot of bad shit has to happen.\n\nUntil you tell us what happened/anyone involved in this story giving us proper context, I am gonna say YTA. It sounds like you are trying to emotionally blackmail him.", "YTA. \n\nHere's the thing: there's a reason he calls you by your first name. And to keep it up for 20 years, not just in a moment of teenage attitude, means it is a *big, important* reason that would have been impossible for a healthy person to miss. You need to stop having emotional outbursts (which everyone, even your husband, is clearly tired of) and honestly evaluate yourself. Get a professional (therapist) to help you dig through it all and to help you work on emotional regulation and self-awareness. \n\nIn the meantime, work to minimize the impact of your outbursts on other people. Don't wait for your husband to leave the room, go ahead and leave before you start leaking. Take a walk, journal, quietly reflect, and come back when you're ready to interact with people in a healthy, non-coersive way.", "I was reading an article recently, about how narcissistic parents tend to shower attention on their kids when in public, and how they turn on them when they stop being mindless-children. Those parents turn on the kids once they start growing up and the narc parent can't control them completely. \n\nthe loss of the \"sweet innocent baby boy\" reminded me of that.\n\nBut hey, so did the emotional manipulation... and you thinking that your son is somehow to blame and not that your an your husband's upbringing/parenting style and personality/disorders affected him so much that he knew there wasn't genuine love there. \n\n\"No-one offered to comfort me for a while\" - forgot this one too! Your performance fell a bit flat or the audience has recognized the manipulation for what it is.\n\nIt might be super duper helpful if you spoke with a mental health expert and did a fun little quiz to see if there is anything about your outlook on life that makes you treat your child horribly but you're unaware of it. \n\nI know to YOU it may feel people are against you, and people don't understand, but if you talk to a professional and get some insight into yourself, your relationships can be better. Use this as a wake up call. You and your husband somehow mistreated your son so much that he is unable to connect with you with affection.

But... experience says there's probably a lot there to unpack.\n\nAlso, using \"despise\" to talk about your son's behaviour, thinking he said something that's likely very natural for him just to spite you, the crying that nobody felt compelled to take seriously and complaining about the loss of the small child who didn't know you could do anything bad are classic narcissistic traits.

You and your husband pretty much did this to yourselves. You pushed him into a place where he no longer saw you as \"mom\" and \"dad\", simply as authority figures.

That\u2019s just how he refers to them and it was natural. \n\nYou reacting that way may have been a natural response on your part. \n\nThe problem is that you have obviously done nothing to heal the gaping wound that already exists between you and your son.
