So, why?", "There seems to be a big lack of info.\n\nyou never told us why he did this. usually kids don't do this out of spite for TWO DECADES\n\nthere seems to a very valid reason. which you don't seem comfortable telling. Also given your son's reaction, he seems to have emotionally distanced himself from both of you. Probably for the same reason as to why he started calling you by your names.\n\nUsually for a kid to \"abandon\" their blood relatives and choose \"strangers\" as their new family, a lot of bad shit has to happen.\n\nUntil you tell us what happened/anyone involved in this story giving us proper context, I am gonna say YTA. It sounds like you are trying to emotionally blackmail him.", "YTA. \n\nHere's the thing: there's a reason he calls you by your first name. And to keep it up for 20 years, not just in a moment of teenage attitude, means it is a *big, important* reason that would have been impossible for a healthy person to miss. You need to stop having emotional outbursts (which everyone, even your husband, is clearly tired of) and honestly evaluate yourself. Get a professional (therapist) to help you dig through it all and to help you work on emotional regulation and self-awareness. \n\nIn the meantime, work to minimize the impact of your outbursts on other people. Don't wait for your husband to leave the room, go ahead and leave before you start leaking. Take a walk, journal, quietly reflect, and come back when you're ready to interact with people in a healthy, non-coersive way.", "I was reading an article recently, about how narcissistic parents tend to shower attention on their kids when in public, and how they turn on them when they stop being mindless-children. Those parents turn on the kids once they start growing up and the narc parent can't control them completely. \n\nthe loss of the \"sweet innocent baby boy\" reminded me of that.\n\nBut hey, so did the emotional manipulation... and you thinking that your son is somehow to blame and not that your an your husband's upbringing/parenting style and personality/disorders affected him so much that he knew there wasn't genuine love there. \n\n\"No-one offered to comfort me for a while\" - forgot this one too! Your performance fell a bit flat or the audience has recognized the manipulation for what it is.\n\nIt might be super duper helpful if you spoke with a mental health expert and did a fun little quiz to see if there is anything about your outlook on life that makes you treat your child horribly but you're unaware of it. \n\nI know to YOU it may feel people are against you, and people don't understand, but if you talk to a professional and get some insight into yourself, your relationships can be better. Use this as a wake up call. You and your husband somehow mistreated your son so much that he is unable to connect with you with affection.

But... experience says there's probably a lot there to unpack.\n\nAlso, using \"despise\" to talk about your son's behaviour, thinking he said something that's likely very natural for him just to spite you, the crying that nobody felt compelled to take seriously and complaining about the loss of the small child who didn't know you could do anything bad are classic narcissistic traits.

YTA.", "YTA so by your very sparce comments your husband insisted your children call you sir/ma'am and that you were controlling because his answer that he gave you despite it not being 'a true answer' in your opinion is that he called you that because you couldn't control what he said, also the crying being manipulative thing your son hinted at seems in my opinion something you have a pattern for doing which makes him immune and even tired of it", "YTA. You and your husband pretty much did this to yourselves. You pushed him into a place where he no longer saw you as \"mom\" and \"dad\", simply as authority figures.

That\u2019s just how he refers to them and it was natural. \n\nYou reacting that way may have been a natural response on your part. \n\nThe problem is that you have obviously done nothing to heal the gaping wound that already exists between you and your son.

It's unfair to judge a situation that's been in play for what, 30/40 years? But you need to work through it if you want a healthy relationship with your son, your husband, and your own life. My stepdad is *still* in the process of opening up to us all as a human beings, and I can tell you it's worth it.

I'm pretty sure there was a reason for this. Especially if he used to call you mom and dad before. Could it have to do with homophobia ? Anyway if he calls them that, there must be something they are doing well that you didn't. He probably meant to say it in front of you, to show you something : that you failed him in a way, or that his step parents helped him in a way you never did ...

It also sounds like it would be healthy for you and those close to you to do some work on emotional regulation, that way you can be kind and care for yourself by telling your son how hurt that makes you and then managing yourself in private. You might feel like an emotional display will make sure he knows your distress is real, but it sounds like you are becoming inconsolable to the point where you cannot regulate yourself.

She certainly wasn\u2019t more mom than his mom.\n\nHave you tried talking to him about it when you are calm and able to discuss rationally? I expect the reason he asked you to step outside unless you were able to regulate your distress was because it\u2019s not very productive or healthy to just throw emotions at each other and if he is triggering you instead of helping you regulate, it would be better to be in separate spaces until you were able to do it yourself.", "There is so much missing from this story.

I wasn\u2019t saying I hated my mom or didn\u2019t ever want to touch her again, but maybe I just needed a \u201cbreather\u201d from the kissing?\n\nRegardless, she just refused. Every time I\u2019d leave her presence, she\u2019d aggressively corner me for a smooch. She\u2019d cry when I\u2019d pull away. It went on for years.
