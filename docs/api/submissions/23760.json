It sounds like you are trying to emotionally blackmail him.", "YTA. \n\nHere's the thing: there's a reason he calls you by your first name. And to keep it up for 20 years, not just in a moment of teenage attitude, means it is a *big, important* reason that would have been impossible for a healthy person to miss. You need to stop having emotional outbursts (which everyone, even your husband, is clearly tired of) and honestly evaluate yourself. Get a professional (therapist) to help you dig through it all and to help you work on emotional regulation and self-awareness. \n\nIn the meantime, work to minimize the impact of your outbursts on other people. Don't wait for your husband to leave the room, go ahead and leave before you start leaking. Take a walk, journal, quietly reflect, and come back when you're ready to interact with people in a healthy, non-coersive way.", "I was reading an article recently, about how narcissistic parents tend to shower attention on their kids when in public, and how they turn on them when they stop being mindless-children. Those parents turn on the kids once they start growing up and the narc parent can't control them completely. \n\nthe loss of the \"sweet innocent baby boy\" reminded me of that.\n\nBut hey, so did the emotional manipulation... and you thinking that your son is somehow to blame and not that your an your husband's upbringing/parenting style and personality/disorders affected him so much that he knew there wasn't genuine love there. \n\n\"No-one offered to comfort me for a while\" - forgot this one too! Your performance fell a bit flat or the audience has recognized the manipulation for what it is.\n\nIt might be super duper helpful if you spoke with a mental health expert and did a fun little quiz to see if there is anything about your outlook on life that makes you treat your child horribly but you're unaware of it. \n\nI know to YOU it may feel people are against you, and people don't understand, but if you talk to a professional and get some insight into yourself, your relationships can be better. Use this as a wake up call. You and your husband somehow mistreated your son so much that he is unable to connect with you with affection.

Her husband/family seems to have gotten used to her emotional outbursts to a point where it's just an annoyance to them. Especially for the husband. Their marriage doesn't seem very healthy.\nAnd I might be wrong there, but it sounds like the son and father had/still have a very difficult relationship.
