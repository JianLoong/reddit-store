We started talking about it the day after my post. There was actually a lot to talk about, because she had a lot of thoughts and feelings. \n\nWhen we started talking I told her about the post very quickly. She was initially put out by me making the post but after I explained that it was more for me to make sure I hadn\u2019t done something egregiously wrong and let her read through it at her own pace she was more okay with it. Though I did warn her that a lot of the comments were making wild assumptions about her. \n\nAfter she\u2019d read through my post, a few comments and my replies we talked about it a little. The main thing we talked about from the post was the silent treatment. She was very apologetic, and let me know that it wasn\u2019t her intention to be giving the silent treatment but can absolutely see that it would feel like that to me. She said that she was just struggling to parse through a lot of thoughts and emotions. \n\nLike I said in a comment, a big part of where our communication broke down was my flippancy when it came to helping her with money previously. To me it was showing that I was able to do it without hurting myself financially. To her it was me trying to stop her from worrying. Without the information I had I can definitely see how she thought that. She had always just assumed I was only doing a little better than her. \n\nThere was also a little bit of feeling bad about herself because of this. She\u2019s 26 and felt like because I was younger and had so much more she had failed. I reassured her that it wasn\u2019t a reflection on her and that I had just been very lucky. She asked me how I got the money, and said that she was also concerned I had done something illegal to make it. I broke down how I saved the money in detail for her. \n\nShe also expressed that she had already felt unworthy of me because I \u201cdo so much for her\u201d. I reassured her that I did things for her because I loved her, and that hadn\u2019t changed. I also explained everything she does for me and how to me I feel like she does so much more for me.\n\nShe was also worried about the power dynamic that this created. I reassured her that I didn\u2019t see us as any different and that what was mine, I viewed as hers. \n\nShe also said she was worried about what else I was hiding from her, and I reassured her that I wasn\u2019t hiding anything. I told her she was free to look through anything of mine anytime she wanted. She told me it wasn\u2019t necessary and that it was an emotional concern not actual distrust. \n\nObviously a week of reassurance isn\u2019t going to solve a lot of these emotions. We both already go to therapy separately and she is planning on bringing up a lot of this to her therapist by herself. We also decided that couples therapy would be a good idea. Not to repair our relationship because neither of us think it\u2019s broken, but to strengthen it and allow us to talk about the ways to most effectively communicate with each other.", "created_utc": 1695013135, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16lm98w/update_aita_for_hiding_my_saving_from_my_fianc\u00e9/", "score": 281, "replies": ["#[Original poast here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16cynk6/aita_for_hiding_my_saving_from_my_fianc%C3%A9/)", "I\u2019m glad this went well. Keep working on having open communication and remember there\u2019s no harm in taking a step back to gather your thoughts every once in a while (it beats saying something hurtful in the heat of the moment)", "rare communication W", "Sounds like you two had a lot to talk about and it's good that communication is the foundation of your relationship. You both seem to be on the same page now, so I think y'all will work through this just fine! Good luck :)", "This sounds like green progress \n\nMay I suggest you also discuss your long term financial goals and make it a team effort to get there \n\nI wish I had done that during my engagement and I wish I had this kind of support from my spouse later on\n\nDefinitely, being of the same mindset regarding financial goals and habits / behaviors is a great way to enter marriage", "This is such a Positive Update! What a great outcome! I love that you recognize that the Therapy will Strengthen your relationship! Good for you both! Best wishes for a Happy Future together!", "Trust, but verify. Please dont put your future at risk homie. You can love her without giving her 80k in equity btw: if she truly is the one she wont go anywhere right?\n\nGood luck!", "Get a prenup.", "It's refreshing to hear redditors who take advice to communicate with their spouses and have a positive reaction after they do. This initial post was vilifying OPs fiance assuming the worst of her when all that was required was open communication.", "Debts and financial obligations are \"bad news\", and need to be known from the start.  But \"good news\" like having a large net worth or a lot of money in savings can wait.", "If you\u2019re putting that much money down for a home, I would certainly get prenuptials if your fianc\u00e9 isn\u2019t contributing.", "wow good communication skills!! glad it worked out for you", "Love this for you two! Good to see real life examples of how many of our angry reactions are rooted in fear. \n\nAlso makes me chuckle just how many redditors were spot-on in their guesses (e.g. \"she's probably more focused on processing her emotions than communicating with you, ergo not the silent treatment in her eyes\" or \"she might wonder what else you've kept from her\"). Although this sub has its issues and biases spending time here has strengthened my ability to take a beat and consider multiple possible motivations instead of immediately assuming the worst in my own life.", "What a great update. I know people are recommending a prenup but I think that's going to be a stumbling block. I think most people use prenups to keep the other person from getting any of their stuff or money even if it isn't actually fair or reasonable. Like a prenup that dictates that the stay at home parent gets nothing in a divorce because the breadwinner \"earned it\". \n\nIf you take the approach that you need to protect yourself financially from her then don't bother getting married. \n\nIf you take the approach that you are going to protection both your interest and update it as life circumstances change then I think it might be a good idea. It's probably too soon to bring up though.", "Sounds like she managed to manipulate you into feeling sorry for her and you are still being asked if you're hiding anything else when you've done nothing wrong?\n\nThere are plenty of women out there without this type of baggage.", "It\u2019s one of the things all fianc\u00e9s should throughly discuss before marriage.  Maybe during pillow talk find a way to tell her how much you value her and her love.  The segway to finance can be done.  My wife and I decided to live on what I made, and she banked her salary, 28 years later we have our retirement money and the thing she feared all those years ago she can\u2019t remember why she did.", "This is awesome. This kind of reflection, communication, and growing is great for you, your relationship, and this reddit community. \n\nProps to you and your fiance for figuring it out and communicating through a tough time!", "That\u2019s a great update, OP! I\u2019m happy you two were able to talk things through.", "She wants your money.", "That is awesome! I personally am disabled and on a fixed income, so I know how she feels about that whole unworthy because she doesn\u2019t bring the same kinds of things to the table. It can be helpful for you to point out to her the things she does bring- the gestures she does that shows she cares, knowledge and skills you don\u2019t have, and others. \n\nCouples counseling changed my relationship for the better. It helps if you both go into it with the intent of both becoming better communicators. If no one is holding onto blame or thinking it\u2019s one person\u2019s fault you\u2019re there, you get to work faster. Congrats!", "I don't see this as manipulation. I get where she's coming from. Finding out after 2 years that a relationship that you thought was roughly equal (in terms of financial contribution) is very much not... it's not surprising that she has found that difficult to come to terms with. I know I would. The idea of being beholden to a partner to that extent - if he puts this massive nest egg into a house they co-own - is pretty unsettling, even if you love and trust them.", "Classic redditor."]}
