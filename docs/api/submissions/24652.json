She's used to you allowing this, so it's your fault.", "NTA she's disrespectful to everyone else's time.", "NTA\n\nThis is a logical natural consequence. If she was taking public transit or an Uber, being late would mean that she might not get a ride at all, well at least not without paying for the new ride. \n\nNot only did she hold you all back from going, she disrespected you to an extreme level and that is unacceptable. She can not speak to her parent that way and expect everyone is going to accommodate her chronic procrastination for an HOUR. \n\nYou had somewhere to be, she was not prepared to go after ample time, so she missed the event.

You could've told her you would be leaving without her before you just did but I don't blame you after all of that. She didn't even contact you until an hour AFTER you got to the party? So you waited an hour, drove for an hour, and then ANOTHER HOUR after that she calls to say she's ready? Not to mention the blatant disrespect of calling you a f'in idiot. No way. No sir. This girl is 18 years old and can't manage her time at all. She deserved to be left at home, she had plenty of opportunity and didn't need to completely disrespect you (as well as the rest of your family by not respecting their time) This is her fault and hers alone. I would never expect someone to wait that long for me, family or not, let alone call them names for checking on me", "Aside from either your math not mathing or you being inconsiderate enough to have already planned on arriving an hour late, you only missed 1 hour of the party, therefore 1/4 of it not 1/2 of it. Still fairly annoying. \n\nYou\u2019re NTA for leaving her, I\u2019d have left her a lot earlier than that. When you went in (after your wife already had) you should have told her you were leaving in 5 minutes with or without her instead of wasting everyone\u2019s time and allowing yourselves to be held hostage by someone rude and inconsiderate.", "NTA\n\nNope, my mom taught me when I was 8 that of I'm not ready when she is I get, and she did that by leaving me. \n\n\nShe's doesn't respect her family or their time, and she got want she deserved.", "NTA.  She needs to learn to respect other people's time. Late people miss things, they don't delay others.\n\nYou need to stop letting her be the last one to leave.  I flat out refuse to wait for family members in the car.  I will hover around and herd them until they make for the door.  It is surprisingly effective on people who are 'almost done.'", "NTA next time leave sooner tho", "Nope. She knew when the car was leaving. It's on her to be on time. From now on, don't wait for her. She'll either figure out not to do that or move out and get friends and/or partners will leave her, too.

Sounds like she needed this discipline a lot earlier in life", "INFO. I feel like the times are being heavily exaggerated here, it sounds like she was finally ready to go TWO hours since you guys first got to the car? I don't really believe that, and if that's the case then this wouldn't be the first time she must be late to something like that. If it is something you guys knew she would take forever to do, why not get her started earlier?", "Remember those old phones you could just press down and disconnect when you\u2019re being ignored? was handy at times..", "Um, I'm against violence, but even I would have slapped her across the room.

My kids would never do that because I told them from a young age, if you're not 10 minutes early, you're already late.", "I hope you addressed her calling you a f'n idiot. That's just awful.", "Whoa what ? I would pack her stuff and say bye bye get out you're 18 figure it or learn some respect and come home.", "Man I'll tell you what. The one and only time I ever said \"fuck\" to my dad in an insulting or rude way, was the last time (rightfully so).\n\nYou have some serious work to do here, dad, and part of it might be kicking your child out of the house after giving her enough time to get her act together. She clearly views you as just someone who has to provide for her whether you want to or not, and doesn't actually have any respect for you. Time to let her go out in the world and realize... oh fuck, dad was doing a lot for me.\n\nSelfish person living in her own fantasy world, and by the post, she does this regularly. Time to nip that in the bud, hard.", "NTA \nI agree with everyone saying you waited too long, I would have left long before an hour of waiting in the car.

YTA who is the parent who is the child here ?", "NTA. But\u2026\u2026 that\u2019s severely avoidant behavior.

You give them a boundary/time and then you leave if they are not ready. If she gets in the car and is acting out, you take action by returning her home, taking her to a city bus (if she's old enough and safe enough) and letting her go home, you don't take her the next time, etc.  There are multiple ways to parent your child to not be this way. You are NTA for leaving her at home - you should have taken action sooner.", "Well you clearly aren't hearing the end of it anyways...\n\nIf you make your parenting decisions based on what will rock the boat the least, you are doing it wrong. Realistically, you've known her for her entire life, therefore you know how long she takes to get ready. Even though she was on the phone a simple \"we leave at x time, either be ready or we'll assume that to mean you are staying home\" would work. Why you and your wife have allowed one child to carry on like this is beyond me.

If not, she knows how to manage her time and she just refuses to do so for you.", "Sorry.  That's just stupid. \nIf you had left her behind the 1st time she pulled that shit when she was old enough to be home alone, you may have had to do it again, but not over and over. \n\nI think you said Carrie is 18.\n\nI'd be tempted to start making living at home less cozy. She's to old too be pulling toddler shit that impacts the rest of the family. \n\nBy instituting new \"adult rules\"\n\n1. Contribute to household in a meaningful way. \n\n2. Be timely - leaving,  getting home, dinner\n\n3. Curfew - add a lock that she doesn't have a key for, lock it if she is late without a call,  if she calls, set a reasonable time based on situation.

My wife coddled our kids so much that my nick name for her was \"Peach Coddler\". My kids shown disrespect by being lazy and aloof to my requests. I had no problem taking away their things and I only had to physically discipline my son once. It was a quick pinch on the back of the upper arm. Hurts like hell for 30 seconds and boom its gone. I learned that one from one of my teachers doing it to me when I just would not stop talking in class time and time again. My point is, if I acted that way with my parents the way my kids are with me, I would have gotten some well deserved smacks; much more than what I actually got. \n\n30 years later, my wife still coddles our kids even though one is married and the other is a teacher. I will say this: Outside of the house, our kids were as respectful as I could ever hope. They never bullied, never judged, never smoke or drank, never fought, hell, they never cussed (lol) through their entire school years and their friends would tell me how great they are. They did that for their mother. \n\nThere is a fine line between mutual respect and being walked all over by your kids.", "If she\u2019s yelling at all of you, she thinks you did wrong and not her.

I don't know If you are paying things for her, if she needs to give money for her rooms or food etc. A lot would stop if some of my kids would talk to me like that.\nFor example: My youngest (Male 11) talked a few weeks ago in an unfriendly way to me. He got forbidden all of his technic stuff to use to think about His behaviour. I know it is normal for kids in this age to act like this, but I don't have to accept this. It is my responsiblity to teach him.\n\nAnd back to your daughter. As I said. I would have gone much earlier. Honestly, I would have taken her phone much earlier. But at least I would have driven after 5 to 10 minutes of waiting.\n\n(I'm sorry for my english. It's not my first language and I am not practising it very often.)", "None of us know what you pay for or what she pays for, but if you still pay for her phone, I'd consider cutting that off immediately.\n\nSeeing as she couldn't seem to get off the call with her friend in time to go with you guys, it seems to me a fitting punishment that she lose her phone until she can learn to be respectful of other people's time. That applies to an iPad or something as well.

I feel bad for her younger sister. \n\nYTA for being so clueless here - it\u2019s infuriating that your sister your wife your other daughter waited on her: she swore at you - and then had the audacity to keep yelling when you returned. \nLike who\u2019s the parent? Who is in control? Cos it ain\u2019t you. \nShe\u2019s done this her whole life for control - and you and your wife have enabled it - she\u2019s 18 and you\u2019re asking Reddit what to do now? \n\nAbsolutely flabbergasted. \nActually through writing this ESH.", "If you had left when you were first ready instead of waiting an hour, you still would have had an hour drive.

Why on earth have you apparently spent years catering to one child and prioritizing that child's laziness over absolutely everyone and everything else? She ignored you? So why didn't you ignore her and just hit the road?", "She probably won't take you seriously. Be prepared to throw her stuff on the curb and to change the locks. She needs to learn.", "[deleted]", "I don't agree with their judgment per se, but here are some things you could improve on:\n\n1. Set a time, identified clearly ahead-of-time, when you would be leaving.\n2. If you give a little leeway (in response to \"almost done\"), make it clear and explicit, e.g. \"We'll wait 10 more minutes, but then we will leave with you or without you.\"\n3. When you do leave, let her know. Texts are free.\n4. Don't exaggerate. If you waited an hour, you missed a quarter of the party due to Carrie's behavior.
