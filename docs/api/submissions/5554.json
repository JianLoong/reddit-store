A few months ago she came back with a kid and told me he\u2019s mine. The dates kind of line up and he does look a little like me so I asked her why she kept him a secret this entire time. Things went from zero to sixty quickly and we got into a huge shouting match. I panicked so I went to see an attorney the next day.\n\nThe attorney advised me not to have any contact with the kid until a paternity test confirms he\u2019s mine. She told me that the state in which we live have very tough laws about presumption of fatherhood and every minute I spend with the kid will make it harder for her to fight against a child support claim. She told me about her first hand experience where a couple of her clients were ordered by the court to pay child support to kids who were proven by DNA tests to not be related because they raised the kids. She didn\u2019t say I would definitely lose but said it will be a tougher and more costly fight. \n\nI went back to my ex and told her I won\u2019t have anything to do with the kid until we get a paternity test. She refused and that should have been the end of that. Instead, she starting to bring the boy around my parents and family. My mother always had a good relationship with the ex so they picked up where they left off. In short order, my parents started to babysit the kid and lately have been calling him their grandson. My entire family have been including him in family events against my wishes.\n\nI\u2019m here now because it\u2019s a family tradition we all gather on the 24th to cook dinner for tonight.

Could you keep your mouth shut in the middle of an argument that you know for sure the child is/isn't yours? How would you explain how you suddenly know?", "And if the mother finds out she can press charges against him. So you are wanting him to risk no one telling the mother the child was tested? That end up saying anything? She'll obviously understand why suddenly op has certain knowledge of the child's paternity.", "We don't know whether or not he's the parent. That's literally the entire point of doing this test.", "That's the thing, if he tries to do that then he could be in the hook for \"assuming parenthood\".", "Considering he didnt know the child existed, how do you assume he has parental rights? He didn't sign a birth certificate or anything and isn't married to the mother.", "Good for you. Op is going by his lawyer's advice which is generally considered the smart way of doing things", "That sounds good until she finds out he did it and is pissed so now he\u2019s in legal trouble for it", "Why is OP saying it's expensive then? And regardless why go through the extra expense at all when the ex could just give her permission for it. Her showing up and saying the kid is his while also refusing permission for a test is incredibly suspect. I do not see how OP is TA for taking some basic precautions here. It's been years after all.", "Fair", "[deleted]", "Why wouldn\u2019t he? It\u2019s not like he\u2019s had that option for all these years", "Except OP is not a legal parent. And has no guardianship. \n\nThis is the legal equivalent of a stranger DNA testing your child.", "Thank you", "It's probably legal to leave a kid with a willing babysitter that isn't blood related.  Calling CPS would be a waste of time for everyone involved.", "Abandonment and neglect... what?", "Other than talking to his family and letting them know that babysitting the child is a bad idea, I honestly don't know. Either way he should let his lawyer know what's happening if he didn't already. It's a super shitty thing for his ex to do.", "Randomly DNA testing people is frowned upon ethically and potentially illegal. Atm the kid is effectively a stranger. So he has zero parental authority to enforce it, hence why it needs to go to the courts to prove he has a case to force it. \n\nIf his parents want to invite some randoms around to be their house and dote on them, that's their choice. Morally they're assholes but likely no laws are being broken. In the West things like grandma/auntie/uncle can kinda act as honorifics.", "It could open OP up for more legal trouble, and there's no guarantee that the family (or ex) won't just accuse OP of lying or bribing a lab. He should go home (if he's still there), request the lawyer start the legal process to petition for a DNA test, and stop contact with his family until it's resolved, as they're firmly on the ex's side and anything he says to them can be used against him when this does inevitably make its way to court", "Yeah, if the family knew, maybe the ex would fuck off.", "He doesn\u2019t need the court to recognize it. He needs to know for himself. If the DNA test says the kid is his, then he can accept the child into his life. If the DNA test says the child isn\u2019t his, he can keep avoiding the kid & keep working on getting the court ordered test.", "No - and I don't blame him. I wouldn't want to needlessly spend thousands of dollars either.", "He can do an at home test. If she left the kid in his parents custody, then he has legal rights. He just has a terrible lawyer", "So admit he\u2019s the parent AND spend direct time with the child? If he does that her lawyers gonna be sending him xmas cards the rest of their life for that coup he gave them in the court room.", "Actually, he can do it, but it\u2019s not admissible in court.", "I don't think it's against the law if it's for private use. It just wouldn't be admissible for custody proceedings. But it could help OP break the tie with whether he should be around the kid. But you're right that OP should run it by his attorney.\n\nEdit: he did and apparently attorney advised against", "If OP isn't willing to fight for DNA test in court (which he COULD do), he needs another plan. This problem isn't going to go away, and will only get worse (the more integrated the boy gets, within the family). \n\nIt's easily possible she's taking OP's family on a ride (which will break their hearts even more, the longer it continues). But even worse, it's damaging a developing child. He will be confused/hurt why his 'Dad' is ignoring him - when his 'Dad's' extended family isn't. And the longer he believes he is a member if the family, the worse the pain if it turns out he isn't. This situation cannot continue indefinitely. It's just going to get more and more complicated, damaging, and awkward. OP needs to establish if he's the father. \n\nIf OP doesn't want to pay to fight in court for a DNA test, he could buy two of those heritage DNA tests (for example). They are cheaper than paternity tests. And they will at least show if there's a first-degree link between him and the boy (so unless the boy's mother slept with OP's brother, that would at least kinda-confirm OP is probably the father). \n\nAgain, there's supposed to be permission from the legal guardian. But they're far less stringent in checking, than private paternity tests. When my mother did one for fun, they didn't require any ID - just signatures. He could even use fake names. It's highly unlikely anyone would find out. Then he at least knows if he's the father - and can base his decisions on that knowledge.", "Long story but since she filed for child support and to get me on the birth certificate the court ordered a DNA test. I wasn't the father obviously and the court dismissed it. Never heard from her again so \ud83e\udd37", "Tell your parents they are forcing you to go no-contact with them, as long as they keep bringing this child who you have good reasons to think is not yours into their life. Document it for the courts. The kid looks like you, but it's entirely possible your ex hooked up with someone who looks like you.\n\nIf you have the money, spend the money.\n\nEdit: yours, not your", "Wow. That is insane. It's absolutely crazy that she can just dump the kid on your parents with the assumption they are grandparents but that you can't get a DNA test. \n\nHonestly, seems like she's lying if she won't submit to it. NTA.", "Yeah, if you did that, you'd have to take the result (and the fact you did it) to the grave. So would only say to do that if you're ok with the ethics of that, and one result would make you go do the formal test and one would inform you it's useless. But you'd have to still act as if the test was never done whichever way it turns out. \n\nIf you're not that hard-headed, well, I wouldn't recommend. Honestly wouldn't recommend it anyway, but it is a personal choice. \n\nIf she's hard to oust from your life, I'd consider biting the bullet on the cost, or see if there is any orgs that can help out with the cost. Because you might end up having to spend money on a restraining order, which may end up with the DNA test anyway... But I'm not a lawyer so you should speak to your actual one about that.", "I didn\u2019t claim to be a lawyer.", "Yea, it might be illegal.  I would argue it would be perfectly moral though.  \n\nI wonder what the consequence would be, or how a \"report\" of it would even be handled? \n\n\"Hey police, umm... this guy, who I claim is the father of my child, had a DNA test done on the child while they were in his families care\" \n\nLike... what's the charge?  I feel like if anything legal happened it might lead to a point where paternity could be legally cleared up.", "If I was a dude, I\u2019d sure as shit do it discreetly just to have some semblance of moving forward. \nIf the test pops hot, start getting the legal ball rolling. \nIf negative, the parents ought to send back the kid and tell mama to kick sand.", "It could be argued he was acting like a father by ordering the test, I guess. She believes it's his right, I assume? \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23", "He's talking about doing it through the courts, with lawyer fees. Nothing prohibits him from taking action and doing it himself. The ex is abandoning the child with his family. OF COURSE he should protect himself but that requires action not inaction. He should not take the lawyers advice. \n1. Lawyer admitted to having a losing record. \n2. Lawyer is going to SAY that s/he saved him thousands bcuz mom doesn't go after the back support and they delayed it to the max length to justify the lawyers fees, which if it is his kid, is stealing from his fam no matter what way you look at it.", "Wtf are you on about? Neither OP nor OPs ex have their race mentioned. You're wack dude. Shows where your brain is.", "What are you talking about? I never mentioned race. I'm just saying, she sounds like the type of person to get pregnant and accuse a random ex of being the father to fuck with his life.", "Dude doesn\u2019t want to even pay for a court ordered paternity test lol. Sorry but no op isn\u2019t going to be dad of the year", "Seriously. CPS is usually overwhelmed.", "fair enough, this seems like such a sticky situation no matter what idea you throw there doesn't seem to be a solution", "bro idk im not a legal advisor im throwing out ideas hoping they stick, thats what happens when you come to reddit", "Ya he needs to put his foot down with his family or stay away from them. They are setting him up to be screwed.", "No, he can't. The mother could press charges if it's done without her consent.", "A negative dna test would prove he wasn\u2019t the parent though? And if he is he should be paying child support.", "He could technically do it, yes. But even discreet DNA tests require consent. And if the mother doesn\u2019t consent, she could get him in trouble.", "The charge would technically be child endangerment I believe. A person without legal authority cannot authorize a medical test on a child. The police would follow the letter of the law, whether they personally agreed with the mother or not.\n\nMorally I do agree Op would be clear. But why would he put himself in that position legally?", "If it was me I'd take the fact that she refuses a paternity test as a pretty big clue I'm not the father. The mother had yet to give a reason why she won't allow a test. I wouldn't spend thousands to confirm it or risk getting myself in legal trouble.", "You can argue anything in court that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s valid\n\nAt the end of the day he is following the advice of his attorney so he\u2019s doing the right thing", "Basically, 2 options:\n1. Get a private DNA test. Pick up for $100 at any store. Pay extra for results. \n2. File ex parte at court, MAX 3 days, & if she doesn't show up and agree to it, u tell the judge she's abandoning the kid at his home. Bada Bing, bada boom. Judgement for paternity granted because the state needs to know if they are on the hook for support or dad is. \nTHE ONLY REASON TO NOT DO IT IS TO DELAY SUPPORT. Which makes it a financial decision.", "So what are you using to judge her ?", "I don't know about crazy or trying to fuck up their life... The most common reasons I've seen for deciding the wrong ex is the father are - real father can't/won't care for child or real father is undesirable in the child's life for some reason (drugs, jail, etc). Nothing to do with race, mental health status, or vendetta against said man. Just desire for help or a daddy for child.\n\nEdit for autocorrect bs", "Oh sonic it\u2019s not race what are you basing all that judgment on ?", "Well if the mother didn\u2019t hide a kid for 5 years they wouldn\u2019t be in this situation in the first place", "You must be a millionaire.\n\nIt cost money to hire an attorney to go to court to argue any case. I\u2019ve been in legal battles before and my attorney wanted a $5,000 retainer each time.", "Based", "No she can't. She said he's the father and she's abandoning the child there.", "I\u2019m just talking Walgreens, over-the-counter test to start, my friend. \n\nI\u2019m just glad I\u2019m not a man. :(", "Everything that was said in post about her ACTIONS numbskull.", "It's just weird. 5 years ago, you broke up with your shitty ex and 5 years later she comes back with a kid saying \"your the father\", you would be suspicious if the kid's actually your son.\n\nAnd if the ex was a good person, as soon as she got pregnant, she would contact you at some point, not 5 years later when the kid's starting school.", "Crazy comes in all races", "Considering how op reacted. Makes sense", "As far as the court is concerned, they share joint legal custody, which allows him to make medical decisions with or without her approval. \nPpl like to say the courts favor mothers without ever actually having been there. Family court was my internship.", "The problem isn't the test - on the internet, 23andmd or whatever. It's of the mother finds out or was fine at all. Personally I don't think I could keep my mouth shut if i knew for sure one way or the other.", "And her actions being ? What exactly", "The \u201cshitty\u201d ex seems to be well liked be all of ops family and it\u2019s pretty darn clear why she didn\u2019t tell op.", "Ok what makes her crazy", "He asked her why she kept it a secret that\u2019s normal considering the circumstances", "Oh, that makes sense. \nI\u2019m just rooting for the best case scenario for the kid. \nI have no idea why a mom would do this to her child. This is like that first season (?) \u201cIt\u2019s\nAlways Sunny\u201d episode.", "Randomly popping up out of the blue after almost 5 years to claim her ex is the father of her child.  Not agreeing to a paternity test. Bringing the kid around her ex's parents to establish a grandparent relationship with them.", "Considering op refuses to even hold the kid. Maybe she didn\u2019t want him involved because you know he very clearly does t want to be involved", "Me too. I'm a firm believer that if a man helps make a child then he is obligated to support that child - physically, emotionally and financially. But a man is not required to just blindly accept that he is a father because some woman says so. Nor should be have to spend thousands or himself in legal jeopardy to prove/disproved the assertion.", "I don\u2019t hold random kids either are you saying that I shouldn\u2019t be a father as well", "Due to his lawyers advice, holding the child, interacting with him could be taken by the courts as accepting a parental role. This means that even if the courts show he isn't the father he could have to pay support. He isn't doing anything but protecting himself until he knows the truth. He explains that several times."]}
