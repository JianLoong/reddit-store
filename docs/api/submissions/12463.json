My about-to-be brother-in-law has a sister who lost her husband 6 months ago and has twin daughters (5). \n\nI offered to watch the twins during the reception so she can hopefully have some fun. I know the twins and they're overall well behave so I seriously didn't mind if that meant BIL\u2019s sister can have some fun after losing her husband and becoming a single mom 6 months ago. \n\nToday I was talking to my sister and I found out my sister told several of her friends I can watch their kids during the reception. I asked why did she say that. She said well since you're a teacher and watching BIL sister\u2019s twins I figured she wouldn't mind. I told her I do mind and she better tells her friends to either take their kids and watch them themselves or start looking for a babysitter because I'm not. \n\nMy sister went all bridezilla and started calling me a selfish AH and accusing me of not liking my job because I can't handle a group of kids for a few hours. It's not that I don't like my job I actually love my job I just rather not watch a group of kids I don't know.

YOu offered to watch only the twins as a favor to a young widow who is related because you were thinking of her and giving her time to have some fun was the reason behind it.

Watching a ton of kids you don't know is another.  I'm certain you firsthand know the difference as a teacher.\n\nYour sister is totally being an AH.
