He loves his steak and bacon and generally isn't too interested in trying vegan options.\n\nHowever, I've been trying to get him to at least consider eating more plant-based meals for the sake of his health. I get worried for him sometimes because he is very fat and his BMI is also quite high. I've been trying to cook healthy meals for him, encouraging him to exercise, and getting creative with the dishes I make, but my partner just doesn't seem interested.\n\nThat's why, last Saturday night, I decided to take matters into my own hands. I made a delicious vegan lasagna for dinner, not mentioning to my partner that it was completely plant-based. To my surprise, my partner loved the lasagna and even asked for seconds. It wasn't until after dinner that I let it slip that the dish was vegan and my partner was less than pleased. I defended my decision by telling them that I've been worried for their health and want them to get skinnier and be better, but my partner said it was very immature of me and I could have talked to him directly.

Eating vegan food won't make him thinner or healthier, necessarily. And you can't trick or force anyone into getting thinner or healthier.

Didn\u2019t he notice you consuming cheese? \n\nAnd, yes Oreos are vegan, but for many people cutting out animal products does force them to focus on using produce to fill themselves up. But you should consider that moderation may be a better solution for him. His solution isn\u2019t your choice. \n\nRegardless, you are approaching this situation all wrong. Focusing on his weight isn\u2019t the place to start. I hope to god you didn\u2019t use the word skinny. This is isn\u2019t about skinny; it\u2019s about getting healthier. To that end, an assessment of his health should come from a medical professional. Then he can set goals. If he chooses to ignore his health risks, that\u2019s a different conversation about committing to a relationship with quality of life for the two of you.", "NTA and for everyone saying she lied, you need reading comprehension.  All she says she did is make a meal and serve it to him.", "Soft YTA in this situation for tricking him, but NTA for cooking and making healthy meals.

Why does \"skinny\" equate to being better? BMI doesn't mean anything. You forcing your vegan lifestyle on him is ridiculous. He is an adult. If he wants to eat differently, he will. If you had simply told him that you were making lasagna the way you wanted and you'd like him to try it if he wants some, that would have been appropriate. Give adults the choice to eat your impossible beef or whatever it is you used. Don't be THAT vegan who gets smug and thinks they're better than everyone else and know better than everyone else.\n\nAnd btw, there are plenty of fat vegans. Oreos are vegan food.

It made me very ill on top of having pulmonary embolisms and pneumonia. I was not thrilled with the person for not telling me it was a vegan burger. To be honest I wondered because it tasted more like soy than meat, like those half soy hamburgers they serve to kids in school. \n\nPlease don't do this. It's your choice to eat vegan. Quit pushing it on your husband. It's not fair and it's not nice, especially to lie to him even if it was by omission. If he chooses to try your vegan meals that's one thing but giving him vegan food on the sly is questionable at best. \n\nYou've just given him a major reason not to trust you. That is just not good for a marriage. Either let him choose or leave him be.", "Just so you know, eating vegan doesn\u2019t always equal to losing weight.

It does not matter whether something is vegan or not, its calories in and calories out. I do not believe the vegan part of the lasagna mattered that much however, trying to force someone to do something without proper knowledge on the topic is not a good choice.\n\n I'd advise to first speak to them about it and bring out what could go badly if they stay the same weight. Then, if you convince them, go to a professional. \n\nBut it is not a good idea to *force* someone in a diet related to weight (without professional help at the very least) as this could cause eating disorders.", "YTA for trying to make him become vegan \u201cfor his health\u201d did you know oreos are vegan?\n\nWhat you did was lie to him by omission, of course he\u2019d be less than pleased.\n\nIf he\u2019s not interested, he\u2019s not interested.

What do you mean by \"be better\"? Ethically? Health-wise? Also, skinnier =/= healthier. Vegan =/= healthier.

That's different than sneaking in extra ingredients when someone has said that they dislike them to trick them into trying it. So the issue was not serving the vegan lasagna, it's your motive of trying to manipulate your partner.", "YTA. Your partner is right - you should've talked to him and communicated like an adult instead of treating him like a child and having to trick him into eating it.", "YTA\n\nFirstly there should\u2019ve been a conversation. Also, the assumption that vegan meals are all healthy is incorrect and could\u2019ve actually been giving him a high calorie meal.

You suck for policing his food intake, equating vegan food with health, and knowingly serving him something you knew he would prefer not to eat if he knew the content.  He sucks for his irrational refusal to eat vegan food and assuming you will cook non-vegan meals for him.  \nSeriously, as someone with food allergies who needs to know what is in the things I eat, I beg you - don't be dishonest with the ingredients you serve.

Maybe he lowers the amount of meat he eats from 7 days a week to 4 days a week. Maybe you go on strolls for dates. Instead of treating him like a child who can\u2019t make decisions for himself you should compromise and slowly start making changes together.

Some meat substitutes are processed foods that I wouldn't touch and to be tricked to eat them is a nasty thing to do.  You're not going to change him at all by tricking him.  He has to decide if he wants to change his diet or not and be healthier.  You can't make him and you can't do it for him.

It's good. If you, the person who made the lasagna, are vegan, would it not stand to reason that if you are eating it, it is vegan as well? What a bizarre thought that the husband would have to assume that his vegan husband would all of a sudden be eating meat and cheese. The only way that OP could be TAH is that he made it about health-- veganism / being plant based isn't necessarily healthier.

He loves his steak and bacon and generally isn't too interested in trying vegan options.\n\nHowever, I've been trying to get him to at least consider eating more plant-based meals for the sake of his health. I get worried for him sometimes because he is very fat and his BMI is also quite high. I've been trying to cook healthy meals for him, encouraging him to exercise, and getting creative with the dishes I make, but my partner just doesn't seem interested.\n\nThat's why, last Saturday night, I decided to take matters into my own hands. I made a delicious vegan lasagna for dinner, not mentioning to my partner that it was completely plant-based. To my surprise, my partner loved the lasagna and even asked for seconds. It wasn't until after dinner that I let it slip that the dish was vegan and my partner was less than pleased. I defended my decision by telling them that I've been worried for their health and want them to get skinnier and be better, but my partner said it was very immature of me and I could have talked to him directly.

If people are curious or open to trying new things, they will. Vegan food isn't just lettuce. I've had and made some damn good lasagna in my time. Dishes I don't eat any longer have become challenges to see if I can make a version I CAN enjoy. I bring my leftovers to work. I post pictures of it. I've had far more people willing to try my meals this way. Just as someone should fuck with your food to make a point, it is a two-way street. Its just a bad look.\n\nAlso, fat vegans exist. Not all vegan food is healthy. Going vegan should be for your own reasons, not because someone tricked you. It won't magically change your blood work, it won't make you suddenly enjoy exercising or working out. It won't suddenly change how you look. If you're concerned with his health (and Jesus, it had better not just be for him to be \"skinnier\") then that's an entirely different convo to have. At the end of the day, it's entirely his choice.
