He loves his steak and bacon and generally isn't too interested in trying vegan options.\n\nHowever, I've been trying to get him to at least consider eating more plant-based meals for the sake of his health. I get worried for him sometimes because he is very fat and his BMI is also quite high. I've been trying to cook healthy meals for him, encouraging him to exercise, and getting creative with the dishes I make, but my partner just doesn't seem interested.\n\nThat's why, last Saturday night, I decided to take matters into my own hands. I made a delicious vegan lasagna for dinner, not mentioning to my partner that it was completely plant-based. To my surprise, my partner loved the lasagna and even asked for seconds. It wasn't until after dinner that I let it slip that the dish was vegan and my partner was less than pleased. I defended my decision by telling them that I've been worried for their health and want them to get skinnier and be better, but my partner said it was very immature of me and I could have talked to him directly.

Eating vegan food won't make him thinner or healthier, necessarily. And you can't trick or force anyone into getting thinner or healthier.

Didn\u2019t he notice you consuming cheese? \n\nAnd, yes Oreos are vegan, but for many people cutting out animal products does force them to focus on using produce to fill themselves up. But you should consider that moderation may be a better solution for him. His solution isn\u2019t your choice. \n\nRegardless, you are approaching this situation all wrong. Focusing on his weight isn\u2019t the place to start. I hope to god you didn\u2019t use the word skinny. This is isn\u2019t about skinny; it\u2019s about getting healthier. To that end, an assessment of his health should come from a medical professional. Then he can set goals.

Why does \"skinny\" equate to being better? BMI doesn't mean anything. You forcing your vegan lifestyle on him is ridiculous. He is an adult. If he wants to eat differently, he will. If you had simply told him that you were making lasagna the way you wanted and you'd like him to try it if he wants some, that would have been appropriate. Give adults the choice to eat your impossible beef or whatever it is you used. Don't be THAT vegan who gets smug and thinks they're better than everyone else and know better than everyone else.\n\nAnd btw, there are plenty of fat vegans. Oreos are vegan food.

It made me very ill on top of having pulmonary embolisms and pneumonia. I was not thrilled with the person for not telling me it was a vegan burger. To be honest I wondered because it tasted more like soy than meat, like those half soy hamburgers they serve to kids in school. \n\nPlease don't do this. It's your choice to eat vegan. Quit pushing it on your husband. It's not fair and it's not nice, especially to lie to him even if it was by omission. If he chooses to try your vegan meals that's one thing but giving him vegan food on the sly is questionable at best. \n\nYou've just given him a major reason not to trust you. That is just not good for a marriage. Either let him choose or leave him be.", "Just so you know, eating vegan doesn\u2019t always equal to losing weight.

It does not matter whether something is vegan or not, its calories in and calories out. I do not believe the vegan part of the lasagna mattered that much however, trying to force someone to do something without proper knowledge on the topic is not a good choice.\n\n I'd advise to first speak to them about it and bring out what could go badly if they stay the same weight. Then, if you convince them, go to a professional. \n\nBut it is not a good idea to *force* someone in a diet related to weight (without professional help at the very least) as this could cause eating disorders.", "YTA for trying to make him become vegan \u201cfor his health\u201d did you know oreos are vegan?\n\nWhat you did was lie to him by omission, of course he\u2019d be less than pleased.\n\nIf he\u2019s not interested, he\u2019s not interested.

What do you mean by \"be better\"? Ethically? Health-wise? Also, skinnier =/= healthier. Vegan =/= healthier.

Doesn't matter that it was fine and allergen free, you took away his agency to make decisions for himself.\n\nAs a side note you need to stop bowing to his demands. If he wants steak and potatoes he can cook them himself.", "these comments are wild. it is not \"food tampering\" to make a vegan meal, nor is it tricking anyone. you simply did not use animal products. it would be a different story if your partner had allergies to commonly used vegan replacements (cashews, soy, etc.) but as it stands no, you are NTA for simply making a meal without meat or dairy, that's as benign as it gets. \n\nas for what your concerns are - BMI is not always an indicator of good health, but if your partner does not exercise and eats a lot of steak and bacon yeah you're probably right to be concerned. however, it is his life and you cannot force him to make lifestyle changes, nor can you force your lifestyle on him. you continue cooking the healthy foods you want, and if he hates vegetables so much he can make his own meat and potatoes.", "It would mainly be E S H, but more YTA for lying.\n\nPlaying passive aggressive games is dumb, especially when you are using weight and body shaming towards him.

That's different than sneaking in extra ingredients when someone has said that they dislike them to trick them into trying it. So the issue was not serving the vegan lasagna, it's your motive of trying to manipulate your partner.", "YTA. Your partner is right - you should've talked to him and communicated like an adult instead of treating him like a child and having to trick him into eating it.", "YTA\n\nFirstly there should\u2019ve been a conversation. Also, the assumption that vegan meals are all healthy is incorrect and could\u2019ve actually been giving him a high calorie meal. Him getting healthy isn\u2019t about converting him to your way of eating. The way you describe your partner leave a lot to be desired.", "YTA- your defense is where you lost.

You suck for policing his food intake, equating vegan food with health, and knowingly serving him something you knew he would prefer not to eat if he knew the content.  He sucks for his irrational refusal to eat vegan food and assuming you will cook non-vegan meals for him.  \nSeriously, as someone with food allergies who needs to know what is in the things I eat, I beg you - don't be dishonest with the ingredients you serve.

Maybe he lowers the amount of meat he eats from 7 days a week to 4 days a week. Maybe you go on strolls for dates. Instead of treating him like a child who can\u2019t make decisions for himself you should compromise and slowly start making changes together.

Some meat substitutes are processed foods that I wouldn't touch and to be tricked to eat them is a nasty thing to do.  You're not going to change him at all by tricking him.  He has to decide if he wants to change his diet or not and be healthier.  You can't make him and you can't do it for him.

It's good. If you, the person who made the lasagna, are vegan, would it not stand to reason that if you are eating it, it is vegan as well? What a bizarre thought that the husband would have to assume that his vegan husband would all of a sudden be eating meat and cheese. The only way that OP could be TAH is that he made it about health-- veganism / being plant based isn't necessarily healthier.

He loves his steak and bacon and generally isn't too interested in trying vegan options.\n\nHowever, I've been trying to get him to at least consider eating more plant-based meals for the sake of his health. I get worried for him sometimes because he is very fat and his BMI is also quite high. I've been trying to cook healthy meals for him, encouraging him to exercise, and getting creative with the dishes I make, but my partner just doesn't seem interested.\n\nThat's why, last Saturday night, I decided to take matters into my own hands. I made a delicious vegan lasagna for dinner, not mentioning to my partner that it was completely plant-based. To my surprise, my partner loved the lasagna and even asked for seconds. It wasn't until after dinner that I let it slip that the dish was vegan and my partner was less than pleased. I defended my decision by telling them that I've been worried for their health and want them to get skinnier and be better, but my partner said it was very immature of me and I could have talked to him directly.

If people are curious or open to trying new things, they will. Vegan food isn't just lettuce. I've had and made some damn good lasagna in my time. Dishes I don't eat any longer have become challenges to see if I can make a version I CAN enjoy. I bring my leftovers to work. I post pictures of it. I've had far more people willing to try my meals this way. Just as someone should fuck with your food to make a point, it is a two-way street. Its just a bad look.\n\nAlso, fat vegans exist. Not all vegan food is healthy. Going vegan should be for your own reasons, not because someone tricked you. It won't magically change your blood work, it won't make you suddenly enjoy exercising or working out. It won't suddenly change how you look. If you're concerned with his health (and Jesus, it had better not just be for him to be \"skinnier\") then that's an entirely different convo to have. At the end of the day, it's entirely his choice.

All I read is that OP said their partner is uninterested and then felt tricked by OP feeding them lasagna that was vegan.  Where is the partner\u2019s own responsibility to ask whats in the food?  \n\nIf I talked about my meals being vegan or plant based the first thing my husband said was he feels like a burger or steak.  I learned to just stfu about what I was cooking.  According to most of the people in this comment section that makes me an evil deceiver.  \n\nNow? Last Thursday he brought home kidney beans to make cajun bean burgers and he wants to bring jackfruit bbq tacos to his blue collar job.  We have banana blossoms and kombu because he wants to know if it will really taste like fried fish.   He is excited to try new food when if I brought it up a year ago he\u2019d go on a straight carnivore binge at the suggestion of a plant based diet.   We went back and forth over it with him talking about \u201ccomplete proteins\u201d and \u201cheme iron\u201d and me talking about \u201cfiber\u201d and \u201cnutrient dense.\u201d \nHe showed me FAT HEAD and went on about the \u201ccaveman diet\u201d so I had him listen to the Audiobook \u201cHOW NOT TO DIE\u201d as well as discussed how nutritionally rich and high in fiber most modern hunter gatherer cultures are.   \n\nHe only brought it up if I brought it up first.  So I just learned to stop talking about it. Or \u201clying by omission\u201d \n\nI was excited to try new recipes and learn to like vegetables. My family has diet related health problems. We\u2019re all over weight and my whole life vegetables were canned corn, canned green beans, canned peas, or like baby carrots in a potroast.  I had genuinely never eaten a vegetable by itself unless you count a french fry. \nI was excited and I wanted to share that excitement with him. Unfortunately everything I said just made him double down. Which to me was so stupid because he liked vegetables I\u2019d never even seen in real life. He LOVES Brussels sprouts, okra, daikon radish, etc but my talking about wanting to try plant based dishes pushed him to crave nothing but burgers, steak, and creamy pastas.  \n\nI just made what I wanted to make and he ate what I made.  So long as I didn\u2019t talk about it being plant based it was never an issue and now it\u2019s so normal he\u2019s even more excited to try new things than I am.", "Yeah that makes sense. So my mom is vegan and whenever she makes a side for like a potluck I've told her to not make a big deal about it being vegan. Because she always goes on about it and doesn't realize how much she is annoying people lol. But mostly because if people know they literally won't even try it! I've become way more cautious about allergens recently though because of a new family member with a soy/legumes allergy. I'm starting to think the best way to do it is announce possible allergens and ingredients without actually saying \"vegan\"", "Of course it's true. It just happens to be a really big cell. Unless it's fertilized, of course. Then it becomes lots of cells very quickly.", "YTA for policing his diet and weight. It's really disrespectful to conceal the ingredients in the meal, especially because the intention behind it comes from you wanting to force him to make changes that he has already explicitly told you he isn't interested in.\n\nYou can't force people to make changes. You can encourage them, you can support them, you can give them information, but at the end of the day THEY have to be the one to make those changes, period. Trying to force this on your husband is going to make him feel defensive and judged by you. He is going to feel hurt and pushed away, not loved. I say this because my partner went through a phase where he started to be very controlling about my food and body due to his own unfounded anxiety about my health. I had to tell him not to talk to me about it anymore because it was triggering deep insecurities and anxieties for me and reinforcing the disordered eating habits that I already struggle to keep at bay. I already have a healthy diet, and my doctor has no concerns for my health. The only change I want to make is to start exercising more frequently again, which is a change I already wanted to make independently from my partner. I have been struggling with anxiety and depression, and that can make it really difficult to stay on top of a healthy lifestyle. Does your husband have any mental health issues? Because if you're more focused on what you perceive to be his biggest problem, instead of supporting him with the things he is genuinely struggling with, that is the opposite of helping. \n\nYou need to look at this from a place of love and compassion, not fear. And I really encourage you to unpack these feelings with a therapist, because it sounds like you need to get a better understanding of why you feel a need to trick your husband and why you feel a need to continue to push him about this.\n\nAlso, the BMI index is extremely outdated and statistically unsound.
