The bride lives about 2 hours away and the other 2 live by me (we were all college roommates), but we all talk every single day in multiple group chats on multiple different apps. \n\nToday I got a Snapchat from the bride to our group chat and it\u2019s a video of her fianc\u00e9 but in the back I hear my friend who lives in my area talking which I thought was weird. I asked the bride in our group chat if they were all together and she simply replied yes and when I asked where was my invite she said she came down here to get Botox and that was all she said which is like ok but you came with your fianc\u00e9 and you\u2019re all out at the bar drinking? And even weirder the friend who was in the background of the video called me to chit chat this morning for over 30 min and didn\u2019t mention a thing. She claims she ran into them on the street which I highly doubt, but also thought I had other plans, which I didn\u2019t, so they didn\u2019t say anything to me. I told her in a separate text that it hurt me that they didn\u2019t include me and she just again said she thought I had other plans which again we never spoke about. If my friend told me that I hurt them I would at least apologize for hurting their feelings. \n\nAITA??? I feel like it\u2019s intentional to somehow not mention you\u2019re coming to my town from 2 hours away and hanging out with our other 2 friends but not me even though we are ALL in your wedding next week and have been friends for the same amount of time. It makes me feel weird to even go to the wedding now like this is very weird mean girl behavior in my opinion, but am I overreacting and being an asshole? Who wants to be left out like that especially after spending SO much time and money on one of their weddings??", "created_utc": 1698572113, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17izdo7/aita_for_being_upset_that_my_friends_hung_out/", "score": 96, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

This definitely looks like a \"freeze out\" which is usually intentional,  coordinated and pretty nasty", "NTA. While I think that it is okay for friends within a larger friend group to do things independently from the whole group, this feels a little different from that.

If you still genuinely feel like you are being frozen out of the friends group, stuff your face on her dime and then wave goodbye to the lot of them at the end of the day. \n\nDon't make her wedding day about you. Just observe and make mental notes and act accordingly after the event.\n\nYou've only got the next week to get through!", "NTA, I feel like the pettiness in me would go on a mini vacation a day before the wedding and simply not show up. When asked why, I would say I went to get Botox and it just didn\u2019t come up", "NTA\n\nIs it something that regularly happens, that you feel ignored/ excluded?\nI\u2019d also recommend that you wait until after the wedding to bring it up. And maybe separately with your friends. It sucks to be excluded and fed obvious excuses.", "Info: are there other bridesmaids in your town who were also not invited? It\u2019s totally okay for her to just want to see your other friend but if it was just you excluded I completely understand the hurt.", "ESH\n\nLook, it's hurtful. I get that. But you have no proof that they're not telling the truth about it being a fluke. And frankly, you're not entitled to always being invited to everything they do together. It does sound shady, and you're entitled to communicate that and maybe reconsider the friendships, but the world also doesn't revolve around you.", "Weird shit like this happens often when it comes to weddings. There is so much going on at different levels someone if not many are bound to feel left out. Perhaps it was a fluke that they all happened to meet up. With all that\u2019s going on everyone is in it for themselves. Remember this is not about you, it\u2019s about your friends wedding and it\u2019s her big day. As her best friend and being one of the bridesmaids, you kind of have an obligation that you agreed to. If anything, hold up your commitment. I imagine what your feeling isn\u2019t pleasant but don\u2019t let this have that big of an affect you even though it feels like it. If you can, let her enjoy her day and do your best to enjoy it too. You can\u2019t jump to conclusions and whatever is occurring that seems off can and should wait until after the wedding. You all are still speaking so their not blocking you out of the picture. The other girls may have wanted the bride to themselves. There\u2019s nothing wrong with that.

It's a week til the wedding, don't create drama where there doesn't need to be drama. If they were going behind your back and deliberately excluding you, the bride wouldn't have put that video on Snapchat.", "Either E S H or N A H. Look, even in close friend groups not very one has to hang out together at the same time. I\u2019m in a very tight knit group with the daily chat, regular hang outs, etc. as well. However, this does not mean when people want to hang it that it has to be all or nothing. The whole group doesn\u2019t need to be involved every time. They aren\u2019t AH\u2019s just for hanging out without you, and you\u2019re not an AH for being hurt. However, what\u2019s tipping this into AH territory for me is the friends not being upfront when you said your feelings were hurt. A simple sorry would\u2019ve been appropriate. For you, the making the friendship transactional and being hung up on the wedding costs does seem a bit petty.  You agreed to spend that cash to be in this wedding presumably because you value this friendship and supporting her. You could\u2019ve easily turned it down if the money was too much or not worth it to you. It\u2019s suddenly an issue now though when you didn\u2019t get your way. That money is for the wedding- not this hang out- and does not entitle you to be at every hang. Do you and the other two ever hang out without the bride? Either of you three locals hang out 1:1 without the other?", "NTA \n\nI\u2019m leaning towards it\u2019s something rude on their part, but to throw out alternate possibilities as you\u2019ve been friends for a long time: is there any topic that they all have in common that you don\u2019t or is sensitive for you? \n\nIf knew I was about to see a friend who doesn\u2019t drink next week but I was going for drinks, I could imagine counting them out of a quick invite. Or for example, you\u2019re grieving a parent but the bride wanted to complain about hers to a certain friend. This is the only way I can imagine it not being rudely motivated, and even then I would have apologized way more sincerely if the person being left out found out.", "NTA the fact that you have a very active group chat and she came from so far would have made it easy to include everyone in setting up drinks/catch up all together. \n\nIt does seem that you have been excluded on purpose. There may be a good reason, but in that case I would have given you a heads up \u201chey, I\u2019m catching up 1-1 with X because need to talk about \u2026. Whatever reason etc\u201d.\n\nAlso if they indeed bumped into each other by chance, it takes 1 min to include you and offer to join them.", "Your friends are entitled to meet without letting you know, but if you think they did it on purpose to hurt you, and now you won't feel comfortable at the wedding, don't start drama or anything. There's no point. Just don't show up.\n\nWhat are you going to do? Fight with the bride and the other bridesmaids a few days before the wedding? If you accuse them of leaving you out, things won't end well. You'll end up being the jealous friend trying to ruin the bride's big day. \n\nThere's not much you can do. \n\n1) Suck it up, forget about it and have fun at the wedding, And never bring up the subject ever.\n2) Start drama before the wedding, fight with your friends and probably get uninvited.\n3) if you're positive they did it to hurt you, they're not your friends. Go and have fun anyway at their expense or just don't show up.\n\nWere there any red flags you've been ignoring? Because you just don't wake up one day thinking someone did something knowing you'll find out and feel hurt. \n\nOn the other hand, it's a bit weird that if you chat everyday with the bride and the other bridesmaids, they all made plans excluding you, but then made sure you found out they were having fun. Like I said before, they're entitled to go out without telling you, but something feels off. Of course they knew you wouldn't be happy about it. Even if they \"thought\" you had other plans, they could have asked. They just decided for you. \n\nIf I found myself in your situation, I just wouldn't bring up the subject, play dumb if they do, and wouldn't show up to the wedding. Then turn on \"Do not disturb\" feature in my phone and enjoy my day. There's no point in showing up and feeling uncomfortable. You're entitled to make your own plans too and don't include them.\n\nI don't know if there's much you can do with your friend's wedding so close that won't cause drama. They already told you they thought you were busy. Pushing the subject a few days before your friend's big day, may have unwanted side effects.\n\nDo what you feel it's best for you. Good luck!", "Takes all of two seconds to ask someone to join for drinks.\n\nIt was intentional.\n\nDoesn't sound like best friend behaviour to me, you say she is your best friend but are you hers?  How often do you actually hang out together, if it isn't often that makes the situation even worse.\n\nAlso why are you spending $2000 on *her* wedding? That's not normal. \n\nCould be completely wrong but from the limited info sounds like you're a friend to be used, not one that is wanted.\n\nNTA.", "Yta the world does not  revolve around you.  Your friends can get together without you.  They have no obligation to include you in everything they do. Get over yourself.  You are so entitled, self centered and immature it is rediculous. With your me me me attitude they probably just wanted a break from you. Wow. Amazing conceit. You sound like a bullying 10 year old.", "if it makes you feel any better, your bride friend is not going to look good in her wedding day. Getting Botox 7 days before your wedding is probably the dumbest thing she could\u2019ve done. Her face will be stiff and it won\u2019t be settled into her skin by then lmaoooo. Karmas a bitch and it happened as soon as your friends ditched!", "I tell my daughters to be thankful and hopeful for not being asked to be a bridesmaid it seems the expenses are extravagant", "NTA for being upset but really and truly mistakes and miscommunication happen. \n\nAre you sure you didn\u2019t miss a ping on one of the other apps you use? Had you posted any other snap/tweet/etc leading them to believe you were busy? Your friend was in town for Botox\u2026could it be she wasn\u2019t sure how she would react to the procedure so she told no one? And/or only confided with one of the others because they had done it before? \n\nAnd lastly? Weddings are stressful for everyone. But if you feel this is the last straw after various other hurts? After the wedding, reevaluate your friend group. But do go to the wedding. You\u2019ve invested a lot, it will be a party. If it\u2019s the last time you\u2019ll all be together might as well have cake and spirits and some dancing.", "NTA\n\nDo the minimum for the wedding. Put on a pleasant face. And then reevaluate.
