The bride lives about 2 hours away and the other 2 live by me (we were all college roommates), but we all talk every single day in multiple group chats on multiple different apps. \n\nToday I got a Snapchat from the bride to our group chat and it\u2019s a video of her fianc\u00e9 but in the back I hear my friend who lives in my area talking which I thought was weird. I asked the bride in our group chat if they were all together and she simply replied yes and when I asked where was my invite she said she came down here to get Botox and that was all she said which is like ok but you came with your fianc\u00e9 and you\u2019re all out at the bar drinking? And even weirder the friend who was in the background of the video called me to chit chat this morning for over 30 min and didn\u2019t mention a thing. She claims she ran into them on the street which I highly doubt, but also thought I had other plans, which I didn\u2019t, so they didn\u2019t say anything to me. I told her in a separate text that it hurt me that they didn\u2019t include me and she just again said she thought I had other plans which again we never spoke about. If my friend told me that I hurt them I would at least apologize for hurting their feelings. \n\nAITA??? I feel like it\u2019s intentional to somehow not mention you\u2019re coming to my town from 2 hours away and hanging out with our other 2 friends but not me even though we are ALL in your wedding next week and have been friends for the same amount of time.

There is so much going on at different levels someone if not many are bound to feel left out. Perhaps it was a fluke that they all happened to meet up. With all that\u2019s going on everyone is in it for themselves. Remember this is not about you, it\u2019s about your friends wedding and it\u2019s her big day. As her best friend and being one of the bridesmaids, you kind of have an obligation that you agreed to. If anything, hold up your commitment. I imagine what your feeling isn\u2019t pleasant but don\u2019t let this have that big of an affect you even though it feels like it. If you can, let her enjoy her day and do your best to enjoy it too. You can\u2019t jump to conclusions and whatever is occurring that seems off can and should wait until after the wedding.

Look, even in close friend groups not very one has to hang out together at the same time. I\u2019m in a very tight knit group with the daily chat, regular hang outs, etc. as well. However, this does not mean when people want to hang it that it has to be all or nothing. The whole group doesn\u2019t need to be involved every time. They aren\u2019t AH\u2019s just for hanging out without you, and you\u2019re not an AH for being hurt. However, what\u2019s tipping this into AH territory for me is the friends not being upfront when you said your feelings were hurt. A simple sorry would\u2019ve been appropriate. For you, the making the friendship transactional and being hung up on the wedding costs does seem a bit petty.  You agreed to spend that cash to be in this wedding presumably because you value this friendship and supporting her. You could\u2019ve easily turned it down if the money was too much or not worth it to you. It\u2019s suddenly an issue now though when you didn\u2019t get your way.

This is the only way I can imagine it not being rudely motivated, and even then I would have apologized way more sincerely if the person being left out found out.", "NTA the fact that you have a very active group chat and she came from so far would have made it easy to include everyone in setting up drinks/catch up all together. \n\nIt does seem that you have been excluded on purpose. There may be a good reason, but in that case I would have given you a heads up \u201chey, I\u2019m catching up 1-1 with X because need to talk about \u2026. Whatever reason etc\u201d.\n\nAlso if they indeed bumped into each other by chance, it takes 1 min to include you and offer to join them.", "Your friends are entitled to meet without letting you know, but if you think they did it on purpose to hurt you, and now you won't feel comfortable at the wedding, don't start drama or anything. There's no point. Just don't show up.\n\nWhat are you going to do? Fight with the bride and the other bridesmaids a few days before the wedding? If you accuse them of leaving you out, things won't end well. You'll end up being the jealous friend trying to ruin the bride's big day. \n\nThere's not much you can do. \n\n1) Suck it up, forget about it and have fun at the wedding, And never bring up the subject ever.\n2) Start drama before the wedding, fight with your friends and probably get uninvited.\n3) if you're positive they did it to hurt you, they're not your friends. Go and have fun anyway at their expense or just don't show up.\n\nWere there any red flags you've been ignoring? Because you just don't wake up one day thinking someone did something knowing you'll find out and feel hurt. \n\nOn the other hand, it's a bit weird that if you chat everyday with the bride and the other bridesmaids, they all made plans excluding you, but then made sure you found out they were having fun. Like I said before, they're entitled to go out without telling you, but something feels off. Of course they knew you wouldn't be happy about it. Even if they \"thought\" you had other plans, they could have asked. They just decided for you. \n\nIf I found myself in your situation, I just wouldn't bring up the subject, play dumb if they do, and wouldn't show up to the wedding. Then turn on \"Do not disturb\" feature in my phone and enjoy my day. There's no point in showing up and feeling uncomfortable. You're entitled to make your own plans too and don't include them.\n\nI don't know if there's much you can do with your friend's wedding so close that won't cause drama.

You sound like a bullying 10 year old.", "if it makes you feel any better, your bride friend is not going to look good in her wedding day. Getting Botox 7 days before your wedding is probably the dumbest thing she could\u2019ve done. Her face will be stiff and it won\u2019t be settled into her skin by then lmaoooo.

And/or only confided with one of the others because they had done it before? \n\nAnd lastly? Weddings are stressful for everyone. But if you feel this is the last straw after various other hurts? After the wedding, reevaluate your friend group. But do go to the wedding. You\u2019ve invested a lot, it will be a party.

In this example, the wrong probability is \"what is the chance that if my friend group was trying to cut me out, that they'd all meet up without me and send a Snapchat about it?\" and the answer to that question is \"very high\" so turn the conclusion we draw is \"my friend group is trying to cut me out.\"\n\nBut that's the wrong question to ask. The question you should ask is \"what is the probability that the reason my friends met up without me one night is because they are trying to cut me out?\" and that's a much lower probability- now you have to weigh the option of them cutting you out vs every other option out there. They weren't planning on all meeting up, but happened to run into each other. They were doing something they didn't think you'd enjoy. The bride was busy and honestly just forgot and is now embarrassed she forgot. The list goes on.

You're not an AH for feeling upset, but you could become one if you just didn't show up to the wedding, or showed up with a bad attitude. And they aren't the AH yet, but could easily become one if they keep excluding you. But don't let it fester.

If they had meet by accident then everyone would have mentioned it when they each talked to her. There would have been no way not one of them would have said unless it was made clear not to let her know as she wasn\u2019t welcome. This is why I have other women friends but avoid groups of women. There is always some drama and some bitchy ness and often they expect everyone to take sides even when the victims not done anything or is even aware of the situation.   \nI\u2018ve even been the one who was excluded even turned up to the wedding having been told it\u2019s small and all of us have only been invited to the evening service I\u2019m mean this was the info even during the hen night. To then discover once I\u2019ve travelled and got to the hotel and trying to meet up with everyone to get ready like was agreed. To discover they are all ignoring me and no where to be found, just for someone else to drop the bomb. They are at the main ceremony that is large and I\u2019m there by myself the only one excluded and given false plans. They had formed a separate wedding group chat to arrange things to deliberately exclude me.   \nI had never even had an argument with any of them nor the bride. At her hen night she had talked about excluding one of the other girls to the evening ceremony we were all only going to. I had advised her if she couldn\u2019t afford them there and wasn\u2019t close to them then tell them upfront so they aren\u2019t hurt and know the reasons why and they can discuss it. Others all said the same so it wasn\u2019t only me. No she not only kept that person invited but she upped them and the whole group but me to everything which was clear wasn\u2019t about money or being able to afford it.   \nI was crushed just destroyed not only at her betrayal and actions but that everyone of the my friends in the group were involved they all betrayed me and saw no wrong in doing so. They laid down false plans and had been excluding me for months without me knowing. So I went home in tears instead of staying and having to act friendly and happy with people who had just broken my heart in a very public wedding setting. Of course I was bombarded with texts at how stupid I\u2019m being and just have to deal with it and suck it up and come to the reception . Last year 5 years later was the first time one of the group my so called friends tried to contact me since. Asking if I stopped contacting them because of what happened at the wedding and said they felt bad.

It\u2019s totally plausible.

I feel like it\u2019s intentional to somehow not mention you\u2019re coming to my town from 2 hours away and hanging out with our other 2 friends but not me even though we are ALL in your wedding next week and have been friends for the same amount of time.\"\n\nMaybe I'm wrong, but I understand she was the only one excluded.\n\nI agree that it's ok for friends to hang out separately. What I don't understand is why OP feels they excluded her on purpose and won't believe them. Like you said, why is she doubting them?", "Yeah but games like this are why you can\u2019t trust people like this. If someone did this to me it would make me question everything. Lying by omission is a shitty thing to do and it erodes relationships. Maybe it was just this once, but maybe they do this all the time and OP just doesn\u2019t know about it because they keep that info from her. Just not cool.

What made it worse was when our other friends saw the pictures and asked them why I wasn\u2019t invited when I lived the closest. I didn\u2019t say anything, but the friend that hosted came up to me and gave me a BS excuse as to why I wasn\u2019t invited.

I'm attempting to be generous and suggest that, perhaps, pre-wedding chaos, demands on her time, etc. made OP's 'friend' act and say something thoughtless.

In circumstances like this, I can see a person's fornication farm locust ravaged and, lo, bereft of even a suggestion of a desultory fisting to offer anyone who had more criticisms, suggestions, or emotional blackmail. \n\nThat, or the bride is a toxic, selfish, deliberately hurtful person.

My first marriage had uneven sides and I...was aware of it on the day, but luckily, my OCD mild enough that on the day, I could be easily enough distracted from it. We didn't have a photographer and it might be for the best because I'm not sure that it's mild enough that I could've displayed photos with uneven sides. And that's wild to me because, logically, I know it doesn't matter; the uneven number has no bearing on anything of consequence. And yet, I'm anxious just thinking about having to look at hypothetical photos. OCD is dumb lol"]}
