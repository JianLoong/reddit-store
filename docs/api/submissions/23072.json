You can be done with the relationship.

No sane person who wants to remain in a relationship would do that. That was highly immature and possibly manipulative. If you wanted to stay with her then that's not what you should have done. She was right to dump you. Honestly she probably assumed that's what you wanted to do too! She isn't a mind reader.", "EHS. She shouldn't have tricked you (if that's actually what happened), but you also overreacted. Sounds like she needs someone more laid back than you.", "INFO\n\nDid your girlfriend talked to you about wanting to see Barbie?\n\nEither ways your girlfriend dumped you over holding a grudge for four days and not communicating, not for leaving her at the theatre. \n\nDo better next time kid.", "ESH you aren't ready for a relationship together. Both were wrong and you need to learn to communicate better about these things.", "ESH. \n\nShe pulled a Dick move, so clearly she is the AH. \n\nEverything about your actions after learning about the movie switch suggests you decided this would be a perfectly fine hill to die on. Which is fine. Wouldn\u2019t have blamed you for ending it over her behavior. But now you are shocked, SHOCKED to find your relationship dead on this hill. Really?", "\nIm not saying your actions were wrong. She took your money and bought movie tickets to a film other than the discussed. You are a young person struggling with money. You can't piss away money like that. It's OK to break up with her for her actions.\n\nThats what surely what you wanted though?\n\nLeaving her and doing a 4 day silent treatment was you breaking up with her for her bad behaviour.\n\nOK she might have actually been the only one to say \"we are broken up\" but that's the logical response to your actions", "NTA.\n\nI assume it would have been impossible to change into a screening of Oppenheimer with the same experience right on the spot. \n\nFrankly I think you lacked some communication yourself \u2014 you should have had a discussion with her, expressed your frustration, explained that you were going home and you didn\u2019t appreciate the \u201cjoke,\u201d even if you could change the tickets to \u201cfix it.\u201d\n\nBut the fact that this little \u201cjoke\u201d meant you didn\u2019t talk for 4 days tells me this relationship wasn\u2019t suitable or mature enough and not a good fit.\n\nBarbie was a good movie (seen both) but I get working hard for money and being really disappointed to have an evening ruined over a stupid joke.", "ESH\n\nHow were you surprised that your relationship was over...? What she did was obviously not okay but I think walking out on her and not talking for days was a massive overreaction. If you truly wanted to make up leaving like that and not talking to her for days (she was the one who called you) just cemented your breakup.\n\nI think it's honestly better you two are apart.", "Esh. Clearly she shouldn't have done that. That sort of fun would have been fine with some people but obviously not you, maybe she should have known that.\n\nBut dont just abandon a woman somewhere without a ride home. And not checking in for 4 days? Shes 100% right to want to take a break.", "ESH\n\nShe sucks for spending your money on something other than what you agreed on, especially so if we assume she knows how hard your money situation is.\n\nYou suck for walking out and leaving her there without a planned way home, and then apparently ignoring her for four days.\n\nYou both either need to really work on communication and making sure you both understand what is important to both of you, or you move on your separate ways.", "ESH. However, you are way too up tight. Learn to relax, go with the flow and live a little. This could have easily been turned around but you chose to be a prick and abandon her there over a harmless joke between you two. You\u2019ve got a lot of growing up to do.", "ESH. I thought about it for awhile, and that\u2019s my end vote. She shouldn\u2019t have bought the barbie tickets without warning you, but ditching her at the theater (yes she could get an uber home but it\u2019s riskier to accept uber or other driver services as a woman than as a man) and ghosting her for 4 days over this was also not a good thing to do.\n\nBut you\u2019re both young and a lot of people are idiots at your ages so I honestly don\u2019t judge either of you that badly here. I know I did plenty of stupid/childish things like this before I turned 23 but in the end I matured. You two will as well.", "ESH and maybe just stay broken up if you are going to break up over something so childish haha", "ESH.  You two obviously have communication issues and are both acting like children.  And you were both wrong.  She shouldn\u2019t have pulled the switch (it\u2019s irrelevant that Barbie is considered a good movie, switching without discussing was wrong).  You shouldn\u2019t have stranded her there.  And apparently didn\u2019t care enough to make sure she got home okay.  That was definitely an AH move.\n\nYou both need to grow up before you torpedo your next relationships.  This one is likely done.", "I understand you, I would have been annoyed too. But here\u2019s when you talk it out like adults. Maybe reach a compromise. Maybe she could have taken you to see Oppenheimer next and it would have been her treat? It sounds like a prank gone wrong honestly, and then you escalated it. \n\nYou don\u2019t leave in a huff, sulk for four days and then expect to still be in a relationship. \n\nESH.", "YTA\n\nOppenheimer vs Barbie. So hot for rage-bait right now.", "ESH\n\nYou\u2019re both too immature to be dating", "Nah NTA she agreed, snuck around and didn\u2019t do what you agreed to do, then giggled? That shows no respect for you in my opinion.\nI\u2019m a girl, I would\u2019ve done the same thing(left) And for the people saying Oppenheimer isn\u2019t going anywhere, neither is Barbie.", "INFO Did you confirm before you walked out of the theater that your GF bought the wrong tickets? And that she did it on purpose? Laughing might just mean she found someone else's mistake funny.", "N T A for walking out, but you didn't communicate with her afterwards (it took HER 20mins to call me). Why didn't you let her know you were very unhappy with what she did and you would give her a ride home here and now bc you are leaving. If she wants to finish the movie thats fine, but then you can't give her a ride anymore. \n\nAnd then talk it out afterwards.\n\nI'm a little surprised you expected to still be in a relationship with her when you did such a bad job ckmmunicating. \n\nI know you are young. But you learnt a valuable lesson here. She was your gf, not your mom or your wife. You may expected you will just talk out whatever happens in your RS, but in the early gf/bf stage a lot of ppl don't \"waste\" their time dealing with stuff like bad communication.", "Gonna say ESH. \n\nBecause she used your money to buy the tickets I think it\u2019s very obvious that she probably did want to see the movie and it\u2019s not just a joke, that\u2019s your money used to go see something you won\u2019t enjoy, she needs to understand that and how much of a waste it actually is and how used you feel because of it and how excited you were to see the other movie. If you communicated that instead of ghosting each other it might have went better. Shouldn\u2019t you be calling her to make sure she got home okay too? Arguments happen but this definitely went further than it should have. \n\nBut you are the AH too because you just left her there to get home alone I imagine she isn\u2019t that much better off than you when it comes to money might have been hard to get home. Still the gf took no responsibility for what she did. \n\nAlso just want to say for others not everyone wants to watch the barbie movie and I find it hilarious that it\u2019s causing so many problems for people, how can you get mad that someone doesn\u2019t want to watch the barbie movie with you not everyone likes it.", "ESH but you\u2019re the bigger asshole IMO. What she did wasn\u2019t cool but the way you handled it was terrible. Changing the circumstances off your night out (which movie you were seeing) without telling you is a world apart from completely nuking the evening.", "**INFO**\n\nI understand that money is tight for you. When you and your GF do things together, how often are you doing things that your girlfriend wants to do?", "YTA. She tested a $20 prank and it failed. If you were an adult, you would have communicated with her *right there* that you were upset with her and asked her to pay you back or buy the tickets to actually see Oppenheimer with her own money. \n\nBut instead you abandoned her and ghosted her for four days??? Yeah you can\u2019t do that in an adult relationship and expect it to work out. I think most people would dump a partner over four days of ghosting instead of talking a problem out. You should learn a lesson in communication from this.", "ESH, if you wanted to stay in the relationship you should have stayed and then had it out with her when you got home or on the way home. She's wrong for spending your money like that, you're wrong for abandoning her and expecting her to stay with you. \n\nIt's fine that you left her there btw, not fine that you expected to stay together.", "YTA mainly because you were shocked that after leaving her at the theater and not speaking for her for 4 days that she\u2019d want to end the relationship. Yes, it\u2019s annoying that she seemingly booked a different movie. But did she pay for the tickets or did you? Did you even check that the person sent you to the right theater? All you had to do was say \u201cI can\u2019t afford to see more than one movie this month and I picked a different one\u201d and then make a decision based off her response. Instead, you acted like a child.", "NTA. But why would you want to be with her after you went 4 days without talking to her or even communicating that you needed some time apart?", "Could still have had an \"ok\" night if you'd have just gotten over yourself and stayed. Oppenheimer wasn't going anywhere.", "NTA. That would have infuriated me. If it\u2019s your money, and you agreed upon it, that is unbelievably uncool. And you go on a date night once a month? Cuz that\u2019s all you can afford? She is way out of line. I\u2019m a woman by the way, if it matters. And I do NOT like practical jokes of any kind, let alone the kind that costs the one date night you can afford per MONTH.", "NTA. Your GF doesn't care for about you. You are better off without her. Her \"joke\" isn't funny at all.", "If you\u2019re so worried about your money why didn\u2019t you buy the tickets yourself?", "Some of these comments are wild. No accountability for the girlfriend, spinning it to where he did something wrong. NTA OP.", "YTA. Just because you went nuclear (she would have been the AH had you not acted like a complete toddler, but your response without any communication was over the top). \n\nAs commentators have suggested - this relationship is likely over (I could never forgive your behavior). Learn to communicate and do better next time. Your behavior is normal only if you are leaving the person with intention to burn all bridges. Perhaps would have been an appropriate response to cheating.\n\nBtw, I found her joke to be funny. Would have laughed if my bf did it :) If I did not have enough money - I would inform him that he has to pay for Oppenheimer next weekend and I would still laugh.", "NTA, you dodged a bullet.", "Esh, yeah she shouldn\u2019t have spent your money on the movie she wanted when you agreed on another movie, but also why didn\u2019t you just pay for the tickets if it was your money? And leaving her stranded alone at the movies without even saying a word is a straight up ah move. This all seems very immature on both parts", "ESH\n\nYour ex gf played a prank on you (apparently) by booking a different movie without telling you, and booking one she knew you wouldn't want to see. If she even suspected that you would react like you did, if she knew that it would \"ruin\" your night, it was an AH move. Even if she didn't suspect a thing, I always think pranks are AH moves unless you are certain the other person will find it funny.\n\nYou, my dear, were the bigger AH. Barbie might not have been your favourite movie but you could have looked at her, said I really wanted to see Oppenheimer, so I don't love you did that, then gone in to enjoy your food, enjoy your fancy seats, and enjoy a movie which you probably would have been pleasantly surprised by. Instead you threw a tantrum and ruined your own night, ruined her night, and ruined your relationship.\n\nIf you're willing to learn, there's a lesson here. Shit happens. Being flexible is more likely to give you a good time than being rigid. Communication is more likely to get you what you want/make you feel respected, than throwing a tantrum/silent treatment.", "Maybe I\u2019m just petty as fuck too but definitely NTA. I\u2019m a firm believer of making inconsiderate  decisions = fuck around and find out. Y\u2019all are grown, she obviously found a ride. She didn\u2019t call till 20 minutes into the movie\u2026she used your money on a move SHE wanted to see without telling you. I\u2019m in a committed long term relationship and I\u2019d never use my partner\u2019s money on something different than originally stated without asking. It\u2019s a violation of trust and foreshadows future decisions with money while you guys are together. \n\nYou should have communicated though \u2014 a quick text letting her know she will need a ride/Uber at least. Working minimum wage full time is no joke and they money can go so quickly, especially with bills. You\u2019re young, I\u2019d say just make your life easier and move on or thoroughly communicate this out if you really want to get back together with her. Good luck!", "NTA. She agreed to Oppenheimer. You trusted her to get tickets for Oppenheimer. She unilaterally decided to get tickets to Barbie (gag). I would have been furious, too. I would have gone back to the box office & exchanged the ticket. Since Oppenheimer is 3 hours and Barbie less than 2, she would have been shit out of luck for a ride anyway. Not surprised someone who could do that would break up when you didn't take it well. You dodged a bullet, my friend.", "YTA\n\nThis is just a cute funny thing.  Learn to lighten up and enjoy the time you\u2019re spending with someone.  That was an intense reaction for something that might have mildly annoyed you.", "I saw both movies back to back this weekend. \n\nESH.", "NTA.OP LMAO you actually dodged a bullet here,let the idiot go,a fookin walkin red flag she is.", "NTA. Money is tight for you and this is something you were looking forward to. If she wanted to go for Barbie, she should have told you beforehand so you guys could have come to a middle point but she didn\u2019t. She spent your money to give you a \u201csurprise\u201d when she knew you would probably have to wait another month to watch a movie you were looking forward to. If I were you, I would be going forward with the break up.", "YTA - so she switched up what movie to watch. Ask yourself, really, just really, how big of a deal it is.", "NTA for leaving. But you're kinda dumb that you didn't realise that would end in a break up.", "ESH. She\u2019s TA for using your money for something not agreed upon, yta for overreacting.", "YTA. I\u2019m giving her the benefit of the doubt because your writing indicates you are unable to effectively communicate. Most of what you typed leaves HUGE holes for the reader to inject their own interpretation of what actually happened and make their decisions based on their own bias instead of what happened. Luckily, the situation matters WAY less than your actions which is what makes you the asshole. \n\nYou left her. You walked out on her and left her. Beyond being massively unsafe to leave a young woman stranded somewhere, why do you think you could get away with that? You literally left her and then didn\u2019t call her for 4 days and now Pok\u00e9mon face when she\u2019s out? Who do you think you are? What do you have to offer? Grow up, use your words, quit being an asshole.", "YTA- It\u2019s quite simple, if you felt that was the straw that broke the camel\u2019s back just end it there. Leave her to her own means and move on. The fact you still wanted to get with her is just plain stupid. You handled it horribly. If you still wanted the relationship, you wouldn\u2019t have left and talked to her about it, and would request your money back, it\u2019s not the end of the world, but you treated it that way by just leaving on your own like a little baby.", "NTA but stupidly beta passive aggressive move if you intended to do this AND still be with her.   \"You should have said either come with me now or you're watching this movie alone and I'll come pick you up, I was really looking forward to seeing Oppenheimer.\"", "YTA. Did it never enter your mind that she may have bought the right tickets, but you were misdirected to the wrong screening room of the multiplex by the ticket taker?\n\nWhen you walked out, she may have thought you were finding out what the right room was.", "NTA - The fact she thinks you're in the wrong here makes me think you are dodging a bullet by letting this one go her own way.", "[deleted]", "NTA clearly. \n\nShe should've definitely tried to at least apologize. OP did nothing wrong by going silent. Why should he reach out first to her when she didn't even bother to try and apologize? Why is she entitled to using OP's limited money on something else than what it was agreed on and not having any consequences? \n\nShe is definitely TA, not OP. \n\nWhat I don't understand is why would OP want to continue a relationship where he gets disrespected? I get it that if she would've come later on that day or the next day to apologize and realized her actions were nowhere near \"funny\" and would've made up for it by paying OP back his money or buying him a ticket to see the movie he wanted to see, that could've been taken as making amends and moving on. Everything is fine then. But the mere fact that she didn't bother to take contact for 4 days, waiting for OP to do it when she was the one who screwed up and should've contacted first to apologize, is beyond me and shows immaturity and honestly, is unforgivable because it shows 0 respect and entitlement. \n\nSomeone who can't see when they're wrong and screw up and is not able to apologize, that person is a walking red flag.", "NTA", "NTA, but you shouldn't run after someone that doesn't care about your opinion like that.

You trusted her after the discussion. She should have objected or bought barbie tickets with her money not yours.

She booked tickets.\"\n\nSo I assume they agreed on watching it, and she booked for Barbie instead.", "Sounds like he said \u201cI\u2019m going to see Oppenheimer\u201d and she was like \u201clet\u2019s see it together?\u201d If that\u2019s NOT what happened, then the way OP phrased this was totally manipulative.", "Aka it should be ESH then", "FYI the bot won\u2019t count your judgement with the letters transposed like that. Should be E S H (no spaces of course).", "No, the GF dumped him because it\u2019s easier than reflecting and apologising for doing wrong", "I agree. Communication is key", "When we agreed to watch Oppenheimer she booked the tickets for us, so I only got to see what movie we were when we got directions from the ticket guy.", "I agree with ESH, OP reacted very poorly but tbh that is not a harmless joke, nor is it a healthy one in a relationship. OP already mentioned they only get to do these things once a month because of his financial situation. Assuming she bought the wrong tickets with intent (she laughed), that's borderline theft. Imagine if you asked your friend to buy you something with your hard-earned cash and they bought something that they want with it instead. If she wants to watch a different movie with him, she should buy a separate pair of tickets with her money instead.", "First of all, she was holding the tickets the entire time. I thought I could trust her because we agreed. Looking back I think she was holding the tickets to hide them from me. The ticket guy just pointed us to the theatre and she walked there without any hesitation.", "And therefore with a smile and congratulations ? Will you say the same if the role were reverse or it's just because she is a woman and she is entilted to her boyfriend ? Did I miss something ? Since when you take the money of someone else to buy what you want instead of what you've had agreed before", "The 'joke' is very close to petty theft.  It's wild to me how comfortable and how much of a non issue some people think using other people's money is for things that aren't agreed on.\n\n\"But they're your partner, it should just be a joke and you should just laugh it off I mean money comes and money goes!\"\n\nPartners don't steal from partners.  Am I actually going to get you charged with something?  No, unless it's some big money we're talking.  But you've shown you're a thief, you can't be trusted and you're no longer partner material.", "God forbid trust be a thing in relationships", "What kind of response is this. This is such a common thing for couples to do at the cinema. One person gets the tickets while the other gets the snacks to save time. You should not have to stay next to your partner because you think they will buy a ticket for another movie. OP did nothing wrong here and the fact that the gf thinks he is the one in the wrong here is ridiculous", "I completely agree with you. The one I can't get over is the one from this woman who is blaming OP when he did nothing wrong. lol I believe you commented on that as well", "I suspect they did the usual thing of, here's the money, you get the tickets, I'll get the snacks. Or she arrived earlier/got out of the car first while he parked it and bought them while he was doing that.", "He only has enough money to do one fun things he wants in a month. Her spending it on her whim is not a cute funny thing. If he were not financially constricted it would be a cute funny thing, and even then maybe not because theaters can be expensive.", "He said it was the only movie he could afford this month. She used his money to buy tickets to something he didn't want to see when he thought they were going to see something else. If this was at their house and she loaded in the wrong DVD, whatever, but this was at the cinema. For him, it was a big deal.", "IT ACTUALLY IS A BIG DEAL WHEN SHE DIDN'T LET HIM KNOW AND USED HIS MONEY TO DECEIVE HIM . HIS LIMITED AMOUNT OF MONEY. ON SOMETHING SHE WANTED. WITHOUT EVEN APOLOGIZING AFTERWARD. THE FUCKING ENTITLEMENT. YOU'RE SO FUCKING DELUSIONAL AND JUST AS MUCH OF A WALKING RED FLAG IF YOU THINK THAT'S AN A-OKAY BEHAVIOR AND DON'T HOLD HER ACCOUNTABLE FOR IT, INSTEAD HERE YOU ARE TRYING TO BLAME OP, WHO DID NOTHING WRONG BTW.", "But it is his money lmao. What are you talking about?", "I don\u2019t care he left, I care that he left *but didn\u2019t tell her he left* he didn\u2019t even know how she got home, he assumes she took an Uber but we don\u2019t know that to be true. She is 1000% wrong for buying a movie he didn\u2019t agree to, but he stranded her at night at the movies. What if no Ubers were out and she had to walk, what if she didn\u2019t have the money for an Uber so she had to walk. Or she had to call a friend to pick her up and she was left waiting for hours outside in the cold. My point is, we don\u2019t know how she got home bc this guy didn\u2019t care enough to find out. Safety comes first, he\u2019s a major ah for thinking she\u2019d still be his gf after literally not caring about her safety and if I were her that\u2019d be my first thought. To be fair I wouldn\u2019t do what she did, but even still (at least in the US) if you walk out of a movie within the first 20 minutes you can get it refunded, they likely would\u2019ve let him go into the movie he wanted to see if he chose to. So he could\u2019ve done that and they both got to see the movie they wanted, everyone\u2019s happy. But he just up and left and didn\u2019t say a word or ask her how she got home.", "Is this from the comments, because it's not at all in the post?", "What does ESH stand for?", "Only the top comment counts", "Leaving someone stranded is a bit worse than spending $12 of their money on a movie ticket. \n\nAlso why do I get the feeling that this \"agreement\" conversation was more of an argument?", "I agree this was completely out of line on her part, but I wouldn\u2019t have just gone home. I would have gone right back to the ticket person and asked for an exchange for a ticket for the next showing of \u201cOppenheimer.\u201d \n\n(If this was back in the good old days before assigned seats, I probably would have just skipped the ticket guy and just found an empty seat in Oppenheimer if there was one)\n\nWhen she told me she did it on purpose, I\u2019d tell her I felt that she really did it because she wanted to see it and not because she thought I\u2019d find it funny, and that made me feel deceived or used, or like she felt I was someone could manipulate. I\u2019d say that I will be watching Oppenheimer tonight as planned, one way or another. Either we each watch our own, or we do a double feature (the second one on her dime).\n\nHer answer would tell me all that I needed to know.", "If you are getting hung up on such a little \"problem\" well get ready for more because you will make your life harder. Real problems will come and go, this did not need to be one of them.", "So many tight people here. \n\nWhat about this: you laugh and then inform the gf that you will watch her movie, but she is taking you to Oppenheimer next week! \n\nIf she agrees (which may have very well been her intention!) - it\u2019s a funny joke and you still have a relationship!", "Reddit is wild lmao borderline theft over booking $25 dollar Barbie tickets instead of Oppenheimer. OP reacted badly and ruined his relationship\u2026.over 10s of dollars.", "Again, who paid for the tickets? Cause even if you paid for them it\u2019s a mildly annoying thing where you could say \u201cI want to see this movie\u201d and then leave instead of stomping off and then being shocked she doesn\u2019t want to date you", "NTA but, she's not a nice person as she knew what tickets she bought, lied to u (by omission) hid them so you couldn't see them and then just expected you to see Barbie with her? \nWhy would you want to keep seeing a sneaky AH like her? You can do better...", "jeeesus. dont be in a relationship, this is a harmless joke.", "It's wild the lengths they go through to keep from calling this woman an asshole for a situation she entirely created.", "He said that she booked the tickets pretty sure, which sounds like she paid online. The movie theaters where I live usually if you didn\u2019t pay online then you have to pay before you can get snacks but idk it could be different maybe you\u2019re right lol. Either way I feel like they\u2019re both wrong, she should\u2019ve got the movie they agreed to, but him just up and walking out and expecting them to be a couple still is just.. audacious.", "How do you know that the gf would not have paid for Oppenheimer e.g. next week? \n\nTo me this reads as a cute and innocent joke, and if OP had any communication skills, he would have found out. If she blatantly refused to pay for Oppenheimer - then she would be the AH. Guess who will never find out! The single OP :)", "He said in the post \u201cI stated my intention to see Oppenheimer\u201d and then says \u201cwe agreed.\u201d\n\nThe only logical, realistic, social human interpretation of this is that OP decided to see the movie, said so, and then they decided to go together.\n\nNow\u2026 *like I explicitly said, to prevent people from making the exact comment you just made\u2026.*\n\nIf that is NOT what happened, then OP specifically wrote it to make it *sound* like that\u2019s what happened, without expressly lying, but without telling the whole story, in which case it would be manipulative on his part.\n\nWhich is a distinct possibility.", "Everyone sucks here. Because if you were originally NTA, that means you thought the girlfriend at least had some AH part here.", "Everyone sucks here", "Everyone's Shit Here.", "where are you getting $12 movie tickets??? ours are like $17", "BF works on minimum wage, the tickets and refreshments cost quite a lot these days.\n\nHe went there with the expectation of watching Oppenheimer, the GFs choice to buy Barbie tickets and hide it until they are at the cinema is far worse than choosing to walk out and go home once you found out that you\u2019d been had over. (That\u2019s ignoring the fact that many men have 0% interest in sitting through the Barbie movie regardless)", "Well OP doesnt seem to have a ton of money so 12$ is a lot to him.", "Also, he could have laughed it off because for all we know she could have thought that could pull a barbenheimer and see that movie later on, on her dime. What she did was shitty but easily fixable. Abandoning is less so. Now those tickets funds she owes you were spent on overpriced transportation", "Exactly this.\n\nSwap out the ticket. Go see your show. And the ball would have been in her court to join you after her \"joke\" was done.", "The correct way to deal with this situation lol.", "I'm not saying being laid back is in anyway bad for ALL relationships, but it's pretty clear to me that being laid back with handling finances is not a thing with OP since his situation simply does not permit it; you can't joke around and spend disposable income when it's not there. GF wasn't wrong for wanting to have fun but he's not wrong for being so uptight with how his money is spent either, and the thing is GF signed up to a relationship with OP; you can argue that OP shouldn't date with his financial situation but it's not like only one agreed to be in it. This probably wouldn't be an issue if OP was more well-off but that's not the case here. \n\nIf I'm being real here, it's probably good that they broke up, she wants to experience and explore things but he has his priorities. Neither are assholes for wanting different things but in this situation they both fucked up by how they went about it.", "Did you miss the part where they don't have much money and can't do this sort of thing often.", "That's right, blame him when he did nothing but trust his girlfriend. Why are you giving her a pass, when she created the problem in the first place.", "How is this OP's fault? She's clearly an entitled brat, and according to your comments, so are you.\n\nETA: Maybe if you take a bit more time thinking and reading before commenting, you'd end up realizing that OP actually wrote on his post that the GF used HIS money to deceive him.", "Don't worry for me or my boyfriend. \nI don't \"joke\" stealing my boyfriend's money for my own pleasure.", "Bet you if the roles were reversed, everyone would still be calling OP the AH and ranting on about how he bought tickets to a different movie with someone else's money and how entitled he is.", "Clearly the gf doesn\u2019t have respect for money so she must have enough to spare for an Uber home", "Except they\u2019re both new movies and probably had full theatres. \n\nI agree it was a shitty thing to trick him into going to see the Barbie movie but it\u2019s also shitty to walk out without telling your partner you\u2019re going home and leaving them stranded. Then pulling a surprised Pikachu face when he didn\u2019t try to talk to her for four days and she said they should break up.", "I really did. Where did OP write that gf doesn\u2019t have money? What indicates that she would not have paid for Oppenheimer?", "Because he didn't communicate with her whatsoever and just left instead. Maybe she had a plan, maybe she also bought Oppenheimer tickets for the next weekend, but he'll never know now because he didn't bother to speak to his girlfriend and just left her there, then still expected the relationship to continue after ghosting her for *4 days* like a child.\n\nESH - she shouldn't have bought the wrong tickets on purpose as a joke, he should have communicated instead of driving off and ghosting her.", "ABSOLUTELY!!!  And then they'd tell her to dump him because she can do better \ud83e\udd23", "Why would he need to communicate? They had a plan. She is the one who changed the plan, so wouldn't the responsibility of communication be hers? You're doing a lot of maybe to keep from calling her an asshole.", "If he wanted to stay in the relationship he should have spoken to her instead of ghosting her for 4 days. If he didn't want to stay in the relationship he should have spoken to her instead of ghosting her for 4 days. Also he should have told her how he felt about what she did and that its not acceptable to him, instead of ghosting her for 4 days. That's what people in healthy relationships do. \n\nNeither of them were mature enough to be in a relationship, which is why my judgement was ESH. They were both assholes."]}
