I have a 3 month old and wife is still on Maternity leave.  They came to visit me at work and brought Chick Fil A for lunch.  There is a canal area that has half a dozen decent sized grassy areas with benches.  There is a walking path along it that gets a decent amount of traffic.\n\nWe find a completely empty grassy area with a bench.  There is no one around and its really nice out.  My kid is sitting in the stroller just being chill.  I'm talking to both my kid and wife while we are eating.  My kid starts crying and I pick him up to soothe him.  I see an over 50 guy walking by and he is eyeing us.  Figured he was looking at my kid since he was crying.  When all of a sudden a maybe 5 pound unleashed dog comes up and licks my wifes ankle.  This scared the shit out of her.  We are not exactly dog friendly.  Neither of us grew up with dogs and have zero interest in owning, let alone interacting with them.\n\nThen a second small dog walks up to us.  I turn to the guy and say get your dogs away from us.  He just looks at me with this dopey look on his face.  So I say it again.  He half heartedly tells the dogs to come to him.  They don't listen to him.  I'm like come on man, get your effing dogs away from us.  We are eating lunch and don't want them around.  My kid is still crying.  My wife asks him to get them away too.\n\nHe says to me \"You don't like dogs?\".  I'm just like no, I don't like dogs, I also hate bad (I used a worse word) owners like you that don't leash their dogs and let them rudely walk up to people.  I don't want your dogs around.  He tells me I don't have to be so rude. I responded back with you are the effing prick that decided to let your dogs occupy the same ten square feet as us despite their being other areas to go.  If you wouldn't have bothered us, I wouldn't be flipping out on you. He looked shocked that someone didn't adore his dogs and walks away muttering at me under his breath.  So Am I the Asshole?\n\nEdit: This is not a dog park, or even a regular park.  Just an area with multiple grassy areas.  There is a lot of signage to pick up poop and leash your dogs.
