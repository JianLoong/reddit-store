It was an arranged marriage. Anyway, in 2020 we had a son. I was happy and over the moon, but as days passed on, I started to see some differences, like not  having any physical resemblance to me. I ordered a DNA test kit, and yeah, not the dad.\nI confronted my wife, we had a lot of drama, and she admitted to still be in contact of her ex.\nI filed for divorce. The way the laws are framed in my country (India), private DNA tests are not considered evidence, only court ordered ones. And court won't order a paternity test until I can prove I had no physical access to wife. So any child born during wedlock is considered legitimate one if husband has access to wife.\n\nAnyway, I did get divorce based on adultery, but was ordered to pay child support. I have no bond with the child, and I just can't. 1 week ago, my ex died in a car accident with her AP. Her parents are asking me to take her son because I am his legal guardian on all papers.

Regardless of the legal situation, I think this is the point you should be making to the family of the child.", "NTA. It's ridiculous to think that you should be saddled with another man's kid because of some backward law.", "NTA but I have so many questions. Where is the child now? Do your EX's parents know that you are not the father. Does the biological fathers family know the child exists? They may want to have custody if you don't.  Either way its a tragedy for this poor child.", "NTA. If everyone sending you nasty messages is OK with a non-related person parenting this child, then they should all be in line for parenting this child.", "NTA what a shitty situation. I feel sorry for the child. But having to grow up being resented by persen raising him won't do him any good either. Can you give up your parentel rights in India?", "NTA. That's not your child.", "NTA. It's sad for the child the circumstances and all, but it doesn't make you responsible for righting her wrong.\n\nI respectfully don't understand the logic of the courts not ordering a DNA test at your request if the courts also awarded you a divorce based on adultery. Obviously if that was acknowledged than paternity is in question.", "NTA - why would the grandparents want their grandkid to go to what is effectively now a random dude? If anything, they're the 2-4 people in the world with the most connection to the kid. If they want it raised in a loving, caring environment they can step up themselves.", "NTA - her family can take the child, you do not have to", "Poor baby...", "NTA. The situation is awful but the child isn't yours, you feel no love towards them and it would be cruel to you both if you took him into your home.", "NTA. I do feel bad for the child, since the child played no part in this. But this doesn\u2019t make you responsible either. I hope you find a way through this.", "NTA.  Does AP mean affair partner?  Assuming it does, is there any way you can contact that family and show them the paternity test?  And if he is still alive, can't you just show him?", "NTA. Because it's not your child, it's understandable why you don't want to take the responsibility. However, I do recommend that you consider the child's well-being and needs because he is innocent. Perhaps a counselor can guide you on ethical considerations, but that is respectfully up to you, of course.", "NTA. Not your child.", "Nope. Mama should have not been stepping out. Sorry lil homie you for the streets too.", "Just because you are currently legally responsible, and have been paying child support doesn't mean you have to raise him and I can't see he would benefit from the care of an adult that is unable to bond with him.  \n\nBut whilst NTA for not wanting to take him in, you could become TA by not ensuring his wellbeing and future is secured. After all, the little boy is innocent in this and has just lost his mother, and needs a home where he will be cared for. \n\nIf you are the boy's legal guardian, I guess that means you can determine who will be responsible for the child's care, or give him up in a private adoption, so if his bio-dad's family are around, good people and in a financial and physical position that they could raise the kid, you could look at that option. \n\nAs far as your family, and your ex's, it is unclear whether they know the child is not biologically yours, or are simply expecting you to take responsibility as legal guardian - and maybe trying to off-load any obligation/responsibility onto you. If the latter applies to your ex's family, they are the AHs here. I wonder, if they are so concerned about his wellbeing, whether they have even considered if they could step up to give kid a loving home.", "NTA. They should be contacting the boy\u2019s real father.", "NTA and I\u2019m so sorry\n\nWith my first born, my ex wanted a DNA test, I was highly offended knowing it was his son and said go for it as I knew it was solid\n\nIn Australia the grounds were- didn\u2019t look like the father, sex wasn\u2019t possible in the time frame of conception. Yes for both, DNA was a 99+% (and baby was his dads clone at birth)\n\nProving a child is yours is stressful enough, let alone proving they aren\u2019t\n\nOP, I am so sorry archaic laws are in place in India- and you are bound by this rule that he is your unwanted child out of wedlock", "NTA. I hope you can find a way out of this. I am so sorry.", "NAH\nThe a-holes in this situation are dead. However, you are the legal father and that carries obligations. You need to resolve the child's guardianship with his grandparents. Your feelings are valid and 100% justified. Legally, feelings don't change anything.\nBe honest with the grandparents and work together to legally resolve the child's place in the world. If you abandon him without that, you will open yourself to painful legal consequences.", "NTA But i wouldn't be against adopting the kid anyway so long as you can make it clear that biological father has no access.  I don't know how law's there worked.  It sounds like you wanted the kid to be yours at first.  It would come with difficulty of course but if you are emotionally stable enough I don't see a problem with it.\n\nOf course, I'm also not the one in the situation so I don't know the full context of everything and it's always easier from the outside looking in.", "Where is the actual father?", "YTA for agreeing to an arranged marriage to a woman who clearly didn't want it. From the sound of it, she had a boyfriend that her parents didn't like. They made her get married to you. YTA for getting married to a woman who clearly didn't want to marry you and then being mad when she still saw her boyfriend.\n\nI don't think you should be the one taking care of this poor kid, but he's an innocent in all this, so find a relative of the kid and pay child support. This poor kid deserves love and you clearly are incapable of this feeling.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
