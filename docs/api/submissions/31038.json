Natalie is 39 and she broke up with her boyfriend at about the same time as me (6 months ago).  \r  \nOver the past 6 months her behaviour has got more and more icky, she sends regular voice messages on whattsapp to my sister, all of which are around the latest drama in her life and the latest man she is chasing following her breakup and how upset she is. She has slept with 7 people since breaking up with the apparent love of her life 6 months ago.\r  \n\r  \nShe was stalking her electrician on social media to see if he was single just because he spoke to her when he came to install a socket at her flat, the next week she's asking about HIV tests because she's slept with some random guy she met on Tinder, now she's it's yet another guy she has slept with who she keeps stalking in the local pub by going in there \"pretending to look for something\", then she's gone back to her ex and he's told her it's a mistake the next day.\r  \n\r  \nWhenever I have time with my sister her phone will be ringing and guess what? It's Natalie with another drama.  My sister is fed up of her, but she is friends with her and has already told her to stop but tolerates it because they're close.\r  \n\r  \nMy sister recently went to Rome with her boyfriend and wasn't available to talk to, so Natalie suddenly messages me asking how I am. Yet again she's dumping all the latest dramas about how the most recent bloke isn't interested in her and dumped her after sleeping with her. I gave her support and advice which was essentially, stop dating and work on yourself. My sister says exactly the same thing.  She says she agrees and \"finally realises\" then basically does the same shit the very next day.\r  \n\r  \nNatalie is very well aware that this year I have had to leave my home due to an abusive relationship, I was engaged, owned a house and literally left all of it which was horrible. There is a ton of expensive legal stuff around mine/my ex's house and that is stressing me out. \r  \nI got straight into therapy and joined a gym and it is literally a daily struggle sometimes trying to put my life back together. I have also had to send my ex a cease and desist letter after a ton of post seperation abuse.\r  \n\r  \nThis morning I got yet more messages from Natalie and just lost it, I told her to grow the f up, get therapy and stop leaching everyone elses time and energy on her pathetic problems. I told her that if she wants to sleep around that's fine and if she wants to endlessly chase men then that's up to her but I literally had no bandwidth to listen to her making excuses for herself if she wasn't prepared to better herself. I also told her that it hadn't gone un-noticed that she was \"checking in on me\" at the convenient time that my sister was unavailable to dump on.  I feel awful but I literally am sick and tired of her constant moaning and refusing point blank to change anything in her life.  So I told her.

You didn't have to respond to Natalie or entertain her messages or calls in the first place, so that's on you.

I honestly don\u2019t understand why people (not just you) believe that the way to solve a problem is by creating more problems.\n\nIf people annoy you then don\u2019t waste your time engaging with them. All you do is open the door for more communication. Now she gets to tell you (or your sister) that you hurt her feelings & back on the drama merry-go-round y\u2019all go. \n\nYou\u2019re not an asshole but just stop responding.

Otherwise she will soon lose all her friends and any potential boyfriend. She needs to grieve her break up, not repeat the toxic crap she is currently doing in order to not face her issues.", "You did her a favor", "Stop responding. Also who tf has a dedicated electrician?", "NTA the world needs more honesty like this. Time for the overly soft anxiety ridden self made victims to hear the truth and do better. Bless you!", "NTA\n\nYou should have told her the first time.  Once you open the door to the Natalies of the world, it never stops.  She loves the drama and the attention.\n\nAs for Natalie, she will find a man, many of them.  Plenty of men will sleep with her but none will ever get into a relationship with her.  She's toxic.", "ESH.. shes TA for constantly dumping her drama on everybody IDK maybe your sister enjoys that secrectly I know I love drama.. but your definitely TA for how you handled it. I understand your fustrated and upset but you still have to consider this is your sisters friend who she wants to maintain a relationship with. What you did is probably going to reflect back onto your sister but I'm sure you didn't think of that.  \n\n\nEDIT: I didn't even think of this but if neither of you truthfully expressed your irritation with her problems or her telling you about her antics how would she have known to stop?

I think for me the issue has been directly influenced by what's been going on in my own life and how this woman is just so blatantly disregarding of anyone elses issues.    End result:   I think I am a bit of a jerk here, i wouldn't have posted if I hadn't known that to be honest.   I just kinda wanted to gauge how much of a peen I'd been because right now I am not in the best place to gauge anything.  She won't get anymore responses/comms from me either way which is best for everyone.", "I (54f) did not figure this out until I had 4 kids & just didn\u2019t have the time or capacity to deal with other people\u2019s problems. It\u2019s completely okay to say nothing.

It\u2019s a waste of time & energy. \n\nSide note - The one thing I have noticed being on Reddit is if someone says something people don\u2019t like they just \u201chave\u201d to respond. It\u2019s bizarre to me. People can say shitty things & no response is required. It\u2019s totally fine. People who say shitty things or don\u2019t have any interest in listening don\u2019t deserve a response. It\u2019s okay to just walk away say nothing. Keep on keeping on. Trying to out asshole other people just continues the cycle & is a huge waste of time.\n\neta \u2014 100% agree \u2026 I can\u2019t help you is such an acceptable response!!\n\neta more \u2014 that side note was not intended for you. Just an observation.", "Honestly I would just sit her down and tell her that. In a calm and straight manner. If she chooses to not take your advice (which she is allowed to do) then I would suggest you go low contact with her. Sometimes being a friend is listening to someone on repeat (I have been that person), but if you aren\u2019t in the mental place to do so you need to be up front about it.", "Honestly the best thing to do would be to try to solve her issue instead of disregarding her. Your sister should be sitting her friend down and telling her her behavoir is destructive and her promiscuity is only going to hurt her especially because shes not being safe about it or using protection. \n\nanyways I love tea so if you remember any of her crazy antics I'd love to hearr", "You're so right to be honest.  I knew it as soon as it came out of my mouth.  In my puny defense i've stayed shut about it for 6 months and I have just had a SHIT TON going on in my life which is pretty serious stuff and she's bitching about why some guy didn't call or some girl isn't her friend.  I think my ego was like i'm going to say something and I just verbally blaahhhhd out everything then said nothing afterwards.  And will continue to say nothing becasue she is an embarassment to the gender with her behaviour, if she's going to go on like that with men she should start charging for it because it's gross.", "To be honest she is my sisters friend and my aquaintance, I don't know her that well but I just really have a problem with her \"checking in on me\" when I haven't heard from her for months then suddenly she wants to check in when my sister is away and before long i'm listening to her problems.  My sisters boyfriend is getting sick of her, and I am getting sick of listening to my sister moan about her and I just don't really want anything else to do with her if i'm honest.   I've tried to support her but she only pops up when she wants something.", "Well honestly I probably should have said this already but this outburst from me is after literally 6 months of heart to heart conversations and sitting her down and providing constant support to her and links to resources etc.  My sister is a nurse, she has explained all the health implications.  This girl literally just makes excuses and denies reality constantly.    She's also apparently suprised that I haven't done the same following my break up.  I think I just reached my limit but I was a dick I admit it, I was harsh when I could have just ignored.   If you want tea... she's a literal tidal wave of tea.... it has gotten pretty ridiculous to be honest, often quite funny such as \"I have to have this guy stay at mine because there is a mouse in my loft and I'm scared\" to \"He can't stay in the spare room because there is clothes on the bed and i dont' have time to tidy them\" - it gets ridiculous.  But also it's kind of sad really.... but if I can avoid jumping on every dk in town I am sure as shit that she can!! Like enough already!!", "Everyone has walked into that trap. It\u2019s a hard lesson to learn. Trust me my mouth wants to say exactly what I am thinking. Not always pleasant. My brain takes its own time to catch up & remind me \u2026 say nothing! Lol", "OHHHH.. now with the added context NTA lol. Ay you can't save everybody. Initallly when you wrote the post I imagined she was just venting and you guys were standing there like mmhmm mhm.. also why is she making excuses as if you two are stupid LOL you know her intentions. I have a promiscious older sister who gets with men just as frequently and everytime I call her out you should see her face or her excuses.. I know exactly what your going through. It's not a self control issue she just has a lack of self esteem and needs validation from a man. ATP she needs therapy.. and some yoga classes or meditation so she can take her mind off MEN! LOL", "Ohhh yeah sorry that is MY fault because I didn't explain, I am so shit at explaining things.  I told her to get therapy in my outburst to her this morning to be honest, and yes if she wants to open her legs go to f'ing yoga!! lol.   No idea why she's so obsessed with men... they're over rated at the best of times and my life has been better since i left that spot vacant in my life for a few months.  It is all validation...i get it, i was there in my 20's but seriously 39 is time to grow up now."]}
