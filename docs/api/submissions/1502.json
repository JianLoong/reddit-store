For the last 16 years I have gone by my new name [we'll call me Ruth] and consider my birth name a \"dead name.\" Now, I didn't change it because I am trans, but there was a lot of intense conflict with both parents growing up, including aggressive homophobia from my father. I didn't come out of the closet to my family until well into my 20's because of it. A new name in a new city (college) was a fresh start for me. \n\nMy father opposed my name change from the start. I honestly think my mother strong armed him to keep him from showing up in court to object. Since the day I changed my name, my father has refused to use it and insists on calling me by my birth name because \"That's not what I named you.\" It's not just me. My sister's kid came out as um.... gender neutral? I'm having trouble remembering the word right now. Anyway they/them pronouns and everything and a new name. I support the young person (my nibbling I think is the word?) \ud83d\udcaf and have defended their identity to my father several times. Each time I get anything from an exasperated \"Whatever\" to outright hostility and anti-LGBTQ+ rhetoric. Remember, I am part of that community, too, and I am raising my kids that it's a variation of normal. \n\nI moved around the USA following my job for the last 10 years so contact with my father has been limited. We moved back to my home state because my Aunt died last year and left me her estate. \n\nMy parents were at my house last week and my father kept calling me by my birth name to my husband, and in front of my children (10), (7&7), (2). I corrected him loudly from the kitchen where I was having coffee with my mother. I got the usual \"Whatever.\" When I was done with my conversation I went into my living room, called him by HIS name instead of \"dad\", made major eye contact, and very firmly said \"My name is Ruth.\" He dismissively said \"Ok\" and went back to his conversation. \n\nWhen they left I followed my father out for a showdown. It was 16 years coming. Went something like:  Me: My name is Ruth. Him: OK. Me: I expect to be called by my legal name. I have been Ruth for sixteen years. Almost half of my life. Him: I am 64 years old and -- Me: *cuts him off* I don't care. Him: Exactly. We will have to agree to disagree. Me: No, my name is Ruth. \n\nHe turned his back on me and walked to the car.
