{"id": 25160, "submission_id": "15x23ag", "title": "AITA for being bitchy to my husband before roadtrips?", "selftext": "Background: I've been with my husband(35m) since I (29f) was 18. He went back to school for 8 years & I was the breadwinner (our parents helped us too). He went back to give us a better life so I was happy to support him. It was a difficult time for him & made me want to step up even more. All this to say, he had no income & couldn't plan trips for us.\n\nIn our 10 years, I've planned most if not all of our trips (he did at the beginning, around 9 years ago when he was working fulltime). I don't mind though, I really enjoy planning trips and all that comes with it. It's genuinely fun for me. I wish he would give a bit of input sometimes, but it's ok, he's always happy with my choices.\n\nThe hardest part is I struggle with feeling annoyed or unappreciated before our trips. There's always tension on the day or roadtrips.\n\nBecause I do all the planning, I have a set time I want to get somewhere. If I don't push him to hurry, we never get there on time. We never do anyway, but one time we didn't get to our spot til 7pm, I feel it's a waste of our day & hard-earned money \ud83d\ude2d\n\nAnyway, what gets me is he ALWAYS dilly dallies the day of. He almost always decides that's when he's going to do that thing I asked him to do weeks ago. Or he HAS to clean something. Or he's just scrolling his phone or playing video games. Things like that. It reads like he doesn't care about the trip. I try not to take it personally and keep our energy light by giving him gentle nudges at first, like \"hey babe, do you think we can still get there on time?\" Or \"can you please jump in the shower?\" etc. But honestly, then I just get annoyed and bitchy when I don't see a change in his behaviour or he remains non-chalant--almost dismissive.\n\nI put a lot of effort into these trips so we can have fond memories together. I think it's so important when we've been together for so long. I try to make it fun AND romantic for us both. But why does he act like it's a chore? He loads things into our vehicle and drives us there. I even take care of a babysitter for our lizard. He rarely mentions our trips together, but will go on and on about his trip to Australia as a 19 year old.\n\nAnyway, I usually get annoyed and that makes him annoyed and then the whole trip or at least the ride there is just tense and hard for us. I do feel unreasonable and crazy for being annoyed at him, he never actually does anything shitty except take his sweet time? I feel unseen and unheard and he feels I am being a bad partner.\n\nToday the same thing happened. I planned a trip an hour away. He said he would do laundry then shower, but he did a load and then  just scrolled his phone. I finished the laundry, packed our things, loaded the cooler & he still hadn't showered. When I caught an attitude he told me \"not to ruin another car trip\". We just acted like nothing happened because my sister was with us. But damn.

Maybe he doesn\u2019t actually like it anymore and doesn\u2019t tell you because he feels like it\u2019s fun for you to organise it? Or maybe he just genuinely cannot be bothered with being on time? \n\nIn any case, have a chat with him, and be sure to tell him how you feel as well, to avoid having this resentment.\n\nBut yea you\u2019re definitely NTA and you and your husband need to communicate about this.\n\nBest of luck to you!", "Update: I DO communicate my frustrations with him but he genuinely thinks I am over-reacting and none of this is a big deal. I think it'd be better off taking these trips with my friends rather than him. I just want to make memories and add some fun into our lives but I don't know that it's worth my time and effort anymore if this is how he reacts.", "INFO - does he actually want to go on these trips? Does he have any input into when / how / what you do?", "NTA but you should communicate your feelings to him. If you don\u2019t talk to him then he won\u2019t understand how you feel and he won\u2019t change. He probably gets annoyed because from his POV you\u2019re having an attitude for \u201cno reason\u201d. Communication is key.", "NTA but I would tell him how you\u2019re feeling unappreciated regarding the booking, planning and organisational load and find out if he\u2019s still loves the mini trips as much as he used to. There\u2019s loads of things I had the will and energy for in my 20s, that I just find a chore in my late 30s. However you\u2019re forgetting about the extra \u201cman time\u201d needing added on to your schedule. (Similar to \u201cwomen time\u201d but with less uniformity) For example: woman time...+ 30mins for trying on every outfit in the wardrobe, then re-ironing the one you picked last night . Man time: +anything from 10mins-3hrs for needing a poo 3 secs before departure then while walking to the car, agreeing to help the neighbours paint their 7ft fence. Always add man time, there\u2019s also child time but if focused on that too much, you won\u2019t be going out at all!", "NTA. Yes, like the others said, communicate openly. State clearly that you're not willing to let things continue like this and that you won't continue planning these trips if they do. If things don't change, stop doing all the work and remind him why. He's of course welcome to plan himself. Some people don't change until they face consequences.", "NTA\n\nI have similar problems with my wife: she thinks a trip is just \"get in the car and drive\" and packing for trip \"put everything in the car\". We are regularly late so I break speed limits to try to get on time and sometimes can't see thru rearview mirror due to her stuff.\n\nNot to mention when I start planning I get comments like \"You always take out the fun\" just because I want to avoid tourist rush.\n\nI managed to get her to stop taking stuff we won't use, but lateness is a different problem. I  stopped speeding and let her deal with being late, which helped a little.\n\nNot sure what to say about your problem. He won't change. You can relax and accept it, break with him or just start going on trips alone/without him.", "ESH. You need to stop planning the trips. Let him do the work and be invested in the plan (and stop taking your effort for granted). He's being passive-aggressive, and it's not a coincidence he's acting like he doesn't want to go on the trip: he doesn't. You both together have created this toxic dynamic where no one is having any fun.", "I think NTA but talk to your husband. You need to communicate and find the core of the problem. It looks like you have some really different attitudes right now. \n\nI want to give an example of what may be the problem from my personal experience. No judgment here, just another point of view. A backstory. I myself love traveling and road trips, with my ex bf we did quite a lot while we've been together. So the thing is for both of us these trips were something fun to do, that's why we decided that they shouldn't be associated with any chores (cleaning, laundry, etc) and shouldn't be strictly tied to some schedule. We often were going for trips during weekends, so it was usually 1-3 days trip. All the necessary chores were done beforehand (let's say we decided to go Saturday morning, this means that everything should be done Friday evening or earlier) but if we didn't finish - it's fine, we can clean our stove when we return, nobody will die. Same with schedule - yes, sure, if we wanted to see the sunset from one particular hill we had to calculate timing, but we always were putting some extra hours, so we are not in a rush, with that we either could stop somewhere nice to spend extra time or have a pick nick while waiting or just arrive on time if there were some complications or we woke up late. A couple of times it happened that we screwed the timing... Well, it's fine, happens, just a quick change of plans and choosing our second option (restaurant, another town nearby, something else), but we never blamed each other. And we were always having plan B, there was a list of things that we wanted to do, but with some variations, so it was always possible to choose or adopt depending on circumstances. So the key was to make our trips fun and absolutely not stressful. So there were no chores during the day of the trip, no strict planning and always a plan b. Plus, we never blamed each other, because it was kind of the whole point to have great time together. We tried once to go with a real planning... It went bad, we got stressed, quicker, quicker, hurry... We liked to chill. Just casually enjoy the day and each other without any PLAN above our heads. So maybe that's the case with your husband? Maybe you could talk something through or adopt some of my experience? Thanks for reading :)", "Omg NTA He is being very inconsiderate and selfish.", "UPDATE 2: y'all, I don't mean a real set time but a very flimsy set time like \"around 4 or around 2\" I also don't have a strict schedule when I plan trips. Just a general idea of things we can do, but stores and activities aren't always open past 8!", "Info: when are you going to realize he really doesn't like these road trips?", "NAH. It's clear that these trips mean a lot to you, but maybe he's just not wired the same way. Try having an open conversation about how you both can make these road trips enjoyable for each other.", "NTA. Sounds like he's just a dick.", "Men are like that.\nWe women seem to think and plan overall while men always take their time.\nSometimes we just need to relax and let them take their time or we tell them what to do.\n\nI would recommend talking with him and tell him your point of veiw if there is cases you come late.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

What's the big difference between pulling in at 7pm and pulling in at 6pm?\n\nYour two different mindsets are conflicting, but what should just be a minor issue where you two compromise to meet in the middle seems to have become him planting down his figurative flag and refusing to budge. Meanwhile you remind and baby him every step of the way which has got to be annoying. So I think OP you should take a step back and stop with the reminders--you two need to talk extensively about this and how you feel, of course, but as part of you agreeing not to rush him so much you need to also make it clear that if he refuses to get ready he'll either have to come as he is or stay home.\n\nMaybe if he doesn't have a toothbrush or clothes for a few trips he'll start being more prepared in the future.", "NTA.

Maybe if u directly ask him to be Involved then he will understand what needs to be done\nMore effectively then u doing it and him wasting time as u see it. Wish u both the best of luck", "NTA but trust me when your partner gets tunnel vision and harps on you it gets old really fast. I dont dilly dally but im not gonna freak out if we dont leave on time. He, on the other hand, is very tense and rushy. Its annoying. My favorite trips are the ones i take alone because no one is rushing me. You two have different expectations and need to work that out with communication.", "Yea hes like me. Stop the trips. If he wants to do something let him plan it. I dont like rushing around and enjoy going places alone because i can go at my own pace.", "I think the issue here is that you're waiting to start your holiday till you get to your destination, he starts the moment he wakes up that day. If he always does it, plan for it.", "Maybe this is part of the issue. Maybe a set time would work better.", "Doesnt this make things worse? If you want to leave by a certain time make it a set time.", "I hear your sentiments and would typically agree but \ud83d\ude2d I know he has a hard time focusing so I don't want to \"punish\" him out of a trip because he's dilly dallying. I would feel so bad and he would feel challenged, I'm afraid he might make a point not to go if he felt challenged. But I appreciate your advice.", "Gah, it's so hard!! Thanks for your advice. It just fucks me up because if I set an ultimatum like that I'm afraid he will feel challenged and just not go out of spite \ud83d\ude2d I don't want him to feel like my time is more important than his etc. I feel like I'll be too hurt to have a great time \ud83e\udd72 a sensitive bitch Ugh.", "No she shouldn't stop the trips. She should stop inviting him. Her life shouldn't be curtailed because he doesn't want something.", "Someone is going to be \u201cpunished\u201d by missing out on the trip you planned regardless. Currently, it\u2019s *you* being punished every single time, for something he\u2019s doing/not doing. \n\nIs he gainfully employed? Is he late every day, or can he make it on time? Does he complete tasks accurately and on time? Is he constantly on the verge of being fired because he\u2019s slacking at work? He went back to school for higher education, did struggle with that, or was he able to pass? \n\nIf he\u2019s hopeless like this in all areas of his life, he needs to get that checked out and under control. If he\u2019s not then maybe it\u2019s stop giving him a pass on this issue, and stop taking the fall for his decision to screw around when it\u2019s something you\u2019re excited for.", "Seriously it does sound as if it may be worth checking. Might give you both a different perspective. If it is then there are strategies which can make things easier. ( I have a cousin who is incapable of being less than an hour late - I either tell her the wrong time or turn up an hour late myself)", "Look up ADHD \u201ctime blindness\u201d and see whether that sounds familiar.", "Oh i mean thats what i meant. I meant stop the trips with him. Sorry my bad.", "This would be my approach as well. If he is leaving the planning to you then he needs to adhere to your plan, which involves a certain leave time. I would just leave without him, but I love solo trips lol.", "Lol holy can't take criticism huh?", "I must have missed the criticism part...just sounded like you nitpicked, sounded patronising and chastising to prove some gender point. Sounds like a you problem luv.", "He won't plan those either. I have saved for bigger trips: I planned our honeymoon in Mexico and a trip to San Francisco as well. I appreciate your input tho.", "Nta. \n\nHis behavior is disrespectful.  Prior to the trip, discuss with him and agree upon a departure time. Advise him you are leaving if he is not ready by the departure time. When the day comes, give him an extra few minutes,  but if he isn't ready on time, LEAVE HIM BEHIND.", "NTA and stop planning trips. Tell him the next one is his responsibility or just go away with your friends.", "My husband is exactly like this ! But he genuinely thinks he has it under control, so me even saying gentle reminders is annoying to him If a time is absolutely needed to be stuck too, I just tell him the wrong time, so he\u2019s at his pace and I can chill without bothering him, so better start to the trip( when i remember lol)", "Here\u2019s the thing: the way you describe them, your road trips *don\u2019t* sound like much fun. You\u2019re rushing him out the door, the ride there is super tense, and for some reason you\u2019re planning activities after he just got done with a day-long drive. Maybe he likes the trips well enough but he dreads the part where he has to spend hours in the car with someone who\u2019s mad at him every single time and then get rushed off to do things before he\u2019s had a chance to decompress.\n\nI don\u2019t think you\u2019re TA but I don\u2019t think he is either. Have you tried planning trips based on who you both are, and not who you think you both ought to be? Building a buffer into travel time so it doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re late? Not planning activities until the next morning? Because unfortunately you\u2019re not building fond memories here. You\u2019re building memories of two pissed-off people each being pissed off about the same thing, every time, and apparently no one wondering if there isn\u2019t a better way to build memories that doesn\u2019t involve a vehicular cold war.", "1. Yes, you should totally suggest he gets tested for adhd\n\n2. \"He thinks none of this is a big deal.\" it's more that none of this is a big deal to him, and he's not grasping why it is to you. \n\nI know that seems like saying the same thing, but from your perspective this is a huge deal, very important, and you think/ feel that's obvious and he's just blatantly ignoring and disrespecting you. But it's not *objectively* a big deal. It isn't going to be obvious, he's not missing giant cues from the universe-his brain does not prioritize in the same way yours does (and if he has adhd, even if he knows all the reasons why you feel it's a big deal, he still may not be able to act on that). \n\nTo you, this is priority 1. You are wasting your day if you don't get there on time. If you \"looked through his eyes,\" it would be priority non-existent, it's not a necessity. From his perspective, you have some arbitrary, non important goal that you want to force him to meet, at the cost of actually being able to have a good trip. (Again, if it's adhd, treatment can help, but it is not going to make something he sees as completely irrelevant into something important. It will just make him more capable of not getting lost in his own head or tasks) To him, you think if you guys aren't there on time the world is ending, and he's just trying to actually have a good time in spite of that stress. \n\nFrom an adhd person who has had this issue with family members- it has ruined multiple family vacations for me.\nI was going to give a personal example, even had it typed out, but realized it might only make sense to me. Suffice to say, the stress of expectations that I've never found important, and no one can explain fully to my satisfaction, and being forced to go against my brain and fight every step of the way because of some idea that there's an \"on time\" during my time off (among other things) has made me dread family vacations. It's literally ruined entire trips for me. \n\nHe should get tested, but you both might also need to reset some expectations about trips in the furore.", "Next time you take a trip let him know when you plan it what the expectations are.  Tell him that the luggage AND the car needs to be fully packed the night before and you will both wake up and get into the car at X time.  Tell him in order for YOU to enjoy the vacation that it is totally non-negotiable to do these things and if he cannot stick to the schedule then you won't plan any more trips with him and only with your friends because he can't make a minimal effort when you have planned anything else.  Don't let him have any expectation of free time the day you leave - you both wake up at the same time and get right in the car and leave - bring granola bars for breakfast or something similar.  I think letting him have any time in the morning is a mistake.", "\"The Way Up to Heaven\" by Roald Dahl. Amazing story.", "The rides never take longer than 3 hours and usually under that \ud83e\udd72 he knows these trips are one day trips because they're so close... I check in with him weeks before and then the day of to see if he's still feeling it. Usually when we get to our destination we take the first 2 hours to chill at our hotel and eat food, so I don't feel that I rush him to do anything when we get there.", "Honestly if for some wild crazy reason you continue to decide to plan these trips, tell him to leave at a time much earlier than you actually need to leave at. (Ie. If you need to leave at noon tell him 9-10)", "You are afraid of hurting his feelings. Makes sense.\n\nBut what about your feelings? He's been completely disregarding and disrespecting them for what sounds like years maybe?\n\nRemember it's you guys vs the problem. Not you vs him. Remind him that you are on his side and you just want to build memories and have a fulfilling life together. Asking for his 10% to your 90% it not unreasonable. It's healthy.", "I switched from set times to more loose schedule because he's a lot more lax than I am \ud83e\udd72", "OP, I don\u2019t think he actually enjoys them. Don\u2019t plan another one and see what happens. Trust his ACTIONS, not his words.", "I have ADHD and I can struggle with time management. I just want to say that even if your husband does have ADHD, it doesn\u2019t give him a free pass. He would do more if he cared more. It doesn\u2019t sound like he\u2019s even trying.", "If he's like this in general, yeah (like it can happen if you're going out for other stuff or other add/ADHD stuff). If he is *only* doing this for the trips then I'd wonder if he's having anxiety about the trips (or just doesn't like them).", "Fixing or recognizing the time blindness from ADD/ADHD isn't going to fix the fact that he insists you're over reacting for sharing your frustrations.", "My first thought reading this post was ADHD.", "My thoughts exactly. I think he's \"lighting up\" and going along with things because he doesn't want to disappoint OP. (My husband is much the same way.) But deep down he doesn't really want to do this, and it's emerging in the behaviors and attitudes listed.", "Maybe he hopes (against the all facts ;) ) that THIS TIME it will be at least some fun?   \nMy SO and I are always into seeing as much, as we can on our trips, but I can understand that someone just wants to \"chill out\" and enjoy the lazy free time.", "But the whole \"building memories\" thing now seems like memories of stress, anger and bad communication.   \nCould you, just once, make an experiment and focus on you two and your good mood and feelings, not on \"the places we must see/reach\"? I mean - have \"lousy schedule\", don't act like it's the end of the world, if you two don't see that attraction or \"important place\", that's not the end of the world.   \nSet up \"the leaving time\", but don't push. Be patient and wait and see, what happen. If you have had something planned, just \"let it go\" - you won't see it this time, not a big problem.   \nPack the car cooler with some good food, snacks and drinks. You can even pack a pair of sleeping bags, if things go really lousy ;). Be prepared for \"unexpected\"things, like restaurants and shops closed or no hotel in the 3 hour radius.  \nDon't push and see, what happen. Maybe the relaxed, easy, with nothing particular \"to do\" trip could create happier memories than those from \"the places\"?   \nOne condition - you must genuinely want to relax and don't feel annoyed, when another thing to do or see falls off your list.   \nAll in all it is about making you two happy together, not about make some insta photos or following the schedule.   \nMaybe he genuinely likes to go to these trips with you, but doesn't care about the places, because just being with you on the trip makes him happy? Maybe it's worth to give it a try?"]}
