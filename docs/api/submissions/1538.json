You\u2019re not required to offer someone a stay in your home, it\u2019s generous to do.  That said, you said your brother doesn\u2019t want it either, so it\u2019s not even a question about being generous or not.  Your family doesn\u2019t want it, your brother\u2019s family doesn\u2019t want it.  You offered your parents an alternative to stay with you instead.  I think that\u2019s very fair.", "NTA omg having 2 adults & 4 children move in is a preposterous, even ludicrous idea. Your wife\u2019s suggestion is gracious & should be acceptable.", "NTA. Your parents bit off more than they could chew, but this is not your problem. Adding six people to your household, one who is disabled and one who's working but not keeping up with expenses, means you may never get them out.", "NTA.  You don't have to offer them your home.

I'm  guessing your parents are feeling some sort of strain (for whatever reason) with your brother  and his family living with them.  It doesn't mean they get  to pass them off to you.  You have offered a great compromise, if they don't take it then that's up to them.", "NTA. You offered a very reasonable compromise. Their loss.", "NTA. You haven't seen each other once in seven years. I wouldn't want to have him and his family live with me either.", "NTA. Family means more than just DNA. I have friends I would turn to for help before turning to some members of my \"family.\" Offering to let your parents come was, as others have mentioned, a decent compromise. \n*If* you do want to help, and/or want to promote a better relationship with his kids than you have with your brother, it would be (and should be recognized as) a nice gesture to take the kids for a weekend. It's probably a real trial for them, and they have the least level of control over their circumstances. Or even an afternoon outing. But this is a suggestion, by no means a requirement.

I think offering for your parents to stay with you for a while is a great solution. You\u2018d be helping out family without sharing a home with people who are basically strangers.", "NTA. Family takes work and effort to maintain just like friendships. You probably know more about your local grocer than your brother at this point. Is it sad you don\u2019t have a closer relationship? Yeah, but life happens and just because you share genetic material doesn\u2019t mean that you guys are genetically predisposed to get along or be close. \n\nI understand your parents frustration, but this isn\u2019t for you to put you and your brother in a position neither of you would be happy with to make them happy. Your offer for them to stay instead was reasonable and generous, but their response is telling that it\u2019s less about them needing space and more about them wanting THIER space again.", "Nta.

You don't even know him", "NTA. \n\nYou all are grownups and take care of yourselves. \n\nBrother should find himself a cheaper place to live if the current living situation is not convenient. \n\nMoreover, you asked your parents to move in for a while.

You\u2019d all be miserable and it wouldn\u2019t take long.\n\nAnd your brother isn\u2019t being fair  to your parents - he should have found a place for his family. He should have been looking or saving up for a place.\n\nStand firm- tell your parents that they are more than welcome to stay with you but not your brother and his family.", "NTA.
