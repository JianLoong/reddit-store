You have so much more to lose, as much as I love my brother and would do anything for him, if I was in your position I would not make that sacrifice. \n\nIf things are better where you are now, it would make more sense to get your sister to come live in assisted living closer to you, so your family unit remains safe and secure and your sister is also somewhere she can be looked after adequately, somewhere you are able to go see her more often as well.

It's safer if the day to day care people are properly trained and it's safer for a responsible family member to supervise, even from a distance. \n\nYou can be a huge support and work to keep her safe without tanking the life you have built. \n\nBut lay it out for your mom now - if your sister needs a placement it will be better to have your mom select it and ease her in while things are calm rather than waiting for someone to die or become incapable of care.", "Except the mom is the AH. Yes, caretaking is a challenging job, and kudos to her for taking it on. But the mom decided when OP was a child that she was responsible for her sister and pushed that to the point that OP internalized it so much she thought she would never have a spouse or children of her own and still thinks she will have to move internationally to care for her sister. She emotionally neglected OP as well. And now she's refusing to take advantage of resources that are available, which isn't just hurting OP with the weight of expectation, but will also hurt the sister in the future. \n\nIt will be much easier for the sister if caretakers are introduced now so it's not a sudden change when Mom dies. It will be much easier if sister transitions to a group home soon so that moving there isn't associated with her mom's death in her head. ***IF*** OP decides to take in her sister, it will be much easier to have visited the place where OP lives. And, honestly, I'm not sure mom is doing the best thing for the sister now either. With how OP talked about her sister being able to do tasks independently but never being exposed to an environment without mom, it sounds like mom is holding sister back instead of helping her learn to function as independently as she can. \n\nMom is a major AH, and taking responsibility *for her own child* doesn't negate that.", "You live in another country now so it is not practical. This was never your responsibility. This was something that your mom needed to figure out.", "NTA. She's practically a stranger to you, you have your own family now, and it's not your problem.

You go right ahead and refuse.  The life of a full time carer is brutally hard and you have no obligation to undertake it here.  This is your sister, not your child.  No matter how much your mother screams and guilts and abuses you, YOU ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR YOUR SISTER.  Please look in your mirrror and repeat that phrase 3 times every morning until it sinks into your soul.  If you chose to take on caring for your sister from a position of ability and desire to do so, that is your choice.

We prefer not to have family care for us as it causes all sorts of issues.", "I do agree with this statement but hopefully they can avoid a group home situation at all costs. Those places are truly awful \ud83d\ude1e Unfortunately group homes are nothing more than dumping grounds for the disabled when they either have no one who can/is willing to care for them. This whole situation is very sad, hopefully OP and family can work it out.", "No, YWNBTA, but as a person who has lived this experience, please listen when I tell you that you cannot sound indecisive when you have this conversation.\n\nIt\u2019s not, \u201cI don\u2019t want\u2026\u201d. \nIt has to be, \u201cI will not\u2026\u201d\n\nYou don\u2019t offer explanations or justifications for why you won\u2019t be responsible for your sister.

You simply tell her that your decision is final and that the state will have to step in if she fails to plan appropriately.\n\nThe key here is your sounding firm and unequivocal.  Your mom has to believe you mean it and you are not an option.  Your sister should be put on a waiting list for a group home and transitioned while your mother is still alive to help her manage the separation.\n\nYour mother is going to call you every name in the book and will try to guilt you into caving.  If she starts down that path, you have to repeat that you\u2019re not having the discussion and then hang up.  Rinse, repeat.\n\nGood luck.", "NTA - I grew up with a severely disabled family member, and it's hell. Especially if they struggle to build relationships due to their disabilities.\n\nHere's a different way of viewing this situation that might alleviate your guilt. **I do not believe it is your responsibility to care for your sister,** but you seem to so let's assume it is.  What does that responsibility mean?  I means making sure your sister is looked after in the best possible way, that she is happy, cared for, in a loving place and receiving the best medical care she can.  It means that you have the power to make those informed decisions for her.\n\n**It does not mean you doing all of the care work yourself.**\n\nIf your sister is \"your responsibility\" *(again, I do not believe she is)* then you are also responsible for deciding **HOW** to care for her.\n\nYour mother is currently making all the decisions for your sister.  She is fully responsible for her, and so can choose to care for her in anyway she deems best.  She is expecting to continue making the decisions, but you will be doing the work.  **That isn't making you** ***responsible*** **for your sister, that is making you your mother's obedient servant.**\n\nResponsibility isn't just about the burden of the care work - it is about choosing the right care.  And I don't believe that you caring for your sister will be right for either of you - you have been gone for 16 years, don't know how to care for her, have virtually no relationship with her. She doesn't know you, wouldn't handle moving to a new country well.\n\nThis isn't a black or white situation either - there are ways you can oversee your sister's care without complete displacing your own family and ruining yourselves financially.  But if your mother won't accept any compromise then you don't really have any options.\n\nYou also have more important relationships that your are responsible for now - your children and husband.  It is not OK to put your sister above your own children. At this point you need to be very clear in your head what you can offer, and be very brave and speak to your mother. Good luck.", "She's most definitely not your responsibility just because someone declares it so.

You need to decide who you want to prioritise.  I can only imagine the trauma and guilt you feel given how you grew up.
