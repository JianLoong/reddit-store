My sister has high functioning autism with a severe speech delay. While she can do some daily tasks by herself, she has never been exposed to an environment where she has not lived with my mother or not had help. As resources were limited when we were growing up, she also hasn't had the opportunity to manage herself in social settings. Long story short, she does need constant caretaking. \n\nMy mother always insisted that I was responsible for my sister after her. I grew up thinking that I wouldn't get married or have kids to avoid burdening another person with my responsibility. Throughout my childhood I did feel like my mother wanted me around to mainly be the primary caretaker of my sister. I did feel neglected as my mother's main focus was my sister and her boyfriend and I was reeling with trying to understand my purpose in a broken family. My mother has definitely been through a lot but I felt like I didn't really get to voice my feelings \n\nFast forward to now, life took a different turn. I moved out when I was 17 and now have a wonderful family. It's everything that I could have wished for and gives me immense happiness. My sister and I have drifted apart as I've been away for 16yrs now and due to her speech delay we only converse a few sentences once in a while. I have asked my mother to try and bring my sister to my country of residence but she refuses to try. I understand it would be difficult but I can only visit them once in a couple of years due to my job and i feel like we don't really know each other anymore. \n\nBringing me to my problem - I don't know if I can look after her now. We are almost like just acquaintances. As my mother refuses to take her out of her country, this would mean that when the time comes, I'll have to uproot myself. It would also disrupt the life we live right now and want to lead in the future. It will definitely have a financial strain on us as well.

If you do uproot yourself, you risk ruining the lives of yourself and your family for your sister, it doesn't make logical sense. I get why you feel she is your responsibility, because like I got told, they have no one else to look after them once your parents are gone and they're family. I do not have a family of my own so it is only my life I am sacrificing for my brother right now. You have so much more to lose, as much as I love my brother and would do anything for him, if I was in your position I would not make that sacrifice. \n\nIf things are better where you are now, it would make more sense to get your sister to come live in assisted living closer to you, so your family unit remains safe and secure and your sister is also somewhere she can be looked after adequately, somewhere you are able to go see her more often as well. It doesn't have to be right away, but definitely look into if now before your mom is out of the picture so you have some assistance from where ever they currently are.", "No OP she is NOT your responsibility. You mom and stepdad drilled that BS into your head for so many years but it's just that,BS. They can't neglect you and raise you only to use you as a caregiver when the time comes. Don't feel the pressure. Just focus on your REAL family.", "This line definitely stuck out to me too.  Your Mom probably means well.  But, OP, you listed like 50 reasons why you can\u2019t be her caretaker.  The only person you need to convince is yourself.  Once you come to terms with the fact that you don\u2019t have to do this, tell your mother.  Be honest.  Be frank.  Tell her you have made your decision and you are sharing that decision so that she can make other arrangements.", "Thank you for your comments. I've broached this topic in the past but unfortunately my mother gets very sensitive about it. She feels like hiring someone to take care of my sister (like live in carers or so) is like abandoning my responsibility. In all honesty, we've not talked about this in detail as I've been afraid to ruffle feathers. I'm going to try again.", "I\u2019m sorry but how can you say the mother is not an ah, she doesn\u2019t get to put her others child care on OP at any age.\nYou get that right", "I like the advice that OP should come to terms with this first. There\u2019s no time pressure right now and if she approaches her mother while still torn we know which side her mum will take.", "It's an incredibly difficult discussion that will probably take a lot of time and revisiting, I feel for you.", "Your sister is NOT your responsibility your children are though", "NTA\n\nshe is not your responsibility, she is your sister. No one can expect you to uproot your husband and children, drag them away from friends and family just so your sister is taken care of. You told your mother to move your sister to your country and she denies. She takes matters out of your hands. You become your sister NOW while you decide to become her keeper or your mother has to find a keeper at their place.", "INFO - why is your half-sister's father not in the equation?  Does he have family that could help?", "NTA.\n\nYes, caring for a disabled child is difficult, I get that. However, your mother is bang out of order for putting that much pressure on you growing up. My heart broke for you reading that you initially felt you couldn\u2019t have a family or life of your own. That isn\u2019t good parenting on her part. As much as she might not have set out to do so, she has chose to prioritise one child over an other. She robbed you of your childhood, OP, please don\u2019t let her rob you of anything else.", "There are homes where your sister would be much happier than with you. She'd be around peers and the staff that enters this profession are usually very dedicated - and they get time off. They don't end up with carers burnout. I used to work in one of these places and the residents were very happy and well cared for! \n\nNTA. You are not equipped to deal with her long-term and what you mothers envisions happening is a horrible plan.", "Nta. You have a greater responsibility to your family and to yourself.  If moving country harms them you shouldn't do it. If becoming a full time carer destroys your family life you shouldn't do it. Your mother has no right to force this choice on you.\n\nYour mother needs to make other arrangements.  It would be kinder to your sister to make your mother face this fact. For your sister's you need to stand up to your mother.", "NTA \n\nYou need to ask your mother what she would do if you were in an accident and became physically/mentally disabled? Would she still expect you to do this?  What she is asking you to do will financially, emotionally, spiritually disable your family in much the same way. \n\nYes you have responsibilities; to your children, to your husband, to yourself. After your mother is gone you will have a responsibility to oversee your sister\u2019s care. To make sure she is being cared for. To advocate for her as best you can. But the physical day to day is not your responsibility.", "NTA she is not your responsibility. End of.", "Yes.  You need to be clear and consistent with your mother.   Otherwise,  she's not going to make another plan.   Start now.   Give her plenty of time to come to terms with the situation.", "I get that it\u2019s a hard discussion.  But none of you is getting any younger.  You need to be direct and insistent that she come up with a plan for when she\u2019s gone.  Or she will NOT make a plan, and you\u2019ll end up having to make one while grieving your mother (and possibly make an emotional choice that you rationally don\u2019t want to make).  Offer to be involved in the process of researching facilities, etc. with your mom.", "Hon would you force one of your children to bear the responsibility of another if the second would be in your sister s situation? \n\nAnswer this to yourself would it be your other child responsibility in your eyes ( not what you wish but wou you put that responsibility on your child) ?\n\n If your answer is no , as it should be,  then this tells you clearly it's not your responsibility either. \n\nLet your mother know you won't destroy your children and husband lifes to take care of your sister and that she needs to start making arrangements for your sister ASAP. NTA", "I'm a professional caregiver and I have to say your mom is failing her responsibility by denying your sister professional help."]}
