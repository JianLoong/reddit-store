My parents separated when I was around 10 (they never got along and my mom had an extra marital affair). My mother and my sister (27F) live together with my Stepdad (same guy) in another country. My sister has high functioning autism with a severe speech delay. While she can do some daily tasks by herself, she has never been exposed to an environment where she has not lived with my mother or not had help. As resources were limited when we were growing up, she also hasn't had the opportunity to manage herself in social settings. Long story short, she does need constant caretaking. \n\nMy mother always insisted that I was responsible for my sister after her. I grew up thinking that I wouldn't get married or have kids to avoid burdening another person with my responsibility. Throughout my childhood I did feel like my mother wanted me around to mainly be the primary caretaker of my sister. I did feel neglected as my mother's main focus was my sister and her boyfriend and I was reeling with trying to understand my purpose in a broken family. My mother has definitely been through a lot but I felt like I didn't really get to voice my feelings \n\nFast forward to now, life took a different turn. I moved out when I was 17 and now have a wonderful family. It's everything that I could have wished for and gives me immense happiness. My sister and I have drifted apart as I've been away for 16yrs now and due to her speech delay we only converse a few sentences once in a while. I have asked my mother to try and bring my sister to my country of residence but she refuses to try. I understand it would be difficult but I can only visit them once in a couple of years due to my job and i feel like we don't really know each other anymore. \n\nBringing me to my problem - I don't know if I can look after her now. We are almost like just acquaintances. As my mother refuses to take her out of her country, this would mean that when the time comes, I'll have to uproot myself. It would also disrupt the life we live right now and want to lead in the future. It will definitely have a financial strain on us as well.

That said, it is also fine if you do not want to take that life-changing responsibility on yourself. I can understand your mother's fear surrounding who will care for her child when she is gone.

If you do uproot yourself, you risk ruining the lives of yourself and your family for your sister, it doesn't make logical sense. I get why you feel she is your responsibility, because like I got told, they have no one else to look after them once your parents are gone and they're family. I do not have a family of my own so it is only my life I am sacrificing for my brother right now. You have so much more to lose, as much as I love my brother and would do anything for him, if I was in your position I would not make that sacrifice. \n\nIf things are better where you are now, it would make more sense to get your sister to come live in assisted living closer to you, so your family unit remains safe and secure and your sister is also somewhere she can be looked after adequately, somewhere you are able to go see her more often as well. It doesn't have to be right away, but definitely look into if now before your mom is out of the picture so you have some assistance from where ever they currently are.", "No OP she is NOT your responsibility. You mom and stepdad drilled that BS into your head for so many years but it's just that,BS. They can't neglect you and raise you only to use you as a caregiver when the time comes. Don't feel the pressure. Just focus on your REAL family.", "This line definitely stuck out to me too.  Your Mom probably means well.  But, OP, you listed like 50 reasons why you can\u2019t be her caretaker.  The only person you need to convince is yourself.  Once you come to terms with the fact that you don\u2019t have to do this, tell your mother.  Be honest.  Be frank.  Tell her you have made your decision and you are sharing that decision so that she can make other arrangements.", "Thank you for your comments. I've broached this topic in the past but unfortunately my mother gets very sensitive about it. She feels like hiring someone to take care of my sister (like live in carers or so) is like abandoning my responsibility. In all honesty, we've not talked about this in detail as I've been afraid to ruffle feathers. I'm going to try again.", "I\u2019m sorry but how can you say the mother is not an ah, she doesn\u2019t get to put her others child care on OP at any age.\nYou get that right", "I like the advice that OP should come to terms with this first. There\u2019s no time pressure right now and if she approaches her mother while still torn we know which side her mum will take.", "It's an incredibly difficult discussion that will probably take a lot of time and revisiting, I feel for you.", "Your sister is NOT your responsibility your children are though"]}
