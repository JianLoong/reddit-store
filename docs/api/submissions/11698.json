If you do uproot yourself, you risk ruining the lives of yourself and your family for your sister, it doesn't make logical sense. I get why you feel she is your responsibility, because like I got told, they have no one else to look after them once your parents are gone and they're family. I do not have a family of my own so it is only my life I am sacrificing for my brother right now. You have so much more to lose, as much as I love my brother and would do anything for him, if I was in your position I would not make that sacrifice. \n\nIf things are better where you are now, it would make more sense to get your sister to come live in assisted living closer to you, so your family unit remains safe and secure and your sister is also somewhere she can be looked after adequately, somewhere you are able to go see her more often as well. It doesn't have to be right away, but definitely look into if now before your mom is out of the picture so you have some assistance from where ever they currently are.", "No OP she is NOT your responsibility. You mom and stepdad drilled that BS into your head for so many years but it's just that,BS. They can't neglect you and raise you only to use you as a caregiver when the time comes. Don't feel the pressure. Just focus on your REAL family.", "This line definitely stuck out to me too.  Your Mom probably means well.  But, OP, you listed like 50 reasons why you can\u2019t be her caretaker.  The only person you need to convince is yourself.  Once you come to terms with the fact that you don\u2019t have to do this, tell your mother.  Be honest.  Be frank.  Tell her you have made your decision and you are sharing that decision so that she can make other arrangements.", "Thank you for your comments. I've broached this topic in the past but unfortunately my mother gets very sensitive about it. She feels like hiring someone to take care of my sister (like live in carers or so) is like abandoning my responsibility. In all honesty, we've not talked about this in detail as I've been afraid to ruffle feathers. I'm going to try again.", "I\u2019m sorry but how can you say the mother is not an ah, she doesn\u2019t get to put her others child care on OP at any age.\nYou get that right", "I like the advice that OP should come to terms with this first. There\u2019s no time pressure right now and if she approaches her mother while still torn we know which side her mum will take.", "It's an incredibly difficult discussion that will probably take a lot of time and revisiting, I feel for you.", "Your sister is NOT your responsibility your children are though", "NTA\n\nshe is not your responsibility, she is your sister. No one can expect you to uproot your husband and children, drag them away from friends and family just so your sister is taken care of. You told your mother to move your sister to your country and she denies. She takes matters out of your hands. You become your sister NOW while you decide to become her keeper or your mother has to find a keeper at their place.", "INFO - why is your half-sister's father not in the equation?  Does he have family that could help?", "NTA.\n\nYes, caring for a disabled child is difficult, I get that. However, your mother is bang out of order for putting that much pressure on you growing up. My heart broke for you reading that you initially felt you couldn\u2019t have a family or life of your own. That isn\u2019t good parenting on her part. As much as she might not have set out to do so, she has chose to prioritise one child over an other. She robbed you of your childhood, OP, please don\u2019t let her rob you of anything else.", "There are homes where your sister would be much happier than with you. She'd be around peers and the staff that enters this profession are usually very dedicated - and they get time off. They don't end up with carers burnout. I used to work in one of these places and the residents were very happy and well cared for! \n\nNTA. You are not equipped to deal with her long-term and what you mothers envisions happening is a horrible plan.", "Nta. You have a greater responsibility to your family and to yourself.  If moving country harms them you shouldn't do it. If becoming a full time carer destroys your family life you shouldn't do it. Your mother has no right to force this choice on you.\n\nYour mother needs to make other arrangements.  It would be kinder to your sister to make your mother face this fact. For your sister's you need to stand up to your mother.", "NTA \n\nYou need to ask your mother what she would do if you were in an accident and became physically/mentally disabled? Would she still expect you to do this?  What she is asking you to do will financially, emotionally, spiritually disable your family in much the same way. \n\nYes you have responsibilities; to your children, to your husband, to yourself. After your mother is gone you will have a responsibility to oversee your sister\u2019s care. To make sure she is being cared for. To advocate for her as best you can. But the physical day to day is not your responsibility.", "NTA she is not your responsibility. End of.", "Yes.  You need to be clear and consistent with your mother.   Otherwise,  she's not going to make another plan.   Start now.   Give her plenty of time to come to terms with the situation.", "I get that it\u2019s a hard discussion.  But none of you is getting any younger.  You need to be direct and insistent that she come up with a plan for when she\u2019s gone.  Or she will NOT make a plan, and you\u2019ll end up having to make one while grieving your mother (and possibly make an emotional choice that you rationally don\u2019t want to make).  Offer to be involved in the process of researching facilities, etc. with your mom.", "Hon would you force one of your children to bear the responsibility of another if the second would be in your sister s situation? \n\nAnswer this to yourself would it be your other child responsibility in your eyes ( not what you wish but wou you put that responsibility on your child) ?\n\n If your answer is no , as it should be,  then this tells you clearly it's not your responsibility either. \n\nLet your mother know you won't destroy your children and husband lifes to take care of your sister and that she needs to start making arrangements for your sister ASAP.

She is your mother\u2019s responsibility and one that she has utterly failed. Your poor sister could have been prepared for the world to at least live in a group/assisted living home.\n\nRealistically, she should be in a form of group home that encourages her to work outside of it and gives her social exposure.\n\nNTA", "She is not your responsibility. Your only responsibility is your kids and husband . Best of luck", "NTA she is not your responsibility. That responsibility is solely on her parents. I'd speak up now so they know your stance and can find long term care when the time comes. It's not fair you were brought up and made to believe you have to put yourself aside for your sister care. That's wrong. When they call you selfish and they will, ask them when in any of this has anyone thought of the impact it will have on your life. You have so be selfish as I'm sure you don't want to make your kids feel like you did. Tell them to stop the guilt and that you will not be taking her if anything happens. Its alot to expect of anyone else.", "NTA. She is not your responsibility. She's your sister and your mother's responsibility. It's up to your mother to find a caregiver for the future.", "NTA. And your sister is _not_ your responsibility. Just because your mother has been saying this all your life doesn't make it so.", "NTA and no she isn\u2019t your responsibility. Your responsibility is your kids and spouse. Your sister is your mothers responsibility. She needs to have care set up to take care of her when she can no longer. \n\nI would let your mother that caring for her isn\u2019t your responsibility and it is time that find another care taker.

This is a small reason why my wife and I didn't have any other kids. We didn't want the temptation to try and force the responsibility of raising a disabled sibling on someone. We elected to ask my sister and brother to take over that role if something happens to us. I don't know what we'll do later on. My wife says she's not planning to ever die, which I think is a bit unrealistic.\n\nIt's not, and shouldn't be, your responsibility if you don't want it or don't think you can handle it. You don't need a reason. Your mother needs to start looking to alternatives. Other family members, group homes, etc.", "NTA, your half sister is not your responsibility. Your mother and step-father need to look into facilities that can take care of her when they are no longer able to.", "NTA\n\nYour circumstances have changed, and you aren't able to care for your sister. Period. \nYou would only be in the wrong if you didn't tell your mother so that she can begin to think about other arrangements. \nHow wonderful that you have the life you've always dreamed of.", "You have 2 toddlers to care for , mom is pretty selfish if she dumps your sister on you and she adds on to the responsibility , you have your own kids to care for and worry about , she\u2019s not your responsibility they decided to have kids , that\u2019s their daughter not yours", "There are soo many post like your own on this sub reddit. If you are still in doubt go find and read them. You are NEVER responsible for a sibling. It was your parents choice to have them. Now if you want to take care of them that is on you.. BUT you do NOT. You don't have to feel guilty for not taking them. You are allowed your life. You started your own family and they need you. So dont' burden yourself with this guilt or thinking cause shes your sister you have to do something. You don't.", "This is not OP's responsibility. She has her own life and family. Her mother can find a nice place for the sister to live where she will get 24 hour care.", "NTA. I can see it's been beaten into you from the beginning, but your sister is NOT your responsibility. You didn't give birth to her. You can do what you can, but in no way is it your job to do anything.", "NAH. Both you and your mom are viewing this as an all or nothing proposition. \n\nThere are a lot of ways you can support your sister at a distance - you can ensure her finances are handled appropriately, review her medical care, research whatever group home or placement she ends up in, send her clothing and personal care items, have medical decison making power, etc. Taking care of a person with a persistent disability isn't just day to day things. It's safer if the day to day care people are properly trained and it's safer for a responsible family member to supervise, even from a distance. \n\nYou can be a huge support and work to keep her safe without tanking the life you have built. \n\nBut lay it out for your mom now - if your sister needs a placement it will be better to have your mom select it and ease her in while things are calm rather than waiting for someone to die or become incapable of care.", "Except the mom is the AH. Yes, caretaking is a challenging job, and kudos to her for taking it on. But the mom decided when OP was a child that she was responsible for her sister and pushed that to the point that OP internalized it so much she thought she would never have a spouse or children of her own and still thinks she will have to move internationally to care for her sister. She emotionally neglected OP as well. And now she's refusing to take advantage of resources that are available, which isn't just hurting OP with the weight of expectation, but will also hurt the sister in the future. \n\nIt will be much easier for the sister if caretakers are introduced now so it's not a sudden change when Mom dies. It will be much easier if sister transitions to a group home soon so that moving there isn't associated with her mom's death in her head. ***IF*** OP decides to take in her sister, it will be much easier to have visited the place where OP lives. And, honestly, I'm not sure mom is doing the best thing for the sister now either. With how OP talked about her sister being able to do tasks independently but never being exposed to an environment without mom, it sounds like mom is holding sister back instead of helping her learn to function as independently as she can. \n\nMom is a major AH, and taking responsibility *for her own child* doesn't negate that.", "You live in another country now so it is not practical. This was never your responsibility. This was something that your mom needed to figure out."]}
