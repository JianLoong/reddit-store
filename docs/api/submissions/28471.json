They'll probably want to drop her entirely if they find out about this.", "NTA, this is a red flag. i have previously been (financially) exploited by a therapist and a good provider would not do this to you. \n\ndeciding to raise their rates are one thing, but trying to trick you into a co payment you didn\u2019t owe and asking for tips is going in the wrong direction. \n\ndon\u2019t discount your feelings of broken trust. it\u2019s kind of important on a foundation level. yes it does suck to have to look for a new therapist but staying with one you don\u2019t trust is worse.", "Wow, how unprofessional! She should renegotiate with the insurance company.  NTA", "NTA wtf!? That is wildly unethical, I absolutely would not trust her with the mental health of my child, much less myself.", "NTA not only is it absolutely a result of you saying you\u2019re finally not having money worries, but she then lied to you about it", "NTA - so, your insurance pays 100% of what the therapist charges, and they wanted a co-pay? Money on top of what they would normally charge? For one, tipping of a therapist is not a thing, secondly, if the therapist wants more money, they need to either raise their rates, or if it's in a group practice/employee situation ask for a raise or something.\n\nThe therapist was unethical in this situation, whether you have disposable income or not, and should be reported to their professional board for a breech of ethics in addition to your insurance company for attempting to \"double dip\"", "NTA that was trashy and she needs to bill the insurance for more if she wants a \"raise\". Its fine to think your time is worth more, but there are channels for this sort of thing. \n\nOne slight issue might be unilaterally cancelling the therapist your family has worked with. Your family not \"falling apart\" isn't really an indicator of her usefulness. Sounds like you are projecting how you personally feel about therapy onto your other family members. I certainly understand wanting to pursue a different therapist but maybe wait until a replacement had been secured? I dunno.", "NTA. This is actually against ethics as well and reportable.", "NTA. She was incredibly unprofessional and you did the right thing by firing her.", "NTA. Not every therapist is a good fit... some aren't good therapists.\n\nI imagine you would like to not engage in conversation with this therapist again. But if you did communicate with her, I would put it some written form and simply ask her to convey - **in writing** \\- exactly what she was saying to you (since you misunderstood) when she brought up getting a co-pay or tip from you because what she gets from insurance is not a lot and why she suddenly asked for it. If her request is perfectly ethical, then she won't mind putting it in writing.", "So did you not hear back? Or did the therapist say you misunderstood? \n\nQuite the contradiction in the last paragraph there.", "Hey, therapist here! As many people have said, very unethical how the therapist approached this. I\u2019m not very familiar with making agreements for a set small amount with insurance companies, but if they agreed to it, changing the payment plan midway through treatment is suspicious.\n\nHaving said that, I hope you find a therapist for your son, even if it\u2019s only for him and not you. If your son had a positive working relationship with this person, it abruptly went away without a transition period for a new clinician. If your son was getting something out of therapy, or can, I would urge you to reach out to more therapists because there was a reason your son was going, and broken trust with one therapist doesn\u2019t mean that you and your son are now healed.\n\nAnd as an aside, therapy isn\u2019t about holding your lives together. You make it sound like you believe therapy is about keeping you away from the end of the world. Therapy is about challenging thoughts, understanding emotions and changing behaviour, which doesn\u2019t have to be a life-changing event.\n\nNTA.", "Many therapists are going to cash only and doing away with insurance, with people willing to pay the out of pocket costs as insurance doesn\u2019t reimburse much. But this seems like she just wants a tip. NTA. If she needs to change her payment model, then she should just come out and say it. This seems like it\u2019s because you told them you make more now. Very cringe", "NTA... She is allowed to raise her rates above insurance rates as insurance is known not to change their payout for years (it rarely keeps up with cost of living) this amount is called a copay. She was wrong to liken it to tipping. If she wasnt billing and tracking it, that would be tax fraud. \n\nHer explanation and methods are suspect and it sounds like time to move on.", "So, of course the therapist was unprofessional and this sounds like something to report.\n\nHowever, you say \"we've been seeing\" ... implying that this was your son's therapist. You make it all about you, but you're leaving out an important part: your son.\n\nINFO: How does your **son** feel about this? Is he seeing another therapist?\n\nIt sounds like you're probably an AH to your son for not making reasonable arrangements to find another therapist who takes your insurance and supporting him while he's \"going through some things.\" You don't sound like you even care about him. I hope your ex at least takes him to therapy if he needs it (again, probably not with a therapist who asks for tips, you're probably not an AH for firing this one).", "ESH Firing her was the right thing do, but you are using this as an excuse to take your son out of therapy.  Your son, who is going through things, should not lose this support just because you find it a waste of time. \n\nYou don't see the point of therapy, fine, but don't use \"Our lives didn't fall apart\" as justification for keeping your son from mental health treatement that he needs. \n\nThe more i think about it the more I question if you actually did \"misunderstand\" what she was saying and spun it because you find therapy worthless.", "Report her to the state board. She should lose her license . We don\u2019t take tips, wtf? That\u2019s insane. If anything I waive copays for ppl who are struggling financially", "Run.  This is deeply unprofessional behavior from your therapist", "That is actually a specified violation of laws governing therapists. Report that therapist to their licensing board. That is verifiably trying to take advantage of a client and they shouldn\u2019t be practicing.", "NTA - report her to the insurance for fraud", "NTA You need to post this on r/end tipping.", "NTA\n\nShe is not a waiter in a restaurant who you are expected to tip. Her request is inappropriate. If she is not earning enough she needs to consider raising her fees. Not asking for cash under the table because she thinks you have extra.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nReport this to your insurance, and fire her. Trust is broken.", "NTA thats wild for a therapist to do. But eugh to your part about \"wants a raise lol\" because therapists that are paid with insurance 100% do not make enough in comparison for the work thats required, education, training, licenses, and qualifications required.", "I work in health insurance. Call your insurance company IMMEDIATELY and report her. They can take the complaint over the phone and handle everything for you. ESPECIALLY if this therapist is accepting any state-based insurance.", "ESH. The therapist was out of line. Also, it sounds like you were looking for an excuse to pull your son out of therapy. Your 'our lives haven't fallen apart' sounds aggressively defensive and dismissive of your son's actual needs. How does he feel about losing his therapist of 2 years so suddenly?", "Great job at putting your ego before your kid's needs.\n\nYou could have just said no, but had to go through this power trip.\n\nAt least you could have asked your kid's opinion about changing therapist.\n\nYTA.", "NTA.

Imagine if she did that to even two dozen clients and ten of them were paying her $20 out of pocket per week?
