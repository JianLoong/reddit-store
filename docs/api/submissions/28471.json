Its fine to think your time is worth more, but there are channels for this sort of thing. \n\nOne slight issue might be unilaterally cancelling the therapist your family has worked with.

We were pissed, they eventually gave us the option to turn this function off but not until I had two elderly patients tip 100 dollars, and it was a pain in the ass to try and get the company to refund.\n\nEdit: younger people looking to get into healthcare, really consider the choice you\u2019re making. It really is an extreme burden both emotionally and financially.", "Let's not forget that half of therapists are below average. I find it very hard to believe that a therapist grifting for tips is in that upper half.\n\nThere's a really bad therapist shortage right now and I hate to say it because it must be so discouraging to hear for people who have been waiting and hate the thought of looking again, but if you can't trust a therapist, you're probably wasting money on that one.\n\nBut just because some therapists are bad doesn't mean therapy itself is bad. Please find a new provider for your son.", "Not just mental health. I work physical therapy and insurance doesn\u2019t pay out shit either. Insurance is basically a game of who doesn\u2019t pay and who we can pass off responsibility to.", "This is why everyone is private pay which is too expensive for most people", "And sometimes insurance retroactively changes their mind and claws back money! Or otherwise takes months to pay for a session, sometimes deciding not to pay for it at all. The stuff US therapists go through is insane.\n\nHere in Canada my session fee is set. You pay it, i give you a receipt, you submit it to insurance and they'll reimburse you. If your insurance doesn't pay jack shit, that's your problem", "It\u2019s so hard to find therapists who even take insurance, and this is why. They usually do it until their practice is full and then either take a limited number of insurance clients or just stop taking new insurance clients and transition their practice to cash/credit cards only. As long as they take insurance, they can\u2019t set their own rates; they have to do a lot more paperwork (and it\u2019s different with each insurance company); usually bookkeeping and accounting takes longer/ costs more; and claims sometimes get rejected after the service. \n\nI\u2019ve got a few friends who are therapists and they typically want to take insurance to be more accessible, but a lot of them eventually decide to just go cash/credit card only, and instead offer a limited number of pro bono or sliding scale cases so they can help people who otherwise couldn\u2019t afford them.", "That\u2019s why I quit being a therapist. The pay is horrible and just not worth it.", "Provider swho are in network with a health plan in the U.S. typically have a contract with the health plan. If their reimbursement isn't appropriate, it may be possible for the provider to do some negotiation when it's time to renew the contract. Even Medicare has to adjust reimbursement periodically.", "That must be frustrating for them if that's true, but it's obviously not OP's problem.", "While this is true, the therapist made the choice to participate in that patient\u2019s plan with their negotiated reimbursement rates. It is a travesty how poorly mental and behavioral health practitioners can be paid, and this is precisely why so many refuse to accept any insurance and work for cash only. However, that is not the duty of the patient to correct, and it was wildly unethical of the therapist to make that request.", "I'm Canadian, so the medical treatment is different. If you go with provincial therapists )ones employed by the government), it's free, but the wait list is forever, if you have private insurance, they pay, usually 70-90% depending on the insurance company and coverage you're paying for up to a maximum amount per year.", "They will pry my Oxford comma from my cold, dead hands.", "\u201cHealed\u201d can mean different things to different people. It can mean no longer waking up to nightmares on a nightly basis  because you\u2019ve processed your trauma, or being able to finally order that cup of coffee because you\u2019re no longer anxiously avoiding the social experience. Describing something as \u201clife changing\u201d sets the bar quite high for therapy, or anything for that matter.", "Co-pay definition :\n\n\"contribution made by an insured person toward the cost of medical treatment or other services.\"\n\nMedical proffesionals can set their prices even if they have a fee guide set by their proffesional oversight body. Insurances choose to cap the amounts they pay for a fee (or pay a % of their capped fee) for a specific treatment. Often insurance doesnt keep up with what a treatments should cost. This results in a co-pay.", "Considering all of the post, not just the unethical bad behavior, I made a judgement call, that\u2019s the point of the sub", "He sounds amazing. I wish I could find a doctor like that. If I discussed chapped lips with my doctor she'd add \"cheilitis consultation\" to my bill and tack on another $199.", "It's 100% an ethical violation. By policy I can't accept cookies from a family(this is partially so we have an excuse as some of our families are... Less than cleanly). But nothing of \"value\". Actual cash... I'd be out on my ass.", "I\u2019m a psychologist and did therapy for 40 years. This therapist is incredibly unethical and should be reported to insurance and all governing bodies.", "Another social worker (likely in a different state) just wanting to add that MH therapists/ licensed social workers/ psychologists etc have a very structured and clear code of ethics. And this is definitely a no no. I would contact the licensing board to file a complaint. I literally cannot believe what I hear others in my profession do sometimes", "And I just want to stress to OP that this is a *serious* ethical breach. \nIt\u2019s not a grey area.", "Those national associations are not licensing bodies. What OP needs is the licensing entity for his state.", "NASP is for school psychologists. You'd want APA, but even that's not a licensing body - it depends on the state in the U.S.", "Yep. If parents want to give us something, I recommend things for the whole unit, like a box of Timbits or a card. I'm in paediatrics, so we get a lot of hand-drawn cards and pictures we'll put up as well", "The families of a couple long-term patients tried to give me wedding presents. Nope, sorry, straight to the admin office with it :(", "[removed]", "Might as well see how bad it\u2019ll burn, tell a tip for tip", "Wasting money, yes, but also likely making whatever situation precipitated the therapy actively worse, not better.", "And for PT one needs a prescription from an MD, then that has to be approved by insurance and they limit the number of sessions.", "I love how PTs are now supposed to get doctorates, but will the insurance pay for the increased costs of a PT with a doctorate? Nope.\n\nGotta love the american healthcare system! \"Profits Uber Alles!\"", "My kid's therapist is $110 for an hour session, that's after insurance (our copay). For us, worth every penny, but I'd be lying if I said it was easy to afford.", "Fr I remember being in residential mental health places and so many girls would go home because their insurance would drop them in the middle of treatment because they decided they were okay or something. It even happened to my brother who really needed to be there at the time and we have good insurance.", "You are naive if you think this is a negotiation that actually happens. \n\nA hospital network can negotiate. An individual provider takes what that insurer offers or goes out of network which means many patients leave because the insurer pays $0 OON. \n\nMedicare is its own thing. Few mental health providers take it because it pays so poorly\u2026 even though Medicare patients often have great need for mental health services.", "That's true across the board. If you're in the US, have you ever looked at one of your Explanation of Benefits forms? It tella you what the provider charged and what the insurance company paid.", "I'm laughing, but also crying on the inside.", "Yep,  I've been in places where you can't accept a birthday card, let alone anything you could use to purchase goods and services. \n\n\n\nPlus this is *hella* illegal from an insurance perspective.  Like, if I understand correctly this is fraud & double dipping. \n\n\n\nIf she can suggest this so casually I doubt it's the only thing happening.", "Can I ask you a question? Please feel free not to answer. \nI grew a small houseplant and want to gift it to my therapist. Would she be able to except it? \nIts value is small like $2 in materials", "She needs to renegotiate her contract with your insurance company, then. That's not your burden to carry,NAT", "The NASW is the licensing body for social workers. Not sure about the others, but the NASW is definitely the group that handles disciplinary actions for licensed social workers.", "I had one patient write multiple people poems. That was cute.", "If she\u2019s in network with the insurance, it\u2019s a set reimbursement for the particular service rendered. It sucks and it probably is too low but that\u2019s not the client\u2019s fault. The therapist shouldn\u2019t be in network with an insurance company that reimburses lower than she\u2019s willing to accept. \n\nP.S. Definitely not allowed to accept anything over what insurance reimburses. That\u2019s in the in network contract.", "Yes that too, and that's probably more important than the money.", "That depends on the state. In some of them (MD and DC for example), you can self-refer for PT.", "Medicare pays better than United Healthcare, at least that's been my expierence in the years I've spent working in a doctor's office. We also have more issues with them than \n\nI can't speak to mental health though.", "Crying in red white and blue.", "It would depend on her comfort level and the writing of her policies. Where I work it says that small items (cookies, cards, ect) are ok. I generally refuse anything other than written notes due to my comfort level.", "They most definitely are not. NASW is a voluntary professional organization. They publish a code of ethics that many states have adopted in their rules. But the licensing bodies are all government entities.", "This is absolutely untrue. The NASW doesn't license anyone or anything. They're a trade group.", "Health care licensure is at the state level in the US, so how can a national body license social workers?", "Murica! Fuck yeah!"]}
