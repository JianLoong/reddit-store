Its fine to think your time is worth more, but there are channels for this sort of thing. \n\nOne slight issue might be unilaterally cancelling the therapist your family has worked with.

Did not disclose that they had GH to any of the patients prior to transmission either. The doc just crossed their fingers and started slinging scripts to the ones that developed outbreaks. Of course a psychiatrist prescribing Valtrex to patients set off red flags and two of the patients made complaints to the licensing board. Huge investigation started and it was discovered that the doc was also prescribing sought after narcotics and benzos to other patients in return for sex. It was nuts!! So many ethical lines crossed in that one. Still don\u2019t understand how they were able to get their license back ever after that. I believe they eventually lost it permanently. Just one of the many crazy stories from my days in malpractice insurance. It definitely wasn\u2019t a boring job. We decided not to help the doc find coverage, because we didn\u2019t want to do business with someone like that.

What she is doing may be illegal.", "Uh.. by doing what the therapist did to OP...", "The only way to be able to negotiate with the insurers is to be a part of a large organization. When you have a healthy percentage of the population in your area going to one group the insurance company doesn\u2019t want to lose you. They\u2019re still rat bastards but at least you get some leverage. \n\nSource: was a data analyst for a large medical company for a number of years.", "I am a massage therapist. I don't take private insurance because they don't pay what I charge for a treatment.  (Those that do usually have multiple massage therapists on staff and a full time insurance biller and play the bulk numbers game with client loads).  But I know the rates ahead of time, as, I assume, she did, so she could have created a better policy about that.  The provider might be able to charge a copay if the insurance reimbursement isn't adequate, but sometimes insurance companies disallow this.  The whole thing sucks for providers.", "Thank you for standing up for the therapist. I have tricare and it\u2019s impossible to find a therapist who accepts tricare, because they barely pay $50 an hour, which is before the taxes that the therapist would need to pay on that, and any operational expenses. Everyone in my area charges well over a $100.", "I worked for the damn DMV and couldn't accept the most adorable dollar tree earmuffs from some 90 year old lady getting her ID card renewed.", "OP is likely not the only person she\u2019s hit up with this idea.  And how do you misunderstand being asked to give a tip?\n\nGlad OP fired her.  They could try reporting her but it could end up as he said/she said.", "I'm in a medical billing cert course right now. You are 100% correct. It's fraud.", "I always stopped and got ice cream or other treats for my therapist. Gave her gifts. I was with her for around 7 years though too.", "As sweet as you make him sound (thoughtful, kind), it makes me automatically think he was a total gentleman about it. I'm sure he felt terrible! Sweet guy! \ud83d\udda4\ud83e\udd79"]}
