I just started staying at his apartment recently for overnights. He\u2019s my first real boyfriend.\n\nI live at home with my family still and we\u2019re very open. I walk around in a shirt and my underwear majority of the time, and it\u2019s not an all girls house hold. I have a dad, and two brothers ages 17 and 14. I also did it growing up and I also have an older brother. If guest stopped by un announced growing up so be it, they\u2019d see us in our bedwear. It\u2019s just the normal for me, and I guess I expected other people to do it.\n\nAs you could probably imagine, I did this at my boyfriends apartment when it was just the two of us, which he loved. Then two days ago his brother stopped by and I came out of the shower in a t shirt and cheakies underwear(but not too cheakies it only exposed a little.) When my bf saw me he immediately whispered to me to put on some pants which I did. After his brother left he was super pissed an asked if I was trying to \u201cseduce his brother or something.\u201d I told him I didn\u2019t mean anything by it, just that at home I walk around like this, and he said well not at his home and not when we have guest. He told me I looked like I was trying to \u201cstrut it for his brother.\u201d I apologized but he was super upset and went to sleep early, which isn\u2019t like our normal sleepovers since I stay over so rarely. \n\nIt\u2019s been 3 days and he hasn\u2019t asked me to sleepover again.

And no, it\u2019s not normal to prance around in your underwear in front of guests.", "If you don\u2019t know the difference between wearing just a t-shirt and underwear around your family vs in front of your bf\u2019s (of 3 freaking months no less) brother, you are way too immature to be having sleepovers at anyone\u2019s house.\nYTA", "YTA\n\nPeople you are unfamiliar with don't need to see your underwear.", "YTA.  \n\nI grew up in a relaxed home too.  Yet I knew--and you know too--that \"underwear\" are called \"underwear\" because it's normal for them to be worn under clothing.  Walking around in underwear around people who aren't family members and who have the same gender as people you date is a sexual statement and you know it.\n\nYou don't have to have the same attitudes as your boyfriend does about clothing, but you should respect his feelings by getting dressed when people who aren't him or your family or your friends are around.  Also, his brother may have felt uncomfortable.", "YTA Respect his boundaries, or leave.  Don't pretend the rest of the world grew up like you did.\nWe were a casual underwear family, too, but we put on clothes when others come over.  You know it's a problem.

Like there is literally no country in the world where it would be okay for someone to be only wearing their underwear (what they consider to be under garments) in front of strangers - especially someone of the opposite sex and when you're not even in your house.   \n\n\nLike you've never had a job, changed in a gym, stayed at friend's house, never seen a movie/show where someone walks into someone changing and at 20 years old this is the first time you realized that other people might be uncomfortable seeing you in your panties?  \n\n\nThat's seriously something you think is believable?", "Info: Do you know his brother or his history? Would you be cool if he was in his undies?", "Asshole? No. You two simply have a different understanding and comfort level regarding undergarments at home. Basically, you're naive, and being young having grown up in whatever way you did, that's just what you're used to. It's not the most common mentality, at least not in the US, but it's what you grew up knowing apparently. \n\nYour boyfriend is going to feel the way he feels about it, and you can't help that. All you can really do is just assure him that it was naivety and how you grew up, not a seductive or malicious predatory move, and move forward, of course with the understanding that with your boyfriend, company over means covering up. This isn't to downplay what you're comfortable with, but if company is coming over to his house, they are also more likely to share his sentiments with comfort-levels regarding clothing as well, so it's more of a benefit to all parties involved. If it is a dealbreaker, though, you're young and it's early in the relationship, you can go your own way if you need to. Somehow, though, I don't imagine a little misunderstanding like this would be cause for a dealbreaker on your end.", "It's a little unusual, but you're definitely NTA.

You are now at your sexual partner\u2019s home and in this environment you are subject to some degree of sexual gaze. As someone whose family of origin was very body casual, I\u2019m going to say you need offer an apology for the social misunderstanding and present yourself yourself fully clothed in common areas in the future.", "I know this is against a lot of the top comments, but I'm leaning toward NAH. OP is used to this, it's her norm. Her bf isn't. He confronted her about it, she put on pants and then explained and apologised. I feel like she genuinely meant no harm.\n\nIt's just a communication thing, now that she knows she'll wear her pants at his place (I'm hoping). BF is not an AH because for him, and obviously most people, its a bit weird but I don't think he's handled the aftermath very maturely, seems like she made an honest mistake, which again, she apologised for!", "Unless you argued about having to put on pants, I would say your BF is overreacting. I don\u2019t see you as the asshole in this situation, you have a different mindset then most, but nothing so spectacular that you need to be locked up. \n\nHonsetly that reaction from your BF seems like a bigger red flag to me, then the fact that you have a different upbringing to him. Shows he\u2019s insecure and seems to not trust you. I agree that we put on pants when we have company, but I would never assume my GF was trying to seduce someone over this. Seems far fetched imo.", "I don't understand why you wbta. You came out of the shower and he was just suddenly there.  \nI also don't agree with the whole notion that your body is somehow his to decide who can see it.\n\nAre you allowed to wear a bathing suit at the beach? How about skinny jeans or short shorts?", "YTA - don\u2019t walk around in your underwear when there is a guest there.  And it doesn\u2019t matter whether the guest is male or female.  Now you know etiquette.   Start practicing it.", "NTA.\n\nI guess most of the redditors here come from family cultures that overly sexualise any form of nudity. There seems to be a belief that women\u2019s clothing choices exists not in any way for the comfort of women, but for the male sexual gaze. \n\nI think if your bf had said \u2018Oh nudity is more unusual in my family\u2019 and \u2018would it be okay with you to wear pants when we have guests\u2019, I\u2019d be more sympathic.\n\nBut to run with \u2018your clothing choices mean you\u2019re trying to seduce my brother\u2019 is serious AH behaviour from him. I would be very upset with him if I were you. \n\nMe and my boyfriend are mostly in underwear in the house. If guests come round unannounced, they adapt. My partner is also Brazilian and it\u2019s very normal because is hot in Brazil, so the less clothing the more comfortable.\n\nI\u2019m so confused at all of these Y T A comments. Very weird, conservative, patriarchal views.", "YTA not your home,  not your place to walk about with barely anything on. Congratulations, you may have just possibly ruined your relationship.", "NAH.

Goddamn but Americans have the most ridiculous hang ups about nudity", "YTA", "He overreacted on this but your boyfriend has his own reasons, just dress properly in front of guests from now on and I am sure this can be fixed. In the end I would say YTA, but if your relationship is trustful than there is no reason to think you were doing that on purpose.", "NAH-  I don\u2019t think you did it in bad faith.

If that is the hill you want to die on and you wanted to pull some \"controlling\", not letting you be free to be you crap then fine, have a nice life. There is the door.

I don\u2019t believe that you genuinely lack the self awareness to know what you did was inappropriate.

I'm sorry but even in your family that is just weird, in my opinion that should be only for your significant other to see. If you heard a random person walk in the house of your boyfriend I would think you would put pants on because not every family does that and not only that, did you meet the boyfriend's family before? Have you ever been to his families house? You wouldn't go out in public in underwear so that really should apply at a new person's house if a guest is there, common sense.", "YTA. Wearing just underwear around your immediate family or SO is one thing. I often just wear a shirt and underwear at home because it's comfy and I know my family members are okay/used to that way of dress. However, wearing just underwear in front of any guest who is not so close that you know it's okay, is weird and uncomfortable. \nIt is quite naive to think that lack of modesty and wearing just underwear is appropriate around anyone and everyone. Like, would you have done the same thing if his dad dropped by? I would be super uncomfortable if I went to my friends house and her husband or father took his pants off and started walking around and talking to me in his tighty whiteys. It wouldn't seem decent and I probably would not go back to be honest. In future I would communicate to make sure it's okay before greeting guests in someone elses home without your pants on.

You should have had better awareness that your BF might not have the same clothing standards as you.

Although it is something unusual to be with guests in underwear, i have to admit. But you were not trying to seduce his brother nor did you argue about putting on pants. You even apologized for it. (I lived with siblings and i saw my sister in underwear but never in the common area where there could be guests.)\n\nNo, it's not common to be with your guests while you are in underwear but that's how you are used to live. Now that you live with others you should adapt certain ways of life, of course, just like everybody in a relationship. But that's completely normal.

Now I won't do it around anyone but my wife, because my siblings fell out of my comfort circle. \n\nA fair compromise in my opinion, is to just put pants on when there's a guest.

You should sit your BF down and tell him that you meant nothing by it, and want to reach a compromise.", "NAH everyone who said YTA probably live in an over conservative household and find nudity weird. Europeans would be really confused about this being a problem.

Also didn't find it weird when I had a boyfriend who's roommate walked around in her underwear (they were french), or sometimes completely topless. She would walk around naked and sometimes get the mail, pizza, etc. And forget to put clothes on in front of delivery people and even in front of my ex's parents.

You put your bf in the position to be the bad guy who has to parent you and the brother probably just felt completely awkward or worse he liked it which would be bad for you and your relationship and further make your bf feel weird.

Also what kind of message are you sending the brother?
