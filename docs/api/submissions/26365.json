I just started staying at his apartment recently for overnights. He\u2019s my first real boyfriend.\n\nI live at home with my family still and we\u2019re very open. I walk around in a shirt and my underwear majority of the time, and it\u2019s not an all girls house hold. I have a dad, and two brothers ages 17 and 14. I also did it growing up and I also have an older brother. If guest stopped by un announced growing up so be it, they\u2019d see us in our bedwear. It\u2019s just the normal for me, and I guess I expected other people to do it.\n\nAs you could probably imagine, I did this at my boyfriends apartment when it was just the two of us, which he loved. Then two days ago his brother stopped by and I came out of the shower in a t shirt and cheakies underwear(but not too cheakies it only exposed a little.) When my bf saw me he immediately whispered to me to put on some pants which I did. After his brother left he was super pissed an asked if I was trying to \u201cseduce his brother or something.\u201d I told him I didn\u2019t mean anything by it, just that at home I walk around like this, and he said well not at his home and not when we have guest. He told me I looked like I was trying to \u201cstrut it for his brother.\u201d I apologized but he was super upset and went to sleep early, which isn\u2019t like our normal sleepovers since I stay over so rarely. \n\nIt\u2019s been 3 days and he hasn\u2019t asked me to sleepover again.

While you might be comfortable with this at home, you have to have a bit of common sense to understand that you are *not* at your own home and you were aware his brother was there (per your reply to someone else).", "YTA \n\nYou heard his brother was there and you still got cheeky (no pun intended). And no, it\u2019s not normal to prance around in your underwear in front of guests.", "If you don\u2019t know the difference between wearing just a t-shirt and underwear around your family vs in front of your bf\u2019s (of 3 freaking months no less) brother, you are way too immature to be having sleepovers at anyone\u2019s house.\nYTA", "YTA\n\nPeople you are unfamiliar with don't need to see your underwear.", "YTA.  \n\nI grew up in a relaxed home too.  Yet I knew--and you know too--that \"underwear\" are called \"underwear\" because it's normal for them to be worn under clothing.  Walking around in underwear around people who aren't family members and who have the same gender as people you date is a sexual statement and you know it.\n\nYou don't have to have the same attitudes as your boyfriend does about clothing, but you should respect his feelings by getting dressed when people who aren't him or your family or your friends are around.  Also, his brother may have felt uncomfortable.", "YTA Respect his boundaries, or leave.  Don't pretend the rest of the world grew up like you did.\nWe were a casual underwear family, too, but we put on clothes when others come over.  You know it's a problem. Go apologize, or move on.", "Soft YTA. \n\nAsking you to not strut around his house half naked when guests are over is a pretty reasonable request. \n\nWould you be okay with him socialising with your family and friends in his tighty-whities?", "Unless this was an accident, YTA. Put on some clothes around his family. That would be just as inappropriate for him to do around your family as it is for you to do around his family.", "YTA. None of your family is going to look at you in a sexual manner. Your bf brother probably will, even if he never acts on it.

You guys have different visions on this and need to work it out. I do think it was a little inappropriate to do so, but I also get it if it were an accident. It's not like you did it on purpose and had any ideas of it...", "YTA  \n\n\nSorry but making other people feel uncomfortable and being so inconsiderate and insensitive.   \n\n\nI'm not sure I buy that you're a grown woman and you don't know it's inappropriate to walk around in your underwear in front of other people/strangers.   \n\n\nDoesn't matter the gender honestly.   \n\n\nThat's inapporpriate in any culture. Like there is literally no country in the world where it would be okay for someone to be only wearing their underwear (what they consider to be under garments) in front of strangers - especially someone of the opposite sex and when you're not even in your house.   \n\n\nLike you've never had a job, changed in a gym, stayed at friend's house, never seen a movie/show where someone walks into someone changing and at 20 years old this is the first time you realized that other people might be uncomfortable seeing you in your panties?  \n\n\nThat's seriously something you think is believable?", "Info: Do you know his brother or his history? Would you be cool if he was in his undies?", "Asshole? No. You two simply have a different understanding and comfort level regarding undergarments at home. Basically, you're naive, and being young having grown up in whatever way you did, that's just what you're used to. It's not the most common mentality, at least not in the US, but it's what you grew up knowing apparently. \n\nYour boyfriend is going to feel the way he feels about it, and you can't help that. All you can really do is just assure him that it was naivety and how you grew up, not a seductive or malicious predatory move, and move forward, of course with the understanding that with your boyfriend, company over means covering up. This isn't to downplay what you're comfortable with, but if company is coming over to his house, they are also more likely to share his sentiments with comfort-levels regarding clothing as well, so it's more of a benefit to all parties involved. If it is a dealbreaker, though, you're young and it's early in the relationship, you can go your own way if you need to. Somehow, though, I don't imagine a little misunderstanding like this would be cause for a dealbreaker on your end.", "It's a little unusual, but you're definitely NTA. Your boyfriend, on the other hand, sounds very controlling, enough that I'd call it a red flag, and urge you to evaluate the relationship. You're not his property.", "To be fair if she got out of the shower and didnt know the brother was there we don't really have much of an issue, and the bf apparently loves it any other time, however if you knew he was around then I guess that's a whole other thing", "I\u2019m going to give you the benefit of the doubt and say NAH.\n\nYou \u201cgrew up\u201d where underwear was fine because (we assume/hope) no one was sexualizing minors or family members. You are now at your sexual partner\u2019s home and in this environment you are subject to some degree of sexual gaze. As someone whose family of origin was very body casual, I\u2019m going to say you need offer an apology for the social misunderstanding and present yourself yourself fully clothed in common areas in the future.", "I know this is against a lot of the top comments, but I'm leaning toward NAH. OP is used to this, it's her norm. Her bf isn't. He confronted her about it, she put on pants and then explained and apologised. I feel like she genuinely meant no harm.\n\nIt's just a communication thing, now that she knows she'll wear her pants at his place (I'm hoping). BF is not an AH because for him, and obviously most people, its a bit weird but I don't think he's handled the aftermath very maturely, seems like she made an honest mistake, which again, she apologised for!", "Unless you argued about having to put on pants, I would say your BF is overreacting. I don\u2019t see you as the asshole in this situation, you have a different mindset then most, but nothing so spectacular that you need to be locked up. \n\nHonsetly that reaction from your BF seems like a bigger red flag to me, then the fact that you have a different upbringing to him. Shows he\u2019s insecure and seems to not trust you. I agree that we put on pants when we have company, but I would never assume my GF was trying to seduce someone over this. Seems far fetched imo.", "I don't understand why you wbta. You came out of the shower and he was just suddenly there.  \nI also don't agree with the whole notion that your body is somehow his to decide who can see it.\n\nAre you allowed to wear a bathing suit at the beach? How about skinny jeans or short shorts?", "YTA - don\u2019t walk around in your underwear when there is a guest there.  And it doesn\u2019t matter whether the guest is male or female.  Now you know etiquette.   Start practicing it.", "NTA.\n\nI guess most of the redditors here come from family cultures that overly sexualise any form of nudity. There seems to be a belief that women\u2019s clothing choices exists not in any way for the comfort of women, but for the male sexual gaze. \n\nI think if your bf had said \u2018Oh nudity is more unusual in my family\u2019 and \u2018would it be okay with you to wear pants when we have guests\u2019, I\u2019d be more sympathic.\n\nBut to run with \u2018your clothing choices mean you\u2019re trying to seduce my brother\u2019 is serious AH behaviour from him. I would be very upset with him if I were you. \n\nMe and my boyfriend are mostly in underwear in the house. If guests come round unannounced, they adapt. My partner is also Brazilian and it\u2019s very normal because is hot in Brazil, so the less clothing the more comfortable.\n\nI\u2019m so confused at all of these Y T A comments. Very weird, conservative, patriarchal views.", "[deleted]", "NAH. As someone from European country this would be totally normal here?

Goddamn but Americans have the most ridiculous hang ups about nudity", "YTA", "He overreacted on this but your boyfriend has his own reasons, just dress properly in front of guests from now on and I am sure this can be fixed. In the end I would say YTA, but if your relationship is trustful than there is no reason to think you were doing that on purpose.", "NAH-  I don\u2019t think you did it in bad faith.

You're not living with your family, this is the real world and no one wants to see any part of their brothers gfs buttcheeks. Awkward", "YTA. \n\nYou are at least NAIVE. I'd definitely put my foot down too. My girl is not going to walk around half naked in front of other men regardless of how \"normal\" she thinks it is. \n\nWe'd settle that day one. If that is the hill you want to die on and you wanted to pull some \"controlling\", not letting you be free to be you crap then fine, have a nice life. There is the door.

I don\u2019t believe that you genuinely lack the self awareness to know what you did was inappropriate. The specification of \u201ccheeky\u201d underwear reveals that you absolutely recognize the sexual aspect of your behavior and did it on purpose. You even bragged about your boyfriend finding it sexy. You know it\u2019s not \u201cnormal\u201d to walk around in front of random strangers, in someone else\u2019s house no less, half naked.

I'm sorry but even in your family that is just weird, in my opinion that should be only for your significant other to see. If you heard a random person walk in the house of your boyfriend I would think you would put pants on because not every family does that and not only that, did you meet the boyfriend's family before? Have you ever been to his families house? You wouldn't go out in public in underwear so that really should apply at a new person's house if a guest is there, common sense.", "YTA. Wearing just underwear around your immediate family or SO is one thing. I often just wear a shirt and underwear at home because it's comfy and I know my family members are okay/used to that way of dress. However, wearing just underwear in front of any guest who is not so close that you know it's okay, is weird and uncomfortable. \nIt is quite naive to think that lack of modesty and wearing just underwear is appropriate around anyone and everyone. Like, would you have done the same thing if his dad dropped by? I would be super uncomfortable if I went to my friends house and her husband or father took his pants off and started walking around and talking to me in his tighty whiteys. It wouldn't seem decent and I probably would not go back to be honest. In future I would communicate to make sure it's okay before greeting guests in someone elses home without your pants on. Maybe keep a comfy pair of pajama pants nearby to pop on when company comes over.", "He's only been together three months and he's telling you what to do on something you grew up doing some people are just insecure.

You should have had better awareness that your BF might not have the same clothing standards as you.

Although it is something unusual to be with guests in underwear, i have to admit. But you were not trying to seduce his brother nor did you argue about putting on pants. You even apologized for it. (I lived with siblings and i saw my sister in underwear but never in the common area where there could be guests.)\n\nNo, it's not common to be with your guests while you are in underwear but that's how you are used to live. Now that you live with others you should adapt certain ways of life, of course, just like everybody in a relationship. But that's completely normal.

You should sit your BF down and tell him that you meant nothing by it, and want to reach a compromise.", "NAH everyone who said YTA probably live in an over conservative household and find nudity weird. Europeans would be really confused about this being a problem.

Also didn't find it weird when I had a boyfriend who's roommate walked around in her underwear (they were french), or sometimes completely topless. She would walk around naked and sometimes get the mail, pizza, etc. And forget to put clothes on in front of delivery people and even in front of my ex's parents.

Also what kind of message are you sending the brother?

My bf and I live together, so it's normal for me to not wear pants at home, but if anyone came over I'd immediately change into more modest attire. When my bf and I first started dating, he had some roommates (a couple, girl and guy) and the girl would constantly walk around in her underwear or her bra or really revealing clothing.

I want to add that I do think he is valid in having those feelings and wanting her to have some sort of clothes on when guests (especially his family) are over.", "This happened to me in SeaWorld at China.\n\nThe male changing rooms... everyone was naked. And at first, being American, I was super self conscious but my dad said it was ok and pointed out thar no one gave af about being seen.\n\nSo when my brother and i disrobed. And my dad too, lo and behold, no one cared....", "Just so you know, it's tighty whities, not tidy.", "I absolutely think no boys should hang out with their families wearing boxers.", "Ahahahaha - that's awesome. To this day, I have never heard that expression.\nI'm forever using that at any occasion now.", "no, I think she just had never seen a boy in his undies before", "The thing about guys wearing only boxers is that when the guy sits down, his testicles are dangling cutely in view \ud83d\ude01", "This!!!   Everyone can set their own boundaries in there own home.   It\u2019s not a thing until it\u2019s made into a thing!!  The boyfriend could just easily say that he would prefer when guests come over to please dress more modestly for his comfort.", "Wear a robe, not a short one.", "A giant T shirt can go down far enough to hide shorts under it, let alone underwear. Wearing a really big one can be like wearing a dress and is probably fine. But if the T-shirt isn\u2019t covering OP\u2019s panties then yeah that\u2019s weird, don\u2019t walk around that way around people you aren\u2019t sleeping with. It might be ok w the brother she grew up with but definitely not her boyfriend\u2019s brother!\n\nThat being said it\u2019s not something to break up over. She shouldn\u2019t do it again and he should get over it.", "... But but but step brother... I'm stuck in the dryer!?", "Not everyone sexualizes exposed skin all the time either.  Nobody should be any less comfortable in a house with someone in underwear than they are going swimming with them.  It's all about social norms and social conditioning. \n\nOp isn't the AH.  At worst OP was unaware of their social norms but was instantly willing to alter for someone else's comfort/preference.  The bf being all pissy afterwards, making thise accusations and holding a grudge about it for days is definitely the AH.  He's being emotionally childish.", "Thongs+", "Idk, I think an appropriate reaction would have been to ask her to cover up, feel his mad feelings, and express to his partner that that isn\u2019t appropriate behaviour in his household and that it makes people uncomfortable or can be taken the wrong way.\n\nAssuming intent on a one-time situation and accusing her of something pretty shitty and questioning her character is an overreaction. Now, if there was a history of her being inappropriate with bro, it\u2019s a reasonable accusation. But given the context of this being normal for her family, it happening only once, and her immediately putting on pants when asked, I think it\u2019s reasonable to expect that your partner will give you the benefit of the doubt and not immediately jump to sexist \u201ctemptress\u201d accusations followed by a silent treatment.", "I knew that. On account of my normal omniscience.", "Maybe yours arent tidy but mine are! Wash your undies gents!", "My boxers have an open fly and the inseam is probably 3 or 4 inches.  If I sat down, my family would see Dad's junk.  Nobody wants to see Dad's junk.", "Never watched Friends I take it? :)", "Yeah. In my situation with my gfs roommate, this was also in SW Arizona. People wore minimal clothes as a rule. Id seen her roommate in a bikini almost every day due to laying out.", "I would definitely be uncomfortable with anyone just walking around in their underwear if I was visiting them at their house. It just feels awkward.", "Do you not allow your siblings to go to public pools or beaches?", "I am going to date myself, but once upon a time, there were sleep shirts - overly long tees that went half to your knees and were as long or longer than most jersey dresses. I still see them on occasion. \n\nBut, otherwise I agree that OP should get some sleep shorts or sweats or other loungewear to avoid flashing visitors or roommates.", "*sleep shorts that cover your cheeks", "So normal!", "There are people who just think it's cool to show their entire butt to strangers. I once saw someone walking down the street in a short dress and I could see her entire butt hanging out. So awkward.", "I\u2019ve been dating myself my whole life, and the romance is just gone."]}
