{"id": 16355, "submission_id": "137cvd9", "title": "AITA for informing someone\u2019s parents of their online recklessness and bullying?", "selftext": "I(F14) recently emailed the father of someone who has been harassing me online. \n\nIn said email, I informed their father that they need to be taught internet safety. Just from the username and bio of their public TikTok account I was able to find all sorts of personal information about this person. They\u2019re only 14 years old so this could become a bigger problem if even a child like myself is able to find extremely personal information based on just a couple pieces of information. \n\nI also informed her father about the harassment I experienced over the past couple months. They went over every video on my profile and made awful comments. They tagged their friends who in turn harassed me more. They called me slurs for my sexuality and gender identity. They told me a total of 7 different times that I should commit suicide. You may be asking what I did to deserve this treatment. The only thing I did to them was respond to one of their many comments with an insult that was way less intense than theirs was.\n\nSince I was able to find who their parents were, I went ahead and emailed them about the matter. I informed them of everything listed above and other things that may get this post removed. About an hour later I opened my phone to see a DM from the person who has been harassing me.\n\nThey wrote so much that it was practically an essay about how I\u2019ve entirely ruined their social life and how they won\u2019t be able to attend any of their extracurricular activities or have access to social media for months because of what I told their parents. \n\nI\u2019m starting to feel like an asshole because of this DM. Maybe it would\u2019ve been better off if I didn\u2019t send the email?", "created_utc": 1683184021, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/137cvd9/aita_for_informing_someones_parents_of_their/", "score": 166, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I\u2019ve supposedly ruined their entire life outside of school and gotten their social media taken away and they were even removed from their swim team.
