And now that you do, it would be totally fair to let him know that you'd like that chunk of change to go towards the thing you want more. \n\nAlso, if you've flagged the gaming laptop a bunch of times and he's leaning towards the PS5 instead, well.... ok maybe he genuinely thinks you'd prefer the PS5, or *maybe* he's getting a gift that's actually more for both of you than really *for you*?\n\nI'm not gonna accuse him, cos I don't know, but it's a thought that springs to mind.", "Not an AH thing imo but I would just happily accept whatever gift a person wishes to give then buy things I wanted on my own.", "Start saving money for your own laptop or ask for a donation to buy you the laptop. Proper gaming laptops can be really pricey!!! more pricey than a Ps5.  \n\n\nMaybe he is just more on budget on giving gifts than you are?", "NTA.\n\nHonestly, with the rarity of these consoles (are they still rare?) I can understand his reasoning, bc if it's a reasonable price... He can upgrade gaming for you guys. \n\nAlternatively. If you have been clear about preferring a gaming PC/laptop (I only give the distinction bc of the cost, blah blah fucking blah. None of it really matters if this is exactly what she wants), then I understand the frustration. \n\nYou tell someone who has asked for your desired present. You tell them.

And make clear it's not a PS5.\n\nIf he wants a PS5 and has the budget for it, cool.  But it's good manners to get someone what they want for their birthday, particularly when they've already told you directly.\n\nIf he doesn't have the funds now, it's better to wait to get what you really want, rather than get something you really don't want on your birthday", "Gaming laptops are super expensive relative to a ps5. For this reason it may seem unfair to ask for a different gift. Maybe you can save up for the laptop and accept a gift that you know you both will use and enjoy. YTA, imho, I\u2019m sorry.", "I thought the same thing. \n\nHe wants to get you a PS5 so that he can also play on it. \n\nI\u2019d let him know directly that you want a gaming laptop for YOUR birthday. \n\nYou can buy the PS 5 together as a joint holiday gift to each other.", "Good grief, that would be next level AH if someone did that. I hope this isn\u2019t real advice!", "It is an AH to give your partner a gift that YOU yourself want and they don't.", "I agree with that statement in general. But regarding this particular post and couple, they talked about how a ps5 would be one of their next dream consoles. It\u2019s something they both want. It\u2019s overall a great gift for a gamer. And something they can enjoy together, on top of everything. The laptop is cool, but those are like 3X the price, if not more!"]}
