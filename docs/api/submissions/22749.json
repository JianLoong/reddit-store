{"id": 22749, "submission_id": "154uuky", "title": "AITA for telling my girlfriend about my cancelled proposal plan?", "selftext": "My girlfriend (F27) and I (M27) have been dating for five years now, and things have been perfect. The number one thing I love about her is her selflessness towards her loved ones. She is also not someone who is demanding for the \u201cfiner things\u201d due to her selflessness, but I always try to spoil her regardless. \n\nMy girlfriend is not a vain person, but she has an insecurity around her tendency to develop some small pimples on her cheeks and chin during her period. It never bothers me, but she hates them.\n\nWell, about nine months ago we planned an international trip together. I wanted to give her an idealistic proposal since she always does so much for everyone else. I had arranged for a candlelit dinner near a famous landmark at the destination. Afterwards, we were going to walk over to a gazebo, and I was going to propose. I had booked the dinner and even hired a photographer.\n\nFast forward to the actual trip, and something we hadn\u2019t accounted for was her period. Unfortunately, two days before my planned proposal it arrived. She said she felt bloated, but otherwise we were still able to enjoy those days of the trip. However, she did develop some pimples.\n\nWhile walking around town the morning of the proposal, she said to me in a teasing way \u201cplease don\u2019t propose while I\u2019m covered in pimples.\u201d I played along and laughed, but I felt my heart racing, so I feigned playfulness and said \u201cOver a few pimples?\u201d And she got a little more serious, saying she wasn\u2019t sure if I planned on doing it during the trip, but that she didn\u2019t want such a romantic moment to have a blemish. I tried to push back without revealing my plan, but I could tell she was sincere and could see her insecurity taking over. I had no idea what to do, but I didn\u2019t want to create resentment in her over what was supposed to be her fairytale moment, so I cancelled all but the dinner. Admittedly, there was a weird vibe the rest of the trip, despite my best efforts.\n\nWhen we got home, we finally addressed the weird vibe. I came clean and told her about my plan. I even made sure to express to her that I wasn\u2019t upset (not entirely true). After I told her, her eyes welled up, and she said she was sorry for ruining my plan. However, she mentioned that I should have never told her about this, because now she\u2019s going to carry this guilt forever (her words) since that was the main purpose for taking an expensive international trip together.\n\nI always thought being open was right, but now I feel awful for creating guilt inside of her. I do also feel upset for the plan being squashed by something that could be photoshopped, but I\u2019m trying to respect her insecurities. Also, the last thing I want to do right now is pile onto her guilt. Was it dumb to come clean?", "created_utc": 1689868552, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/154uuky/aita_for_telling_my_girlfriend_about_my_cancelled/", "score": 160, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I told my girlfriend about my cancelled proposal plan after an expensive international trip.\n\n2. I unintentionally have made her feel guilty, as the reason I cancelled the plan was due to a comment she made about not wanting to have her proposal while covered in pimples.

It was just unfortunate timing about something she's really insecure about.  \n\nI don't know what the \"perfect\" response would have been. But now that it's happened, you can only deal with what's in front of you now.  \n\nI would suggest telling her that there will be other trips in your future together.

What's her plan if she gets her period on your wedding day?", "NTA - honestly dude if you're at the point of cancelling a proposal (at her request and insecurity) over pimples that she gets every month, she really needs to see a doctor to address the pimples (different birth control, skincare route, etc) or see a mental health expert to help her learn to be okay with it.\n\nYou literally followed and did what she asked you to... then she got mad because you did that and shared it, because it's a HUGE thing to have to cancel at the last minute and left both of you in a weird mood. It's completely fair in a marriage to be able to share your feelings if your partner did something to upset you. Even if they don't want to hear it, you need to be able to share it for your own mental health and to not build up resentment.", "NTA.  secrets are worse than the truth.    if you guys have already agreed to marry what is the point of an elaborate proposal.   I would let her pick out a ring and then go to a place of her choosing for social media posts which I assume was the reason for the pimples comment.", "NTA. She sounds exhausting lmao", "Nta\n\n\nShe has deep insecurities. Unfortunately, that means she wasn't comfortable with the dream proposal scenario. Too bad. \n\n\n\nSide note. I think there is a certain level of unrealistic expectations regarding the proposal and circumstances in your post.\n\n\nIt sounds very superficial to me. Personally, when my bf does propose and I am in pjs. I would be over the moon. You could always take another photo. \n\nWhat matters most is the promise, not the photos.", "NAH.\n\nYour girl has major self esteem issues clearly.

That being said, you did exactly as she asked - you didn\u2019t propose while she had pimples. And that was her choice because of her insecurities, and she needs to own that. The \u201cguilt\u201d she now has isn\u2019t your fault. \u201cYou should never have told me\u201d isn\u2019t a reasonable thing for her to ask for because 1.

There's also a lot of pressure on you to make it perfect. \nI think you both need to breathe and shake off the pressure. No one's proposal is perfect, that's honestly part of the fun of proposal stories. Find a way to laugh about it together. It's good practice for the wedding because something goes wrong at every wedding (my purple wedding cake arrived icy blue and my MOH got lipstick on my dress. Stuff happens haha).

This is why I feel weird about big proposals anyway - they place such a huge amount of pressure on a moment being perfect. But you couldn't have done anything else after she explicitly told you not to propose, and her insecurity doesn't mean you have to swallow your own feelings. You must be disappointed that this thing you planned was effectively ruined, right? \n\nMaybe some therapy would help her work through her feelings around her image, and maybe there's a way to move forward in your relationship without the pressure of a perfectly photographed moment.

How bored are you people?", "I really think people need to calm down about their proposals. I can\u2019t imagine telling someone not to propose while on a romantic, international vacation bc of some pimples. I feel bad that you had such a wonderful proposal planned and something dumb ruined it.", "NAH\n\nShe's upset because her body was being a jerk at the exact wrong time and is taking responsibility onto her own shoulders when it's not her fault, hence the misplaced guilt. It sucks, but her feelings are reasonable and make a lot of sense.\n\nI don't think telling her was wrong either, though. I'm a huge fan of openness. If I were you, I'd try to word something like, \"there's no need to feel guilty, love. It's not your fault at all, and I care very much about your comfort and boundaries which is why I thought to wait. Even though it didn't work out this time, it was a dream to get to spend such a magical vacation with you. I told you because I value our openness with each other, and I want to reassure you that the opportunity to have a wonderful proposal moment hasn't passed or expired\".

It was very considerate of you to put her wants over yours in the moment AND it's okay to be feeling a little upset about it. It's also okay that you told her. She probably is feeling bad about putting you through the extra effort and may need a little encouragement that she is worth that and so much more. \n\nAt the end of the day, your proposal is going to be great no matter the time or place, or what is on her face.", "NAH\n\nI see that you're worried about not being able to plan/afford another ideal and romantic trip, and that's a sensitive topic. Maybe you should reframe what's important about a proposal - It's about sharing the things you love with the person you love.\n\nYou could surprise her with a proposal built around an entirely different but fun day. Go get your favorite ice cream or something and propose in a lovely park. And let it show that every experience, grand or simple, is made better with her.", "NAH. idk why everyone thinks the gf willingly ruined OP\u2019s proposal. Op did nothing wrong by not proposing after being told not to. it\u2019s unfortunate, but y\u2019all are acting like she could gaze into the future, see the proposal and actively decide to ruin it because of a few pimples. Even if she had a feeling he was going to propose, she didn\u2019t know for sure! Insecurities exist, and they suck. Hopefully, Op and his girlfriend can learn from this and whatever/whenever the proposal comes it will be even more special.", "NAH. I understand why she feels bad, but imo, the purpose of the international trip was to have a good time and make good memories, which you did! And the proposal would have just been a cherry on top.\n\nYou can still have a wonderful, romantic proposal, no expensive vacation required, *and* you had a lovely trip that sounds like you both enjoyed the hell out of. Now you'll get two wonderful memories instead of just one!\n\nI'm sure in time, she'll stop blaming herself, since you don't seem to be blaming her. For now, focus on the positives, concoct your new (pimple-free) plan (which I am sure she will love), and reassure her that she didn't do anything wrong, you're not upset with her, and nothing has been lost in the plan revision (except maybe if you had paid a deposit on the photographer, I guess, but you don't seem too worried about that, so I'd still call it net neutral at minimum.) Shit happens, plans change, your relationship sounds much stronger than for anyone to be truly put out by a minor hiccup that you'll be laughing about at the wedding in a few years, and likely for the rest of your lives together.", "NAH, it sounds like a really sweet proposal, and it was honestly very thoughtful to change plans to she would be comfortable.", "No one is an AH.

No biggie, I planned something intimate the next week as a celebration for a new job I got and did it then, *THEN* I mentioned how I\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t do it in Utah where I\u2019m sure she was assuming (we\u2019d been together 6 years and it was an anniversary trip, she was connecting dots) but the ring wasn\u2019t ready. I\u2019m sure your GF would\u2019ve still felt \u201cguilty\u201d for causing you to not do it on this big trip, but it would\u2019ve been overshadowed by the fact that you were now happily engaged, I have no idea why you spoiled your plan to propose before you actually did it.\n\nSo I\u2019m going with NAH, her reaction is reasonable and I don\u2019t think you\u2019re an AH, more of a bit of a doofus.", "YTA Look, you sound like a good person and I'm sure that you love your girlfriend.

Yes, you could have photoshopped the pictures, but would her being blindsided after she spoke the truth cause other issues?

She is obviously so vocal about it, that it\u2019s highly probable any future kids you have will pick up on her insecurities. The kids are going to be asking why they can\u2019t take pictures of their mom only certain times of the month.\n\nYou guys are literally putting life events on hold because of these pimples. I think she needs a reality check at what kind of damage she\u2019s doing. Telling her your proposal plans was that reality check, even if she feels bad.\n\nInsecurities suck, but this one seem likes it stopping her from doing things she would otherwise do. Maybe she needs some help? Or see a doctor about the pimples?\n\nThat said, you guys are a team. So while making the trip special by having a surprise proposal would have been awesome, as soon as a wrench was thrown in the works, you should have revealed your cards. You guys could have communicated an alternative plan and still celebrated.", "NTA. I wouldn't enjoy life with a partner that hates pimples more than she loves and wants to be with me, but you do you", "NTA. This is literally why photoshop exists. The photos could have easily been touched up and no one would have known.", "NTA\n\nI wouldn't say this to her (for obvious reasons) but this might start to make her think differently about her insecurities. Maybe she'll rethink the whole \"I should look perfect for big events in life.\" And work on her insecurities. Life is too short to be focused on a couple of pimples during a proposal.\n\nYou were only trying to be considerate of her insecurities.", "Nta, maybe now shell.see a therapist for that absolutely bonkers level.of insecurity", "NTA. Her guilt isn\u2019t your fault", "Gonna assume you've never been proposed to. It's always the best memory ever, even if it's not on an international trip after a candlelit dinner.", "Idk this feels dismissive and a little harsh though. I can understand her discomfort. I think she's upset because her body was being a jerk at the wrong time and, even though that's not her fault, is blaming herself. I don't think she's an asshole either. Both people are understandably disappointed, but I don't think anyone was an asshole here. In a perfect world, gf would have a solid confidence and/or op would've tried to time her period cycle, but ... eh.", "I guess the hard part is we discussed getting engaged this year (which is why I think she made that comment on the trip). Whatever my backup plan will be, there\u2019s no way I can afford to equal what we just did financially a second time in the next 12 months unfortunately", "If you think neither of them is an asshole, you can vote NAH for No Assholes Here", "I mean, telling OP that he shouldn't have told her about his plan and why he didn't go through with it, because now she's \"gonna be carrying this guilt around forever\" isn't NOT an asshole move, IMO.", "I thought the same, but refrained from saying it to her-  I didn\u2019t want to add any guilt or stress on top of how she already felt", "I\u2019ll tell her at some point how disappointing this was. I mean I think she could tell just from my demeanor the rest of the trip, but I\u2019ve been trying to reassure her to assuage any guilt she\u2019s feeling", "She\u2019s not a big fan of social media (which is why I know she won\u2019t see this). It was more about \u201cthese are the photos we will have forever, the ones we will show our kids\u201d", "She\u2019s not high maintenance by any means. This is just her top insecurity (goes back to her teenage acne years), and it was a perfect storm of that being the thing that happens during the trip", "\ud83d\udcaf", "I ran out of characters in the post, but part of the reason I wanted to do a grand gesture is because she always sacrifices for others. This past holiday season, she used her bonus to buy her dad new work boots- that\u2019s the kind of person she is. She never expects anything in return, so that\u2019s why doing a grand gesture was my attempt at showing her the same spoiling and kindness that she shows all of us. She never would have asked for a grand gesture, that\u2019s why I think she feels as bad as she does about it", "While that's true, it's not okay to tell OP he shouldn't have told her at all because now she feels guilty. That's basically her blaming him for her decision.", "They\u2019re not that bad, but you know how our biggest insecurities can seem like \u201cvolcanoes\u201d", "Of course, I even joked about photoshop when I was trying to defuse things without revealing my plan. But she didn\u2019t like the idea of \u201cfiltering\u201d the moment. Even if I disagreed, I\u2019m not going to make her have a proposal she isn\u2019t comfortable having just because I can airbrush it. Maybe I\u2019m wrong, but I felt it should be on her terms", "I\u2019m stunned I had to read so long to find this. Such a simple solution \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "She did. I\u2019m the opposite of a \u201cwear your heart on your sleeve\u201d person physically, but even I had trouble hiding my discomfort and disappointment the final few days in my expressions", "She\u2019s not a vain person at all- which I know sounds ironic given the post. But this is her one blind spot. She had some rough acne as a teenager, so I feel she has lingering insecurities tied to that time, and these pimples bring back those bad feelings unfortunately", "Yeah I\u2019m trying my best to reassure her that there\u2019s no resentment in the hope that it kills any guilt she feels. Am I disappointed? Yes. But am I going to try again once this all dies down, even if it\u2019s not the one I envisioned for her? Absolutely", "She's right in blaming him for her feeling guilty over what was her decision?", "That\u2019s ridiculous. She fucked up. It\u2019s a damn pimple. She should absolutely take responsibility over it. Why should he have to hide the whole thing when she was the one who messed up", "That\u2019s fair. I mentioned it because she asked me directly once we got home why there was a \u201cweird vibe\u201d. Maybe I\u2019m a doofus, maybe I\u2019m cursed with Ned Stark-like loyalty to being honest, but I figured I\u2019d just be candid when asked directly", "It was still a wonderful trip and great memories were made, but the proposal idea was the impetus for me deciding to do the trip", "100% my husband was naked, drunk and babbling (had a drink to settle his nerves with some mutual friends. And then had many more!) It was perfect, because it was totally him.\n\nI'll add I was also quite tipsy and confused as I had been out on a girls night - that he knew about! - and he proposed when I got home. At 1am.", "I'm gonna also assume you've never been divorced. lol", "Agreed, I was proposed to while we were showering. He didn\u2019t even have a ring, so he used the one I was wearing. It was all him and a lovely surprise to boot. We picked out the formal engagement ring together later, which added a second sweet memory to have.", "But apparently not if you have a few pimples.", "Honestly I  think you guys are both putting too much pressure on yourselves. Weddings especially make people stress over so much little stuff that doesn't really matter.  Looking back now, I bet she doesn't care about the pimples and wishes she wouldn't have said anything. \n\nYou don't have to spend money, just put in effort. And PLEASE don't go into this with the idea that everything has to be perfect. Shit goes wrong all the time, that's life, but if you have the right partner you get to roll with the punches together.", "If you still want to propose this year and want to still do something special but affordable, I have some ideas.  Do you live near any free parks, gardens, or museums? Could be a nice outing and good for photos.  What did you guys do on your first date? Could you recreate it?  Another thing to consider is her interests.  Any favorite things that you could work in or get inspiration from.", "From your description, and I know it's hard to tell an entire relationship from a single reddit post lol, it sounds like she'll love whatever you do as long as you do it with love. You don't need to spend a lot of money on an elaborate plan to have a proposal be romantic. An intimate moment, whether it's private between you two or whether it's larger and just less expensive than a huge international vacation, is just as lovely without the huge price tag. She doesn't sound superficially materialistic, I am sure she will still say yes without the vacation-size expense attached to it.", "Bro, I don't know why you think a proposal has to be a massive thing that costs thousands of dollars. Take a sunset stroll somewhere with a great view, pop the question, then go have a nice dinner.  JFC, you already took an epic trip to Europe.", "Honetly she should feel bad.Do you want to spend your life with someone who is so wildly insecure she would derail your proposal over hormonal pimples? \n\nIf you guys have been talking about getting engaged she 10000% knew in her heart you were planning to propose on your trip. Me and my husband talked about it for a year and the first trip we took since talking about it I knew what was gonna happen.\n\nI feel so bad for you and she should absolutely feel guilty.\n\nThis is an every month thing there will be more insecure moments that she ruins because of her insecurities.", "Just propose at her apartment and That\u2019s it. She ruined it already.", "Doesn\u2019t have to be a vacation or anything like that take her to a special place that are for you too like first date or something like that", "I thought telling him not to propose was the first asshole move.\n\nShe needs to work on her insecurities. Maybe propose at a joint counseling session", "Why didn't you just drop the photographer? If pimples were the main factor", "My approach (which is worth what you paid for it), would be to tell her that, while you will forgive and move on from this, it doesn't take away the fact that it hurt. It's not your job to assuage her guilt, it's your job as her partner to be there for her afterwards as she works on making sure it doesn't happen again. Unconditional love/support doesn't mean forgetting, it means forgiving and working together to ensure it doesn't happen again. I'm positive, if she's a good partner, she never wants you to feel that way again.\n\nHonestly, I think it's good that she's feeling guilt - that's how she grows as a partner to you. You sound a lot like me in this regard. This is something I hard a hard time wrapping my head around for a long time: it's okay to have expectations of your partner and expect them to change/improve to meet your needs (within reason). I always felt I would give the world for my partner but felt guilty any time I expected her to change for or give to me. Turns out this was detrimental for both sides. Imagine she didn't tell you what she needed from you to be a better partner? That's what you're doing to her by not telling her what you need to feel better and meanwhile you'll silently build resentment that your needs aren't being met.", "I don't think you should tell her it's disappointing, she knows.\n\nNTA  \nShe straight up told you not to propose, you pushed back then followed her wish, she deserves to know you care about her enough to put in this effort.", "what matters more? The pictures, or moving forward with the life plan you two have?\n\nThere are plenty of ways to get beautiful pictures at home. Are there any view points, parks with beautiful scenery, a riverwalk, etc near your location? Maybe a place special to you both - where you first met? Can you set up a camping site under the stars in your backyard, etc?", "NTA- however this is so bazar to me. Ruining what could have been one of the most memorable/beautiful moments of your life\u2019s because of a pimple is insane. Pictures can be edited, that missed moment can not.", "Well now her guilt will be there for ever.", "Did she not realize that photos can be edited to remove blemishes?", "I understand but to then ask you she wishes you never told her because she can\u2019t handle being guilty? Is kind of selfish.. you also state you were upset but reassured her you won\u2019t which wasn\u2019t true and in the comments say the same.. idk, we all have our insecurities and I understand but to take away proposal and a vacation that cost a lot of money is kinda selfish and hurtful (imo)", "You sound very much in love. She told you not to do something which you did. You guys need to communicate that it's ok about not having that proposal.  And now you can do something local and very romantic. \n\n\nHonestly, what makes a proposal is the promise and commitment you're making. That means more than any kind of scenario.  There is no amount of flowers or pop and circumstances that could mean more than my partner telling me he wants a lifetime.  Asking to spend our lives together. \n\nIt's great you wanted to make it special.  But don't forget what matters most. \n\nIt's that promise that you want a lifetime together.", "You are very considerate. Filtering? It\u2019s not like you\u2019d be photoshopping a tinier waist. It\u2019s erasing blemishes that would be gone the next week anyway. It\u2019s a shame her insecurities are so deep-seated for something so easily fixed.", "She's too demanding; you plan something beautiful with a photographer because she demands one, she says not to propose on the trip you planned around a proposal. Photoshop can't be a thing because she won't be authentically perfect. \n\nThe trouble with her telling you not to propose is you're learning she's superficial at heart because image is more important to her than the heartfelt proposal. I'm now wondering if her selfless acts are purposeful to appear selfless. Yes, I'm that cynical.", "She literally filtered the moment herself.\n\nI can not say this enough she absolutely knew you were gonna propose on this trip like not a possible doubt.", "NTA then. While ideally you could have just kept it to yourself, once she asked you were certainly right to tell the truth instead of make up a lie.", "That\u2019s fair, I get you, I am also honest to a fault at times. And I meant doofus endearingly, I think you just kinda put your foot in your mouth with great intentions. If I were you I would\u2019ve tried to come up with a lie on the spot, but that can be tough especially for naturally honest people", "I\u2019m not gonna lie, that sounds way more realistic and personal (in the best way!) than a lot of the movie proposals. What a beautiful and honest way to start an engagement!", "If you don't love me at my naked, drunk, and babbling...", "Agreed, this is WAY overthinking. Also, the gf needs to work on her insecurities or they'll get worse.", "She loves nature so I\u2019m looking into private parks and botanical gardens nearby", "Yeah, fair. But I think blaming OP for the guilt she's feeling due to her own decision is a lot worse than what you said, so that's kinda what I focused on.", "Because she wants the proposal documented i.e. photos and video in the moment", "She likes nature, and thankfully there\u2019s plenty of it around us where we are. I\u2019m sure I can think of a backup location", "agreed.    I would be a little upset by this.    I defiantly wouldn't bother planning another proposal.   let her pick her perfect ring and where she wants the pictures taken.   Shes already agreed to marry it seems proposal is unnecessary.  He probably should have admitted everything as soon as she said not to.   she may have changed her mind after hearing what he had planned.", "> Well now her guilt will be there for ever.\n\nOr he can do an affordable but nice proposal close to home, she can accept, and they can move on with their lives with no need for any guilt at all.", "I mentioned it in other comments but it stems from acne during her teen years, and I think anytime these pimples occur it brings out those negative feelings of self worth all over again", "OP has explicitly said that she did not ask for a grand gesture of a proposal nor expected one - *he* wanted to do the grand gesture. That was his idea.", "Yeah thanks. I considered it for a split second but I\u2019m a terrible liar anyways- blinking, blushing, stammering, the works", "Ooooohhh that sounds gorgeous! Flower crowns, making wishes.... flowers have huge symbolism, there's so much meaningful fun things you could do! Offer her a flower to smell that has the engagement ring on/in it, a picnic, etc... anyway, sorry, flowers are great and I got excited for you lol!\n\nTry not to stress *too* much, I think you both are doing just fine :)", "That sounds lovely!", "I don\u2019t know what your budget is after your big trip or where you live but a roadtrip to a national park would be relatively cheap", "I feel like this relationship is doomed because she put so much pressure on him. It's always going to be his fault because she knows she ruined the romantic proposal w photographer and video Grapher. \n\nShe'll be lucky to get a proposal in a park with a selfie nafter wasting the proposal trip", "In the future, I would let her know that professional photographers can edit photos. She can also wear makeup before big events. I understand that it can be difficult to feel your best when you don't look your best. I had acne as a teenager too. It's tough. However, it's unreasonable to reshedule everything due to 1 or 2 zits everytime.", "Is she this controlling about other things?", "Go for it! The best part is she might be completely surprised, compared to a planned international vacation.", "That is a shame. If it\u2019s still bad, she should try Accutane. My friends have done it as adults and it\u2019s worked miracles.", "Is wanting photos and video of your proposal controlling? That seems pretty reasonable", "Wanting perfection to the point that she told you not to propose on what she believed was your proposal trip. How much money did you lose by canceling? \n\nWill she postpone your wedding if she has pimples?", "Considering she told you not to propose because of pimples on a romantic trip after talking about getting engaged. \n\nYes she seems very very insecure and controlling.", "You\u2019re a good boyfriend, don\u2019t listen to these people lol some commenters don\u2019t know how life works"]}
