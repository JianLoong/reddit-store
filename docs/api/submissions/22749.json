{"id": 22749, "submission_id": "154uuky", "title": "AITA for telling my girlfriend about my cancelled proposal plan?", "selftext": "My girlfriend (F27) and I (M27) have been dating for five years now, and things have been perfect. The number one thing I love about her is her selflessness towards her loved ones. She is also not someone who is demanding for the \u201cfiner things\u201d due to her selflessness, but I always try to spoil her regardless. \n\nMy girlfriend is not a vain person, but she has an insecurity around her tendency to develop some small pimples on her cheeks and chin during her period. It never bothers me, but she hates them.\n\nWell, about nine months ago we planned an international trip together. I wanted to give her an idealistic proposal since she always does so much for everyone else. I had arranged for a candlelit dinner near a famous landmark at the destination. Afterwards, we were going to walk over to a gazebo, and I was going to propose. I had booked the dinner and even hired a photographer.\n\nFast forward to the actual trip, and something we hadn\u2019t accounted for was her period. Unfortunately, two days before my planned proposal it arrived. She said she felt bloated, but otherwise we were still able to enjoy those days of the trip. However, she did develop some pimples.\n\nWhile walking around town the morning of the proposal, she said to me in a teasing way \u201cplease don\u2019t propose while I\u2019m covered in pimples.\u201d I played along and laughed, but I felt my heart racing, so I feigned playfulness and said \u201cOver a few pimples?\u201d And she got a little more serious, saying she wasn\u2019t sure if I planned on doing it during the trip, but that she didn\u2019t want such a romantic moment to have a blemish. I tried to push back without revealing my plan, but I could tell she was sincere and could see her insecurity taking over. I had no idea what to do, but I didn\u2019t want to create resentment in her over what was supposed to be her fairytale moment, so I cancelled all but the dinner. Admittedly, there was a weird vibe the rest of the trip, despite my best efforts.\n\nWhen we got home, we finally addressed the weird vibe. I came clean and told her about my plan. I even made sure to express to her that I wasn\u2019t upset (not entirely true). After I told her, her eyes welled up, and she said she was sorry for ruining my plan. However, she mentioned that I should have never told her about this, because now she\u2019s going to carry this guilt forever (her words) since that was the main purpose for taking an expensive international trip together.\n\nI always thought being open was right, but now I feel awful for creating guilt inside of her. I do also feel upset for the plan being squashed by something that could be photoshopped, but I\u2019m trying to respect her insecurities. Also, the last thing I want to do right now is pile onto her guilt. Was it dumb to come clean?", "created_utc": 1689868552, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/154uuky/aita_for_telling_my_girlfriend_about_my_cancelled/", "score": 820, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I told my girlfriend about my cancelled proposal plan after an expensive international trip.\n\n2. I unintentionally have made her feel guilty, as the reason I cancelled the plan was due to a comment she made about not wanting to have her proposal while covered in pimples.

It was just unfortunate timing about something she's really insecure about.  \n\nI don't know what the \"perfect\" response would have been. But now that it's happened, you can only deal with what's in front of you now.  \n\nI would suggest telling her that there will be other trips in your future together.

What's her plan if she gets her period on your wedding day?", "NTA - honestly dude if you're at the point of cancelling a proposal (at her request and insecurity) over pimples that she gets every month, she really needs to see a doctor to address the pimples (different birth control, skincare route, etc) or see a mental health expert to help her learn to be okay with it.\n\nYou literally followed and did what she asked you to... then she got mad because you did that and shared it, because it's a HUGE thing to have to cancel at the last minute and left both of you in a weird mood. It's completely fair in a marriage to be able to share your feelings if your partner did something to upset you. Even if they don't want to hear it, you need to be able to share it for your own mental health and to not build up resentment.", "NTA.  secrets are worse than the truth.    if you guys have already agreed to marry what is the point of an elaborate proposal.   I would let her pick out a ring and then go to a place of her choosing for social media posts which I assume was the reason for the pimples comment.", "NTA. She sounds exhausting lmao", "Nta\n\n\nShe has deep insecurities. Unfortunately, that means she wasn't comfortable with the dream proposal scenario. Too bad. \n\n\n\nSide note. I think there is a certain level of unrealistic expectations regarding the proposal and circumstances in your post.\n\n\nIt sounds very superficial to me. Personally, when my bf does propose and I am in pjs. I would be over the moon. You could always take another photo. \n\nWhat matters most is the promise, not the photos.", "NAH.\n\nYour girl has major self esteem issues clearly.

That being said, you did exactly as she asked - you didn\u2019t propose while she had pimples. And that was her choice because of her insecurities, and she needs to own that. The \u201cguilt\u201d she now has isn\u2019t your fault. \u201cYou should never have told me\u201d isn\u2019t a reasonable thing for her to ask for because 1.

There's also a lot of pressure on you to make it perfect. \nI think you both need to breathe and shake off the pressure. No one's proposal is perfect, that's honestly part of the fun of proposal stories. Find a way to laugh about it together. It's good practice for the wedding because something goes wrong at every wedding (my purple wedding cake arrived icy blue and my MOH got lipstick on my dress. Stuff happens haha).

This is why I feel weird about big proposals anyway - they place such a huge amount of pressure on a moment being perfect. But you couldn't have done anything else after she explicitly told you not to propose, and her insecurity doesn't mean you have to swallow your own feelings. You must be disappointed that this thing you planned was effectively ruined, right? \n\nMaybe some therapy would help her work through her feelings around her image, and maybe there's a way to move forward in your relationship without the pressure of a perfectly photographed moment.

How bored are you people?", "I really think people need to calm down about their proposals. I can\u2019t imagine telling someone not to propose while on a romantic, international vacation bc of some pimples. I feel bad that you had such a wonderful proposal planned and something dumb ruined it.", "NAH\n\nShe's upset because her body was being a jerk at the exact wrong time and is taking responsibility onto her own shoulders when it's not her fault, hence the misplaced guilt. It sucks, but her feelings are reasonable and make a lot of sense.\n\nI don't think telling her was wrong either, though. I'm a huge fan of openness. If I were you, I'd try to word something like, \"there's no need to feel guilty, love. It's not your fault at all, and I care very much about your comfort and boundaries which is why I thought to wait. Even though it didn't work out this time, it was a dream to get to spend such a magical vacation with you. I told you because I value our openness with each other, and I want to reassure you that the opportunity to have a wonderful proposal moment hasn't passed or expired\".

It was very considerate of you to put her wants over yours in the moment AND it's okay to be feeling a little upset about it. It's also okay that you told her. She probably is feeling bad about putting you through the extra effort and may need a little encouragement that she is worth that and so much more. \n\nAt the end of the day, your proposal is going to be great no matter the time or place, or what is on her face.", "NAH\n\nI see that you're worried about not being able to plan/afford another ideal and romantic trip, and that's a sensitive topic. Maybe you should reframe what's important about a proposal - It's about sharing the things you love with the person you love.\n\nYou could surprise her with a proposal built around an entirely different but fun day. Go get your favorite ice cream or something and propose in a lovely park. And let it show that every experience, grand or simple, is made better with her.", "NAH. idk why everyone thinks the gf willingly ruined OP\u2019s proposal. Op did nothing wrong by not proposing after being told not to. it\u2019s unfortunate, but y\u2019all are acting like she could gaze into the future, see the proposal and actively decide to ruin it because of a few pimples. Even if she had a feeling he was going to propose, she didn\u2019t know for sure! Insecurities exist, and they suck. Hopefully, Op and his girlfriend can learn from this and whatever/whenever the proposal comes it will be even more special.", "NAH. I understand why she feels bad, but imo, the purpose of the international trip was to have a good time and make good memories, which you did! And the proposal would have just been a cherry on top.\n\nYou can still have a wonderful, romantic proposal, no expensive vacation required, *and* you had a lovely trip that sounds like you both enjoyed the hell out of. Now you'll get two wonderful memories instead of just one!\n\nI'm sure in time, she'll stop blaming herself, since you don't seem to be blaming her. For now, focus on the positives, concoct your new (pimple-free) plan (which I am sure she will love), and reassure her that she didn't do anything wrong, you're not upset with her, and nothing has been lost in the plan revision (except maybe if you had paid a deposit on the photographer, I guess, but you don't seem too worried about that, so I'd still call it net neutral at minimum.) Shit happens, plans change, your relationship sounds much stronger than for anyone to be truly put out by a minor hiccup that you'll be laughing about at the wedding in a few years, and likely for the rest of your lives together.", "NAH, it sounds like a really sweet proposal, and it was honestly very thoughtful to change plans to she would be comfortable.", "No one is an AH.

No biggie, I planned something intimate the next week as a celebration for a new job I got and did it then, *THEN* I mentioned how I\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t do it in Utah where I\u2019m sure she was assuming (we\u2019d been together 6 years and it was an anniversary trip, she was connecting dots) but the ring wasn\u2019t ready. I\u2019m sure your GF would\u2019ve still felt \u201cguilty\u201d for causing you to not do it on this big trip, but it would\u2019ve been overshadowed by the fact that you were now happily engaged, I have no idea why you spoiled your plan to propose before you actually did it.\n\nSo I\u2019m going with NAH, her reaction is reasonable and I don\u2019t think you\u2019re an AH, more of a bit of a doofus.", "YTA Look, you sound like a good person and I'm sure that you love your girlfriend.

Yes, you could have photoshopped the pictures, but would her being blindsided after she spoke the truth cause other issues?

Unless you want to revolve every significant moment in your life around a few pimples\u2026", "NTA - why would the pictures of your engagement be more important than the declaration of love? When did the photo become more important than the emotion? I am old so perhaps I just don't get it... my proposal was just the two of us. And it was perfect.", "NAH, there is nobody to blame for this, it's just an unfortunate situation. \n\nI think you did the right thing in coming clean, it sounds like you have a healthy relationship and honesty is part of that. She's not an AH for expressing her emotions and neither are you for explaining the weird vibe. The only bad thing here is you're gonna have to get creative with a new proposal plan!", "NTA\n\nSo no you shouldn\u2019t have lied to her about what caused the weird vibe on vacation. \n\nShe is welcome to feel guilty about it but also she needs to recognize you love her so much you listened.  \n\nSo now you get out the calendar, avoid when those pesky pimples appear, pick a date and make it something fun that you both enjoy that proposing will be the best way to close out the day.  \n\nIt won\u2019t be the proposal you originally planned but it will still be memorable.", "NTA\n\nYou took her feeling into consideration and tried to make the best out of the trip. Things happen. Maybe you should have just pushed through and done it. Either way you did what you thought was best at the time.\n\nAs for telling her you admit there was uneasy tension and that after the trip you both wanted to talk about it. It is better to be truthful and honest with your partner. Now when you propose you can make it a big event with all your friends and family. You also pretty much got the yes since you told her your plans and she didn't react badly to it. Just that she feels bad for ruining it.", "NAH.\n\nI get the insecurity thing. I get being disappointed, too, but you're not the AH for telling the truth. Nor is she one for feeling bad that you told her. \n\nIt's just an unfortunate set of circumstances. \n\nWhen your GF is feeling better about the whole thing, do mention that professional photos are more often than not, touched up. Lighting is fixed. Blemishes are removed. Backgrounds are massaged, so you don't have something weird and distracting (like a kid making a face) in the photo. All that. Because blemishes might happen on a wedding day or whatnot, and it'll be much more of a hassle to call that off, you know?", "NTA kinda, depends on one detail.\n\nNor is she.\n\nI think this so just a case of her feeling irrationally guilty that your very thoughtful plans didn't quite pan out properly, and she wants to look her best for you when you make such a grand move.\n\nIf you still hadn't proposed yet when you told about this, that was a mistake. It leaves her as a strange Schroedinger's fiance, knowing that you would have by now but haven't.\n\nHonestly, she sounds like a keeper and is clearly smitten with you. If you still intend to marry her and haven't proposed yet, fix that. It doesn't need to be another expense affair but in a setting that she can get dressed up for.\n\nAnd if she's still upset about he original botched plan, make it clear to her that one perfect moment pales in comparison to a lifetime with her.\n\nLife doesn't ways go to plan, and that's when you really build a strong marriage.", "NAH. She told you not to propose, you didn\u2019t propose. Maybe that was fates way of saying this wasn\u2019t the time yet. When it is, it\u2019s not going to matter where you guys are, it will always be a special moment.", "Well ain't that some BS? So it's okay that your proposal was ruined, it's okay that she said something to change everything but it's not okay that you told her about it because now she's going to feel guilty. So it would have been okay that she ruined everything as long as she didn't feel guilty about it? Look I know we say red flag in here a lot but holy crap ... That's a big one! So it's okay that she ruined everything as long as she doesn't know she ruined everything so she doesn't feel guilty about it. What a horrible way to live your life. Horrible to the people around you I mean!\n\nYou are NTA and the best part was she was completely okay with you changing your plans over a couple of tiny little pimples, but she just didn't want to know about it.

I've accidentally ruined things like that, asking to absolutely not get something that someone had already gotten for me, and that taught me to keep my mouth shut.

Maybe she should see a therapist.", "NAH...But it sounds as if she really needs to address those emotional issues.", "NTA.  All on her for opening her mouth about it.", "Neither of you are assholes for this. I think being honest was the right thing to do, especially because she had specifically told you *not* to propose and you listened to her request. Personally, I think you and her should sit down and have a heart to heart about how each of you are feeling about this. You can tell her why you felt she deserved to know about your plan on proposing and let her know you still want to! Maybe plan a  romantic evening to help get her confidence back up and let her know she's beautiful, pimples or no. I wish the both of you much happiness! I hope your real proposal goes well! Good luck!", "NTA\n\nShe asked a question, and giving her an honest answer was perfectly reasonable. Making up a lie would have only further complicated things and been a potential landmine in your relationship.\n\nShe really should stop saying things she doesn't mean or not meaning things that she says. Also, if she wants to have a surprise proposal, then she needs to accept that it might happen when she has pimples. It's not the sort of thing that can be planned around.", "NAH\n\nIf you went through with it, she would have loved it but also been upset. She literally TOLD you this.

She wouldn't have felt guilty about it even knowing she ruined the proposal until he mentioned it. That's messed up", "No!   No it isn't always!\n\n\nMade a throwaway for the very recognizable very well known story amongst my friend group.   \n\nPrepare for my hell.  \n\nI had been with boyfriend for 5 years.  He had lied and told me he was graduating that year with me.  I had a job lined up after college and it was finals week.  We had discussed marriage and I told him ***UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES*** was he to propose until after school was over.  I had the worst finals week ahead of me and senior design projects to finish and presentations to practice.  The last thing I wanted was to parade around to family when I needed to be studying.  It would make my finals week hell. \n\nLet me be totally clear - he only had to wait one week and a few days until finals were done.   Less than 10 days!  I thought it was reasonable!   And it didn't even have to be then if he wanted to wait longer.  I wasn't in any rush.  \n\nI told him don't bother me that week and the days before it because I was working and studying.  I also knew he needed to do well on his exams (didn't know that it didn't matter how well he did because he would fail even with 100s on the finals because he had been skipping all his classes including exams).   \n\nSo the DAY before my biggest final he insists I need to go out to eat with him.   I had food at the apartment (we roomed with another couple).  I didn't have to leave.  He insisted.  I caved.  I regret that decision over a decade later.  \n\nHe takes me ***to a park*** with no food.  He insists on walking around the park first.   I literally can't get anywhere without him so I tell him we have to leave in 10 minutes or I'm calling a friend to get me.  I'm in a dirty t-shirt and gym shorts.  My hair is a mess.   He's in a t-shirt with holes in it and gym shorts.   We walk around this duck pond while I'm telling him I really need to get back to studying. [Forgot to add for scenery - the pond was yucky brown/green with goose shit EVERYWHERE.  It was so smelly and disgusting.  I was trying to dodge the piles of shit on the path while walking and telling him we need to leave.]\n\n He stops me and gets down on one knee ***on the walking path*** with no warning (yes, into the goose shit).  A large man that was jogging (man was killing it, hope he's doing well because he obviously was working out hard and based on his oversized clothes had probably already lost a lot of weight) had to dodge/jump to the side because my BF did it right in front of him.  \n\nI was so pissed.  The ONE thing I asked for was not to do it until ONE WEEK LATER.  I was sweaty!  I was stressed!  I knew I'd have to visit the two families because they both parade newly engaged couples around.  \n\nHoly shit I was pissed.  For some reason I hyperfixated on the fact that he nearly tripped the jogging guy.  I was SO PISSED he didn't even pay attention to surroundings enough to notice he nearly hurt someone.  \n\nI was embarrassed and a crowd formed from people that had been around the park.  My BF was saying a bunch of stuff but honestly I couldn't even hear him because I was so pissed.  \n\nThen he brings out a ring that was opposite of everything I told him I liked.  Like it was made to be everything I hated.  The stone was weirdly shaped and gawdy.  The band was rose gold and it was just a weird rock on a basic band.  I remember thinking that the rock was huge so he must have spent a lot of money on something that he ***knew*** I would hate.  Like I gave him a list of things I liked and things I hated.   It was titled \"Do not get these\".  I didn't even want a large stone! \n\nI felt so embarrassed by the crowd and stupidly said yes to make it all move along.  Like, I'm stuck there because he drove me.  He has complete control of the situation and people are all excited around us.   People clapped which made me feel even worse.  We got to the restaurant and I'm telling him to keep it a secret and not tell people.  We knew people thag worked there.  He told everyone.  I'm telling him to be quiet and we will talk at home.  \n\n[Forgot to add - yes family tried to demand time during my week and I gave one dinner where people could meet up but no more.  Turns out he proposed then because he knew all his lies were going to come crashing down and he wanted me \"locked down\" before I found out everything was a lie.  Yeah no.  Bye asshole]\n\nIt took me another month to officially break it off.  Every person I knew said \"thank God, that guy was a moron\" when I told them I broke it off.   \n\nTurns out he didn't graduate.  He did pretend to, though, and accepted graduation gifts from people.   My parents gave him a really nice car emergency kickstarter/jumper battery with flares and emergency stuff.  I took it with me during the split.  \n\n [Edit to add: this paragraph was how he started acting after the proposal, which he never had acted like before it]  He expected me to work and pay for everything.  He started talking about being a stay at home husband with no kids or really any responsibilities (he wanted to play video games all day, which is also why he skipped all his classes).  He also wanted me to start popping out babies very soon.  He wanted 4.   He never helped when we watched his neice so I knew I would have to do all the work.  \n\nThe kicker was that during school I was working 20 hours a week plus had 6 classes going at once plus senior design.  So I was busy from 7am to 10pm.   I had no idea he was doing any of this shit.  I didn't know he was failing because he lied.  I didn't know he was trying to get me pregnant (yay birth control).  I didn't know he directly told people \"ah, she's gonna be an engineer, she'll make enough for both of us.  I don't need a job\".   I didn't know he had borrowed money from people.  I didn't know he was stealing the food our roommates made and passed it off as him cooking.  I didn't know he played video games from the moment I left until right before I got back.  I didn't know my roommates were picking up his slack on chores.    I found out after graduation and being home during the day for once.  And I saw how absolutely shitty he really was when I was working my ass off.  \n\nBroke that off.  \n\nI'm now happily engaged a decade later to a man that's actually a mature adult that gives a shit about me and what I want.  His proposal was super sweet and amazing.  \n\nBut anyways.  Yes.  Proposals can be absolutely shitty if they ignore everything you have ever said.   If OP had proposed after she said she didn't want it to happen, it would have gone badly.\n\nThank you for coming to my TED Talk.  Moral of the story folks - don't be a doormat.

Don't do what I did.", "We had a mutual friend who while I was out to lunch with did the whole \"I know when it's going to happen\" teasing thing.

She's just mad she knows because now she feels guilty because she ruined the whole thing. That's the ridiculousness of this all! She's okay she ruined it she's just mad that she feels upset that she ruined it and she's blaming him.", "It sounds like your marriage ended...  but was the second proposal at least a little passable?\n\nAnd yeah I agree there are many situations where a do-over proposal is not out of line.  Doesn't actually apply to OP's situation because he didn't actually propose!   And his comments describe in detail her insecurities around pimples stem from bad acne during teenage-hood so I definitely sympathize with her for that.", "God it was nuts how well he constructed his lies.  And it was all built around my work/class schedule keeping me out of the apartment so long so I never saw what he was really doing.   \n\nHe proposed before graduation because he knew I'd find out he didn't graduate.   He wanted me \"locked down\" before I found out he was a giant liar so he could push for us to have counseling ***from his parents***. \n\nThey had a dinner where they lectured at ***ME*** for letting their darling boy fail.  They lectured him for a while before turning to me again!   Like I was supposed to spoonfeed him his class work when I was working or in class from 7am-10pm.  \n\nHilariously that \"intervention\" that was meant to break me down to \"take responsibility\" for him led me to break up with him.  Like it set off the lightbulb of \"this is insane, why am I still here?\"  I hadn't let him drive me anywhere after the pond incident because I was scared he'd pull something else I couldn't leave. \n\n I told his mom that I didn't fail and they were the ones that raised him so if he had issues then that was on them.  Then I drove off and went back to the apartment without him.  Luckily my new apartment was ready a couple weeks later and once I had all my stuff safely away from him I gave the ring back and broke up with him.   \n\nJesus that guy was nuts.  He had it all hidden when I was at home (the few hours I wasn't sleeping).  I thought he was working as hard as I was!   He was just playing games all day.  \n\n----\n\nCurrent fiance is a serious catch though.  He's brilliant, funny, handsome as hell, works hard, openly talks finances and such with me, and does nice things for me because he wants me to be happy.   He was worth the wait.", "\u201cHah! She\u2019ll be too distraught to say no!\u201d", "Yessss!", "I agree, there isn\u2019t a moment I don\u2019t have a pimple somewhere, and I\u2019m 33. It\u2019s life and like OP said, pimples can be edited out of photos so easily these days!", "They obviously work, and travel, well together but if buddy doesn't get up off his ass and propose, they might not be together for too much longer, LOL.", "A hike if she likes hiking maybe? You (or have someone else) could go early and set up a cute, low budget setup spot to propose at the end of the hike so when y\u2019all get to the top she\u2019ll be surprised.", "One of the nicest proposal pics  I\u2019ve ever seen was at a botanical garden during a butterfly exhibition.", "Oh good lord", "I didn't say she asked for a grand gesture; she asked for a photographer and videographer for the proposal, he chose the location and she told him not to propose\nPersonally, I think a proposal where you're requesting a lot of money be spent memorializing it makes it a grand gesture.", "Personally, I'm more in love with the idea of the proposee looking away at something (a flower) and the proposer getting down on one knee with a ring while the other person isn't looking. Then the proposee turns around and BAM. Proposal. (Rather than ring-hidden-in-something. Again. Personal preference. Depends what OP's GF would want lol.)", "Take a hike to a nice place to watch the sunrise. Tell her you want to start every day with her forever.", "Idk why you got downvoted for this but I was wondering the same thing why she didn\u2019t go to the doc to help her skin or bring makeup if she knew there was a chance of a proposal (like she mentioned)", "A photographer and a videographer don\u2019t have to be professional, it could just as easily be friends or family. *He* chose to have the proposal be a grand, international gesture. The biggest costs were his decision, and they were intentionally his decision because he *wanted* it to be grand and expensive.", "Ooooh that's also a fun idea! Honestly there's so many great options, and it sounds like (to me) op cares enough to make it special for her \u263a\ufe0f", "Wanting the photos and videos to be 100% perfect and not reflective of actual, real-life is not reasonable at all.  It's a clear sign of control issues.\n\nThis also directly affected your happiness.  You can't share with her how you are feeling about the failure of your plan, because she'll just guilt you more over it.  That's controlling.", "So far your proposal has to be when she is blemish free AND must be documented. Also you were just supposed to carry this secret around with you forever in order to avoid her feeling guilt...for her actual actions.  Yeah dude, sounds kind of controlling/at minimum in need of some therapy.  You even admit you don't feel like you can bring up what will happen if this coincides with your wedding because you fear her reaction.  That plain isn't healthy.", "She sounds like a pain, it should be an honor to be asked. There should not be any additional requirements. why can't she just be happy you are asking.", "But even though he planned a grand gesture, she shot it down. \n\nHer insecurity and inability to take responsibility for refusing his proposal will likely end their relationship.", "Of course not!\n\nOP now knows that he has to plan everything around those few days of every single month. For the next 40 odd years.\n\nSeems reasonable enough. \n\n##***/s***", "She didn\u2019t shoot down a grand gesture, she asked not to be proposed to in the moment because she felt self-conscious and didn\u2019t want to ruin it. She didn\u2019t know for sure what his plans were - nor the cost - until *after* the trip when he had told her. \n\nAnd, frankly, that\u2019s part of the risk with huge grand gestures. Was it well thought of? Absolutely. But to treat it as if *she* was the one who asked for him to spend a large sum of money only to shoot it down is disingenuous.", "That's not how periods work tho. Stress can result in erratic periods and can also cause acne.", "40 years? Don't most women stop having periods at around 40?", "Perimenopause may start between 35 and 55. Some women have periods into their late 50s.", "This woman is already well into her 20s.\n\n(Tho, early 40s was when my mom started menopause)", "51 here and I think I had my last one last year ... It'll be another year till we're sure though. That's about the normal age anyway."]}
