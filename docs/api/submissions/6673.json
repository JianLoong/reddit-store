How many posts on here are from \"unfavoured\" children talking about their extended families or parents treating a sibling more favourably? We always support those guys. Yet here people are not supporting the 3 year old girl. \n\nThis is not her fault. She's still your family. You don't need to invite the girlfriend - her FATHER and GRANDPARENTS are there for the 3 year old...\n\nBut, you know... You guys don't seem to want a relationship with your own blood.", "NTA.", "All the E S H and saying OP is T A is really blowing my mind! \n\nOP is absolutely NTA! First off OP is a grown woman and chose to invite/include or NOT to invite/include whoever she pleases... That's the beauty of being an adult with freewill.\n\nIt is clear OP is not making her decisions out of malice, quite the opposite actually, she's being considerate and sensitive to her SIL's & Nibling's feelings and to the gravity of the waking nightmare that they're perpetually trapped in.\n\nThose saying that the niece shouldn't be \"punished\" and \"excluded\" because of what her parents did are absolutely, unequivocally correct!\n\nWhat everyone saying this should take a moment to step back & recognize is that OP & her parents are NOT \"punishing\" NOR \"excluding\" her.\n\nBut, it seems that everyone is in such a hurry to eviscerate OP that they're missing the MOST important and OBVIOUS point here...  That. Is. NOT. OP's. NOR. Her. Parents. Responsibility.\n\nMaybe I missed it but, I don't recall seeing any comments recognizing that this Little One is NOT OP's child! \n\nShe is OP's BROTHER'S child. She is HIS responsibility. It is HIS responsibility the make sure that she is included in HIS family's gatherings. It is HIS responsibility to encourage and foster relationships between HIS child and the rest of HIS family.\n\nBut to double back to why I felt I HAD to comment; \n\nFirst the commenters telling OP she should be inviting the niece, and \"SIL needs to suck it up & get over it\",\nOBVIOUSLY have NEVER been married; going through the ups & downs, the good & the bad, the smooth & the rough yet always coming out on the other end- not perfect but, together, still each other Person (in my case for Damn near 18 years, together since I was 18) and then one day have your SOUL ripped out of your body and  watch as it's ground to dust and blows away in the gut punch of the one breath it takes to utter the words that YOUR husband has had a baby with ANOTHER WOMAN... There is NOTHING that can prepare you for something like that. \n\nYou DON'T ever \"get over\" something like that. Yes, with time, prayer, resolve, and the right mental health support one can move forward from it and live a healthy happy life BUT, it's ALWAYS in the recesses of your mind & spirit. \nWe're not talking about a broken toy that she can just cry over, have a sucker and everything is right as rain afterwards - it takes time, as much time as SIL needs. Depending on how old SIL & brother's children are they ALSO may need time to adjust to this new dynamic/reality.\n\n\nThis is an EXTREMELY delicate situation and there's NO \"simple\", straightforward, or cut & dry solutions. \n\nAlso as another commenter pointed out, everyone is throwing up the \"she's going to feel excluded\" flag,\nFirst, HOW can she feel excluded from that which she doesn't know? \n\nSecond, WHO is going to tell her she's being excluded if she's not around to know/see/feel \"excluded\"?? \n\nFurthermore though, it doesn't seem as though there might be am issue with the niece being a part of (some) family gatherings, it's her mother - brother's GF that's not invited. I also get a strong sense that the GF has been trying to insinuate into the family fold for a loOong while now. \n \n\n>so I have to stop excluding them, especially since she isn't going anywhere and her daughter is our family too\n\n>his girlfriend is angry that her and her daughter have been continuously excluded for the last 3 years. \n\n\nAs, I pointed out earlier, OP doesn't \"have\" to do a D*mn thing. I have a very strong suspicion that the GF is far more concerned with HERSELF being excluded. I have no doubt that, in her mind- whether OP's brother led her to believe it or she just THAT delusional, she expected that as soon the family found out she was pregnant that they would unceremoniously toss SIL & her kids in the trash and welcome GF into the family.\n\n\nSince that didn't happen, she's now trying to manipulate and guilt her way into family by way of her daughter as an \"All or Nothing\" package. Because who gives 2 D*mns, if \"she's not going anywhere\" or that she's angry that SHE'S been \"continuously excluded\"?!\n\n\nYes, her DAUGHTER is, their family NOT her... And her daughter has TWO parents SoOo, there's NO reason why her daughter has to be \" excluded \" other than, 1. SHE insists that she just HAS to go along when/if her daughter visits with the family or, 2. OP's Brother, her daughter FATHER, is making NO effort to make it happen! \n\nWhich leads me to back to the other major point, the girlfriend (and many commenters) are blaming OP & her family for the \"exclusion\" and berating them BUT, who she SHOULD be taking this up with is HER BABY DADDY! That's HIS family and if she was REALLY simply concerned about her daughter being able to spend time and bond with her father's side of the family then GF SHOULD be discussing it with HIM. \nThen, if it's still not happening, she's should be berating HIM and accusing HIM of excluding and alienating their daughter from his side of the family! \n\nThat is STRICTLY between THEM, the child's PARENT'S - THEN the brother can make whatever arrangements need to be made with HIS family for his daughter to spend time with them. \n\nSorry for the rant OP, I just really felt that the negative comments towards you were absolutely unfair to you. It seems that you care, if not, I doubt you would made the post in the first place. Also, I recognized and very much respect that you never spoke negatively off your brother, his girlfriend or, their situation. I'm sure you have your opinions on that but, you stayed focused on what's really just important right now- doing right by your SIL & Nibling's but, at the same time, getting outside perspective on how you're handling the situation as a whole. \nI don't believe you have any issue with your niece, she's just a child after all and none of this is her fault, but you also recognize that this is a very tricky and delicate situation for all involved. \n\nStay Well OP. Your SIL is very blessed to have your support and Love. \ud83d\udc9c", "Soft YTA, depending on the answers to: why is it up to you who to invite?\n\nIf I am hosting something in my home, I get to decide who is invited.

If brother is coming then he would have to do 100% of the care which I doubt he would.", "I mean, even if they did, he broke that rule so it\u2019s still some audacity on brother\u2019s part.", "OP is excluding the niece born of the affair, she's going to see her extended family close to her half-siblings but not wanting her around.", "Thank you for saying that so succinctly. \n\nSIL probably has little to no issue with the kid beyond the fact that it\u2019s a child her husband has with another woman while married to her. \n\nIf I was OP, I would say that my brother can bring his affair child as long as his wife is still comfortable. His wife and her kids are the victims here and I think allowing them to enjoy their VACATION without reminders of their husbands/fathers betrayal being brought along is not only reasonable but also necessary and deserved. \n\nThat being said I can\u2019t understand the audacity of mistress\u2019 who complain \u201cI\u2019m not being treated like part of the family!\u201d  \nIf she hadn\u2019t gotten pregnant, and his wife hadn\u2019t kicked him out, all she would ever be is the mistress. He didn\u2019t \u201cchoose\u201d her for anything other than the affair - he had nowhere else to go after he got caught.", "I didn\u2019t say if OP\u2019s brother wasn\u2019t an asshole or was right. I was just saying that they could be polyamorous with him breaking a rule."]}
