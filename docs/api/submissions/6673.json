If she doesn't want a divorce for some reason, then she should at least let her husband get on with his life, as their marriage is clearly over...so OP should be treating the wife as the EX wife.)

You don't need to invite the girlfriend - her FATHER and GRANDPARENTS are there for the 3 year old...\n\nBut, you know... You guys don't seem to want a relationship with your own blood.", "NTA.", "All the E S H and saying OP is T A is really blowing my mind! \n\nOP is absolutely NTA! First off OP is a grown woman and chose to invite/include or NOT to invite/include whoever she pleases... That's the beauty of being an adult with freewill.\n\nIt is clear OP is not making her decisions out of malice, quite the opposite actually, she's being considerate and sensitive to her SIL's & Nibling's feelings and to the gravity of the waking nightmare that they're perpetually trapped in.\n\nThose saying that the niece shouldn't be \"punished\" and \"excluded\" because of what her parents did are absolutely, unequivocally correct!\n\nWhat everyone saying this should take a moment to step back & recognize is that OP & her parents are NOT \"punishing\" NOR \"excluding\" her.\n\nBut, it seems that everyone is in such a hurry to eviscerate OP that they're missing the MOST important and OBVIOUS point here...  That. Is. NOT. OP's. NOR. Her. Parents. Responsibility.\n\nMaybe I missed it but, I don't recall seeing any comments recognizing that this Little One is NOT OP's child! \n\nShe is OP's BROTHER'S child. She is HIS responsibility. It is HIS responsibility the make sure that she is included in HIS family's gatherings. It is HIS responsibility to encourage and foster relationships between HIS child and the rest of HIS family.\n\nBut to double back to why I felt I HAD to comment; \n\nFirst the commenters telling OP she should be inviting the niece, and \"SIL needs to suck it up & get over it\",\nOBVIOUSLY have NEVER been married; going through the ups & downs, the good & the bad, the smooth & the rough yet always coming out on the other end- not perfect but, together, still each other Person (in my case for Damn near 18 years, together since I was 18) and then one day have your SOUL ripped out of your body and  watch as it's ground to dust and blows away in the gut punch of the one breath it takes to utter the words that YOUR husband has had a baby with ANOTHER WOMAN... There is NOTHING that can prepare you for something like that. \n\nYou DON'T ever \"get over\" something like that. Yes, with time, prayer, resolve, and the right mental health support one can move forward from it and live a healthy happy life BUT, it's ALWAYS in the recesses of your mind & spirit. \nWe're not talking about a broken toy that she can just cry over, have a sucker and everything is right as rain afterwards - it takes time, as much time as SIL needs. Depending on how old SIL & brother's children are they ALSO may need time to adjust to this new dynamic/reality.\n\n\nThis is an EXTREMELY delicate situation and there's NO \"simple\", straightforward, or cut & dry solutions. \n\nAlso as another commenter pointed out, everyone is throwing up the \"she's going to feel excluded\" flag,\nFirst, HOW can she feel excluded from that which she doesn't know? \n\nSecond, WHO is going to tell her she's being excluded if she's not around to know/see/feel \"excluded\"?? \n\nFurthermore though, it doesn't seem as though there might be am issue with the niece being a part of (some) family gatherings, it's her mother - brother's GF that's not invited. I also get a strong sense that the GF has been trying to insinuate into the family fold for a loOong while now. \n \n\n>so I have to stop excluding them, especially since she isn't going anywhere and her daughter is our family too\n\n>his girlfriend is angry that her and her daughter have been continuously excluded for the last 3 years. \n\n\nAs, I pointed out earlier, OP doesn't \"have\" to do a D*mn thing. I have a very strong suspicion that the GF is far more concerned with HERSELF being excluded. I have no doubt that, in her mind- whether OP's brother led her to believe it or she just THAT delusional, she expected that as soon the family found out she was pregnant that they would unceremoniously toss SIL & her kids in the trash and welcome GF into the family.\n\n\nSince that didn't happen, she's now trying to manipulate and guilt her way into family by way of her daughter as an \"All or Nothing\" package. Because who gives 2 D*mns, if \"she's not going anywhere\" or that she's angry that SHE'S been \"continuously excluded\"?!\n\n\nYes, her DAUGHTER is, their family NOT her... And her daughter has TWO parents SoOo, there's NO reason why her daughter has to be \" excluded \" other than, 1. SHE insists that she just HAS to go along when/if her daughter visits with the family or, 2. OP's Brother, her daughter FATHER, is making NO effort to make it happen! \n\nWhich leads me to back to the other major point, the girlfriend (and many commenters) are blaming OP & her family for the \"exclusion\" and berating them BUT, who she SHOULD be taking this up with is HER BABY DADDY! That's HIS family and if she was REALLY simply concerned about her daughter being able to spend time and bond with her father's side of the family then GF SHOULD be discussing it with HIM. \nThen, if it's still not happening, she's should be berating HIM and accusing HIM of excluding and alienating their daughter from his side of the family! \n\nThat is STRICTLY between THEM, the child's PARENT'S - THEN the brother can make whatever arrangements need to be made with HIS family for his daughter to spend time with them. \n\nSorry for the rant OP, I just really felt that the negative comments towards you were absolutely unfair to you. It seems that you care, if not, I doubt you would made the post in the first place. Also, I recognized and very much respect that you never spoke negatively off your brother, his girlfriend or, their situation. I'm sure you have your opinions on that but, you stayed focused on what's really just important right now- doing right by your SIL & Nibling's but, at the same time, getting outside perspective on how you're handling the situation as a whole. \nI don't believe you have any issue with your niece, she's just a child after all and none of this is her fault, but you also recognize that this is a very tricky and delicate situation for all involved. \n\nStay Well OP. Your SIL is very blessed to have your support and Love. \ud83d\udc9c", "Soft YTA, depending on the answers to: why is it up to you who to invite?\n\nIf I am hosting something in my home, I get to decide who is invited.

Yes, adults have big feelings, too, AND they have the experience and brain development to understand a situation from all angles. A child doesn\u2019t.

Frankly, I don\u2019t know why she would want him back, but its up to her. But it seems like everyone wants them back together so that they can forget the affair. So the dad who behaved horribly is forgiven, and an innocent little girl gets rejected. Due to the nature of early brain development, children are wired to interpret that rejection as personal, that there is something wrong with them. Do some research on how much being an affair child hurts. The adults have the power to minimize that hurt, and foster relationships between the child and her half siblings. The children have no power. So all of the adults need to put on their big person panties and start figuring out the best way forward for ALL of the children. No judgment to the SIL if she feels like she can\u2019t deal with the child, but if she can\u2019t deal with her then she needs to not take him back.

You do not get to break up a marriage then complain you're not treated like family.  \nShe sure had a lot of chutzpah to insist on being treated as family when she actually destroyed your SIL's family herself. \n\nVery much NTA.", "Why is your brother still invited when he did the cheating, the knocking up and the whole having a child with someone who isn\u2019t his wife thing?\nDouble standards much?\n\nAnd that child is family, whether you like it or not. She has done nothing wrong.", "NTA. The GF and love child aren\u2019t owed anything.  If I was in that position, I\u2019d be mortified and sure as shit not acting entitled.", "Mistress is right though- she IS NOT going anywhere.... Like on vacation", "\u201eshe\u2018s finally stopped wanting a divorce\u201c \nAnd this is ok for you. She should divorce him for what he did!!! Do you think as long as you take her to the vacations she will stay???? Please don\u2018t That would be disgusting", "NTA. Glad you stood by the right side and by that kept your brothers children in your lives and let them feel loved.\nThe mistress should've known better..\ud83d\ude0f", "Sil does not have to accept shit", "Dude, you've said that he's still with the girlfriend as well...\n\nJust because she's willing to communicate with him, doesn't mean she's gonna take him back, and she bloody well shouldn't if he's still cheating on her.", "Or most likely she is mentally moving on, trying to find peace and trying to create the base of a better co-parenting relationship with him for their kids before the divorce. It's been over 3 years of separation. And on top of it he is still with the mistress, he is far from remorseful. SIL can do a lot better than your brother.\n\nNot wanting to keep the hate for someone doesn't necessarily mean forgivness, it can mean she is loosing every feeling for him, not just the good ones but the bad ones too, she is putting this relationship in the past and after a while she will have no feelings for him at all. The opposite of love is indifference, apathy and not hate.\n\nTo me it's mind blowing that your brother is invited to the vacation.... I wouldn't have invited him. Do you invite him on vacations with his seperated wife in hopes that they will get back together, so you can play matchmaker? I hope not. SIL should leave him for good, move on with her life.", "Your brother needs to pick whether he wants his cake or to eat it too. He can't both be married to your sister-in-law and causing her pain and be seeing his girlfriend still. It puts the entire family in limbo and you don't have to engage", "I feel bad for the kid.  That is his child and it sounds like everyone is acting like you all trying to pretend it didn\u2019t happen.  As the mother of the kid I would be pissed too that her daughter isn\u2019t invited if she is trying to have a father in her child\u2019s life.  It doesn\u2019t sound like he is being much of one.  If he isn\u2019t wanting anything to do with child, then he needs to stop in general seeing kid.  If he wants to be a father to child then the family, including wife, will have to accept he made a mistake and he has a child now.", "I feel bad for the little girl because she is innocent in all of this, but the only one responsible for fixing it is her AH of a father. He literally brought her into this situation. And instead of putting in ANY effort, he's going with the lazy way out of \"well why can't we all just get along, I can have my wife and family over here, and continue with my mistress and daughter there.\" I feel bad for the kid, and this will likely cause trauma for her, but it also isn't fair to punish everyone else (and likely cause trauma to the wife and kids) The only one who can and should be doing anything about this is the brother, and honestly, he should be the one shunned by family until he does.\n\nEdited to remove a bad word for which mods deleted my comment.", "OP's brother is still together with his mistress.", "It's not the families fault the brother needs to figure his shit out. The daughter could come but cheating homewrecker needs to stay home. The brother probably doesn't even advocate for his side family. That's on him. I wouldn't want my vacation filled with drama and bickering from that shit.", "Op said the brother was invited. So the only one being punished is the little girl.", "Adding on here. Does o even have a relationship to gf where she could invite her? What if all of this is word of mouth from her brother? If so she couldn't/wouldn't invite a basic stranger to family vacation", "Are you actually suggesting though that they hide her existence from the kids? They would need to handle it in an age appropriate way but the dad has obligations to her - child support etc. She is going to be around. Hiding her existence so they don't have to deal with the reality of their dad cheating is never going to end well. I've already said I'm not sure at 3 she realises she is being excluded now, but at some point she will.", "Forget the adults. If any of the kids are old enough to understand, she will be shunned by all the kids.", "Brother could always bring the kid too. It's his daughter as well. But I'll tell you this: mistress says them and us meaning her too. She reminds me of my mother and it's gonna mess that kid up", "What would you do if your husband bring home another child?", "Oohoh, see... that one right there is one to watch out for.... trickery at it's finest! \n\nI miss babies, but do NOT miss toddlers. LOL", "Because a vacation with a 3 year old you have to do 100% of the care is not a vacation. It\u2019s parenting in another place, without the comfortability of home. Brother would try to get wife\u2019s help and OP doesn\u2019t want to put wife in that position.\n\nIt\u2019s not the kid\u2019s fault they\u2019re an affair baby. But until they\u2019re more self sufficient, it\u2019s ok for wife to not want them on vacation. If wife stays with brother and forgives him, she is going to be around this kid for life, so future vacations the kid might come. The affair partner? Hell no.", "Replied to another similar comment...\n\nI just can't understand the whole idea of a \"homewrecker\" I guess. She's not the one who promised to be with the wife in sickness and health. In fact at the very beginning she may've been completely clueless. And I very much doubt she chained the poor dude to the bed so he can't go back to his wife and other kids.\n\nDid she drag it for too long? Oh yes, totally. Did it benefit her? Well, in my book it didn't, she would've been better off moving on, getting childcare payments and finding a decent guy - but you may have a different option here. Why did she drag it? Is it because her heart is black and full of asholery? Is she keeping him with her against his will? Is she guilty of not disappearing forever into the horizon with her child and leaving everyone alone?", "The girlfriend played a part if she knew he was married", "Exactly. When I started dating my husband and found out he was just separated and not divorced, I told him to call me when he was single, I don't date married men. 6 months later, after the divorce was final, we got back together. It's not that hard to not be a jerk.", "\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23", "If I were a guy, I wouldn't. I'd get confused with the names lol", "He's definitely much worse than she is, but he is part of the family meanwhile she's a random woman none of them want in their life. And he didn't marry her afterwards AND he and his wife are maybe fixing things. \n\npersonally, I'd still have a problem with a cheater, and I think it's weird when people are bale to move past something like this but that's me. \n\nAlso, if his own wife still wants him (for some reason) there's not much the others can do.\n\nAnd there IS a huge level of entitlement going on if you have a baby with a man you know is in a marriage and expect to be treated as family. He's the bigger AH because he's the one who wasn't faithful, but she's still an AH too. \n\nOP and the rest of the family have no obligation to her. Anything the kid goes through is her parents' fault for making terrible decisions. It seriously sucks, but it's not fair to ask a woman who remained faithful to the family to repeatedly have to see the woman her husband cheated on her with. Nor would it be fair to exclude her (having the others around will surely make her feel unwelcome or she won't want to go anymore, which isn't fair, because she did everything right. She didn't cheat. She was good to the rest of the family. She's been part of the family for years and years) for the gf and gf's kid. \n\nNTA OP", "consonants only", "You sound like you\u2019re REALLY invested in affecting the outcome of this.

Bro will continue to be part of the family.  What are they supposed to do?  Ostracize him on vacation so everyone can be miserable?   My guess is that since the wife has decided to get over it and move on, the rest have gone along with her decision.\n\nMy late BIL fooled around on my sis - I could barely stand to look at the sleazy MF, but there he was at all the cookouts and all the holidays.  I could glare daggers at him the whole time, or I could enjoy the rest of my family and ignore the jackass.", "Y'all please stop making excuses for the side piece.  She knew what she was doing.
