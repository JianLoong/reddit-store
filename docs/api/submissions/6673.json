How many posts on here are from \"unfavoured\" children talking about their extended families or parents treating a sibling more favourably? We always support those guys. Yet here people are not supporting the 3 year old girl. \n\nThis is not her fault. She's still your family. You don't need to invite the girlfriend - her FATHER and GRANDPARENTS are there for the 3 year old...\n\nBut, you know... You guys don't seem to want a relationship with your own blood.", "NTA.", "All the E S H and saying OP is T A is really blowing my mind! \n\nOP is absolutely NTA! First off OP is a grown woman and chose to invite/include or NOT to invite/include whoever she pleases... That's the beauty of being an adult with freewill.\n\nIt is clear OP is not making her decisions out of malice, quite the opposite actually, she's being considerate and sensitive to her SIL's & Nibling's feelings and to the gravity of the waking nightmare that they're perpetually trapped in.\n\nThose saying that the niece shouldn't be \"punished\" and \"excluded\" because of what her parents did are absolutely, unequivocally correct!\n\nWhat everyone saying this should take a moment to step back & recognize is that OP & her parents are NOT \"punishing\" NOR \"excluding\" her.\n\nBut, it seems that everyone is in such a hurry to eviscerate OP that they're missing the MOST important and OBVIOUS point here...  That. Is. NOT. OP's. NOR. Her. Parents. Responsibility.\n\nMaybe I missed it but, I don't recall seeing any comments recognizing that this Little One is NOT OP's child! \n\nShe is OP's BROTHER'S child. She is HIS responsibility. It is HIS responsibility the make sure that she is included in HIS family's gatherings. It is HIS responsibility to encourage and foster relationships between HIS child and the rest of HIS family.\n\nBut to double back to why I felt I HAD to comment; \n\nFirst the commenters telling OP she should be inviting the niece, and \"SIL needs to suck it up & get over it\",\nOBVIOUSLY have NEVER been married; going through the ups & downs, the good & the bad, the smooth & the rough yet always coming out on the other end- not perfect but, together, still each other Person (in my case for Damn near 18 years, together since I was 18) and then one day have your SOUL ripped out of your body and  watch as it's ground to dust and blows away in the gut punch of the one breath it takes to utter the words that YOUR husband has had a baby with ANOTHER WOMAN... There is NOTHING that can prepare you for something like that. \n\nYou DON'T ever \"get over\" something like that. Yes, with time, prayer, resolve, and the right mental health support one can move forward from it and live a healthy happy life BUT, it's ALWAYS in the recesses of your mind & spirit. \nWe're not talking about a broken toy that she can just cry over, have a sucker and everything is right as rain afterwards - it takes time, as much time as SIL needs. Depending on how old SIL & brother's children are they ALSO may need time to adjust to this new dynamic/reality.\n\n\nThis is an EXTREMELY delicate situation and there's NO \"simple\", straightforward, or cut & dry solutions. \n\nAlso as another commenter pointed out, everyone is throwing up the \"she's going to feel excluded\" flag,\nFirst, HOW can she feel excluded from that which she doesn't know? \n\nSecond, WHO is going to tell her she's being excluded if she's not around to know/see/feel \"excluded\"?? \n\nFurthermore though, it doesn't seem as though there might be am issue with the niece being a part of (some) family gatherings, it's her mother - brother's GF that's not invited. I also get a strong sense that the GF has been trying to insinuate into the family fold for a loOong while now. \n \n\n>so I have to stop excluding them, especially since she isn't going anywhere and her daughter is our family too\n\n>his girlfriend is angry that her and her daughter have been continuously excluded for the last 3 years. \n\n\nAs, I pointed out earlier, OP doesn't \"have\" to do a D*mn thing. I have a very strong suspicion that the GF is far more concerned with HERSELF being excluded. I have no doubt that, in her mind- whether OP's brother led her to believe it or she just THAT delusional, she expected that as soon the family found out she was pregnant that they would unceremoniously toss SIL & her kids in the trash and welcome GF into the family.\n\n\nSince that didn't happen, she's now trying to manipulate and guilt her way into family by way of her daughter as an \"All or Nothing\" package. Because who gives 2 D*mns, if \"she's not going anywhere\" or that she's angry that SHE'S been \"continuously excluded\"?!\n\n\nYes, her DAUGHTER is, their family NOT her... And her daughter has TWO parents SoOo, there's NO reason why her daughter has to be \" excluded \" other than, 1. SHE insists that she just HAS to go along when/if her daughter visits with the family or, 2. OP's Brother, her daughter FATHER, is making NO effort to make it happen! \n\nWhich leads me to back to the other major point, the girlfriend (and many commenters) are blaming OP & her family for the \"exclusion\" and berating them BUT, who she SHOULD be taking this up with is HER BABY DADDY! That's HIS family and if she was REALLY simply concerned about her daughter being able to spend time and bond with her father's side of the family then GF SHOULD be discussing it with HIM. \nThen, if it's still not happening, she's should be berating HIM and accusing HIM of excluding and alienating their daughter from his side of the family! \n\nThat is STRICTLY between THEM, the child's PARENT'S - THEN the brother can make whatever arrangements need to be made with HIS family for his daughter to spend time with them. \n\nSorry for the rant OP, I just really felt that the negative comments towards you were absolutely unfair to you. It seems that you care, if not, I doubt you would made the post in the first place. Also, I recognized and very much respect that you never spoke negatively off your brother, his girlfriend or, their situation. I'm sure you have your opinions on that but, you stayed focused on what's really just important right now- doing right by your SIL & Nibling's but, at the same time, getting outside perspective on how you're handling the situation as a whole. \nI don't believe you have any issue with your niece, she's just a child after all and none of this is her fault, but you also recognize that this is a very tricky and delicate situation for all involved. \n\nStay Well OP. Your SIL is very blessed to have your support and Love. \ud83d\udc9c", "Soft YTA, depending on the answers to: why is it up to you who to invite?\n\nIf I am hosting something in my home, I get to decide who is invited.

Even if it\u2019s 10 years from now, but I agree in that no way could it happen now.  It\u2019s totally up to the OP about that but something to consider again in the future. If it\u2019s 10 years from now and the family hates the child, then of course it wouldn\u2019t be okay to expose the child to the hatred. At the end of the day it\u2019s her family though and she will do what she wants to do regardless of an internet stranger. \n\nAlso I said she\u2019s NTA.", "Brother was kicked out of SIL and his home. We can assume, that he does not live there currently. SIL wants a divorce but brother does not but is still dating mistress.", "> the brother is the one who doesn\u2019t want to divorce her and \u201cwork things out.\u201d \n\nBut he says \"it seems like she\u2019s finally stopped wanting a divorce and being angry with my brother.\" What does that even mean???", "I agree on not punishing the kid. Invite her to go with her father on the family vacation. If her mother says no, well... The option was given to avoid burdening the child.", "My friend you asking all the right questions", "I honestly don\u2019t understand why this hasn\u2019t already been made clear or being answered. \nIs the brother expecting to have some kind of poly relationship going on?\nIs he just still with the gf but going to break up with her if the wife takes him back?", "Poor guy can't think about law stuff unless he's getting laid regularly.", "He wants his wife but not willing to brake up with gf unless he has confirmation that wife will take him back. Bet anything.", "It's a tough situation, especially with the marriage still in limbo. I feel bad for the child but there is no perfect solution and you're right to prioritize your SIL and her children at this time. It would be wrong to invite them given your SIL's presence and your parents' refusal to engage. \n\nIt's inappropriate for the mistress to put pressure on you. Decisions need to be made about how things will work but they'll take time and I'd expect your brother to be the one to work things out with your family, not his mistress. Your parents may never embrace the child, which is sad for her but an understandable reaction to the affair and the pain it caused. \n\nDon't let yourself be put in the middle if you can help it. Your brother, SIL, and the mistress have issues to resolve that are way out of your control. Until they figure out what they're doing it'll be a mess. Try not to let their mess become your mess. Keep doing what you're doing, supporting and loving your SIL. If you want to build a relationship with the child then feel free to try but that doesn't mean you have to embrace her mother as part of your family no matter how hard the mistress pushes for it. Because she's not family. Maybe down the road things will change, your brother will marry the mistress and folks will have to reevaluate how she fits into the family, but that's not the situation right now.\n\nI wish you luck.", "You have to remember that the child is innocent in all of this. The biggest AH is your brother for cheating. Second biggest probably goes to the gf. We don\u2019t know how big of an AH she is though\u2026 she\u2019s an AH for knowingly staying with your brother, but did she know he was married when they first got together?", "Why not invite the child? She is half sibling to your other niblings. Then it is her mother's choice to allow her to attend or not.", "The grandparents at least should make an effort for their granddaughter and the attitude of the OP towards their innocent niece stinks. They have no obligation towards the mistress.\n\nThe AH in this situation are the adults. The brother for creating this mess, the mistress for demanding a holiday she's not entitled to and the OP for their remark above which shows they're projecting their disdain for the situation on the child also.\n\nThe grown up thing to start creating some goodness out of this cluster fuck is for the grandparents and OP to try and have a relationship with that innocent child away from the mistress. Even if she's against it now there is nothing wrong with trying.", "If it's so hard for the wife to see him with his child, she might want to divorce him because his daughter is going to be around her siblings", "That she\u2019s just probably stopped fighting for the divorce and is just accepting it.", "Like maybe they don't need to hide the steak knives anymore??", "Especially because he still HAS A GF?!?", "Maybe he wants a sister wife \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23", "Ahhahaah facts lol", "And mistress is too!!! The kid is innocent and that poor kid growing up knowing she was not wanted by her dad that she was the product of an affair. Ugh why do people cause such crap", "Please answer the question. Where, specifically, does OP blame the affair kid for being born?", "I\u2019ve heard of a single instance like this. Dude has a wife and kid, picks up a side piece. Dates her for 3 YEARS, has a kid and THEN mistress finds out he\u2019s been married the whole time. That was FIVE YEARS AGO and they\u2019re about to have their SECOND CHILD \ud83e\udd74\ud83d\ude02 legally he\u2019s still married to his wife, she reaps the benefits of being married I assume (taxes, health insurance, a home etc) with absolutely 0 hassle of actually having a husband???? And mistress plays house with him. \ud83e\udd2f", "So she\u2019s going to stay married to him but allow him to have a girlfriend? That\u2019s weird. Her problem is with the husband, he should be setting the boundaries for the girlfriend.", "Since it seems like the brother lives with the girlfriend, she\u2019s not allowing it, she\u2019s just not pushing for the divorce", "You can't just get divorced whenever you want to. When you get legally married you let the government into your relationship and they get final say on whether you are allowed to divorce or not. Oftentimes you have to go through separation for 2+ years first, you also need both parties to agree (I think it's possible to do without the other parties consent but it requires taking them to court so you can try to convince a judge they should allow it). It can screw with your financial situation too if one person is making more then the other person, even if the other person is purposefully being a deadbeat (I know a couple women who married men who turned into useless deadbeats who did nothing but play video games and spend their money on food delivery and they can't divorce them unless they are willing to pay alimony and continue to support the lazy deadbeat who refuses to get a job). It's a lot more complicated then just dumping your bf/gf in a lot of places.", "dependin where ur at usually its a yr"]}
