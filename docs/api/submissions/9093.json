The thought of her sleeping on that was honestly adorable and the sellers had posted it for quite cheap so I messaged them straight away. We organised a meeting time and I arrived there with my brother to help me carry the bed out. \n\nI was talking to the lady selling it and she asked who the bed was for, if it was for my own kid or a sister or whatever. She was just making friendly conversation so I kinda laughed and said it was actually gonna be for my dog. She went quiet for a bit before she began lecturing me on how buying the bed for my dog was selfish and that I\u2019m taking away the opportunity for a little girl to actually get this bed. She explained that not all families can afford to give their child a nice bed like this which is why she put it so cheap.\n\nI was kinda in shock so i didn\u2019t really say anything but she just kept drilling into me about it before she told me to leave and that she wasn\u2019t going to sell me the bed anymore.

If this woman actually wanted to help low income families she'd give the bed away. Her argument is grossly performative.", "NTA if she had a specific target buyer, she should have said so. She messed up.", "NTA - and if Mrs High and Mighty were so concerned about people who can't afford a bed like that she could have donated it or given it as a gift. She was rude and sanctimonious and she has no business lecturing anyone else on any subject when she hasn't even mastered basic manners.\n\nForget her, she's a nasty piece of work who is simply not worth you getting upset over.", "This is hilarious.

And if you're selling something, it's none of your business what people do with it once it's sold.\n\nShe should have specified, or asked when you responded to her ad, if she was so dead set on it going to a specific use. The lecture she gave you was totally unnecessary - she could've just said \"Sorry I'd prefer to sell it to someone who's going to use it for a child\". At least she gave you the money back.", "NTA.\n\nThe lady is in the right not to sell you considering the circumstances, since it seems she had a specific audience in mind. If that was important to her, she should have inquired you before meeting in person or perhaps disclose that info in the advert. Chastising you because of your intent to use the bed for your dog is totally uncalled for. While I do understand her reasoning, I don't support her meddling, and imo she was TA for that.\n\nYou are NTA because you are entitled to do what you want with your money. I love my dog, and only my wife and I know how much we've spent buying things to make him more comfortable and happy. Hope you find a nice bed for your princess doggo!", "NTA.\n\nIf she cares so much about little kids getting nice beds, she could have donated it for free to a charity.\n\nIf she's selling it for cash, it's no business of hers what you intend to do with it.", "NTA, my dog has his own room with a queen sized sled bed.

Granted, I doubt she expected someone buying it for a dog, but if she had her heart selling it to a kid who needed a nice bed that should have been specified. Like \"I don't need this bed and would love to see it go to a child who would love it.\" \n\nShe also should have been more kind in her response and politely declined to sell it to you with the valid explanation.", "Nta there was no specifications on the the listing", "NTA. It\u2019s your money and your dog, you can do with it as you please. She just sounds rude.", "NAh. \n\nYou're not the AH for wanting to buy it, she's not the AH for wanting to sell it to a family. But maybe the way the seller went about telling you could have been nicer.", "NTA, your doggie deserves to feel like a princess too imo", ">I sort of think that if that was her intent with the bed she could have stated that in the description\n\nIt probably never occurred to her that someone would buy it for an animal and not a little girl\n\nI don't think she's an asshole because she was trying to be nice\n\nI'm going with NAH.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
