{"id": 11648, "submission_id": "11k59wp", "title": "AITA for making my uncle \"homeless\"?", "selftext": "5 years ago (when I was 19) I moved into my great-uncles 2-bedroom apartment. He was in a car accident as a teenager and has been in a wheelchair since. The apartment is on the first floor and completely accessible to him. I pay for half the rent and over half the utilities. He has some other health issues, and I took responsibility for his care when I moved in.\n\nMy girlfriend and I have been together for 4 years and she still lives with her parent. We have been planning to move in together for 6 months and my uncle has known this. My girlfriend won't move in with me as she doesn\u2019t like my uncle (awful social skills). 5 weeks ago, we found a new apartment (in a different town) to move to and are moving in a few days. My uncle has been angry with me since the moment I first brought up moving but became furious when I actually followed through. He has had 5 weeks to both find someone to move in to pay my share of the rent/utilities plus take on the chores/care work I did for him. However, no one we know wants to move in with him or knows someone who does. I also tried various sites posting about a vacancy but still nobody has been interested. In all honesty no stranger is going to put up with living with my uncle as he is a bit of a nightmare.\n\nThe apartment is in really bad shape and the landlord is useless. Plus, despite my best efforts I think my uncle prefers living in a condition close to squalor. If my uncle hasn't found anyone to move in by next month, he is not going to be able to pay for the rent or utilities. He's tried finding other places to live but none are both affordable and accessible. Also, he can't really live alone without finding someone to help care for him. The town we currently live in is around 3 hours away from where the rest of our family live, so it isn't that convenient for them to come and help him. I will also be too far away to frequently be able to travel back.\n\nBecause of all these issues my uncle is most likely to have to move out and stay with one of his brothers. This uncle also lives in really bad conditions in a trailer park in our hometown and it's only a 1 bedroom. However, the trailer is wheelchair accessible as he built a ramp, and it has a wide door entry. His brother will also be able to provide some care for him.\n\nMy uncle is mad at me and is blaming me for essentially making him homeless and ruining his life. He is very upset as he's lived in the same apartment for over 30 years and really doesn't want to move. Other family members have also blamed me for causing issues with my uncle and say I'm being selfish for moving and not giving him enough time to sort out other arrangements. I told my uncle and the rest of my family about my plans to move 6 months ago and suggested someone start helping my uncle to figure out living arrangements. I didn't realise when I moved in with him at 19 that he would essentially become my burden forever which is what some in my family are trying to insinuate.

You can\u2019t live your life as your uncle\u2019s live-in servant.", "NTA - You communicated your intent quite clearly and with adequate time. You should not be shackled to anyone permanently. He should not be your burden.", "NTA. \n\nHe should have been planning this for months. Even though he shouldn't be your burden, you did provide care and he relied on you, so hopefully you were reminding him periodically before officially finding a place as well. \n\nNo one should expect you to stay there forever just because uncle can't afford to live their alone, or needs some one to provide some care for him.  \n\nIs there no public housing available for him? Does he qualify for home health aids/care giver? I'm sure there may be waiting lists for housing and health aids are low on staff, but he sounds like the perfect candidate. He has to accept that he can't stay at his place, and if it wasn't for you moving in at 19 he'd have been out of there long ago... You helped him for a long time but that doesn't mean his problems are your responsibility to solve and handle.", "NTA, but how did your uncle pay for his rent before you moved in( he's been there 30 years). Also, doesn't he get some type of assistance for his bills.", "NTA. You gave him a good amount of time, and I\u2019m sure you will do what you can to help him around the apartment once in awhile until he gets acclimated. Have him look into ERAP and other housing assistance. He has a disability so it will help him qualify. \n\nHim and your family have to understand you need to move on with your life.", "NTA. You\u2019re not your uncles carer. I probably would have waited until I found a replacement though but it\u2019s not at all necessary, and you can\u2019t wait around forever either.", "Have you contacted social services on his behalf? There may be in-home health care aides that can help. Yes, he still needs to find a new living situation, but the assistance shouldn't fall on his roommate. That's just too much to ask of anyone \u2014 stranger or family.", "NTA contact a social worker in your area. They might be able to help him source some finances to stay in his apartment and set up home care; they can also assist straighten up his home situation. They might also come in and determine that he needs a higher standard of care. Perhaps he needs to be in assisted living. 6 months is plenty of notice and it\u2019s unreasonable for anyone to expect a young person to dedicate years to the sole care of another.", "NTA You're an adult trying to live your life, not a caretaker. You didn't agree to be one I'm assuming and I'm guessing no else is helping him is partly due to bad attitude from him. Maybe he should look for a care facility that's right for him.", "NTA. You gave him adequate notice to find a new roommate or relocate. You've provided free care fir 5 yesrs. Contact your other uncle (the obe with the trailer) about contacting social services to see what resources are available for him.", "NTA You don't belong to him! Your life doesn't belong to him! You deserve to be able to find a partner and live your own life!", "NTA- just know the family members are mad now because they have to deal with him, where as before they could just dump it all on you.  You told him 6 months ago, and then he finally got a clue 5 weeks ago that it was really happening.  I'm pretty sure family thought they could guilt you into staying with him forever.   He isnt your responsibility, he does have a place to go and other family that could also try to help him.", "NTA\n\nFirst, let\u2019s just acknowledge one thing here - Father Time is undefeated, and independent living cant always happen forever. 30 years in one apartment and lifestyle is tough to give up, so his frustration at the prospect of impending change is understandable.\n\nI\u2019m sorry he hasn\u2019t been able to find a solution. That stinks, and I\u2019m sure everyone, including you, feel bad about that. But he requires a level of care that doesn\u2019t mesh well with independent living, so he either needs to look into assisted care, or to other family. You gave a lot of notice, and did what you could to help find solutions.\n\nYou shouldn\u2019t be expected to put your life on hold. Not fair to you at all.", "NTA and the nerve of your other family members \ud83e\udd28 they needa step up and help instead of running their mouthes. You\u2019re 19 for Christ\u2019s sake.", "NTA but indeed 5 weeks for someone with special needs is a very short time. That said time to get orge family member invested and find a solution. Moving uncle in a smaller place where maintaining and affording the house is more doable for him, contacting association that can help him out, see if between family n friends a rotating system can work out to see if he need anything.\nIt\u2019s very hard on families with members with special needs and I don\u2019t think anybody will find you at fault for stepping down and starting rightfully your own life.", "NTA. You have your life to live. He had plenty of time to find alternative arrangements and he has options. Anyone talking s*** can volunteer to take him in and care for him.", "NTA. You provided 5 years of being his roommate and helping take care of him.\n\nThis falls in the 'no good deed goes unpunished' category.\n\nYou're an adult and deserve to live your own life.\n\nThe family criticizing you can either move in with him, provide funds to cover the rent during the transition, or find other resources.\n\nYou have more than done your part. Move on.", "NTA you are not your uncle's carer or keeper and you DID give him plenty of time to sort his care and housing out!  \n\n\nGo live your life with your partner. Uncle is big enough to figure his own life out.", "NTA. So, you're selfish for wanting to have your own life? For wanting the normalcy of a relationship and a place of your own?\n\nSheesh.", "NTA, though maybe should have given more time to figure out his living situation first.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Your family is pissed because now someone will have to deal with him & it won't be you; you kind of became their sacrificial lamb when you moved in with him & took over his care. He had 6 months to make other arrangements but he's absolved because *he didn't take you seriously*? That's some bull right there.", "He's had several other roommates over the years before me. However, the rent and utilities were not as expensive previously so he could afford both when he had gaps between roommates. All his money comes from financial assistants but it is not that much.", "Half a year is a pretty long time tbh, any longer he would've had a years notice.", "Isn\u2019t six months enough?", "Ok. Well your Uncle needs a look to see if there's any programs available to him like rental assistance and the such.", "This isn't just a roommate, the uncle has a host of medical issues, which means he can't live alone and needs special accommodations.

That takes longer to find.", "I imagine so but 6 months is still a long time and it sounds like it wasn't utilized by the uncle at all. Do you really think more than 6 months wouldve had a different outcome? And do you think OPs girlfriend wants to wait 8, 10, months or even a year to move? What about OP? Like I understand the uncle has a life to live but so does OP.", "It really sounds like the uncle refused to find assistance and was planning on guilting OP into staying there. He gave him plenty of time; the uncle just ignored the problem so he could tell OP that he didn't give him enough time later.", "6 months would have been PLENTY of time to find different accommodations IF he had taken OP seriously from the beginning and began his search then. Sounds like he waited until he only had 5 weeks until the move out date and that is unfortunate but entirely his own problem. He should have never disregarded the first warning 6 months ago and taken responsibility for himself. NTA"]}
