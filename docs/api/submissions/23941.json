Now I have severe diagnosed social anxiety and I'm even on medication for it, I also have depression which causes me to not clean my room for 1-3 weeks because of the lack of motivation I have. My mom said that it was fine and that we'd just keep the door closed and the guests wouldnt need to come into my room anyway. Fast forwards to when the guests arrive, my mom knocks on my door, doesnt wait for an answer and just barges in with the guests' young son. Obviously I'm feeling extremely nervous and embarrassed now, because the young son and my mom kept saying how dirty it was in my room, and how there are so many plastic water bottles everywhere, the child even said that things about radioactivity should be taught here. Then they left the room. I felt like crying but I didn't, I just picked at my fingers like I usually do when I'm nervous. I know it's not the child's fault, which is why I didn't do anything to him. Fast forward a few hours later, my mom, my dad, and the guests were at a restaurant and they just came back to my\nhouse. A few minutes later, my mom knocks on my door again, doesnt wait for an answer and barges in with the young boy and they start counting the bottles in my room, and when they finish my mom said \"I was right it was between 15 and 20\" I'm feeling extremely agitated and humiliated at this point, so as my mom is leaving the room, she looks back and I flip her off. When they left my room completely I started crying and picking at my skin and I started having thoughts about harming myself. Fast forward to today, it's been a few days since the incident and me and my mother havent said a word to eachother. But I felt angry that she didnt even apologize to me because I feel like I deserved an apology for being humiliated infront of the guests. So when my dad left to go shopping, I went to the pantry while my mom was in the living room, and I very loudly said \"Wow I wonder how many bottles of alchohol are in here\" And I started counting, when I was done, I said \"Wow I was right, it was over 30\" which it was, and then I left to go back to my room. and I texted her 'Too many to count'. My mom doesn't really have a drinking problem but she gets drunk frequently and makes everyone uncomfortable. I dont think she's even trying to stop. But now I think I'm the AH because I couldve just cleaned my room when my mom said the guests were coming, but I didnt because she said nobody is going to come into my room.

She told you no one would go in your room so it\u2019s ok that it was dirty. She knows and bout your social anxiety. \n\nShe then brought people to your room SHE OPENED THE DOOR for them and allowed the child to make mean comments knowing that they would hurt you. Than after dinner she repeated it. \n\nOp do you see that she purposely tried to hurt you? \n\nYou gave her the middle finger and she SAID NOTHING. No yelling at you. No stern talk. Nothing. In my opinion that was the reaction she was looking for, so why would she go off in you? \n\nIm so sorry you have to deal with this. You are a magnificent human who is destined for beauty beyond belief. You are in control of your life just remember you can choose better and be whatever you want. It does not matter who birthed you. I know it\u2019s a cliche but thinking positive will help, fake it til you make it I believe is what it\u2019s called. You\u2019re resilient.", "Eh, this wasn't mature, but you're 16 your mom was far, far worse here. She lied, she set her mentally unwell teenager up to fail and struggle even more (really quite despicable of her), and it does indeed sound like she has a drinking problem to boot. \n\nSo I'm voting NTA because your mom was so bad here, not because I'm pro-flipping off parents. Extreme circumstances. I hope you have trusted adults to whom you can reach out about your thoughts of self-harm. Please do so right away.", "NTA because you are so young and have issues.\n\nIf your mother is getting drunk frequently (and makes others feel uncomfortable) I would say she has an alcohol problem! But that is not your issue to fix.\n\nAre you in therapy? Medication alone isn't going to solve your anxiety and depression. You need to find healthy ways of coping with your feelings and although drugs may help cope with the worst, you need to find ways to deal without drugs. If your current provider only wants to give drugs and not therapy, find someone else.\n\nI think that what your mum did was shitty, there was no need for her to show guests your room or humiliate you like that. But I do know from personal experience that it helps mental health if your private space is clean and fairly tidy/not too chaotic. Could you try a new habit of spending 10 minutes every day tidying/cleaning up your room? Do a deep clean now, if you feel comfortable, ask your father/mother with this so that you will be held accountable to do it and it will be motivating to have someone help. If your room is then at a clean and tidy baseline, then you can implement the '10 minute tidy' every day. Do that at a set point in your day, maybe an hour before you plan to go to sleep?\n\nDo you have a large-enough garbage bin in your own room so that it takes almost no effort to throw away garbage? Do you have a large-enough wardrobe cupboard for all your clothes? Do you have enough storage space for all your stuff? If there are any issues there, ask help to resolve them. It's impossible to have a tidy room if you have more clothes and stuff than you have cupboard space. Maybe look for cheap storage solutions or get rid of some stuff you no longer want/need if space is an issue.\n\nI used to be really lacking in tidy up and regular cleaning and I still am but I feel so much better when I can find what I need, when I have enough clean clothes to wear because I regularly put stuff in laundry and do my laundry. Do you have your own laundry hamper in your room to throw dirty clothes in? That might help too.\n\nGood luck with everything. You can do it! You 100% have the power to improve your mood and coping mechanisms :). You got this!\n\nPS: If you are just drinking still water, maybe invest in a large, cute reusable water bottle that you refill at the tap (if your house has safe drinking water)? Better for the environment, better for your (parents') wallet :). I have a nice stainless steel one I bought second hand, but nice new reusable water bottles can be bought for probably less than US$ 10. And if you don't have the money, just reuse one of these plastic water bottles you currently have and fill with tap water :).", "ESH. Everyone else hit the nail on the head for why. But op, as someone who has adhd and anxiety, I used to struggle with not feeling motivated to clean. But, what I discovered is mess and chaos made everything so much worse. It was like a light bulb went off over my head when I finally figured it out. Even when the last thing I want to do is clean, I push myself to do it. And I feel so much better when it's done. My anxiety level goes way down, and I also have the euphoria of feeling like I accomplished something. I also found something else that helps with my anxiety. I build tiny dollhouses. The kits can be found on Amazon. And even though I cuss out the house and get frustrated with it, it requires concentration, and I don't worry about everything else while doing it. And when it's done, I feel so good about myself. Find a hobby that requires concentration. You'd be amazed on how having something to focus on lowers your stress.", "Really soft ESH (bordering on NTA)\n\nFirst, it isn't nice to flip people off in anger. We all know this.\nSecond, your mother explicitly said to not worry, and that no one was going to be in your room. But then turned around and deliberately brought a guest in TWICE so she could make fun of her own daughter and your mental health. In such an obvious and cruel manner.\nThird, counting the bottles back at her was petty. I fully understand and might have done the same thing, but we both know it's shitty because that was the point of doing it.\n\nSo I want to be very clear that although what you did wasn't nice, your mother is a) a full grown adult and b) your mother and should NOT have done what she did. It was petty and sad and cruel.\n\nFinally, because I'm seeing a few sad comments, let's remember that mental health IS health. Trouble cleaning? Been there. Depression isn't something to laugh at. Sometimes lack of executive function ties back to ADHD or a similar diagnosis. Anxiety is real. And you are valid.\n\nSlightly unrelated, but what helps me tidy (and cleaning is somewhat related to trauma involving my mother's ex: it can be hard) is to put on the HAPPIEST music I can find. My choice is often \"royalty free music\" which is usually scandipop or something. I play the same playlist every time I clean. And it helps, just a little.\n\nI don't know what will happen next, but I wish you luck. I hope you can feel loved and valid within your family.", "ESH. And it does sound like your mother has a drinking problem.\n\nI suggest you discuss everything with your therapist. Especially the thoughts about self harm and your mothers drinking.", "***ESH***\n\nI'd go on, but the reasons I would list have been accounted for in multiple responses.", "ESH but your mother is supposed to be the adult - and the parent of a girl being treated for mental health issues.  But two wrongs don't make a right, and embarrassing her isn't likely to have improved things, and it sounds like you knew that.  You owe each other apologies, but you're only responsible for yours.", "[removed]", "ESH.\n\nYou need to clean your room, but your mothers shaming tactics were also disgusting.

It makes such a HUGE difference to be able to bin garbage in your own room because it will take like 2 seconds to throw something in your own bin whereas now you have to get up from your bed/chair and go to another part of the house to bin waste. The laundry hamper might be too big for your room, so you could use a canvas tote bag that you hang up somewhere. Ask your father or mother for these things and if they don't want to pay or money is super tight, can you use your own money? If money is tight, can you talk to a trusted adult in your family, maybe an aunt/uncle or grandmother/grandfather? You can say something like: \"I am finding it hard to regularly tidy and clean my room and realised that I want to change. I think a garbage bin and laundry hamper in my room would help but mum/dad don't want to spend the money. I hate asking for money but do you think you could help me with this?\"\n\nYour bedroom should be the room in which you are most comfortable, the room you can retreat to to fully be yourself, be with yourself, to relax in, to sleep well in, to work in, to hang out with friends in. Having the room clean and tidy will help with your enjoyment of your room. And decorating the room in a way that you love will also help a lot. Maybe if the room is decorated in your style/taste, you will feel more inclined to keep it clean/tidy? Is your room in your current style or is it not at all your style or maybe dated because it was made for a younger child (when you were younger)? I remember decorating my teenage room in my style. It was great and my mum let me paint the walls a dark jade, I got black carpet, a big desk, I painted my metal bed frame in neon colours, I painted stencils on some of my cupboards, and made my own cinder block CD case (yeah, CD's were still a thing back then, lol). Maybe a makeover of your room will help. Do you think your father or mother would be willing to help you/let you do this? Again, if they don't want to help/pay, but if they will let you redecorate, ask a trusted adult family member/family friend for help :).", "It's very understandable in the situation you described.
