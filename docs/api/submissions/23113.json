I have 4 younger siblings who are all still in high school, 15/M & 15/M (twins), 16/F and 17/M.\n\nSo this weekend somebody my siblings\u2019 know from school had a party that they all went to. None of them planned ahead to have a safe way to get home afterwards so they called me asking for a ride. This would be fine except for the fact that I can only fit 3 other people in my car and there are 4 of them. My siblings assumed that my sister would just sit on somebody\u2019s lap, but I said no to that idea because 1) it\u2019s not safe if we get in an accident and 2) I didn\u2019t want to give the cops a reason to pull us over.\n\nI told them to do rock-paper-scissors to figure out who was getting in the car with me and then whoever lost would have to call someone else. But it ended up being one of the twins who got left out, so then the other twin refused to go either because they\u2019re complete babies about having to be split up. I didn\u2019t care to argue with them so I told my other siblings to let their friends know that I had an extra seat if anyone else needed a ride.\n\nIn the end I drove home my sister, my oldest brother, and also one other girl (15?/F) who asked. The twins eventually got some other friend of theirs who wasn\u2019t at the party to come get them and bring them home, but then they complained to our parents about how I just left them stranded.\n\nMy parents and the twins are saying that I should\u2019ve squeezed everybody in the car instead of offering the spot to a random person. The twins are just being obnoxious I think, but my parents\u2019 argument is that it was more irresponsible to leave my siblings in that state at a stranger\u2019s house than to have one of them not wear a seatbelt for a few minutes.\n\nSo AITA?\n\nETA: We don't have Uber here, we're really rural. Also, I did offer to make a second trip to come back for the twins but they didn't want to wait the 40mins for me to come back. That's part of the argument they were making about why I should just let them both get into the car.", "created_utc": 1690305639, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/159esob/aita_for_only_giving_some_of_my_teenage_siblings/", "score": 323, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
