You know what they want? A big party. To show off to family and friends. Godparents is a meaningless thing except expecting sightly better presents at birthdays and Christmas. \n\nOne of my siblings caused a hoo haa with her inlaws because she refused to get her children Christened.

Nobody should be able to force you to commit to any religious traditions if you don't want to.", "It's really important but you can get it done if you pay the priest \ud83e\udd14\ud83e\udd23 NTA!", "NTA. You can't get confirmation or be a godparent if you don't believe in God and the tenets of the specific denomination, so you don't have the qualifications to be one. Any priest would respect the fact that you're not a believer and would never try to pressure you into getting confirmed, and certainly would not allow you to be a godparent. Just tell them you don't have the qualifications. If they don't stop annoying you, talk to their priest, and he should put a stop to it.", "Wait,  what...Auntie wants you to lie about your beliefs and intentions with regard to *her* God? I am a little horrified by the flexibility of her conscience and applaud you for not taking the easy path of making the right noises to appease her even though you wouldn't mean a word.  \n\nI wish your SiL a healthy,  uncomplicated pregnancy that ends with the easy birth of one of those rare & wonderful \"happy babies\" that never gets colicky,  rarely fusses for the sake of fussing and takes easily to a predictable and sane sleep schedule.", "NTA\n\nYou shouldn't be forced to take part in a religion when you don't want to.\n\nI've known a few religious people who only ever paid lip service and attended Chapel at Christmas but still felt the need to force their beliefs on me when they found out I never made my confirmation, I told them straight that my religion abandoned me despite my strong belief and hard work so now it and anyone that tries to force it on me can all go and take a flying fuck to themselves.\nI would advise a less ruder way than mine of telling your family where to stick their beliefs though.", "NTA - you are right. She is wrong.", "Lifelong Catholic here and a former seminary student: you NEVER pay anything a sacrament. Which is what confirmation is. Unfortunately unless you are a practicing Catholic, over 16, and have received baptism, first communion, and confirmation, you cannot be a godparent. In addition, unless you are willing to help the parents to raise the child as Catholic, you cannot be a Godparent. Some localities might fudge on this but it really is not possible given your circumstances.", "NTA. And if your brother doesn't care then really NTA.", "NTA\n\nYou don't believe in one of many gods made up by humans.", "Fun fact if she tries to bribe the priest to get you a confirmation you don't want you can write the Vatican! I would immediately try to find the information for your local Bishop and Arch Bishop and explain that this is not something you want and you are not trying to disrespect their beliefs by performing a masquerade for the benefit of a title since your role as a God Parent is to help guide their faith in God. \n\nThis doesn't have to be an Atheist Vs Catholic argument but framing it about respect for their religion and their rules is going to get you much farther.", "NTA they are stupid.", "NTA, and i dont know about your country or religion, but my family is catholic (i'm not), but i did first communion and just that, than stopped oing to chruch and everything. Now i'm my niece's godmother, and i didnt need to do anything esle in the church, to do it", "Excuse me, how dare you be an atheist without the confirmation??!?!\n\nThat's kind of the funny thing of almost every atheist I know! (Including me)\n\nNTA", "NTA. I love this as a case study in the angry/vocal atheist trope.  You can never be quiet enough, passive enough for them. If you\u2019re not explicitly granting them social consent, you\u2019re an angry atheist.", "NTA\n\nFirst, confirmation isn't adult baptism, but its rather \"confirming\" your infant baptism (both in Christian and in Roman Catholic circles). \n\nSecond, why would they push confirmation on a kid who doesn't believe in God? I'm not of the Catholic background, I'm Reformed, and we have a sort of confirmation--for children who were baptized as infants to confess and profess their faith to the congregation, thus \"confirming\" (of sorts) their infant baptism. We would *never* be ok with someone doing it if they aren't a believer. \n\nSame follows for actual adult baptisms--if they don't actually believe as an adult, they shouldn't be baptized.\n\nYour family are hypocrites. They want you to do that sign despite it being meaningless (to you and even to them) and as you stated most of them don't even regularly atend church.\n\nThey shouldn't bully you into it, and you shouldn't go through something you don't actually believe in.", "NTA. The Catholic church uses an all or nothing system to keep people from leaving. If you  don't have your Baptism cert with endorsements for communion and confirmation, no church marriage. Want to marry a non-catholic? Take that blasphemy outside. Baptizing your baby? Get those documents for yourself and the godparents.", "NTA.\n\nI'm in the same boat as you. Went through first communion and then just...stopped putting the work into it. \n\nAnd you are correct that faking a baptism would be an insult. To them, their beliefs and the beliefs of true believes.\n\nNext time someone tells you about it - ask them - would they rather break bread with an honest atheist, or would they prefer to break bread with people who put forth effort into merely appearing to be Christians? Because if that's what they prefer...I'd start to put some distance between myself and them.", "Also, OP is 100% right to say that pretending to believe in God when they don't would be disrespectful to people who really believe. Basically it's disrespecting BOTH genuine religion AND their own genuine atheism. OP has their head on straighter than some of their family here--their line of thinking is the image of integrity.", "Depending on the Church's denomination, your last statement may not be true.", "For many religions you do indeed have to be to be a GODparent.", "as an atheist my understanding is incomplete but is not the role of a god parent to assist in the religious education of the child. \r  \ndon't think an atheist is qualified for that, i would certainly turn down the position if offered by a genuinely religious family.", "At least in Germany you must had a confirmation to become a god parent.", "How does that work? The whole purpose supposedly of a god parent it to keep the child on the path to god.", "If the person being baptized is Catholic, the godparent or sponsor MUST be Catholic.  \n\nThe purpose of the sponsor is to raise the child in the church if something happens to the parents.", "Ramen, my brother, ramen to you", "Yes the hell she was bullying.\n\n> this is my first nephew/niece and I have to be a godmother.\n\nThis is pressuring.\n\n> She told me that it's unfair to my brother\n\nThis is manipulation.\n\n> I always have to be vocal about my atheism\n\nThis is gaslighting.\n\nAuntie is an asshole.", "You have to be confirmed to \u201clegally in the churches eyes\u201d be a godparent. Is it possible that the other godparent was \u201cin full communion\u201d with the church? The term \u201cin full communion\u201d means that you have been baptized, made your first communion and your confirmation.", "Ehhhh in the US at least, the term \"godparent\" can be a lot more honorary than it is religious. It can be the person you denote as the future carer of your child should something bad happen to both parents, or someone you deem as a close enough friend of yours to be an honorary family member of your child. For example, my godparents are my dads jewish best friend and my moms hindu best friend. Like, obviously those two did not religiously guide me, they've just played the rolls of my really cool \"aunt\" and \"uncle\", and if my parents were to have died wile I was a minor, they were legally in charge of making sure my parents will was properly executed as they're both lawyers. My boyfriend has the same situation with his godparents, his Nina (common word for godmother in hispanic cultures) is his moms catholic best friend and all she's ever done religiously for him was be at his baptism when he was a baby. Other than that, she's just his cool aunt.", "In some families it's more of a mentorship role than a religious role.  If their family is OK with it and their church is ok with it, then it's not an issue.  Basically you agree to help them become a good person, guide them in life, and be there for them emotionally.", "> not the role of a god parent to assist in the religious education of the child.\n\nNot always. \n\nWhere I am from the Godparents are the people who have agreed to take in a child should something happen to the parents leading to their demise.\n\nMy godparents never taught me anything about religion. My parents just made sure to teach me that if something happened to them, my aunt and uncle would take care of me until I could care for myself. \n\nMy mother was godmother to one of my cousins and his home life wasn't always...the best (his mother remarried an abusive person), so he spent a lot of time at our place. Because he knew he'd always have space at our place.", "Depends on the diocese.  We only needed one of the god parents to be fully confirmed as a Catholic. The other could be any denomination.  Though in our case, the Catholic godparent was an actual Catholic priest, so that might have had something to do with it.", "Not sure if this is aimed at me. Personally I don't care what anyone believes - if there is a God and an afterlife, then that is when we find the truth and God sorts people if that is the case. Until then, live and let live. But I do think if you take communion or confirmation, then you pay at least some respect to the beliefs held (by that particular church). But no one should ever be forced to take part.", "Great comment", "Yup! It very much depends. For example, my husband and I are Catholic, and my best friend is Jewish, while her husband is agnostic. They're raising their child Jewish. We're their baby's godparents in the sense that, should anything happen to my friend and her husband, my husband and I will take care of their baby. However! My friend does expect that I will do my best to keep her child in touch with her Jewish heritage (although she doesn't expect us to join a synagogue/go to services).", "It can be, in the US, but there's also much stricter religious groups where it can't. My sibling is having the same debate with the in-laws. The church is trying to force the parents to join the church by harassing them into a christening. The grandparents tried to do it without the parents and the church refused, and the church is pressuring the grandparents to force their extended family to join, so all groups are kinda mad over it. My sibling has said that they and their spouse decided their child can choose what they want when they are old enough, but the pressure is causing a lot of family problems.\n\nThe whole thing sounds abusive to me, as does the situation OP finds themself in.", "No, that has nothing to do with it. Only 1 godparent needs to be catholic for a child to be baptized in the Catholic Church. Don\u2019t let anyone tell you otherwise.", "Yeah, it kind of is.  OPs aunt knows her status, any inquiry after that is bullying.", "But that's not what Aunt did.  Aunt didn't accept OP's answer and went on to try to pressure and guilt-trip her.\n\n> I told her that I am not going to do that as this is against not only my views but also I think that this is disrespectful to people who actually believe in God. She told me that it's unfair to my brother and I always have to be vocal about my atheism etc.", "It sounds abusive because it *is* abusive.", "My guess is that the church knew that they could be sued if they baptized without the parent's permission. That's why they refused.", "It\u2019s been a while, but I remember with both of my daughters they made the process as easy as possible.  They\u2019re mostly just happy you\u2019re raising your children Catholic.  My one daughter\u2019s godmother\u2019s proof of confirmation was in Sinhalese.  No one questioned it.", "I got it, we disagree. Its cool. I don't think this single convo with close family member gets there. Now if afterwards they are still going on about it, I'd be more incline to say the line was cross. But a first convo? Naw. But thats me, and we can have different views on it.", "Now you've moved the goalposts, from \"initially ask/inquire\" (to which OP clearly said no) to \"this single convo\" (in which aunt harassed OP *after* OP clearly said no)."]}
