Everyone is rather happy and are talking about it etc. So the other day I was talking with my aunt about it and she mentioned christening and then asked me when I would do confirmation. For those who don't know - confirmation is like adult baptism, where for christians is the affirmation of your belief in God. In my country almost everyone has it, because it is a part of religion class in secondary school. But I did not attend the class so I do not have confirmation. \n\nI never believed in God, even when I was a child and I was very vocal about it to my father. He stopped trying to force the belief on me after the first communion and it wasn't even a fight to get him to sign me an excuse from the religion class for the rest of my education. Both grandmothers and grandfathers did not know about it. I never mentioned it and whenever the topic came I just didn't participate even when I knew they were trying to bait me. I also figured that I don't have to go to church by the age of 11, because they let me go alone. So every Sunday I was going on a walk. \n\nI think my atheism came out at the time everyone my age was supposed to get confirmation. Nobody commented on it, but I think that they noticed that I didn't invite anyone to the ceremony. And suddenly after that everyone stopped trying to talk about God around me. \n\nBut some days ago my aunt asked me when I was going to confirm, because this is my first nephew/niece and I have to be a godmother. I thought that she was joking, but she told me that I can pay a priest to get it in a week. I told her that I am not going to do that as this is against not only my views but also I think that this is disrespectful to people who actually believe in God. She told me that it's unfair to my brother and I always have to be vocal about my atheism etc., but I successfully changed the topic.  \n\nThe thing is - I never said anything. I always avoid the topic while I feel that my family tries to bait and force me on their beliefs. Also I think that they are hypocrites, because only my maternal grandparents are regularly going to church. I don't understand why they whould bully me into faith when they should be happy for my brother and SIL baby. And I say they, because I have a feeling that this topic won't end with my aunt.", "created_utc": 1695666775, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16rzzcl/aita_for_refusing_to_get_adult_baptisim/", "score": 26, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I'm sure the Bible says something about hypocriscy.\n\nAs to being a Godparent, that could be tricky depending on how religious your brother and SiL are. Part of being a godparent is guidance in the faith until the child gets to make own decision at confirmation.

So, let the Godparents handle God, and you can take care of heavy questions about life (and in time sex/relationships) for which the parents and Godparents won't be comfortable.\n\nI learned so much about life from my aunt's...much more than they will ever realize.

I could be wrong but they aren't pressuring you to fake belief, just take Jesus shower.", "NTA and you are correct, it is disrespectful to both you and others who practice your family's religion. If it's a requirement for being a godparent, just bow out.", "Politely refusing to participate in a religious ceremony when someone asks you directly about it is not \"being vocal with your atheism\". \n\nNTA no question.
