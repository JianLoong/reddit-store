I am not even sure she is consciously aware she is doing it anymore, it's that automatic for her.

And im going to assume this is PTSD related and not just \"anti-social\" behavior because you do mention trauma.\n\nToo sensitive is exactly what anxiety and PTSD is - but its not one you can control   Being hugged and touched by multiple strangers is a sure way to trigger an episode.\n\nHow is it that people don't understand physical boundaries?   How do people in today's world not get \"dent touch me unless i say its ok?\"  Honestly, even without anxiety, anti-social behavior and/or PTSD - \"dont touch me\" should always end the touching.   No matter what.  Without shaming.. questioning... berating.. .belittling... etc.\n\nYou are NTA.. and not \"oversensitive\" and you were being as polite as you could until you reached overload.   You handled it as best anyone could, but these people dont seem to understand anything except their own needs - certainly not personal space or boundries.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAdding this as EDIT:  This is also how to NOT raise a child - by telling them unwanted touch is ok if someone really wants it.    smh.. you really could use a bF with a clue.", "NTA.  Respect.  This is what is lacking here.  You have boundaries, for whatever reason does not matter, and have requested those to be respected.  Trauma is a real thing and when someone even hints at some trauma underlying a reason they won't do something, I go beyond basic respect for their personal space and will actively intercept on their behalf.  Your boyfriend should be doing that, but instead is taking his friend's side.  Rethink this relationship.", "I don't like being touched either.  In fact, my mom said I used to push her away when I was a toddler, cause I didn't want to be held.  I must have a really good resting bitch face, because not many people try to hug me (and I live in the south).  If someone tries to get that close to me, I will just rear back and not let them get close enough.  Your BF is being a jerk for not clearly explaining to his friends that they should not crowd you.", "AITA for rejecting them and leaving the situation?\n\nYou did NOT reject them.  You established a boundary that they ignored.  And you took yourself out of a bad situation when it turned bad - which was 100% the right thing to do.  The only thing you did \"wrong\" was apologize for not wanting to be touched.  You made that clear in advance, and that's not something you need to apologize for.\n\nThese people (boyfriend included) have shown you who they are.  They don't care about you or your boundaries.

Two colleagues thankfully had my back och deflected an got me out of the room. They had more compassion and awareness for my bodily integrity than your boyfriend had in this situation. NTA"]}
