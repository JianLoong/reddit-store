You are old enough now to have a concept that adults should get their shit together before becoming parents so that their children don't suffer.  Yet, instead of doing the work that realization requires, you're blaming everyone but your mother so you're saying your brother who got out is somehow the immature one.\n\nChanging my vote to NAH because you're coming from such a place of trauma and making excuses for your mom that you really can't see that you're being incredibly unfair to your brother.

Although given her wildy over-dramatic response and demand for penanance over a social media post, I'm guessing there isn't.\n\nSo you probably weren't wrong to say something because this effects a lot of people, including you.

Knowing someone well doesn\u2019t equal being able to read minds. The isolation and refusal to budge is his wife being stubborn at best and abusive at worst.

Words that she didn't even need to mean, just say... She could have just said 'im sorry for posting that' and she isn't willing to do that in order to see her grandchildren.

They both like to control how other people talk and won't back down if the other person doesn't perform according to their unspoken expectations....\n\nNo shock your brother married someone with similar traits to your mom. \n\nThat said you mention your brother refuses to let the kids see ANYONE in the family... Not just your mom but EVERYONE... And that's where his wife's behavior becomes concerning and where the missing reasons become suspect... \n\nEither he is absolutely lying to you about the reason and scapegoating his spouse (he doesn't want you all to know the kids but is blaming her for it)... and HE is the one that doesn't want his kids growing up knowing you all... \n\nOr he and the kids are likely in a dangerous/controlling situation. And it's impossible to know that based on the post... \n\nBut if you think your brother is being controlled/abused calling him an incompetent parent probably isn't going to help him be a more competent parent and seems like it's isolating him more. \n\nYou don't even seem to be coming from a place of concern or wanting to see the kids yourself.

Is your mom respectful of boundaries or ask permission before doing things that will impact her children and their families? Does she give unsolicited advice? Etc. While someone might not have the right skills to raise children, it doesn\u2019t necessarily mean they\u2019re a bad person- just that they should either learn those skills or not have kids.

Its a privilege not a right.\n\nIn general its the norm to check in with the parents before announcing a birth on social media, because a lot of parents want to announce it themselves. The fact other new parents have been fine with her doing it doesn't mean the next ones will be. Its on her to ask each time, not assume its fine to announce a birth unless told otherwise.\n\nThe fact she was a bad parent to you is relevant information for your brother, because it means she is capable of treating children badly and there is no guarantee a grandchild won't end up being her target. What if the reason she mistreated you was because she disliked a physical or personality attribute the grandchild also has?\n\nIf you haven't left anything else out, and it was your brother posting I would have voted E-S-H and said she was in the wrong, but their reaction was too harsh.\n\nHowever your attitude towards it and refusal to hold your mother accountable in any way make YTA.", "I'm sorry for your parents and you, but you have no \"right\" to see your brothers kid.

Also he's allowed to change his mind if it means supporting his wife who's just given birth.\n\nMaybe his wife is just a controlling nut but with the information you've given it's hard for me to give a judgement", "Over nothing too! I\u2019m saying this as someone who isn\u2019t posting her children on socials at all. Grandma deleted the post too so it\u2019s getting dragged out", "That's good she improved.  But I think you need to let your brother navigate his own relationship with her.  You can talk to him about letting **you** see the kids, but don't try to argue your mom's case to him.", "Look at it from a different perspective. Once these kids get older, they're going to find out the truth. Then, their parents can either lie or something else.\n\nIt's no longer on you and your family to cater to them.  If they want something, they have her side of the family. You just keep your door open for the kids.", "What country are you guys in, if you don\u2019t mind answering?", "She wouldn\u2019t necessarily win if she did though, she doesn\u2019t have a relationship with either grandchild so there may not be \u201csufficient close family ties\u201d which is what the laws in Germany state. Also, conflict between the parents and grandparents comes into play with these cases.", "I\u2019m glad that she has gone to therapy and done the work she needed to get better. Unfortunately she made an assumption that your brother and his wife would be ok with the same rules as the rest of the family. While yes your brother should have spoke up, your mom still should have asked first because he and his wife are different people than the rest of you. Some people are extremely protective of their children\u2019s online presence and it doesn\u2019t sound like your mom had a strong relationship with sil before this happened. It would be nice if everybody could reconcile but you can\u2019t be the one to do it now that bro and sil said they aren\u2019t interested. If you do then you would be triangulating and you\u2019ll like find yourself cut off by them as well if you haven\u2019t already.", "I hope he's not expecting her from her from now on as he expected her to read his mind.", "All she had to say was some words too... Words that she didn't even need to mean, just say... She could have just said 'im sorry for posting that' and she isn't willing to do that in order to see her grandkid... \n\nThat said you mention your brother refuses to let the kids see ANYONE in the family... Not just your mom but EVERYONE... And that's where his wife's behavior becomes concerning. \n\nEither he is absolutely lying to you about the reason and scapegoating his spouse (he doesn't want you all to know the kids but is blaming her for it)... Or he and the kids are likely in a dangerous/controlling situation. And it's impossible to know that based on the post... But if you think your brother is being controlled/abused calling him an incompetent parent probably isn't going to help him be a more competent parent.", "Just because you have compassion for and have forgiven your mother for the childhood abuse and/or neglect, that doesn't mean your brother has to.  I know you say she was good to him, but if she wasn't good to you, he still had to witness that and witnessing bad parenting can be traumatic on its own for a child, even if they aren't the primary target.\n\nHe wants better for his wife and children than a \"grandmother\" who refuses to apologize or accept any boundaries the kiddos' *parents* ask for.  Apologizing for making them feel bad isn't the same as apologizing for wronging them in the first place.\n\nYTA.  Maybe if you take a step back from your mom and approach your brother about fixing your sibling relationship, you might get to meet your niblings, but he has no reason to talk with you in good faith until you agree that discussion of your mother is off the table.  You're pushy, and he's right to not appreciate that.", "> It is a priviledge. However to me it is a right to know your grandparents unless you have really important reasons not to: f.e. endangering the child or Something similar but less dramatic. Which was not the Case; my brother said years before he had his own child how well my mother does a\u00df a grandparent.\n\nAs long as your brother doesn't lie to his kids that your mum is dead or something, and they are free to reach out themselves as adults, the fact it's a privilege to know grandchildren outweighs the right to know grandparent.\n\n> As stated above, the announcement was very basic and noone, except for those who knew who was expecting, was any wiser. We all had Set down together when my First stepsister had her twins and discussed this. He was part of that and have his input. He never once said he would not want it for his children. And he saw her posting it for all 6 grandkids before his.\n\nThe basic-ness of her announcement doesn't change much, she still should ask every time. Your SIL, the child's mother, wasn't present for this big chat was she? And people might change their minds. I can see why your mum made the mistake of not asking beforehand. I cannot see why she thinks she did nothing wrong in retrospect by not asking beforehand and still refuses to apologise for making the post.\n\n> My mother was a bad mother to me, but not my brother. She struggled with loving a girl. My brother knows and acknowledged that. He also knows that she went through years and years of therapy after i moved away. \n\nThe fact your mum mistreated you because you were a girl makes it even more ridiculous that you don't think that's relevant info for your brother, since any children he has have a 50% chance of being girls and he may not consider it worth the risk.\n\n> I am not sure in which way my mother should be Made accountable. He was aware of the posting going in for years. She took it down immediately after they called and apologized for making them feel bad with it. To me, she handled the situation as well as possible. She can't travel through time to unpost it. Trust me, she would.\n\nApologising for making someone feel bad, rather than what you did, is not an apology.\n\nYou could hold your mother accountable for not checking with the parents of the baby who's birth she announced, not accepting that it was a mistake not to check in before announcing the birth, and for giving them cause for concern about how she might treat a granddaughter. Edit: and for not giving a real apology.\n\n**Edit 2:** Do you not see the cognitive dissonance in thinking your brother and sister in law are the only petty ones here when your mother has refused for years not to give a real apology on principle? \n\nEven regardless of opinions on whether she did anything worth apologising for, that indicates her pride is greater than her sadness at not knowing those grandchildren.\n\n**Edit 3:** Just realised, the people who would have known SIL was pregnant beforehand are exactly the people the parents most want to be the ones to announce to! It would have been less bad if your mother told strangers.", "Here\u2019s the tricky part..your brother and his wife do not think it\u2019s a right. And you and your mom have to recognize that. It doesn\u2019t matter what you guys think or believe, they are the parents. It seems like the entire situation got over blown", "That is a stretch.  The mom didn't know it was a problem when she did it and apologized for causing a problem.  The idea that means she would be unwilling to follow the directions of the parents doesn't make any sense at all.  If the \"directions\" are unspoken, the only asshole is the SIL who expected everyone to read her mind.", "She did apologize. Not enough for her though. She apologized that she upset them by posting something they didn't want to. Then they called her dumb and said she should have known better and that they don't have to tell her that they don't like that kind of stuff.\n\nIt was not a lack of apology. She just wanted my mom in her knees after verbally abusing her.\n\nThe Situation itself was bizarre to be honest. How someone can even talk to another person the way my sil and brother talked to my mom is beyond me. It was terrifying", "Of course there might be stuff i am not aware of, but i am proud to say that, even though it is not a relationship built on motherly love, that my mom and me confide in each other about most things now.\n\nSil was around for a very short time before she got pregnant and locked herself up during pregnancy. My Mother met her 2 or 3 times before the baby was born. So they didn't really have any kind of relationship.\n\nThey were not about his children. This was his firstborn.\nThe reason why my mom thought he was fine with it, was because all children helped writing the first post, including my brother and we said that like this noone can really get any upsetting information in social media and we all said we are fine with it If she does that.  \nIt was also brought up several times that she does that for every kid and showed the posts to everyone. (She liked to add cringy grandparentcomics or flower/season pictures and such to make the post more pretty.) \nHe never said anything negative about it or that he doesn't want that for his children.\n\nI think, what my mother forgot to consider, was that she didn't really know his wife. She knew the other partners of my silblings for longer and they all gave her positive responses. My sil seems to have an issue with Facebook in general. It's the only social media my mother uses. \n\nSil posted about a lot of stuff in her pregnancy and her children on Instagram.", "She even went there personally and apologized with a small package of babystuff and so on. His neighbors Went us a picture how it went straight into the trash....\n\nMy mom honestly isn't great and struggles with some social cues even after therapy, but she put a lot of effort into fixing this misunderstanding.\n\nSaid nephew turned 5 in january.", "I tried to solve the situation as an oustander. I personally don't want my brother in my life after that for different reasons...\nIt's been a few years now, but the situation is still in my head, because it gets mentioned every now and then.", "Yeah. My parents have a small place where they put all the christmas presents and such for them. If they ever come they will have grown out of them, but they say they will See that they never forgot them anyway. We also have a small scrapbook where we put major events and photos in, so they can be part of it.  \n\nThe kids will always have a place in the family.", "We live in germany", "My mom didn't really have the chance to have any sort of relationship with my sil. She got pregnant shortly after they became a couple and didn't feel Well in her pregnancy so she wouldn't let people visit or replied much to any other contact.\nI agree that my mom should have asked, but i can understand why she didn't. It was some sort of unspoken rule between us kids that we agree to it, because we set the boundries together. \n\nIn the end it was a misunderstanding. \nMaybe they are extremely protective, they do share lots in Instagram though. \n\nRight now i have no wish to fix my own relationship with my brother and his wife. They blamed my daughter and Made her cry and i am still not ready to forgive them. (It was Not related to my mothers fallout with them)\n\nMy mother reached out via letter recently, but didn't get any response.", "Maybe i have too much pride, but i would not want to say an apology i don't mean, neither would i want to receive one that is not honest.\n\nMy mother could have done more, surely. I just think it questionable she has to in the first place. Deleting and apologizing personally should be enough for a rather small misunderstanding. \n\nI don't know his wife too well to really judge her character, but there have been another few things that don't sit right with me about her behaviour in general, that i found about recently. One of them being that she cut out extended parts of the family after, for similar reasons. F.e. my great aunt because she celebrated her 80th birthday on a day where she had a soccer tournament. She cut off his best friend (they knew each other since they were toddlers) because he planned the bachelor party for my brother and she didn't Like it, because in her family it is a tradition that the her father is part of it. And a few other things.\n\nSo he might just be in a toxic relationship, but i didn't know that back then. He and his wife haven't been together for long before she got pregnant. So i really can't say i know her well.\n\nI appreciate the Input. Thanks man", "You're getting downvotes but...\n\n> All she had to say was some words too... Words that she didn't even need to mean, just say... She could have just said 'im sorry for posting that' and she isn't willing to do that in order to see her grandkid... \n\nYup.\n\nIf her pride has been winning that battle for this many years then she doesn't want to see the grandkids all that much.", "I would understand that, If that was the case. What he said to me was that he doesn't want to argue with His wife even though he knows she is overreacting and that he can't choose sides because He will get shit from her family. So he does not. \n\nI will not fix the relationship between my brother and me for different reasons. \n\nMaybe you are right and i was pushy. However i did ASK beforehand if they want to talk to me and see If we can find a solution while i am there to help communicate and they agreed.\n\nThe point is, she didn't wrong them. They didn't want her to post it but didn't communicate that at all. He even have his input about the post rules before he had his kids. How should she have known? Sure she could have asked, but under these circumstances i don't think it was her fault. She took it down immediately too.", "I think the issue here is that i still see it as an apology. It is the way she was taught to express herself in therapy when she is unsure about who is at fault. She didn't want to hurt them, she wanted to express her happiness about her expanding family. I agree she should have asked, but i can also see why she didn't. It was never brought up and never was an issue with anyone. \n\nI have two girls and still trust my mother with them, because she resolved that repressed trauma she had and never once have any indication that she would treat any of her 15(17 with my brothers included) grandchildren badly. \n\nMy Brother also said that was not an issue. The issue is that His wife does not accept her apology. \n\nMy mother did not announce it the day Mats was born, but a few days after. She also doesn't really share any contacts with my brother or sil because they don't use Facebook. Except maybe few people out of our family and our old neighbors. So the issue was not that she announced it before they could or anything. They just didn't want it in Facebook, because Facebook is bad.", "I agree that the whole situation blew up. It's been 5 years this month. \n\nMy mother and me recognize that we can't change it and while my mother still tries to reach out regularily, i don't really find it in me to care anymore.\n\nLast time i talked to my brother he was nothing like the person i grew up with and it's not a person i am happy to have around me. It baffles me how much someone can change it that small amount of time.\n\nAnd he brought me into a situation where i feel the need to protect my own children from people like them.", "No, she said she was sorry for \u201cwhat it caused,\u201d not that she was sorry for doing it. Which is a non-apology.", "This really feels like a \u201clast straw\u201d kind of thing. How was the relationship with brother and SIL prior to this?  Do SIL or your mother have a history of narcissistic behavior?  Something just doesn\u2019t add up. It wasn\u2019t this one thing. \n\nNo one up and goes no contact over something one family member did. They do that when they feel their safety - physical or emotional - is at risk, and at the end of a long journey of dysfunction.", "It's time to cut them both off. They can just watch from FB as you and your family celebrate without them.", "Oh wow\u2026a very very big jump what I\u2019m about to say right now. It sounds like your SIL has a personality disorder.", "Gotcha! Yeah, thank you!! I can see family culture being a bit different than what I\u2019m used to \ud83d\ude01", "Jesus. He really is in a toxic relationship. Sounds like it doesn't matter what your Mum said to be honest.", "Or she doesn't want years of this nonsense - of someone claiming a grave offense over something commonplace they had never discussed before. That dance would old very fast.", "Sounds like they don't want to find a solution anymore after all.  Drop it.", "He did choose sides.  He chose his wife and children, which is what a man is supposed to do when he leaves his first family and starts his own.\n\nYou think your SIL is unreasonable, but maybe she's allowing him to use her as the excuse.  Either way, he gave a clear answer, and you insulted him instead of respecting it.\n\nAnd your title is misleading as hell: there's no \"need\" or \"right\" that a child has to know extended family whom their parents disapprove of.", "Just because you trust your mother with your girls doesn't mean anyone else has too. There's even a possibility you and your other siblings have a lower expectation of acceptable behaviour from her if your mother mistreated you. Like if a dog always tried to bite me I would consider it lying quietly in a corner and only growling when I went near it as it being \"good\". But other people who's expectations weren't lowered wouldn't consider that good dog behaviour.\n\nHonestly I can't blame your SIL for not accepting an \"I'm sorry you were hurt\" apology. Lots of people don't accept those because they mean the person isn't actually sorry about what they did.\n\nI'm glad to hear that your brother and SIL got to be the ones that told their friends and family though.\n\nHowever I'm still sticking with it would have been ESH if its all exactly as you say and your brother was posting but YTA in this case. Its not your call who is in contact with who, and your mum not being able to see even the tiniest bit of fault that would allow her to apologise properly is pretty sad. Especially as she claims to be upset about the lack of contact. \n\nYou'd think she'd be able to look past her pride and say something like: \"I'm sorry I made the post without checking with you first and I won't do anything like that again. At the time I thought it would be fine as *brother* knew I made those posts and hadn't told me not to, but I see now I should have played it safe and checked in with both of you\".\n\nI am interested to know about the grandparents rights laws where you are if you feel like telling me though. E.g. do grandparents have the right for an established relationship with their grandchild to continue if its beneficial to the child? Or do they literally have the right to time with a grandchild they have never met before regardless of the parent's wishes?", "I have a similar type dynamic in my family, where we just kind of do our own things. It sucks because it could be so much better, and I tried to bring us a bit more together. I ended up just stopping because at a certain point, you realize if they wanted to be there, they would.\n\nIt also sounds like your brother has changed a lot too. I think you can rest knowing that you did what you thought was right and what you could", "Why should she be sorry for doing it when she wasn't informed not to?", "My mother and brother had a very strong relationship, at least before his wifes pregnancy. My mother and sil never had a relationship to begin with, because sil got pregnant very shortly after meeting my brother and she barely talked to her before. She didn't feel Well in her pregnancy and locked herself up, didn't attend any birthday parties or other social events. Sil also didn't react when asked whether she and the baby are okay, saying she was so tired she Always forgot to answer messages.\n\nMy mother has a diagnosed narcissistic disorder and was treated for it for almost 16 years now. Excessive therapy, several clinics and medication in between. She has been very stable for a long time though and learned how to handle most situations pretty well by now. \n\nShe has issues however to apologize for things she Sees No fault in, as in this case. That's why her therapist told her to apologize for something she felt at fault for. (Which is hard to admit for narcissistic people in the first place)\n\nThat's why she apologized for hurting them with her post, because she just wanted to share the happiness of her grandsons birth online and Nor hurt or upset anyone with it and she honestly believed them to be fine with her posting Else she would not have done it. She told them that too.", "Yeah its weird that its everyone's take that announcing a baby's birth before the parents get to without checking with said parents first is totally fine and SIL has no cause to be upset about it.\n\nEven if all OP's mother's other children were fine with it, it doesn't mean they all will be and SIL was never consulted at any stage.\n\nOP acts like it was ok because the post was so basic and \"only people who knew SIL was pregnant would know who the post was about\", as if those aren't the exact people the baby's parents would be most excited to tell. Like you know, friends and relatives like SIL's parents.\n\nEven if we accept that the mother took BILs silence as permission to go ahead, the fact that to this day all she will say is she is sorry about how it made them feel, not sorry for making the post, is ridiculous.", "I guess so, yeah. It's just sad.", "I think children have that right. If you take away the chance to have a loving grandparents because of petty reasons you are selfish. \n\nIn German law, grandparents have a \"right of access\" to their grandchildren. If my mom wanted to sue them, they would have to prove that she is a bad influence or danger to the children, else they have to make sure the kids See their grandparents regularily.\n\nIt is something my mother doesn't want to force though.\n\nI agree that i was being too harsh with my words and should have said it differently. It doesn't change my opinion that he is taking the chance to have two more wonderful grandparents away from his kids, because his wife is being unreasonable.\nIf they hide behind this and have keep their real motivation to cut ties hidden, then they are spineless liars. People can't change and get better If they are being lied to.", "I think it\u2019s a pretty common rule not to give out information about people\u2019s children without being asked.", "I say this as gently as I can: it is not your brother's responsibility to help anyone to get better, if having those conversations would do him or his family harm at this point in their journey.", "There was zero information in the post. OP literally said it is always a generic Facebook post. Since brother knew that happened, it was on him and his wife to put on their big boy and big girl pants and ask that she not do that.", "It's definitely not as common as you think. Also, read the post. Baby's name, info, and parental info was not even included. All that was posted was that she was excited for the new little one. \n\nSo yea, you kind of *do* have to tell someone when you don't want a boundary crossed *when they do not know you have the boundary*.", "She doesn't mention names or who even had the child so she didn't do anything wrong."]}
