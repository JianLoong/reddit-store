Just because this girl is bi doesn't mean she cannot have a friendship with a straight person. It doesn't sound like this girl made any advances after this, and if she is able to be friends with your gf she probably isn't head over heels in love with her. These types of assumptions you make and the conclusion you jumped to are harmful stereotypes people in the LGBTQ+ community face daily.

I understand you're insecure but you can't expect your partner to stop being friends with someone. You need to learn to trust your girlfriend when she says she isn't interested in the other girl romantically or sexually.", "YTA. You're jealous and controlling. You do not get to dictate to your gf who she can and can't be friends with. You completely lack any trust in your partner to be able to choose you over another woman to whom your gf is definitely not attracted, because you irrationally believe that the other woman will somehow trick or lure your gf to be in a relationship with her. Straight people aren't able to be lured in that manner; if a relationship develops between two women or two men, then there was always an attraction and/or some level of bisexuality/bi-curiosity with both partners. Instead of trying to force your gf to essentially pick you over her friends, try examining inside yourself what is making you have this mistrust, jealousy, and desire to control your gf.", "YTA. For all you know your GF has had a frank discussion with the girl that her feelings beyond friendship are not reciprocated but if the friend can be ok with that she would love to continue their friendship.

Her romantically pursuing your girlfriend is.", "YTA. \n\nThere seems to be missing pieces. She told your girlfriend she had a crush on her. Your girlfriend said she is straight.

If OP were a woman, and the boyfriend was hanging out with a *guy* friend who said he has a crush on him, and the boyfriend was *not* bi/gay, then it would be applicable here. The key is that the gf is not attracted to girls. Therefore, the friend isn't a \"threat\" to the OP. \n\nOP should not be controlling which friends his gf hangs out with. No one gets to dictate anyone's friendships. That's how you end up in an abusive, controlling relationship where you have no support system so you feel trapped. If OP doesn't trust his girlfriend then he needs to evaluate if he wants to be in a relationship with her, not try to control who her friends are. He needs to discuss with his gf *why* it makes him uncomfortable, and *listen* to his gf when she expresses her feelings too. She's saying she isn't interested in the friend romantically/sexually. He either needs to trust her, or reevaluate if he wants to be in the relationship.\n\nOP, YTA for trying to control who your girlfriend hangs out with. You are allowed to feel insecure and should absolutely discuss it with your girlfriend in a mature, calm manner without imposing toxic control over her life. \n\nAnd for everyone saying NTA - evaluate why jealousy should allow you to control your partners friendships.

And why would OP feel comfortable hanging out with that guy if he knows that guy is trying to get him to cheat on or leave his girlfriend?", "I don\u2019t understand the logic here. The girl is disrespecting OPs relationship by confessing her feelings. She is trying to literally steal his girlfriend and he is the bad guy for being uncomfortable with that?", "You\u2019re making this about being gay or straight and it\u2019s not. It\u2019s about the fact that this friend still hit on his girlfriend despite knowing she\u2019s in a relationship and crossed that line. This friend is also not a long term friend, they just met a few weeks ago. It\u2019s not unreasonable for OP to ask her to cut it off. Your partner\u2019s feelings are valid. Why would you go out of your way to make your partner feel uncomfortable?", "Um, yes if the roles were reversed it would still not be cool. This other person is being completely disrespectful to OP by brazenly hitting on someone who is taken. It\u2019s disrespectful of his GF to continue to hang out with her. If a gay friend of mine started hitting on me, knowing full well I\u2019m taken you better believe that would be the end of the friendship. It\u2019s not about distrust it\u2019s about disrespect.", "18 she 20", "He says she\u2019s a homewrecker.

It sounds like the gf has no interest in cutting off this friend, as OP wants. If it\u2019s that much of a dealbreaker for OP, he should just end the relationship, because continuing to nag his gf about it clearly isn\u2019t changing anything.", "I think you\u2019re glossing over the fact that this girl told OP\u2019s girlfriend that she has a crush on her. You don\u2019t do that to someone in a relationship unless you\u2019re trying to get them to cheat on their partner with you or get them to leave their partner for you altogether. The fact that OP\u2019s gf was okay with that and is hanging out with her in secret is extremely suspicious.", "I respect your opinion and see where you come from but it not so much about sexuality but that she hides that they hang out from me", "Like I said it's not so much the interest it's the hidden hang outs", "It's not so much about the cheating I try and keep a complete trust with her even tho I have a past of being cheated on its the fact that she is hiding things and also that she tells me she will stop and doesn't and also the friend has a bad history", "The thing is she never said no she says she will and doesnt", "I didn't necessarily tell her she asked me if I wanted her to and I said yes. Also I'm not uncomfortable becuase the other girl is bi so don't assume. The history is that she is a homewrecker and messes with others emotions.", "I thank you for your feedback. But the thing is ik i said I told her to cut her off but that was only after 4 conversation of her saying that she will cut her off. I told her during these conversations that if the other girl really makes her happy that should stay friends and she tells me she will cut her off anyways. Ultimately she doesn't cut her off. I am okay with her hanging out with anyone she has told me when she wanted to hang out with male friends that she used to like and they used to like her. The only problem I have had with her was that this girl has past of home wrecking the girl is a known liar", "Thank you for your feedback. Ik I try to just let it go but it keeps bothering me I tell her that it's the general situation that makes me upset then she wants me to explain everything. She keeps asking me to explain and I think trust is big in relationship so I'm not gonna lie about what is wrong ya know? I even told her just to give me a lil more time to process and get over it since this situation is still kinda a fresh wound.", "I agree I told her that ultimately I'll try and be ok with her either way. Though if she ultimately chooses to stay friends she can not expect me to get over it instantly.", "Him not wanting his gf to hang out with someone who has admitted interest in her isnt controlling its a boundary that should be respected, with that said they arent compatible imo so he should leave her", "therefore ESH. His girlfriend also hid the fact that she hangout with her.", "Oh I would not be happy about it, he just do not have the right to tell her to cut her friend of. He can ask, but that's it. It is that little detail that makes the difrence.", "There are different degrees of having a crush, though. This girl could have said something relatively harmless like \u201cyou\u2019re totally my type on paper\u201d or \u201cI had a huge crush on you back when we first met\u201d or \u201cobviously nothing\u2019s going to come of this, but full disclosure: I would definitely date you if you weren\u2019t straight.\u201d\n\nReplies like this are acting like she said \u201cleave your terrible boyfriend for me right now\u201d or \u201cI am completely in love with you.\u201d", "I think many YTA commenters are caught up or distracted by thinking OP is attacking the friend for being bisexual - which isn't how I interpreted the post at all.", "Im gonna agree with this. It's not okay to express romantic interest in someone who is in a relationship regardless of sexuality. At least from my perspective, if you have feelings for someone who is in a relationship, the best thing you can do is keep those feelings to yourself and be a friend thats there for them.", "Someone admitting they have a crush on you isn't the same thing as trying to get you to cheat on or leave your significant other. Nothing OP said indicates that the latter is happening.", "I feel like if the person was straight then it kind of becomes \u2018safe\u2019 to say it in a way.  Like I\u2019m not necessarily saying that\u2019s a great thing to do to someone but idk some people might have friendships like that.  Like if you\u2019re straight and the other person is gay how are they going to try to get you to cheat on someone?  They can\u2019t turn you gay.", "I mean I see your point, but ultimately this isn't a terribly unique situation. What about people who still have friendships with their exes? There is clearly an attraction there too. Now this is a red flag for some but isn't necessarily a dealbreaker for everyone. What about people who are friends that have a crush on each other but don't say anything? The only difference here is OP's SO can be ready to turn down any advances because she knows her friend is attracted to her.", "Yeah, I think a lot of people just aren\u2019t getting this because they are immediately associating OP\u2019s tone with controlling behavior. I\u2019m curious to see how this would go if the genders were reversed.", "Because the gf is property to be stolen? The gf has no agency of her own? The bf isn't being controlling and insecure?", "No, he's the bad guy for telling his girlfriend who she can't hang out with and expecting her to obey him. He can make his feeling known, but that's it.", "No, not at all. He is TA for trying to stop his gf from hanhin out with her.", "Then YTA. I really thought you were much younger. Stop treating your gf like property. She is not obligated to get your approval every time she hangs out with someone. Your gf says she's straight. If you can't trust her, break up, but stop trying to police her friendships. And work on yourself to become less needy and insecure rather than expect your gf to stop having friends you don't approve of. And saying the friend \"has a history\" makes me think you should take some time getting to know women as humans rather than trying to manage their actions to quell your insecurities.", "He is putting a looooot of details in the comments that really should be added to the main post. \nThe GF lying about it? That\u2019s where the line is for me. \n\nI don\u2019t think he\u2019s an asshole. I\u2019m gonna edit my comment.", "Ya it is because it takes two to tango", "Or the gf is completely straight and has no interest in her friend and she didn't tell him because she is tired of his intense nagging to dump said friend.", "You gloss over the fact that OP is straight and pretty secure in her sexual orientation. \n\nOr are you saying the gf is in the closet, confused about her sexuality?", "It doesn't sound like you're attacking the friend for being  bisexual. I'm guessing you wouldn't appreciate your gf hanging out with a straight guy that told her he liked her either.\n\nThe problem is someone professed more than friendship feelings for your gf and they hang out and hide it from you. I think your discomfort is completely reasonable and not a slight against the LGBTQ community.", "Shes hiding that theyre hanging out because you are trying to force her to not spend time with someone she enjoys spending time with.  Your controlling attitude is pushing her to lie and keep secrets from you", "She is hiding it because she doesn\u2019t want to deal with arguing with you about it.", "yeah i understand thats def not cool, i think i misread sorry! hope everything works out for you!", "Except that you already had a problem with it before she started hiding the hangouts\u2026 so it is absolutely about the fact that this girl is bi and said she has a crush and you are insecure. If you weren\u2019t insecure you would simply inform your gf that you have heard that this person isn\u2019t very nice so be careful, and then leave your gf to make the decision herself. You immediately went to forbidding her from talking to this girl. You\u2019re lucky she just hid the hang outs and didn\u2019t break up with you for being controlling.", "Yeah, I definitely agree that it\u2019s really hard to establish trust when she saying she\u2019s going to stop and then you find out she\u2019s still hanging out with her. If she\u2019s gonna keep hanging out with her, she should just tell you. Hey, I don\u2019t wanna cut off my friend. \n\nIt\u2019s not cool that she\u2019s lying to you. That breeds distrust. \n\nAgain, if I was you, I would just have an open conversation with her. I don\u2019t know what the friends bad history is, but bring that up and how that\u2019s what concerns you.  Make it clear that you aren\u2019t worried about her cheating on you with this girl but that you\u2019re concerned because of the bad history, this girl has.\n\nIf, after the conversation, she still wants to be friends with her than she needs to be honest about that. It is her choice to continue hanging out with that friend. Even if you think it\u2019s a bad idea. What is it? OK is the lying about it. I think, as long as she can be honest about the fact that she\u2019s hanging out with her then you need to let your girlfriend have an experience in having a bad friendship. Lol I know that last part sounds a little bit harsh but there\u2019s no way around it. \n\nPersonally, my boyfriend has told me someone is bad news. I chose to still hang out with them with them and I got burned. My boyfriend didn\u2019t say I told you so, but trust me in the future l took his advice on his viewpoint of my friends more seriously. But I tend to want to be nice to everybody sooooooo lol", "That\u2019s not what your post says, lol.", "\"AITA for telling gf to cut off friend?\"  \nand check this out, watch me say she has a history without saying she's bi.  \n\"That girl has a history.\"  \n\n\nSee how I didn't include the other part?  Do you see how you did?  It's not an assumption, bud, it's... um... reading.  I did reading.  If it didn't matter that she was bi, you... probably wouldn't have mentioned it.  \n\n\nIf you don't want people to \"assume\" you're bi-phobic, maybe don't write things that sound pretty bi-phobic.  Then people won't \"assume\" anything.   \n\n\nEVEN if all of what you've said is true, YTA anyways because you don't trust your partner, because your feelings are the most important, because you want some say in who she hangs out with.  Those are all bad qualities.", "This still comes down to you not trusting your gf. Whether she\u2019s a home wrecker or not shouldnt matter. If your gf is trustworthy she is trustworthy no matter who she is interacting with. If she\u2019s not trustworthy, why are you with her? If you don\u2019t trust her to not get taken by this girl, you leave. You don\u2019t force her into compliance so she has no option but to stay with you.", "Here's the thing, she KNOWS you are uncomfortable, she KNOWS the girl wants her, so what does she do, sees her behind your back.

I hope she gets you are looking out for her.", "Especially such a new friend.

This person is trouble.", "I mean, he very obviously doesn't trust her so yeah, they should break up.", "\"I would definitely date you if you weren't straight\", would still be a really odd thing to say considering OP's gf is currently in a relationship. It isn't about the sexual orientation but the fact that the gf is already dating someone else.\n\nWhat was the end goal of telling the gf that anyway? If the gf were single I'd understand the \"I'd date you if you weren't straight\" comment. But to put that out there to someone in a relationship is nonsensical and uncomfortable.", "Yeah, me neither. I think some people on Reddit are too quick to assume bigotry in situations like this.

Like there's two reasons to tell someone in a relationship about your feelings for them: one, to explain why you need to start/maintain a distance between you and two, to try \"win them over\" aka start an affair or break up someone's relationship. One of those just barely toes the acceptability line and the other is being a total asshole.", "Exactly this!", ">It's not okay to express romantic interest in someone who is in a relationship regardless of sexuality\n\nUmmm, no. People do this all the time, and if someone is not fully happy in their relationship, who knows?\n\nThat said, after the first rejection, the proper thing to do is drop the matter.", "I don\u2019t think that\u2019s really comparable, though.

He said in his post that his first time bringing it up he already said he didn\u2019t want her talking to her. I get that she didn\u2019t stand up and say no and then hid it, but the behaviour was controlling from the get go. We don\u2019t know if she\u2019s hiding it because he has a history of being jealous in the past or what and he\u2019s only giving additional details when he\u2019s trying to backtrack. If that was the case all along, why not make it clear from the beginning?  My opinion is ESH.
