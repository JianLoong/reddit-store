I can\u2019t really fathom calling anyone in your situation \u201cinconsiderate\u201d. You are experiencing pain, loss, and a cavalcade of even more complicated things my dumb, male brain will never understand. You have the right to recover from that on your terms. What\u2019s inconsiderate is your husband prioritizing his fears and need for control over your need to take care of yourself.", "NTA Wanting time alone is healthy. You are two different people who happen to love each other, that doesn't mean you need him by your side 24/7.", "NTA. I travel without my husband a lot and he doesn\u2019t mind at all. Do what you need for you!", "NTA", "NTA for wanting to take time for yourself after such a traumatic event.\n\nThat said, husband is also suffering emotionally, this baby was his too.\n\nMaybe consider a compromise - you go for a few days on your own and then let him join you", "NAH. You have my condolences.\nEveryone grieves in their own way and I\u2019m sure your husband is grieving, too. That\u2019s probably why he\u2019s so worried about you being on your own. Maybe he\u2019s not comfortable being on his own at the moment?\n\n I see other comments suggesting a compromise and agree that\u2019s a good solution. That way you\u2019ll have time to find yourself again and be on your own. Later, your husband can join you for a bit and you can just enjoy your trip together. \n\nThis is how my spouse and I usually travel, too, because we became too dependent on each other after marriage. So I\u2019ll have \u201cmy\u201d trip, then \u201cour\u201d trip. I\u2019ll return home and he has \u201chis\u201d trip.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I don't know the right answer to this at all.  Good luck deciding what to do.", "nta\n\ni\u2019m so sorry for your loss but i think that you should keep in mind that your husband had also lost something as well. as a woman i do understand that this took a mental and physical toll on you because i bet your hormones are everywhere right now. everyone grieves in their own way and if this is how you want to cope then you should do it but do keep in mind that he might be trying to cope too. \n\n\nsorry for your loss again", "NAH, your husband also lost a baby and he is watching the person he loves most in this world suffer and he cannot do anything. I think you may need some therapy to deal with your grief.", "NAH - You should be allowed to do the things you need to grieve and get your head right. Just don\u2019t forget about his loss and emotional trauma he may be going through also. \n\nMy opinion\u2026 Take your trip. Just don\u2019t forget to call.", "NTA at all. But are you considering the fact that he's also going through something terrible? Like I understand that this is mostly about you, and you are the one who went through everything physically and hormonally. But he went through something really hard and I can see how he would think that you are abandoning him during a time when you should be supporting one another. Like are you asking him about how he's feeling and doing or what he needs at all? Your post doesn't make it sound like you've considered him other than how he's impacting you.", "NTA: it's completely okay for you to have some alone time especially at a sensitive time like you're having.\n\nI think as long as you communicate what you're feeling and thinking to your husband so that you both are on the same page, you've done what's required before being away from him for a while. He probably wants what's best for you, and it's entirely possible that one or neither of you know what 'best' is in this situation. Just because you don't agree with what your husband thinks didn't make you asshole.", "NTA but he's probably worried because you are in a bad place.  He doesn't want you to be alone.", "SO NTA!!! Please take care of yourself and do what you must to heal! Your husband is being selfish and inconsiderate. My condolences for your loss \ud83e\udd7a\u2764\ufe0f", "NAH. He is rightfully concerned about you, but you know what you need.", "NTA.  First, I\u2019m so sorry to read about your misfortune.  We all need time to ourselves and he should respect that.  At the same time, while his body did not have a miscarriage, he also lost a baby.  How does he feel about it?  Maybe he is also grieving in his own way?", "NAH. You've been through something traumatic and are obviously looking for an out - but this may not be the way. I understand your husband's concern and to be honest, I'd be very worried if I was in his position too. It seems as though you're in a fragile mind set and going off by yourself might not be the best idea.\n\nWhat else have you tried as far as therapy/counselling is concerned? Think about how much healing you really think you could achieve by going away by yourself. Would you go back to your husband a healed person or would you two be apart for a week with your husband in a state of worry for no healing gain?", "I can imagine he's not okay with it really and is worried given your mental and physical state right now. NAH because feeling how you do is understandable and his reaction is as well. He knows you're hurting and is probably pretty scared for you right now as well and wants to do whatever he can to watch over you", "NAH. I\u2019ve had a miscarriage and it was incredibly traumatic. While it took sometime to really consider my husband, he lost a baby too. Just because your husband didn\u2019t have the physical trauma doesn\u2019t meant he didn\u2019t have the emotional. He definitely wants to take care you, but he might need you to help take care of him too. \n\nThat said, I totally understand wanting the time alone. Maybe there\u2019s a way you can plan the trip and front load him on wanting to have that time to yourself as well. A lot of marriages don\u2019t survive things like this and while it feels like just your to grieve and you need that time to make a choice, also consider it may have long term effects on you healing together or separately. \n\nAnyway, I am so, so sorry for your loss. I wasn\u2019t sure I would survive the journey to the other side\u2014 it won\u2019t go away but I promise you it will get better. Process, grieve, heal however you need to survive. Just remember your husband is doing the same. \ud83e\udd0d", "NAH.  My wife has had a number of miscarriages throughout our 35 years of marriage. When they happened,  my job was to stay strong and give her whatever support she needed.   It was her body that was impacted.   She had to deal with the chemical imbalances.   She was the one who felt the loss of life.  My role was to help her get through all this. \n\nBut I had also lost a child.   One that I never got to know. Granted,  I was not impacted anywhere close to how she was.   I am not even trying to compare.  But the loss was still there. \n\nYou need to do what you need to do to recover.  Both emotionally and physically.   That is certainly your priority.   But keep this in mind as you make your decisions.", "Pat on the back to OPs husband for being worried about her being alone and wanting to be around to care for her, but bottom line- you NEVER should need to feel guilty for needing to take time to yourself. As long as you are safe with yourself, then having this kind of alone time to feel like your own person is important for your relationships. NTA", "I am so sorry for your loss. There are NAH. You both are grieving, and you both feel how you feel. Perhaps if you acknowledged that you know he is grieving, too, and you know he wants to take care of you, that might help? It\u2019s not that you want to be away from *him*\u2026you just need time to be alone. Best wishes to you both.", "This is exactly why I think he needs some time away from me too. Maybe hang out with his friends and do something different. \n\nHe doesn\u2019t go out much and I feel it\u2019s because of me.", "Not disagreeing with the judgement but please remember that husband also lost a baby. He won't ever know what a miscarriage feels like for a woman, nobody can claim that their pain is the same, but this is a bad time for them both.\n\nHe is not selfish for wanting to care for his wife.\n\nShe is not selfish for wanting to get away for her own healing.", "I think selfish and inconsiderate is a bit off the mark here. I think worried and caring fits a bit better.", "I don\u2019t know. I used to be a solo traveller before marriage and solo trips used to be healing at that time but it\u2019s been long since I have been alone. \n\nI really don\u2019t know what the outcome will be. But I just want to run away you know? And come back healthy and sound. Maybe it\u2019s my hormones but I can\u2019t shake this feeling off me.", "Hey OP. This isn\u2019t the time to be listing what your hubby needs. Tell him you love him. Go do some healing. And know that it\u2019s gonna take time.", "The term \"run away\" is of key concern here. Your problems will be waiting for you when you get back and nothing will have changed.\n\nIf you start the healing process with professional help as anyone who's been through what you have should, you may find you benefit a lot more from going awya for a week."]}
