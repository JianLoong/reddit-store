I also have a friend A(25f)\n\nMy gfs birthday recently passed, on September 24th. I know she loves things like scavenger hunts and jewelry so I set up a scavenger hunt for her in her apartment, with small pieces of gold jewelry at each location she had to find. Everything went smoothly and she ultimately loved her birthday. Here\u2019s where the issue comes in, my gf was excited to tell her friends about it, and they mostly found it to be cute but also were wondering how I could afford all this jewelry. This is when I told them that my friend A had made all of it, since it\u2019s a hobby of hers to make jewelry.\n\nWell my gfs friends didn\u2019t appreciate that very much. They all started blowing up on me and shouting that I shouldn\u2019t be having another girl \u201cmeddling\u201d in my relationship. I don\u2019t believe that this is what\u2019s happening.\n\nYes, A is my best friend and I know how that seems like a bad thing but we\u2019re honestly only friends. A and I have known each other since we were a few months old, and we\u2019ve never looked at or touched each other in any way other than a friendly way.\n\nMy gf is conflicted as of right now and won\u2019t let me anywhere near her. She\u2019s told me already that she\u2019s selling the jewelry since it no longer brings her happiness. I can see how it would upset her that another girl made the jewelry but I thought it would upset her more if I lied so now I\u2019m conflicted as well. AITA?\n\nUpdate: My now ex texted me a little while ago. She cheated. We\u2019re breaking up.

You did not get another woman to insert themselves into your relationship. Your girlfriend just can\u2019t accept that you have a friend who is a girl who helped. It\u2019s screaming red flags to me about her insecurity and she\u2019s using the gift selling to try punish you and hurt you.", "NTA. That reaction by the gf and friends literally had me saying \u201cwat\u201d out loud.", "NTA. No, I don't get the upset at all. Someone would have made the jewelry - they don't just spring from the ground. What's the big deal with buying it at lower cost from someone you know who makes jewelry? \n\nIf she doesn't like the personal gift, she should return it, not sell it off. Honestly sounds like it was fine with her until her friends started harping about you having a female friend at all and anywhere near \"involvement\" in the gift (and it's not like she selected the gifts, she is your crafts person). \n\nDo you want to be with someone acting as shallowly as your gf is acting now? \"Not letting you anywhere near her\" - does this mean you two would never be able to talk about conflicts? That's a lousy base for a relationship.", "Walk away from her cos she is easily influenced by grouping, don\u2019t allowed yourself to get scoured for doing no wrong", "NTA. The only people who shouldn't be meddling in your relationship right now are your girlfriends friends. Way to twist stuff. And your girlfriend shouldn't be more trusting of you. Does she not know your best friend? Also if she doesn't want the jewelry she should return it... selling it and making money out of it is just lol.", "NTA A helped you make your girlfriend happy. Hardly the move of someone who wants her out. I simply don\u2019t understand how your girlfriend can be upset by this. I think you did something really great and creative for your girlfriends birthday and you got a little help from a friend to make it happen on your budget. I don\u2019t see how it changes anything that your friend is female. The whole thing makes no sense to me.", "NTA. It kinda seems like your girlfriend didn't have any problems until her friends made it a big deal", "NTA - So this professional jeweller who happens to be your friend; hence you got mate\u2019s rates made jewellery for your GF\u2019s birthday and she doesn\u2019t want you to be friends with her\u2026 for what reason?\n\nAre you allowed to buy things from other women? Are you allowed to go to the shops by yourself?!", "NTA \n\nA is your best friend, you've known her forever. \n\n\nHas this never come up? Mentioning A as your best friend? Them meeting each other?\n\n\nBut unless A shits gold, you still paid for gold to make multiple pieces of jewelry, how did that make it so you could afford it?", "100% NTA.  You are allowed to have friends of the same gender as your SO and this reaction is heartbreaking. Gf and her friends are ahs.", "Nta i would break up with her. A is by all intents and purpose a jewelry maker you happen to know. She\u2019s being incredibly ridiculous saying that the GOLD JEWELRY she was so fond of suddenly brings no joy because a woman you happen to know made it. And her friends suck ass too. Why waste time on petty silly games with someone that just changes her mind on a while because of her friends frankly stupid criticism? Does she have no opinion of her own?", "When I first read the title my thoughts were: did OP steal them?\n\nOf course you're NTA for getting the jewelry from your friend.\n\nThe \"Iranian\" jewelry is not the issue here. I have some sympathy for GF's insecurities, but that's something she'll have to sort out. People having other friends that aren't competitors is a fact of life.\n\nHer friends sound awful.", "The fact that this is even a post that exists is dumb in itself.\n\n**NTA** so much so that this post shouldn't exist. You and A are friends. What more does she want? It makes no sense for her to be upset about it unless she's either: Very material, and is sad that you didn't spend far much more money on it. Or she's jealous of your friend, which I assume she knew about already since you've been together for 9 months?\n\nNTA and never will be, no matter how you twist and turn this. You clearly put effort into a scavenger hunt with \"prizes\" she liked. Her being less excited about them now that she knows it comes from A puts suspicion on her. I can't tell what kind, though.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.
