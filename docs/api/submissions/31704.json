So Thanksgiving afternoon I'm having Thanksgiving at my sisters house and heading out the door and I go out to my garage where I keep my manual chair and I see my neighbors son and his friend playing in my wheelchair and being very rough with (they were both riding on it and they tipped over backwards) I was angry and yelling at them that my wheelchair wasn't a toy and that I needed it and they just laughed and continued playing with it. So several minutes go by of me trying to get them to stop playing in my wheelchair they were in their backyard that I can't get to so I try calling their parents to try and help but they don't answer so I have to go all the way around the block to get to the front of my neighbors house. When I get to the front of my neighbors house and I'm finally able to tell them the situation my neighbors say it isn't a big deal and I shouldn't be so angry but by this time it's been several minutes and I'm supposed to be at my sisters house with food and I inform my neighbors that I need my wheelchair to go to my sisters. I finally got my manual chair and I tell my neighbor I'm going to call the police next time and my neighbor said I was being a sensitive A hole but I don't think I am.

They trespassed, and then *stole* your wheelchair?? Little shits. File a police report now.", "NTA. Wheelchairs are not toys. And, even besides that, it didn't belong to the kids, and they should not have been on your items, and on your property, to begin with. You would have been 100% justified in calling the police on them. The whole \"you are being too sensitive\" is the usual fallback of people doing wrong when called on their behavior in order to try to turn blame round on the other person.", "NTA, time to get security cameras.", "What the actual fuck? How did they get the chair in the first place? This is so wrong! NTA call the police and see if you can still file a report and get something so the parents see how serious it is! Not a joke!", "You don't have to csll the police next time.\n\nYOU HAVE TO CALL THE POLICE RIGHT NOW!", "NTA.  I would have been horrified, if it had been my children.", "You should have called the police on the little trespassers the minute the parents indicated they didn\u2019t GAF what their spawn were doing in *your* garage. \n\nI hope the garage has a lock. And maybe get a security camera or two. \n\nNTA, your wheelchair isn\u2019t a *toy*.", "Also I should add the kid playing with my chair is almost 13 so not that young.", "NTA\n\nThose parents don\u2019t GAF, and it would seem from the comments that the kids have in fact damaged the wheelchair. Who knows how many times they have abused the chair.\n\nCall the police now, don\u2019t wait for a next time. From what I know, wheelchairs are not inexpensive, and if they should break the wheelchair the next time, you don\u2019t know that those parents have the means to replace it.\n\nGet a lock put on your garage to be sure, but just in case there\u2019s a next time make sure that you\u2019re calling the police this time. Whatever repairs are needed for the wheelchair, it\u2019s likely going to be easier  to hold them responsible for repairs as opposed to replacing the chair.\n\nIt would be amazing if those kids could be made to pay for the repairs, as it might teach them a valuable lesson.", "Are you kidding? NTA.\n\nIt is not you should not have \"been\" so angry. It is that this should not have reached the point where you even had to \"get\" this angry.\n\nMost kids when they get \"caught\" doing something by a neighbor get the heck out of there, and it's a nuisance\\*. I believe your neighbors children ignored you because you do not present a physical threat to them or did not have the physical ability to retrieve the wheelchair from them. For this reason, I do not believe calling the police is escalating things unreasonably. Their parents should, 100%, have intervened, like it or not.\n\n\\*: Edit: I know this misses half the point, I agree with the other commenters that this was already a police matter when you noticed they were damaging your wheelchair. But it's still not what disturbs me the most.", "NTA, I can't believe this behavior...", "NTA.\n\nShitty parents often raise shitty kids. You have every right on earth--and then some--to escalate this situation.\n\nThese folks need to learn the word \"consequences.\"", "NTA. I am sick to DEATH about the entitlement of people these days. It's sickening. In my day, we would've gotten our asses beat for doing something like this, and rightfully so. I'll save all the entitled people the trouble, \"ok boomer\". Call me that all you want, but this society has gone so downhill since I was young, and no one wants to see what the problem is.", "NTA. Those kids are irresponsible because their parents are also irresponsible. Yes, it is a big deal. This chair is necessary for your transportation. It is the same as if they were joyriding in someone's car.", "NTA for yelling at them, but frankly Y-T-A to yourself for not calling the police now. They trespassed, damaged your wheelchair, and their parents don't care.\n\nThis WILL continue to occur.\n\nGet security cameras and file a police report.

NTA.", "Tempting, also I guess I'll start locking my garage. I thought Iived in a safe neighborhood.", "Its partially my fault I went out earlier and took my manual chair out of the garage and went back in the house to finish making food to take to my sisters and just left my wheelchair under the awning between my house and garage but there is a little fence that separates my driveway to the awning area and the kids had to have jumped over the small fence I keep locked and lifted the chair over, it doesnt weigh much like less than 50lbs so two 12 year old kids could easily lift it over the fence.", "I'm starting to think I should.", "Yes the father has too much of a I don't care about anything attitude its annoying.", "Defo file a police report, that\u2019s too old to f around and not find out.", "I would agree and what's messed up is that just last week I was smoking a brisket for my neighbor and making sides when the wife was in the hospital and the father doesn't much except basic stuff. Thankfully I think my insurance will cover repairs they did in the past when a car accidentally bumped into me while I was crossing the street and they weren't watching where they were going.", "I 100% agree, the kids ignoring me is what made me even more angry about the situation.", "Agreed.", "After filing a police report, take the chair in for repair, then make sure you give the parents the repair bill.
