Only interacting with the same like minded group going over the same material can be limiting and biased.

Most of my public school students have an average level.  Maybe they're a bit better at writing than math or vice versa, but it's typically relatively close.  My homeschooled students tend to be really, really good at some things and utterly terrible at others.  I've found that it is typically the things they enjoyed or had a talent for that they're good at.  The parents wouldn't want to fight them on doing more than the absolute minimum (or less) in the area(s) they didn't like and let them do advanced study in the areas they did.  Or they're really good at the things their parents could help them with, but bad at the things that were their parents' weak areas.  This means they may be wildly knowledgeable in x, but absolutely atrocious at y.  In public school, while they can still choose whether to take advanced classes in specific areas, they have to do the basics even in areas they don't like and should (note the word choice) have had someone who knew how to teach that topic well."]}
