It was about whether I was an asshole for keeping my Dodgers gear up with the sole purpose of pissing off my Texan neighbors.\n\nIt didn't get much attention, but I'm back with an update.\n\nWe moved!  \n\nWe moved back to Los Angeles over the summer.  Things weren't as hard as my wife and I would have thought.  We looked around online and recruited our family and friends to what we called \"Operation: Get Out!\".  The objective as to find an affordable place to live and gtfo.  Given everything going on over there, we didn't want to raise our daughter in Texas.  Also all of our family and friends were in California, and we wanted her to know her grandparents.\n\nWith the help of my father-in-law, we bought a small house half-an-hour away from Los Angeles.  It's a fixer upper but my wife has been loving the renovation projects so far.  We just finished the kitchen and the nursery.  My wife can't wait to tackle the living area next year.  She loves getting to channel her inner Joanna Gaines.  I found a new job that lets me work from home a couple of days a week, so I can stay with our girl.  \n\nSpeaking of our girl, she hadn't been born when I made my post.  My wife and I took a \"babymoon\" trip to Mexico to enjoy our last vacation before she arrived.  Only Hannah decided that she didn't want to be born in Texas and crashed the trip!  I'm a little disappointed that we broke the cycle of the fifth generation born in Los Angeles.  But Hannah is a healthy, strong little girl and that's more important.  And we have an interesting story as to why our half-Asian daughter now has Mexican citizenship.\n\nThank you for confirming that I'm not an asshole.

Congrats!", "Glad you're back in California where you feel comfortable.  But, the Dodgers?  Oh, hell no.  Go Padres!!", "Lol Houston can still be so provincial for such a large city. But I\u2019ll go back to eat there every chance I get", "Fellow Angeleno here, welcome back home to the land of great weather, beautiful people, and sanity!\n\nBeen there, done that, I've never had the ahem \"pleasure\" of living in Texas, but been to Houston quite a few times on business and experienced their gun-totin' yee-haa citizenry, vast wasteland of \"scenery\" and 1000% humidity. For those who live there and love it, great for them, more power to ya  (although TBH while I've known plenty of people who lived there, none of them claimed to actually love it or even like it).  There is no amount of money that would get me to move there. Once when I just had to change planes in Houston I thought I was going to be sick.\n\nViva los Dodgers!", "I just read an article on a couple who moved to Austin and realized it was nothing as expected. Things were as expensive as California beyond the cheaper square footage. \n\nI visit Texas regularly and usually in July due to family reasons and I can tell you it's the one part of America I dislike a lot. Weather is obnoxiously hot so youre confined to indoor air-conditioned facilities. \n\nPeople are generally rude. You get the facade of southern hospitality, but really, they are all passed off people. Even my american wife is shocked when she first visited Texas. And I bring my stereotypical canadian sorry's and thank you's and usually people can't help but respond in kind. You smile and people respond with some sort of smile. Not in Texas.\n\nHaving visited California as well, I appreciated the laid back and gernally west coast attitude. Good decision on your part.", "Congratulations!", "I am a St. Louis Cardinals fan living on the outskirts of Chicago. There are quite a few of us here, and some are much more open and vocal than others. We also have the White Sox vs. the Cubs, the Bears vs. the Colts vs. the Packers for those who live across the state line in Indiana and Wisconsin, and college sports rivalries up the wazoo. 99% of the people all know it is both serious and in good fun.", "NTA even though I hate the Dodgers (Padres fan here). Welcome back to CA.", "NTA. Sports people this intense have a screw loose.", "Woo hoo!\n\nWelcome back to California, and congratulations on your baby girl!", "Aren\u2019t San Diego and LA only 2 hours apart? In New York and New Jersey there are tons of rival teams that play within a few miles of each other. Not a huge deal to wear a cap of another team. Unless you\u2019re purposely wearing it to antagonize someone and rub it in their face that their team lost or something, NTA", "I\u2019m most definitely not a Dodger\u2019s fan (I\u2019m in the Monterey Bay area, so by default I support the SF Giants), but I am wishing you a genuine \u201cWelcome Home\u201d! I\u2019m glad that you got to return to a good place. Congratulations on your new daughter, too!", "As a native San Diegan I feel this. But as someone who was an As fan (attending several thousand games over 35 years) until the new owners finally succeeded in trashing the fanbase so they could move the team to a smaller market and collect $$ from the league, I also say: Fuck the Trash-tros!\n\nGlad OP's daughter does not have to grow up in the Handmaid's Tale that is Texas today.", "I lived in Austin for a short time about 10 years ago. It wasn't ridiculously expensive at that time depending on where you lived. I'm sure it's much worse now as where I lived in East Austin was quickly being gentrified by all the hipsters who were slowly pushing out all of the minority families. All that said, Austin is the only place I've ever been in Texas where not all of the people were obnoxious and thought Texas and Texans were god's greatest gift to Earth. I absolutely hate Texas and would never live anywhere there again, but Austin is very much different than the rest of the state.", "Congratulations! The US will be improved when they build a border fence, not between Mexico and the US, but around Texas, which has my permission to secede from the union, right now.", "Congratulations on the move! Fuck the Astros.", "Honestly I find this hilarious. I\u2019m a native Montanan and literally every one hates Californians because of politics but people from Cali are some of the nicest people I\u2019ve ever met. Lately the hate on Cali up here has subsided because another state started being hated more\u2026 you probably guessed it. Texans. Straight fucking entitled assholes, we Montanans have NEVER met such entitled whackadoos. Just straight rude. Their I\u2019m better than everyone attitude gets old. Glad you were able to get back home. Literally just fuck Texas.", "As a fellow Californian (go Giants!) your original post is truly the most California thing I've ever read lol glad you and your family got to go home.", "LOL - congrats on leaving the world's largest insane asylum that is Texas. I suspect that sports wasn't the only thing you had difficulty in finding people you agreed with there.", "As Chavela Vargas once said \"Los mexicanos nacemos donde nos da la rechingada gana\"", "Oh you poor thing the correct answer is giants moron the city rules NorCal for life loser", "I love it! So glad you're back where you're happy!", "Going from one radical extreme to the other, boy that's a big change.  Keep your dodger stuff up if it's what you want.  Your house means you can decorate it anyway you want.  NTAH.", "I think you mean \u00a1Viva Los Doyers!", "That's amazing! \n\n\n\nHappy you and your family are doing well! \n\n\nViva la Mexico!", "Good for you!  I've been to Texas and I'm not a fan. They don't even know how to pronounce \"Houston\" correctly.  (It's \"How-ston.\" Yes, I'm from Manhattan, why do you ask?) Anyway, with the politics in that area, it's not a place to raise kids, especially a little girl. I have a friend who moved to North Carolina recently because it's cheaper than the NY metro area, and she says she's helping turn the state blue. Which is valid, I guess...but you still have to live there in the interim. It's a beautiful state, but again, the politics...ugh.", "Congratulations on having a daughter and move back to Los Angeles.\n\nI had a Phillies pennant on my wall in my dorm room the year they beat the Braves in the National League championship.  I wanted to put it on the outside of my door, but I went to college in NC and couldn't guarantee that some nutty Braves fan wouldn't destroy it.", "NTA But wearing a dodgers hat around Texans is one way to die early", "I love this update. You sound like a blast.", "All of our Chicano are obsessed too.  They\u2019ve been showering us with Mexico-theme baby stuff since we came back home.  Our daughter\u2019s godmother wants to throw her a Quinceanera when she turns fifteen.", "Screw both of them! Go Giants!!!", "You got the Texas is shit part right but the answer is giants death to the dodgers", "Fuck the Astros!  I was throwing around so many middle fingers when we were leaving the neighborhood for the last time.", "I grew up in California, then moved to Montana to spend 16 long years, and now I\u2019m in Las Vegas. I can honestly say that in California and Vegas I had/have friendly neighbors that make conversation at the mailbox, whereas Montana had the worst neighbors ever - if they even deigned to speak to you.", "They finally filled Colorado and started moving North. The real invasion from the South.", "Please let godmom throw that quince!!!!!!!", "I live in North Texas and all the California people moving here and paying cash way over asking have destroyed our housing market. Then they move to small towns and get annoyed we don\u2019t have entertainment like a city.", "Sounds like Montana\ud83e\udd72", "I lived in Bozeman, Belgrade, and Helena and it was the same in all 3. Missoula was the only place where I felt remotely welcome, and even that was touch and go.", "Growing up here is beautiful but it\u2019s radical. I\u2019m from havre and met my fianc\u00e9 at MSUN at the diesel program-he\u2019s from nevada. It\u2019s wild how how many people told me I\u2019ve turned my back on my state, if there\u2019s such thing as state racism Montana is definitely \u201cracist\u201d towards other states.", "*Sadly waves an Angels rally monkey.* It's a hard team to root for, but it's honest work. \n\nAt least you're out of Astro city now!", "Man, Trash-tros fans really do suck, eh? Glad it worked out for ya.", "As a part time Phillies fan, congrats on everything and fuck the Astros", "Congratulations oh your new little baby. Viva Los Doyers!", "Fixing everyone\u2019s typo to Los Doyers.", "Yeah you're an asshole. Not for the situation, but because you're a dodgers fan. Congrats though!", "Let me know when you make on eyeblech dumbass", "Sorry, no!  Go Giants!", "Amen.\n\nI wonder what would have happened if you changed your Dodgers gear to the Rangers?", "I lived in Montana for several years (Gallatin Valley) and despite my Californian pedigree,  most everyone was just as nice as could be...of course,  that might have been because I married into the valley and almost immediately started helping neighbors craft arguments against a proposed housing development that would have been a nightmarish burden on the water & sewer systems and on the schools that weren't prepared for a 20% increase in their student populations. The developers were also unwilling to address the traffic concerns.  \nI had already seen the same shit play out in several communities in California and could therefore offer some insight on where to push hardest.  It almost always comes down to \"Where will you get the water and what will you do with the waste?\"   Development is pretty much inevitable but the pace can be slowed and developers can be forced to mitigate some of the impact.", "Shoulda gone with it, then thrown batteries if any of them tried.", "As a fellow Manhattanite, I'm sorry. But I just can't agree. It's not \"house-ton.\" It's \"Hue-ston.\" Lol! Couldn't help myself on that one.", "But you do know that there are actual asian Mexicans... right? It's not really a novel concept.", "Congratulations on your new arrival and new home! I wish you and your family the best of luck and happiness x", "Dodger fan in Houston territory - NTA.\n\nGrown man throwing around middle fingers to the neighborhood? Yeah... still NTA. Fuck those bigoted cheats.\n\nThose Houstonites that are telling you to get over a blatant cheating scandal with significant evidence are probably ironically the same people that stormed the White House believing there was a blatant cheating scandal with no evidence."]}
