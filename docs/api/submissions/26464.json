It was about whether I was an asshole for keeping my Dodgers gear up with the sole purpose of pissing off my Texan neighbors.\n\nIt didn't get much attention, but I'm back with an update.\n\nWe moved!  \n\nWe moved back to Los Angeles over the summer.  Things weren't as hard as my wife and I would have thought.  We looked around online and recruited our family and friends to what we called \"Operation: Get Out!\".  The objective as to find an affordable place to live and gtfo.  Given everything going on over there, we didn't want to raise our daughter in Texas.  Also all of our family and friends were in California, and we wanted her to know her grandparents.\n\nWith the help of my father-in-law, we bought a small house half-an-hour away from Los Angeles.  It's a fixer upper but my wife has been loving the renovation projects so far.  We just finished the kitchen and the nursery.  My wife can't wait to tackle the living area next year.  She loves getting to channel her inner Joanna Gaines.  I found a new job that lets me work from home a couple of days a week, so I can stay with our girl.  \n\nSpeaking of our girl, she hadn't been born when I made my post.  My wife and I took a \"babymoon\" trip to Mexico to enjoy our last vacation before she arrived.  Only Hannah decided that she didn't want to be born in Texas and crashed the trip!  I'm a little disappointed that we broke the cycle of the fifth generation born in Los Angeles.  But Hannah is a healthy, strong little girl and that's more important.  And we have an interesting story as to why our half-Asian daughter now has Mexican citizenship.\n\nThank you for confirming that I'm not an asshole.

Congrats!", "Glad you're back in California where you feel comfortable.  But, the Dodgers?  Oh, hell no.  Go Padres!!", "Lol Houston can still be so provincial for such a large city. But I\u2019ll go back to eat there every chance I get", "Fellow Angeleno here, welcome back home to the land of great weather, beautiful people, and sanity!\n\nBeen there, done that, I've never had the ahem \"pleasure\" of living in Texas, but been to Houston quite a few times on business and experienced their gun-totin' yee-haa citizenry, vast wasteland of \"scenery\" and 1000% humidity. For those who live there and love it, great for them, more power to ya  (although TBH while I've known plenty of people who lived there, none of them claimed to actually love it or even like it).  There is no amount of money that would get me to move there. Once when I just had to change planes in Houston I thought I was going to be sick.\n\nViva los Dodgers!", "I just read an article on a couple who moved to Austin and realized it was nothing as expected. Things were as expensive as California beyond the cheaper square footage. \n\nI visit Texas regularly and usually in July due to family reasons and I can tell you it's the one part of America I dislike a lot. Weather is obnoxiously hot so youre confined to indoor air-conditioned facilities. \n\nPeople are generally rude. You get the facade of southern hospitality, but really, they are all passed off people. Even my american wife is shocked when she first visited Texas. And I bring my stereotypical canadian sorry's and thank you's and usually people can't help but respond in kind. You smile and people respond with some sort of smile. Not in Texas.\n\nHaving visited California as well, I appreciated the laid back and gernally west coast attitude. Good decision on your part.", "Congratulations!", "I am a St. Louis Cardinals fan living on the outskirts of Chicago. There are quite a few of us here, and some are much more open and vocal than others. We also have the White Sox vs. the Cubs, the Bears vs. the Colts vs. the Packers for those who live across the state line in Indiana and Wisconsin, and college sports rivalries up the wazoo. 99% of the people all know it is both serious and in good fun.", "NTA even though I hate the Dodgers (Padres fan here). Welcome back to CA.", "NTA. Sports people this intense have a screw loose.", "Woo hoo!\n\nWelcome back to California, and congratulations on your baby girl!", "Aren\u2019t San Diego and LA only 2 hours apart? In New York and New Jersey there are tons of rival teams that play within a few miles of each other. Not a huge deal to wear a cap of another team. Unless you\u2019re purposely wearing it to antagonize someone and rub it in their face that their team lost or something, NTA", "I\u2019m most definitely not a Dodger\u2019s fan (I\u2019m in the Monterey Bay area, so by default I support the SF Giants), but I am wishing you a genuine \u201cWelcome Home\u201d! I\u2019m glad that you got to return to a good place. Congratulations on your new daughter, too!", "As a native San Diegan I feel this. But as someone who was an As fan (attending several thousand games over 35 years) until the new owners finally succeeded in trashing the fanbase so they could move the team to a smaller market and collect $$ from the league, I also say: Fuck the Trash-tros!\n\nGlad OP's daughter does not have to grow up in the Handmaid's Tale that is Texas today.", "I lived in Austin for a short time about 10 years ago. It wasn't ridiculously expensive at that time depending on where you lived. I'm sure it's much worse now as where I lived in East Austin was quickly being gentrified by all the hipsters who were slowly pushing out all of the minority families. All that said, Austin is the only place I've ever been in Texas where not all of the people were obnoxious and thought Texas and Texans were god's greatest gift to Earth. I absolutely hate Texas and would never live anywhere there again, but Austin is very much different than the rest of the state."]}
