I wanted advice because I\u2019m a bit upset about this but I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m being selfish. My boyfriend\u2019s mother birthday is Jan 1st. I currently live with my boyfriend and our 3 year old dog.

Another kind of compromise you could suggest would be staying home one year and celebrating NYE with her the other. Either way, your BF can still call his mother right after midnight.\n\nEDIT: You might want to tell your BF that all of this wouldn't even be an issue, if his mom's birthday was any other day of the year. Any other day if the year he would just call/go over there some time during the day, so just because his mom's birthday happens to fall on a day where people are usually still awake at at each other's houses at midnight doesn't mean that such special behavior is required.", "OMG what a Mama's boy. He has the rest of the following day to hang out with her. NTA", "[deleted]", "NTA. But it is the choice of your BF. \n\nCould there be a compromise? Like spending NY together with your BF's mother?\n\nWhat is her opinion on this, is it important to her that her son is there at 12AM, or would it be okay for her if you visit her the next day?\n\nI had the same problem with my father and Christmas. I am from Germany, so we celebrate Christmas on the 24th December in the evening, but the 24th is also a regular business day. For me, that meant I had often to work half a day, then had a 5-hour drive to be at my father's place just in time for the Christmas dinner. Tow years ago I had car issues and arrived hours late, and he revealed to me, that he would prefer to celebrate Christmas with his GF and her family instead of preparing a big dinner hoping that I will be on time. \n\nI always thought that this tradition was very precious to him and vice versa. Since then, he spends Christmas with his GF without a big dinner and lots of preparation and I come to visit on the 25th, and we spend some nice and relaxed days.", "NTA for asking. But the decision is his. You're allowed to not like it, but it's his.\n\nAnd you've said he has had mommy issues in the past, could you elaborate? Cause his mother could also probably say that he has a needy girlfriend, no?", "It's kind of weird that he wants to be with his mother at midnight, unless that's a tradition that the two of them have. Still, New Year's Eve is more often reserved for significant others. Without knowing the full story about whether or not he usually spends that time with his mother, and if there's more to that, I'll just say NAH, but there's definitely a possibility of NTA.\n\nI think long-term, though, the two of you need to come to an understanding about New Year's Eve, because if he wants to leave you at home next year too, and every year after that, then that would be a problem.", "Going to wish your parent happy birthday at midnight is weird. But making this big of a deal over NYE is just as weird. NAH or possibly ESH depending on how you both handle it.", "You're the asshole if you insist that your view is obviously correct and he's wrong to see things otherwise. Partners help partners love and take care of family, even difficult family, and it's often not clear what's best to do. This is a practice run, imagine one day she's your mother in law and needs to come live with you. Give him some space to work this out and be prepared to compromise. It's just a New Years, one boring one won't kill you.", "INFO.  Does he traditionally spend NYE with her so that he can wish her happy birthday at midnight?  If this an important tradition to them?", "Is there something special about it, or some kind of tradition? Is she a single mom? What are the details? Is this super important to him? Because if this tradition is really important, then this will continue on every year, and you either have to find a compromise or just accept this as your reality.", "INFO: It sounds like he was willing to be with you and to invite you to come to his mother's house. Is there a reason that he can't go on January 1st instead of New Year's Eve?", "INFO: If her birthday is on Jan 1st, why doesn\u2019t he just take her to lunch/dinner NYD or celebrate with her on her actual birthday? Why does he need to be with her at midnight? *Would he still do that if her birthday was any other day of the year?* Also, why aren\u2019t you invited to be a part of celebrating *with* him and her?\n\nImo he can always call her at midnight and then celebrate in person the next day. Her birthday is NYD, not NYE, so I don\u2019t understand why he thinks celebrating NYE with you is leaving her \u201calone\u201d on her birthday.", "I'm going to assume you've been dating for a while, since this doesn't sound like your first NYs together. \n\nYou need to have a talk with him and find out where you rank with his mother, because this is a sign that he will always choose her over you. This is basically a vision of your future. If you get married and have a disagreement with MIL he'll side with her. Difference of opinion on how to keep house, finances, child rearing, he'll side with her. \n\nNo one seems to have pointed out to him or her that as a parent, once your child is old enough they leave to have their own life. Parents don't sacrifice all of their time for their children  in order to get it back as adults. They do it so that their kids can have children to sacrifice all of their time for. It's a pay it forward situation and not a pay it back one. Those who go child free are just ending the cycle.\n\nJust because she raised him doesn't mean he owes her his life and this needs to be pointed out to him.\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nYep the whole mommy thing is kind of weird, gross and worrisome.  Ewww I know!, find a new guy!!! One that has cut the cord or pulled t7t out.", "He says he wants to say happy birthday to her at 12AM. And that he doesn\u2019t want to leave her alone which I dont understand if we could actually go next day and spend the entire day with her. But he still says he needs to think about it because it\u2019s such a difficult choice and he gets anxious about it.", "He\u2019s got mommy issues in the past :/", "Damn sorry. He\u2019s my boyfriend. I wrote it wrong. English is not even my first language, and I\u2019ve been doing extra hours today in my job. I\u2019m tired. I\u2019m human and make mistakes. Jeez, no need to attack me in such a way.", "I don\u2019t feel I\u2019m being needy for telling my boyfriend that his presence is important in New Year\u2019s. We have a home together. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s irrational or toxic for me to feel this way. It\u2019s not like I\u2019m telling him not to see his mother on her birthday. I even told him we go see her next day and plan something nice for her. He has dealt with feelings in the past of feeling responsible for her mother\u2019s well being when she\u2019s an adult already. He was looking out if she was eating healthy and right (just as how you do with a child, and she is an ADULT), he took her to the doc, he takes her to the mall, my boyfriend pay\u2019s for everything in his mother\u2019s house\u2026 and she\u2019s 59. Their relationship always made me feel weird but I\u2019ve always respected it. But I just feel upset for him thinking about leaving me alone in NYE.", "I answered some of those doubts, so you have more context", "Depends on how you\u2019ve celebrated NYE. I always used to celebrate with my family. Ever since I moved with my boyfriend or even before, he and my dog are my family. I don\u2019t feel there\u2019s something wrong with wanting to spend the first NYE in our home, together.", "I don\u2019t know about you, but living with a MIL is totally a dealbreaker for me. I\u2019ve always valued privacy, and I wouldn\u2019t handle that. And it\u2019s not just \u201cone boring night\u201d, so you\u2019re totally not getting it. I\u2019m not forcing him to stay, I just said I\u2019m upset, that\u2019s it. It\u2019s his choice to make.", "Is OP not compromising already by offering to spend NYE as a couple, and all of NY day with his mother? It seems to me that the BF is not willing to compromise if he\u2019s saying he HAS to go to his mom\u2019s at midnight.", "This is the first NYE outside of his house with his mother because we now live together. His mom is Jewish so she doesn\u2019t celebrate New Year\u2019s or Christmas that much. It\u2019s just my boyfriend feeling guilty for not being there for her at that time.", "Hi, please read my other responses. This is his first NYE outside of his mother\u2019s house. His mom is Jewish so she does not celebrate NYE or Christmas, he just feels guilty for not being there at that time. Yes she\u2019s a single mom, and my boyfriend has a younger brother who lives in there but he rather go with his dad around that time.", "Well, then you can expect to never get a NYE until she dies. I guess you need to decide how important NYE is to you.", "Honey, his mommy issues are absolutely not in the past. A grown up in a relationship wants to kiss their partner at midnight. Someone preferring to have that midnight kiss with mommy, has some issues.", "That is not the past. That is right now. This is super weird of him.", "Not one thing you have said means mommy issues, could be with something added to that, but just these? No. He is just a czring individual. \n\n(Not saying either nta or yta, just correcting her on this)", "There's nothing wrong with wanting it, there's something wrong with being upset because the other person wants something else.", "I don't think there really is or isn't an asshole, here. It's a setting expectations thing. If you really don't want it to be a thing that he goes to her, but it matters a lot to him, you either find a middle or one of you concedes. If you guys can't compromise, then this likely isn't the relationship for you.", "If she doesn\u2019t celebrate NYE, why is she even awake at 12:30am on 1/1?", "Maybe your husband and MIL need to be reminded of the Genesis passage that says,  \u201cTherefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh.\u201d I loved my mother dearly, but I never went to celebrate her birthday the night BEFORE. \n\n If he insists on going to mama's, he should  take you along (and smooch YOU at midnight). If that's a no-go, you should make plans of your own to go out on NYE.", "Wanna guess who he's gonna kiss at midnight?", "There\u2019s nothing wrong with being upset about your partner not having mutual feelings about connecting together for a holiday.", "She usually likes to stay up very late, everyday.", "Yeah, there is. Not everyone cares about the same holidays you do. Relationships are about give and take, compromise. If your SO is completely unwilling to *ever* follow your lead? Sure, that's appropriate to be upset about. But *one* time after celebrating your way in the past? Nope, it's not all about you.", "\u201cNot everyone cares about the same holidays you do\u201d\u2026 DUH. But your significant other should make an effort when you do care. Her boyfriend is picking his demanding mommy over his girlfriend. This never ends well.", ">But *one* time after celebrating your way in the past? Nope, it's not all about you."]}
