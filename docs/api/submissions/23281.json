Never would I let him drink from the human fountain, much less *lick the spout*. \n\nThat woman has to learn sooner or later. It's unhygienic; the person drinking from the fountain after is ingesting the dog's saliva (and dogs' mouths are *not* clean whatsoever). If she doesn't like the doggy bowl, sure.
