You might ask her to decide what\u2019s more important to her: saving your soul or judging you for your unbelief. She can pray for your soul, but her aggressive attempt to convert you is backfiring. Since she is a devout Christian, she should trust in God. Her actions are going to harden your heart. That would be a jujitsu way to call her out on her real behavior.

My ex MIL used to send me videos (VHS, it was a long time ago), magazines and books about \"How I found Jesus\" regularly, because she was embarrassed her son married an atheist, and I tried to be respectful about refusing them, but it was annoying and eventually made me angry that she couldn't, and wouldnt respect my clearly stated beliefs.

My mom was about ready to kill her brother\ud83d\ude02", "In a monotone chant: \"I request the spirits of food goodness to please bequeath our food with as much goodness as would reasonably fit within food of the size of the food we are about to devour in the company of those we love and/or tolerate for the sake of those we love. <Pause just long enough for people to assume you are finished> We ask the pantheon of punishment to please provide punishment to people who pillage proprietary pictures on the internet without seeking permission of the copyright holder and those who pick poses that are forbidden during sex and to generally avoid dealing with anyone here directly or if they must, to at least avoid picking inconvenient times for worldly punishments preparing peeps for the ploughing promised in the afterlife. Furthermore, we beseech the fire elementals from the elemental land of the fire elementals to reheat this food because it has lost some heat while we were making other reasonable requests to their colleagues. <Deep breath, pause again, then after some time just take a bite of the hottest thing on your plate.> Too much, fire elementals, that's too hot! We can't handle heat like you guys can!\"\n\n\"Hurry up and eat, guys! Before the spirits take back the goodness they've infused the food with! They always do, eventually. Oh and if you want to be official druids of the spirits, pantheons, elementals, and Avatar, the movie, the blue aliens one, not the live action version of the other Avatar, you just need to complete the ceremony by putting your thumb on your forehead and high fiving someone else who wishes to join. Yes, that means you can only join in pairs, unless you are in Paris, in which case that is waived. Actually, nevermind that, I'm going to start a new religion about the other Avatar. Not the live action movie, but the cartoon shows. I'm going to need to come up with a whole new set of prayers and ceremonies. Does anyone know where I can find a used hang glider? Preferably collapsible so I can fit it through doorways.\"\n\nYou might not get asked to say the prayer again, though. Unless your family is awesome, in which case you might be asked to say it more often. But they wouldn't have been pressuring you in the first place if they were.", "NTA but you should highlight and bookmark the most brutal, controversial parts of the bible like Timothy 2:12 (women should be silent in the presence of a man) and tell her you read through it and flagged what stood out to you lol.", "NTA. And that's ridiculous. She embarrassed herself. I mean, it's not like you said \"Good food, good meat, Good God let's eat!\" \n\nYou sat respectfully.", "One thing that I will forever be grateful for to my youth group leader at my church in high school was that, when I told her I wasn\u2019t sure what I believed anymore and I didn\u2019t feel comfortable praying for the group because it felt like lying to them, they respected that and never pushed me to participate in a way that I wasn\u2019t comfortable with.  They supported me in my journey to understand my faith, even when it became clear that I was leaning more towards agnosticism, because they cared about me and knew that trying to force me to do things would only push me further away.  I\u2019m sorry that your sister doesn\u2019t seem to understand that.  I think that your response to her suggesting you lead the prayer was extremely polite, considering what she was trying to do.  NTA.", "NTA", "I would\u2019ve placed the book outside her bedroom door with a note that said \u201cthanks but no thanks.\u201d And left it at that. NTA", "NTA\n\nBelief is a personal matter. She doesn\u2019t get to force anybody one way or another", "She purposely tried to screw you by asking you to start the prayer.", "Organized religion is not for me (baptized Catholic from my mom - Catholic turned Baptist and my dad who is Atheist (parents divorced long ago)). My mother always tells me I better get right with God, my child will go to hell because he's not baptized, tries to get me to say grace when we're together for a holiday meal. I just tell her it's ok, she can do it.\n\nWhenever I'm at anyone's house for a holiday and they want to pray, I'll lower my head, roll with whatever they are doing out of respect and it sounds like you did the same thing...just rolled with it. You didn't slam your fist on the table and swear or straight up tell your sister you aren't down with the BS, so I'm not seeing how you could have embarrassed her. \n\nNTA", "NTA- She was attempting to manipulate you into praying by putting you in the spot. She's the AH. She also sounds like the typical judgemental Christian who are the ones who unknowingly actually discourage a lot of people from religion.", "\"We give thanks for the achievement of Giordano Bruno, burnt at the stake by Christians for helping establish the existence of the Sun and planets as but one part of a vaster Universe.  We give thanks for the achievement of Isaac Newton, who showed that simple natural laws, and not the whims of god, drove the rhythms of the planets, stars, and galaxies.  We give thanks for Charles Darwin, who demonstrated the continuity of human life with that of all the Earth's biology through the principle of natural selection.  We give thanks for Karl Marx, who showed that the structure of societies, and the classes that comprised it, arose from relations in the social organization of labor.  We give thanks for the long struggle of humanity to overcome backwardness, ignorance, and superstition, to set aside the petty gods of the infancy of human development for the richness of reason grounded in material law.  We will divide not over individual myths, but over the best scientific method to regulate climate, over competing tendencies in music, over the optimal design of factories that meet our needs while exercising stewardship over the planet.  Our approach will not respect the custody of special priestly castes, but be shared by humanity in common effort to elevate humankind.\"", "I'm an atheist too but, frankly, The Satanic Bible makes more sense than the Christian Bible.  If I had to pick one...", "My dad was similar with the church groups every day and reading of the bible.\n\nHe was also adamant that his religion was his and he wouldn't foist it on anyone else. He might be sad if we didn't follow his beliefs (simply because his beliefs said that this would be bad for us) but he would never try to force it.\n\nHis reasoning was that there's no point trying to force someone to believe. All you'll do is force them to lie and what's the point in that? Its not like you can trick god!\n\nits not disrespectful to ignore your dad's attempt to foist his religion on you. Its disrespectful of him to keep trying to foist his religion on you.", "> the humanity unchained\n\nlol like in Honor Harrington?", "Nobody reads the Bible cover to cover, ever. I had my Christian best friend shit bricks when I told him the first two chapters of the Bible contradicted each other. He immediately ran off and grabbed a Bible, then sat there for about ten minutes re-reading Genesis 1 and 2 over and over gain, before finally telling me the actual text doesn't matter, only the general meaning.\n\nThat conversation started because he boldly told everyone that Genesis accurately predicted everything that science has proven in the same order. He had no idea that the supposed order of creation he knew wasn't 100% what was actually in the Bible.\n\nIn my experience, the people who actually read the Bible in detail are always the ones who end up not being Christians. Its kinda scary how churches tend to avoid certain parts of the Bible and never discuss them.", "Well, it is difficult to rhyme with \u2018Manischewitz\u2019.", "Now that you said I\u2019m realizing the version we did, which was similar, never mentioned Jesus.", "NTA. Of course you could go for sarcasm\n\nRub-a-dub-dub thanks for the grub, let's eat.", "If it helps total Christian here and your not an AH your sister is. From your story you sounded very respectful and everything. Your sister knowing your beliefs should have never asked. I've been around other faiths and in situations similar I'll be respectful and bow my head or whatever the situation calls for and say a silent prayer myself or just sit quietly. In your situation when asked to lead prayer for something I didn't believe in I'd have done the exact samething you did for the same reason. Yes I could maybe \"go through the motions\" but that would seem disrespectful of their faith to me as well", "NTA.
