I hope you have somewhere else to go for thanksgiving next year because her behavior is awful.", "NTA. It may be good to speak with your sister about her behavior in private. You might ask her to decide what\u2019s more important to her: saving your soul or judging you for your unbelief. She can pray for your soul, but her aggressive attempt to convert you is backfiring. Since she is a devout Christian, she should trust in God. Her actions are going to harden your heart. That would be a jujitsu way to call her out on her real behavior.

Your sister was, trying to force you to lead the prayer when she knows you're an atheist-she showed no respect to your beliefs or feelings, and put her own feelings above those of her guests. As for leaving a bible in your room, that's just as bad. My ex MIL used to send me videos (VHS, it was a long time ago), magazines and books about \"How I found Jesus\" regularly, because she was embarrassed her son married an atheist, and I tried to be respectful about refusing them, but it was annoying and eventually made me angry that she couldn't, and wouldnt respect my clearly stated beliefs.

Your sister put you in an uncomfortable place because she\u2019s trying to force you to practice a religion you don\u2019t agree with.

Although I would say they are well intentioned, they are AH\u2019s for their methods. I\u2019m a practicing Christian, but if I were in a Hindu\u2019s house and they were asking me to do things I disagreed with, I\u2019d be bowing out just like you were today. I would have a conversation with your sister that you are an atheist, period, and you\u2019d appreciate it if she\u2019d stop the conversion techniques.

You took a part, you said what you were grateful for, you were polite. You sister is an AH here trying to provoke you. \n\nI'm not sure if I'm truly atheist, but I certainly steer clear of religions, I behave like you when spending Christmas with family and I don't think I'm an AH.
