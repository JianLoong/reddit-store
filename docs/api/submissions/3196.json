You might ask her to decide what\u2019s more important to her: saving your soul or judging you for your unbelief. She can pray for your soul, but her aggressive attempt to convert you is backfiring. Since she is a devout Christian, she should trust in God. Her actions are going to harden your heart. That would be a jujitsu way to call her out on her real behavior.

My ex MIL used to send me videos (VHS, it was a long time ago), magazines and books about \"How I found Jesus\" regularly, because she was embarrassed her son married an atheist, and I tried to be respectful about refusing them, but it was annoying and eventually made me angry that she couldn't, and wouldnt respect my clearly stated beliefs.
