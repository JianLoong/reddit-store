So the hell with her.\n\nNTA", "Not seeing how this is your problem at all.\n\nNTA", "There are professionals who specialize in cleaning out houses under these circumstances. It's easier for them, because there's no emotional component for them. You're NTA. Your family should have hired help.", "My MIL is a hoarder. We have done a few complete clean outs at her place. After the last time I told my In-laws that I will not do it again. While visiting she started talking about what to do with all her stuff \"garbage\" when she passes away. We all looked at each other and then my husband said \"we are not sorting or searching through anything, we are taking everything to the dump. How would we know if anything here has value when you treat it like trash.\" \n\nNTA, you are not responsible for the repercussions of years of untreated mental disorder.", "Part of me is on the fence, but I lean toward NTA, mostly because just because someone(s) are family, does NOT mean they have a right to you, your time, your money, or your energy.\n\nOther part of me says just go pitch in and help for a weekend. It's about your remaining family at this point, not grandma (she's dead and gone), so if you care about keeping solid relations when others are flying in, and you don't hate those people, helping out a couple days would probably be appreciated.", "NTA. You do not have any reason to help address this problem. They need to hire a company to help with this. Maintain your distance and enjoy your freedom from all of that.", "NTA.\n\nAs someone who had to clean out my MIL\u2019s hoarder house by myself, I think it\u2019s selfish to collect stuff for decades and then expect someone else to deal with it. Your family is likely hating the clean out process like I did, and wants everyone to suffer.", "Your grandma is dead, you not helping only hurts your alive family members. YTA.", "NTA.  They could have chosen to hire professional cleaners to help.", "YTA.  It\u2019s not like your grandmother is still here to benefit from the clean out, the only people being hurt by your refusal are your parents.", "YTA. Cleaning the house isn\u2019t for your grandma\u2019s benefit, it\u2019s for your parents\u2019. Stop rationalizing and start helping.", "YTA, you aren't hurting your grandma, you're hurting your parents.", "I know it sucks, but you should help for your mom's sake.", "YTA. Grow up sweet cheeks. Help your family", "YTA. She's dead. Get over the childhood trauma long enough to help clear her shit out.", "I'm going with NAH, but you should really lend a hand.  Make it a final F-U to her, if you need to.  Let her know you're going through all her shit, and there's not a damn thing she can do about it.", "YTA - this isn't for your grandma's benefit, it's to help your family get shit out of the house and be done with it.", "Yta. Gently though because this sounds like a challenging situation. Your grandma sounds like she was a shit potato but she\u2019s dead. You weren\u2019t close to your grandma so you\u2019re not particularly grief stricken, right? Go help your mom clean. You\u2019ll be in your grandmas house, trashing her \u201ctreasures\u201d and mentally giving her the middle finger the whole time. That sounds rather awesome.", "Just help.", "YTA - she\u2019s dead. Youre not helping your grandma, youd be  helping your other family.", "Y(a little bit)TA. I get it, but it\u2019s not grandma you\u2019re sticking it to, it\u2019s all your other family members who could do with the help. As for this bit about still having to deal with your grandma, that\u2019s happening either way - you help clean up her mess, or you get resented for not helping clean up her mess. Either way she\u2019s still causing you shit, and the second has the potential to last a lot longer. It\u2019s just whether you passively let her continue to affect you for as long as it takes other people to get rid of her, or actively work to help get rid of her yourself. I\u2019d help, and try to look at it as kind of an exorcism", "I get it but, as others had said, not helping doesn't impact your grandmother. Your grandmother is dead.\n\nThe only people impacted by you helping or not is your family.\n\nThat doesn't mean that going there may not be hard because you'll be surrounded by your grandmother's crap but you'll be getting to literally throw her away. Literally into the garbage.\n\nIf you can't do it. You can't do it.\n\nBut it feels like you should go and your BF should go with you to be supportive during the process but that it may help to firmly close the door on that chapter.\n\nNAH", "YTA, but not because you don\u2019t like your grandma. Your grandma is already dead. You not helping your mother clean is only hurting your mother, not your grandma. I assume your mom is in her 50s, so why won\u2019t you help her?", "YTA - at this point it's not about Gma at all or how she treated you, it's about being there for your mom and helping her. This is why your other family members are calling you selfish. \n\nYou're using Gma as a reason not to, but she's not here anymore, so how is helping your mom going to affect your mental health in a negative way? You really need to think this through.", "ESH", "YTA, because you wouldn't be doing this for your grandma and not helping won't affect her at all. It *is* affecting the rest of your family, who you don't seem to have a problem with.\n\nBy helping, you would be helping the rest of your family. Grandma is irrelevant.", "YTA \n\nGrandma is dead and gone. This is about all hands on deck, helping your Mom to get the shit done. If you don't want to help, fine, your choice. But don't use your relationship with granny be an excuse.", "YTA - just pitch in and help out. Is it worth this much stress and drama? You\u2019re being petty. Like others have said, this isn\u2019t about helping your dead gma but showing support for your family (who are all obviously grieving at the same time too). \n\nWith that being said, you can specify how much you can help out or how you can help out. If it\u2019s a week long venture cleaning out granny\u2019s house, commit to a day or 2.  Or offer to be the one that does dump runs or donation runs. Offer to be the one that brings breakfast and lunch to your family members at the house\u2026.the list is endless. But the important thing here is that you\u2019re supporting your (alive) family members. \n\nIf you have ongoing trauma from you gma being a shitty person to you, talking to someone (therapy) might be a good thing for you in the long run.", "YTA. You would be doing this to help your mother, who is feeling the pressure of a deadline. \n\nYou would not be doing it for your grandmother, so your feelings for her do not matter.", "YTA - this isn't about your grandmother anymore. It's about helping your own parents.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.

You've disturbed the equation.  Don't be surprised when they fail to step up for you.", "My mom, I\u2019m not even sure if I\u2019m seeing a dime. I know I signed something for the will when I was in college but my mom has made it sound like my sisters and I aren\u2019t getting anything. My mom is getting the money from the sale. She\u2019s told me the money is paying off her credit card debt and student loans, and then if there\u2019s any left it\u2019s going to my student loans", "And I won\u2019t lie I feel a little bit of resentment about the entire situation bc of that", "That is what my boyfriend is saying. On the other side he\u2019s frustrated that I\u2019m not sticking up for myself and he doesn\u2019t think my parents are treating me the best, bc the situation is really triggering my anxiety. So it\u2019s a double-edge sword I\u2019m disappointing people either way", "NTA. You are never an AH for prioritizing your mental health, or for refusing to be unpaid labor in a decision you had no say in.\n\nThe family made their own decision to clean out the house. OP had nothing to do with that decision. There's no reason why her family can't either hire a service or sell the house at a loss in its current condition. She has every right to refuse to be their garbageman.\n\nSource: My father was a hoarder, & he had a lot of property upon which to strew his stuff. His house was sold as is, at a loss, bc it would have taken us months of full-time work & approximately $20,000 in dumpster fees to clean it out.", "I might suggest this to him. I\u2019m not sure how he\u2019ll react. He\u2019s really disappointed that I\u2019m leaning towards going and he wants me to stand up for myself. He doesn\u2019t think I\u2019m setting strong boundaries with my parents, and he\u2019s right", "Yeah I\u2019m looking for a therapist rn I think it\u2019s time to go back", "> I signed something for the will \n\noh that does not sound good. If you are due to inherit, there is nothing you need to sign.  I suspect you signed your rights away. I'd ask about  that.\n\nI really hope I'm wrong. It's just that my father almost managed to get me to sign away the rights to my inheritance when I turned 21, but I actually read the fucking thing. It got ugly when I refused but I got my money.", "As someone who will have to clean out my MILs hoarder house when she passes, I say good for you! I am dreading it, and would never dream of asking my children to help. I will only do it to support my husband.", "If some people are going to give you shit either way, do what suits you.\n\nHonestly IDK why your family didn't just call a house clearance place, most of them round my way don't even charge, they make their money selling the furniture etc that they haul away. I can only assume that your famly WANTED to do it themselves, which is fine, if that's what THEY want. But that needn't involve you. I wonder if it's less about help and more that they feel you don't care. But you don't. Anyway, 48 hours from now it'll be a moot question.", "Do what your gut tells you to do, not what your boyfriend says.  Your entire family is trying to get through this process.  Someday you will need help too.  I think that being with a community of people who are trying to help your mother will be a good experience.  Many hands make light work.  I also bet that you will find out that other family members were similarly treated with abuse.  Talking with them may aide your recovery.\n\nCan your boyfriend help too?  Don\u2019t know how long your relationship with him is, but pitching in and helping is another way for him to be supportive of you.  There will be times when you need support and having an extended family that supports each other is a really good thing.\n\nAgain many hands make light work.  And greater strength and resiliency can come from working through difficult circumstances.  And it is only one day.", "It was so long ago I have no idea what I signed, I mean in all honesty I wouldn\u2019t be surprised", "Exactly, I\u2019m not sure what their reasoning is for not hiring a company. I think doing that would\u2019ve relieved a lot of stress for my family and they probably would\u2019ve made more money. I doubt they wouldn\u2019t let my mom go through the things she wanted to", "Ask. You surely have a right to know.\n\nBut wow, you signed something without reading it?  Not a good idea. But of course when you're a teen, you tend to trust your parents.", "How long ago? If you were not of \"legal age,\" (legally an adult,)  your signature may not even be valid.", "My guess is that it's your mother's way of saying goodbye to HER mother. Plus of course there may just be things she'd like to keep.", "Exactly, it was the holidays, my grandma gave it to me, a few glasses of wine and being around her made me uncomfortable and the topic was morbid, I kinda checked out. I just trusted they were doing the right thing for me", "I wanna say I was a senior in college, so I would\u2019ve been 21", "Oh! If grandma gave it to you, it's probably OK.  I can't think of any way that would affect you inheriting. Phew!"]}
