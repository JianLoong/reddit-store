I\u2019m single and have no kids. So for the past 7 weeks my life has been job, work on my assignments, sleep and repeat. Even on my off days I just do school work all day and catch up on readings and chores. This past week I was I\u2019m on a one week break from school I haven\u2019t had much free time this past couple weeks so I planned on just relaxing and catching up with friends. \n\nI have a friend who has 4 kids (aged 4-6) and just started a new job 2 weeks ago. Before she started working she was a stay at home mom for months and hasn\u2019t really gone out much. So Thursday night she texted me and asked me if I wanted to go to a game night with her new co worker friends on Friday night. \n\nSince I\u2019m on break I told her yes but I have to be home by 12am because I work Saturday mornings and don\u2019t function well at work without enough sleep. She\u2019s off on Saturday but she doesn\u2019t have a car so she told me she was fine with leaving at 12 with me. \n\nShe then proceeded to text me maybe 15 minutes later and said actually change of plans my grandma can\u2019t babysit my kids. Can you come over at 10pm and watch my kids while I go to game night. They\u2019ll probably be asleep and you can sleep too but I\u2019ll be back at 12. \n\nI said no. And said how are you going to invite me to a game night and then uninvite me and ask me to babysit. I love your kids but I don\u2019t want to spend my only Friday night off during my break babysitting. I also have no control on whether she would actually be back 12. I was gonna go to game night to have fun but I don\u2019t want to babysit and sit at your house since I\u2019m always stressed at work I \u2019d rather go home and relax. \n\nShe said I was selfish and she was gonna be back at 12 and that as a friend I should help her out since she hasn\u2019t been able to go out in months. \n\nSo who do you think was in the right or wrong in this situation me or my friend? Was I wrong for agreeing to go to game night and not babysitting  even though I was technically free?\n\nTL:DR \n\nI work a demanding full-time sales job and recently started part-time online school.
