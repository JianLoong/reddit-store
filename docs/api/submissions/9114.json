You just won\u2019t say it so that your father feels bad about how he and your mom damaged you. Your relationship with your parents is not the same as your relationship with your sister and you\u2019re making it the same. \n\nInfo: do you love her but aren\u2019t saying it, or do you just not love her? \n\nAlso, I 100% understand complex dad shit, I haven\u2019t spoken to mine in years, but I would never withhold my love from my sibs.", "YTA you're an adult now that can think for yourself. Your parents may have messed up your childhood, but you're going to mess up your future if you keep acting however you want and just blame them for it.

Now as an adult I realize that actions and services were their way of saying \"I love you\", but to a little kid, affirmation is important, so it made me feel sad that one wouldn't say it. If you tell your sister, for example, that you find it hard to use words but you show love in what you do, meeting her, playing with her, etc, she'll be able to understand it better.
