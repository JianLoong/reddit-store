Now as an adult I realize that actions and services were their way of saying \"I love you\", but to a little kid, affirmation is important, so it made me feel sad that one wouldn't say it.

Tell him to take it up with your parents\u2026 oh wait\u2026", "NTA, it's really not easy to say \"I love you\" when you've dealt with childhood traumas like the ones you describe. Your dad should be teaching his daughter that she can't always expect to hear it back and that it's okay, everyone's different, not get mad at you. Perhaps some \"family\" therapy would help him understand your boundaries? Maybe there's another way you can answer your sister without speaking? Like a hug, doing a heart sign with your fingers, or something (if you feel comfortable doing so).\n\nAnyways, I hope things work out!", "NTA.

But if you love the kid, tell her so, for both your sakes. I hope you\u2019re able to do that one day. Telling the child you love her **is not the same as** telling your father you love him.

I desperately hope that you get some professional help as you definitely have some serious emotional trauma from your upbringing.

I know that's the standard answer, but this is the kind of situation therapy is good for, helping you work through the difficulty things in your past are causing you in your pesent life and relationships. Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying you have to say \"I love you\" to anybody, you certainly aren't required to, but it sounds like you want to and something is holding you back.\n\nYour father should look into therapy as well, but unfortunately you can't control what he does. Good luck, I hope things work out for you", "I'm not going to post a judgement because I don't think this is an \"AH\" matter.\n\nThe conflict is that your sister says \"I love you\" and you who are not emotionally capable of saying it back, yet. This is a matter for your therapist.\n\nIf you don't have a therapist, that's your solution. You need a therapist.\n\nI can't call you an AH because this is a mental health issue you can't yet control. I can't call your sister an AH because she's a child who has done nothing wrong. I can't even call your dad an AH, because while he definitely *was* when you were growing up, you said he's been trying since 2015, and I don't know what he's like now. Sounds like he's trying to build a relationship with his adult child while protecting his minor child, which I can't fault.\n\nI *can* say, I know what the likely cause of your anger at your sister is from. \n\nShe is getting the dad you never had. The dad you deserved. That's not *her* fault, but it still hurts. Your anger is misdirected, but that is something which needs worked through. And once you work through that, your anger at your sister is likely to fade. And likely, you do love her, in your way, and will be able to find the words then.\n\nUntil then, you have 2 equally valid choices. You can refuse to lie to a child, in which case you need to find another way to show her she matters to you. Or you can choose to say the words hollowly, if you're capable, and put her feelings above your own.\n\nHonestly I don't know what the best choice is, and due to that and because I'm no therapist, and this isn't really an advice sub? I can't tell you what you \"should\" do.\n\nBut this isn't healthy for any of you, and I do hope you get help.", "NTA. \n\nHow about you and your sis find a word or phrase you could use instead of the \"I love you\". \n\nExplain in easy terms (without bringing up the childhood part, that's something for when she's older and you want to talk about it) - just that you have a hard time with saying these words and it has nothing to do with her.\n\nTell her that you still want to say it to her somehow and that you want to make it special just for her and you.\n\nIt can be everything: purple unicorn, 3 shooting stars, green cat etc. to show her you care and that you love her. \n\nComing from someone who can't say it easily, I just can't. It weirdest me out and therefore understand where you're coming from.", "NTA. You dont have to say it to anyone and mostly not your parents. BUT.. your sister didnt do anything wrong to you, and she didnt want you to have that childhood that you did. So dont \"punish\" her for your parents mistakes. Only say it to her in the moment if/when you feel it. Big hugs!"]}
