That is an obnoxious habit on her part.\n\nAnd there has to be a reason behind the habit. She may not want to admit it. She might not even understand why she does it.

So things that upset you aren't important and don't matter, but things that upset her are very important and must stop? Is this a pattern with her?", "The last one is something I just used a couple days ago. I generally use it in rare occasions when I've repeated myself so many times I've lost hope, with the IT person or customer service rep who doesn't seem to understand. I generally sounds hopeless and tired because I am. With family or friends who grind my gears, my response is a tort, What did I say? I don't recommend it unless you're extremely angry. Posture, mood, and the death stare makes everyone pause. Use at the last straw. I've also plainly said, I won't repeat myself. \n\nStorytime, I needed a distribution list deleted, I explained there were two for the same group. I want to keep one and update it to reflect the current member and delete the second one that has 2 in the email. He kept asking me the same thing, I kept repeating. Keep in mind, I had created a work order that explicitly explained this, but the person still did it wrong. They updated the email that said two and even though I listed the people to have as a member and who to delete. They instead just added people. I even created two work orders, one for each email. Email2 titled Delete this distribution list. I wrote that line in every field that had a comment. \n\nBack to the call, I have already told him to delete email2. He asked me again, so you wanted to delete email2? Yes, it's in the ticket, he pulls it up, and says, it says delete email2, did you want to delete email2? Finally, I said, I can't explain this in a way you will understand. He then repeats everything I said earlier, as if he perfectly understood. You want to delete email2 and change distribution list one to have these names (says names)... Done. Check if it's complete. I check, and it's complete. \n\nSurprisingly my voice of hopelessness snapped him out of the repeat questions. It's possible that may work for you. Or you can resort to asking her, why are asking me this again? Good luck because, I hate repeating myself and couldn't be you. Remember keep your voice calm as if asking someone to pass the bread bowl at dinner. Don't yell or even sound mildly irritated except in the one example above.", "My X-husband would tell me a different answer every time. He was an abusive narcissist and it gave me Terrible anxiety. I would ask because I wasn't really listening the first time though and it was funny to everyone else that he got super creative with answers", "Not to fully diagnose a stranger but the question pattern sounds almost identical to my brother who had severe obsessive\u2013compulsive disorder. It's been moderated by intensive therapy but it drove me nuts when it was at its worst. He'd also describe it as a meaningless habit.", "Honestly, I'd just stare at her in disappointment, shake my head and walk away every time she did that. Nta", "You're not an asshole, but you should ask her why she does that. Maybe you're missing some trash? I dunno, but definitely talk to her.", "Not a general pattern of behavior, but it\u2019s a fair question. And a good point about an unequal standard. This is probably at the core of what bugs me. Ty.\n\nEdit: clarity", "Not exactly that, but I think you may be roughly onto something here. Very helpful, thank you.", "Yeah that is fair. Thanks.", "Hmm. I'm not sure we are understanding you though. You mean she asked you the question and then kept asking even though you answered?  Sounds odd.", "Yeah that\u2019s right. It seems compulsive or like a verbal tic or something. It is not that she doesn\u2019t believe my answer.", "Does she have other compulsive traits?", "Meh not really but I think ADHD is a factor."]}
