Is this a pattern with her?", "The last one is something I just used a couple days ago. I generally use it in rare occasions when I've repeated myself so many times I've lost hope, with the IT person or customer service rep who doesn't seem to understand. I generally sounds hopeless and tired because I am. With family or friends who grind my gears, my response is a tort, What did I say? I don't recommend it unless you're extremely angry. Posture, mood, and the death stare makes everyone pause. Use at the last straw. I've also plainly said, I won't repeat myself. \n\nStorytime, I needed a distribution list deleted, I explained there were two for the same group. I want to keep one and update it to reflect the current member and delete the second one that has 2 in the email. He kept asking me the same thing, I kept repeating. Keep in mind, I had created a work order that explicitly explained this, but the person still did it wrong. They updated the email that said two and even though I listed the people to have as a member and who to delete. They instead just added people. I even created two work orders, one for each email. Email2 titled Delete this distribution list. I wrote that line in every field that had a comment. \n\nBack to the call, I have already told him to delete email2. He asked me again, so you wanted to delete email2? Yes, it's in the ticket, he pulls it up, and says, it says delete email2, did you want to delete email2? Finally, I said, I can't explain this in a way you will understand. He then repeats everything I said earlier, as if he perfectly understood. You want to delete email2 and change distribution list one to have these names (says names)... Done. Check if it's complete. I check, and it's complete. \n\nSurprisingly my voice of hopelessness snapped him out of the repeat questions. It's possible that may work for you. Or you can resort to asking her, why are asking me this again? Good luck because, I hate repeating myself and couldn't be you. Remember keep your voice calm as if asking someone to pass the bread bowl at dinner. Don't yell or even sound mildly irritated except in the one example above.", "My X-husband would tell me a different answer every time. He was an abusive narcissist and it gave me Terrible anxiety.

Everyone thinks it just means you are organized, but that's not what it is at all. It's second, third, and fourth-guessing yourself constantly. It's ruminating and obsessing.

OCD or something else, the onus is not on you to reassure her over and over. Even if it is difficult, she can likely learn to be okay with asking one question and getting one answer.
