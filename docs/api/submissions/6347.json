I wanted to repost, but DH says I should ask about this instead.\n\nIn September, my daughter, H (11) was asked to participate in a poetry competition. She had two months to pick and memorize a poem. Once a week she stayed after school with the other students doing the event/couple helper teachers who led the kids through exercises/ lessons on emoting and bringing spoken poetry to life. \n\nH memorized The Spider and the Fly by Mary Howitt. She performed it beautifully for us and various other family members to get ready.\n\nThe night before the event, I made sure H had everything she needed since the competition was 1.5 hours drive away and she was carpooling. My husband dropped H off the next morning for the carpool and picked her up that afternoon when she returned.\n\nI was so excited to see H and hear about her competition, but what she told me ground that to a halt: She forgot her poetry folder on her desk. The one thing she needed for her event. The ONLY thing she actually needed to succeed. And after I helped her pack her bag!\n\nH told me she went over her poem one last time before she left, and that's why it wasn't in her bag. Then she excitedly told me how she memorized a new poem in the car on the way to the competition and performed that for the judges. She told me how she hadn't forgotten any of the words and proudly showed me her participation ribbon.\n\nI asked H why she didn't do her original poem that she had spent 2 months MEMORIZING and she said that without the poem in front of her, she kept second guessing the words and decided it would be safer to learn a new poem. I was dumbfounded. I asked why she didn't call. She said they were already 30 minutes away when she realized.\n\nAt this point I told H that it would have taken her 10 seconds to double check her bag like she was supposed to and that she was extremely irresponsible. That she shouldn't have even participated since it was a waste of everyone's time to have to listen to her half-assed poetry presentation. I told her that she clearly had not taken this opportunity seriously and that she needed to apologize to us, her teachers, and the mother who did the carpool for wasting all our time. I also made it clear that since she obviously couldn't handle it herself, I would be getting up with her in the mornings to check her and her backpack to be sure that nothing else was forgotten. \n\nH cried (which she always does when she gets in trouble because she wants us to feel bad for her) and apologized to us before saying that she was going to bed even though it was only 6pm.\n\nIt's been a little over a month since then. With my daughter not keeping her grades up, I brought this up with H again recently to show the pattern that she rushes through things/sets herself up for failure/doesn't do her best. DH thinks I should have let H be proud and am doubly TA for bringing it back up.", "created_utc": 1672711519, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/101v0m4/aita_for_not_letting_my_daughter_be_proud_of_a/", "score": 64, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Kids make mistakes and nerves prior to any competition can result in further mistakes. You are being incredibly hard on her. She's only 11 years old... give her a break.\n\nYTA and going to destroy her spirit if you continue this approach.", "YTA. \n\nYou\u2019re teaching your daughter that her resiliency after a mistake is a bad thing. She\u2019s 11. Maybe commend her on maintaining a level of mental agility enough to get over her mistake quickly and deliver on the spot. \n\nLet her rush to failure. She will learn. You\u2019re pushing her away instead of being a support when she does make a mistake. When she\u2019s older and makes a much bigger mistake, won\u2019t you want her to go to you? This is how children start to despise their parents. \n\nI was one such kid. My mistakes were thrown in my face repeatedly to the point where I now (at 29 years old) am still scared to bring up my mistakes to my parents. I can\u2019t tell you how many times I\u2019ve felt utterly alone because of it. \n\nAlso she cries not to get you to feel bad, BUT BECAUSE SHE IS 11. You\u2019re turning out to be a terrible parent. Be better. Apologize to her.", "YTA. Wow. Just... wow. Accidents and mistakes happen, they're a part of life. Your daughter was excited, screwed up, and not only thought on her feet about how to fix it, but doubled down, did extra work, and not only pulled out a performance on the fly, but got an award for it. \n\nAnd you... ground her into the dirt, belittled her, and brought up what you see as a massive failing. That's awful. Honestly, it's no wonder she's been struggling with her grades, because she likely feels that no matter what or how good she does, it'll never be good enough for you.", "YTA.  Instead of realizing that you've raised a clever and resilient human who can pivot in an emergency, you ran her into the ground.  \n\nHow do you know that her new poem presentation was \"half-assed?\"   Just because you weren't personally drilling it into her for two months?   Consider that she found, memorized and performed a new poem under circumstances that most adults would have found very stressful.  That's impressive, and a skill set that she can actually use as an adult.\n\nYou were far too wound up in all of this--how \"seriously\" did you think should she have taken this \"opportunity?\"  This was a contest...for 11 year olds, not defense of her thesis!  \n\nAnd your DH is right--doubly TA.", "YTA - I highly doubt that an 11 year old is crying to make you feel bad. Especially with the way you describe talking to her. Fuck I\u2019d cry if you were my mom, too", "YTA. \n\nShe made a mistake and you are acting like she committed a crime. She is struggling with ehr grades because you have not only made her afraid to fail, you have made her afraid to not be perfect at all times. And you created so much pressure over a silly contest that she was second guessing herself. \n\nYou need to stop. Encourage her to do her best and then move on. She did her best. She memorized a poem in a short amount of time and performed it. Go her! You couldn't even be bothered to attend her contest so you have no idea how her presentation went. \n\nAnd if I were the mom who did the carpool and your child was forced to apologize to me I would have let her know I was proud of her and that she did well. I may have also quietly added how I felt about the parent forcing her to apologize.", "YTA\n\nPeople make mistakes. Like full grown, fully developed adults make mistakes. They forget things.\n\nYour 11 year old CHILD made a mistake, and instead of panicking or giving up, came up with a solution, memorized a new poem, and didn't forget a single word in front of judges in a stressful situation. AND she was proud of herself.\n\nAnd when your CHILD excitedly told you about her accomplishment: you chose to scold her, and crap all over HER moment! What's wrong with you!\n\nYou should immediately apologize to her, and be proud that she came up with a solution to her own problem. \n\nSeriously, YTA!", "YTA -she is 11 for goodness sake. She made a mistake like any human being does. Also obviously she has a phone as you called her so why not send a picture of the poem at the time? \nWay to bully her.", "YTA - You can let her be proud while it also being a teaching moment. They aren't mutally exclusive.\n\nAlso I highly doubt an 11 year old is crying purposefully to make you feel bad.", "YTA. She is 11. You are going to be the reason for her costly therapy bills later in life if you don't mellow out.", "You just can\u2019t help yourself, can you?\n\nYesterday you were patting yourself on the back for not allowing her to go on vacation with her grandparents, because her grades weren\u2019t up to your standards.", "YTA. She\u2019s a kid who made a relatively minor mistake. Instead of freaking out about it or bothering you to correct her mistake, she had the wherewithal to memorize an entire poem and the poise to perform it in a competition. \n\nYes, it\u2019s annoying that she forgot the one essential thing she needed but these things happen. What is incredibly impressive is how she handled it.\n\nThe only lesson you\u2019re teaching her by being hyper focused on her mistake and throwing it in her face is that she should avoid telling you about mistakes, big or small, because you are not a safe person to confide in. Personally, that\u2019s not a message I\u2019d want to be sending to my kid. Unfortunately, it seems like she may already have gotten that message since she opted to give up two months of hard work instead of calling you to ask for help.", "YTA. \n\nShe\u2019s 11. She wanted to practice more and made a mistake and forgot her folder.\n\nShe came up with her own solution and was still able to participate. You should be proud.\n\nMistakes happen, learning how to roll with them is a huge life lesson your daughter figured out. \n\nInstead of supporting her growing as an i individual you keep holding the mistake part of it over her head.\n\nDon\u2019t be surprised if she ends up LC when she\u2019s 18\n\nEdited to add- Let her go on the trip. You are a really shitty parent.", "YTA. Wow. Yes, you're the AH. In the context of the other post, I think you should really consider why you insist on framing your daughter's behavior in such a consistently negative light. \n\nBy the way, your daughter showed remarkable skills in both problem solving and memory. I hope you don't diminish her this way often.", "YTA. You\u2019re CHILD made a mistake and you were absolutely hateful to her! YOU should be the one to apologize for your mean and hateful comments!!! Maybe her grades are dropping because her her parent has made it clear that she can\u2019t do anything right! You are despicable!", "Yta  way to overract", "YTA!  You are a bully!  She is only 11 and she problem solved and took the responsibility to learn a new poem\u2026she is amazing.  How dare you tell your child she wasted everyone\u2019s time.  You completely belittled her.  No wonder she\u2019s not keeping her grades up when you have unattainable standards for her.  Kids are not perfect.", "YTA and I wonder if you are being serious. Your daughter made a mistake which is very common for even very reliable adults to do. She found a wonderful solution to her problem which you should be praising her for. This was not a situation where her grades mattered, where money was involved, it was purely an event for children to show off. It is such an insignificant event that your daughter shined in, yet you are making her feel terrible about it. There is a time to just be child and simply have fun, gain new experiences, and not be chewed up because you didn't play the extracurricular game exactly as the rules were set out. She did not hurt anybody and this poetry contest was about her not you.\n\nYou need to apologize to her and let her know that you actually care about her and not just how good her memorization/performance is. You need to be there for her, not just there to watch her mistakes and criticize her. I can only imagine how sad she feels that her parent is still upset with her, and never even complimented her once on what she did good. By all means, tell her she should have checked her bag; but it seriously is not that important. You don't need to be that serious about this one incident. And yes she actually did do good and you should be proud of what she did well. \n\nAgain, this was an inconsequential event and she showed how resourceful she was by memorizing a new poem. She's not being irresponsible, she made a mistake. Be her constructive fan, not her hateful enemy. Build her self-confidence; right now you are ripping it away.\n\nYour view that she is deliberately misbehaving is off. Don't be angry about mistakes, she may be clumsy or very dumb. Should you make her feel bad for the rest of her childhood if she really is like that? No! But she isn't. She's very smart and resourceful. She will grow up, she will grow her skills, and she will continue to make stupid mistakes just like everyone on this planet. Support her and don't take things so seriously, especially such inconsequential events.", "YTA  \nYou describe your response to your \"imperfect\" child  as trying to destroy her sense of self worth and dignity - you describe attempting to mentally harm her.    \n You have to know that   trying to further  impair your child because you see them as defective and unworthy  is an AH move.   \n\nYou feel  your child is functioning below their capacity. So have their obvious symptoms assessed.   Again and again until there is an answer, trust your instinct that her capacity is greater.   And outside of  the appointments help drop the subject of her imperfection    Maybe write \"NUTURE\"  down and  pin it the fridge to remind you of your role.  and another one \"unconditionally\" \n\nYou are   better than this.  It is  of course awful that you were trying to remove her  hope for the future,  but perhaps you were raised that allowing  imperfect people to  have pride and human dignity was wrong?  It is good that  have reflected  about if your behaviour is AH.   \n\nYou describe  symptoms in her  that could be any one of a number of disorders,   but do not overlook the possibility that being raised by someone who  tears her down could be the problem.\n\nThe great thing is you do not have to feel  kind to behave in  a kind way.  If you pretend that you still care for her even though she  is imperfect that will be less than ideal but will always be much better than openly  giving into  any desire to tear at her while still in the nest.   \n\nThank you for asking  this question. I hope you will able  to get some counselling  and try to let your little child thrive.\n\nIf you are right and your little child has to cry to make you feel any compassion or  caring - You say  that even that  does not work to make you care -  perhaps consider counselling?. Perhaps you have some unresolved trauma. As a parent is  your duty to let her know you feel for her and accept her warts and all long before she thinks to seek reassurance.", "Your daughter has just learned that the only way you will ever love her is if she is perfect and does everything exactly as you tell her to do. She knows that she does not matter to you. That you only care when her life is absolutely perfect. Any emotion outside of gratitude and happiness is unwelcome and viewed as some plot against you. If she\u2019s upset, it\u2019s only to emotionally manipulate you.

I imagine in a few years you'll be posting again wondering why your daughter went NC with you as soon as she could, and you'll have no one to blame but yourself.\n\nEdit: I used an incorrect word", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I wanted to repost, but DH says I should ask about this instead.\n\nIn September, my daughter, H (11) was asked to participate in a poetry competition. She had two months to pick and memorize a poem. Once a week she stayed after school with the other students doing the event/couple helper teachers who led the kids through exercises/ lessons on emoting and bringing spoken poetry to life. \n\nH memorized The Spider and the Fly by Mary Howitt. She performed it beautifully for us and various other family members to get ready.\n\nThe night before the event, I made sure H had everything she needed since the competition was 1.5 hours drive away and she was carpooling. My husband dropped H off the next morning for the carpool and picked her up that afternoon when she returned.\n\nI was so excited to see H and hear about her competition, but what she told me ground that to a halt: She forgot her poetry folder on her desk. The one thing she needed for her event. The ONLY thing she actually needed to succeed. And after I helped her pack her bag!\n\nH told me she went over her poem one last time before she left, and that's why it wasn't in her bag. Then she excitedly told me how she memorized a new poem in the car on the way to the competition and performed that for the judges. She told me how she hadn't forgotten any of the words and proudly showed me her participation ribbon.\n\nI asked H why she didn't do her original poem that she had spent 2 months MEMORIZING and she said that without the poem in front of her, she kept second guessing the words and decided it would be safer to learn a new poem. I was dumbfounded. I asked why she didn't call. She said they were already 30 minutes away when she realized.\n\nAt this point I told H that it would have taken her 10 seconds to double check her bag like she was supposed to and that she was extremely irresponsible. That she shouldn't have even participated since it was a waste of everyone's time to have to listen to her half-assed poetry presentation. I told her that she clearly had not taken this opportunity seriously and that she needed to apologize to us, her teachers, and the mother who did the carpool for wasting all our time. I also made it clear that since she obviously couldn't handle it herself, I would be getting up with her in the mornings to check her and her backpack to be sure that nothing else was forgotten. \n\nH cried (which she always does when she gets in trouble because she wants us to feel bad for her) and apologized to us before saying that she was going to bed even though it was only 6pm.\n\nIt's been a little over a month since then. With my daughter not keeping her grades up, I brought this up with H again recently to show the pattern that she rushes through things/sets herself up for failure/doesn't do her best. DH thinks I should have let H be proud and am doubly TA for bringing it back up.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
