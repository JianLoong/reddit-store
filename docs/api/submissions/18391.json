Be out in 30 if you don't want to hear shit\" even once every couple weeks, let alone if you do it more often than that. \n\nMaking the concession of 'if you're doing something important I'll go somewhere else' doesn't help when you just want to live in your own home and, unless your meetups are occurring in the middle of the day, you're also regularly kicking her out at night on short notice when she might be relaxing or getting ready for bed. Home is supposed to be a safe space for relaxation; if your roommate can't get that because she's uncomfortable constantly leaving (or being expected to be able to leave) or having strangers there having sex, I can understand it being incredibly frustrating.\n\nSounds to me you're both being awful roommates to each other. I'd suggest having a conversation to air out whatever resentment has been building up and come up with a better system (set days hookups are allowed at the apartment or maybe multiple days' notice when you'll be going out and planning to come back with someone rather than an hour) or start looking for a new place to live. Your lifestyles are very incompatible.", "Info: since no one has explicitly asked, when you bring over hookups are you like 'im bringing this person home, you need to prepare' and also, how often is this? Because I can see how awkward it could get having a super active roommate (socially or sexually) just TELLING me that random people would always be in the place i also pay for. Its a fine line because you pay as well and should enjoy, but there is also things like courtesy and respect. So I'd like to know where exactly you and your roommate stand on those lines. Have they expressed to you at all that they feel like random people are in the home too often? Or did she just decided to hold her problems in and explode?\n\nEDIT: OP is an inconsiderate sex-haver and should focus on maturing and possibly getting their own place to have sex, because that's what mature adults do when they want to live that lifestyle. If you want it, get it. But don't blame your roommate for losing her shit over your unsafe practice of bringing strangers into a shared space, not matter if you're having sex or just hanging out. There is a reason we dont just invite strangers into our homes, and its not okay for you to use a roommate to offset the cost of rent and then subject them to strangers in thier space. \n\nI hope your roommate finds the correct words to use against you- no slut shaming, but letting you know how immature you're being.

If her roommate had raised concerns about security that would be a different conversation. As it is, OP\u2019s level of promiscuity isn\u2019t her roommate\u2019s business, and also doesn\u2019t justify an invasion of her privacy.", "I mean, OP does mention that they do often go to someone else's place to do this, most likely the partner at the moment, so it's completely unreasonable to expect OP to always do this. It is also OP's space, therefore OP is allowed to have guests. I feel as long as it's equal, (as an equal amount of times bringing people over as going out) then there really isn't much that the roommate can complain about.

Meaning she could have looked through the rest of the phone. Whether she did or not is the question. But just taking something that has most people's very private info, pics, or other personal stuff and just going through it without permission is a no-no, and admitting she went through one app open the potential she could have went though much more.

She also made it seem like it was men she knew already and only once a week, but in a comment admitted it was complete strangers and new men multiple times a week. \n\nBut the one thing she did put in the main post that leads me to YTA is that she expected her roommate to leave every single time OP wanted to have sex. Once a week is fine whatever. 3-4 times a week with a new stranger every time is unacceptable and a good way to either have things stolen or be murdered.", "Or they literally changed their mind which is more than fair.
