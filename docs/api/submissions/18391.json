I like to do things with all kinds of people. A lot of the tiI'llme go to someone's place, or I'll bring someone over, but I will always tell my roommate about it so she can leave or be out when we do stuff, or to give her a fair warning if she does need to stay.

I try to be considerate.  \nHowever, the last straw was apparently a week ago when I was listening to music and playing games in my room. I had headphones but my phone was face up, and that was where my music was playing from. My roommate walks in (without knocking btw) to ask me something about groceries. She sees my phone face up, and sees music playing.  \nMy roommate asked me about my music so I told her the song, which was a well known song about lesbian sex, and she asked \"Oh, is that in your 'sexy times' playlist?\"  \nThe thing is, that was the exact name of the playlist, so I ask her how she knew about it. Turns out, I had left my phone on once because I was getting up to get a snack, so she decided to look through my spotify.  \nI was angry, because I felt it was a violation of privacy. I told her, \"Hey, can you not look through my personal stuff please? I like having privacy\" while trying to be as polite about it as possible.  \nShe says \"Its hard to not look when you flaunt it around all the time\", which I felt was kinda uncalled for. I asked her what she meant, which made her go on this long speal about how I need to \"Stop flinging my sex life about\" and \"Stop being a slutty whore\".  \nThings have been tense as hell between us for the past week, and I don't know if i'm the asshole here.

Interesting situation but it sounds like the roommate tried to turn the issue about you when it should have been an apology for going through your phone.", "NTA, you're considerate in letting her know and cancelling when needed.

And even if she were annoyed with you bringing people over, how does that give her any right/have any relevance to snooping through your Spotify ?? \n\nShe was caught snooping (I had a roommate that did the same; eventually she was lifting clothes and money from my room/purse) and didn\u2019t have a good defense so she brought up your sex life as, like, a very poor deflection. The fact that she slut shamed you and used those words for you make her even more of an asshole.", "NTA\n\nAnd Jesus fucking Christ people, lock your phones!", "She may not be happy with your active social life, but I bet you are having a lot more fun.

Not sure what your point is other than arguing.", ">if your Playlist is on Spotify no privacy was violated.\n\nYour words.

So, it's a moot point. \n\nI'm pointing out that you are utilizing some weird word salad in your response to OP \"Not trying to argue just laying out the facts\" which many may take as a way to sound superior while not actually contributing anything meaningful to the conversation. You can continue doing that if you so desire, I'm just attempting to give you some perspective. The ways in which you are responding here make it look like you are not someone that is truly seeking truth.\n\n>Not sure what your point is other than arguing.\n\nThis reads as a projection.", "Ok so you want to get technical,  I remember a few years ago that supreme court of the United States declared that there is no expectation of privacy if it is online.
