My wife\u2019s mum is British, and her dad is french. When she was young, her parents got divorced. So, her youngest twin siblings (16f&16m) live with their father full time.\n\nI don\u2019t see them often because they live in France and only visit their mum and other family members during Hanukkah(they\u2019re Jewish) or summer break. The twins rarely talk to anyone in the family and mostly speak to each other in french. \n\nNow my wife\u2019s sister (the girl twin), we will call her Bella. I\u2019ve heard she has terrible anxiety and is a vegan. They came over to visit last month during winter break. Bella was, as usual, quiet and kept it to herself. \n\nMy wife decided to host a get-together dinner and invited the twins. Bella reminded her she was vegan and asked if she could get anything. My wife told her not to worry about it. My Wife, however, decided to cook steak, pork and other meat and completely disregarded Bella\u2019s request. \n\nWhen the twins arrived, Bella looked completely confused at all the meats, so she asked my wife if she had forgotten about her request and told her she could just uber it. My wife blew up on her and screamed at her to eat what she cooked because she was so skinny. Bella, after getting yelled at, started tearing up and had a panic attack. Her twin brother and older brother(22M) managed to calm her down, but her dad went off on my wife. \n\nI tried to keep peace and stayed neutral initially, but once everyone left, I defended Bella and berated my wife\u2019s behaviour. My wife cried and called me a bad husband for protecting someone I didn\u2019t know well. Now she\u2019s no longer talking to me, and whenever I try to say something, she tells me to go to Bella(?) I no longer see my wife like how I used to, and I'm not sure if this is a red flag. What if she treated our kids this way in the future? \n\nSome of my friends say I should\u2019ve at least defended my wife in front of her dad when he screamed at her. AITA?\n\n\nEdit: I would also like to add that my wife left Judaism, hence the pork. I\u2019m not Jewish, BTW.\n\nUpdate: pasting this from the comment BTW\n\nFrom what I know, she was never close to her dad's side of the family because they all speak french. The twins obviously speak french cause they live there, and her other brother learned french in school and visited them often. My wife never bothered learning and doesn't visit them. My wife was bullied as a child for her beliefs and nose, so she left the religion(that's what she told me)\n\nBullying someone over their nose is shitty, I know, but Bella has a small button nose. Now I remember when my wife made side remarks on it and even jokingly said she wanted Bella\u2019s nose. I don't know how serious this issue is, but if she\u2019s jealous of a 16 yr old, I don\u2019t think I want to be in this relationship anymore. I want to try therapy, but she\u2019s not speaking to me. I\u2019ll try talking to her again once she returns from work. We\u2019ll see where it goes from there.\n\nAs for the body, my wife is short and slightly overweight, but I still find her beautiful. she was obsessed with losing weight when we first met but is comfortable with her body now. But Bella is tall (5\u20199), and everyone in the family encourages her to become a model, and my wife gets mad when this gets brought up and tries to change the topic. If it\u2019s what I think it is, I don\u2019t feel comfortable having kids with her. I don't know how to go on about this. I love my wife, and I want to fix this, but will she change this behaviour overnight?", "created_utc": 1679484471, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11yg169/aita_for_defending_my_wifes_sister/", "score": 506, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She feels attacked (it's normal, anyone that gets reprimanded feels attacked) and won't really come to reason while that is true. If you can talk about it and she can open herself, maybe with help from a professional, things could get really good. It's my own experience, I was your wife in my own story.

Why would anyone defend a bully.  No offense OP but maybe you should be looking at your wife differently.

Yes, yes this is a huge red flag. Maybe your wife has hidden trauma or abuses she's not revealing but she definitely acted abusive to her teenage sister.

That\u2019s just personal observation, btw, I am no kind of mental health professional and my advice as a stranger on the internet is always going to be suspect.\n\nIt\u2019s time to evaluate this relationship. Is this uncharacteristic of your wife? Or is it an escalation of behaviors you were already seeing? Your comments have been enlightening on that front, but this is something only you can evaluate for yourself. Because the final question in this line of evaluation is the big question: is this a dealbreaker for you?\n\nYou\u2019re definitely NTA for confronting your wife about this.", "sounds like your wife has some baggage she doesnt handle well to say the least\n\nimho its ok if she needs some more time to cool before you can talk like adults about this because this might go back a long time for her\n\nperhaps you should think about what outcome this is about to you in the long run. what extend of recognising or working on her issues would you require of her? would you tolerate her to expect of you to \"be on her side\" no matter how ridiculous her stance is in the future again? does her behaviour damage your trust in her? would you be fine with her \"solving\" this issue pragmatically by mostly avoiding her family and thus blocking most potential for this conflict to come up in the first place?", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYour wife is an abusive AH. You REALLY should reconsider this relationship.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd: What if your daughter looks like Bella? DON't have kid's with your AH wife.", "NTA Your wife is targeting Bella and bullying her. It needs addressing very soon.", "Your wife is bitter and is going to eat away at your soul in the years to come if she doesn\u2019t change her ways and if you\u2019re not honest with her about how you\u2019re feeling", "NTA for reasons all echoed in other comments.\n\nBut OP, you're trying to beef up courage to divorce your wife based on a single -- although unacceptable -- incident that's been described here to us. People freak out for all sorts of sublimal reasons but if this was the first time you'd witnessed something concerning, I wouldn't think you'd jump straight to considering divorce after several years of marriage without trying to figure out what is going on. My guess is that she has plenty of other red flags and this happened to be the straw that broke the camel's back and you want others to weigh in on it for your own peace. If that's the case, man, you don't need validation - you have to do what's best for you.", "She was being abusive and you called her on it.  Being a faithful partner does not require you to go along with cruelty and envy.  \n\nIf you leave, tell her that her behavior toward Bella was so horrendous; so inexcusable that you suddenly realized you don\u2019t know her at all.  Tell her you and she will separate as you cannot love someone so cruel to a child. Let her know this is her issue and any remedy is hers to find or she needs to find a partner as cruel as she is do she doesn\u2019t have to change.", "Your wife is a bully and is deliberately serving her family unclean food. Imagine someone putting shit on the table and telling you to eat. That's the equivalent of her serving them pork.", "NTA you should definitely not have stuck up for when she was in the wrong all that would do is enable her to think she is right in treating her sister so badly, she needs to kept accountable even as her husband, her insecurities make her a toxic walking \ud83d\udea9, and now she's giving you the silent treatment ( #1 manipulation tactic) until you apologize and give into her. She seems to be mean and a bully and not about of bullying in the past can excuse that.", "NTA, but you should have called out your wife\u2019s behavior in front of everybody.  She deserved to be humiliated for what she did to that girl.  I could t be with someone who acted like your wife did.  I am so disgusted right now and I was not there.  If I was there, I certainly would have lost it at your wife, apologized to the girl, and told my wife to get out of the house as I don\u2019t want to even look at her for at least a week and then I\u2019d decide if I even wanted to be married to her.", "NTA \ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\nWow! I'm so sorry for Bella", "NTA. \n\nAnd OP, no, this behavior doesn\u2019t improve. My stepmom was like your wife, saw her step kids as competition for my dad\u2019s attention, and it never got better.", "NTA but you are married to a really bad person... if you ever have kids, she will treat them the same way. Absolutely disgusting.", "NTA", "NTA - being a good husband doesn\u2019t mean defending AH behavior.", "NTA. Your wife was terribly in the wrong (serving pork to a Jewish vegan who asked her to please consider her diet and them screaming at her!) and you were more than loyal enough not to speak up against her in the presence of the rest of the family. She seems to have a troublesome competition with her younger sister that she never overcame. So no, she won't change \"overnight\" but she needs to address this issue in regard to her sister. Telling you \"to go to Bella\" is inappropriate and immature. She needs to settle this farcical sibling rivalry.", "NTA. Your wife deliberately excused \"Bella\". Least she could have done was be understanding when Bella offered to just Uber food because she literally cannot eat anything at that get together. I commend you for sticking up for her sister. and I hope you continue to stick up for people when you feel like they aren't being treated nicely, especially when it's happening right in front of you.", "NTA Your wife is jealous of her sister and is behaving badly. You can\u2019t under that. She needs therapy and she owes Bella and apology.", "Thank you for recognizing there is times a spouse is completely in the wrong and shouldn\u2019t be supportive in these kinds of situations. Usually I say support the spouse but like you said there\u2019s limits!", "I think you\u2019d have a point if Bella was undefended but it sounds like nobody was on his wife\u2019s side, so Bella was getting support.", "All my Jewish friends love bacon, they make a point of it.", "Your wife sounds like a bully. If you don\u2019t have kids yet you may want to rethink the marriage. I personally couldn\u2019t be with someone who has no empathy", "Your wife lied to her own sister, telling her to \"not worry about it\". Your wife has serious issues, bullying a 16 year old. Ask her if she is proud of herself? Does she feel good about abusing someone 10 years younger? How would she feel if the situation was reversed? That she wanted meat products but all that was offered was a veggie meal and she is told to just suck it up?\n\nNTA. I'd be telling my wife that what she did is very ugly and she needs to see a therapist ASAP. She is a loose cannon. I wouldn't be surprised if her family distances themselves from her for the foreseeable future. \n\nThis will only change \"overnight\" if she realizes that, the bullying she used to get, she just delivered to a child. Maybe she will see the light but I doubt it. Therapy may help but she has to want to change... and work at it.", "NTA Your wife is in the very least a bad host.  She seems jealous of a child.  The poor child has issues and your wife made them worse.", "Nta. You should have done that as soon as she started yelling", "OP, listen to your instincts. They aren\u2019t wrong. NTA.", "What pisses me off is that Bella actually had no issue to cal Uber for her food, but your wife completely disregarded that and berated her, it's so humiliating.\n\nYour wife is a major AH\n\nNTA.", "They may not follow all the dietary rules. Since they\u2019re her family, she\u2019d probably know which if any they follow. If they don\u2019t eat pork, then add another item to the passive aggressive column. OTOH, if they just avoid treif (forbidden foods like pork), they did have other choices. Unlike the poor little sister.", "NTA\nThe red flags on your wife are BRIGHT and I\u2019m glad you can see them. \nWho treats a child like that? How will she treat your future teenage daughters when they outshine her too?", "How can your wife be so unkind to anyone, much less a younger family. member ?  Your DO NOT DEFEND ABUSIVE BEHAVIOR.  You protect the vulnerable.  kt", "NTA. Your wife badly needs therapy over what she went through in the past. You should support her as she goes through it, BUT, never let her do anything like this again.", "NTA. You waited to speak to her about it in private which was the right thing to do with a spouse. Its ok to call out awful behaviour. Your wife sounds jealous of her sister. And she did a whole food drama thing to punish Bella because of her feelings. I'd be very concerned that she behaved that way to a child guest she was hosting, whose food and emotional issues she was aware of prior to the day."]}
