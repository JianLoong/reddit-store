My wife\u2019s mum is British, and her dad is french. When she was young, her parents got divorced. So, her youngest twin siblings (16f&16m) live with their father full time.\n\nI don\u2019t see them often because they live in France and only visit their mum and other family members during Hanukkah(they\u2019re Jewish) or summer break. The twins rarely talk to anyone in the family and mostly speak to each other in french. \n\nNow my wife\u2019s sister (the girl twin), we will call her Bella. I\u2019ve heard she has terrible anxiety and is a vegan. They came over to visit last month during winter break. Bella was, as usual, quiet and kept it to herself. \n\nMy wife decided to host a get-together dinner and invited the twins. Bella reminded her she was vegan and asked if she could get anything. My wife told her not to worry about it. My Wife, however, decided to cook steak, pork and other meat and completely disregarded Bella\u2019s request. \n\nWhen the twins arrived, Bella looked completely confused at all the meats, so she asked my wife if she had forgotten about her request and told her she could just uber it. My wife blew up on her and screamed at her to eat what she cooked because she was so skinny. Bella, after getting yelled at, started tearing up and had a panic attack. Her twin brother and older brother(22M) managed to calm her down, but her dad went off on my wife. \n\nI tried to keep peace and stayed neutral initially, but once everyone left, I defended Bella and berated my wife\u2019s behaviour. My wife cried and called me a bad husband for protecting someone I didn\u2019t know well. Now she\u2019s no longer talking to me, and whenever I try to say something, she tells me to go to Bella(?) I no longer see my wife like how I used to, and I'm not sure if this is a red flag. What if she treated our kids this way in the future? \n\nSome of my friends say I should\u2019ve at least defended my wife in front of her dad when he screamed at her. AITA?\n\n\nEdit: I would also like to add that my wife left Judaism, hence the pork. I\u2019m not Jewish, BTW.", "created_utc": 1679484471, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11yg169/aita_for_defending_my_wifes_sister/", "score": 59, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She is Asshole big time. \n\nWhat i do not get is why she screamed at you to go to Bella. Does she have some insecurities or jealousy problems? Or maybe emotinon outbursts? I would see it as red flag, but it can be some mental problem. Or she can be just asshole.", "NTA\n\nBut this is clearly an issue that your wife resents the kids and that needs to be addressed.", "NTA. And frankly, your wife's behaviour that night was concerning as is her subsequent attitude. I strongly suggest you get to the bottom of this. \n\nIs your wife insecure? Is Bella objectively pretty?

Your wife had no right to yell at her like that. Not only is it hurtful and this experience will upset Bella for a long time, but wanting to change someone's diet? Seriously??? Your wife is a massive AH here. She literally gave her a panic attack! Good on her for her family for standing up to Bella. Your friends are wrong.

It\u2019s a stretch to say this is how you will treat your children, however wrong is wrong!  She is an adult and intentionally behaved in an antagonistic way and should be mature enough to deal with the consequences. She needs counseling.", "NTA. That poor girl. \n\nYou waited until the scene was over to address your wife's behaviour. In terms of 'defense' that's the best your wife could hope to get. Personally, I'd have struggled to not interject at the time.\n\nThis isn't an advice sub but this really isn't the sort of thing you should sweep under the rug. Your wife absolutely must take accountability. \n\nIs she generally jealous or insecure? Has she displayed any previous hints to mental health issues? Did she actually want the family there?", "NTA. You did right. If part of this group is Jewish, why pork? Going off her sister. Don't think you'll be hosting any of the twins or Dad again. Sounds like your wife went out of her way to cause a problem.  Do you always try to be nice to Bella? It's a flag of many kinds.", "NTA\n\nI don't know what's going on with your wife but there's clearly more to the story. Her 'go to Bella' jab proves that.\n\nI don't know if she has a problem with her father and Bellas relationship but she's a grown woman who shouldn't be taking whatever this is out on a child.", "NTA RUN!!!", "NTA your wife was beyond cruel to her own sister that says a lot. I wouldn\u2019t have kids with this women.", " NTA\n\nWhat she did was wrong. It isn\u2019t about who you know well, it is about being a decent person. And you wife, well, wasn\u2019t.\n\nYou seemed to have stayed quiet in company which is about all she could possibly ask for. In private you should be able to be open and disagree without this kind of reaction from your wife, so yes, this is indeed a red flag.", "I agree, this behavior is weird as f\\*ck.", "My wife left Judaism after she turned adult, but now that's you've mentioned it, I feel like she deliberately had it to piss everyone off? But no one commented on it. Again the dinner didn't really go on cause everyone left after the fight.", "Sounds like there is lots of animosity between your wife and her family", "NTA.\n\nYour wife:\n\n\\- Passive-aggressive (that thing with the food...).\n\n\\- Yelling at her sister out of the blue.\n\n\\- Body shaming.\n\n\\- Giving you the cold shoulder because you didn't back up / enable her disfunctional and antisocial behavior.\n\nYou really need to talk about this when she doesn't get defensive. She feels attacked (it's normal, anyone that gets reprimanded feels attacked) and won't really come to reason while that is true. If you can talk about it and she can open herself, maybe with help from a professional, things could get really good. It's my own experience, I was your wife in my own story. Now I'm happier by myself, it really has nothing to do with you or her sister or whoever, it's a problem of your wife that your wife would enjoy solving even if you break up.\n\nThe alternative is: more conflicts like this in the future, with more people, maybe with your own children involved, and she resenting you more and more for not backing her up when it happens, and you resenting her more and more for being such an AH, so divorce or unhappy marriage.\n\nI recommend you try to make this clear to your wife, along with your love (make her feel loved), and seek counseling for a better life.", "Op i left my dad's religion as an adult and have a fairly bad relationship with the religion itself bit if someone asks for a food accommodation for themselves like vegan food or something other than pork etc I am definitely going to try and accommodate them.  What if one of your kids were to become religious, how would your wife treat them.  I recommend marital counseling", "Your wifes a B\\*\\*\\*\\*. She DELIBERATLEY was nasty to her sister. I dont know why. She KNEW she was a vegan, she deliberatley didnt make any food she could eat. Then she berated her until she was crying because she wouldnt eat what was put in front of her. Now she's upset because you call her out on that because you dont know her? MASSIVE RED FLAG. NTA", "NTA your wife is such a TA wow shame on her.", "NTA - you needed to talk to your wife about being a good hostess. She left your guest basically without food!  That's unacceptable. As for defending her you should ask your friends what they think happened?  I'd certainly be upset if I was invited over to dinner, discussed the food I do and don't eat beforehand in friendship, only to arrive and have not only nothing to eat but a wide variety of things I can't eat ready to go! \n\nYou need to ask your wife what was she trying to achieve by doing what she did and how did she expect people to react? \n\nOther than that if I was in your shoes I'd make sure that I took care of my guests in future. To avoid repeat problems.", "NTA, you're not obligated to defend your wife when she's entirely in the wrong. And this is a giant red flag, better to get out now while you can before there are kids involved. It's clear there is some underlying issue here but this was a wildly inappropriate and cruel way of dealing with it.", "NTA, also it would be very funny if she said go to Bella and you said 'Ok' and left the house to chill somewhere else.\n\nHuge Red Flag, she fixes her shit of you find a better woman to marry.", "NTA - how can you defend someone so horribly wrong. I think she should be thankful you waited until everyone left to address it with her. I probably would have taken everyone but her out for a proper meal that all could enjoy.\n\nBut you might want to get your wife some therapy. this sounds like more like some type of unresolved sibling jealousy rival / daddy issue BS especially if you say she never acted like this and is a new side to her.  \n\nI am not religious at all but even I know you don't serve Pork to those of the Jewish faith but you said she left Judaism so she clearly did. What a weird and poor power play on her part to prove something no one else understood.", "So not only did your wife Intentionally prepare food her family couldn't eat, she body shamed and screamed at a teenager. And then doubled down\n\nAnd then she's telling you to go be with the teenager? Is this unusual behavior for her? Because honestly I'm baffled and also not sure how this continues on unless she has a genuine understanding of how wrong she is\n\nNTA", "NTA, but your wife is horrible", "NTA. Clearly by serving meat to vegans and pork to Jews your wife was trying to stir shit up. \n\nDoes she hate or resent them all and want them never to come back? Or is she just always mean and horrible? If they were abusive or she has trauma I can see trying to cause a rift, but in that case she should have warned you.", "NTA\n\nBest case your wife is a mean girl and I would think hard about the marriage because mom's like that WILL give their kids long life issues", "Can I just point out that not only was the wife terrible to Bella but also the boy twin and there father, and older brother, they are JEWISH and she literally served them PORK", "Because he defended Bella. That\u2019s a sign of jealousy. She thinks because he defended his kid SIL that he wants Bella over her.", "Excellent point."]}
