Your family aren't AHs for wanting to see the baby, either.\n\nHowever, I wanna address something about your post. It seems like you have a negative filter of the way you view life, and that seems to come from the anxiety and the getting told about you overreacting. So here's some unsolicited advice:\n\n1. Tell your family members to stop saying that you are overreacting. Tell them to stop using the word and all its variations around you. Set this very clear boundary, and live by it.\n2. Go to therapy. There are free and low cost counselling services in many first-world countries, and there are online therapy services (not as good but it's something).\n3. If you don't have medication for your anxiety, ask your doctor to be referred to a psychiatrist. They will assess you, and provide you with the right meds so that you can live with your anxiety.\n\nYou can take any or none or all of this advice, but it's there for you to consider (or ignore, it's fine if you just ignore it).

You know that going there will make you feel a certain way, and you feel like your ability to protect your baby will be compromised due to the people who have consistently railroaded you and your feelings. It\u2019s not fair for you to make an unnecessary trip with a baby who hates being in the car, a trip you don\u2019t even want to go on. You don\u2019t want to be pressured into passing your baby around. You don\u2019t want to hear how they parented, because quite frankly, their version of parenting was doing whatever the fuck they wanted regardless of the baby\u2019s/child\u2019s feelings. I have a feeling, based on my own experience, that you will do your best to be in tune with what your baby needs vs what everyone else tells you to do. However, getting into that environment without being prepared with a strong backbone will be a shit show internally for you. And guess what? Babies feel our energy. \n\nI\u2019ve got two recommendations for books to help with coping skills: Untamed by Glennon Doyle, and Set Boundaries, Find Peace by Nedra Glover Tawwab. Great foundational pieces that help frame what boundaries are and how they should be used. Most importantly, a boundary is something you set for yourself- it\u2019s not to control others\u2019 actions. \n\nIt is not your responsibility to step outside of your comfort zone to make your family happy, or to simply appease them. Your responsibility is to you and your baby. You need to get your mental health in order, first and foremost.
