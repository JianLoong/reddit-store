I am a high school-aged girl who lives in the United States, as context. And I haven't shaved my legs in... probably around three months? Something like that. But it's also been summer vacation, so I haven't really cared.\n\nThe problem is, school starts up again next week, and my mother has forbade me from going to school without shaving my legs. She actually told me that if I haven't shaved my legs by the night before the first day of school, she will \"discipline\" me, and then shave my legs herself. (NOTE: she's not preventing me from going to school, she's just going to make sure that when I go, my legs are shaved.)\n\nProblem is... I just don't want to. It's time consuming to shave my legs, and then it itches for weeks while the hair is growing back (no matter how much lotion I use, I've tried, it doesn't really help). And while a lot of people will probably just say that I should shave my legs regularly... again, I just don't want to. And it's my body, so why should I have to?\n\nSome of her brilliant reasons for why I should shave my legs:\n\n1. It's unhygienic for women to not shave their legs. Of course, my brother has such long leg hair that it's actually curly. It's like a fuzzy blanket of hair covering his legs. If he shaved that off, you could make a wig out of it. I'm not exaggerating. But she literally told me that men don't have to shave their legs, but as women, we have to. She even told me that my leg hair is \"offensive\" to her. Yes. She said that. I wasn't aware my leg hair had that much power!\n2. I'll get bullied for it. She told me that \"teenage girls are shitty to each other\". So, I asked her if she wanted me to shave my legs so I wouldn't get bullied. She said yes. I said I didn't care if I got bullied over something as stupid as leg hair (because, news flash, I've gone to school before with unshaved legs, and nobody has ever said something about it!). And that's when she started screaming at me because I wasn't just agreeing with her. As a side note: I told her the only person who seems to care about my leg hair is her, and she said, \"that you know of\". Well, I don't care, and my friends think it's sexist to make me shave my legs, so....\n3. Because she told me to. Now, this one's my favorite. She tells me that she gets embarrassed over my \"lack of hygiene\", and that she's telling me to shave my legs, so I have to. That's it. End of discussion right there.\n\nNow, I'm going to be completely honest here, I'm pretty sure I'm NTA. But I'm asking anyway, because at the very least, it'll give me some insight as to why she thinks the way she does, and/or how to convince her she's being ridiculous. And, hey, maybe if enough highschoolers come on here and say they don't care, she'll rethink her position!\n\nOn the other hand, if I am TA, then I'll apologize. Either way, I'm shaving my legs, just because I'm sick of her yelling at me over it.", "created_utc": 1691543204, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15m0fzc/aita_for_not_shaving_my_legs/", "score": 347, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She picks all of them, I can't remember the last time we've disagreed on something and it hasn't turned into a battle....", "I honestly never knew this before!

The only person to do that has been my mom (and my dad, I suppose, but he really just finds any chance he possibly can to control another aspect of my life).

I personally hate not shaving my legs, but I'd always end up cutting myself with the razor or being itchy and bumpy. Until I started using one of those crystal hair scrubber things. It exfoliates and removes the top layer or so of skin so when I go over it with a razor it's silky smooth. \n\nBut OP you're NTA. If you're comfortable with leg hair, that's fine. It's your body.", "I wish honestly. I read somewhere that once you start shaving anything, it starts growing differently. Like, my leg hair used to be so light you couldn't even see it, and fairly short, too. Ever since I started shaving (read: my mother FORCED me to start shaving) it's been growing in super dark and long. Maybe if I'd never shaved in the first place, it never would've become a problem.

It\u2019s really only in the last 30 or so years that not shaving legs and armpits has become less unusual in the western world. I still recall the gasps of shock when the singer Nena was performing her song 99 Red Balloons (or 99 Luftballons) and raised her arms while dancing to reveal unshaven pits.

Maybe it'll force her to give me a real answer! I'll go to her and tell her all the scientific reasons why NOT shaving my legs is better (therefore it's NOT unhygienic), and she'll be forced to admit to me that it's because she wants to conform to societal standards. And then I'll bring up this! And if it doesn't work, and she doesn't cave, then at least she won't be able to lie to me anymore. She'll have to tell me to shave my legs not because it's unhygienic or embarrassing, but because she hates it personally, and her opinion is apparently more important than mine.", "I honestly appreciate having this perspective, both from someone my mother's age and someone my age.

It was debilitating, I was sobbing, and it took her a full day to finally bring me to urgent care, while my dad said it was stupid and I would get over it. Well, turned out I had an infection in my intestines, and it could've been really bad for me if we'd listened to my dad. Even when I sprained my ankle and couldn't put any weight onto it without sobbing in pain (I was 15 so I wasn't like a little kid crying about everything, I was in pain), my mom had to beg my dad to take me to urgent care because she had to go to work. And then he almost missed our appointment because he didn't see the point of it (they ended up giving me crutches and excusing me from PE for the rest of the semester because it was so bad, but my dad took away my crutches after a week and my ankle still doesn't quite feel right).\n\nBasically, I'm glad your mom is this diligent about your health and safety!

But that only lasts a day, and then they're stubbly again, and I eventually came to the decision that it's just not worth it anymore.

I looked at them and told them that since they were allowed to have smelly hairy armpits, I did to. And since I washed and put deodorant on, at least mines weren't smelly. I never allowed the \"but you're a girl\" excuse to matter. I continue to this day to pluck/wax my armpits every 3 to 4 weeks, but it's mostly because I'm used to it.

My legs aren\u2019t very hairy, but I use an epilator as it lasts longer than shaving, and there is no risk of cutting myself or razor burn, or ingrowing hairs. In fact using an epilator weakens the hair roots and the re-growth is finer as the hairs have to regrow from scratch. Doing this faithfully, eventually the number of hairs reduces as some of the hair roots die off.\n\nIt\u2019s similar to waxing your legs, but less painful, and there is no risk of burns because the wax was too hot.

She didn't push the legs as hard as the underarms, but it was an issue. One summer, I was forbidden to wear sleeveless tops until I shaved my underarms. (I was raised in Texas, USA, and summers were hot!) Next, it was no shorts or dresses until the leg hair went. I even had to shave my toes to wear sandals. (Also, the lip hair had to be waxed and eyebrows perfectly groomed. It was a nightmare.)\n\nAnd you're right. Your mother is being ridiculous. She's falling for old tropes designed to manipulate women by convincing them that they must change themselves physically to be attractive and feminine. There is nothing unhygienic about not shaving.
