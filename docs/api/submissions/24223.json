I am a high school-aged girl who lives in the United States, as context. And I haven't shaved my legs in... probably around three months? Something like that. But it's also been summer vacation, so I haven't really cared.\n\nThe problem is, school starts up again next week, and my mother has forbade me from going to school without shaving my legs. She actually told me that if I haven't shaved my legs by the night before the first day of school, she will \"discipline\" me, and then shave my legs herself. (NOTE: she's not preventing me from going to school, she's just going to make sure that when I go, my legs are shaved.)\n\nProblem is... I just don't want to. It's time consuming to shave my legs, and then it itches for weeks while the hair is growing back (no matter how much lotion I use, I've tried, it doesn't really help). And while a lot of people will probably just say that I should shave my legs regularly... again, I just don't want to. And it's my body, so why should I have to?\n\nSome of her brilliant reasons for why I should shave my legs:\n\n1. It's unhygienic for women to not shave their legs. Of course, my brother has such long leg hair that it's actually curly. It's like a fuzzy blanket of hair covering his legs. If he shaved that off, you could make a wig out of it. I'm not exaggerating. But she literally told me that men don't have to shave their legs, but as women, we have to. She even told me that my leg hair is \"offensive\" to her. Yes. She said that. I wasn't aware my leg hair had that much power!\n2. I'll get bullied for it. She told me that \"teenage girls are shitty to each other\". So, I asked her if she wanted me to shave my legs so I wouldn't get bullied. She said yes. I said I didn't care if I got bullied over something as stupid as leg hair (because, news flash, I've gone to school before with unshaved legs, and nobody has ever said something about it!). And that's when she started screaming at me because I wasn't just agreeing with her. As a side note: I told her the only person who seems to care about my leg hair is her, and she said, \"that you know of\". Well, I don't care, and my friends think it's sexist to make me shave my legs, so....\n3. Because she told me to. Now, this one's my favorite. She tells me that she gets embarrassed over my \"lack of hygiene\", and that she's telling me to shave my legs, so I have to. That's it. End of discussion right there.\n\nNow, I'm going to be completely honest here, I'm pretty sure I'm NTA. But I'm asking anyway, because at the very least, it'll give me some insight as to why she thinks the way she does, and/or how to convince her she's being ridiculous. And, hey, maybe if enough highschoolers come on here and say they don't care, she'll rethink her position!\n\nOn the other hand, if I am TA, then I'll apologize. Either way, I'm shaving my legs, just because I'm sick of her yelling at me over it.", "created_utc": 1691543204, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15m0fzc/aita_for_not_shaving_my_legs/", "score": 114, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I've been giving in on the armpit shaving, but based on all the hygiene facts people are telling me, I may stop shaving them too....", "I'm not sure she knows how to pick her battles haha. She picks all of them, I can't remember the last time we've disagreed on something and it hasn't turned into a battle....", "I honestly never knew this before!

The only person to do that has been my mom (and my dad, I suppose, but he really just finds any chance he possibly can to control another aspect of my life). Then again, maybe they're talking about it behind my back? But based on the comments I'm getting here, no one cares at all....", "Yeah. I personally hate not shaving my legs, but I'd always end up cutting myself with the razor or being itchy and bumpy. Until I started using one of those crystal hair scrubber things. It exfoliates and removes the top layer or so of skin so when I go over it with a razor it's silky smooth. \n\nBut OP you're NTA. If you're comfortable with leg hair, that's fine. It's your body.", "I wish honestly. I read somewhere that once you start shaving anything, it starts growing differently. Like, my leg hair used to be so light you couldn't even see it, and fairly short, too. Ever since I started shaving (read: my mother FORCED me to start shaving) it's been growing in super dark and long. Maybe if I'd never shaved in the first place, it never would've become a problem.

It\u2019s really only in the last 30 or so years that not shaving legs and armpits has become less unusual in the western world. I still recall the gasps of shock when the singer Nena was performing her song 99 Red Balloons (or 99 Luftballons) and raised her arms while dancing to reveal unshaven pits.

Maybe it'll force her to give me a real answer! I'll go to her and tell her all the scientific reasons why NOT shaving my legs is better (therefore it's NOT unhygienic), and she'll be forced to admit to me that it's because she wants to conform to societal standards. And then I'll bring up this! And if it doesn't work, and she doesn't cave, then at least she won't be able to lie to me anymore. She'll have to tell me to shave my legs not because it's unhygienic or embarrassing, but because she hates it personally, and her opinion is apparently more important than mine.", "I honestly appreciate having this perspective, both from someone my mother's age and someone my age. Honestly, I feel like the only people who would bully me for having leg hair are people I don't want to be around, anyway.

The amount of new information I've gotten from this post is insane to me.\n\nAlso, I'm pretty sure she's only using \"unhygienic\" as a substitute for \"socially unacceptable\", because she always seems to follow it up with some comment about how it's unhygienic because \"we live in this country, in this society, where women have to shave their legs\" or something like that.", "Looool this made me laugh.

It was debilitating, I was sobbing, and it took her a full day to finally bring me to urgent care, while my dad said it was stupid and I would get over it. Well, turned out I had an infection in my intestines, and it could've been really bad for me if we'd listened to my dad. Even when I sprained my ankle and couldn't put any weight onto it without sobbing in pain (I was 15 so I wasn't like a little kid crying about everything, I was in pain), my mom had to beg my dad to take me to urgent care because she had to go to work. And then he almost missed our appointment because he didn't see the point of it (they ended up giving me crutches and excusing me from PE for the rest of the semester because it was so bad, but my dad took away my crutches after a week and my ankle still doesn't quite feel right).\n\nBasically, I'm glad your mom is this diligent about your health and safety!

Constantly. I love the feeling of having freshly shaved legs, how soft and smooth they are. I used to lay in bed right after a shower and just rub my calves together. But that only lasts a day, and then they're stubbly again, and I eventually came to the decision that it's just not worth it anymore. I totally understand people who love to shave their legs and where they're coming from, I just personally would like to do without the bending over backwards to try to eliminate every single hair off of my skin.

Exfoliating immediately after shaving may make it itchier.\n\nI remember in high school I didn't like shaving and at one point when I decided to wear a mini skirt I did a rush shave job with just water and lotion immediately after and had a bunch of red bumps.

If she wants to shave her legs and wear tampons, then bless her heart, she can shave away. But if you don't want to do that, you don't have to, and ask her if this is how she wants to ruin your relationship.

I have two younger teens and a daughter in her early 20s. Their body hair is their business, not mine.

I personally do not have the energy to battle with my son over stupid stuff. Anyway. I get why you would shave just to shut her up tho. And you seem to have a really good head on your shoulders...not caring about being bullied for stupid stuff, but also the willingness to accept that you will soon be free to do as wish, without worrying too much about how shitty things are in the present.

Look at reviews and look for fresh popsicle sticks and cleanliness. If you can\u2019t have it done at a waxing salon then try the at home kits. Read the directions and watch some videos. But it can be painful especially if you go slow which is why I don\u2019t suggest doing it at home. Especially on your first time. The exfoliating before the waxing is really important. Use a sugar scrub or whatever and gently scrub all the dead skin off. It will help bring any of the hairs under the skin to the surface.

Some moms are just controlling about some things. It's not an excuse though.

It\u2019s a weird issue to have with your parents. I agree nobody should be touching you or forcing you to do it, and I don\u2019t know your mom, but I doubt she wants to abuse you.
