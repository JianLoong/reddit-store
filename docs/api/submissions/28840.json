{"id": 28840, "submission_id": "1772yip", "title": "AITA for wanting to move out?", "selftext": "I (F25) currently live at home with my dad, brother (M17) and sister (F22). The housing market is horrendous and I\u2019m in college and also working full-time, so living at home is the best option for me right now. The deal always was as long as I\u2019m working or in school, I can live there rent-free. I still help with chores and upkeep of the house, but I\u2019m rarely home between school, work, and spending time with my long-term partner. Here\u2019s where things get crazy. My brother is obviously underage and in high school, so this rule doesn\u2019t apply to him. My sister, however, doesn\u2019t have a job, isn\u2019t in school, and is 7 months pregnant. As her due date gets closer, she seems more and more inclined to keep the baby she has been telling us all she wants to give to adoptive parents that are better equipped to care for an infant. Her boyfriend has a child from a previous relationship that he doesn\u2019t have contact with, but pays child support. I am very adamantly child free and never want kids of my own.  Now it looks like there\u2019s going to be a newborn in the house in about 2 months and I want no part of that. I am a nanny full-time and while I love kids, I also love coming home to a quiet house full of adults. I\u2019ve talked to my partner and he\u2019s on board with us trying to buy a house and renting out a room to one of his current roommates to make ends meet. I told my family that I plan on leaving if there\u2019s an infant in the house and my sister and dad both insisted I was \u201cselfish and dramatic\u201d and that a baby \u201cwouldn\u2019t affect my life in any way\u201d, but I take care of kids for a living and am very aware of all the ways they affect everyone in the house. My sister hasn\u2019t really been taking to me since I mentioned moving out and my dad is acting like I\u2019m being a brat. I just didn\u2019t sign up to be around a baby and have a grown man I barely know move into the family home. And don\u2019t even get me started on why the school and job rules only seem to apply to me. So, AITA?\n\nEdit: some people are pointing out that it sounds like I have my family an ultimatum and I promise I didn\u2019t! Sorry if it sounds that way, I was trying to be as concise and objective as possible. We were having a little \u201cfamily meeting\u201d about all the changes coming and I mentioned moving out as I know my own faults and know it wouldn\u2019t be the best living situation for me due to school and work and other obligations I already have in place.", "created_utc": 1697215206, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1772yip/aita_for_wanting_to_move_out/", "score": 16, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

They should be proud of you for trying to make that work, and freeing up the space for the baby's father.\n\n\"a baby wouldn't affect my life in any way\"  is a huge red flag about how defensive they're going to be about the child.\n\nYou've made the right call, good luck!", "NTA  They are losing a maid and babysitter, so of course they are going to be upset. You're 25 and should be living your own life. The fact that your sister didn't use protection, isn't your problem.", "But - if you're not paying rent, how is moving out being \"selfish and dramatic\" and how would it negatively affect them in any way?\n\nNTA.", "NTA - The only way moving out would be selfish is if they expected you to suddenly pull some magical extra hours out of somewhere to care for this newborn. Especially with you being in school and working it is perfectly reasonable for you not to be able to help with the child. Even if that weren't the case, a newborn at home would add so much chaos. You moving out opens up a room for the kid and more space for your family.", "NTA, they're just mad you wouldn't be able to help with the upkeep of the house anymore", "NTA\n\nStrategically, I probably would've just said I wanted my own space and wanted to live with my partner. The way it was framed I can see your sister feeling like you're saying \"I'm only moving out because you won't give that child up for adoption.\" Regardless of how valid or responsible that is, I can understand that being upsetting.\n\nHowever, let's talk about the elephant in the room. You're a nanny. You \"help with chores and upkeep of the house\" and it seems like your younger siblings do way less of that. You're a classic oldest-sister situation where I'd wager you do the lion's share of chores/upkeep, same reason why the job/school rules apply to you but not the younger siblings. It's only selfish because your father knows no one else is going to pick up the chores/upkeep slack, and it's only selfish because both your father and sister were absolutely banking on the fact that a professional nanny lives with them whenever there are needs for childcare.", "You were going to be her live in nanny, that\u2019s why they are upset about you moving out because you squashed those plans and now they will have to deal with a new baby in the house (not you doing it for her) your Not The Ass!", "NTA. You can choose where you want to live and you're most certainly old enough to move out. Take no credence to your Dad's claims. It's important to have a peaceful space you can retreat to after a long day's work. \n\nOf the options before you - your sister moving out with the baby or you moving out with your bf I'd imagine the latter be more reasonable.", ">  I told my family that I plan on leaving if there\u2019s an infant in the house...\n\nWhile your reason for moving out is 100% valid and you don't even need a reason, this line reads a little bit like an ultimatum.\n\n\"I'm moving out because I don't want to live with kids\" is fine.\n\n\"Either the baby leaves or I leave\" is not fine.\n\nAnd the sentence you wrote could be interpreted as either.\n\nSo INFO: Did you give them an ultimatum? or is it possible you phrased things badly?", "NTA But you WERE overly dramatic. If you weren't issuing an ultimatum just tell them you're moving out and be done with it.\n\nNo need to  tie it to the baby.", "If you can move out already and buy a house,  then go.  No need to mooch around any longer.", "You didn't \"sign up\" for anything.  You just never left home. You chose to stay there with people who also get to live their lives. You don't have to want to live with a baby but the way you presented it was very selfish and don't be surprised when your sister doesn't talk to you or let you spend time (if you wanted to) with your niece or nephew.  You could have worded it a bunch of nicer ways but you didnt. I wouldn't want to live with the boyfriend but the mention of him was an afterthought in the post. You can be child free and also not be so judgy about someone who doesn't want to be.  2 things can be true. And if you want to keep living rent free you will have to shut up and suck it up. Good luck with the house and high interest rates. I'm sure you will be happier with your boyfriend and his roommate. YTA for insensitivity.", "ESH - You have a valid complaint about you two being treated differently and everyone knows \"a baby \u201cwouldn\u2019t affect my life in any way\u201d\" is a flat-out lie. I don't blame you for wanting to leave. \n\nBut I'm including you as an asshole because of the approach. Your parents are obviously trying to be supportive of your sister at a time when she needs it. Yes, the child is her decision. Aborting or surrendering a child is a very difficult decision to make. You're more self-sufficient than she is, which is great. She might be making a bad decision. But you're holding that difficult decision against her and against your parents because it results in uneven treatment between the two of you. I don't think you're wrong for wanting to move out, but you could've brought it up in a way that sounds less judgmental towards the rest of your family. You're 25, it wouldn't be unusual to move out regardless.", "NAH. Move out and find a peaceful space. Careful though, a roommate situation might be worse.", "NTA; the only thing I think you did wrong was the wording, but even then you're still NTA. You don't have to live in a house with children, especially after working with kids all day (I know how that is !). Plus, your sister is *not* going to be taking care of that kid the way she should be. You're the only one being held to certain standards *and* your sister keeps mentioning how you'll be there to help *and* her boyfriend has a kid already that he doesn't have anything to do with which doesn't give any sort of confidence that he'd take care of this kid *and* your parents are blaming you for moving out. I think they just want you around because they don't wanna be the ones taking care of the baby because they know your sister won't and if you're there, you have the responsibility passed on to you.", "NTA. Time for you to leave.", "NTA... moving out is the wise option in this situation.", "Nah\n\nIt's time for you to leave the nest, and you're doing that. The way you told your family, though not intended as an ultimatum, sounded like an ultimatum, so their reaction might also be justified. \n\nIf you had just said \"this house is getting crowded, and it's time for me to be out on my own (with roommates lol)\", then there wouldn't have been any problems.", "NTA gee they don\u2019t want the childcare professional to leave I\u2019m so shocked/s.\n\nGeneral advice: you are an adult you don\u2019t need to share your plans with your family.  Make announcements.  I am leaving on this day end of conversation.\n\nBouncing ideas off family generally lets them feel they have a control or say.", "That\u2019s what I\u2019m afraid of! I know how much work it\u2019s takes to care for a baby, I do it every day. My sister is being incredibly naive about it all", "They just want her for extra help around the house lol, they don\u2019t have a leg to stand on here", "Oops, it wasn\u2019t meant to sound that way. I just meant that whatever my sister chooses, I want her to be happy. However, I\u2019m aware of my own faults and know that having a baby in the house full-time and being pushed to help out with that wouldn\u2019t be good for me on top of my schooling and work and that I plan on looking for a new place to live, should things come to that. My sister was insinuating that I\u2019d be able to help out with the baby \u201cbecause of my job experience\u201d and I know that I don\u2019t have enough energy to take care of children all day and then come home and potentially have to continue caring for children. It definitely wasn\u2019t an ultimatum and more of a \u201chey I know things are changing and I think that I may need to live elsewhere if this isn\u2019t a good environment for me\u201d", "I only mentioned the baby because it\u2019s sort of the straw that broke the camels back in terms of reasons for me staying vs leaving as there\u2019s a whole host of other issues that have been starting to outweigh the benefits of being able to save money for my future because I\u2019m not paying rent. And my family was like \u201cwell why would you leave??\u201d So here we are, unfortunately:(", "I\u2019ve been waiting until I have enough saved up. I don\u2019t yet, but things are forcing my hand a little in order for me to have a living space that feels safe and comfortable", "I\u2019ve been doing my part and everything that my family has asked of me, while also trying to be prepared for my own future. At the beginning of the agreement with my father, he was very insistent on if we were starting our own families, we\u2019d have to get our own place. We all deserve to feel safe, relaxed, and comfortable in our own home. My sister has been insinuating that I \u201cwill be great to have around because I can help with the baby\u201d as if I\u2019m not a full time student and have a full time job. I\u2019m not ready to be a parent, nor do I think I\u2019ll ever be. There\u2019s also a whole host of other family issues that I didn\u2019t put here because it didn\u2019t seem relevant. I didn\u2019t mean to sound callous in my wording, I was just trying to be as concise and objective as possible", "So no comment on the parents having one set of rules for one daughter and a completely different set for the other? Nothing about the younger sister's 'plan' seems sensible so it makes sense for OP to make different living arrangements. The only reason why dad is calling OP a brat is because the family was counting her for childcare.", "I\u2019m sorry if my wording sounded judgmental, I definitely didn\u2019t mean it that way and was just trying to state the basis of what was said. I obviously want my sister to be happy and know that giving up a kid is hard. But I\u2019m also aware enough of my own faults to know that I wouldn\u2019t be happy living in that environment.", "Save yourself. Not your problem. \n\nIf you let her she will suck the life out of you. Learn young to set boundaries for yourself and how you spend your time.", "I totally get that, and it's too late now, but I would have kept the baby out of it. Now, if she gives it up for adoption, they're going to blame you. And, if she keeps it, I wouldn't trust them not to tell the kid his aunt wanted them to give it away. It was also guaranteed to damage your relationship with your sister.\n\nI would have just gone with needing more independence at your age and/or wanting to spend more time with your bf. \n\nBut what's done is done. Good luck with everything.", "The preferential treatment is another big reason for me leaving, but it didn\u2019t seem super relevant to why my family is currently mad at me", "They're mad because theyre losing their live in babysitter/helper for around the house. There is nothing selfish about wanting to live your own life. I hope it works out for you.", "I appreciate it! Im pretty scared to do this huge life step already"]}
