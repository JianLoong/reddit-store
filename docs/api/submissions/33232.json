Relationships grow and develop as kids get older, and parents and kids don\u2019t always adapt at the same pace. \n\nTry telling your Dad that you\u2019re headed up to your room to study, and ask him if there\u2019s anything he needs before you go upstairs.   Otherwise, how is he to know you\u2019re studying and just not doing something else? \n\nMaybe also suggest that if it isn\u2019t urgent (as in your example) he could text you instead - so he can accomplish what he wants immediately and you won\u2019t be interrupted.", "It's hard to say for sure without actually knowing your father. My dad did the same to me. It might be part power trip, but it's also a way that a lot of men try to bond with their sons. Let's face it, a lot of men are terrible with emotions or maintaining relationships with certain people. One way men do is through working on things together or similar activities (e.g. hunting and fishing). Likewise, him shouting for you to come down may be his way to have some face time with you, even if it's to bark an order or mention something irrelevant. Can you imagine some men calling their son down just to \"talk\"?", "NTA\n\nYour dad is power-tripping in the way some dads do. \u201cMy kid will do what I say, when I say it.\u201d\n\nThey often turn into the kids who never call once they leave the house, and leave txt messages on \u201cread\u201d.", "NAH. It's not constructive to constantly yell across the house to each other. It's difficult and it's annoying for other people in the household. In some cases, it's an emergency. However, it's also frustrating to be constantly interrupted. \n\nFigure out a compromise. The easiest one I've found is setting up a google home or alexa system so that you can talk to each other via the sets. You can achieve the same thing by texting/calling if you're both good with phones, but parents often misplace them or leave them for charging in another room.", "My mom was like this too.

If you refuse, YTA.", "NTA It\u2019s not rude necessarily, but I feel like there\u2019s an easy fix for both of you which is if he\u2019d allow you time to come down. If you can respond by telling him you\u2019ll be there in a minute and he could accept that it\u2019s an easy middle ground because by him saying you have to come down the instant he calls you he\u2019s assuming whatever you\u2019re doing is not as important as whatever he needs.
