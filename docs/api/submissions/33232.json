Everyone shouts at me and expects me to arrive to see what they all want. Kids and husband may I add. I have told them all I hate being shouted for and to stop, if you want to talk to me come find me. It all fell on dead ears. So now I just pretend I can't hear them and don't reply. Then they come and find me to ask me whatever random shit they need. You're welcome!", "NTA, but get an intercom or Amazon Alexa so you can communicate without all the up & downstairs", "NAH this is all normal family stuff.  Relationships grow and develop as kids get older, and parents and kids don\u2019t always adapt at the same pace. \n\nTry telling your Dad that you\u2019re headed up to your room to study, and ask him if there\u2019s anything he needs before you go upstairs.   Otherwise, how is he to know you\u2019re studying and just not doing something else? \n\nMaybe also suggest that if it isn\u2019t urgent (as in your example) he could text you instead - so he can accomplish what he wants immediately and you won\u2019t be interrupted.", "It's hard to say for sure without actually knowing your father. My dad did the same to me. It might be part power trip, but it's also a way that a lot of men try to bond with their sons. Let's face it, a lot of men are terrible with emotions or maintaining relationships with certain people. One way men do is through working on things together or similar activities (e.g. hunting and fishing). Likewise, him shouting for you to come down may be his way to have some face time with you, even if it's to bark an order or mention something irrelevant. Can you imagine some men calling their son down just to \"talk\"?", "NTA\n\nYour dad is power-tripping in the way some dads do. \u201cMy kid will do what I say, when I say it.\u201d\n\nThey often turn into the kids who never call once they leave the house, and leave txt messages on \u201cread\u201d.", "NAH. It's not constructive to constantly yell across the house to each other. It's difficult and it's annoying for other people in the household. In some cases, it's an emergency. However, it's also frustrating to be constantly interrupted. \n\nFigure out a compromise. The easiest one I've found is setting up a google home or alexa system so that you can talk to each other via the sets. You can achieve the same thing by texting/calling if you're both good with phones, but parents often misplace them or leave them for charging in another room.", "My mom was like this too. I think it's just a parent thing for the most part.", "My parents used to do this shit all the time and it was annoying as hell. I just started pretending like I didn\u2019t hear them shouting my name", "Fairly typical parent power trip. Unfortunately not a lot you can do as it's highly unlikely he will recognise this in his own behaviour l, otherwise he would self correct already. \n\nMake it painfully clear it pisses you off, if your dad ignores you and continues. Chalk it up as another reason to not text him back once you leave home", "NTA\n\nSeems like a controlling person who enjoys power tripping and doing things like this just to show he has authority over you.\n\nI wonder if his legs don't work since he can't seem to come to the attic himself. I'd ask that, but since I don't know your dad's temperament, he might blow up at you.", "[deleted]", "Presumably it\u2019s easier for you to run up and down stairs than it is for your father to do so thanks to younger knees and hips. Therefore it makes sense for your parent to call your name to come down when he wants to tell you something. Yelling through the house about what the topic is prior to coming down is a bit obnoxious. Assuming the interruptions aren\u2019t every ten minutes or something you should come down when your father asks for you to do so. If you refuse, YTA.", "NTA It\u2019s not rude necessarily, but I feel like there\u2019s an easy fix for both of you which is if he\u2019d allow you time to come down. If you can respond by telling him you\u2019ll be there in a minute and he could accept that it\u2019s an easy middle ground because by him saying you have to come down the instant he calls you he\u2019s assuming whatever you\u2019re doing is not as important as whatever he needs. So if you could come to an agreement about giving you time to find a place to stop doing what you\u2019re doing then both of you might feel better.", "NTA, why doesn\u2019t he text like a normal person?", "YTA. Listen to your dad.", "NTA. Pretend you didn't hear him so he can come to you.", "His house, his rules\nHe calls, you run", "Geez, he's your dad. Not gonna kill you to run down there to see him. Probably just wonders what you're doing, wants to see you. Play a card game with him, or sit and talk to him a little bit. I used to get up early and my dad and I played crazy eights and talked. Believe me, it was the best thing I ever did. I heard funny stories of our family, relatives I never knew. We grew close. Never pass that up, time goes quicker than you think.", "My daughter is the reverse of this. NTA", "I was taught that when an adult calls your name, you don\u2019t say what or yell back. You say ma\u2019am or sir, and if you\u2019re in the other room you get off your butt and then go to them and answer with ma\u2019am or sir. It shows respect and order. I prefer it that way. It\u2019s probably how your dad was raised too because it\u2019s old fashioned. But I can see a lot of that manners and respect stuff is lost on newer generations.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Please let him read this. My husband does the same thing, the only kid that did is 38 and will never be a self sufficient adult. He should be glad his child has the sense to ask questions be for blindly listening. We\u2019ve e had to buy him a house and my self employed husband pay his idiot to not work for him and we had to buy him a home to get him out of ours. My husband enables him. Anyway my point, give him time it\u2019s hard to watch kids grow up. You never stop worrying, loving them, and wanting the best for them. If he\u2019s a good dad it will get better with time and you getting life experience. Definitely NTA", "Just a guess\u2026\u2026do you spend a lot of time up in your room? He may just be wanting to see you! Are you spending time together as a family or do you come out just to eat meals? If he\u2019s calling you for unimportant things, my guess is he\u2019s lonesome for your company. He\u2019s your father. Talk to him when he asks. Spend some time with him. I wish I still had mine.", "I\u2019ve never been in this situation myself, as i grew up with my mother and my older sister in a small condo. However, based on 34 years of being alive and having eyes and opinions, I would say this seems like pretty standard issue family things.\n\nWhile tone and other factors do come into play to justify his response to you questioning him, at face value i never liked the power dynamic parents have over their children \u201cit doesn\u2019t matter why, you come when I ask\u201d it\u2019s really demeaning like I\u2019m not your kid but rather you golden retriever. You\u2019re a teenager under their roof but you\u2019re also a human being. I know technology is ruining the family dynamic or whatever but if it was important, he could\u2019ve called or texted you, he could go to you or in the same breath that he yelled your name to come down he could\u2019ve just said what he needed. But god forbid you argue then the word disrespect flies out and honestly you lost this fight before it began.", "NTA. My parents used to do this to me, but I was born in the 70\u2019s. Hasn\u2019t he heard of texting?", "This is what I was going to suggest.  \n\n\nWe had a single floor house for the longest time, but the family was typically spread across it, on opposite ends. We have a family chat channel we keep open for this exact reason. And for those who didn't have chat open, we had Alexa devices in most places so we can use that instead.\n\nI really don't think it's necessary to shout or interrupt what's going on until and unless you know it's urgent. \n\n(Please note: most of my family is neuro-divergent. Interrupting us in the middle of studying/a task often will completely derail us and it can take a lot to get back into what we were doing. Another reason why we like the chat option.)", "My husband and I text between the basment and second floor. Sometimes it feels lazy but it's the best way sometimes.", "I don\u2019t like it but it\u2019s kind of true.

He could be playing a game, he could also be studying or crying, or listening to music.", "It\u2019s rude to yell across houses. If you need to speak to someone go to them and speak.
