{"id": 3289, "submission_id": "z57127", "title": "AITA for wanting my MIL out of our house?", "selftext": "Several months ago, my wife and I were in the process of buying our first house. At the same time, my MIL got the news from her husband that he met somebody else and wanted a divorce. She had been out of work for years at that point, and had to very quickly get a job and find out where she was going to live. Obviously it was a terrible situation, and our house had two extra rooms, so I told my wife that she should live with us for 6 months to a year until she could get on her feet. MIL agreed only under the condition that she contributes because she said that she didn't want to feel like she was mooching off her kids. Fair enough.\n\nFast forward 10 months, she has not saved a dime, she has not even looked for a better paying job than the first one that she got a year ago, and she is consistently late paying her share of the bills despite having the money to buy herself a new phone and all other sorts of luxuries. My wife even sends her money every now and then because MIL runs out despite her working full time and not having that many other bills. It has become a huge point of conflict for my wife and I. MIL does not pay for any groceries unless it's a snack food that she takes to her room, she very rarely does the cooking, she does the dishes maybe once or twice a month, does no communal cleaning of the bathroom etc because she is \"too sad\". Essentially, I feel that she is not contributing to our house in any way like she originally said she wanted to and is taking advantage of our kindness to help her get on her feet without making any effort to live on her own.\n\nNot to mention her overwhelming negativity and constant \"jokes\" making fun of my wife, myself, and our dog. I am honestly fed up at this point.\n\nI have brought this up to my wife, and my wife got insulted that I would talk about my MIL like this. My wife feels like it's our responsibility to take care of MIL while she's \"vulnerable\". I told my wife that enabling MIL to just live somewhere and forgive her for not paying bills and not contributing to keeping the house livable is not helping her and that we need to start pushing her to get out on her own, but my wife thinks that I am reneging on our original agreement since MIL is not on her feet yet. It always gets brought up that it was my idea for her to live with us in the first place, and that if I wanted her to save money we should just not charge her rent. We argue about it fairly consistently, and I don't see it coming to any conclusion anytime soon. \n\nSo AITA for wanting to push my MIL to get out when I originally gave her up to year?", "created_utc": 1669467662, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z57127/aita_for_wanting_my_mil_out_of_our_house/", "score": 32, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I would be so embarrassed!!! If I couldn't afford to help with money I'd be helping with cleaning, cooking and other things. \nThe MIL/ mom is being very ungrateful and needs to be talked to.

I agree that we should sit down and look at her budget though to try and figure this all out.

OP is NTA.", "I agree with you and a previous commentor. My communication was subpar. I didn't set out distinct expectations and that's on me. I said six months to a year, and didn't go much further than that. I will be doing so very soon though.", "I do agree, my communication skills could use some work. I will try to sit down and come up with clear expectations for the coming months.", "Don't threaten it unless you mean it. But I do think you should consider that it is a marital issue that your wife is using you to financially support her mother and doesn't care about the agreements she made with you. It feels like you're the third wheel in your marriage"]}
