I'm originally from a large city so I'm not used to living with neighbors where everyone is constantly nosing into everyone's business and it's been difficult for me to adjust to this. My boyfriend, who grew up around here, has been imminently more tolerant.\n\nWe have an incredibly adorable cat who shares our living space but is kept indoors. Because she is an indoor cat, we often leave the front window open which has a screen on it so she can get fresh air and yell at the squirrels. The screen slides open so we generally only leave the window open when we're in the room to keep an eye on her. I should also mention that Ive been studying for an important exam that I'm taking this Friday that I have to pass in order to graduate.\n\nLike I said, I've gotten accustomed to the fact that this complex may as well have its own tabloid, but what really irks me is when people come up to our window. I'm extremely protective of my privacy and it makes me feel uncomfortable for people to randomly appear at my window unexpectedly. They do this because of the cat. They talk to her or sometimes tap on the screen. I've mentioned to my boyfriend more than once that it really irritates me and I feel like him knowing this may have motivated what came next.\n\nSo, the incident:\n\nYesterday afternoon, our directly next door neighbor's niece, a younger girl, came up to the window while my boyfriend and I were in the front room. I was studying and he was at his desk. She started tapping on the screen and when my boyfriend heard this he turned around and called over to the window, \"Please don't touch my window.\"\n\nLater on that day, he was confronted by the neighbor's grown son who insisted that the girl was just looking at the cat and \"wasn't going to touch the window\" (although she already had). Then, this morning, my neighbor herself also confronted my boyfriend and said that the girl \"just liked cats,\" to which my boyfriend replied, \"I understand and I like cats too, but I wouldn't go up to someone's window with a cat in it and start tapping on it. It's my apartment and I don't want people tapping on my window.\" He also explained how I was in there trying to study.\n\nMy neighbor's response to this was to give a weird chuckle and say, \"How neighborly.\" After her comment she then walked away, leaving my boyfriend and I wondering, are we the assholes for not wanting people coming up to our window, standing at it, tapping on it, etc.?\n\ntl;dr: My boyfriend politely asked my neighbor's younger family member to not touch our window (which she did because our cat was sitting in it);  my neighbor has implied with a well-placed comment that she thinks we're assholes for not feeling comfortable with people tapping on our window.

Oh, I feel for you! My son's dorm is on the first floor and faces the foot path between the school's cafeteria and the rest of the dorms, parking, hangout places, etc. He experienced this very thing this year with people knocking (not tapping) on his window as they passed by (to get to his door, you have to have keycard entry to the physical building). \n\nThe placement of the bed is right under the window, and he has been startled awake way too many times by people at all hours. They're not looking for a cat; they're looking for him. He has a love/hate relationship with the placement of his window! People who know him and who give a damn won't knock on the window now, but if someone's been drinking or whatever, forget it. \n\nHe has a bunch of stuff that he hangs in his window, but pretty much he's told people if his light is off, don't knock. Blows me away that your neighbors can't recognize that while yes, there's a cute cat in the window, there are PEOPLE in there, too.", "NTA for standing your ground, even if she doesn't considers it neighbourly. I would recommend placing some sort of small sign on the window \"Please don't tap\" or something, maybe it will make people not do it as much.", "NTA. This is about boundaries and it would be great if people were less offended when taught about them.", "NTA. If the neighbor girl doesn't stop, I'd say start tapping THEIR windows.", "NTA.\n\nI\u2019d jump a foot in the air if I were trying to concentrate and someone did that.", "NTA \n\nShe weirdly chuckled because she knows you are right and she failed to teach her child boundaries and basic respect so she had nothing to say. It doesn\u2019t matter, I too love larger cities, in small town people are so bored they make a big deal out of *everything*.", "NTA. Try putting a note on the window \u201cplease do not disturb the cat\u201d", "Nta\n\nSquirt bottles work for training cats, see how well it works on people that tap your window lol.", "Absolutely NTA.

When asked, tell them that you like to look at adults in their natural habitats.", "Wtf, no NTA. I coo at ground floor window cats if I see them. I don\u2019t start tapping on the glass like it\u2019s a fucking fish tank. Nobody needs to be touching your shit.", "nta, this would really freak me out!  you and your boyfriend didn\u2019t yell at teh little girl or anything, so you guys are completely justified in not wanting your neighbors to tap on your window.  who even does that???", "[deleted]", "NTA. She and her parents probably go to the zoo and tap the cages of the animals and the glass of the aquariums. Not OK.", "NTA. It's weird to tap on someone's window, and it's even weirder to make a big stink about it when they ask you to stop.", "NTA - Regardless of where you live, it is never acceptable to tap on somone's window.", "NTA. If you can and depending on where you are, add some hedges or better, cactus, in front of the window. The cat can still see out but it will keep people from being able to come up to the window.", "NTA.\n\nIf you have a spray bottle you use to keep the cat out of trouble, just put it by the window and give nosy neighbors a little spritz when they peek inside or knock. If they whine about it, tell them, \"We've been trying to teach the cat good manners. We didn't realize so many of the humans around here need help with that, too.\"", "I definitely can sympathize with the love/hate aspect. I don't normally mind my neighbors coming up to the window, in fact our neighbor who lives on our other side is regularly out front, it's just the tapping that gets me. You're absolutely right that I don't think people realize it's not just about the cat. I know I was raised in a very different environment but I would be mortified to come up to someone's window (especially someone I didn't know) and start tapping when they're right on the other side.", "I've considered placing a sign especially now but I don't want to make a bad situation worse and I'm afraid at this point that if a sign goes up my neighbor will take it personally. I might wait a bit for things to die down and then put up a friendly one like \"enjoy the cat but please don't tap!\" or something like that. I really don't mind people coming up, I'm familiar with most of my neighbors, it's just the tapping that bugs me.", "I've noticed that. This was such a minor interaction but I have a feeling it's going to be this week's gossip. Ah, well.", "Yes but make it about how you'd like privacy and don't want strangers looking into your house or something like that. It's so creepy for people to look into your home like that. Since they don't have common sense, you have to spell it out for them.", "It's stated in the post that they only let the cat sit in the open window when they're also in the room. I understand your anxiety, but it's very normal to let cats sit in a window, and they're taking reasonable precautions.", "The girl was approximately 13-15 years old, our cat is spayed, and where I sit to study is directly under the screned-in window which I do not leave opened if I am not in the room, having grown up in a much larger and much more dangerous area (old habits die hard).", "Right? It's one thing if your blinds or curtains are open, you're visible, and they wave to you. Completely wrong for people to just tap or knock on the window.  \n\nYou're definitely within your rights to ask the neighbor to be respectful of your property. Some people with kids take every single offense to being told that their child has done something that needs to be corrected, even if it's minor. And that little girl was likely just interested in the cat without thinking that it was going to bother you. That's normal. She's young! She probably wouldn't think about that aspect at all! The adults, however; that's a different story. Good luck with them!", "Spiky plant in a planter under the window?", "Get some window mirror film.", "Yeah, you have to remember that the world is big and people ain\u2019t shit lol only way to get through the gossip"]}
