That this is harassment and if they push the issue you will be forced to do the same. People don\u2019t just go around patting people\u2019s bellies and assuming pregnancy.

So this seems like it is EXTREMELY out of the norm in any situation.  Like I could maybe see getting you a small going away gift or a small going away party, but $1000 collection seems over the top. \n\nI kind of feel like you knew *something* was off here, and just chose to ignore it.  \n\nAnd putting myself in the shoes of your coworkers, if I was told I was chipping in for someone's baby, and they were never pregnant, I'd be pissed. \n\nI suppose there is a way to explain this away.

Even if you *know* someone is pregnant you wait until an official announcement to congratulate them publicly.", "Sorry, there was a word count limit and I write stream of conscious so bits that were clear to me got left out. \n\nI am still on payroll. About once every three months, the boss sends me an email with a project request. If I'm not busy, I create the thing he needs, then send it and the hours I worked to him.

But then I tend to be overly cautious so this sounds reasonable. LOL", "So how do you know 'your fatness' and such is now the hot office gossip?", "Here's the issue.  You accepted 1000 dollars which is a lot of money.  Surely this wasn't a common occurrence at your place of work - collect a large amount of money for someone quitting their job.  \n\nIt seems really odd you wouldn't question why collection had been made, especially since the card now appears off to you. \n\nAnd it's really extremely odd to take that money and not leave the company.

HR is also not the one who started up the fund, that was a coworker from my department who I worked with. I just didn't use names because I couldn't come up with a fake one off the top of my head. But HR is also a lady, and her phonecall was of the \"hey, headsup about this\" than it was scolding me. I'm still pretty mortified about it, but I don't think HR lady was being malicious or going over any sort of professional line.\n\nThe order of events of me \"quitting\" went something like: the first week of December, I tell boss I'm leaving at the end of January. He submits the paperwork for that. For all of December, I tell coworkers that I'll be quitting, starting my own business doing roughly the same thing, but online. I give updates along the way as to how progress is going all through December. Everyone in the office is excited for me and the progress I am making on setting up my website (which is much different than creating geocites pages, ha). January, we start getting news about covid and nobody really knows what's happening there. Somewhere in the middle of January, boss asks if I would mind staying on payroll because there's one very specific aspect of the job that I do that nobody else in my department is trained for, and asking me to do that thing would be easier than training or hiring someone new specifically for that thing. I agree to stick on for that, and boss updates the paperwork to say \"never mind! OP isn't actually quitting, she's just working on a as-needed basis.\" I don't think I told anyone in the office about this? Because in my mind I was still quitting. I may have told people though, I do not remember. And obviously, coworker heard me, so she knew. As far as I remember, the conversation in January was just a lot of \"what's this silly little covid thing? It's probably nothing, it's not like it's going to \\*massively effect every aspect of our lives for the next three years\\*\"\n\nThen, in the last week of January, CEO announces we won't be doing parties and such anymore until they know what's up with covid, and I pick up the card from my desk as I'm heading out on my last day being bummed about the lack of cake haha.\n\nMe and husband move in March 2020, right as the entire state is being shut down.

I use the money to help pay for the whole moving costs, and that's pretty much the last I ever think about it until this morning.\n\nI do feel kinda silly now, looking back like \"wtf why would my coworkers actually give me this much money?\" but I think at the time I was just more feeling appreciated and that they were really going to miss me and were really excited for me going and doing my own thing, so I didn't really question it.
