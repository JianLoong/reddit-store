You know what happens when you assume", "I thought it was weird they gave you $1000 because you were leaving the company hahaha. I guess it makes more sense cuz they thought they were like baby showering you.", "Aw, NTA! They gave you the money years ago. It's not your fault that they made an assumption and never spoke to you about it. The ex-coworker is actually the AH for going to work and gossiping about this! And the HR person is the AH for having the audacity to call you requesting the money back. What is wrong with people??!!", "That is a ridiculous request. It was a *gift* based on an incorrect assumption they never bothered actually confirming. Sounds like your former co-worker is hard up for cash and is looking for anyone to squeeze. \n\nNTA.", "NTA. This woman at work made an incorrect assumption. That's her fault, not yours. Don't give them any money.", "Grrl, you are so NTA. your old job seems like a gathering of shitty people. A) how fucking rude to judge someone's body & assume they are pregnant, like you said, without even asking you about it first! & B) you don't give a gift & then ask for it back when you feel that it isn't being used for what you intended. \n\nomgosh I'm so upset for you. no one deserves to be made to feel uncomfortable in their own skin... we've all got something that makes us self conscious... wish it was easier to not give any fucks.", "NTA. They're being so gross and invasive about your personal life, I usually wouldn't condone this but you should consider telling them you were pregnant and lost the baby. They should feel like shit for assuming you were pregnant AND for asking for a gift back but they don't, so I don't see an issue with another lie.", "Well, didn't you work with some lovemy people/s.\n\nI'm can't believe that someone has asked for money back after such a long time over, what appears to be, their misunderstanding. And to compound the embarrassment by going to HR (face palm). NTA", "NTA \n\nThat\u2019s the most ridiculous request I\u2019ve read in a minute", "NTA - Co-workers fatal mistakes: Never assume someone is pregnant. Don't give away money expecting you can get it back. Don't get involved in a land war in Asia... oh wait, maybe they didnt do that last one.", "INFO\n\nYou still work there or not? \n\nThis isn't making sense to me. Either you left or you didn't. You moved far away but are now right back in the office?", "NTA - I wouldn't return a single penny. They made an assumption and they did it 3 years ago. Your former boss needs to step up here. Also, I'm willing to bet that some of the people who contributed to that *going away* gift don't even work there any longer.\n\nHonestly they should be ashamed for even asking. Don't let them make you feel badly about your body. People are so stupid when it comes to assuming women are pregnant. And worse! Touching their bellies.", "NTA.  \n\n\nAnd no, you don't have to  return the money.    \n\n\nI am filled with a mixture of sympathy with you and rage at your silly co-workers.", "NTA.  it was a gift, and its rarely appropriate to ask for gifts back.  this is not one of those times", "NTA, don't return the money obviously lol\n\nThem asking for it to be returned (and the way they did) is frankly disgusting, you didn't trick anyone and you're not responsible for their assumptions", "Nta\n\nYou did nothing wrong but your coworker sure did. At no time did you tell or hint that you were pregnant. This person heard part of a conversation and assumed the rest. She\u2019s at fault.  When the gift was given it was not given with an explanation. \n\nThis whole situation was created by the stupidity of one person and it is not you.", "NTA at all. This is wild.", "NTA.", "NTA\n\nGirl, go you do you whatever you do when you need a good pampering. You've earned it.\n\nReply along your lines of never did I ever suggest I even wanted children. Making assumptions about fat women is an expensive mistake.", "NTA. I wouldn't give it back! They're being AHs and bodyshaming you.", "NTA\n\nI'm so sorry you're going through this. It must be a horrible feeling. I can't even believe the audacity of these people. You don't owe them anything. If they want their money back, let your boss or HR reimburse them. \nI think you're amazing for how you're handling the situation.", "NTA, they are. The body shaming here is disgusting and i'm sorry you feel this way. The money was a GOING AWAY GIFT, too bad they assumed you were preggo. They fucked up, not you, so i'd keep it. After this shitty experience, maybe use it to do/ buy things you enjoy.", "What the fuck did I just read \n\nImagine making that kind of assumption and then behaving like this after the fact \n\nYou\u2019re NTA but by Christ they are", "NTA Seems like a sick life hack tbh, I'm gonna try it. Could be tough tho cuz my beard is going to give me away", "NTA.\n\nYour coworkers are idiots. They gave you $1000 for a baby they didn't even try to make sure *existed*.", "Do not give the money back. NTA", "NTA, Shame on HR for making assumptions. They should be fired for what they did. You can't automatically put someone on maternity leave with out signed documents. Jeesh...some people!", "OMG, what a doozy situation and utterly mortifying \ud83d\ude2c You're most definitely NTA and should not return the gift. If anything, they owe you more cash for therapy to get over this mess!\n\nP.S. in case this situation escalates, don't delete any messages from them and document every interaction going forward!", "NTA. Consider it payment for your distress and embarrassment.", "NTA  \n\nWho are these people? The lack of etiquette, manners, simple social mores. They should make another collection just for being idiots. \n\nAdditionally, I\u2019m so sorry you are in this situation. You have zero reason to return the money or even reply to the message. If you feel like you need to reply tell them that you never said anything about being pregnant and therefore all the culpability is in the HR person who assumed information from nothing. That this is harassment and if they push the issue you will be forced to do the same. People don\u2019t just go around patting people\u2019s bellies and assuming pregnancy. You mentioned that it is due to medication so f those people. You have a strong harassment case without being asked to return the money. That isn\u2019t normal behavior.", "O my god, sorry you have to go through this!\n\nOf course, don't give the money back. It was a gift. It is not your fault that it was based on assumptions. They owe you an apology for their reaction. You don't owe them anything.\n\nNTA.", "NTA. This is legitimately an insane thing for them to ask you. Delete the message and block everyone involved. You've done nothing wrong.", "NTA tell them if they want it back you'll go to the bank, and stop at your local news station to give them a free story. I bet they'll tell you to keep the money.", "Now I want to give away a card that says \"Your sex was successful!\" NTA", "NTA. It is unfair and inappropriate for your former coworkers to demand that you return a gift given to you as a going-away present. Even if the gift was intended as a maternity gift, they did not clarify it at the time, and you did not deceive anyone intentionally. It is not your responsibility to ensure that others understand your physical appearance and to avoid misunderstandings. It is understandable to feel upset and insecure about the situation, but you should not blame yourself or your body for others' inappropriate behavior. If you choose to return the money to avoid any further drama, that is up to you, but you are not obligated to do so.", "Oh, good grief. I hope this is the work of some student who was assigned a writing challenge. If not, it was a gift based on a false asuumption. You can't control what others think and do. If anyone needs to refund the money that the coworkers put together, it's the jerk who got the money from others.\n\nNTA", "YWNBTA. Who in their right mind makes such a massive assumption without mentioning anything? I also find it odd that you didn't question why you were given 1K from your co-workers just because you're leaving the company.", "Lol if I gave someone a gift because I assumed she was pregnant\u2026 and then she ended up not being, the last thing I\u2019d do is ask for that gift back. That\u2019s just rude. As if their assumption is your fault.", "Good God, NTA! That is genuinely so fucked up! They should be absolutely horrified and embarrassed at such a horrendous assumption, but instead this coworker is twisting things to make it seem like you intentionally misled them? \n\nFirst of all, haven't we already agreed as a society to NEVER assume someone is pregnant?? \n\nSecond, even if you did realize it was a babyshower type of card, you're entitled to keep that money just out of the sheer audacity and rudeness of the assumption it was apparently based on. \n\nSo, no, you would not be the asshole here. In fact, if you were to email all the coworkers the facts, I can't imagine they wouldn't be deeply embarrassed too. If they still want their money back, maybe the should look to the organizer of said gift and request it from her.", "YWNBTA \n\nKeep the money and sum it up as karma fining a bunch of nosey/judgemental AH\u2019s.", "I'm going to go a slight YTA. \n\nLook, I've had a lot of professional jobs, and I've seen lots of people move on from companies.    I've never seen a collection of $1000 taken up for someone just leaving the company.  I guess its possible its cultural.  But I'm guessing that isn't the case.   So this seems like it is EXTREMELY out of the norm in any situation.  Like I could maybe see getting you a small going away gift or a small going away party, but $1000 collection seems over the top. \n\nI kind of feel like you knew *something* was off here, and just chose to ignore it.  \n\nAnd putting myself in the shoes of your coworkers, if I was told I was chipping in for someone's baby, and they were never pregnant, I'd be pissed. \n\nI suppose there is a way to explain this away.  But it just seems that, at best, you were willfully ignorant and never thought to quesiton this odd thing because you benefitted from it.", "NTA.  It\u2019s been three years!  How many of your coworkers are even still there?  How can they possibly know who donated what?  HR is just going to pocket the money. \n\nIt\u2019s spent.  It\u2019s gone.  Unless you would just gift $1000, then don\u2019t.  If it gets really bad, I would cry miscarriage and that you were too traumatized to say something earlier.", "NTA. Of course you don\u2019t return a cash gift. Everyone knows that you never assume someone is pregnant unless they are clearly in their last month.", "NTA. Block all of them. Fuck them. You can\u2019t just assume somebody is pregnant and go out buying cards before any announcement. Who does that? Even if you *know* someone is pregnant you wait until an official announcement to congratulate them publicly.", "Sorry, there was a word count limit and I write stream of conscious so bits that were clear to me got left out. \n\nI am still on payroll. About once every three months, the boss sends me an email with a project request. If I'm not busy, I create the thing he needs, then send it and the hours I worked to him. He enters it into payroll, and I get paid. \n\nHowever most of my income now comes from commission work, I consider myself self-employed and no longer \"working\" at my old job for that reason.\n\nI have not been to the office since January 2020. I ran into my old coworker at a grocery store about 5 hours drive from the office.", "Okay, this really made me laugh. Thank you, I needed that right now. <3", "Agreed, except for deleting any messages...they need to be kept for evidence, just in case...", "My problem is, I'm guessing these people were told this, not that they all just assumed it.", "How are the rest of the coworkers assholes? HR went around telling them OP is pregnant.\n\nId be pissed at HR if I were them but its a crappy situation in general for everyone in the crossfire.", "I heard you don't assume until you see parents holding the baby. But then I tend to be overly cautious so this sounds reasonable. LOL", "So how do you know 'your fatness' and such is now the hot office gossip?", "Here's the issue.  You accepted 1000 dollars which is a lot of money.  Surely this wasn't a common occurrence at your place of work - collect a large amount of money for someone quitting their job.  \n\nIt seems really odd you wouldn't question why collection had been made, especially since the card now appears off to you. \n\nAnd it's really extremely odd to take that money and not leave the company. Taking a going away gift and not going away? \n\nThat said the HR person if off their rocker to call you about this.  With that absolutely ridiculous response run from this company.", "Probably sound advice. I'm the type who wants to just delete all communication with someone so I don't think about them again but in this case it's probably not the best course of action.", "If I\u2019m reading correctly the someone who assumed was in HR, right? \nIf that\u2019s the case maybe just respond that this whole thing has also been very embarrassing on you, and that wherever the assumption was made that no one checked with you first. You thought the money was a going away gift, and now it\u2019s gone. You don\u2019t have an obligation to replace.", "Would you ask for the money back though? It was years ago, OP doesn\u2019t say how many people are in the office so we don\u2019t know how much they contributed each but still, is it really worth embarrassing someone like that over some money you put in a card a few years earlier?", "Read the post. She said she was contacted by HR passing on a message from a *different* coworker. It\u2019s the office gossip."]}
