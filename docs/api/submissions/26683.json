Quickly they were inseparable, and I met him a week in after their meeting, as her new boyfriend. He seemed nice, and my friend was happy so I was happy for her, but the speed of it was odd.\n\nA month passes and I get news that they are engaged. I asked her if she was sure they weren\u2019t moving too fast. She says,\n\u201cWhen you know, you know.\u201d\n\nThey set the date for the following summer, and I tried to be supportive, helping her organize the wedding, ignoring my skepticism. I felt I barely knew the guy, so I did some solo researching. This guy had no socials whatsoever, which is fine but surprising. Then I found a facebook profile with his picture but a different name. He had multiple posts with another woman.\nI had to tell my friend what I had found out, so I did.\n\nShe seemed shocked and her face dropped three shades, but she denied that it was him. I didn\u2019t know what to say given the guy in the pictures was identical to the guy she was about to marry. She said I should give it up, and that I was trying to ruin her relationship. \nI didn\u2019t say anything, I just left.\n\nHer wedding was a month away when I decided to message the woman tagged in his facebook posts asking her what her business was with him.\nShe messaged back that they\u2019d been dating for four years now, and I told her the situation sending the only photo I had of him to assure they were the same guy. She asked for my number and we talked. It was a hundred percent the same guy and she had no idea about any of it. \n\nI tried to talk to my friend about it, but she didn\u2019t want to hear.\n\nThe wedding rolls around and i feel awful. I cant help but think my friend is marrying a cheater and a liar and will ultimately end up in the same situation as the girlfriend. But, it\u2019s her big day and I have to pretend to be supportive.\n\nThe vows are being exchanged, when suddenly the girlfriend bursts in cursing and screaming at the groom.\n\nHe calls off the wedding. I try to console my friend, telling her I didn\u2019t expect the girl to show up.\n\nMy friend caught on that I had texted with her and blamed me for crashing her wedding.\n\nI didnt intend for the girl to show up let alone make the groom call off the wedding, although it was somewhat a relief. I just wanted to protect my friend.", "created_utc": 1694455851, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16g2k73/aita_for_crashing_my_friends_wedding/", "score": 73, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I do want to point out that he called off the wedding instead of telling her to get lost. That's pretty telling. \n\nYour friend was delusional for not addressing this with him before the wedding.

She is the type to be all in or nothing, so it wasn\u2019t unlike her to make strangely haste and ill appointed decisions but I am quite the opposite. She also had a hard time dating throughout her life, not that she fell for the wrong guys all the time, but no one quite caught attention her, I guess. They were seemingly compatible before I found out who he really was, but of course my perception changed of him while hers did not.", "I really didn\u2019t think THAT would happen, I was hoping the gf would confront him BEFORE the wedding, and hopefully open up a conversation about it, but that\u2019s wishful thinking at its best.", "It makes me want to add drama to my life\u2026 and that\u2019s a bad thing at my age \ud83d\ude02", "I will absolutely have to use this in the future.  \"Room temperature IQ's\"", "I told her that there was going to be a wedding that summer, nothing too in depth.

I need some clarification on that point.", "I guess I didn\u2019t think giving the date was intention for the wedding to be crashed, I more or less was egging on a conversation to happen before my friend was tied to this man. I couldn\u2019t lie to say I wasn\u2019t a relieved that the wedding was off although the blame landed on me for contacting the girlfriend in the first place. Ultimately I didn\u2019t want my friend married to a cheater, and this was probably the worst way that outcome could have happened.", "I wonder if she knew, and was trying to move from being the other woman to the wife with a husband and his mistress. \n\nNTA, I'm a bit idealistic so I would have hoped the confrontation was before the wedding too. You approached this exactly as you should.\n\nWhat happens now is more important though. I know this friend is important to you, but I encourage you to step back and examine your relationship. Ask yourself hard questions like whether she has more responsibility in this than you'd like to admit. If she was truly shocked by the information, wouldn't she be blaming the girlfriend or her fiance? Denial is powerful and she could be denying the truth to herself and be at no fault here. But you owe it yourself to examine the relationship and make sure it's still as healthy for you now as it was when you met.", "Again, you\u2019re my hero, but I have to ask:  how did gf get the date, time, and location? \ud83d\ude09", "Also - we need the update as to what happened after gf stormed the ceremony.  All details would be much appreciated. \ud83d\ude02", "Either way - it\u2019s super interesting that she\u2019s mad at you for her fianc\u00e9 being a scoundrel and ruining his own wedding because of his current sexing of another woman? \ud83d\ude02", "She knew the date of the wedding and his last name. Pretty easy to call around to places and find out where it is. Sorry buddy, her ability to crash the wedding is on you for giving her the exact date.", "Wedding website?", "Still NTA. Dirty John\u2019s gonna have to find a new mark.", "you\u2019re right, I didn\u2019t think about this when giving it to her, but ultimately I wanted someone to do something to confront the cheater, which happened in the end", "Most of these are private nowadays (with invite only info).  Me thinks this dude definitely wasn\u2019t publishing this info. \ud83d\ude02", "Hmmm, good point. Then again, this dude doesn't seem terribly bright, so might be a coin toss"]}
