But I would be lying if I said I wasn\u2019t completely fed up with it. \n\nMy personal feelings and frustrations aside, she is now in her 70s and has a number of health problems, including arthritis, incontinence, and mobility issues.

We also know that she refuses to do anything for herself and wants everyone to do everything for her, as we\u2019ve witnessed it over and over again.

I understand dementia can look like manipulation in the early stages. If she does have it, she\u2019ll need to go into a care facility.\n\nToday, we got into an argument because she first told me that she knew I was busy but I \u201cneeded to call her right now and get things squared away for her.\u201d Then she told me I \u201cneeded to buy her a futon and put it in our basement because she\u2019s coming to live with us.\u201d I told her no and explained that we\u2019ve talked about this numerous times, and she whipped out her favorite guilt-trip \u2013 \u201cafter everything I\u2019ve done for you, you can\u2019t take care of me?

She will never leave once she gets a foot in the door. Keep saying no. If she calls and starts talking about living with you, tell her no, it's not happening and hang up.\n\nAs for \"everything I've done for you\"- she chose to have you and it was her responsibility to provide and raise you. Don't compromise your mental health, your marriage or your family for her. If she shows up on your doorstep, don't open the door. Tell her no.", "NTA\n\nPLEASE don\u2019t let her stay. With your child living with you it will stress them out as well. Kids can pick up on tension and anxiety (dogs can too). I know her age might tempt you to let her stay, but narcissists do not and will not change their behavior, and so if your prediction is that if you give her an inch she\u2019ll take a mile, you\u2019re correct. \n\nI would say you should stop arguing with her because narcissists love to argue, my dad picks fights with me just to win them it seems. Not only that but she may use your behavior as leverage against you, despite it being provoked and valid. There\u2019s also a chance letting her stay will put tension on your relationship with your partner, especially considering the size of your home. The truth is that you don\u2019t owe her this either because of her behavior towards your ENTIRE life.\n\nSomething else to keep in mind\u2014a boundary is NOT a boundary if it is not enforced, so don\u2019t let her weasel her way into your life. I applaud you for how civil you are with her, it\u2019s not so easy for me. You sound like an empathetic person, narcissists love that quality in people for the wrong reasons. I wish you luck, be safe.", "NTA.\n\nYou repeatedly told her \"no\" in a polite manner. She is either incapable or unwilling to listen. Thus, you ended doing what you should do: say no in increasingly more explicit manner.", "Nope NTA. You've told her many times and now she is trying to bully her way into your home by guilt-tripping. I hate when parents say, \"after all I've done for you\" as if that absolves narcissistic abuse and means you are obligated to still care for them in their older age. Yes, it would be great if your personalities meshed well enough that she can move in with you, but that is not the case. It's every adult's responsibility to think about their retirement.", "Why is she moving to your area? No one moves without having a place to stay.  Except for a narcissist.  She has no intention of looking for a place, and she doesn't have dementia.\n\nYOU ARE HER RETIREMENT PLAN.\n\n And you damn well know it. That's why she is using guilt now.

Yes, you're her daughter but that doesn't mean you owe anything.  She's not respecting your boundaries now. She won't respect them once she has a foot in the door.

If you have children and animals in a small home, adding someone with health and incontinence problems will completely ruin your family dynamics. Moreover, if she's being that pushy when she's trying to sweet talk you into taking her in, you can be rest assured she's going to drop the sweet part and just be demanding. \n\nYou are absolutely right to refuse to house her in your home.", "Are there short-term rental apartments near you?
