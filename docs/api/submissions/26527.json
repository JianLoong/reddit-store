You\u2019re right\u2014 if she doesn\u2019t change, she\u2019ll be an economic burden and leave you much poorer than if you did this on your own. \n\nPeople act like money and love can never be spoken about in the same sentence, but how money is spent is every day of a marriage and a humungous part of whether you\u2019re happy and comfortable or not. \n\nAs she is now, you\u2019d always be stressed about what she bought, what she\u2019s demanding you buy her next, when she\u2019s going to get another job.

It's also worth adding that financial issues are a relationship killer. The party that can't save money and expects to spend money will be aggravated by the equally pissed off more frugal party.\n\n>I love my girlfriend and want to live with her, but i dont think i should be funding her living situation while she spends her money irresponsibly. \n\nBecause you shouldn't be. Don't get me wrong, there are some scenarios where this is relaxed like if she was disabled, or if you mutually agreed for her to become a stay at home mom, or even a house wife. However, it sounds like living with her would be a give and zero take relationship. She'd be spending money she doesn't have and you'd be bailing her out.\n\n>She gets upset and angry with me and tells me she cant afford it and that i dont love her or really dont want to live with her.\n\nBe very careful here OP. What she said was a red flag, because her response to your legitimate concern and expectations was to essentially guilt trip you and accuse you of not actually loving her if you weren't willing to allow love to matter more than fiscal responsibility. It's possible she just has an immature infatuation with the concept of \"love conquering all\", but I'd say it's more likely she's being manipulative.\n\nNTA", "NTA. Perfectly reasonable to not want to live with a free loader, no matter how much you like/love them. It's probably going to be a tough conversation, but stay calm and stick to your high ground. Hopefully, once the initial emotional reaction is out of the way, you two can set some (realistic) goals and start working on them together.\n\nMy step dad is a free loader (old family friend, super nice guy, and I like him a lot), and it puts a ton of strain on their marriage. No way you want that, and money skills can be learned if there's enough motivation.", "NTA\n\nUntil she starts taking responsibility for herself, GF isn't going to be a good partner.  Don't let her live with you.  And stop giving her money and paying for so much for her.\n\nTell GF, \"I would love to live with you.  But I'm not interested in having a dependent.  Earn your own money, save up enough for your share of the security deposit and first and last month's rent, and be prepared to pay half of rent AND household expenses, and then we'll talk about having you move in.  I'm looking for a partner in life and I hope that can be you.  But you need to learn to be more independent for that to happen.\"", "I think you are making a mistake assuming she will be any different than she is right now.  Not everyone is dating/long term relationship material.  Your girlfriend sounds more like a rental than a long term purchase.", "NTA", "NTA - she wants to live rent free but not with her parents. If she wants to act grown, she\u2019s going to start dealing with both pros and cons of it. Which means working, creating a budget and paying bills.\n\nLive by yourself for awhile first.", "NTA - maybe put off her moving in until she is stable - graduated, stable job, spending under control. You\u2019re at different life stages so having her move in now might not be the best timing.", "I don\u2019t think you guys will be financially compatible", "Reread what you wrote and decide if she\u2019s responsible enough to move in with you because it\u2019s clear she lacks financial and emotional maturity. NTA", "NTA\n\nThere isn't any amount of good sex to keep a hobosexual. If you have doubts now, you'll have a lifetime of regret later. End this before the holidays so you don't gotta buy gifts.", "NTA\nYou'd be taking a huge, and unwise, risk having her move from her parents home to yours without her ever having maintained a responsible budget on her own. There is no reason to expect her to magically change into a reliable responsible adult when she moves in with you when she has never shown the skills or motivation to be fiscally responsible.\n\nLove and romance are important. But emotional attachment does not diminish or erase priorities, needs, goals and boundaries in other important areas. No amount of love will help you recover from giving a financially irresponsible person access to your money and resources. Your frustration and feelings of not being heard and not being respected will grow as she continues to live beyond her means expecting you to foot the bill. \n\nBeing independent and responsible for basics of adulthood should be the baseline requirement for shared housing. She's not pulling her weight now. You'd just replace her parents as her in home ATM.", "Thats not a partner dude, you're taking care of a child and enabling her. Is that the kind of relationship you want?", "Well, the question is-do you want a permanent dependent that will almost certainly always be bad with money? And may, (probably certainly *will*), spend *your* paycheck into oblivion, *too*, if she can get her hands on it.\n\nBut\u2026 you get to have sex with her.
