{"id": 10529, "submission_id": "117wopv", "title": "AITA for taking in my cousin and supporting her, against her parent\u2019s wishes?", "selftext": "This happened recently, but this situation was building up for a while now.\n\nMy cousin Anna (19F) called me (29M) in tears asking if she could stay with me for a while. When I told my wife, she had no hesitation in saying yes, because we both know the situation, and left to go pick Anna up. \n\nThe situation is: for her whole life, Anna has done what her parents want. This includes, how she dresses, when she has to be home, what she studies at uni. It\u2019s caused Anna to be very unhappy with life.\n\nNow, anyone who knows Anna knows the one thing she loves (and is very good at) is cooking. Her parents, have decided that cooking isn\u2019t good enough and forced Anna to go to university. She just finished her first year in 2022, and unsurprisingly, she didn\u2019t do to well, mainly because she didn\u2019t want to be there. When she called me, she had a massive argument with her parents where she said she\u2019s sick of them living through her, and her parents basically told her to leave the house.\n\nWhen Anna got to my place, my wife and I told her she\u2019s welcome to stay with us indefinitely. Honestly, it\u2019s been great because her mood has definitely lifted, and my daughters adore their auntie, and she adores them.\n\nAnna was with us for roughly a week, and then we got a knock at the door. It was my mum and Anna\u2019s mum (sisters). They wanted to talk to Anna, I asked Anna if she wanted me to kick them out, she said it was fine.\n\nSo, there was my mum and aunt, Anna, my wife and myself, discussing what needs to be done about Anna. Before anyone said anything, I asked Anna, what does she want to do. She told everyone, she wants to take culinary classes and find work at a restaurant. My aunt said that while Anna lived under her roof that would not be happening. My wife and I said basically simultaneously, under our roof she can do that. \n\nMy mum then asks us if we\u2019re really going to insert ourselves into someone else\u2019s family business, and I said of course, especially after Anna called us crying. I said I\u2019ve seen Anna be unhappy for years, and now she finally has a chance to be herself. \n\nMy aunt warns Anna if she doesn\u2019t change her attitude she isn\u2019t welcome back home. And this is her final chance. Anna starts to cry and says this past week she\u2019s been the happiest she\u2019s ever been and she doesn\u2019t want to leave. My aunt looks at my wife and asks if she really wants Anna living with her. She tells her, we have a spare bedroom with an ensuite, we make more than enough money to send Anna to culinary school, and our kids love having Anna here. I chime and say our house is bigger, cleaner and in a much better location than my aunts house, and I make much more money than my aunt and uncle, so Anna is really getting a nice upgrade.\n\nMy aunt gets up and says she doesn\u2019t need to listen to my disrespect, and my mum says that was uncalled for, but I tell my mum we all know I\u2019m right.\n\nSo, AITA for taking in my cousin in this situation?", "created_utc": 1676961331, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/117wopv/aita_for_taking_in_my_cousin_and_supporting_her/", "score": 171, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your last comments were a bit much, but I am loving it lol. Also if she doesn't need to listen to your disrespect she can just leave and not listen to it, easy peasy.", "So first off, your mom\u2019s right in that you shouldn\u2019t have just gone into full attack mode against your aunt. Keeping calm clearly isn\u2019t her thing so it should be yours.\nHowever. I remember my mom continuously telling me \u201cas long as you live under my roof, you do whatever I say\u201d. And I\u2019m sorry but there\u2019s a HUGE difference between this and the \u201cmy roof, my rules\u201d situation. The first one is something that control freak people use as a justification for limiting others to the point where the only option is to actually move out. Where conflicts are not about who does chores, who pays what bills, etc.. But where the living conditions don\u2019t matter because the house technically becomes a prison/living hell - unless you do whatever you\u2019re told to. And that goes for chores, limiting who you can see, where you can go and how long for, these kinda things.\nSeemingly, Anna is a respectful person that asked you first if it was okay with you. She didn\u2019t just show up at your doorstep, with a bunch of bags and went \u201cI\u2019m staying with you\u201d, with an attitude.\nYou didn\u2019t keep calling and checking on her if she wanted to move out yet, it was her decision and call. Only people, that don\u2019t respect Anna and an individual grownup, would think you \u201cinterjected\u201d yourself between people. Anna\u2019s parents need to open their eyes and understand that respect isn\u2019t a one way street and being the parents of a person doesn\u2019t just give them an ultimate lifetime pass.", "Well... you are NTA for taking in your cousin, that was very kind and it sounds like a better situation for her.  But YTA for being petty and telling your aunt you have more money and a nicer house because that is not the point and it is not why Anna is with you.  You just made a difficult situation a lot worse and have now made it very easy for your Aunt to call you the bad guy in the situation.", "NTA, but with the caveat that you behaved like one with the \"I'm better than you because, well, money\" bit. The problem with Anna's parents isn't how much money they do or don't have. The problem is that they're unwilling to accept that she has her own goals and dreams and that they're not at all supportive of her following *her* dreams. It doesn't take money to do that. Money is handy but it means nothing compared to having loving support. THAT is what you and your wife have to offer her. THAT is what she wasn't being given by her parents. THAT is what she needs the most. You've done a good thing... Don't taint it by behaving like a snob because you have more money. That's a shit example to say, not just for Anna, but for your own children as well. Be better.", "NTA \n\nIn fact, you and your wife are heros. Cut the evil sisters out of your life if they can't act decently.", "You are NTA. You are an amazing uncle. Your niece is 19 years old, old enough to choose her own path and passion in her life. You weren't being disrespectful either. You were being logical and supportive of your niece. You were respectful when you allowed her in your home to have her say.

Your cousin is very lucky to have family that love her like parents are supposed to, since her parents are duds\u2026.", "NTA. You and your wife are saints.

I met one of my best friends when we started nursing school together. She decided that nursing wasn't for her. Eventually she went to the French culinary institute in Manhattan.

It kinda showed who you are. Why do you have to go so low just to bring a point across. What your wife said was enough to make it clear to your sister that your niece is better off with you guys.

WOOHOO!!!!", "Nah fuck 'em. The high road is just a way to feel morally superior and that's it.\n\nThey do not deserve OP pulling punches, not after what they've already done and said.\n\nClear as day NTA.", "I go low because it was justified, games the game", "NTA for sticking up for his niece, but the way stuff was said was uncalled for.", "Lol, I don't lose my manners just because others do. I was abused by my parents but I don't want to be low lifes like them so I don't behave that way. I didn't say he was an A H for everything else. What he did was amazing and it still doesn't change that he indeed was an A H when he said it.\n\nEdit: bringing in you have more money and a bigger house doesn't adress the abuse and the things his wife said made it clear already that they can financially support the niece.", "Because you justify it. In the end it's your thing but you're asking people about their opinion on what you did and this is mine.", "ooooohhh your such an AH for calling your parents lowlifes"]}
