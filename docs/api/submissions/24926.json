{"id": 24926, "submission_id": "15uhoz7", "title": "AITA for refusing to do someone's shopping for them??", "selftext": "First post here goes... I work in a tiny local shop in my town and a while ago a teenager (15 or 16yo)poked his head through the door. He had a dog with him but he didn't want to tie the dog up outside, so he asked me to get a few things for him so I did. I wasn't busy at the time so why not? He got maybe five or six things so I put it all into a bag for him, rounded the counter to give him the bag, took his money back to the till and come back out to give his change all while he was waiting half in half out. I didn't say anything to him that time.\n\nYesterday he came back and asked again for me to get something for him. Except this time I had just had a delivery of stock to put away. (It's just me in the shop) I told him he could tie up the dog outside if he wants or take the dog home first since most of our customers live very close by and we have a no dogs allowed policy. But again, I got his stuff for him. I want to say that many of our customers come with their dogs and tie them up near the trash can or the fence and most of the time I can actually still see the dog on the CCTV.\n\nSo today a lady comes to the shop, I've seen her before she's somewhat a regular. She asked, \"What happened yesterday? The boy with the dog?\" I was confused at first because I didnt remember any drama like that, but then I realized what she was talking about. I told her what I had said and she starts with \"That was my SON\" and berating me about how could she leave her dog out there when it might get stolen!? I don't like confrontation, I don't think I even looked her in the eye once during her tirade. \"Would you leave your dog tied up outside!?\" I tell her I don't have a dog. \"See!\" She tells like my not having a dog at makes her right. She then tells me the usual, \"I'm never shopping here again! Your customer service is terrible\" and leaves with a \"I hope you DON'T get a dog!\" As her parting repartee. So. Here I am. Without dog. But with job. Which I'm starting to hate a little bit more every day. Because I know we're not a perfect town but Madam, mothers have left their entire children in their strollers outside while they came in to shop. You would be hard pressed to spend more than 10 minutes shopping in such a tiny place. I can see the entire front of the shop outside on the CCTV. I don't mind helping customers it is part of my job but it's not my job to get all your stuff while you wait outside with your dog??
