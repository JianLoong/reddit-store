It was part of the \u201cexperience \u201c, kids are kids I might be woken up early but these are rare short time in their lives, Ill wake up tired and spend the time with them.\n\nEspecially if its few and far between.\n\nBut if sleep and your vacation is more important, you do you. The kids might be bummed and feel hurt, parents feel shamed and bad, it does make things weird. But again different kind of person, I am not that type and still say yta for reasons listed.", "So being a different kind of person than you is the same as being an asshole?", "I don\u2019t do it myself because yeah, I feel I would be an asshole. I listed reasons on why, makes the kids, their parents, and others in the situation offended/ irritated etc. so I personally don\u2019t do it.\n\nI would be an asshole if I did it, so agree others who do it are assholes too.\n\nNot catching me here, same opinion either way, and main reason I buck ip and deal. I don\u2019t want to be an asshole. \n\nBe different than me all you want, I am absolutely the asshole on somethings my opposites are not."]}
