You were doing your grandparents a favour. You aren't honor-bound to their estate!", "NTA It was a favor to your grandparents.

You're aunts and uncles can choose to pay you or pay someone else, but your favor to your grandparents was not extended to them.", "NTA you can charge whatever you like. It\u2019s up to them to determine if they want your services for the price you charge. \n\nI get annoyed with people who insist they get a deal at someone else\u2019s expense - and somehow that person being screwed over is the asshole. \n\nBtw that was very kind of you to do that favor for your grandparents. \ud83d\udc95\ud83d\udc95", "NTA, you gave them a discount and I would assume you're not as close to your aunt and uncle as you were your grandparents.\n\nYou were doing your grandparents a favor and it sounds like a lot of mowing.. almost 4 acres. It's a huge time commitment. The favor was for your grandparents, doesn't carry over as part of the deal on the property.", "NTA\n\nYou are doing a favor, doesn\u2019t mean everyone is entitled to that favor.  It aunt/uncle keeps causing issues, I should just stop cutting their lawn because who knows what other issues they might cause in the future.  Like not paying, complaining about the work you do or make other demands.", "NTA", "NTA - Had a similar situation myself but you've handled it better than me. You did all the steps of getting other quotes, and still helped them out so it's up to them to sort it", "INFO; do you do professional lawn care? it\u2019s not just mowing you pay a service for\u2026 are you doing all the other tasks as well?", "NTA at all. You did it because you loved them.", "Info needed: Are you trained in lawn care? Could/would you be providing the exact same services as a professional? If you're as skilled as a professional, then you charging a little less than the going rate is understandable. If you're not trained or skilled, and all you're doing is mowing the lawn, then you would be charging an excessive amount for no where near the same results as a professional. Also, most lawn care companies send out at least two, if not more people, and charge that larger price to pay for all associates working the job. Definitely need more info to make the judgement.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.
