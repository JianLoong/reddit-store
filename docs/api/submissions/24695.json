(You mention she was keeping that news on the DL.) Or did she think one of her bridesmaids showed up to the wedding ill or hungover and was throwing up in the bridal suite while everyone was getting ready? That's a key point.\n\nFor seating, why in the world did your family bother the bride at the actual wedding about seating? She's hosting large numbers of people on a pressure filled day and it's not cool to bug her about the best man's spouse's seating. If you had to bother someone, you should have asked your son to handle it. Newsflash though: sometimes there is only enough room at the front table for the actual wedding party and their spouse being seated with cousins was not a slight, but simply a logistics issue. I've been a bridesmaid oodles of times and not had my husband or partner at the head table with me because a venue was small or that's just how the couple wanted it. I never bugged the couple, never threw a fit and left, or held a grudge about it. I had a good time texting my partner updates from the front and he let me know the breaking news at his table, and then we sat together once all the toasts were over and had a great time. Your family/the best man sounds like drama. Weddings are complicated events and it's really low class to have a tantrum about a seating assignment DURING THE RECEPTION AND INVOLVE THE BRIDE. \n\nAs to being unsympathetic about the miscarriage: yup, will give Debbie the AH vote for that.", "NTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
