She's hosting large numbers of people on a pressure filled day and it's not cool to bug her about the best man's spouse's seating. If you had to bother someone, you should have asked your son to handle it. Newsflash though: sometimes there is only enough room at the front table for the actual wedding party and their spouse being seated with cousins was not a slight, but simply a logistics issue. I've been a bridesmaid oodles of times and not had my husband or partner at the head table with me because a venue was small or that's just how the couple wanted it. I never bugged the couple, never threw a fit and left, or held a grudge about it. I had a good time texting my partner updates from the front and he let me know the breaking news at his table, and then we sat together once all the toasts were over and had a great time. Your family/the best man sounds like drama.

Since they're clearly not as important as your other bones.", "How old was she at the time? What was her explanation for her \u201cneed\u201d?", "I was a witness and she was with me the whole time. Yes, that\u2019s my shovel and truck.", "Love how you aren't even saying in case they get a divorce and straight fortune telling \"after the divorce\" lol", "This whole family is good people.  Let me know if they need an extra sister!", "She was 16. Her 'need' was that her hip would \"grind or pop\" when she walked (she doesn't really take care of herself) so the obvious answer was to take away the wheelchair from the kid who got squashed under a tractor tire and a rafter.", "I just don\u2019t understand coming to AITA and spinning every single action in the post in the other direction. You can always say, \u201cbut what if it happened this way\u201d or \u201cwhat if OP is lying\u201d or \u201cthink about it from their perspective\u201d or even make up a bunch of events that didn\u2019t happen and were never referenced to. Are you personally involved in this situation to be calling the sister needy? Nothing in the post indicates this", "Exactly.  If you don't do what OP has done, you are going to lose three other children and their spouses.\n\nIt doesn't make it feel any better but you don't sacrifice everyone else for someone who's actually quite nasty.  And has shown herself as that.", "I have been in the wife's shoes, and hubby has as well. \n\nI was sat with our social circle until hubby's duties were done then he joined us (they only had the bride and groom at the top table and bridal party were seated closest to the top table but still with the guests.\n\nHubby was sat with people the same age as us that he had interacted with at events in the past as well as at the table next to, so he was back to back with the brides mum who is kinda like his unofficial MIL cause the bride and I are close but there wasn't room at \"mums\" table for him. He had fun, and we were only apart for the eating portion and speeches any way.\n\nFor Debbie to single out the best man's wife because she isn't blood family is disgusting, especially considering she has been a part of the grooms family longer than Debbie.", "It is just an interesting perspective. OP might have clarified after my comment but at the time it was very unclear if the daughter in law knew.\n\nI also find it best to try and see all perspectives before judging people. I think a lot of people on this sub just want an excuse to be an ass hole, they want a villain.\n\nIt is also funny how paranoid people are. Do you have any idea how many different posts people have accused me of being their chosen villain in because I didn\u2019t jump on the internet hate bandwagon? Why bother to post if you agree with everything said? Just upvote and move on.", "Oh well that makes sense. And thank you. So much. Children can break your heart. It all worked out in the end though.", "While Debbie\u2019s behavior is embarrassing YTA as you waited until the day of your son\u2019s wedding to blow up the family!  Surely there where signs you ignored and if not and this was a once off then man YTA x 1 million!  This is the way you want your son to start a life with his wife and adding this stress.\n\nI don\u2019t care if you hate Debbie but think of your son.  You\u2019re a selfish asshat for doing this to him.\n\nIf you were the piece keeper then you say it was a bad moment in a stressful situation and perhaps she didn\u2019t know how to act.  Maybe you privately take her aside and explain how you and the family felt.\n\nInstead you threw gasoline on then fire then jet fuel!\n\nSMH", "I know a chick with BPD and she has done the exact same thing.", "It should be higher up that she thought a MISCARRIAGE was \u201ctaking attention off her.\u201d\n\nThat right there speaks volumes.", "Good point. Also hard to believe someone would use a miscarriage as taking attention away from their honeymoon  - I get it that Debbie has been awful, this seems a stretch.  Did Debbie text her husband\u2019s family making this declaration? Certainly Neil didnt tell his family if she did say this. This part of the story doesnt add up.", "Reading would help you with all your questions.\nNo the pregnancy was never announced. Debbie just treated her horribly for being pregnant. (Only immediate family knew before and during the wedding)\nThe miscarriage was in a family chat.\nAnd the other DIL was seated in the back with random guests as bride did not consider her family and she was not allowed to set with the other non bridal party family.", "No. Nice try. Debbie is God awful. Please tell me a good excuse for thinking a miscarriage is attention seeking. That one thing alond gets her excluded. She showed who she was.", "Yea I want to know how the attention seeking comment somehow got back to the OP here.", "They were texted on their honeymoon by a group text. It\u2019s not clear if Debbie was in the text or just the son. OP is vague on the details.", "\"I appreciate you finally taking everyone's feelings seriously, thank you,\"  would work just fine", "They texted them but somehow found out Debbie thought it was attention seeking? Are they implying she wrote that in the family group chat? That seems\u2026.unlikely.", "Yeah, I really envy the people that have never had to witness/deal with this type of person. I unfortunately have and it's not fun. Had a relative who was similar but also an alcoholic, which just ups the ante. These people have always existed. There is just now a more public platform for their existence to be known. I'm not surprised by most of these stories because I grew up with such a dysfunctional family.", "Same... several women in my family suffered miscarriages (Mom, MIL's, SIL, etc.), so if I found out the same thing, I'd be in prison, but also be liable and probably paying lots of medical bills. Because if left alive, no amount of plastic surgery from the best surgeons on the goddamn planet could undo what I had done", "I\u2019m so sorry. Those first few months after are so hard. Hang in there", "Ooooh ouch -she deserves it, tho!", "Agreed. There\u2019s a reason OP left it out of the original post and it\u2019s in a comment buried somewhere. It was unnecessary to bother them with this sad news on their honeymoon. The news absolutely could have waited till they returned home.", "If you haven\u2019t seen it check out Killer Psyche. It\u2019s done but a former FBI agent who was trained in profiling, who was originally a psych nurse before joining fbi. She\u2019s excellent.

He must be as bad as she is.", "I know,  right? Does Debbie think the daughter CHOSE to miscarry ?", "How do people like that get married!?", "Remembering back to being on a honeymoon, the last thing I would want was to be a center of attention for anybody but my new wife.", "When I was 11 (F) my family found out that I had been cutting myself from a student who told their parents they\u2019d seen something on me while changing for gym class. My sister (17F at the time) told my parents that I told her I was only doing it for attention. I had been SA and my tiny brain was trying to figure out how to die one night. I was not looking for attention and I\u2019m not 30. Reading these made me feel validated.", ">We live, die, go to work, have our own issues, and generally speaking go on with our lives.\n\nI'm certain if someone would have died, Debbie would've thought that was attention seeking too. What a disgusting person.\n\nI don't think he would have gotten half of these words out before Debbie had a tantrum. She sounds like a real piece of work that doesn't like to be criticized in any possible way.", "\u201cThat\u2019ll be the best Christmas present ive gotten in years\u201d", "So many people blindly accept these stories as 100% factual when I call bullshit on parts of most of the AITA posts.

By the time I could fit a spoon into my mouth, the ice cream had been devoured by my ever-so-unloving family.", "Yep. OP seems to have disappeared and isnt filling in the blanks. Probably because his story is slanted a bit to support his opinions.", "The bar is so low you could trip, lol", "Right, the whole point is to fucking take op at their word. I\u2019m sick of \u201cwell what if Debbie is RIGHT\u201d type of shit. Take the post at face value and rule from there.", "YES. \nAnd when she protests, point out that she called mourning the death of a child attention seeking behavior.", "But she put her away from all family because she said that she wasn't imitate family. Her intent was clear. She should have been allowed to sit with the other family not some random guests", "I AM SQUEALING WITH LAUGHTER!!!! BITTER PILL TO SWALLOW HUH DEBS!!!!!", "This. The part about Debbie saying the miscarriage was attention seeking is rubbish - I dont believe this comment was ever made."]}
