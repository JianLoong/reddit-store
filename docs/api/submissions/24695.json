If you had to bother someone, you should have asked your son to handle it. Newsflash though: sometimes there is only enough room at the front table for the actual wedding party and their spouse being seated with cousins was not a slight, but simply a logistics issue. I've been a bridesmaid oodles of times and not had my husband or partner at the head table with me because a venue was small or that's just how the couple wanted it. I never bugged the couple, never threw a fit and left, or held a grudge about it. I had a good time texting my partner updates from the front and he let me know the breaking news at his table, and then we sat together once all the toasts were over and had a great time. Your family/the best man sounds like drama.

He then tried to come back in a couple days later, and my boss looked at him weirdly.  Then said, I thought you were a man of your word.  When the customer claimed he was, boss goes well you said you were never coming back in, and I'm holding you to that statement.", "Omg yessss exactly! \ud83e\udd23 \n\"Sooo can we get that in writing in case you end up wanting to change your mind?\"", "woah there partner", "Was just about to say the same thing. Or at least felony assault.", "If the immediate family already knew she was pregnant, a group text to let them know about the miscarriage would have been helpful so no one would say anything accidently that would be painful.", ">My daughter was super sick from morning sickness and Debbie told her she looked disgusting and stop taking attention off of her. \n\nShe knew.", "Does that matter?", "Sure. Doesn't mean they should just capitulate to her insanity or entitlement. OP should definitely realize at this point that his son is not going to advocate for his family and this is a distinct possibility, though.", "Are you for real? It could just as easily have been food poisoning or a stomach bug, which also wouldn\u2019t be SIL\u2019s fault. One of my bridesmaids WAS hungover while getting ready. You know what I did? Offered her a snack, some water, and some advil. I was grateful my bridesmaids were there, and spending their time and money to celebrate my wedding with me. Yes, it\u2019s your day, but you can also be a f*cking human being.", "There are ways to do that without a group chat. And considering the relationships here, I\u2019m not sure if they should have included Debbie (and maybe son since he seems to be drinking her kool aid) in said group chat in the first place. \n\nBefore we had cell phones and texting options, we still had telephones and could communicate in other forms. \n\nBut really I was remarking on how many of these AITA situations become shitshows in general due to group chats. It\u2019s instant flying monkeys. \n\nI want purely remarking on this post.", "Agree.", "I am sure they covered the pregnancy before the wedding, she was 3 months in. Close families sometimes share pregnancy new right away.", "Why you so invested Debbie", "nope that's not always true.  I facetime with my mother and father atleast once a day for like an hour.  We are as close as close can be and I did not tell anyone except husband until I was showing at 4 months.  You cannot say \"most\" when it comes to pregnancy announcements", "It\u2019s probably Debbie"]}
