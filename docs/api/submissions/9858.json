The whole divorce process did some real damage, financially and emotionally. My son (20sM) had just started college, and as part of the settlement I signed on to take all financial responsibility for college. At first I was going to pay outright, but since money got shifted around in the divorce, I told him to take out loans and I would pay for them as a lump-sum after he graduated (he didn\u2019t qualify for aid because of my salary). After the divorce, I admittedly made some poor dating decisions and had to deal with the fallout of that. That bad relationship and other things have come up over the years, and I began to pay most of the payments starting 6 months ago. Usually my son venmo requests me each month and I send it that way.\n\nHere\u2019s the thing: he has graduated and gotten a great job, and, as of a year ago, earns more than me now. I got cancer a couple of years ago and had to deal with all the bills (the insurance covered it but I had to cover the co-pay). I recovered, thankfully, and have continued to send the monthly payments. My son recently told me that he feels that sending the venmo requests adds to the stress of the loans and wants to set up instant transfers or some other system where he wouldn\u2019t remind me every month. I said we could explore that, and then a few weeks after that I found out I had cancer again. He called me to ask about my health and to ask about setting up the automatic transfers, I told him I was disappointed that he didn't have more empathy for me, and told him he'd get his precious money when I died. That's when he called me an asshole for \"making him enforce the divorce agreement.\" I send him the payments every time he reminds me, and he earns more than me now so it\u2019s not like it\u2019s an urgent matter.\u00a0AITA for not setting up auto-pay?", "created_utc": 1676293962, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1117x2j/aita_for_not_setting_up_autopay_for_my_sons/", "score": 491, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I personally choose to never make auto-pay transfers or payments, myself. Any illness is draining and a problem, so you have my sympathy.\n\nIt sounds like your son has been having to ask more than once though. If it's not a financial problem to pay, I suggest getting a second account - if it's free - even a savings account - and transferring money from your main checking to the second account. Then pull the auto pay from there. That way you're still actively monitoring how much is being pulled out and they don't have direct access to your checking. So, if the payment is $200, for example, put 400.01 in the account. Every month, make sure you put the $200 and there's a pad of a full payment in there to keep a minimum balance. I guess people hate this answer and think you are an a-hole. But, just do your best.

I haven\u2019t spoken to my father in close to 20 years.", "YTA = Well, he's your kid and you should want him to do better than you. Have a better life, marriage, job, whatever. Yes, set up auto-pay or tighten your belt and pay it off.", "YTA. Actually deadbeat dad attitude comes to mind. YOU owe this. PAY IT!", "YTA. I have cancer. I don\u2019t use it as an excuse to be a jerk", "YTA. You're the one who said that you would help pay for his college. It's not just because you have cancer that you are struggling financially; it's also because of bad dating choices that you make. Now you're threatening to withhold the money altogether; you sound jealous that he makes a lot of money now and you're angry that he's not supporting you financially. He doesn't have to. Loans cost a lot of money, mainly because of interest, so he shouldn't be forced to pay for those just because you're jealous and angry.", "YTA - I\u2019m sorry but you signed an agreement and didn\u2019t honor it.  \n\nMaking him Venmo request you each month seems spiteful to me.  You clearly don\u2019t want to honor the agreement so you have been making it as inconvenient as possible.  Just set up the autopay.", "YTA", "Wow.  Best wishes for your success in fighting cancer.\n\nStill, there\u2019s no doubt YTA.  The reasons have been well summarized by others, however, I urge you to adopt a respectful adult relationship with your child.  You\u2019re in your 50s and not in your first stages of cancer - I wish you long life but you have some urgent work to do on your relationship with your son.\n\nFirst, can you afford to pay the loans off?  It sounds like this may be the core issue which is now compounded by the costs/complications of cancer.  \n\nWhatever the answer above is, it should guide your next conversation.  If payment is a problem now, then it\u2019s a \u201creality of life\u201c conversation (it doesn\u2019t absolve the obligation). \n\nRegardless your son is just starting out and hasn\u2018t had a chance to build savings and is facing his own start of adult life expenses.  What is the impact to his monthly budget?  Have you considered the impact on him having to constantly ask?", "YTA", "You should've honored the court order and paid upfront, not kicked the can down the road.\n\nYou had no right making him take loans.\n\nYTA", "YTA You should have already paid the debt. He should not have to ask you every month.", "Well that divorce settlement sucked, child support, alimony, sure but having college tuition thrown in there.....damn you needed a better lawyer.\n\nIt is court ordered however so you do have to pay it, wouldn't hurt to set up autopay. Sounds as if you don't want to though. \n\nNTA for not setting up autopay, as long as you are paying it doesn't really matter that you \"need\" reminded.\n\nY TA though because you are being petty and \"need\" reminded.", "And he only started paying \u201cmost\u201d six months ago\u2026 so has he only paid four times or so?", "In fact automatic payments would probably make things easier for OP as it is one less thing to worry about", "This was not so much a promise but a part of a divorce decree. A legal document. Son has deferred payments for what 6/7 years?", "You mean money he pissed away on women. He told son to take out loans and he would repay after graduation son has deferred payments for 6/7 years. Setting up auto pay would make OP'S life easier.", "Right? And it's even worse because it was part of the divorce decree, so the son may not legally be *able* to let him off the hook and OP is *still* trying.", "Cancer doesn\u2019t redeem you of being a scummy dad.", "YTA you made some dumb choices. Unfortunately you made a choice before that to pay for your kids college. Too bad so sad I doubt you\u2019ll learn your lesson and make better choice but you and only you are on the hook for this. The longer you put it off the more expensive it will be for you", "YTA. You and your wife couldn\u2019t make\nYour marriage work. You agreed to rules. None of this is your kid\u2019s fault. Set up autopsy or use that google Calender and be an adult.", "YTA. Your son\u2018s job and income has nothing to do with your obligation and he certainly shouldn\u2019t be penalized for your \u201cpoor dating decisions\u201d. Pay the student loans. Quit making this a monthly point of stress with your son. Be happy that he presumably excelled in school and now has a promising career.   \nBest of luck to you in your health.", "I would die from cancer before I would break a promise. People should *never* have to ask me to do what I told them I would do.\n\nPeople forget what we say and what we do, but they never forget how we make them feel. I want to be remembered as a man of integrity who followed through on his promises to other people.\n\nYTA - This could be your opportunity to establish an enduring legacy as a man who people will remember fondly.", "YTA. \n\nCome on brah. Auto pay takes like 5 minutes to set up. You have this responsibility because it was part of your divorce decree. \n\nYou sound like a deadbeat who prioritized your girlfriends post divorce over your legal financial obligations. I\u2019m sorry about the cancer, nobody deserves it, but for the love of god take five minutes and set up auto pay like an adult.", "YTA 7+ yrs ago you made a deal where you'd cover college expenses. You couldn't fulfill your end of the deal because you were out banging gold diggers so your son graciously took out loans that you were meant to repay. Now 2-3yrs later (or more) you are repaying the loans as slowly as possible and forcing your son to reach out to you every month to remind you to pay instead of just taking over the loans or setting up autopay. Your kid could have just forced you to pay 7yrs ago and his empathy put him in a situation where he's still dealing with a big debt that you may or may not pay, he's out of empathy so just pay your debt.", "YTA why are you guilting your son for asking to set up autopay when he has to remind you every month. Just admit the real issue is you feel you should be off the hook for the debt and likely delayed repayment so you could weasel out of covering it.", "Take out a loan and pay him the lump sum like you promised\u2026 then you can deal with the monthly payments. YTa", "YTA.\n\nI'm sorry you're ill, and divorce does certainly throw a wrench into plans, but the fact is, you made an agreement and your son is absolutely right in calling you out for him having to remind you/force you to pay the debt you agreed to.\n\nParenting doesn't stop at a certain age and what your son makes is completely irrelevant.", "Will there be anything to inherit when you die? It doesn't sound like you have made the kind of financial decisions that will leave an inheritance. \n\n\nIf you signed a document saying you'd pay for college but are now making your son ask you for the money each and every month, then yes. YTA. If you want out of the responsibility to pay, then talk to him about it. Trying to dodge responsibilities without the hit to your pride of acknowledging what you're doing is always an AH move.", "YTA in this one. You made a deal and it's your responsibility, the fact that your son has a higher paying job has absolutely nothing to do with it. If you're no longer able to make payments due to health cost, maybe you could talk to your son about a temporary solution, but that doesn't seem the case here (otherwise OP would say so). Your son is understandably upset to have to remind you to pay for a debt you asked him to take for you. Honor your word if you can, that's way more important than money.", "Also by not paying them off or potentially on time if he waits until his son Venmo\u2019s a request, the debt is considered the son\u2019s so it gets considered when he applies for new credit and could potentially impact his ability to buy a house or something.  I think OP should set up auto payments with the servicer directly.  I agree, the cancer is sad and unfortunate but it does not eliminate the obligation", "I agree, YTA big timeOP, sorry for your cancer diagnosis. I hope you get into remission again. However, a legal binding agreement is the legal binding agreement and you have to pay.", "Son still has debt from school. His dad didn\u2019t pay for 7 years.", "Yes.  Keep your word.  kt", "YTA. What pathetic excuse for a father depletes his son\u2019s college fund for sex? And not just one dating mistake, MULTIPLE?!", "YTA. Are you not setting up autopay so he will contact you each month. Like he won't if he didn't have to remind you? Set it up and stop the games. Doesn't matter how much he makes, you owe for the loan so pay up. Grow up. You had cancer, lots of us have, I still had to pay my bills.", "YTA This was part of you're divorce. It isn't caused by your son, he didn't divorce you. You owed money in the divorce and you've been trying to avoid it ever since.", "op has time to write this post but not time to set up the automatic payments\n\nYTA", "NTA, since when are parents obligated to pay for their child\u2019s college tuition! \nYou are sick and don\u2019t need stress in your life right now!", "I would agree, except my attorney told me very directly that no court can enforce a divorce decree between parents of a minor child regarding paying for the child's their college education...because at that point they attend college, the child is no longer a minor. It was very frustrating when I learned this since my ex has my son's college fund held hostage.", "OP is obligated because he signed a legal agreement, and now refuses to abide by its letter or spirit."]}
