{"id": 9858, "submission_id": "1117x2j", "title": "AITA for not setting up autopay for my son's student debt because of divorce+cancer?", "selftext": "I (50sM) got divorced about seven years ago. The whole divorce process did some real damage, financially and emotionally. My son (20sM) had just started college, and as part of the settlement I signed on to take all financial responsibility for college. At first I was going to pay outright, but since money got shifted around in the divorce, I told him to take out loans and I would pay for them as a lump-sum after he graduated (he didn\u2019t qualify for aid because of my salary). After the divorce, I admittedly made some poor dating decisions and had to deal with the fallout of that. That bad relationship and other things have come up over the years, and I began to pay most of the payments starting 6 months ago. Usually my son venmo requests me each month and I send it that way.\n\nHere\u2019s the thing: he has graduated and gotten a great job, and, as of a year ago, earns more than me now. I got cancer a couple of years ago and had to deal with all the bills (the insurance covered it but I had to cover the co-pay). I recovered, thankfully, and have continued to send the monthly payments. My son recently told me that he feels that sending the venmo requests adds to the stress of the loans and wants to set up instant transfers or some other system where he wouldn\u2019t remind me every month. I said we could explore that, and then a few weeks after that I found out I had cancer again. He called me to ask about my health and to ask about setting up the automatic transfers, I told him I was disappointed that he didn't have more empathy for me, and told him he'd get his precious money when I died. That's when he called me an asshole for \"making him enforce the divorce agreement.\" I send him the payments every time he reminds me, and he earns more than me now so it\u2019s not like it\u2019s an urgent matter.\u00a0AITA for not setting up auto-pay?", "created_utc": 1676293962, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1117x2j/aita_for_not_setting_up_autopay_for_my_sons/", "score": 245, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

However, this is a responsibility you agreed to, and your son took loans strictly within the context of that agreement. \n\nCancer is horrible to say the least. And I am genuinely sorry for what you are going through. But you also admit your financial woes are in large part due to poor dating choices.

Asking you to handle your affairs or suggesting ways to handle the complexity of life isnt AH behavior... It's just a reasonable request when times are difficult.

Expecting that he contacts you, for instance in the days following a chemo treatment... And asks you to remember anything would be freaking wack. \n\nThe divorce decree is what it is. And it sucks. You're not saying it's a lack of money or resources that is the issue... You're saying your divorce decree no longer counts because your kid is successful and you have cancer...

A loving son would understand and maybe be like , Hey dad I can take care of it now - knowing he makes more. Sht happens and I bet if this went to court it would be hard to hold you due to financial difficulties. What if cancer made you to disabled to work then what would your son do? Sue you?", "I can't really pick sides, bc idk a lot about divorce and money.. I would just leave everything as it is, bc it seems to work out just fine and if your son allegedly has a little bit more money than u, then it shouldn't be a problem.\nYou both just gotta figure things out tbh.", "NTA - If he's getting the money the divorce settlement is being fulfilled. I personally choose to never make auto-pay transfers or payments, myself. Any illness is draining and a problem, so you have my sympathy.\n\nIt sounds like your son has been having to ask more than once though. If it's not a financial problem to pay, I suggest getting a second account - if it's free - even a savings account - and transferring money from your main checking to the second account. Then pull the auto pay out of there. That way you're still actively monitoring how much is being pulled out and they don't have direct access to your checking. So, if the payment is $200, for example, put 400.01 in the account. Every month, make sure you put the $200 and there's a pad of a full payment in there to keep a minimum balance. I guess people hate this answer and think you are an a-hole. But, just do your best.
