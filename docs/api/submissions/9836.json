You don't share private medical info about someone else. You just don't. You absolutely violated her trust. You don't have to lie to your folks, just say you can't make it because of a private issue you're helping someone you're close to with. Full stop. If they press you, tell them everything is fine but you can't violate that trust they put in you and you hope they can respect that.  Speak no further about it", "Yes. You are a huge asshole in this case.\n\nYou\u2019re worried about lying to your mum, father and brother while your girlfriend is looking for support in one of the biggest decisions she\u2019s ever had to make?! \nAnd you don\u2019t even know if they\u2019ve told anyone else?! \n\nIt looks like you\u2019re trying to cover your own butt in all of this and placing too much of the \u201cblame\u201d on your girlfriend.

You should be ashamed of your lack of understanding and back bone. This will end the relationship, I am certain.", "YTA what part of I don\u2019t want anyone to know did you not understand? You don\u2019t have the ability to say to your parents that, a matter is private and it\u2019s just not something you wish to discuss with them? Instead you just HAD to tell them something you were explicitly asked not too. That was not something you had the right to share. She now has to deal with getting rid of a baby, which regardless if wanted or not is a hard thing ti do and everyone knowing her private business. Big YTA", "Are you 12? Seriously, act like an adult and man up...You sound more concerned about a vacation than your girlfriends wellbeing...And yes, YTA, she asked you to keep quiet and you violated her wishes.", "YTA. Man, and a HUGE one. Just make up something. Or even better- get completely rid of the package. Shred it. Throw it in a public trash can. Rip it to pieces and throw it down the toilet. You live with your family, man. Did the possibility of your folks finding the box even passed through your head?", "YTA! Jesus dude, learn to tell a white lie. You should have been extra vigilant about disposing the test, but accidents happen. You telling your entire family that she's having an abortion is extremely fucked up. Apologize profusely if you want to keep your gf, and learn to keep better boundaries with your family while you live with them.", "YTA if you keep running to mommy's all the time you are not ready to be a parent. Yoy don't even sound like an adult.\n\nYou did violate her privacy. You shared her medical procedure with other people. Who the fuck are you to talk about what she is going through. I hope she dumps your ass and finds someone who respects her and that she can trust.", "My dude, I think you need some training on how to use a filter. Not everybody needs to know everything. It\u2019s not your mom\u2019s business. Some things should stay private. You also don\u2019t need to pass along the shitty things your mom says about your girlfriend based on questionable information she shouldn\u2019t even have", "YTA, you should have found a way to deflect.\n\nThat being said, I hope everyone who knows is being supportive and telling GF that she has nothing to be ashamed about, her body, her choice!!! In a perfect world it wouldn't have been a big deal that others knew, but unfortunately we're not there.", "YTA. Could have said it was a medical emergency that do not concern them. They are not owed a precise explanation on what the emergency was. And seeing how women are shamed for aborting and the number of pro-lifer, it was super understandable that she didn't want to speak about it with your family. Especially since the relationship is new. Beside your title says \"aita for telling them she won't keep it\", as if your family has an issue with the abortion. I really hope it is not the case, otherwise you are a double AH. Abortion is hard, it's a difficult subject and experience to go through, very traumatizing, your gf asked you one thing and you did not respect it. Hope she doesn't feel too lonely in this, because it seems like she is.\n\nEdit: you clearly have no idea how unwanted pregnancies impact women and you should look it up, because you clearly lack empathy and i hope it's only because you are uneducated. Do you even know how traumatizing and physically painful it is for women ? And not just mentally but the risks of aborting, the cramps, the loss of blood, etc. You sounds insufferable and so does your mom. She couldn't be less supportive and more of an asshole than she was after saying your gf might try to baby trap you. How insulting and mysoginistic", "YTA. Assuming she knew your parents found out, they would\u2019ve asked sooner or later, and it would\u2019ve come out. But telling them when she specifically asked you not to was stupid. Especially before the operation. She\u2019s probably already dealing with some degree of guilt, and now knows your family knows and is stressing about that too. Bonehead move OP", "YTA\n\nIt's her private medical information and not for you to spread around.  You need to take this as a major lesson.  As for your girlfriend, good luck with keeping her once the abortion has been done because I think this is an unrepairable breach of trust.", "YTA. I get that you\u2019re obviously involved with causing the pregnancy, but it\u2019s her body. Y\u2019all aren\u2019t keeping the baby, so it\u2019s not about the potential child and your role as the father. With the decision you two have made, at the root it\u2019s about her medical care. \n\nSo you essentially gave your family intimate details about your girlfriends medical care. Twice. After she said she didn\u2019t want them to know, so yeah YTA. \n\nWith your mom, you didn\u2019t \u201chave\u201d to tell her the truth, but realistically she\u2019s not likely to be dumb enough to buy a lie at that point. You still should\u2019ve apologized without the \u201cbut I had to cause she\u2019s my mommy\u201d at the end. \n\nWith your dad, you not only betrayed her trust again, you did it in front of an audience.

It\u2019s not my place to share.\u201d And stuck up for your gf. \n\nBut you also know you fucked up here, or you wouldn\u2019t be offering the excuse of \u201coh well they just forced it out of me and I can\u2019t possibly lie to family\u201d when it wasn\u2019t your truth to tell.", "Yta. \u201cMom just a pregnancy scare, alls good\u201d.

So you have every right to talk to someone about this. Partners can\u2019t force each other to keep secrets, up to a certain extend. If it\u2019s a life event (and finding out your girlfriend is pregnant and deciding to abort is not only a life event to her) that involves yourself you have every right to share this with people close to you. I get that she is upset about that. But it\u2019s not fair to expect you to deal with something like this \u00e1nd lie to your parents. \n\nIf she can\u2019t deal with you being close to your parents you might not be compatible.

This didnt help but I cant help but feel that her trying to place limits on your communication with important people in your life is a step too far. Youre aborting your child too. You should be able to talk to people if you need to. Your gf may feel that talking with her and experiencing this with her is sufficient but she doesnt get to make that decision for you. Thats a bit of a revealing thing for her if you decide that you need to share with others. That she feels shame is unfortunate. Youre adults making choices and you\u2019ve decided that this isnt the right time for a child. The decision is made.

You act like she would be just a machine to give OP a child.", "i really like this response, but i feel like a conversation should be had with his gf, before any other steps\n\nit is as much her business, as it is for him as well. she\u2019s not placing limits on his communication because she\u2019s trying to control him; she doesn\u2019t want him talking about what\u2019s also her personal life to other people \u2014 and that\u2019s reallyyy understandable \n\nlike she\u2019s the one pregnant, she\u2019s the one aborting the baby and going through with the medical procedure \u2014 the least he could do is be respectful of her privacy", ">because your mom saw the test.\n\nHe said she saw the package. He could have simply said they had a suspicion but the test was negative. Easy as that. There was no need for him to air out her personal medical information. He had no right to do that.\n\nIf you think a little white lie is worse than completely betraying your partners trust than I don't know what to say to that.", ">you did the right thing by telling your family the truth\n\nNo, no OP didn\u2019t. OP's gf is entitled to privacy regarding this. The only people who should know about this and decide who knows and who doesn\u2019t should be agreed upon by the couple. OP's gf asked OP to not tell anyone and OP does the exact opposite", "In some places ir against the law to share someone else's medical information. And even if it's not, no one should share info that is not their own.", "If he\u2019d said \u201eI\u2019m really struggling with this and needed someone to talk to, so I spoke to my dad about it bud asked him to keep it between us for the time being\u201c I would\u2019ve understood, but from what he said in his post that isn\u2019t the reason he told his family.", "Just read it,  sheesh", "How did he not? He told his mother everything about it when first pressed. That wasn't his information to disclose, he wasn't the only one involved.", "\ud83d\udcaf absolutely! Imagine not being able to trust your partner with something this simple. Then him not even understanding if he\u2019s the AH and why you would be this upset. It\u2019s so baffling to me.", "We live in a scandinavian country so it\u2019s fine. But my GF grew up in a religious family and so she still feels \u201cshame\u201d and her mother would be mad if she knew.", "You need to learn that something's better left alone. \nYour family doesn't need to know everything. \nYTA \nGrow up.", "Doesn't matter, dude. You do NOT share information about someone else's medical history without their permission. You especially don't do it if they've clearly expressed to you that they don't want anyone to know. \n\nYou're welcome to \"share everything\" with your family when it doesn't effect others. Your choice effects your gf and you failed to consider that. As I said before, you did not HAVE TO tell anyone anything. You CHOSE to tell them.", "that shouldn\u2019t include private business between you and your gf - she obviously wasn\u2019t comfortable with it and never okay\u2019d it either", "What a telling response. Someone else\u2019s information is NOT YOURS TO SHARE. YTA YTA YTA", "You can tell your family anything you want about *you*. That doesn't extend to blabbing about other people's private medical information without their consent.", "Then marry your mother. No girlfriend or wife will take second chair to your relationship with your mother.

Being close doesn't give you a pass to disrespect her and betray her", "It doesn\u2019t matter how \u2018close\u2019 you are, this wasn\u2019t your information to tell. Your *girlfriend* doesn\u2019t tell your family everything, and you violated her privacy.", "Boundaries. Learn them quick unless you want to be single for the rest of your life.", "So its better to tell them and for them to just say \"shes trying to baby trap you???\" YTA just because YOU are close to them doesnt meen YOUR GF is. Do you really think they will not tell anyone. There will be people who will shame your gf because they ar also AH. She wanted suport and you insted told your family who HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THIS. I hope you make sure they wont tell anyone when they shoudnt even know! You betraed your gf", "It might not be easy to accept but if you're not willing to set boundaries with your family you're honestly not ready for an adult relationship.", "Then you should warn people you get into a relationship with.", "Well you\u2019re definitely not mature enough to be a father so at least you have that.

I'm very close to my family but I'm a responsible adult who is loyal and discreet when asked to be. \nGrow some guts and use better contraception in future.", "I think it depends tbh. Imo we need more info if we wanna judge whether telling the mom makes him an AH or not. It can be difficult to be put on the spot in a situation like that, so I could understand if he wasn't able to just come up with a plausible impromptu lie. A positive pregnancy test in your apartment is kind of pretty clear giveaway about what's going on. And then the mom might've come to her own conclusion and make things worse anyway. I think it also plays a role how he'd expect his mom to react. If she's liberal and someone who minds her own business, telling her would make him less of an AH, as if he tells her knowing she's an avid pro-lifer.\n\nEither way, telling his dad was unneccessary and absolutely makes him the AH.", "In that case, I have to say, I can see why your gf thinks you are the asshole. What possessed you to tell your gf what your mum said? Also, why would your mum say that if it\u2019s not her intention to keep it? Your girlfriend now knows your mum doesn\u2019t like her and will feel unwelcome in your home. I will edit my response", ">But my mom said to me she might be baby trapping me and that i should be careful.\n\nShe sounds like a peach.\n\nHopefully your girlfriend wises up to the fact that you are disrespecting her to appease a person who would jump straight to accusing her of baby-trapping you and decides she can do better.\n\nYou have a *lot* of growing up to do, my dude.", "Well clearly she isn't baby trapping you. Why are you always running to mommy's? I thought you were an adult. Learn to make adult decisions and cut your umbilical cord with your mother.", "Your mother is a bigger asshole,  she is having abortion and you had no right to tell anyone.  Why would you tell your girlfriend your mother said that and why the hell would your mother say that when she is not keeping the baby.  Girlfriend should run a mile from you and your mother or her next post will be, help my boyfriend is a big momma\u2019s boy and it\u2019s ruining our relationship", "So your mom is the type to leap to IMMEDIATELY villainizing your girlfriend... and you decided to give her a ton of ammunition by revealing something very sensitive about your GF's reproductive decisions? You understand that you have probably severely fucked up the relationship between your GF and your family here, right?", "May it be because your gf who told you she doesn't want the kid is being accused by a third party, which she wanted to avoid by keeping it private ? Or is it because accusing her is insulting, mysoginistic and shows that your mother doesn't like her ? And WHY do you have to tell EVERYTHING to everyone and create more drama? Why even tell your gf what your mom said? Your mom is so insulting and diminishing, that is unbelievable. Seems like being an AH runs in the family. Congratulation on betraying your gf's trust, making her aware your mom doesn't like her, and confirming her fears. Why do you even think she wanted to avoid others knowing ? Exactly because women are shit on for unplanned pregnancy and because now she would have to keep being in a relationship while knowing her in laws are asshole. Hope she breaks up. You not even seeing this by yourself is so sad for your gf, she deserves better, someone who will respect her. You obviously don't see how unwanted pregnancies are a serious matter.

Theres all sorts of relationships and they may not each be on the same page. This will definitely clear things up. \n\nAs far as whose personal life this is, its her medical situation but its also his child being aborted.

He could have just said it was his gf freind and his freind asked him to hide it because of his or his gf parents. Come on we all lied at some point in our lifes it is not that hard.

I agree with you then. He's def the AH for giving it away and telling his mom too."]}
