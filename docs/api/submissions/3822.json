NTA.  \n\nKids need what they need when they need it.  A need that gets met gets outgrown in its own time. A need left unmet festers.  My adult kids are usually delightful, one is arranging donuts for me tomorrow morning.", "I might be in the minority here but I think NTA. I think it\u2019s cool that you find ways to spend time together, only a few more years and they are gone, enjoy the time you have. I\u2019m under the assumption that one of your scrubby head conversations is about proper hygiene. My kid is 9 and wants special time not dissimilar to these. Treasure it. It will be life-bonding. You can\u2019t get this time back. I floss for her a few times a week and we brush together a few times a day (9 is young but she has braces). We read together and she insists on walking the mile to the bus stop so we play and chat. I think your wife might be jealous. Maybe they can find something they both enjoy doing together. We also cook together and clean together, I teach her how to along the way. Quality time is doing life together.", "NTA. You sound like a good dad just trying to do the right thing.\n\nHow long has it been since he transitioned from baths to showers? Maybe he is working through the change and hasn't fully adjusted yet. When I first switched I used to like to sit and throw a sponge against the wall, draw in the steam on the glass doors... it took me a while to get used to the straight-to-business nature of showers. I think he'll get comfortable and figure things out in time.", "That's the sweetest thing I've read here today, I don't agree with your wife, this is not a hill to die on.  \n\nSoon enough, your son will grow out of this.  Treasure this time with him, I can't imagine how difficult it must be to be a child during these times when children grow up so fast.  \n\nNTA  You are winning at being dad.", "Your near-tween boy is asking you to spend time hanging out with him. That's..... really nice actually.\n\nStill, there's some complexity about the two things that he 'should' be able to do himself - washing hair and sleeping and solo.\n\nI think it's worth getting to the bottom of why he cries about washing his hair himself. That doesn't seem standard 9 yo to me. It's not that it's *terrible* that you wash his hair, it's that it's important to know if there's an underlying issue that's leading to tantrums.\n\nLikewise it's worth knowing why he doesn't/won't sleep on his own. It may be nothing, it may be something worth dealing with. He's a bit lonely/sad/anxious and struggles to get to sleep? Well then it's worth knowing. He has bigger worries that he is uncomfortable being alone with? Well definitely need to know.\n\nIt doesn't need to stop necessarily, and your bonding with him til now will actually make it easier to find out, but it is worth talking about what's going on.\n\nNAH.", "NTA - you sound like a kind and supportive parent who cares about your son's wellbeing and enjoy spending time with him\n\nJust be ... Not concerned but perhaps cautious. Admittedly I do not have a lot of experience with young children but this sounds like behavior from a younger child than 9, nothing wrong with that just don't let him slip backwards if that makes sense.\n\n My cousin had similar difficulties when he was younger and he slid back - like way back - and he still has issues with basic hygiene and keeping a schedule on his own as a teenager. Maybe this is what your wife is concerned about? Alternatively she might just be missing time with you in this case and not expressing that well.", "NAH. I understand both sides. I personally think it\u2019s a smidge weird with a 9 year old, but I\u2019m sure in one or two years, he will think he\u2019s too cool to have a parent help wash his hair and fall asleep next to him and you\u2019ll miss that special bonding time. Nothing about what you\u2019re doing is inappropriate or damaging to his development.", "NTA. I think it's nice, however, it's probably a good idea if eventually he learns to wash his hair.", "NAH. I get it, it\u2019s a nice bonding moment with your kid, it makes things easier. So I don\u2019t think you\u2019re in the wrong. However I don\u2019t think you\u2019re wife is wrong either. This kid seems to be regressing for some reason. Needing a parent next to you to fall asleep at the age of 9 doesn\u2019t seem normal. \n\nEnjoy the bonding moment, but don\u2019t let your kid regress, they need to become independent with this kind of stuff. It\u2019s so much easier to give in. But that\u2019s teaching them anything in the long run.", "NTA-  I think we make kids grow up too fast.  He's nine, not nineteen.", "NTA. You're not \"spoiling him\" by helping, and it sounds like a nice bonding experience that he enjoys (you too). \n\nNot sure about the horror movie comparison, but whatever.", "We\u2019ve gotten a little sterile in our culture and I think we forget that children need to be touched. If your kid understands affection through close proximity and hair washing so be it. I agree with your wife, it\u2019s a problem if he really can\u2019t/is refusing to do it alone, but this sounds more to me like a kid that just needs hugs and roughhousing. It\u2019s likely middle school will convince him it \u201cisn\u2019t manly\u201d to hug your dad, so I\u2019d enjoy it while you can. NAH", "NAH, your wife is right, 9 is definitely old enough to wash yourself and put yourself to bed and sleep by yourself. And also you're definitely not a bad parent for trying to bond with and help your son. \n\nThat said, some of the things you've said give me the impression there's something more going on with your son than not wanting to wash his hair, etc. I think this is something you and your wife should bring up with a therapist.", "NAH", "NTA - as long as your still trying to move to the goal of him washing himself.", "NAH But he does need to learn to do his hair better. We went through the same thing. The sleeping thing is NBD. Every night , no. Couple nights a week? Enjoy it while it lasts. \ud83e\udd23", "You're giving your son what he needs.

I had very long curly high maintenance hair, and no clue how to even figure out what it needed. Curls are very particular. It was in bad shape for years.", "NTA- I'm still washing my 12 yr ild girls hair. NOT in the shower as she does need privacy but I do her hair once a week in the sink so I know she has a good wash.

A 9-year-old should not be putting themself to bed. They should have books and cuddles and talks and whatever. Often the evening is the time that we all have to just be done with the rest of the world and spend time together. Kids need affection and attention. I have a 9-year-old. Mine has super long hair and not super great motor skills, so I wash her hair for her/with her, but our night time routine involves reading together and cuddling and sometimes we fall asleep together, too. I really cherish these years.", "NTA \n\nOk so I used to be the same when I was younger around 10 I hated washing my hair. I would sit in the tub just waiting for enough time to pass for it to be believable that I washed my hair. Like I have now idea why but that\u2019s what I did. My mom like you got tired of telling me over and over. She decided not to let me be that smelly kid because let\u2019s be honest kids play and sweat and need hair to be clean and washed. She would come in and wash my hair for me we would talk she would be annoyed lol but there I was clean and just fine. \n\nI will tell you that I got over it fairly quickly and just started washing my own hair. But definitely there\u2019s nothing wrong with your parenting. It\u2019s a phase it passes and there are worse problems than spending extra time just hanging out with your kid and washing their hair.", "This\u2026 isn\u2019t weird at all? It\u2019s literally childcare? He\u2019s a 9 year old kid who needs help washing his hair and probably enjoys the extra bonding time he has with you, there isn\u2019t anything weird about it. Some kids need extra attention, that\u2019s fine. It\u2019s really awesome you\u2019re listening to him and making sure his needs are met. \n\nMy mom blow dried and styled my hair for me most mornings before school until I was in high school. I was perfectly capable of doing it myself, but appreciated the help and she enjoyed getting to pamper me.", "NTA, but I'm a little concerned at your comparison. As a mom, she's probably thinking that there's a boundary that you're Crossing by saying that it's like showing a child an rrated movie. Your child is probably wanting more connection, and I think the time together is important, but so is showing him what he needs to do in order to properly care for his body. I say that as a stepmom of a 10 year old boy. When I met him at 7 years old his mom was still wiping his bottom. I understand that kids want help, and connection, but our job as parents is to teach them how to take care of themselves. Maybe taking a different part of the night to focus on connection would help is this. If you don't encourage him to take care of this himself he will continue to rely on you, possibly to unhealthy levels.", "[deleted]", "NTA, but maybe you should let him go for a bit. Once he starts hearing his peers discussing his lack of hygiene can be a valuable spur for his self-progress.", "Kids need what they need when they need it.\n\nI love this.

Hes also neurodivergent (like his parents) so some multistep tasks take longer for him to get right the entire way through. While he quickly passed the adults washing his hair, he did like having company in the bathroom but also struggled to continue hair hygiene on his own. So we'd sit in the bathroom on the toilet with the shower curtain shut, he'd pop his head out to check if his hair was wet enough, we'd dispense the shampoo for him to scrub, same thing with conditioner. And we'd just chit chat while he did his hair routine. We'd step out when he said he was done so he could dry off and get into PJs in privacy and then we'd task through teeth brushing and bathroom cleaning cuz he'd dry off like a shaggy dog.", "You can explain what you\u2019re doing while you wash his hair so he will get better.

Our daughter is 12 this month and while I haven't help-helped her in the shower since she hit puberty about 18 months ago, she still sometimes needs a hand with her hair so we do some shower curtain contortionist crap and I help her out.

This is honestly really wholesome and I\u2019m really happy you\u2019re spending time with your son. You\u2019re a good dad", "NTA  This will be a fleeting phase in your son's life, one where you get to share some extra comfort and bonding with him.  Kids go three steps forward and one step back on maturing.  Your son is in a phase where he's growing up but seeking some of the comforts of  being younger.  And you are there to provide them which is special and good for him.  It makes him feel safe and stable and prepared for the life coming up. You're not going to be washing his hair and reading him a bedtime story when he's 16. If your wife thinks something is wrong, maybe try to talk to someone, do some research. I don't see anything wrong and you're a great dad.", "Doughnut arranging? On sticks? Mixed in with a few roses? Or a few croissants?", "I didn\u2019t read it as he cries about washing his own hair, just that he chucks it about having to get back in the shower to do it \u2026 which I know my little dude totally would do, if I approached him, dry and dressed and said he us to get back in and wash his hair properly, sounds like he subscribes to the wet = clean concept. \n\nMy little guy also likes me to sit with him as he falls asleep, not because of any issues, but because he often thinks of a million things just before sleep\u2026 and he likes that I\u2019m there to tell me immediately or to ask. I know I often think of things as I\u2019m falling asleep too", "The thing is, if he has some unusual issues, ignoring them and trying to force him to do the things he doesn't want to do isn't going to address those issues at all.   It's better that he's accepting the help and that can lead to discussing things.   So either way (nothing wrong with it or something wrong with it), the fathers way of being there for him and helping with these bedtime tasks is the better choice.", "What do you mean?

By the time I was 5, I was made to shower with my 3 year old sister so they didn't have to do it. I was 5. I hardly got myself clean much less her.  All without adult supervision. Then when I went to my grandma's house,  she'd yell at me for not getting all the soap out of my hair. I don't even remember when someone ever showed me how to wash my very long curly hair,  I was too young to remember,  if they ever did. You are caring for your son.  He's 9. He can do it by himself sure, but if he needs help,  and he clearly does,  someone needs to help out. It sounds like you two got closer as he sees the love and care you put in,  it's wonderful he's wanting to cuddle and he's finding comfort in his dad.  That's what parents are for.  I was pushed to grow up fast and my parents wonder why I grew up so fast and have been ready to move out since my 13th birthday. My parents always talked about how much of a drain us kids were, how they basically ruined their lives by having us so young so this must be why.  I had my daughter at 32. She's 2. I wanted her very much. I don't want to push her to grow up and fend for herself until she's ready. If she needs help,  I'll help her. She's my child.

Discussion is the way here.If he needs help give him help, but figure out why and see if he can work towards doing it himself. if he can't okay now you know and you can deal with that.\n\nMy point is it's really easy to see people/kids struggling to do something you find easy and just say - here let me do it for you. This isn't a problem when it's once in a while but if it's every time it's frustrating and damaging to the person in question.", "Essentially don't let the kid become dependent and stop working towards getting those skills/independence that come with getting older/doing things on their own.
