My mom married their dad two years ago, and it\u2019s been a bit of an adjustment. I don\u2019t visit often because I live hours away, but come down for holidays.\nA & S were always chilly to me but I figured it was the age difference and different interests. I\u2019d invite them out but they rarely accepted. The thought crossed my mind that they were excluding me, because they\u2019d do things with my brother (22), but I brushed it off as overthinking.\nA couple months ago we went on a family trip. When we got there, A & S went off to the shops, and I went to the beach. At dinner my mom and stepdad got onto us for not spending time together, and A & S said they didn\u2019t want to spend time with me because I wasn\u2019t approachable.\nI\u2019ll admit I have RBF, and often get lost in thought. I apologized and said I\u2019d make an effort to be conscious of my face. But it bothered me. So I started asking people about it.\nI\u2019m close with my SIL so I told her about it and she was taken aback, and said I looked like I was deep in thought, but disagreed I looked unpleasant. I brushed it off for the rest of the trip, but it\u2019s hard to consciously be smiling all the time.\nWhen I returned home it kept nagging at me, so I started asking everyone about it, because it really upset me. Everyone I spoke to disagreed with what S & A said, my work bestie telling me I was the most approachable person she knew. \nAfter thinking on it I decided I\u2019d be cordial to S & A but didn\u2019t want to have a relationship with them. My mom wasn\u2019t happy and said I should tell them I was hurt, but honestly, I don\u2019t want to have a relationship with them given they purposefully excluded me. But I love my mom so agreed to have a zoom meeting to try to work it out.\nIt didn\u2019t go well. They said they shouldn\u2019t have to invite me when I have an ugly face all the time, and maybe if I smiled more I would have friends and wouldn\u2019t expect to be brought along everywhere. I\u2019ll admit, I lost my temper. For two and a half years I tried, I would ask about their interests and try to engage with them and they would give one word answers. I was tired of trying and always being the bigger person. So I said \u2018if you find my face so repulsive then f*cking look away.\u2019 And hung up the call. \nMy mom says I\u2019m the adult here and should\u2019ve handled it better because they\u2019re just kids.

I find it BONKERS that this mom is organising a zoom meeting to make her daughter and her stepdaughters talk about why one of them went to the beach and the other 2 went shopping...?! \n\nI'm not precisely as close with every single cousin either, but as long as we come together to organise Christmas and to pool funds for a special present for our gran, does that really matter?\n\nETA upon rereading the post I see OP does feel excluded.
