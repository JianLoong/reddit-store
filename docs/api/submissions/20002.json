My mom married their dad two years ago, and it\u2019s been a bit of an adjustment.

I\u2019d invite them out but they rarely accepted. The thought crossed my mind that they were excluding me, because they\u2019d do things with my brother (22), but I brushed it off as overthinking.\nA couple months ago we went on a family trip. When we got there, A & S went off to the shops, and I went to the beach. At dinner my mom and stepdad got onto us for not spending time together, and A & S said they didn\u2019t want to spend time with me because I wasn\u2019t approachable.\nI\u2019ll admit I have RBF, and often get lost in thought. I apologized and said I\u2019d make an effort to be conscious of my face. But it bothered me. So I started asking people about it.\nI\u2019m close with my SIL so I told her about it and she was taken aback, and said I looked like I was deep in thought, but disagreed I looked unpleasant. I brushed it off for the rest of the trip, but it\u2019s hard to consciously be smiling all the time.\nWhen I returned home it kept nagging at me, so I started asking everyone about it, because it really upset me. Everyone I spoke to disagreed with what S & A said, my work bestie telling me I was the most approachable person she knew. \nAfter thinking on it I decided I\u2019d be cordial to S & A but didn\u2019t want to have a relationship with them. My mom wasn\u2019t happy and said I should tell them I was hurt, but honestly, I don\u2019t want to have a relationship with them given they purposefully excluded me. But I love my mom so agreed to have a zoom meeting to try to work it out.\nIt didn\u2019t go well. They said they shouldn\u2019t have to invite me when I have an ugly face all the time, and maybe if I smiled more I would have friends and wouldn\u2019t expect to be brought along everywhere. I\u2019ll admit, I lost my temper. For two and a half years I tried, I would ask about their interests and try to engage with them and they would give one word answers. I was tired of trying and always being the bigger person. So I said \u2018if you find my face so repulsive then f*cking look away.\u2019 And hung up the call. \nMy mom says I\u2019m the adult here and should\u2019ve handled it better because they\u2019re just kids.

NTA", "NTA. \n\nI have resting \u201csad \u201dface and ADHD-PI (primarily inattentive). I just kinda space out, get lost in my thoughts, get distracted by something nearby, etc. \n\nGrowing up I got a lot of comments about my face and I developed a \u201cpleasant\u201d mask like you described. It\u2019s extremely exhausting and made all of my social interactions so much more difficult.\n\nPlease don\u2019t listen to A&S. They don\u2019t like you and are choosing DARVO tactics (Deny, Attack, and Reverse Victim and Offender) to blame you for their actions. \n\nYour mom is probably taking her stance to keep the peace rather than confronting A&S. Which totally sucks. They deserve to be called out. There\u2019s no reason to try to have a relationship with two mean girls who clearly don\u2019t want one.", "NTA. For two years you've tried to build a relationship with them only the get one word or just short answers from them and you're the unaproacheable one? Your mother may be right in a way she didn't mean, they're just kids as in immature. I've seen kids more mature than them but you get what I'm trying to say. \n\nMy guess is they don't want a relationship with you for some reason and they were looking for anything just to not look bad in front of others, including blaming you.", "NTA wtf, they're not kids they're adults. Even kids know that they shouldn't say hurtful things. Fuck those girls fr, I wouldn't want to be their friend either", "NTA and they aren\u2019t kids.", "NTA. They\u2019re the problem not you. And they\u2019re not \u201ckids.\u201d They know better.", "NTA", "Agreed. RBF is an excuse for them to be AHs. \n\nAlso, to those that think women should smile or look more approachable or that they\u2019d be prettier if they smiled\u2026.eff off with that nonsense. I do t owe anyone a smile. If we\u2019re talking and I\u2019m happy I\u2019ll show it. I\u2019m not gonna smile like effing joker all the time. Do we ask this if men!! Not at all.", "This what I was thinking. The step sisters sound like Cinderella's evil duo, just striking out at OP for being better looking.", "Hey, brother and SIL aren't AHs.", "Appreciate the validation. \n\nIf there's no actionable agenda like \"the 4 kids (OP stepsisters and OP's brother) need to work out who will host Christmas and we're not leaving this zoom till you've sorted it and promise no one will complain later\"... a zoom meeting with reluctant participants is a total waste of time."]}
