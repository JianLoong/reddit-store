I really was conflicted about posting here, as I\u2019m scared of being bombarded with hate if I truly am in the wrong here - but at this point I just need to know.\n\nAITA for telling my soon to be sister in law, no, she cannot stage her proposal at my wedding reception? My wedding is in 2 months, so there is still time to change my answer and compromise if I am in the wrong.\n\nLast week my soon to be in-laws took me (22F)  out to dinner with my fiance Jim(31M). We were talking about wedding plans when suddenly SIL and MIL both say they have something important to discuss with me, and sorta giggle to each other like it was going to be some exciting little gossip. I figured it had to do with the bachelorette party so I got all excited too. They told me that SIL got proposed to over the weekend. I of course got all excited for her, asked to see the ring and all - very beautiful.\n\nThey then get a little hushed and tell me her fiance's proposal plan was rather lack-luster, and they\u2019re making him do a do-over with the family present. They then said that my wedding reception was the best place, since all our family and friends would be there.\n\nI asked them to tell me what exactly they had in mind, I mean I want to be the center of attention on my wedding day, it's what all girls dream of, but I was willing to at least hear the idea out. SIL would have to invite 3 of her friends, her future bridesmaids apparently, to be present - She would come out also wearing a wedding dress (???) - potentially my dress to cut costs - with my flower girl holding a sign that says \u201cbride to be\u201d and then of course, her being proposed to and carried off by her fiance out of the party.\n\nOf course I was floored, and said I wasn\u2019t too sure if that\u2019s really a good idea and I\u2019d talk it over with Jim. They told me they already talked it out with him and he said he thought I would definitely agree. I texted him to not cause any more issues at the table and he confirmed. I said I would think about it just to get out of the awkwardness/pressure for the rest of the evening - but once I sent a text once again clarifying no, I wouldn\u2019t be okay with that, they showed up to my house to argue that since they\u2019re paying for half the wedding (more like 30%) they deserve to have input on my wedding, which they have, but not for something like this ! More like catering options.\n\nMy fiance has been trying to badger me into just saying yes, saying it's selfish of me to not just give 25-30 minutes to his family.\n\nAnyways, with how my fiance has been acting, of course nobody in his family has been on my side - I\u2019m no contact with my family so I have no idea if this just just a case of family picking sides or if I\u2019m truly in the wrong here. Am I being self centered like they say?  \n\n\nedit : Someone said she deserves her own day and I agree, I'm a party/event planner, it's actually something I do professionally along with my day job.  I offered to help plan a good engagement/proposal party - they told me that it would be an unnessicary expense and that maybe I should chip into the party 50/50 since they chipped into my wedding if I'm too selfish to share what they gave me.

Of course you would balk at having this DISRUPTION at your own wedding. Yet another red flag is the age difference.

And your fiance green-lighted it. \n\nFlag 2: Complete disregard for your ideas and feelings. Your fiance did not even consult with you before agreeing. \n\nFlag 3: They are manipulative. They went behind your back and asked your fiance first. Your fiance is, in your words, \"badgering\" you to relent.\n\nFlag 4: They are just plain-fucking-crazy.

You're not even married yet, and they're already behaving like entitled, manipulative lunatics.", "NOOOOOOO NTA. Your f*ckin day! Your wedding! And how shitty of them to say his proposal was not satisfactory. AND TO WEAR YOUR DRESS AND HAVE FLOWERS. NO!", "NTA this is insane. This isn\u2019t even a \u201cnormal\u201d wedding proposal. She\u2019s taking over half your wedding. I\u2019m sorry, but if your future husband can\u2019t see the issue nor have a spine you need to rethink this marriage. This is a glimpse of you never coming first in his life when it comes to them. This is the most important day so far for you and he wants to give it up for his sister? Who\u2019s already engaged? Her man doesn\u2019t know her well enough to of done the proposal she wanted? Inviting more guests\u2026 a WEDDING DRESS? Girl, be prepared for them to sabotage this as a double wedding. If his mother wants to hold the money over your head offer to pay her back or tell her you\u2019ll do a courthouse wedding instead. This is last minute and they want to have tens of thousands dollar engagement. Screw them, and screw your man if he can\u2019t give you YOUR day", "NTA \nBut i say give them the day. The whole day. You won't need it after you dump that garbage fiance of yours", "What?!?! They already had the proposal, and now they want to stage it in your reception, inviting strangers to YOUR wedding reception, and use YOUR wedding dress for some stage up proposal? Are they for real?? Did your fiancee know all those details when he said you would be ok with all this? If he does, and is still on their side... Are you sure he is the love of your life? I mean... I'm always skeptical when people makes this kind of comment without knowing the other person at all but... he should be defending you. Not trying to convince you to say yes to this nonsense.\n\n\nEdit to add: NTA.", "NTA but think twice about joining this family.  Screw their money if there are strings attached. Do not start this marriage being bullied like this. A cool idea that would not have hijacked your wedding would have been to throw the bouquet so she could catch it then he could immediately go down on one knee and propose with the ring. Win win.

With someone else.", "NTA are you sure you want to marry in to this family?", "NTA, proposing at a wedding is a huge no-no and tacky as hell. \n\nFor your sake, please reconsider this wedding. Your fiance is never going to have your back. He has showed you that he's willing to badger you into accepting something that's rude and in poor taste, for the sake of his family. You'll always be his family's doormat. The age difference is a red flag (it wouldn't be if you were both 10 years older, but right now you're so young and predators are often attracted by women who are too young to realise they're being controlled). I know the idea of a wedding seems glamorous, but try to think about how your life will be after it.", "NTA.  You get one wedding day and you should be the star.", "NTA- but is this really the family you want to marry into? Even your fianc\u00e9e has put you on the back burner for his sister and mother. I can\u2019t imagine going through life being a second thought or feelings.", "NTA.  I'd also rethink your potential marriage.  Your fiance should be siding with you on an obvious issue.", "NTA.\n\nYou need to have a long serious conversation with your fiance.  First that he agreed to this at all with no discussion from you and second that he refuses to hear you out or get onside.\n\nI\u2019ll be honest: I would create a facebook post congratulating SIL on her engagement and then block all notifications.", " NTA but Holly shit. Rethink this marriage. Why would your fianc\u00e9 think this is ok. \n\nDo you realize this man is putting his family\u2019s wants and desires before you? Is this how you want to start off your life? \n\nHonestly he is on his best behavior now? What os he going to make you do for the sake of his family later on?\n\nIs mil going to get to name your kid? Are you going to be forced to let her in the delivery room? \n\nAnd the guilt and manipulation he is putting you through is abusive to make his dramatic sister happy. \n\nHe wants you to share the spotlight at a wedding you planned? He wants them to be able to rip your dress off to give it to his sister? He wants to use your flower girl?\n\nAnd who the hell makes thier fianc\u00e9 redo a perposal? I would highly suggest that dude run far and fast!\n\nHonestly if you marry this man you will forever be kissing his family\u2019s ass? You will never be able to tell them no about anything? He will always let them call the shots! He will never prioritize you or your life with him! \n\nThis is rude disrespectful and quite frankly narcissistic toxic family!\n\n\nSeriously dude run and take sil fianc\u00e9 with you!", "NTA. This is a huge red flag. Maybe you should postpone the wedding until you can pay for it yourselves, and more importantly, why doesn\u2019t your fianc\u00e9 have your back on this? Does he really not care about having the wedding be a special day for you? \n\nThere are only a few things that are absolute no-nos at a wedding, and one of those is someone else making any kind of big family announcement like a pregnancy or engagement. Another is someone else wearing a wedding dress. A wedding is about the bride and groom and that\u2019s it.", "NTA. This problem shows up here often and our answer will not change. \n\nNo. Absolutely not. This is your day. And your husband is completely wrong about it just being 25 minutes of your reception. If they do it, the entire remainder of the reception will be about them. If they open your reception with this, it will become her engagement party. Your reception will be forgotten.\n\nEspecially (and this is the tackiest and most arrogant thing I\u2019ve ever heard of) she borrows YOUR wedding dress. The gall of these two! Your wedding dress is worn by you, for the entire duration of your wedding and reception and no one else.\n\nAs I\u2019ve said, we\u2019ve seen this here before. But by taking your wedding dress, your flower girl, etc. this is a blatant attempt to take over your reception.\n\nUninvite these two. I wouldn\u2019t put it past them to try and pull this off anyway. Or, at the very least, make sure security stays with them at all times. If they so much as look at the mike, security stops them. If they grab the mike, make sure the DJ plays his loudest, most aggressive dance tune immediately and turns off the mike.", "NTA. That\u2019s a ridiculous request. Honestly I\u2019d be looking at my future spouse sideways if they didn\u2019t also think this is ridiculous. Your SIL can plan her own event if she wants her own attention. \n\nIt doesn\u2019t sound like they are considering your feelings at all. I know you said you aren\u2019t in contact with your family but I hope you have some friends on your side who you can talk to about this and who could maybe even help you to stand your ground.", "NTA. Uninvite MIL and SIL and fiance. Don't associate with people who think this demand is in any way reasonable.", "NTA, \n\nOh hell NO!\n\nEven asking you to do this is just tacky AF. Do not let them pull this stunt on you and please have some good friends on your side ready to pull them off the dance floor if they even try it at the reception.", "NTA. That's an incredibly tacky and inappropriate plan. There's no way I'd go along with it. \n\nJust as a heads up, your fiance and his family have no consideration for you and are going trample all over you and your feelings for as long as you stay married to him.", "It doesn't sound like your fiance is ready to get married. Being a good husband should be more important to him than being a good son and brother. Forsaking all others also means parents and siblings aren't the #1 priority anymore.\n\nWhat your ILs want would be humiliating, not only for you but for them. It is beyond inappropriate. SIL's desperate bid for attention at the expense of the bride, would shame the entire family. Guests and her new in-laws would likely be appalled. I cannot believe your fiance thinks this is a good idea. \n\nDon't be afraid to walk away before you make a lifelong commitment. It's not hard to fall out of love with a husband who never takes your side.", "NTA\n\nIt's your wedding day, getting upstaged is a shit move.  \n\nIt's your day, and being self centered on the wedding day is totally fine.\n\nThough Maybe something more toned down at the beginning of the reception, while you take a steamy limo ride, and then retake the spotlight and attention might work. \n\nBut it feels like the in-laws are pulling some inconsiderate BS", "NTA. That's a really weird request from his family.", "NTA - I\u2019d drug test the lot of them, I\u2019d almost hope they were under some influence to be batshit enough to have these grandiose levels of entitlement. \n\nDie on this hill. This is not normal and not something to back down on. If this wasn\u2019t bad enough, what comes next? They are making it clear that they don\u2019t care about your no, it doesn\u2019t matter, do not prove them right. \n\nOn top of it being incredibly rude, disrespectful and entitled they are lazy as hell for trying to steal\nwhat you\u2019ve planned and dreamed about. \n\nYour guests came there to see and celebrate you and your husband, not to watch a theatrical production of a proposal that ALREADY happened to someone else.", "OP you're right, you are so obviously NTA.\n\nYour SIL/MIL cornered you with a completely unreasonable request and tried to undermine your relationship with your fiance by going behind your back and pressuring him into it first. That was incredibly unfair of them and I'm sure left you feeling like you were being unreasonable - you're not. They sound like selfish narcissists and a little unhinged. Like, everyone knows it's poor taste to upstage the married couple on their wedding day?!! \n\nYour SIL's fiance did a rubbish job of proposing so now she wants to steal your thunder and use your wedding as her backdrop for her 'perfect instagram' proposal? No thank you. Guarantee all the guests will be cringing so hard if that happens. \n\nI'm guessing that your fiance is used to this kind of behaviour and is after a quiet life with limited drama from them. Sounds like he's repeating their words back to you as a defence to why it should just happen. I would suggest that you and Jim have a very plain discussion about why this is a boundary you're not willing to cross.\n\nWord of warning OP, by the sounds of them, SIL may try and stage it anyway and then feign all knowledge of it as if her fiance planned it in secret. \n\nBest of luck, hope that you have an awesome drama-free wedding!", "\"She would come out also wearing a wedding dress (???) - potentially my dress to cut costs - with my flower girl holding a sign that says \u201cbride to be\u201d and then of course, her being proposed to and carried off by her fiance out of the party.\"\n\nI don't know why, but the theme song from The Beverley Hillbillies came into my head when I read the above.\n\nNTA, but your fiance and his family sure are.

He\u2019s got to be playing stupid. If he doesn\u2019t back you up on the obvious no brainer, you\u2019re going to get desensitized and gaslit into violating your very reasonable boundaries for the rest of your life.

I really was conflicted about posting here, as I\u2019m scared of being bombarded with hate if I truly am in the wrong here - but at this point I just need to know. \r  \n\r  \nAITA for telling my soon to be sister in law, no, she cannot stage her proposal at my wedding reception? My wedding is in 2 months, so there is still time to change my answer and compromise if I am in the wrong. \r  \n\r  \nLast week my soon to be in-laws took me (22F)  out to dinner with my fiance Jim(31M). We were talking about wedding plans when suddenly SIL and MIL both say they have something important to discuss with me, and sorta giggle to each other like it was going to be some exciting little gossip. I figured it had to do with the bachelorette party so I got all excited too. They told me that SIL got proposed to over the weekend. I of course got all excited for her, asked to see the ring and all - very beautiful. \r  \n\r  \nThey then get a little hushed and tell me her fiance's proposal plan was rather lack-luster, and they\u2019re making him do a do-over with the family present. They then said that my wedding reception was the best place, since all our family and friends would be there.\r  \n\r  \nI asked them to tell me what exactly they had in mind, I mean I want to be the center of attention on my wedding day, it's what all girls dream of, but I was willing to at least hear the idea out. SIL would have to invite 3 of her friends, her future bridesmaids apparently, to be present - She would come out also wearing a wedding dress (???) with my flower girl holding a sign that says \u201cbride to be\u201d and then of course, her being proposed to and carried off by her fiance out of the party. \r  \n\r  \nOf course I was floored, and said I wasn\u2019t too sure if that\u2019s really a good idea and I\u2019d talk it over with Jim. They told me they already talked it out with him and he said he thought I would definitely agree. I texted him to not cause any more issues at the table and he confirmed. I said I would think about it just to get out of the awkwardness/pressure for the rest of the evening - but once I sent a text once again clarifying no, I wouldn\u2019t be okay with that, they showed up to my house to argue that since they\u2019re paying for half the wedding (more like 30%) they deserve to have input on my wedding, which they have, but not for something like this ! More like catering options.\r  \n\r  \nMy fiance has been trying to badger me into just saying yes, saying it's selfish of me to not just give 25-30 minutes to his family. \r  \n\r  \nAnyways, with how my fiance has been acting, of course nobody in his family has been on my side - I\u2019m no contact with my family so I have no idea if this just just a case of family picking sides or if I\u2019m truly in the wrong here.

You should not sacrifice yourself to his family, they will never say thank you, they only will blame you that \u201cthis is not enough, more!\u201d. \n\nGoogle closes to you support group of women who struggled from abusive relationships, just go there to group meeting and listen, some of their stories will remind you of your ex - fianc\u00e9", "Around the godamn wedding too. That's the best he will ever be. I wouldn't be done even being friends or dating someone who fucking went that far. I would never be in a relationship that wasn't purely sexual with someone who wouldn't side with me at least by respecting my feelings and supporting them. If you go as far as to objectively harm someone maybe they don't support, but this guy will never support her ever. Not s good person to be trapped with.", "You\u2019re the first one to mention this and I just can\u2019t get over that little bit. \n\nHe already proposed. They\u2019re already engaged.

I had mine and then when I got to victim\u2019s services at the county attorney\u2019s office they gave me money cards to pay for time on it till I could get established again.  \nLike said above, get all your legal papers together now and keep them safe - I carried mine around in my purse for a while.

You can find another job.  \n\nYou left one abusive family, and you're joining another... and this time it'll be even worse, because you have less legal protection as an adult.  Start researching your options.  Start a gofundme... \"Help me escape my nightmare wedding.\" might get attention, although I'm sure you could do better.  People might be sceptical, but... they might surprise you.\n\nYou need to take better care of yourself.  If you belong to a church, maybe there's help there.  Do you have friends, or have your IL's (and your fiance) prevented you from getting any (something abusers often do.) \n\nWhat resources you have available to you depend a lot on the country you're from... in Canada, I could find/suggest some, but I have no idea what's in the U.S.  But this I know... no matter how difficult things might be if you leave your fiance (and his family...) it'll be better than staying. Don't allow them to convince you that you need them. You don't.", "It'll only be too late if you end up on the morgue slab, which is how a lot of abusive relationships end, unfortunately. GET OUT ASAP. It's best to just run whenever you can, don't tell him or anyone connected to him. Get whatever money you can and go to the nearest women's shelter. All women's shelters that I know of will not let any adult men inside no matter what. Boys are ok because rhey need to be with their mom, but adult men often trigger the fight or flight response in the women.", "The fact you're considering it \"too late\" makes ke question if you're marrying him because you want to, or because you feel you have to. Take some time to really critically think over what you want here. Definitely don't marry a man that you don't want to, and with this story, I'd be leaning towards a no, if I was in your position. You're only in your early 20s, you got plenty of life ahead of you, and plenty of options. You do have a choice and it's not too late. If you marry and change your mind later, it'll be hell to sort out vs cutting it in the bud before the wedding. \n\nTo be clear, I'm not saying don't marry him, I'm saying make sure it is truly what you want. Good luck, op.", "EDIT: After reading additional OP comments, I'm convinced she's in a controlling relationship. OP, please do whatever it takes to make steps towards getting out.   \n\n\nBe careful and know it's NOT NORMAL for a partner to install tracking apps on your phone to see everything you do and where you are.\n\nIt's NOT NORMAL if he doesn't let you go out and do things/meet people without him or his proxies (e.g. his relatives, friends, etc.). See if you can go to school/hobby groups/church/volunteer work/etc. without him trying to tell you it's a bad idea.  \n\n\nI don't think he's wrong about your former friends and family due to substance issues. It's a easy hole to fall in so don't  be tempted to fall back to them.  \n\\~\\~\\~\n\nRegardless of whether you go through w/ this marriage or not (Don't get me wrong, I think that family is oddly inconsiderate and you may feel \"indebted\" to them. All that are red flags but I understand if it's going through or be homeless, homeless is not a good option either), it's extremely important to establish your financial stability.\n\nThis all entails:\n\n1. Getting your own bank accounts (savings and checking) and credit cards, separate from your fiance and anyone else. All you really need is an ID, an address, and go to the bank and fill in some forms to get all that started. There are some banks where you can do it all online and submit a copy of your ID through their portal. I've used [Ally.com](https://Ally.com) (online bank) for years and I like them a lot.\n2. Get your credit started. Look into credit unions to start as they tend to have little to no fees, more lenient in letting you get your first credit card, better interest rates in savings account and loans. Ultimately, you need to get your first credit card to start your credit. Do this while you're young or else it might be impossible later on in life. There's no going back (I never managed to figure it out for my mom) if you miss this window.\n3. If possible, go to school, learn a trade or skill (e.g. bar tending) that can make you better money. Better income and ability of you to keep this money separate from your fiance+shared accounts is key.\n4. Figure out a way to be able to send a portion of your pay checks to your new account.\\~\\~\\~\n\nTread carefully in all of this. If you're not sure what fiance thinks, you can send some feelers out to see what your fiance thinks about you having your own bank account. It will show whether his family's just weird and he's not controlling vs he's unhealthily controlling.\n\nIt may be normal that he's against it because of US customs and traditions of married couples to have everything together. (I know enough people who got screwed by this b/c their spouse went on spending sprees and other spouse didn't realize they blew through so much money and that's a story for later.) But that does not work to your advantage and need.\n\nConsider opening all the things above w/out telling him or making up a reason if he insists on needing to know why. You can always select to have all correspondences from your bank to be electronic and you manage it on a computer/phone.\n\n\"Honey, it would be good for me to try and build credit too in case we need to buy a house/car in the future! Honey, my lil savings account on the side is where I can buy you birthday/anniversary present without you seeing the transaction before I give you the present! It'll spoil the surprise!\"\\~\\~\\~\n\nMy advice is you're 22 so you're still young. There's still so much more adulting to learn and figure out. If you need the roof over your head while you figure it out, it's ok. Just make sure you be careful and constantly work towards your own financial stability. Everything in life costs money and you'll need more of it in your future whether it's because you want to have kids or start a business or just have enough to retire early.\n\nBest case scenario, you two find your happily ever after. But in the off chance that it doesn't work out 20 or 50 years later, you need to be able to have money stashed, a means to earn a living, and be able to get yourself out if it gets ugly.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGood luck and I hope everything turns out ok.", "agreed totally. horrific that people who _need help_ have to go through these ridiculous and nonsensical rules to \"allow them\" to post...", "If his Mother has that much control over him, then she will ultimately control the finances.", "OP needs to see this comment and read it through the eyes of a third person.
