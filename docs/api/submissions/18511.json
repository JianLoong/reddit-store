All is fine and well until yesterday right before he was leaving for the party that was at a bar and I got an unexpected call from my parents who also live out of state. I am a nurse so they were asking what they should do with my grandma who called them stating that she couldn't feel her foot and that she was in excruciating pain. I told them to take her to the ER immediately and they said she couldn't walk so I told them to call an ambulance. I called my husband right after and the last update that I gave him before his party was that they were transferring her to another hospital for emergency surgery for a life threatening condition. I was waiting anxiously at home when the surgery was taking way longer than expected (>3 hours). My husband hadn't checked in at all. I got a text from a number that I didn't know that was a drunk selfie of some guy and my husband, with zero context. I texted my husband and said that I was worried sick about my grandma and didn't appreciate getting texted drunk selfies from random people. Heard nothing. After an hour I texted the random number and asked if my husband's phone had died and he said \"Yes \ud83d\ude02\".\n\nHere's where I may be TA, I texted back \"Cool, my grandma is still in emergency surgery \ud83d\ude02\". I never got a reply to this. About 4 hours later when my grandma survived and was transferred to the ICU I texted my husband how much he had let me down. This turned into a fight where he believes that he he did no wrong because \"I knew he was looking forward to this party for two months and he couldn't do anything anyway\". I blew up and told him how irresponsible it was for him to get drunk and let his phone die while I was alone with our baby during a family emergency. He apologized for not \"checking in more\" to which I corrected that he didn't check in at all (not even the next morning) and he says that he \"Did his due diligence in making himself reachable\" and I said that a random number texting me a drunk selfie does not count as him telling me that his phone was dead and that's how I should reach him. He said the name of the bar in passing a few times but I couldn't remember the name and I did not know the name of his hotel.  He says I'm just overreacting and it's not a big deal because \"it's not like he could do anything from another state\" and that he did no wrong, seeing his friends was important to him and a lot of them he hasn't seen in 15 years and that he shouldn't have to disrupt his plans to \"cater to me\". I didn't ask him to take the next flight home just be available or communicate that he wasn't. I told him that I was afraid and he could have at least checked to see if I was okay and that it also isn't okay to let your phone die when someone else has your child even without an emergency. So, AITA for flipping out on him?\n\nETA that the emergency happened right before the party so he was sober at that time and aware that the situation was touch and go. I called him immediately after I had my parents call 911.", "created_utc": 1685405984, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13vb50g/aita_for_flipping_out_on_my_husband_via_text/", "score": 8288, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Obviously I couldn\u2019t go anymore but he did. \n\n3 hours later, when I was off work, I got a call from my mom who was rushing my dad to the ER for heart issues (he had a double by pass about a year ago and the signs were a possible heart attack) \n\nI was so panicked. This is my dad. Even though my dad is older, and not in the best health, the thought of losing him I can\u2019t handle. Of course I know one day, I will. It\u2019s how life works. \n\nAnyway. In my state I was so tunnel vision. I called my husband over and over and over. Like, if he was here this wouldn\u2019t be happening type thinking. Which is so absurd. \n\nTo me, it didn\u2019t matter he was on a boat, around water and didn\u2019t have his phone in his hand. I was angry. At him. \n\nIt was so silly of me. \n\nI knew where he was. What he was doing. Looking back, I can see I reacted so badly towards my husband. No one can predict an emergency, so he wasn\u2019t spending his time like one would happen. \n\nI was scared and afraid for my dad, and that turned into anger towards my husband. \n\nIt\u2019s normal to feel out of control when something like this happens. It was your grandmother, she was far away. You couldn\u2019t do anything but wait. \nAs a nurse, I\u2019m sure you wanted to do more for her. \n\nI was an asshole for how I treated my husband and I think YTA for how you treated yours.", "YTA\n\nInstead of **calling** the random number when they confirmed that 1) they were with your husband and 2) yes, his phone was dead, you decided to send a sarcastic, passive-aggressive text?\n\nYou had the means to get ahold of your husband right then and there.  Call that number, ask them to pass the phone to your husband.\n\nOtherwise, like others pointed out, you had other sources of support.  I will never understand the mentality that partners need to be reachable 24/7.  \u201cWhat if an emergency comes up?\u201d - You are an adult.  Do what you would do if they weren\u2019t there (which is exactly what you did anyway).\n\nIf it really is so important to you that you always have a way of contacting your husband, then why *didn\u2019t* you know the name of his hotel?  Of the bar?  Why did this only come up after the fact, and why is it **his** fault that you didn\u2019t know it?  You\u2019re an adult who can ask for this info at any time.", "YTA - sorry, but I never get this outlook. What exactly did your husband need to do here? If you needed him home, you should have told him. Otherwise why does he have to ruin his night.", "I keep flipping between ESH and NAH. It does suck that you couldn't reach him, but I can't imagine you failed to understand what would happen if he went to a meetup out of state? He should've been available, but at the same time should he REALLY be on call? If you feel that way, why did you okay it in the first place?", "You are mis-directing your anger.", "I want to connect with a no judgment here thought. \n\nMy grandma was a tent pole in my life and did everything she could for her grandkids. When the health scares started, I had a lot of panic. I had moved to the east coast and my family and grandma were in Arizona. Time and time again, I had to make the active decision between traveling home during COVID or trusting in the resources and health services in Arizona. \n\nFrom the initial issues to her passing, it covered about 18 months. The health care system handled the immediate (like they did with your grandma), and it all turned out okay. There was a point where I knew it wasn\u2019t going to get better and my husband and I spent a month in Arizona while she was in hospice and until she was finally able to rest in her home for the last time. \n\nThe timeline was staggering. Everytime, it brought panic to me, but not every time warranted a visceral reaction or trip out there. \n\nYou are clearly upset because you needed someone to talk to that you loved and trusted, and I\u2019m sorry that he wasn\u2019t there for you because of his trip. I hope you can rest easier knowing that she is okay right now. \n\nFrom the title, he did reach out in his own way, but could have done more. I\u2019m not going to make excuses for him, but in the morning, could he have still be sleeping from a long night out or didn\u2019t plug in his phone?\n\n[An Edit] With how fast phones charge now with their bricks, he could have easily have been like \u201chey guys, give me 15 minutes or I\u2019ll meet you at the bar\u201d and had enough to carry him through. He made bad decisions towards his availability.", "YTA, what were you going to do a state away from Grandma?  What was your husband supposed to do?  It sounds like you weren't comfortable with him going and used this as an excuse to be pissed.  Of course, he was having fun. It's a reunion.  Did you have a contingency plan for incase, like IL or friends?  I think you are hard on this one.", "ESH, but with a balance towards YTA.\n\nHe should\u2019ve told you his phone was dying, but a) you had other avenues of emotional support - call your parents. B) you supported him going interstate for the purposes of a college reunion (aka getting drunk) and that does actually entail taking responsibility of being alone and self sufficient, physically, mentally and emotionally.", "Sounds like you were not happy that he went to this reunion and you were going to do anything you could to interrupt him.  \n\nThere was nothing he could do but you being a nurse would know that.", "YTA\n\nIt\u2019s coming off like you were unhappy he went away for the weekend. All the other stuff is padding your reason for your original concern of your grandmother. She was better within a few hours, but you have managed to make this an actual problem for your marriage.", "YTA. You\u2019re blaming him for your grandmother being sick. You knew where he was, you could have found him if you wanted to.", "Idk why you\u2019re getting so many downvotes.  \n\nWhile i can see that he couldn\u2019t have done anything from another state, i can also see that it would have been nice of him to have let you know that his phone was dead and you can text his friend if you need him. Also to not hear from him the next morning is upsetting. Is it correct that he didn\u2019t know if your grandma was ok or not before he went to bed? That is all not really ok imo. \n\nNTA is my final verdict. Your partner should care about you enough to check in, despite not being able to do anything for you. Sometimes \u201cdoing something\u201d isn\u2019t what\u2019s needed, but instead being supportive.", "What exactly was your husband supposed to do? Your grandma\u2019s being sick wasn\u2019t his fault and there was nothing he could\u2019ve done. \n\nAs the person who was at home you\u2019re the one whose phone line was crucial. You need to be able to call emergency services for you or your child. Your husband who was on holiday was in no situation to help you out either at home or with your grandmother.\n\nYTA", "YTA. Him knowing about your grandma and the situation would not have helped you in the least. The timing of it was unfortunate. It would have been *preferable* to have your husband\u2019s support in the moment. But he was reasonably unavailable and that is not a failure on his part.", "You guys are heartless, individualistic assholes. \nThey are a family, he is a partner and a father first, the least he should have done is check in as soon as he knew what was happening and apologize for missing communication earlier. This is the minimum expectation for an adult partner with a small child at home.\n\nNTA wishing your grandma a speedy recovery. I can only imagine how alone and scared you must've felt and then the disrespectful drunk selfie on top of that. Your husband should be feeling mortified and needs to properly apologize and show support.", "I don't understand all the \" y t a\" my boyfriend just had a life threatening family emergency were in the same state but it was more than hour away from me to help him, but I had my phone on me all day, I charged my smart watch to make sure if he called or needed to reach me I would be there. When scary things happen you want to know the person you love is willing to drop everything and be there even if not physically, that's why u choose them to be your partner through thick and thin. And he dropped the ball. NTA.", "So confused about all the Y T A votes. If I was in her partners shoes, I would have checked in more with her. And while yes, there is nothing he could have done from that far away, he still could have provided emotional support which she clearly needed. Also, like why send a drunk selfie, seriously? Like she needed to see that when she\u2019s stressing out about an emergency with her loved one? NTA. \n\nGlad your grandma is doing okay.", "NTA - its not like you were asking him to drop everything and come home, you just wanted him to be contactable and to see if you're ok due to your family emergency.  Also, what if it was your baby that had the emergency, your husband should've made sure his phone was fully charged while away from home when you have small children.", "INFO: what about your husband being drunk made his phone die? What could he have done to prevent his phone from dying once he was already out and the surgery went longer than expected?\n\nOverall, seems like YTA. Soft, because you were upset about a family emergency, but it\u2019s not like there was a lot he could do.\n\nEither you needed him to come home, and you should have said so, or you didn\u2019t need him and shouldn\u2019t grief him about enjoying his night out.", "NTA\n\nI'm concerned about the number of Y T A on this post. It's almost as if they don't have real partners, have never had an emergency, or didn't actually read your post? I don't know. But it's really the bare minimum to ask your partner, the person who is supposed to care for you more than anyone else in your life, to at least have their phone on during an emergency. \n\n>he didn't check in at all (not even the next morning)\n\nLike this. My partner would be concerned and would definitely have checked in on me and asked for updates. I probably would have first had to convince them not to immediately start driving home. There was a grave chance that your grandmother was going to pass away. Your partner should want to be there for you if this were to happen. Even if he didn't want to/couldn't drive home, asking him to be available on the phone is the bare minimum. \n\n>disrupt his plans to \"cater to me\".\n\nThis was really shitty. I would really start to reflect on my relationship if my partner thought that supporting me when a close family member was in danger of passing away was \"catering\". Like wtf. \n\nMy partner is my best friend. If someone I cared about passed away, I would want to talk to him first and instinctively. And he *wants* to be the one I call and wants to be the one to support me and vice versa.\n\nETA: typo", "NTA .. your husband acting like he doesn\u2019t give a fuck is the A H here \n\nWhile it\u2019s true there\u2019s nothing he could tangibly do, he could show a minuscule amount of concern for your feelings", "ESH. He definitely should have let you know his phone was dying, and checked in with you the next morning. But you also should have taken down the name of the hotel if you were so concerned about being able to reach him. And you didn't need to try to guilt him while he was out having fun, when there was nothing he could have actually done.", "NTA. A supportive partner is someone who checks in regularly during a stressful and scary situation like this. Also, there was the real chance your family would need to be with your grandmother. I honestly can't imagine being able to get hammered and have a great time with old friends when I know my wife is home worried with our 1 year old. To get a drunk selfie is incredibly disrespectful.", "YTA.  What, exactly, we\u2019re you wanting your husband to do?  Sit by the hotel phone waiting for you to call incase granny kicked it?   There is nothing he or you could have done in this situation except sit around and wait.  You had a way to contact him.", "YTA- there was nothing you could do. And even less that he could do.", "YTA - Basically, if he has to be on a tether to you 24/7/365, no personal life at all (this was a planned event for two plus months) then something is seriously wrong  with this relationship.", "NTA- been in a similar situation. The first person I called was my husband. I needed comfort, reassurance and just to be heard. I am sorry you did not have that experience. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s to much to ask him to step out of party mode to shoot you a text to check in after learning about your grandma. When you have a family you don\u2019t get to check out to suit your needs. Same with parenting. Sheesh.", "YTA. Annoyed yes, fighting over it, no.", "NTA since he was sober when he first heard about the situation. Getting drunk with buddies v. supporting your partner in a family emergency?  He's old enough to know better, and he could have used his friend's phone to check in on you, and nobody needs to get incoherent drunk at his age.  What a jerk.", "NTA. You needed your partner for emotional support, and he was not there for you. Not saying he couldn\u2019t go to his party, but he should have checked in with you.", "YTA", "No one\u2019s TA. Could you have written down the hotel and bar? Yea. Could he have checked in on you and charged his phone? definitely. Emotions are high when navigating the first year of a baby\u2019s life. Give yourself and him a little compassion, and recognize what could improve in future chaotic events.", "I was so ready to call you the a hole until your husband opened his mouth \ud83d\ude02. It\u2019s not really his fault his phone died during the emergency. As you said he found out right before he was leaving and by then it was to late to make sure it was charged. Although traveling he should be making sure it\u2019s charged anyway. You get the NTA vote because you didn\u2019t blow up on him about the phone. You blew up on him about his action afterwards and his response to you.", "NTA. I get that it was his reunion but he is supposed to be your partner and support you. I don\u2019t think a text every couple of hours would\u2019ve killed his party. It\u2019s also super irresponsible to have his phone die, what if something happens to him? I\u2019d be pissed off at my husband too, worried about him. Though you should probably know the hotel name\u2026", "NTA\nWhat if something had happened to your baby?\nIt doesn\u2019t matter that he can\u2019t do anything from where he is, he could\u2019ve contacted you or checked in on you \nI guess next time an emergency happens dont even let him know because apparently it doesn\u2019t matter", "NTA. I understand there is nothing he could do, but you were obviously in distress. At the very least he should\u2019ve checked in with you before bed and the next morning. I do think the fight is blown a bit out of proportion, but I definitely understand the frustration", "NTA but there are a lot of asshole commenters. anyone saying grandparents aren\u2019t immediate family on this thread must come from some perfect nuclear family situation or their GPs were long dead and they never knew them or had a relationship with them. not everyone\u2019s family looks the same, and some people were raised by their grandparents. so using that in an argument about this is just disrespectful to OP and any other person who has a close relationship with their grandparent(s).", "YTA. The term \"family emergency\" is a little misleading. It stopped being an emergency when your grandmother was admitted to the hospital and transferred into the care of appropriate medical professionals.\n\nWhy did you feel the need to provide active updates to your husband? Why does he need to know if the surgery is taking longer than usual or if she's being transferred to another hospital? What was your husband supposed to do with that information? He was literally in another state.\n\nYou're angry because he got drunk at a college reunion when you have a baby at home and a family emergency? Did you two have a baby when you decided you were okay with him going to this reunion? And if so, did you establish boundaries that he wouldn't get drunk? Why would he stay completely sober once you told him your grandma was in the hospital? What would he be able to do?\n\nYou need to get your FOMO in check. You were clearly under a lot of stress with your grandma in the hospital, and you resented your husband because he was off having fun\u2014like you two had planned. So you text him pointless updates and get mad when he has spotty responses, and then create this whole straw man where he looks irresponsible for drinking during a \"family emergency\" (in quotes because it's not really an emergency), and because \"you're alone at home with the baby.\" You don't like getting drunk texts from random numbers while gma is in the hospital? Well, he probably doesn't like you trying to ruin his night from afar by pretending there's something he should be doing to help the situation.\n\nIf you didn't want to be home alone with the baby while your husband goes to another state to drink, then you should have thought about that before you said you were okay with him going. Your husband has done nothing wrong", "YTA- Your husband is in a different state, and your parents and granda are also.... in a different state. You and him couldn't do anything to help. Having your husband at your beckond call while you knew he was drunk and out with friends was a way to manipulate. \n\nI understand you were worried, but if you needed comfort and information, then you should have been talking to your parents. \n\nThe most your husband could have done was say, \"How's it going? Are you okay?\" And I do NOT believe that would have satisfied you and made you happy. If it really was as simple as wanting that type of text from him then you are massively blowing this up", "NTA; your husband knew that your grandmother was in crisis and that you were worried about her BEFORE he got drunk, and he didn't set up any backup ways for you to reach him for support, he didn't bother to check in with you at all even the next morning when he was sober and apart from his friends... It must have been so wildly painful to receive a drunk selfie from a stranger's phone number with a laughing-crying emoji when you were reaching out for any kind of support from your partner. Like you said, you just asked for him to be available OR communicate that he wasn't, and it's not a crazy ask to want the father of your one-year-old to be available by phone in the midst of an emergency anyway.\n\n I'm sorry you went through that, and I hope your grandmother is recovering.", "NTA, it\u2019s messed up that everyone seems to be focussing on how grandma didn\u2019t die, it\u2019s not his problem, and he couldn\u2019t have done anything anyway. The main issue is being available during emergencies, what if it was about his own baby? And don\u2019t say \u2018well, it wasn\u2019t\u2019 because that really does not justify being unable to be contacted at all. A random drunk selfie notwithstanding, I sincerely do not believe that he couldn\u2019t have found a way to recharge his phone if he wanted to. And anyone who is blaming OP about not asking where he\u2019s going or where he\u2019s staying, this is not on her only. Her husband could\u2019ve told her himself as well so putting blame on her is just the sexist way of putting everything on the women in relationships.", "NTA. You didn\u2019t need to flip out, but you have every right to be upset that he irresponsibly let his phone die and didn\u2019t check in. Cater to you? You\u2019re his wife and there with his child. You should be his priority. No he couldn\u2019t have done anything, and it wasn\u2019t an emergency with you or your child, but he could have at least responded in a timely manner once to let you know he was sorry she was in surgery and to keep him updated. Did he need to keep texting every five minutes? No and nobody is saying that", "YTA. He wasn\u2019t unreachable, and there was nothing he could\u2019ve done anyway. You want to keep insisting he was rude, disrespectful and unsupportive. Sounds like deeper issues than a dead phone at a reunion.", "Idk about other couples but my husband and I have a levels of emergency things. You nor your child were dying, nor were either of your parents. There\u2019s nothing he could have done and providing updates would suffice. \n\nYTA. He was on a trip out of town. It wasn\u2019t an emergency that necessitated him return immediately and you could provide the necessary updates via text.", "NTA. Your husband didn't need to come home or really make any changes to his plans other than show some courtesy. Checking in and offering words of comfort is not too much to expect. It's actually the bare minimum.", "YTA. \n\nThere's absolutely nothing your husband could do in this situation. I always suggest letting the Dr's at the hospital do their jobs, instead of worrying about someones dead cell phone. You are a pita.", "YTA. In all honesty you\u2019re probably misplacing your fear over something you had no control over (your grandma) into anger towards your husband because you had to deal with the mess but he was out having fun. He wasn\u2019t totally unreachable. You could\u2019ve called the number and explained the situation. But like everyone else was saying there is nothing else you or your husband could\u2019ve done other than to wait for news. You owe him an apology imo", "YTA", "YTA, you need other people in your life that can offer emotional support. Sure your hubby can be the main strength you turn to, but he can\u2019t always be there. You need girlfriends, family, whatever. This includes if the baby is sick or something, which you keep throwing in like it\u2019s *the absolute worst* ohmygod what if the baby was sick and you couldn\u2019t reach him?? Guess what, shizz like that happens in life. Get a stronger circle of mommy friends and family so you can cope when hubby is away or busy or working.", "YTA", "NTA. There was nothing he could do to help with the situation with your grandmother, but he has a spouse and a *baby,* and needed to be reachable in case there was an emergency with you or your child...and honestly, I just went to my ten-year reunion, and I can't imagine wanting to go out and party all night and let my phone die if I knew my partner was home waiting to hear whether her grandmother was going to make it, especially if we also had a baby that she was caring for alone! You didn't ask him to come home or not have fun. He was insensitive, didn't seem to support you at all, and was irresponsible and should have given you a CLEAR way to reach him. Apart from the lack of support for you, he's not 21 and carefree anymore, he has a baby, and he should be reachable.", "NTA, husband is TA", "So was he going to the grandma state and preform surgery himself? He a doctor?. You didn't want him to go. You are manipulating this situation to never let him have a break... Do you even care about grandma?. People still need to be individuals even when their married.", "YTA, it wasn't a family emergency.  You and your son are fine and so were both sets of parents. Grandparents are extended family, he couldn't do anything anyways. If something happened to you or your child or the inlaws or parents that would be a different story.", "YTA", "Wait - he hadn't bothered to tell you what hotel he was staying in??? In addition to letting his phone die?\n\nHonestly, that sounds to me like he decided he was \"off the leash\" on this trip and that he was essentially going to act like he had no real life responsibilities. It would have been nice for him to be there to give you emotional support and to be available for brainstorming in case the emergency escalated but the thing that's getting me is \\*he didn't tell you where he was\\*.\n\nAny time I go on a trip, I make sure my family knows where I'm going (in email, not verbal) and how to contact me if they can't reach my phone. It's just the adult, considerate thing to do.\n\nEdit: NTA", "YTA what could've he done if the phone didn't die? Is he a doctor? Is he close enough to physically check in on her? No you're being ridiculous", "YTA.", "YTA I understand that you were scared, but he\u2019s right he would not have been able to anything and I think he had a right to enjoy the moment!!", "nta, i understand why you'd be upset that you can't reach your partner in an emergency where your feelings are running high. but at the same time, your husband probably didn't purposefully let his phone die.", "Let's see. Family emergency that ou couldn't even get to, because its out of state...and you're mad because he was out for something thats been long planned, and he wouldnt have been able to help with either...and a battery died so you couldn't...play by play the emergency that you weren't there for either.\n\nAnd you got a drunk selfie from an unknown number and threw a hissy fit about it?\n\nYta", "NTA Forget your grandma for a minute.

Read [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq#wiki_post_deletion) before [contacting the mod team](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAmItheAsshole)***\n\nSo I (34F) and my husband (35M) had a plan this weekend that he would be the next state over for a college reunion while I stayed home with our 1 year old baby. All is fine and well until yesterday right before he was leaving for the party that was at a bar and I got an unexpected call from my parents who also live out of state. I am a nurse so they were asking what they should do with my grandma who called them stating that she couldn't feel her foot and that she was in excruciating pain. I told them to take her to the ER immediately and they said she couldn't walk so I told them to call an ambulance. I called my husband right after and the last update that I gave him before his party was that they were transferring her to another hospital for emergency surgery for a life threatening condition. I was waiting anxiously at home when the surgery was taking way longer than expected (>3 hours). My husband hadn't checked in at all. I got a text from a number that I didn't know that was a drunk selfie of some guy and my husband, with zero context. I texted my husband and said that I was worried sick about my grandma and didn't appreciate getting texted drunk selfies from random people. Heard nothing. After an hour I texted the random number and asked if my husband's phone had died and he said \"Yes \ud83d\ude02\".\n\nHere's where I may be TA, I texted back \"Cool, my grandma is still in emergency surgery \ud83d\ude02\". I never got a reply to this. About 4 hours later when my grandma survived and was transferred to the ICU I texted my husband how much he had let me down. This turned into a fight where he believes that he he did no wrong because \"I knew he was looking forward to this party for two months and he couldn't do anything anyway\". I blew up and told him how irresponsible it was for him to get drunk and let his phone die while I was alone with our baby during a family emergency. He apologized for not \"checking in more\" to which I corrected that he didn't check in at all (not even the next morning) and he says that he \"Did his due diligence in making himself reachable\" and I said that a random number texting me a drunk selfie does not count as him telling me that his phone was dead and that's how I should reach him. He said the name of the bar in passing a few times but I couldn't remember the name and I did not know the name of his hotel.  He says I'm just overreacting and it's not a big deal because \"it's not like he could do anything from another state\" and that he did no wrong, seeing his friends was important to him and a lot of them he hasn't seen in 15 years and that he shouldn't have to disrupt his plans to \"cater to me\". I didn't ask him to take the next flight home just be available or communicate that he wasn't. I told him that I was afraid and he could have at least checked to see if I was okay and that it also isn't okay to let your phone die when someone else has your child even without an emergency. So, AITA for flipping out on him?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "So reading the opening I thought it was going to be something happened to you or your child and you couldn\u2019t get a hold of him when he was needed. In this situation, I\u2019m not sure what you needed from him or how he could\u2019ve helped?", "NAH. Was your husband insensitive to your emotions at the time when he sent that picture? Yes. Are you upset and maybe misplacing your feelings into anger towards your husband? Yes. \n\nI think both of you probably mishandled the situation. It would have been best if he had sent a text like, \u201chey my phone died here\u2019s this buddies number\u201d but he was drunk, and not being sensitive. And I\u2019m sure you\u2019re feeling unsupported because of this so you were snarky. \n\nI\u2019d say NAH, but definitely one of the situations where you hurt your spouse unintentionally and both of you should apologize to each other.", "I dk maybe NAH? I get why you would want emotional support given that you were scared for your grandma and that him sending you drunk selfies is annoying. I think he should\u2019ve gone out and made a point to check in every couple hours with sincerity/concern and not drunk antics. However, you also seem to have overreacted. \n\nKnowing he was going to be drunk, I probably would\u2019ve looked to others for the support you were looking for \u2014 like the rest of your family. He\u2019s right that besides consoling you, which is going to be minimal anyway while he\u2019s so far away, there isn\u2019t much he can do. I think you both could stand to cut each other some slack honestly.", "No judgement but, when I have bad news I tend to wait for a face to face when passing it on. I wouldn\u2019t want to stress someone who is out of town and on a fun trip when I know all they can do is stress over it.\n\nYou were stressing. You also were able to get updates regularly. You could talk to your mom and dad while they also waited and stressed.\n\nThe friends phone confirmed your hubby\u2019s phone wasn\u2019t charged. You paid for the event and knew he was at the event. \n\nYou could have left a message on his phone for him to call you once his phone was recharged and then left it at that.\n\nSitting and stressing was all that was going on. I know and have been through it with my mom. \n\nSurgery, you sit and stress. You wait. Your nervous. \n\nBut I don\u2019t think you should have texted that unknown phone about anything regarding your grandma. You asked about hubby\u2019s phone and they answered.\n\nI hope you apologize to the phone owner. Tell them you weee stressed and not thinking.\n\nApologize to your hubby for being short. He should be understanding. \n\nThis can all be resolved peacefully!\n\nI\u2019m glad your grandma is doing better and that the surgery went well. Concentrate on the positive.", "NTA", "Gently, yta. I get that you were scared and wanted him to be there for you. But the fact is he was drunk in another state and there was no comfort he could have offered from his party, drunk off his ass.

Ya know, like a grown-up.

Just to let my sweetheart know I love them. Ridiculous not to make any contact.", "I am sorry OP but here, YTA.  Nobody controls when a family emergency is gonna occur.  Just chill out and handle what you can.  I know it's hard, from a mom who's been there, but like.... You gotta let him have breathing room.  ESPECIALLY if you want the same breathing room in the future.  Men & women are so different.  Not only communication styles, but friendships, family relations, etc.  Just let it go and try to set more clear expectations in the future.  Are you REALLY even mad at him?  Or are you flustered at the whole grandma situation and expect him to drop everything to comfort you?  But him a portable phone charger for his birthday if you like but let this one go, as long as he is otherwise decent, kind and responsible.", "Fucking hell OP, learn to communicate like an adult. If you wanted your husband to come home, that should have been articulated. You had a line of communication to him via a buddy of his so all you had to do was call that number and ask to speak to your husband. Your husband isn't wrong in saying there was nothing he could do about your grandmothers condition.\n\nYTA", "YTA.  If you really needed him, call or text the number you already think is him and say \"there's an emergency, I to speak to <husband's name> and then tell him \"I need you home.\"  You also apparently had the ability to tell him you needed him home and not to go. You did not, nor did you try to notify him that things changed for you after you let him go.

I don\u2019t care if I get downvoted. It\u2019s not a problem of the phone dying. It\u2019s the texts. They\u2019re just gross in this situation. Partners should be the first support not last. He can have his fun and still be cognizant of your emotions. I cannot imagine acting like that if my grandmother in law (either of them) was in surgery. \n\nMy fianc\u00e9 knows first hand how terrifying it is to suddenly not have contact with me. He knew I was sick I\u2019d passed out and stopped texting while he was at a Christmas party. He had his fun there then pushed to get home as fast as he could. An hour later i had been in a coma.

I think you're justified in feeling upset in what you're going through and like you felt let down by your husband. But I think your husband is justified in saying he couldn't have done much, needed this release, and feels like what he did was sufficient given his distance, your previous plans, and what info you were able to give him at the tome. What would make either of you assholes is if you don't have a conversation, like adults, about how you might prefer things to go differently should this happen again. \n\nAnd I get that you're going through a lot but you'd be TA if you didn't acknowledge that you're actually directing the feelings of anxiety and fear about your grandma at your husband and how out of control you felt in that moment.", "I don't think you're an asshole. This is your husband, not just some random friend. Your grandmother was in a position she could have died, your husband should of at least had the decency to charge his phone. My husband is a respiratory therapist and stepped away from the floor to talk to me on the phone after my grandmother passed away just to make sure i was okay. He is supposed to be your support person. He didn't have to leave the party but he could have shown you some consideration. No party is more important than leaving your spouse alone and scared for.", "NTA. I don't think that expecting your husband to be reachable and sober enough *not to send you a drunken selfie while you are at the hospital waiting for surgery to be over* is outlandish\n\nReading the comments made me think I might have misread the original post. Nope. So then I go back to the comments. Am I losing my mind here?\n\nSince when is \"person having a good time with friends\" more important than \"family member undergoing lifesaving surgery\" ??\n\nShe didn't even ask him to stay. Only that he stay reachable, and possibly send a couple of texts asking \"how are things? Oh, still waiting? Hang in there. It will work out. Love you. Keep me posted\"\n\nI would have been so pissed your texts seem tame to me. I guess that makes me an AH according to everyone here. \n\nI can live with that. At least I'm not the kind of person that can completely forget their spouse's fear and sadness and go party their ass off.", "Nta. You needed his emotional support and he was too busy having fun. He sucks.", "YTA\n\nHe was having fun as planned and unfortunately there was a family emergency\n\nNeither of you could have predicted that\n\nYou were understandably upset because you had to wait alone to see if she\u2019d be okay.

This was the time to rely on your own friends and family if you needed it and let him still have his very rare outing. If it were just a local having drinks with friends and watching a game ok then I'd be like he could have come home and been with you but this was a big deal to him. He hadn't seen some of these people in 15 years. It doesn't deserve to be disturbed for your grandma.

It's unfair. It's hard to get over too when you're caught up on the simple fact you're married entitles you to his full unconditional support whenever it's wanted.

It\u2019s a stressful time and you wanted your husband to be available immediately to give you some comfort. But just because you want that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s going to happen. I want a lot of things. Part of life is understanding that reality just doesn\u2019t work out perfect all the time. You knew he was going to a reunion, and I would hope you would hope he has fun. That\u2019ll involve drinking and hey sometimes you get a little ahead of yourself. There\u2019s absolutely nothing he could have done and he was probably really hoping to see his old friend and have a blast. Your grandmothers situation is incredibly unfortunate and I\u2019m sure your husband would have been ready to give comfort and support when available. But it is something you are dealing with. My partners grandmother is going through health scares and I know it\u2019s been eating her up.

You sent your husband off to an out-of-state reunion, i.e. a bender. He got drunk. It was clear when you got the selfie that he was drunk. So you needed to put on your big girl pants and deal with your own shit. If you need a shoulder to cry on, call your mom or a friend. In fact, you should have been commiserating with your family throughout the emergency. For some context, many of us moms have husbands that are overseas for months at a time on military postings. Others of us have husbands who travel for weeks at a time for work. Or maybe there's the occasional fishing trip with his guy pals. Different timezones make communication difficult. Sometimes you have to handle things. It's part of being a grown up. If you need 24/7 access to a sympathetic ear then you need to cultivate some friends.", "And if it HAD been an emergency with the baby, he still would've been a state over and unable to get to the hospital immediately.

It's hard, but you need to approach it with balance instead of a sense of entitlement", "Also, none of that was communicated to him until after? Probably should approach things like this when you're not emotionally charged. Think about all of the things that should have been communicated before he even left.

Would you want him to withdraw from his party waiting for your call/update? \n\nYou are angry he was at a party when your grandma was hospitalized, and that's a misplaced anger.

As I said to another comment, if you\u2019re calling this woman the asshole then you are not ready for a relationship yourself because you are not capable of being selfless, and putting yourself in someone else\u2019s shoes.

What if HE had an emergency in a city he hasn't visited in a hot minute and had no way to reach out for help? Thats fairly reckless on his part. \n\nSecond, once he found out what was happening, he should have been prepared to be your point person BECAUSE HE'S YOUR LIFE PARTNER. Being present and willing to offer emotional support isn't \"catering to you\", it's the basis of a healthy relationship. You easily could have MUTUALLY established that there wasn't much he could do from his end, and he should instead enjoy his night out while checking in at whatever intervals seemed appropriate, given Nana's condition. Instead, he (at best) was generally negligent enough as to become unavailable and (at worst) just turned his phone off and placed an additional hurdle to make it challenging to communicate. \n\nThird, what is this shit about YOU should have called HIM once some random drunk-texted you? He knows FULL WELL you're in the middle of an extremely stressful situation, and he can't be bothered to call and explain what's happening?

Even if he had never met my Granny, he would be calling to get updates and checking in with me. He would be genuinely ASKING me what he could do to help, even if the answer was just listening. And you know what? I would likely vent my anxiety and fear and then acknowledge there wasn't really anything more for him to do, so he should enjoy his party and check in with me in the morning. Because he would earnestly seek to meet my needs, I could do the same for him. Instead, your husband sought to dismiss your needs to fulfill his own. That's an asshole move if I've ever seen one.\n\nETA: Him doubling down with dismissing your upset is also pretty shitty and part of my vote. Adults are responsible for both their intention and effect. Even if he didn't intend to hurt you, he did, and it's pretty obvious why. Dismissing instead of acknowledging isn't good. Literally all it would taken is, \"I see now you just wanted my emotional support, and I'm sorry I didn't get to give you that.

How do you need me to be there for you under similar circumstances?\" \n\nIf he won't discuss this calmly, and won't admit culpability, I suggest couples therapy; maybe a third, objective, party could help him to understand your feelings of betrayal, and you can both start to heal from this.", "OP, I hope your grandma is doing okay.

Sure it was an accident that he let his phone die, and he was drunk and obviously wasn't thinking properly because of it. This however does not excuse the fact that he was not there for you in such a dire emergency, he shouldn't have gotten so trashed, but he did and that was his choice to make. He left your guys' baby with you in another state. This alone should be a reason enough why he should always have an open and ready method to communicate with you, and a clearly communicated backup just in case. What if something had happened to your child instead? Would he be willing to die on a hill like this is something had happened to you or the kid instead of your grandma? I doubt it, (or at least I hope he would not argue with you over this if you or his child were the ones in direct danger). He says he couldn't have done anything to help you anyways, being as he was in another state. But this isn't true, there *is* something he could have done, and that was to call you and talk to you and provide verbal comfort in a stressful and sad time for you, drunk or not. And this was something that as your supportive partner, he failed to do. Yes, he was really looking forward to this party, but shit happens and life gets in the way. With an emergency as dire as this, his family take priority here, or at least it should anyways. I get he was having fun with his college friends, it isn't surprising that alcohol would be involved in this get together. Not saying he can't drink or ever get drunk again in his lifetime, but being far away from your family in another state is not the best time to do it. He is an adult, and there are consequences for his actions in choosing to get blasted drunk that night, and he should at the very least, apologize that he wasn't there for you when you needed him (and apologize for getting angry with you that you were upset about this in the first place!)", "The very least your husband could\u2019ve done was check in to see how you were holding up and how your grandma was doing.

My guess is that the phone was just turned off so that you didn\u2019t ruin his night which turns my stomach. All he really showed is that he can\u2019t be counted on when the chips are down.

The callous texts from his friend's phone push this from simply being irresponsible to being outright insensitive. If they were going to text you, the first thing should have been to ask how you and your grandmother were doing, not a drunk selfie. The fact that he didn't even check in the next morning really seals the deal though. I rarely visit this sub but I just stumbled across this one and it really struck a chord with me.

My ex didn\u2019t call us all weekend and when I tried to call him, the phone was off. He blamed patchy mobile signal but he was in freakin Melbourne!! Doubt.\n\nHe returned home on Sunday night and was angry at me for being upset that he didn\u2019t call and check how our son was. Our son barely slept all weekend and was in a lot of pain.

As every relationship communicates differently. My husband and I are not a believer of chasing information for updates. We are of a couple that updates each other of current matters. I hate turning into a nagging wife and my husband has a job where he\u2019s in meetings non stop and is difficult to get ahold of. \n\nSo for me I don\u2019t see the need for your husband to followup and ask you when is the surgery? Is she out of surgery? What\u2019s the status update? As it\u2019s your grandmother I would think as soon as you have news you would update him. If it was his grandmother I would expect him doing the same to update you. \n\nIf it weren\u2019t for the emergency, would you not want him to send an update of him having a great time with his buddies? Would you not want him to get wasted? \n\nIn the end, I think you can communicate \u201cI really needed emotional support. I really couldn\u2019t share in your joy of fun. The next time you are away (regardless of the occasion), even if there\u2019s no emergency I expect you have always have your phone charged. Your immediate family (wife and daughter) may need to contact you. \n\nI think also given that your husband was away on a boys night \u2026 he\u2019s not the ideal person to lean on. I wouldn\u2019t want to stop my husband from having fun, since I bet it\u2019s been a really long time since he saw these guys, but I wouldn\u2019t want to have any conversation with a drunk guy besides the \u201cglad you\u2019re having fun, stay safe and don\u2019t do something stupid.\u201d \n\nI would have reached to someone else for emotional support.", "NTA\n\nSo much is wrong with what happened.

Even at my drunkest, I would know this isn't appropriate behaviour from my partner.\n\nHell, when I was already out drinking with friends one night, my friend let me know about a stressful family situation. I sent her a message with my love, asking if there was anything I could do (probably a hollow request given I couldn't get to her and there wasn't much she could do, but just to let her know somebody was there), and then checked in with her later to see if there had been any changes.

All I ask is for him to have his phone available and if that can\u2019t happen, check-in with me from another phone.

Surely texting you a few times or letting you know \"hey, my phone is dying\" wouldn't have ruined his infamous reunion with his friends.\n\nOn Easter Day, my bf's grandma was feeling pretty bad, and they had to call an ambulance in the end. I was with my family at home, but after seeing his messages, I had my phone next to me all the time, to check up on him or in case he updated me on his grandma's conditions. I did this voluntarily because I wanted to support him and be there for him, and it certainly didn't ruin my day.

He would have been no help even for emotional support during this time. Who knows - you might have gotten another drunk pic SMH.

One time was a virus, and the other time I got food poisoning. The first time I was crying about how terrible I felt after not sleeping the whole night, and all he angrily said was \"what do you want me to do, get some water?\" A hug and some emotional support was all I wanted. When I said that through my tears, he went out to get water.\n\nThe other vacation with the other ex was even worse. I got a virus, and he didn't even wanna go outside alone the next day so I could get some sleep in our tiny hotel room. He constantly kept me from being able to sleep (I needed that rest so freaking bad, after a night of constantly double spewing my body was so weak and tired) and had the audacity to get pissed at me that he couldn't do anything that day. I begged him go to the beach alone or take a walk through the beautiful city we were in. But he couldn't cause he \"didn't know what to do by himself.\" So he kept moping and keeping me from getting better faster. My needs didn't matter. He felt more upset about his inconvenience than me being sick.\n\nBoth had the emotional maturity of a toddler. Not one emotional supportive bone in their bodies. When your partner shows you how they react in stressful or shitty situations, take notice.", "All I can imagine: What if she and her baby had an accident or something had happened? I'd always make damn sure my phone is either fully charged or I have a powerbank with me and keep my phone on vibration or on loud at least! All she wanted was emotional support from him and he didn't even give that. If my partner ever texted me only \"are you there, I really need you\" I'd jump to grab my phone! I can't imagine ignoring my partner if they told me someone dear to them might be in the ER and possibly dying.\n\nOP is NTA for sure.", "Had to look that SDE up- haha. I personally call it \"vjing\"  as in verbal jacking off (vjer- noun, vjing- verb). A man standing in front of an audience or attendees in a meeting and talking on and on and on while the audience or attendees completely zone out. The only one getting anything out of the man's talk is him getting off on the sound of his own voice. Also a gathering of men who are trying to \"one up\" each other about their job, their life, car..... Getting drunk with the guys is the physical act of vjing- such as the husband's reunion seemed to have gotten in a short amount of time.", "An adult and good partner would have restricted drinking knowing that they needed to be emotionally available for their partner. He isn\u2019t technically a child so he doesn\u2019t need to be told what to do.", "I wouldn't do what the husband did to even a marginally close friend of mine, let alone a spouse.

OP\u2019s husband is the type of guy who complains about \u201chaving to babysit\u201d when he\u2019s stuck watching his own kid.

Of course, maybe the husband knows OP's phone number by heart and was able to give it to friend (and let's be honest, even if people nowadays don't know a lot of numbers by heart, I think a spouse's number will likely be an exception), but even then, why tf send a drunk selfie instead of \"hey, my phone died, you can reach me via buddy's phone\"?", "yeah exactly. even if there wasnt the option to charge it, his friend obviously had his phone, it was charged and the husband knew had the number. hes TA even if there wasnt an emergency, because what if something happened to his kid and op couldnt contact him? i mean what else does he even have a phone for if his own wife cannot reach him?", "That's fair. I thought you might very missed it on my wall of text. LOL!", "  \nBased on the information you provided, it does not seem like you are the asshole (TA) for being upset with your husband. Your concerns and frustrations are valid, considering the circumstances.  \nIt is understandable that your husband wanted to attend his college reunion and see his friends after a long time, but it is also important for him to prioritize his responsibilities as a husband and a father. When you informed him about the emergency involving your grandmother, it would have been appropriate for him to show more concern and keep you updated about his availability. Letting his phone die and not making any effort to communicate with you while you were dealing with a family emergency can be seen as irresponsible and inconsiderate.  \nWhile it may not have been possible for him to physically do something from another state, emotional support and regular communication during such a difficult time would have been helpful. Your request for him to be available and check on you was reasonable.", "NTA\n\nAnd I would reconsider your relationship if he thinks providing emotional support during a family emergency is \u201ccatering\u201d to you? Because he is supposed to do that! What in the world?? Why wouldn\u2019t he want to cater to your needs? Is he not supposed to be the one you turn to during difficult times??? I think that\u2019s even in most wedding vows. \nWho cares if he could have done something for your grandma or not. All he had to do was tell you he\u2019d be there for you. It ain\u2019t that hard.

He\u2019s a husband and father before a friend or partygoer. I don\u2019t know if this is the first incident, but from this alone it really seems like he\u2019s a selfish person who cares more about getting drunk and having fun than whether or not his wife is doing okay. It\u2019s not true that he couldn\u2019t have done anything from a different state. He could have offered emotional support, which it seems is what you truly needed. He also could have not gone to the party and went straight home, but clearly that\u2019s too big of a sacrifice and the thought probably never even crossed his mind.\n\nPoint is he showed his true colors and priorities. That he\u2019s not someone you can trust or go to during a difficult time. That he values himself and fun over anyone else. I\u2019d still try to talk to him once you\u2019ve both cooled down a little just because it\u2019s worth a try.

I hope you two can recover from this.", "NTA. \nI hope your grandmother heals and feel better soon. That\u2019s hard. \n\nMy dad is in the hospital right now.

What if it was the BABY that got sick??  Would he have done the same?\nThe BARE MINIMUM he should have done was keep his phone in working order to receive any and all information you needed to give him.

OP\u2019s husband is a huge asshole wow.", "I wasn't sure which way I agreed with until this comment. Now I agree with NTA.

What this means we can only speculate.\n\nBut definitely he should have made sure to keep tabs on the situation and support her during a scary time.
