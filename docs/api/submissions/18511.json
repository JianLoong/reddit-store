All is fine and well until yesterday right before he was leaving for the party that was at a bar and I got an unexpected call from my parents who also live out of state. I am a nurse so they were asking what they should do with my grandma who called them stating that she couldn't feel her foot and that she was in excruciating pain. I told them to take her to the ER immediately and they said she couldn't walk so I told them to call an ambulance. I called my husband right after and the last update that I gave him before his party was that they were transferring her to another hospital for emergency surgery for a life threatening condition. I was waiting anxiously at home when the surgery was taking way longer than expected (>3 hours). My husband hadn't checked in at all. I got a text from a number that I didn't know that was a drunk selfie of some guy and my husband, with zero context. I texted my husband and said that I was worried sick about my grandma and didn't appreciate getting texted drunk selfies from random people. Heard nothing. After an hour I texted the random number and asked if my husband's phone had died and he said \"Yes \ud83d\ude02\".\n\nHere's where I may be TA, I texted back \"Cool, my grandma is still in emergency surgery \ud83d\ude02\". I never got a reply to this. About 4 hours later when my grandma survived and was transferred to the ICU I texted my husband how much he had let me down. This turned into a fight where he believes that he he did no wrong because \"I knew he was looking forward to this party for two months and he couldn't do anything anyway\". I blew up and told him how irresponsible it was for him to get drunk and let his phone die while I was alone with our baby during a family emergency. He apologized for not \"checking in more\" to which I corrected that he didn't check in at all (not even the next morning) and he says that he \"Did his due diligence in making himself reachable\" and I said that a random number texting me a drunk selfie does not count as him telling me that his phone was dead and that's how I should reach him. He said the name of the bar in passing a few times but I couldn't remember the name and I did not know the name of his hotel.  He says I'm just overreacting and it's not a big deal because \"it's not like he could do anything from another state\" and that he did no wrong, seeing his friends was important to him and a lot of them he hasn't seen in 15 years and that he shouldn't have to disrupt his plans to \"cater to me\". I didn't ask him to take the next flight home just be available or communicate that he wasn't. I told him that I was afraid and he could have at least checked to see if I was okay and that it also isn't okay to let your phone die when someone else has your child even without an emergency. So, AITA for flipping out on him?\n\nETA that the emergency happened right before the party so he was sober at that time and aware that the situation was touch and go. I called him immediately after I had my parents call 911.", "created_utc": 1685405984, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13vb50g/aita_for_flipping_out_on_my_husband_via_text/", "score": 357, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Obviously I couldn\u2019t go anymore but he did. \n\n3 hours later, when I was off work, I got a call from my mom who was rushing my dad to the ER for heart issues (he had a double by pass about a year ago and the signs were a possible heart attack) \n\nI was so panicked. This is my dad. Even though my dad is older, and not in the best health, the thought of losing him I can\u2019t handle. Of course I know one day, I will. It\u2019s how life works. \n\nAnyway. In my state I was so tunnel vision. I called my husband over and over and over. Like, if he was here this wouldn\u2019t be happening type thinking. Which is so absurd. \n\nTo me, it didn\u2019t matter he was on a boat, around water and didn\u2019t have his phone in his hand. I was angry. At him. \n\nIt was so silly of me. \n\nI knew where he was. What he was doing. Looking back, I can see I reacted so badly towards my husband. No one can predict an emergency, so he wasn\u2019t spending his time like one would happen. \n\nI was scared and afraid for my dad, and that turned into anger towards my husband. \n\nIt\u2019s normal to feel out of control when something like this happens. It was your grandmother, she was far away. You couldn\u2019t do anything but wait. \nAs a nurse, I\u2019m sure you wanted to do more for her. \n\nI was an asshole for how I treated my husband and I think YTA for how you treated yours.", "YTA\n\nInstead of **calling** the random number when they confirmed that 1) they were with your husband and 2) yes, his phone was dead, you decided to send a sarcastic, passive-aggressive text?\n\nYou had the means to get ahold of your husband right then and there.  Call that number, ask them to pass the phone to your husband.\n\nOtherwise, like others pointed out, you had other sources of support.  I will never understand the mentality that partners need to be reachable 24/7.  \u201cWhat if an emergency comes up?\u201d - You are an adult.  Do what you would do if they weren\u2019t there (which is exactly what you did anyway).\n\nIf it really is so important to you that you always have a way of contacting your husband, then why *didn\u2019t* you know the name of his hotel?  Of the bar?  Why did this only come up after the fact, and why is it **his** fault that you didn\u2019t know it?  You\u2019re an adult who can ask for this info at any time.", "YTA - sorry, but I never get this outlook. What exactly did your husband need to do here? If you needed him home, you should have told him. Otherwise why does he have to ruin his night.", "I keep flipping between ESH and NAH. It does suck that you couldn't reach him, but I can't imagine you failed to understand what would happen if he went to a meetup out of state? He should've been available, but at the same time should he REALLY be on call? If you feel that way, why did you okay it in the first place?", "You are mis-directing your anger.", "I want to connect with a no judgment here thought. \n\nMy grandma was a tent pole in my life and did everything she could for her grandkids. When the health scares started, I had a lot of panic. I had moved to the east coast and my family and grandma were in Arizona. Time and time again, I had to make the active decision between traveling home during COVID or trusting in the resources and health services in Arizona. \n\nFrom the initial issues to her passing, it covered about 18 months. The health care system handled the immediate (like they did with your grandma), and it all turned out okay. There was a point where I knew it wasn\u2019t going to get better and my husband and I spent a month in Arizona while she was in hospice and until she was finally able to rest in her home for the last time. \n\nThe timeline was staggering. Everytime, it brought panic to me, but not every time warranted a visceral reaction or trip out there. \n\nYou are clearly upset because you needed someone to talk to that you loved and trusted, and I\u2019m sorry that he wasn\u2019t there for you because of his trip. I hope you can rest easier knowing that she is okay right now. \n\nFrom the title, he did reach out in his own way, but could have done more. I\u2019m not going to make excuses for him, but in the morning, could he have still be sleeping from a long night out or didn\u2019t plug in his phone?\n\n[An Edit] With how fast phones charge now with their bricks, he could have easily have been like \u201chey guys, give me 15 minutes or I\u2019ll meet you at the bar\u201d and had enough to carry him through. He made bad decisions towards his availability.", "YTA, what were you going to do a state away from Grandma?  What was your husband supposed to do?  It sounds like you weren't comfortable with him going and used this as an excuse to be pissed.  Of course, he was having fun. It's a reunion.  Did you have a contingency plan for incase, like IL or friends?  I think you are hard on this one.", "ESH, but with a balance towards YTA.\n\nHe should\u2019ve told you his phone was dying, but a) you had other avenues of emotional support - call your parents. B) you supported him going interstate for the purposes of a college reunion (aka getting drunk) and that does actually entail taking responsibility of being alone and self sufficient, physically, mentally and emotionally.", "Sounds like you were not happy that he went to this reunion and you were going to do anything you could to interrupt him.  \n\nThere was nothing he could do but you being a nurse would know that.", "YTA\n\nIt\u2019s coming off like you were unhappy he went away for the weekend. All the other stuff is padding your reason for your original concern of your grandmother. She was better within a few hours, but you have managed to make this an actual problem for your marriage.", "YTA. You\u2019re blaming him for your grandmother being sick. You knew where he was, you could have found him if you wanted to.", "Idk why you\u2019re getting so many downvotes.  \n\nWhile i can see that he couldn\u2019t have done anything from another state, i can also see that it would have been nice of him to have let you know that his phone was dead and you can text his friend if you need him. Also to not hear from him the next morning is upsetting. Is it correct that he didn\u2019t know if your grandma was ok or not before he went to bed? That is all not really ok imo. \n\nNTA is my final verdict. Your partner should care about you enough to check in, despite not being able to do anything for you. Sometimes \u201cdoing something\u201d isn\u2019t what\u2019s needed, but instead being supportive.", "What exactly was your husband supposed to do? Your grandma\u2019s being sick wasn\u2019t his fault and there was nothing he could\u2019ve done. \n\nAs the person who was at home you\u2019re the one whose phone line was crucial. You need to be able to call emergency services for you or your child. Your husband who was on holiday was in no situation to help you out either at home or with your grandmother.\n\nYTA", "YTA. Him knowing about your grandma and the situation would not have helped you in the least. The timing of it was unfortunate. It would have been *preferable* to have your husband\u2019s support in the moment. But he was reasonably unavailable and that is not a failure on his part.", "You guys are heartless, individualistic assholes. \nThey are a family, he is a partner and a father first, the least he should have done is check in as soon as he knew what was happening and apologize for missing communication earlier. This is the minimum expectation for an adult partner with a small child at home.\n\nNTA wishing your grandma a speedy recovery. I can only imagine how alone and scared you must've felt and then the disrespectful drunk selfie on top of that. Your husband should be feeling mortified and needs to properly apologize and show support.", "I don't understand all the \" y t a\" my boyfriend just had a life threatening family emergency were in the same state but it was more than hour away from me to help him, but I had my phone on me all day, I charged my smart watch to make sure if he called or needed to reach me I would be there. When scary things happen you want to know the person you love is willing to drop everything and be there even if not physically, that's why u choose them to be your partner through thick and thin. And he dropped the ball. NTA.", "So confused about all the Y T A votes. If I was in her partners shoes, I would have checked in more with her. And while yes, there is nothing he could have done from that far away, he still could have provided emotional support which she clearly needed. Also, like why send a drunk selfie, seriously? Like she needed to see that when she\u2019s stressing out about an emergency with her loved one? NTA. \n\nGlad your grandma is doing okay.", "NTA - its not like you were asking him to drop everything and come home, you just wanted him to be contactable and to see if you're ok due to your family emergency.  Also, what if it was your baby that had the emergency, your husband should've made sure his phone was fully charged while away from home when you have small children.", "INFO: what about your husband being drunk made his phone die? What could he have done to prevent his phone from dying once he was already out and the surgery went longer than expected?\n\nOverall, seems like YTA. Soft, because you were upset about a family emergency, but it\u2019s not like there was a lot he could do.\n\nEither you needed him to come home, and you should have said so, or you didn\u2019t need him and shouldn\u2019t grief him about enjoying his night out.", "NTA\n\nI'm concerned about the number of Y T A on this post. It's almost as if they don't have real partners, have never had an emergency, or didn't actually read your post? I don't know. But it's really the bare minimum to ask your partner, the person who is supposed to care for you more than anyone else in your life, to at least have their phone on during an emergency. \n\n>he didn't check in at all (not even the next morning)\n\nLike this. My partner would be concerned and would definitely have checked in on me and asked for updates. I probably would have first had to convince them not to immediately start driving home. There was a grave chance that your grandmother was going to pass away. Your partner should want to be there for you if this were to happen. Even if he didn't want to/couldn't drive home, asking him to be available on the phone is the bare minimum. \n\n>disrupt his plans to \"cater to me\".\n\nThis was really shitty. I would really start to reflect on my relationship if my partner thought that supporting me when a close family member was in danger of passing away was \"catering\". Like wtf. \n\nMy partner is my best friend. If someone I cared about passed away, I would want to talk to him first and instinctively. And he *wants* to be the one I call and wants to be the one to support me and vice versa.\n\nETA: typo", "NTA .. your husband acting like he doesn\u2019t give a fuck is the A H here \n\nWhile it\u2019s true there\u2019s nothing he could tangibly do, he could show a minuscule amount of concern for your feelings", "ESH. He definitely should have let you know his phone was dying, and checked in with you the next morning. But you also should have taken down the name of the hotel if you were so concerned about being able to reach him. And you didn't need to try to guilt him while he was out having fun, when there was nothing he could have actually done.", "NTA. A supportive partner is someone who checks in regularly during a stressful and scary situation like this. Also, there was the real chance your family would need to be with your grandmother. I honestly can't imagine being able to get hammered and have a great time with old friends when I know my wife is home worried with our 1 year old. To get a drunk selfie is incredibly disrespectful.", "YTA.  What, exactly, we\u2019re you wanting your husband to do?  Sit by the hotel phone waiting for you to call incase granny kicked it?   There is nothing he or you could have done in this situation except sit around and wait.  You had a way to contact him.", "YTA- there was nothing you could do. And even less that he could do.", "YTA - Basically, if he has to be on a tether to you 24/7/365, no personal life at all (this was a planned event for two plus months) then something is seriously wrong  with this relationship.", "NTA- been in a similar situation. The first person I called was my husband. I needed comfort, reassurance and just to be heard. I am sorry you did not have that experience. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s to much to ask him to step out of party mode to shoot you a text to check in after learning about your grandma. When you have a family you don\u2019t get to check out to suit your needs. Same with parenting. Sheesh.", "YTA. Annoyed yes, fighting over it, no.", "NTA since he was sober when he first heard about the situation. Getting drunk with buddies v. supporting your partner in a family emergency?  He's old enough to know better, and he could have used his friend's phone to check in on you, and nobody needs to get incoherent drunk at his age.  What a jerk.", "NTA. You needed your partner for emotional support, and he was not there for you. Not saying he couldn\u2019t go to his party, but he should have checked in with you.", "YTA", "No one\u2019s TA. Could you have written down the hotel and bar? Yea. Could he have checked in on you and charged his phone? definitely. Emotions are high when navigating the first year of a baby\u2019s life. Give yourself and him a little compassion, and recognize what could improve in future chaotic events.", "I was so ready to call you the a hole until your husband opened his mouth \ud83d\ude02. It\u2019s not really his fault his phone died during the emergency. As you said he found out right before he was leaving and by then it was to late to make sure it was charged. Although traveling he should be making sure it\u2019s charged anyway. You get the NTA vote because you didn\u2019t blow up on him about the phone. You blew up on him about his action afterwards and his response to you.", "NTA. I get that it was his reunion but he is supposed to be your partner and support you. I don\u2019t think a text every couple of hours would\u2019ve killed his party. It\u2019s also super irresponsible to have his phone die, what if something happens to him? I\u2019d be pissed off at my husband too, worried about him. Though you should probably know the hotel name\u2026", "NTA\nWhat if something had happened to your baby?\nIt doesn\u2019t matter that he can\u2019t do anything from where he is, he could\u2019ve contacted you or checked in on you \nI guess next time an emergency happens dont even let him know because apparently it doesn\u2019t matter", "NTA. I understand there is nothing he could do, but you were obviously in distress. At the very least he should\u2019ve checked in with you before bed and the next morning. I do think the fight is blown a bit out of proportion, but I definitely understand the frustration", "NTA but there are a lot of asshole commenters. anyone saying grandparents aren\u2019t immediate family on this thread must come from some perfect nuclear family situation or their GPs were long dead and they never knew them or had a relationship with them. not everyone\u2019s family looks the same, and some people were raised by their grandparents. so using that in an argument about this is just disrespectful to OP and any other person who has a close relationship with their grandparent(s).", "YTA. The term \"family emergency\" is a little misleading. It stopped being an emergency when your grandmother was admitted to the hospital and transferred into the care of appropriate medical professionals.\n\nWhy did you feel the need to provide active updates to your husband? Why does he need to know if the surgery is taking longer than usual or if she's being transferred to another hospital? What was your husband supposed to do with that information? He was literally in another state.\n\nYou're angry because he got drunk at a college reunion when you have a baby at home and a family emergency? Did you two have a baby when you decided you were okay with him going to this reunion? And if so, did you establish boundaries that he wouldn't get drunk? Why would he stay completely sober once you told him your grandma was in the hospital? What would he be able to do?\n\nYou need to get your FOMO in check. You were clearly under a lot of stress with your grandma in the hospital, and you resented your husband because he was off having fun\u2014like you two had planned. So you text him pointless updates and get mad when he has spotty responses, and then create this whole straw man where he looks irresponsible for drinking during a \"family emergency\" (in quotes because it's not really an emergency), and because \"you're alone at home with the baby.\" You don't like getting drunk texts from random numbers while gma is in the hospital? Well, he probably doesn't like you trying to ruin his night from afar by pretending there's something he should be doing to help the situation.\n\nIf you didn't want to be home alone with the baby while your husband goes to another state to drink, then you should have thought about that before you said you were okay with him going. Your husband has done nothing wrong", "YTA- Your husband is in a different state, and your parents and granda are also.... in a different state. You and him couldn't do anything to help. Having your husband at your beckond call while you knew he was drunk and out with friends was a way to manipulate. \n\nI understand you were worried, but if you needed comfort and information, then you should have been talking to your parents. \n\nThe most your husband could have done was say, \"How's it going? Are you okay?\" And I do NOT believe that would have satisfied you and made you happy. If it really was as simple as wanting that type of text from him then you are massively blowing this up", "NTA; your husband knew that your grandmother was in crisis and that you were worried about her BEFORE he got drunk, and he didn't set up any backup ways for you to reach him for support, he didn't bother to check in with you at all even the next morning when he was sober and apart from his friends... It must have been so wildly painful to receive a drunk selfie from a stranger's phone number with a laughing-crying emoji when you were reaching out for any kind of support from your partner. Like you said, you just asked for him to be available OR communicate that he wasn't, and it's not a crazy ask to want the father of your one-year-old to be available by phone in the midst of an emergency anyway.\n\n I'm sorry you went through that, and I hope your grandmother is recovering.", "NTA, it\u2019s messed up that everyone seems to be focussing on how grandma didn\u2019t die, it\u2019s not his problem, and he couldn\u2019t have done anything anyway. The main issue is being available during emergencies, what if it was about his own baby? And don\u2019t say \u2018well, it wasn\u2019t\u2019 because that really does not justify being unable to be contacted at all. A random drunk selfie notwithstanding, I sincerely do not believe that he couldn\u2019t have found a way to recharge his phone if he wanted to. And anyone who is blaming OP about not asking where he\u2019s going or where he\u2019s staying, this is not on her only. Her husband could\u2019ve told her himself as well so putting blame on her is just the sexist way of putting everything on the women in relationships.", "NTA. You didn\u2019t need to flip out, but you have every right to be upset that he irresponsibly let his phone die and didn\u2019t check in. Cater to you? You\u2019re his wife and there with his child. You should be his priority. No he couldn\u2019t have done anything, and it wasn\u2019t an emergency with you or your child, but he could have at least responded in a timely manner once to let you know he was sorry she was in surgery and to keep him updated. Did he need to keep texting every five minutes? No and nobody is saying that", "YTA. He wasn\u2019t unreachable, and there was nothing he could\u2019ve done anyway. You want to keep insisting he was rude, disrespectful and unsupportive. Sounds like deeper issues than a dead phone at a reunion.", "Idk about other couples but my husband and I have a levels of emergency things. You nor your child were dying, nor were either of your parents. There\u2019s nothing he could have done and providing updates would suffice. \n\nYTA. He was on a trip out of town. It wasn\u2019t an emergency that necessitated him return immediately and you could provide the necessary updates via text.", "NTA. Your husband didn't need to come home or really make any changes to his plans other than show some courtesy. Checking in and offering words of comfort is not too much to expect. It's actually the bare minimum.", "YTA. \n\nThere's absolutely nothing your husband could do in this situation. I always suggest letting the Dr's at the hospital do their jobs, instead of worrying about someones dead cell phone. You are a pita.", "YTA. In all honesty you\u2019re probably misplacing your fear over something you had no control over (your grandma) into anger towards your husband because you had to deal with the mess but he was out having fun. He wasn\u2019t totally unreachable. You could\u2019ve called the number and explained the situation. But like everyone else was saying there is nothing else you or your husband could\u2019ve done other than to wait for news. You owe him an apology imo", "YTA", "YTA, you need other people in your life that can offer emotional support. Sure your hubby can be the main strength you turn to, but he can\u2019t always be there. You need girlfriends, family, whatever. This includes if the baby is sick or something, which you keep throwing in like it\u2019s *the absolute worst* ohmygod what if the baby was sick and you couldn\u2019t reach him?? Guess what, shizz like that happens in life. Get a stronger circle of mommy friends and family so you can cope when hubby is away or busy or working.", "YTA", "NTA. There was nothing he could do to help with the situation with your grandmother, but he has a spouse and a *baby,* and needed to be reachable in case there was an emergency with you or your child...and honestly, I just went to my ten-year reunion, and I can't imagine wanting to go out and party all night and let my phone die if I knew my partner was home waiting to hear whether her grandmother was going to make it, especially if we also had a baby that she was caring for alone! You didn't ask him to come home or not have fun. He was insensitive, didn't seem to support you at all, and was irresponsible and should have given you a CLEAR way to reach him. Apart from the lack of support for you, he's not 21 and carefree anymore, he has a baby, and he should be reachable.", "NTA, husband is TA", "So was he going to the grandma state and preform surgery himself? He a doctor?. You didn't want him to go. You are manipulating this situation to never let him have a break... Do you even care about grandma?. People still need to be individuals even when their married.", "YTA, it wasn't a family emergency.  You and your son are fine and so were both sets of parents. Grandparents are extended family, he couldn't do anything anyways. If something happened to you or your child or the inlaws or parents that would be a different story.", "YTA", "Wait - he hadn't bothered to tell you what hotel he was staying in??? In addition to letting his phone die?\n\nHonestly, that sounds to me like he decided he was \"off the leash\" on this trip and that he was essentially going to act like he had no real life responsibilities. It would have been nice for him to be there to give you emotional support and to be available for brainstorming in case the emergency escalated but the thing that's getting me is \\*he didn't tell you where he was\\*.\n\nAny time I go on a trip, I make sure my family knows where I'm going (in email, not verbal) and how to contact me if they can't reach my phone. It's just the adult, considerate thing to do.\n\nEdit: NTA", "YTA what could've he done if the phone didn't die? Is he a doctor? Is he close enough to physically check in on her? No you're being ridiculous", "YTA.", "YTA I understand that you were scared, but he\u2019s right he would not have been able to anything and I think he had a right to enjoy the moment!!", "nta, i understand why you'd be upset that you can't reach your partner in an emergency where your feelings are running high. but at the same time, your husband probably didn't purposefully let his phone die.", "Let's see. Family emergency that ou couldn't even get to, because its out of state...and you're mad because he was out for something thats been long planned, and he wouldnt have been able to help with either...and a battery died so you couldn't...play by play the emergency that you weren't there for either.\n\nAnd you got a drunk selfie from an unknown number and threw a hissy fit about it?\n\nYta", "NTA Forget your grandma for a minute.

Read [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq#wiki_post_deletion) before [contacting the mod team](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAmItheAsshole)***\n\nSo I (34F) and my husband (35M) had a plan this weekend that he would be the next state over for a college reunion while I stayed home with our 1 year old baby. All is fine and well until yesterday right before he was leaving for the party that was at a bar and I got an unexpected call from my parents who also live out of state. I am a nurse so they were asking what they should do with my grandma who called them stating that she couldn't feel her foot and that she was in excruciating pain. I told them to take her to the ER immediately and they said she couldn't walk so I told them to call an ambulance. I called my husband right after and the last update that I gave him before his party was that they were transferring her to another hospital for emergency surgery for a life threatening condition. I was waiting anxiously at home when the surgery was taking way longer than expected (>3 hours). My husband hadn't checked in at all. I got a text from a number that I didn't know that was a drunk selfie of some guy and my husband, with zero context. I texted my husband and said that I was worried sick about my grandma and didn't appreciate getting texted drunk selfies from random people. Heard nothing. After an hour I texted the random number and asked if my husband's phone had died and he said \"Yes \ud83d\ude02\".\n\nHere's where I may be TA, I texted back \"Cool, my grandma is still in emergency surgery \ud83d\ude02\". I never got a reply to this. About 4 hours later when my grandma survived and was transferred to the ICU I texted my husband how much he had let me down. This turned into a fight where he believes that he he did no wrong because \"I knew he was looking forward to this party for two months and he couldn't do anything anyway\". I blew up and told him how irresponsible it was for him to get drunk and let his phone die while I was alone with our baby during a family emergency. He apologized for not \"checking in more\" to which I corrected that he didn't check in at all (not even the next morning) and he says that he \"Did his due diligence in making himself reachable\" and I said that a random number texting me a drunk selfie does not count as him telling me that his phone was dead and that's how I should reach him. He said the name of the bar in passing a few times but I couldn't remember the name and I did not know the name of his hotel.  He says I'm just overreacting and it's not a big deal because \"it's not like he could do anything from another state\" and that he did no wrong, seeing his friends was important to him and a lot of them he hasn't seen in 15 years and that he shouldn't have to disrupt his plans to \"cater to me\". I didn't ask him to take the next flight home just be available or communicate that he wasn't. I told him that I was afraid and he could have at least checked to see if I was okay and that it also isn't okay to let your phone die when someone else has your child even without an emergency. So, AITA for flipping out on him?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "So reading the opening I thought it was going to be something happened to you or your child and you couldn\u2019t get a hold of him when he was needed. In this situation, I\u2019m not sure what you needed from him or how he could\u2019ve helped?", "NAH. Was your husband insensitive to your emotions at the time when he sent that picture? Yes. Are you upset and maybe misplacing your feelings into anger towards your husband? Yes. \n\nI think both of you probably mishandled the situation. It would have been best if he had sent a text like, \u201chey my phone died here\u2019s this buddies number\u201d but he was drunk, and not being sensitive. And I\u2019m sure you\u2019re feeling unsupported because of this so you were snarky. \n\nI\u2019d say NAH, but definitely one of the situations where you hurt your spouse unintentionally and both of you should apologize to each other.", "I dk maybe NAH? I get why you would want emotional support given that you were scared for your grandma and that him sending you drunk selfies is annoying. I think he should\u2019ve gone out and made a point to check in every couple hours with sincerity/concern and not drunk antics. However, you also seem to have overreacted. \n\nKnowing he was going to be drunk, I probably would\u2019ve looked to others for the support you were looking for \u2014 like the rest of your family. He\u2019s right that besides consoling you, which is going to be minimal anyway while he\u2019s so far away, there isn\u2019t much he can do. I think you both could stand to cut each other some slack honestly.", "No judgement but, when I have bad news I tend to wait for a face to face when passing it on. I wouldn\u2019t want to stress someone who is out of town and on a fun trip when I know all they can do is stress over it.\n\nYou were stressing. You also were able to get updates regularly. You could talk to your mom and dad while they also waited and stressed.\n\nThe friends phone confirmed your hubby\u2019s phone wasn\u2019t charged. You paid for the event and knew he was at the event. \n\nYou could have left a message on his phone for him to call you once his phone was recharged and then left it at that.\n\nSitting and stressing was all that was going on. I know and have been through it with my mom. \n\nSurgery, you sit and stress. You wait. Your nervous. \n\nBut I don\u2019t think you should have texted that unknown phone about anything regarding your grandma. You asked about hubby\u2019s phone and they answered.\n\nI hope you apologize to the phone owner. Tell them you weee stressed and not thinking.\n\nApologize to your hubby for being short. He should be understanding. \n\nThis can all be resolved peacefully!\n\nI\u2019m glad your grandma is doing better and that the surgery went well. Concentrate on the positive.", "NTA", "Gently, yta. I get that you were scared and wanted him to be there for you. But the fact is he was drunk in another state and there was no comfort he could have offered from his party, drunk off his ass.

Ya know, like a grown-up.

Just to let my sweetheart know I love them. Ridiculous not to make any contact.", "I am sorry OP but here, YTA.  Nobody controls when a family emergency is gonna occur.  Just chill out and handle what you can.  I know it's hard, from a mom who's been there, but like.... You gotta let him have breathing room.  ESPECIALLY if you want the same breathing room in the future.  Men & women are so different.  Not only communication styles, but friendships, family relations, etc.  Just let it go and try to set more clear expectations in the future.  Are you REALLY even mad at him?  Or are you flustered at the whole grandma situation and expect him to drop everything to comfort you?  But him a portable phone charger for his birthday if you like but let this one go, as long as he is otherwise decent, kind and responsible.", "Fucking hell OP, learn to communicate like an adult. If you wanted your husband to come home, that should have been articulated. You had a line of communication to him via a buddy of his so all you had to do was call that number and ask to speak to your husband. Your husband isn't wrong in saying there was nothing he could do about your grandmothers condition.\n\nYTA", "YTA.  If you really needed him, call or text the number you already think is him and say \"there's an emergency, I to speak to <husband's name> and then tell him \"I need you home.\"  You also apparently had the ability to tell him you needed him home and not to go. You did not, nor did you try to notify him that things changed for you after you let him go.

I don\u2019t care if I get downvoted. It\u2019s not a problem of the phone dying. It\u2019s the texts. They\u2019re just gross in this situation. Partners should be the first support not last. He can have his fun and still be cognizant of your emotions. I cannot imagine acting like that if my grandmother in law (either of them) was in surgery. \n\nMy fianc\u00e9 knows first hand how terrifying it is to suddenly not have contact with me. He knew I was sick I\u2019d passed out and stopped texting while he was at a Christmas party. He had his fun there then pushed to get home as fast as he could. An hour later i had been in a coma.

I think you're justified in feeling upset in what you're going through and like you felt let down by your husband. But I think your husband is justified in saying he couldn't have done much, needed this release, and feels like what he did was sufficient given his distance, your previous plans, and what info you were able to give him at the tome. What would make either of you assholes is if you don't have a conversation, like adults, about how you might prefer things to go differently should this happen again. \n\nAnd I get that you're going through a lot but you'd be TA if you didn't acknowledge that you're actually directing the feelings of anxiety and fear about your grandma at your husband and how out of control you felt in that moment.", "I don't think you're an asshole. This is your husband, not just some random friend. Your grandmother was in a position she could have died, your husband should of at least had the decency to charge his phone. My husband is a respiratory therapist and stepped away from the floor to talk to me on the phone after my grandmother passed away just to make sure i was okay. He is supposed to be your support person. He didn't have to leave the party but he could have shown you some consideration. No party is more important than leaving your spouse alone and scared for.", "NTA. I don't think that expecting your husband to be reachable and sober enough *not to send you a drunken selfie while you are at the hospital waiting for surgery to be over* is outlandish\n\nReading the comments made me think I might have misread the original post. Nope. So then I go back to the comments. Am I losing my mind here?\n\nSince when is \"person having a good time with friends\" more important than \"family member undergoing lifesaving surgery\" ??\n\nShe didn't even ask him to stay. Only that he stay reachable, and possibly send a couple of texts asking \"how are things? Oh, still waiting? Hang in there. It will work out. Love you. Keep me posted\"\n\nI would have been so pissed your texts seem tame to me. I guess that makes me an AH according to everyone here. \n\nI can live with that. At least I'm not the kind of person that can completely forget their spouse's fear and sadness and go party their ass off.", "Nta. You needed his emotional support and he was too busy having fun. He sucks.", "YTA\n\nHe was having fun as planned and unfortunately there was a family emergency\n\nNeither of you could have predicted that\n\nYou were understandably upset because you had to wait alone to see if she\u2019d be okay.

This was the time to rely on your own friends and family if you needed it and let him still have his very rare outing. If it were just a local having drinks with friends and watching a game ok then I'd be like he could have come home and been with you but this was a big deal to him. He hadn't seen some of these people in 15 years. It doesn't deserve to be disturbed for your grandma.

After he was already too far away to come home, drunk and with a flat phone.\n\nYou say yourself that you gave the trip your blessing and even facilitated it by paying for travel and clearing your schedule to be with the baby. You can't just rescind your permission for him to go out and have fun because something unexpected happened half way through.", "This kind of situation will come up again because you feel entitled to 'if you're not having a good time, he can't have a good time'. It's unfair. It's hard to get over too when you're caught up on the simple fact you're married entitles you to his full unconditional support whenever it's wanted. I've been in a relationship for over 13 years and struggled with this, but neither of us ever talked about how it made us feel. And it would blow up like this each and every time. (We're no longer together, but still live together as homeowners and parents)", "Yeah, im sure she never wanted him to go and leave her home with the baby.", "If \"everyone is saying you didn't want him to\"...that's because that's the image you're portraying in your comments.", "Yeah you have the choice to really listen to what people are trying to say OR just say everyone\u2019s wrong and you\u2019re right. Even though you\u2019re the one asking the question. YTA, but I understand your panic and fear. It\u2019s a stressful time and you wanted your husband to be available immediately to give you some comfort. But just because you want that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s going to happen. I want a lot of things. Part of life is understanding that reality just doesn\u2019t work out perfect all the time. You knew he was going to a reunion, and I would hope you would hope he has fun. That\u2019ll involve drinking and hey sometimes you get a little ahead of yourself. There\u2019s absolutely nothing he could have done and he was probably really hoping to see his old friend and have a blast. Your grandmothers situation is incredibly unfortunate and I\u2019m sure your husband would have been ready to give comfort and support when available. But it is something you are dealing with. My partners grandmother is going through health scares and I know it\u2019s been eating her up. But as much as I don\u2019t want her to feel bad and do care, I obviously don\u2019t \u201ccare\u201d in the same way or as much as she does. Where I\u2019m broken for days or crying. When you\u2019re being affected by it and in the situation you\u2019re always going to feel more passionately about it. And it can be overwhelming and you may want your person. But those feelings can\u2019t be directed at anger to him. He didn\u2019t do anything wrong by not being available immediately. If you really wanted to talk to him, you call the number and ask to speak with him. I\u2019m hoping you two get over this", "You said you forgot. Sounds like you didn't really pay attention to his needs, either. What if he had been in an emergency and needed you to call the police? You wouldn't have been very helpful to him, then?\n\nThat sounds ridiculous, right? That's what you're saying about him right now.", "You said in your post \u201c he said the name of the bar in passing a few times, but I couldn\u2019t remember it\u201d \u2026.", "Why didn\u2019t you ask him before he left?", "In another comment you said that he told you but you couldn't remember. If it was that important to reach him at all times, you should have kept note of the hotel and bar he was at.", "Why didn\u2019t you ask?", "You knew he was unavailable. He was out of town with friends. If the emergency involved you or your child, certainly, he should have rushed home. But this was your grandmother, who is in another state. There was literally nothing he could have done. Sure, he should have checked in on you, but you make it sound as though he should have dropped everything to sit on his phone. That doesn't seem reasonable.", "You absolutely know he was unavailable though? You knew what his plans were, and he got a message to you when his phone died.", "It wasn't about fixing my grandma it was about him making himself available and caring that I was in a crisis situation.", "We also have a baby and he would have been unreachable in any other emergency as well", "You don't understand this at all. His WIFE required his attention", "And sounds like he was drinking pretty hard to send a drunk selfie.  SMH", "Without context I had no idea what it even met. There was no text, just a drunken selfie.", "Yes there was! I can't believe people can't see this. He could have TALKED to her and made her feel less lonely and scared and helpless. It wouldn't have taken away from his fun for more than a few minutes.", "Literally no one is saying he shouldn't have gone on the trip but yes if my husband was worried sick about a close family member while I was away my priority would be \"what do you need and how can I support you\" not drunk texts via someone else's phone. Are y'all insane or have you just never had a single adult relationship? Or are you further incapable of going to a gathering and even having fun without getting wasted because going with a charged phone and less alcohol was *absolutely an option* here. \n\nOP you are NTA.", "It was still something that was difficult for me to think about while unable to reach my husband", "I just pray my grandsons\u2019 future wives will be more mature and stable. OP sounds manipulative.", "As he was getting ready to head out to the event my parents called and I had to walk them through calling 911 and trying to evaluate the situation over phone. I never told him not to go, I just expected him to be available for updates in an emergency situation or to check in at some point. He didn't check in the next day either.", "I don't understand why you can't have fun and also be available to your wife during a family emergency?", "How are you getting \"I didn't want him to have a good time\" from \"hey could you let me know how to reach you because I'm at home alone with the baby dealing with a family emergency?\" He didn't even let me know his phone was dying. And \"hey, now isn't the time to have random numbers text me drunk selfies when I'm scared my grandma is dying?\"", "That it is.  The expenses she paid juz facade not to show her resentment. Thats what i thought.  This is aita afterall", "Lots of \"me me me\" here.\n\nI'm really hung up on this:\n\n>I couldn't remember the name and I did not know the name of his hotel\n\nYou are more than an adult. This is something that should have been discussed prior to him leaving if it was important to you.", "But what could he have *done* is what I\u2019m asking? Did you just need him to be sympathetic? Like hang out on the phone with you? I\u2019m seriously asking. What specific action could he have taken that would have been acceptable?", "Available to do what?  Presumably you were talking to other family members. Talking to your drunk husband may not be as helpful as you would want. Let this go.", "OP,  you need to just stop. YTA in this scenario. You sent your husband off to an out-of-state reunion, i.e. a bender. He got drunk. It was clear when you got the selfie that he was drunk. So you needed to put on your big girl pants and deal with your own shit. If you need a shoulder to cry on, call your mom or a friend. In fact, you should have been commiserating with your family throughout the emergency. For some context, many of us moms have husbands that are overseas for months at a time on military postings. Others of us have husbands who travel for weeks at a time for work. Or maybe there's the occasional fishing trip with his guy pals. Different timezones make communication difficult. Sometimes you have to handle things. It's part of being a grown up. If you need 24/7 access to a sympathetic ear then you need to cultivate some friends.", "And if it HAD been an emergency with the baby, he still would've been a state over and unable to get to the hospital immediately. If you're not okay with him traveling to go to a reunion - which you know involved at least *some* alcohol - then tell him that before he goes to the reunion.", "But this wasn\u2019t an emergency with the baby and he wasnt unreachable here.", "You're being obtuse. In the future, all this stuff should be written down in a place you can find it. Get the names of places he expects to be, the name of the hotel, a friend's name as an emergency contact, and the numbers of all these places and people. It's not hard to think ahead and it's as much your fault as his that you didn't do this.", "Except he wasn't, you figured out that you could contact him at that number.  In fact you figured it out pretty quickly You're mad at him because,\" what if I didn't figure it out?\" Also I'm old so you remember the name of the bar and hotel your spouse is at, not remembering those things is right at the same level as not being clearer and text ,\" use this number\" \n\nAnd I don't think those things really matter as much as being hurt he wasn't as upset as you were when your grandmother was having an emergency. And while I completely understand the feeling it's not 100% reasonable, especially if he doesn't really know her because she's lived far away.", "If your baby has an emergency you know exactly what you would do.\n\nYou would text this friends number describing the emergency.\n\nIt's not a random number.  It's someone you know was near your husband", "A pic of hubby that isn\u2019t responding to texts and you don\u2019t know why he sent it? \n\nWow\u2026.just wow! YTA", "Talking to someone who is drunk is often not helpful.", "Geeze, no empathy here! Were you guys raised by wolves?", "How are you so certain he didn't do that when they talked after OP told her parents to call 911?  Additionally, how are you so certain that OP told her husband what she wanted in terms of support?\n\nI can't believe you can't see this.  OP left out the details of the aforementioned conversation they had, so why could she not have stated her wants/expectations rather than hope/wish her husband could mind read while hours away?", "Definitely the asshole, but I understand the panicked feelings.", "So your preference would have been to monopolise your husband's entire night while he was attending his reunion just so you could talk to him as emotional support for things that weren't even urgent/immediate? Yeah, YTA and if my wife had expectations like that I'd \"let my phone go flat\" when I was out with my friends too.", "He wasn\u2019t h reachable. You could have called his friend.", "So did you expect him to just be on the phone with you all night? I'm not really sure what you wanted him to do in this situation except for \"be available\", which is really vague.", "Girl just take the damn L \n\nA lot of people are against you and you are the AH\n\nYTA", "And what could he have done with those updates? Your parents were the ones dealing with the crisis, not you. You could only do as much as he could, receive updates by telephone.", "Okay, so from that evasive answer we can ascertain that you were talking to your family, and not him, as he was heading out. You couldn't have told him about the situation before you knew yourself, so I'm guessing that yes, your husband didn't know about the situation until he was interstate, at his reunion, drunk, and with a flat phone.", "It\u2019s the \u201cI expected him to -\u201c that I have a problem with. Did you communicate any of this to him or did you just literally expect him to read your mind? And, updating him on the situation and him being available for updates, quite literally has no tangible impact on the health of your grandmother or on the emergency at large. This is all very selfish logic OP.", "So, when in that timeline that does not mention when he knew you were having a crisis, did he actually know you were having one?", "YTA. If you needed that much support you should have asked him to stay in. There was absolutely nothing he could do over the phone and whether you like it or not, you knew how to reach him once he texted you from a random number.\nEven if you had an emergency yourself, there\u2019s not a damn thing he could do if he was farther than driving distance.", "If it was the baby, yes, omfg, yes. But as it involved your grandma, it's perfectly reasonable to handle it by yourself, and support your parents. It's also not a good idea to go into 'what ifs'. Focus on the facts. He was reachable. You could have waited until the morning to get his support. It's bloody rude checking your phone every few minutes. He would have surely been busy having fun anyway. If your grandma had taken a turn for the worse, grateful she didn't, you could have reached him.", "Im not sure why you dont get this or want to argue with everyone\n\nBut its because theres nothing he could do. He was unavailable and theres nothing you actually needed him to do.", "Available for what, EXACTLY?", "What did you want him to do about you being at home in another state with the baby, dealing with a family emergency?   What were your honest expectations?", "You said he got some random person to text you. That was a way of reaching him. It's hard, but you need to approach it with balance instead of a sense of entitlement", "Also, none of that was communicated to him until after? Probably should approach things like this when you're not emotionally charged. Think about all of the things that should have been communicated before he even left. This is the gist of a lot of other comments. You put yourself out there, and you will get answers that you're not going to like, but it's not hate. Just a different perspective.", "The main thing you are missing  - or maybe ignoring - here is, *what exactly did you expect him to do* in this emergency, or even in the potential of an emergency with the baby?  He's a state away, you have others taking care of your grandma. Would you have wanted him to drive back home? Would you want him to withdraw from his party waiting for your call/update? \n\nYou are angry he was at a party when your grandma was hospitalized, and that's a misplaced anger. If he was in the neighborhood, him cancelling his evening to contribute to help you would make sense. Otherwise it's simply that you are unreasonable. \n\nAs for your argument that he was not reachable of the baby had an emergency, that was true the very day he left your home to to visit his friends. Did you discuss plans with him for this eventuality? Fear of an emergency is no excuse to stop living a regular life, unless you can see specific steps that would help in that emergency.", "How are you 'dealing with a family emergency'?  You're literally no more help to the emergency than your husband could be.  You're mad about nothing and YTA.", "If you share your location on Google with your spouse it shows the other person's battery percentage. That's what my husband and I do and it solves a lot of confusion", "What were you doing to \"deal with\" this emergency? You note repeatedly that you were home alone with the baby. Were you suddenly not able to give your baby care because your grandma was in the hospital 2000 miles away? Were you unable to care for yourself? Could you not speak to your parents? Or were you just at home waiting for your phone to ring but doing nothing else of relevance to the family emergency?", "the question is, what exactly are you reaching a drunk man in a bar for? what kind of comfort do you think he'll give you in a moment like that?\n\nand you keep repeating that last line but his phone was dead so clearly he couldn't read it.", "I disagree and think you are being obtuse. She needed support from her partner because she was at home with a baby, her grandmother appeared to be at death's door and there was nothing she could do about it either.\n\nShe didn't say she wanted him to stay on the phone with her all night or get to the airport right now or even come home early. What she needed was for someone to give her a hug and tell her everything would be all right. She couldn't get the hug but he could have at least given her a conversation.", "I know that this is crazy but... He could have drunk less! And been sober to comfort his lonely and scared wife who he left alone with their one year old! Who he knew was in distress!", "This is true. In this circumstance it might have been, but we'll never know because he didn't even try", "His phone was on and he was getting ready at the hotel when it all happened. Idk how I'm being evasive.", "I\u2019m sorry to be callous but whether he has updates or not while on a party trip has absolutely no bearing on the situation. I get you wanted that, because you keep saying it, but that\u2019s what makes YTA here.", "You are argumentative (on here) and overall immature.  That doesn\u2019t bode well.", "When did he, your husband, know about this crisis?"]}
