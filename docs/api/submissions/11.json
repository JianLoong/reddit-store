For the record, it was a family event with grandparents, parents, and young children so no one dressed or acted inappropriately. Also, this involves my BIL\u2019s cousin (Sam, 26m) and his new wife (Jill, 24f), not my direct cousin.\n\nI (32m) have met Sam a couple of times before at various family function but we\u2019re not close. There\u2019s nothing wrong, it\u2019s just he\u2019s so much younger and our family is large. This was the 1st time I meeting Jill since they got married 6 months ago.\n\nWhen they came in, I shook both of their hands and greeted them with, \u201cthanks for coming\u201d. During dinner, she complimented me on my dish (it was pot luck) and I thanked her. That was the extent of our interaction. I didn\u2019t look at her or pay attention to her at all. At some point during the party, we heard a commotion in the backyard (most everyone was in the house) and some people went to see what\u2019s going on. When they didn\u2019t return, some more people went. Finally I went and come to find out, Sam and Jill are arguing. Basically Sam is accusing Jill of texting and flirting with me. I was confused because that didn\u2019t happen and I was busy every minute working the party (cooking, heating up food, getting ice, etc.). He made a grab for her phone to check her texts and she yanked it away. Then he saw me and demanded to see my phone. I refused because i didn\u2019t do anything wrong and no one is checking my phone without a warrant. This was enough got him to confirm we\u2019re texting each other. Words were exchanged and finally BIL dragged him out the door and told him to go home.\n\nOn the way out, he keyed my brand new car and kicked out the side mirror in front of everyone. My BIL had to hold me back. I yelled at him that he\u2019s fired so don\u2019t bother showing up for work tomorrow. \n\nSam doesn\u2019t work for me but we work at the same company. This company is a major employer in our city so several family members work there. I\u2019m a VP there and Sam is a low level employee under a different VP. Our state is an at will state which means he can quit at any time for any (or no reason) and we can fire him at any time and for any (or no reason). I plan to contact his VP in the morning but my family are trying to talk me out of it. They say it\u2019s cruel to fire him for just keying my car and breaking the mirror but I think I\u2019m justified because it shows he is emotionally unstable, not living in reality, and can\u2019t control his temper.

Not the end of the world if he showed him his phone, a little compassion could have helped.", "The whole \"at will\" state is more about terminating an employee not them quitting.  It means a company can fire you \"at will\" and they don't have to have a reason.", "Simply reported no. Had police reports and eye witnesses present who can attest to the distraction then yes. It's the same as asking would you fire someone that burned their neighbors yard.", "Watch out for the moving goalposts, but yes, of course.", ">It accomplishes nothing.\n\nIt accomplishes plenty. What a weird thing to say. *Your* idea of consequences makes sense and has him learn from his mistakes, but *this step* within them doesn't? \n\n>Real consequences require him having to pay fines and possibly service time...\n\nWho said those should not also be a part of his consequences?\n\nThese are extremely base-level consequences. Forgive me if I don't believe you if you were to say you would not report a fellow employee for destroying your property. It isn't even a selfish act, its to protect both yourself and your coworkers. \n\nAnd in what world do you see this as a NAH situation? You don't think the cousin acted as an asshole yet he does need a *civil suit filed against him*? I'm so confused.", "Again, even if HR did handle the complaint, Sam would probably be fired. A lot of employers don\u2019t tolerate criminal behaviour like that.

Most likely Sam would\u2019ve just had an extra week if OP didn\u2019t streamline the process", "So would non-guilty people.", "Or maybe, Sam is just a jerk. Why the sudden jump to a diagnosis based on this story?", "Why is it always everyone else's job to make this insecure fragile man content? If he can't act like an adult in a relationship he shouldn't be in one. Even if she cheated in the past it's no excuse as he would have had to take her back so it's either forgive and forget or break up. He doesn't get to act like this no matter the circumstances.", "Strong disagree. Sam was unhinged and beyond reality. I don\u2019t think anything would\u2019ve helped and OP has no reason for his conscience to not be clear.", "I agree that my second comment was slightly contradictory to my first, and absolutely I would report it to both the company and file a suit, but I do think it is slightly selfish to just get him out of your life and into someone else\u2019s where he could continue to be shitty when you could hold him accountable for his actions through the law instead. That is why I put NAH, but I should\u2019ve put ESH and the cousin much more so. But yes I would say it is slightly selfish of OP to take the easiest action for them that leaves Sam total authority to go continue to be a pain to others.\n\nMy contradiction about taking away his livlihood doesn\u2019t make sense, but I do still think people are substantially more likely to be better people if they aren\u2019t struggling to buy food", ">absolutely I would report it to both the company and file a suit\n\nBruh, then what are we talking about? lol. \n\nI love idealism and most definitely understand the relationship between poverty and crime, but you're taking it to a hypocritical level judging OP harsher than you would judge yourself.", "Because the way it reads that he wants him to be the decision authority on getting him fired, not just reporting it to the company.\n\nAnd I feel like expressing your standards on a topic is the whole purpose of this sub? How many people feel you are practicing standard behavior vs asshole behavior, no? For me, getting rid of a problem for just you is a *slightly* assholish behavior", ">Because the way it reads that he wants him to be the decision authority on getting him fired, not just reporting it to the company.\n\nThe same outcome will be reached. HR is certainly not letting something like this go. \n\n>expressing your standards...\n\nYour standards should be consistent between you and others. Otherwise, you will be called out as a hypocrite. \n\n>getting rid of a problem for just you is a slightly assholish behavior\n\n\"It isn't even a selfish act, it's to protect both yourself and your coworkers.\" And do you really want to try lambasting OP for caring about their property, therefore money, therefore well-being for not just themself but whoever they provide for?", "\"They say it\u2019s cruel to fire him for just keying my car and breaking the mirror\"\n\nVincent Vega would disagree.

This seems straight forward to me.", "Especially with so many witnesses.  Plus, he would have a record for vandalism which would definitely help the case of firing him.  Even though they are in an \"at will\" state, the employee can still sue the employer if they feel they were fired for wrong reasons.

Obviously he could just be a jerk but there are a lot of people with unmanaged psych conditions out there.", "I think you need to inform the police and HR to cover yourself. It is up to HR whether to inform his VP. And make a claim for the damage. Document everything and also get a couple of witnesses to write down their version .

I'd put hr in the loop and have them reference the employee handbook to see if these actions out of the workplace and not involving company property are against standards of conduct.
