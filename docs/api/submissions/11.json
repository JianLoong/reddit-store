My gf said since a hotel/airbnb costs way more than her plane ticket, she will pay for the hotel/airbnb this time and I can pay for her plane ticket. I was grateful and after she picked out a nice resort for us to stay at, I bought her a ticket.\n\nCue arguing. She's upset because the plane ticket I bought has a layover. She's mad because she's going to, in her own words, \"be stuck in an airport/plane for like 12 hours\" because I cheaped out and didn't buy her a direct flight. She also said that I know she's terrified of planes and now I'm making her take four of them instead of two (round-trip) so she doesn't even want the ticket anymore and will just cancel the trip entirely or buy her own ticket.\n\nI'm at a loss for words, I didn't know she would act this entitled. On the other hand though, I do feel a bit like I'm the AH because she has told me before how many times she hates layovers. AITA?\n\nEDIT: The layover time is between 4-5 hours.

She should just cancel the trip and save herself the money and headache.", "YTA. She got a nice resort for you both, and you cheaped out on the plane ticket with no thought of her comfort.\n\nEdit to add: OP, please add to the original post saying the 3.5 hr direct flight was $100 more. So to save $100 you chose to book the 12 hrs of flight and layover time for your girlfriend.", "YTA - Time is worth something and 12 hours is a long time. Was what you saved worth her sitting around for all that time? Why not just split the cost of both the plane and AirBnB? She picks the ticket and you both trade off choosing the place to stay or something like that.", "YTA, are you joking? Not only is she paying for the more expensive half so that you can go away together, but you\u2019ve called her ENTITLED for it whilst ALSO ignoring that she hates layovers, a fact she\u2019s made very clear?\n\nIf my boyfriend did this *without even discussing it with me* when I was paying for accommodation, I definitely wouldn\u2019t want to go, not least because I\u2019d be rethinking the relationship.", "YTA. Why didn't you ask her which flights to book, instead of just choosing the cheapest on her behalf?", "YTA\n\nAnd she\u2019s right, she offered to pay for a nice resort for both of you and you cheaped out on her plane ticket.\n\nYou know she\u2019s scared of planes and yet didn\u2019t even think to run this by her before you booked? Or did you just know she would be against it so you figured it\u2019s better to ask for forgiveness than permission? Either way you\u2019re TA. \n\nAnd then to say you think she\u2019s acting entitled?? \n\nYou really are boyfriend of the year!! Way to show her you care about her!! /s", "Did you not communicate with her before purchasing the ticket. I mean you\u2019ve been together for 5 years.

But my question is, you guys are doing a long distance thing and you ALWAYS  stay in a hotel or airBNB when she comes to visit you? What's wrong with your home/apartment? This seems weird.", "YTA as flights are bad enough these days even without factoring in layovers and you pretty much just doubled her travel time. Unless you\u2019re headed to a location where you have to do a layover from your home airport, always, always get the direct flight. Especially when someone is a nervous flyer!\n\nIf you have to include a layover, always check with the person you are buying a ticket for first. We recently had a direct flight changed to include a layover and even though I was 95% sure my husband would be fine with it, I still checked with him as he\u2019s a very nervous flyer.\n\nETA: After seeing how little the cost difference is ($100?!? WTF dude), you are even more TA then I thought. My mother is the queen of finding travel savings and she would even say YTA and just pay the damn $100. And this would be from a woman who once drove 4 hours to another airport for a flight. But that saved my parents almost $2,000 on ticket costs so at least it was justifiable.", "Yeah, YTA. You knew she hates layovers but still booked a flight with a significantly long one.\n\nShe\u2019s not being entitled, you\u2019re trying to cash in without putting anything up. You went full cheap but are going to benefit from her generosity.\n\nEdited to even bigger YTA after I saw OP\u2019s comment about the price difference being $100 and the travel time direct would be 8.5 hours less.\n\nIf you can\u2019t afford to spend the $100, you shouldn\u2019t be going on this trip. Period. Let your girlfriend save her money then.", "YTA, this could have all been avoided with a phone call to her before you booked the ticket. \n\nIt's a very long layover,  planes lately have been crazy unreliable and this is adding stress to your girlfriend's side of the trip.", "She paid for a nice place and you paid for a miserable hellish ride there, eh? Whataguy. YTA", "Without giving out itinerary information, where is her layover?", "YTA.\n\nIf you needed to do this for financial reasons, you should have discussed it with her first.\n\nWho's to say she wouldn't have been willing to contribute the extra $100 in order to avoid two hellish trips (because it sounds like she's got to take 2 multi-hour flights, with a 4 hour layover, in each direction)?\n\nWith all the sympathy towards your difficult situation financially, it has to be YTA because this particular decision to cut costs only negatively affects your GF.", "How much money was the difference? You probably should have got her a direct flight", "YTA, it's a $100 difference, you are a cheapskate. She is not acting entitled, you are acting disrespectful of her time. Cancel that ticket and fork out for a direct flight, to make up for your lousy move, I'd say make it business class!", "YTA. I\u2019m surprised you booked a flight for someone else without discussing the flight itinerary to make sure the times would be good. There should have been more communication, even if it was a direct flight.", "YTA.\n\nYou really chose the option of having her take 4 planes and spend half a day to come to you? Really? All to save just a $100? She paid for the most expensive part of this trip and you decide to go cheap? How is that fair?", "Info: Weren't there other options? A 12 hour layover is a pretty huge layover. I can understand why she would be upset...", "Info: were there direct flights and how much was the price difference?", "ESH. This is a stupid arrangement.", "YTA, for not doing something as simple as asking before you bought the ticket AND for how you\u2019re talking about her in this post when you\u2019re in the wrong. She isn\u2019t entitled, you\u2019re presumptuous.", "So, based on your post and comments, you knew she hates layovers. You knew she has anxiety around flying. You booked her a flight with a 4-5 hour layover each way, because it was just $100 cheaper, despite all the things you knew she hated about that decision. Additionally, every time you two spend time together, **she is the one who has to do all the traveling to get to you. You never travel to visit her, despite (again) knowing she has anxiety about flying.** She was even going to pay for the far more expensive end of this trip by paying in full for the accommodations you'd be sharing. \n\n**And despite that shit salad, you decided to sprinkle on the shitty bacon bits of calling her entitled?!?!?!**\n\nYeah. YTA.", "YTA like 12 hours ma dude, not cool for someone who does not like air travel.", "NO ONE wants connecting flights if direct is an option. You're basically telling her she isn't worth the money if you can do it on the cheap.\n\nYou should have discussed this with her first before you bought them. And since this is a cheaper flight. I assume they are non-refundable.  I understand money can be tight.  But this was not a good move on your part.", "Yta, layovers suck so bad. If there was an option without one, you should chosen it. You knew she hated layovers. What did you expect?", "NTA. $100 may be easy to swing for some people but it may not be for you. That $100 may be something you could put toward a bill or gas or food. Your gf is not wrong for being upset about having to do a layover but her response is childish. She thinks she\u2019s entitled to all this stuff and isn\u2019t being considerate of you and your financial situation.", "yta. When women complain about doing more emotional labor than their partners, this is what they are talking about. She was thoughtful to create a good experience for you by picking a nice resort and you claim to be grateful for that. Then you showed her your gratitude by valuing $100 over her comfort and booking her a crap flight without even talking to her about it. If she dumps you, it won't be because you don't have money. It will be because of your decision-making skills, lack of emotional intelligence, and your disregard for her as a person.", "INFO: \n\nAre you trying to end the relationship without having to do the work of initiating an uncomfortable conversation?", "YTA\nYou know she\u2019s scared of flying any you doubled the number of flights she needs to take to save $100 (as per your comment).", "YTA - but wouldn\u2019t it have just been easier to continue communicating your financial standpoint and ask her to cover the extra 100(?). Pay her back later, or ask someone for a loan if at all possible. She\u2019s your girl, you want her comfortable and happy such as she does you my friend", "YTA. So you know she hates layovers. Know she hates flying. Know shes paying for the way more expensive portion of the trip, but go ahead and book a 5 hour layover for her without so much as a phone call? This isn\u2019t entitled, I\u2019d be pissed too. If you really couldn\u2019t afford whatever the price difference was then at least call her and maybe she pays the difference. And a 5 hour layover? My dude, a layover shouldn\u2019t be longer than most domestic flights. \n\nAll I know is that regardless of her reaction if you\u2019re so hard up for money right now that you\u2019re willing to save money by inconveniencing the person treating you to the majority of you trip, you\u2019re going to have a miserable vacation. Hopefully this resort is all inclusive and you don\u2019t plan on spending a dime extra on anything. It would really be best for you to postpone this until you can actually afford it.", "Yta. She is being generous and you cheaped out. Plus it is her time! And these days layovers are very stressful", "EH.  On one had how much does she want to see you that a 5 hr layover is a deal breaker?  On the other hand could you really not afford the direct flight?  Seems like a small hill to die on for both sides.  This is what distance relationships don't work out.", "INFO: from where to where? A layover is not a big deal and she\u2019s making it a massive one but it depends where you\u2019re flying. If it\u2019s NYC to Texas, YTA but when I was in FL it was hard to find a direct JAX to MSP without hitting Atlanta first for a layover. Depends on the flight IMO but layovers are normal", "YTA. I was on the fence until you mentioned that she already told you about her fear of flying and not liking layovers.", "YTA for making her fly more when she hates flying and calling her entitled for not wanting a layover because of it. \n\nIf you are running into money problems, it might be worth seriously considering picking up a side job like door dash. \n\nI hope this is a speed bump in your relationship.", "YTA.  She told you she hates layovers many times before and you decided to buy layovers ticket?", "YTA would you select a 12-hour duration travel time for yourself? A 4-5 hour layover is ridiculous.", "YTA. You have the hide to call her entitled?? 5 hours waiting in an airport is a ridiculous option if there are direct flights. She was trying to be fair by paying for the accomodation and you didn\u2019t return the kindness. You should just cancel this trip, you won\u2019t be getting laid lol.", "YTA...now give her money for the air bnb", "YTA. Wow. She isn't worth 100 dollars? You could have told her you couldn't pay and paid her back later.", "YTA. 4 planes with a 12 hour layover? I don\u2019t mind flying but I wouldn\u2019t do that.", "I\u2019m going to say NTA.  All of these other commenters look at it from her perspective but let\u2019s be honest here.  OP might actually have needed that $100 to put gas in their car, food on the table, money to send to family, some money to fucking breathe these days because we all know everything is so god damn expensive.  \n\nNow to further my post, I still say NTA.  Who gives a shit about sitting in an airport for 4-7 hours extra? Find a comfy spot next to a charger (or bring your own extra like a normal traveler) and watch a few shows, read a book, people watch.  Not like any of you reading this aren\u2019t already glued to your phone anyways.  My man is low on funds and still trying to make it to a fun weekend for the both of them.  If that\u2019s ruined by an extra flight I\u2019m going to say he should rethink the relationship with her.", "YTA. A 5 hour layover? Are you kidding me? If I were her I would cancel the trip. Geez what an AH", "YTA \n\nSince you mentioned she hates layovers why did you buy one in wich she has to change not 2 but 4 planes.", "It all you can afford is this itinerary, the NTA, but if you\u2019re simply being cheap, then YTA.

I can almost guarantee it's not worth it. \n\nAnd add to that the fact that you are already paying LESS THAN YOUR SHARE of this trip since the resort cost more than the flight (assume she made this calculation based on a direct flight since she assumed you'd buy that) and you show your gratitude by trying to cheap out on your end of the bargain? \n\nYTA.
