Or, he could've provided proper means of transportation for her and not assume I'd go there when I'm not welcome. We had an argument and she ended up being taken there by my brother.

Makes me wonder why your son has no problem washing his hands of you", "YTA - BE NICE TO YOUR WIFE. You seem easy to get on with which probably why your son isn't talking to you. Also you ARE absolutely punishing your wife for your sons decision.", "YTA\u2026you took out your situation and frustration on her. Between you and your son, someone should have made arrangements for her to get to the wedding but you are her husband! Sure you say you didn\u2019t argue about not being invited but making it hard for your wife to get there qualifies as trying to stick it to your soon for excluding you and you know that.", "ESH.\n\nYour son for only inviting his mother and not making arrangements for her knowing she's disabled and can't drive.\n\nYou for punishing her because of the conflict you have with your son just as she said.", "Idk man. You wouldn't drive your disabled wife to her son's wedding? Hard for me to look past that even when considering the other info. YTA.", "YTA.  Yes a 3 hour drive is a huge burden, but this is very important to your spouse.   Sometimes we make sacrifices for our children and loved ones.  Also given that this conflict was about a property that is objectively none of your business and how cagey you are about the details, I suspect you know in your heart the lack of invitation is deserved.  This comes off as an excuse to be petty and controlling.  For once put the needs of the people you claim to love first", "NTA. Your wife can find transportation for herself, or your son could have arranged for some. The only possible way I see you being the AH is about him selling the house. Was it his house? Because if she left it to him, you get no say in what happens to it", "YTA\n\nIf you were anywhere near as callous to your son in the past as you were to your wife here then no wonder he wants nothing to do with you.", "YTA you punished your wife because you are angry at your son, that\u2019s not right", "INFO: When did you tell her you weren\u2019t taking her to the wedding? If you usually are her sole mode of transport and she had no reason to expect you wouldn\u2019t take her to the wedding, YWBTA.", "YTA dude, yea you don\u2019t talk to your son, doesn\u2019t mean you leave your disabled wife who can\u2019t drive in the lurch.", "YTA. That\u2019s all I have to say.", "NTA\n\nYour son is being completely unreasonable if he expects you to drive six hours (three each way) for an event you're specifically **not** invited to, just to drop your wife off and pick her up.\n\nThe big AH here is your son, for putting you in this position.", "YTA\n\nYou could have told her from the beginning that she needed to get her own ride and not wait until the wedding day or close to wedding day.  Your wife is right and i get why your son is LC with you", "ESH. (except wife and her bro) Thats a stupid reason not to be on speaking terms especially since it wasn't your own mom's house. I'm sure there's more details, but that's a dumb reason.\n\nYour son knows his mom is disabled he should not have assumed as much that you would be driving her especially if you weren't invited. Was he expecting you to drive 3 hours and sit in the car? Maybe, but you shouldn't have to in this case because you weren't invited.\n\nAlso partially on you though because I get the vibes you did not give your wife a far out enough warning that you weren't planning on driving and probably told her 2 days before or something.", "Dude, YTA. So much. It's simple, what your wife says was right.  \n\n\nThis makes me winder about your fissured relationship with your son. Holding transporatation over your disabled wife makes it hard to imagine you are in the right within any 'loving family' issue.  \n\n\nNothing you can't fix...work at it.", ">  but didn't include me. I was fine with that, didn't try to fight back or anything.\n\n...\n\n>  I said that since I'm not invited to the wedding, nor am I taking part in it then I shouldn't have to drive there. \n\nYTA - You need to pick one stance on the wedding, not both.", "Why doesn't my son talk to me?\n\nYTA OP", "Info: what was the argument about?", "YTA \n\nShe\u2019s right, you were punishing her because of your sons decision. If she hadn\u2019t been able to find an alternative ride then she would\u2019ve been trapped at home and unable to go.\n\nYou would\u2019ve forced her to miss something really important because your feelings are hurt and your ego is bruised.\n\nForget the drama with your son, this puts you in the bad husband category", "ESH, you should\u2019ve have to go when you weren\u2019t invited, but also as a the partner to your wife, you should at least make sure she gets there okay, like did you try at all? It sounds like you didn\u2019t try and just left her hanging", "ESH except for your wife and your brother. You and your son are not talking to each other over a disagreement. If he inherited the house it\u2019s obviously his right to sell it so you\u2019re further ahead of your son in this situation obviously. Your wife is disabled and relies on you for transportation. I guarantee that she cried her eyes out while traveling with your brother because her husband is being selfish and cruel to make a point about something that wasn\u2019t his business anyway. Your son is included because he\u2019s playing the same stupid game that you are right now with only inviting his mom, but grow up. You\u2019ve been in the wrong from the start on this. Apologize to your poor wife and expect it to take a lot of work and multiple apologies to even start making up for this. Then apologize to your son and butt out of his financial decisions in the future.", "YTA. You said your wife is *disabled*. Quit taking your disappointment and frustration about your son\u2019s actions out on your wife. It\u2019s pretty sad she had to ask YOUR brother for a ride because you\u2019re being a stubborn ass stuck on your high horse.", "YTA (soft). I mean I get your point that your son didn't invite you and that there is bad blood between you. I don't blame you for being hurt. But it would have been a class act to drive your wife to the wedding....she's your life mate, she deserves some consideration under these difficult circumstances. Your brother driving her is not a good look for you as her husband. I think apologizing to her would be a good move.", "INFO: Why is it that you seem to think you should have a say in your grown son\u2019s finances ?? What\u2019s it to you if your MIL\u2019s house is sold?? Sounds like you wanted some money or a free house to live in & now you think you punished your son when you really punished your DISABLED WIFE. You\u2019ve shown you\u2019re willing to take things out on her & I would be looking for a lawyer if I was her.", "NTA, I won\u2019t speak for the mess that is your family life but you never have to drive six hours to an event you specifically were told not to come to.", "INFO: When did your wife ask for a ride? How would she get home, and so on? \n\nI'm not touching the issues between you and your son for this. But were you expected to drive 3 hours, hang out somewhere for the duration of the wedding and reception, and then drive three hours again?", "YTA. Like. Dude, come on. Seriously.", "YTA.  Now your being spiteful to your son and taking it out on your wife.   No wonder your son isn\u2019t talking to you and didn\u2019t invite you to the wedding", "You're a jerkoff and you're gonna lose your wife too. Good luck asshole", "Oddly enough\u2026. I\u2019m stuck between E S H -and- N A H\n\nWhatever issue you have with your son should never come between you and your wife, and I assume that until this wedding, it hasn\u2019t really come to a head like this?\n\nThat said, I personally wouldn\u2019t drive 6 hours for something I wasn\u2019t invited to, and all the Y T As are kind of ridiculous if they truly say they would. Your wife got to the wedding (INFO: Was your brother invited? Or did he drive because you wouldn\u2019t?)\n\nYour son should have (or could have) made arrangements to get his mother there, and he didn\u2019t. I\u2019m still kind of on the fence, I guess\u2026", "YTA\n\nI guess instead of having issues with your son, it's time to move on to your wife? Really not sure what your goal was, or what you thought the end game in this would be.\n\nMaybe drop your pride a few notches, and have some compassion for your wife, at the least.", "YTA. And a petty one at that. Also willing to bet you left out a ton of info because it would make you look even worse. You really should apologize to your wife and your son.", "I have sooo many questions.\n1 if it was your wife's mother and not yours, why were you so upset about your son (who inherited it I suppose?) selling it?\n\n2 what did you do? There is something you are not telling us, what did you do to upset your son so much?
