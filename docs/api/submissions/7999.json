Did you make up a fact where he's throwing a fit to somehow construct a narrative where he has ulterior motives for not driving her, therefore making him an asshole to you?", "No. No wife or husband is entitled to wasting 6 hours (+ waiting hours) of their spouse's time driving to and from an event the spouse is explicitly excluded from. It shows a complete lack of respect for the husband's time and feelings to expect him to do this", "Well then, that's his dad. You invite him to your goddamn wedding. Especially if you want your mom there, and know she can't get there without your dad driving. \n\nIf the son really just wanted his mom to attend with no other ill intentions, he would have found a way for her to travel without the dad. Instead the son tried to pull a fast one on his dad to make him suffer. His dad didn't go for it, and you people are blaming the dad because you sympathize with the mom.\n\nWhich, I understand the sympathy for the mom. But this specific comment thread was about the son being justified in excluding his dad, which means his dad doesn't have to drive anyone to his son's wedding. And it's still unreasonable for the mom to ask him to drive 6 hours.", "I have sympathy for his wife, the son should have made accomodations for her, or alternatively, the wife can make her own accommodations like OP suggested.

Yeah nicely put. So you would not go to your son's wedding if your husband wasn't invited? Even if he was a dick and 100% deserved not to be invited?", "Yeah driving 6 hours with your wife and then enjoying yourself some for few hours, so your wife can be with her son for his wedding is \"unreasonable\".\n\nI'd be interested to be around when your gf reads this post and your opinion \ud83c\udf7f", "Again, it depends on the relationship between the guy and his spouse. It's not a black and white situation, at least not to me.\n\nBut if my husband was entirely dependent on me to go anywhere, then just \"not being invited\" isn't a reason to abandon him.", "I don't disagree, but I wanted room in what I said for people to have other kinds of agreements than the kind i would have.\n\nI myself would have driven my spouse to the wedding because the driving is about my spouse not me or the wedding. But I can see how there might be agreements depending on the other person's abilities or needs etc.", "I\u2019m just being a smart ass but at least they let you into the church.", "That's a really great gesture that you do! You're a gem.", "Yeah but this is a wedding. There\u2019s plenty of people who could take her who are actually going to the wedding.", "Or he could\u2019ve invited his father despite their falling out, especially knowing the situation.", "I don't understand why people are acting like this was a trip for a concert. This was a one time major life event. The length of the trip means much less if you're not intentionally downplaying the importance of the event. I've driven 6 hours round trip after a 16 hour shift for a girlfriend because her mom was taken to the hospital (but was fine and we knew this before leaving). We weren't even married. She wasn't disabled, just frazzled. I can't comprehend treating someone you love like this.", "i mean sure, if you wanna act like complex situations and relationships are that one-dimensional, be my guest!", "It might matter, though.\n\nLike, if the son has a bad history with both parents, largely driven by the son\u2019s behavior, the invitation only to his mom could have been less than genuine because he knew that she couldn\u2019t go without his dad and thus he was aiming for strife. I wouldn\u2019t really consider OP TAH in that type of situation. It would be coming from a place of justified pain on OP\u2019s behalf and he is just refusing to engage in games.\n\nConversely, if the situation is driven by OP\u2019s selfishness with a history of selfishness on OP\u2019s part, the lack of invitation to OP is justified and a failure to drive his wife is just own more selfish act on his part and he would be TAH.\n\nAnd there\u2019s a range of realities in between. \n\nLike, E-S-H exists as an option, but that requires some context. I feel like I am completely missing why this is happening.", "They said \u201cit is ok to ask *for something like that*\u201d\n\nI don\u2019t know what to tell you. You should have finished reading the sentence.", "I would drive 6 hours round trip to pick up a (close) friend from the airport, I HAVE driven 4 hours round trip to get food.  For my spouse?  Wouldn't even be a question. OPs issues with their son have nothing to do with this situation. The wife is the one being punished here. I find it hard to believe that OP wouldn't be able to find something to do in the town 3 hours away to spend some time.", "You enjoy your SO, you don\u2019t love them. You\u2019re only interested in doing what they need if it\u2019s convenient.", "I'm disabled and I just dragged my broken body onto ferries, planes, and buses to make it to a funeral. When it's important, you make it work. My SO couldn't drive us and he probably would have felt out of place so I went alone because I am an adult with disabilities. Unless she needs a 24/7 care aid, OP has done nothing wrong. Even if his wife needed a care aid, it shouldn't fall to him!\n\nHer brother took her and everything worked out. There was obviously a work around. She still got to go to the wedding and her husband didn't have to drive 6 hours to not go to a wedding.", "If the brother lives in the same place sure it sounds indeed better. But it depends also on the car and OP's wife disability. Maybe OP's car is affairs to his wife disability, and to transport maybe a wheelchair. It might not be the case for the brother.\nMaybe OP's wife was hoping to convince her son to see his dad, who knows.\n\nIn any case it's not a crazy request from the wife, and we are lacking a lot of context", "No, he didn't go to his oldest daughter's wedding, well they were already married, it was a redo for family a few years later.  She got mad because I couldn't make it to her bridal shower and he wouldn't walk his ex wife down the aisle & into the reception. So she uninvited me. He told her we're a package deal.", "It helps that I grew up Baptist so I understand the culture, but I'm 99% sure I'm allowed in so the Nanas can try to matchmake me with a \"nice boy\" before I turn 30. I'm fresh meat.\ud83d\ude02", "Depends. Are there people who live nearby that have cars that a disabled person could use? Do they have room in said car to transport her \nmobility equipment?\nIt's not as simple as 'get a ride from someone'.", "If the dad fucked up and was controlling/abusive/neglectful to his son then he'd be an AH for not realising that and trying to do right by his son by helping his wife get to the wedding. If the son was the shitty one and he just didn't like the fact that his father refused to enable his shitty behaviour, then his father would not be TA for holding a grudge against his son in that way. \n\nBecause that's what this situation is, op isn't refusing to attend his son's wedding on moral grounds or anything, he's upset that he wasn't invited. Something happened that messed up their relationship, and op feels that whatever he did was justified (or, at least that his son should get over it and invite him to the wedding) so he's refusing to help his disabled wife to attend. It's absolutely integral to the judgement to know what happened in the relationship because without that info you can't judge whether op's grudge is justified.", "Did your gf's mom specifically forbid you from being in her presence at the hospital because she hates you? Not to mention that a ride to the hospital is a more urgent need than what's essentially a party you're not invited to.\n\nAnd that's great that you did that for your gf, that makes you a really nice person. Doesn't make OP an asshole for not doing what you did.", "I don't know, maybe logical thinking isn't your forte, that apples have nothing to do with oranges. Whatever the reason for him not being invited has nothing to do with whether or not he should have given his wife a ride. Even if it was a game on the son's part she wanted to go and she wanted him to give her a ride. Whether or not he should have given her a ride is the only question here.\n\nYou all are just looking for gossip and are just trying to determine whether to like or hate the person based on other events and then render an opinion according to that.", "Neither was I. Driving 6 hours and waiting 6h+ (?) alone for your wife to celebrate the wedding of your Son, in which you were not invited nor wanted, it is not reasonable to ask.", "First, to me Six hours are little for a wedding, which helps to see we are thinking about different timeframes.\n\nBut even forgetting that, i think you are simply thinking in terms of killing time, and not in terms of killing time Alone because you are waiting for your wife to finish Celebrating the wedding of your Son, an event you were not invited and are not wanted!\n\nIt is significantly more emotional and disturbing than just \"no biggie, I can see Avatar\".", "Four hours to get food? Where do you live, the South Pole?", "Your SO sounds like a waifu pillow- and you\u2019d KILL for her, because you are trained in the ways of the blade", "Bulllllllll shit. There is caring for and loving your partner and supporting them, and there is being a doormat.\n\n6 hours to hang out in a new place just to be alone and not allowed to leave until the end of a wedding (such a classically quick event) is torturous. That's an insane undertaking to force on someone when there was obviously a work-around that ended up working for her in the end.", "Imagine thinking there's enough context here to empath this bs", "This is one of those posts where OP might not technically be TA in this scenario but it seems likely he's TA in situations AROUND this particular question.", "Huh?", "There is no indication she isn't self sufficient other than driving. I have several close family members with disabilities and they would be insulted someone thought they had to be cuddled rather accommodated.", "He\u2019s not going because he\u2019s not invited, regardless of how he feels about not being invited. Is he obligated to drive his disabled wife three hours each way, presumably waiting in between, to a wedding he\u2019s not going to? That\u2019s all; that\u2019s the question. \n\nBy your logic, he\u2019s obligated to do anything his son might ask of him or even anything anyone else might ask related to the son, if he wronged the son in the past. That\u2019s obviously ridiculous. \n\nSomeone might feel he\u2019s the AH because his wife relies on him due to her limited mobility and difficulty getting herself there. They might feel that he\u2019s not the AH because his wife is an adult who should be able to make her own arrangements to get where she\u2019s going without asking such an extreme imposition of him. The answer may depend on what the husband and wife said or didn\u2019t say about how she would get there before he told her he wasn\u2019t driving. \n\nWhat isn\u2019t relevant is who\u2019s to blame in the prior conflict with the son. If he told his wife explicitly as soon as she got the invitation that he wasn\u2019t driving her, then he\u2019s N T A regardless of whether he wronged his son previously. If he said he would drive her and then reneged at the last minute, he\u2019s T A regardless of whether the son was completely wrong before.", "Are you the OP because you sound like you might be?", "Ah yes 12 hours wasted to make your wife happy on one of your son's most memorable day of his life. Imagine all the ball scratching he could do instead", "For me sitting at home and knowing I was inconveniencing my wife in what should be a nice day for her would be pretty emotionally disturbing as well. \n\nAnd if this was a 12 hour wedding, just get a hotel room. That actually makes it easier. Sheesh. Really not that complicated.", "Not sure how wedding invitations work in your country but usually someone like husband and wife would get a shared invitation so she should have known well in advance that he wasn't invited.", "Sometimes you just really need a specific food from a specific restaurant and the closest one was 2 hours away. I didn't do it alone though, I had a friend with me.\n\nAnd I'm in Canada, so it's the North Pole. Though to be fair I did grow up in rural northern Canada and the next closest town was 8 hours away. Not that we drove out of town often, once a year at most, but it does give me a slightly different perspective on what a long drive is.", "I don't think it was an actual work-around, sounds more like the brother stepped up where op failed.", "Yeah, how does he manage to cut ties of property inherited from the OTHER side of the family.", "Yup, n t a for kor wanting to drive 6 hours but saying 'its on you to make arrangements, you're an adult' to a disabled partner trying to make it to a once in a lifetime event scream pettiness, and I'm willing to bet this kind of pettiness is the reason son doesn't talk to him.", "And he was probably even happy to do so. Yikes!", "Coddled. \n\nCuddled is entirely different.", "I am not the OP.\n\nBut that's interesting that, rather than addressing what I said, you try to find some secret hidden thing to call me out on.\n\nIn a sense, you're doing the same thing as the other people, who are trying to find some secret, hidden reason for the son not inviting the father, instead of just dealing with the facts about whether or not it made sense for the father to spend all day driving his wife back and forth for six hours and sitting around for about six hours.", "You are clearly writing as if it was just a wife thing, and not a scenario that could elicit a personal and emotional reaction from you. I seriously doubt that if this was your son, you would just go \"well, this is just a nice day for her, let's go\". But if you believe that, strenght to you."]}
