Do better for yourself", "NTA - Sounds like you are doing pretty much everything TBH.\n\nI think you should start counseling (for you) right away because your perspective on what is acceptable behavior has been skewed by years of living with this manipulative user.   You and your child deserve better.", "NTA but you are to yourself.  Why put up with this type of behavior?  You need to get some confidence and self esteem and a back bone and get out of this.  You deserve better, however you have to understand your self worth and love yourself so you can be a great parent for your child.", "NTA in this situation but I gotta include the standard E S H for being with this man for over a decade, knowing what he's like, him steadfastly not changing, and still purposefully having a kid with him because he said he'd change. He's not gonna change. He was never going to change. And now you've added a kid to the equation.", "NTA but girl\u2026 to many red flags, run", "He sounds like a selfish abuser you are better off without him NTA", "Exactly that\u2019s narcissistic projecting 101.", "This!", "My friend was like this. A con artist used her from her teens until she was 28. Although the current guy is not as bad it is still a terrible choice.", "Possibly harming the kid, but likely it won\u2019t really really start until the child is old\nenough to understand human emotions.  \n\nI divorced this same exact\npersonality.  It is a much better life!", "Echoing that this is not a safe environment OP. Your poor child is alone with him all day. \n\nNTA, but please don\u2019t bury this wake up call.", "Preach! :)", "Agree NTA but do you know how much it\u2019s going to suck when she\u2019s paying him palimony after being leeched on for so long?", "I know. A loser hasn't worked in a decade but all of a sudden he will? If you are that desperate the con artists will always find you.", "Why would any sensible person believe someone is going to get a job when they used you for 10 years? He is a con artist.", "I\u2019d set up day care and then kick him out. \n\nWhat exactly is this man contributing to their home?\n\nThere\u2019s nothing wrong with doing unpaid work for the family, but it doesn\u2019t sound like he\u2019s doing much of that\u2014and he\u2019s angry and resentful about the little he does do.", "Exactly! It\u2019s entirely his fault if his life and their son\u2019s life are boring. Wtf do they do all day? He should be taking the kid to the park, the library (tons of activities there!), the museum, or even the mall to walk around. He puts forth zero effort into enriching their lives and blames his wife.
