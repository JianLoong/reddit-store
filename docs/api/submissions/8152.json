We get along great and have a lot of fun together but this incident is the only thing that's making me question things. \n\nBackground info: we live in Canada in a place where winter hits hard. This is important. \n\nA month ago we were working out in his garage organizing and what not and he realized he needed a specific tool to fix the boat motor he had. He called his friend \"Tom\" (37m) and asked if he could borrow it. Tom said yes, gave us his address and we agreed to go by the next day. \n\nWhen we showed up we realized that his house was a soft tent trailer on a lot. No judgement! Everyone has to have housing and if it's working for him that's great. Until we went inside. \n\nTurns out Tom and his gf \"Stacy\" (35f?) Had just had a baby. Like I'm talking less than 3 mo old. The two of them, the baby, and two massive bull mastiff dogs were living inside this trailer with 1 small space heater. I was absolutely shocked. Not only that but the place reeked of dog piss and clearly hadn't been cleaned in weeks. We stayed for a bit, got the part we needed and left. \n\nAs a mom myself I was so upset by seeing that baby. Luckily it was still tiny but I know kids grow fast and that isn't the place to raise a kid. When my bf and I talked about it, he said he offered them room in his house or even to park the trailer in his garage (it's a huge garage more like a house without rooms) but they turned him down. \n\nI sat on this for a couple days and then decided I couldn't do nothing. I called my local CPS, told them the story and gave them the address. About a week later bf gets a call from Tom absolutely freaking out because CPS came by and did an investigation and deemed it unsafe for the kid. They have a certain amount of time to get new housing or else they risk further action against them. Again my bf said they could stay with him but Tom refused because he could \"provide for his family\". \n\nWhere I feel like an asshole is apparently Stacy is absolutely distraught and won't stop crying and panicking that she's going to lose her baby. Again, as a mom I can't imagine that but I also can't imagine letting my baby live in a tent trailer in -20C weather with only a space heater.

You did exactly what you should have done, and that was affirmed by the actions of CPS.  If they want to have children, they need to provide appropriate and safe housing for them.

It was hard and likely will always be but you did the right thing.", "NTA\n\n> Tom refused because he could \"provide for his family\".\n\nClearly, no he can't.\n\nHe's putting his pride over his child's health. Sure, he might want to live in a tent, I'm sure it's nice and cheap, but providing for your family also means keeping them SAFE and HEALTHY.
