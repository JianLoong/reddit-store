She claims it's ruining her mental health but she's too selfish to think about yours. Keep ignoring her and I hope you move out soon.

Why would a bit of gossip (because that's what it is to her, not a genuine concern for your feelings) cause her mental anguish?\n\nNTA. You never owe anyone personal info. I'm glad your dad can be a trusted person for you. \n\nWhen mom asks again, look at her with deep concern and ask if she's OK. \"Mom, we've had this conversation multiple times.

First of all, its your business and not hers. The choice is yours to share or not. You have good reasons not to confide the information in her because she likes to use it in retaliatory outbursts in an attempt to cause more damage. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSounds like she doesnt have a very high maturity level mixed in with a victim complex and is manipulative. Dont let her (or anyone) manipulate or bully somebody into giving information you do not want to, and dont feel bad about it either.

To avoid the dramatic escalation don't volunteer any extra info like talking to your dad about.\n\nYou could of let her think you would talk to her about it in the undefined future, and let that never happen.\n\nA little social akido, makes things go smoother.\n\nHere is the thing, you cannot change your mom, so why waste your time having the battle?  If she is explosive and uses slights against you, why engage?  Will finessing her mean your relationship with her will cool and grow a little distant?  Yes, but it's that or continual blow ups.\n\nLike many things, it comes down to the question of do you enjoy drama or not?

You don\u2019t say how old you are but if she\u2019s doing this stuff, *someone* needs to be informed so they can look out for the mental health of the kids in her care. Is there a therapist in the picture? A school counselor you can trust? If not, maybe your dad could get counseling for your siblings while they\u2019re with him.\n\nAnyway you\u2019re absolutely not doing anything wrong by defending your privacy and your mother has no right to use emotional blackmail on you. The adult is responsible for the well-being of their child, not the other way around.", "Another way of looking at is that the mom is never going to change.  So you can trade blows with her because you have no self control, weak social skills, or just enjoy the fight....\n\nOR\n\nYou can put her on an information diet and train the mom to get used to that and minimize the BS.  In this case, an easy way to do that is to vaguely agree to talking about it in the future and then that never happens.\n\nThat sort of stuff is pretty easy to do with self discipline and thought."]}
