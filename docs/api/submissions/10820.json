She had made it clear that she is insecure about her weight and doesn't like talking about it due to me and her kids commonly (mostly on accident) making jokes about her weight).\n\n I (14m) was on a drive back from my step grandma's house. We had been in the car for a couple minutes so we decided to play I-spy. My step-brother (7m) had said he spied the biggest thing in the truck so I impulsively said my step-moms name for a quick laugh but my mom didn't like the joke (fair enough). For the next couple of minutes she doesn't say anything (that's fair). Eventually my Dad (37m, I know the age gap is kinda weird)  had asked her a question. This caused her to throw a fit about how no one in the family respected her and how her life had been worse because misogynistic men had disregarded her due to her oversized body. I obviously felt bad but I have a problem where whenever I feel sad I shut down as a coping mechanism so talking to her was very hard for me to do in the situation. \n\nEventually she had calmed down and talked to me normally about how she didn't like people making fun of her in that way (fair enough) but that wasn't the problem. When she had talked about how all her life she had been put down by sexist men it made me feel like I was a bad person for making these jokes. Eventually we had gotten to her ex's house to drop off her kids so it was me alone in dads truck. I started to cry, hard as I am a very sensitive kid. Thoughts kept rushing through my head about how I was a misogynist and how i was an awful person. \n\nA couple minutes later my dad came back and asked me what was wrong. I was in a very bad state so I kept saying \"I didn't want to talk\" and \"Talking would only make things worse\" till my step mom arrived. My dad stepped out of the truck and asked her to talk to me as I was not talking very well to him. She got in the truck and tried to talk to me but I thought if I talked it would make things worse so I just kept saying I didn't want to talk about it. Eventually we got home and I rushed upstairs to my room where for the next day or two I would cry on and off and for the past couple of weeks I've had a feeling that I'm not a good person so I would like honest feedback just to know if I was in the wrong on this.

You won't find too many people in your life who will let you get away with these so called jokes of yours as you get older.", "apologizing for something you did but then keep doing it isn\u2019t an apology.", "She is teaching you it's not right to make fun of people and teaching you why it's wrong. You should feel bad because you were doing an awful thing. You say she hasn't tried to talk in anyway but in your post you mention you shut down and said you didn't want to talk about it so which is it? You need to learn what is and isn't acceptable.", "She didn't make you \"hate yourself.\" She told you that you hurt her and she told you why your continued hurtful behavior towards her was painful. If you feel guilty and bad that's a GOOD thing because that would show some remorse and some self-reflection. You should feel bad about mean-spirited digs about other people's bodies, it's objectively an unkind thing to do when someone has previously told you it hurts them. You crying on the kitchen table was you making this all about you and trying to deflect away from her injury. You aren't the victim here as much as you would like to play that role which makes your claims of guilt and hating yourself ring completely false. It's attention seeking and gross. She doesn't owe you an apology.", "Yeah. I would. If said \"child\" thought he could be nasty and disrespectful to me yet expected his feelings to be respected and protected. Jeez", "You said in your OP that you knew \"jokes\" like this hurt her. She's made it clear to you that jokes like this hurt her yet you continue to do it, so she snapped.\n\nWas it the perfect thing to do? No. But she's human and after telling her family several times that jokes about her weight are hurtful, they continue to do it.\n\nShe doesn't owe you an apology because you're throwing toddler like temper tantrums weeks later. That's on you. You did something shitty and are now facing the consequences, welcome to the rest of your life. It's not up to others to make you feel better after you've done a bad thing to them", "You know who insults granny? A bad person. You feel guilty because your actions brought you shame. Grow up and learn to be a better person if being a bad person makes you feel so bad. \n\nVictims don't have to make a bully feel better.", "yeah, as the granny should. because what you did was a horrible thing to do. maybe it doesn\u2019t make you a bad person in and of itself, but the way you\u2019re handling it in the comments and the way you said you handled it in the original post, DOES make you seem like a bad person. \n\nALSO!!! SHE DIDNT FUCKING SAY YOU WERE A BAD PERSON. you told YOURSELF that. \u201cit made me feel like i was a bad person.\u201d guess what!! making jokes like that does make you a bad person.", "Being sorry doesn't absolve you of consequences. Granny would be well within her rights to reprimand the thief and be upset with him even if he apologizes. If someone kills someone else, is everything forgiven when they apologize? No. And I can already hear you saying that insulting someone isnt the same as killing someone. Of course it isn't, but it illustrates the point that being sorry doesn't absolve you of consequences. Learn from this and do better in the future.", "Your step mother, deeply insecure, hates her body, gets called \u201cthe largest THING\u201d inside of a car by her 14 year old step son. You managed to dehumanize her AND point out the thing she\u2019s deeply insecure about (despite it literally happening during CANCER treatment) at the same time. It\u2019s completely normal that she explodes. Is it in good taste? No. Does it suck it happened? Yes. But clearly she has been feeling a lack of respect in the family for a while if she blows up about it randomly (pressure cooker, btw have you previously been disrespectful that you haven\u2019t told us about?). \n\nI don\u2019t know WHY you\u2019re so determined to have someone say your step mom was an AH too. But you need to stay in ur lane and focus on yourself. You dehumanized your step mother, you also managed to insult the thing that happened as a result of being cancer free (tell me, would you make fun of someone\u2019s scar if they were operated on to remove a cancerous tumor? No? then why would you say this). \n\nAlso, the fact that you impulsively said \u201cmy step mom\u201d reflects a lot about your internal process. \n\nYou need to buck up. Take responsibility. Stop asking for pity points in the comments (but she did something bad too \ud83d\udc49\ud83d\udc48\ud83e\udd7a). Reflect on what type of person you\u2019re growing up to be. Think about why you found it so easy to call your step mom a \u201cthing\u201d and make fun of her weight. Stop trying to pin any of the blame on her. If you don\u2019t think you can do that, and you\u2019d prefer to keep arguing in the comments to try to defend yourself (it\u2019s not working, it makes you seem worse), then think about what type of person that makes you.", "Buddy, you asked if you were TA not her. You both will move on from it. Yes, it sucks that this happened but it will be a good learning exp and you all will move on.", "Why do you so badly need someone to say your stepmom did something wrong? She reacted to a situation YOU caused. YOU.", "if you want to discuss that go somewhere else. stop trying to deflect onto another problem!!! you CLEARLY don\u2019t actually believe you\u2019re TA at all, or you wouldn\u2019t be bringing stupid stuff like this up. you\u2019re trying to continue to pin the blame on your step mom to alleviate the guilt you (rightfully) feel.", "So you're arguing she shouldn't have called you sexist while also admitting that she experienced sexism? If it looks like a duck, walks like a duck, and quacks like a duck....", "You came her to ask, months after the fact, if you are TA for what you did. Pretty mush everyone is saying that you are. Since your first response to a comment it has become evident that your question is not sincere really and you came here for a pity party really. To see if big bad stepmom was wrong for making you feel bad for what you did. She was literally minding her business and you insulted her for no reason, and now you have spent the past few months feeling so bad about yourself that apparently you have broken down crying randomly throughout the house. \n\nYou are a child and have a lot of growing to do. Take what people are saying here to heart and work on how, going forward you will deal with others. Learn from your mistakes and move on. And be lucky that you seem to actually have a decent stepmom. Most people have horror stories after interactions like this. Stop trying to make this bigger than it is.", "Calling you sexist isn't treating you like sh*t. It's calling you out for how you were acting. Making fun of a person's weight makes YTA. You started it, you hurt her,  you're in the wrong. Stop pretending like the word \"sexist\" is a curse word. It accurately describes you.", "You have to understand, you don\u2019t need to explicitly mention her gender to be sexist. It\u2019s likely that she\u2019s saying she is unfairly disadvantaged and judged for being overweight in a way that men are not. She might feel that from you. You should take an accounting of your behavior. Do you think that overweight men are treated harshly as overweight women? Do you think that women are judged more unfairly based on their appearance? Do you make jokes about overweight men in the same way that you do her? I don\u2019t know the answers to these questions, but her position is not crazy. At 14, you should be thinking about this.", "Lol kid. Sexism isnt confined to people saying \"you are a woman so i hate you/women are dumb\"\n\nYoure 14 not 4.", "\\*Wasn't\\*", "I have apologized. As of now I've accepted that I was wrong to call her that but what she said would fall under the term sexism. In her explaining how she had experienced sexism she had stated that all men are sexist. By saying this she was assuming that no matter how you were raised or how you acted, if you were male then you were sexist. This is, by definition, sexism.", "I'm talking about the 8 and 9 year olds that were in the truck", "I literally heard a group of girls go into detail as to why a dude is ugly purely because he was fat. He's a nice guy who's never bothered anyone. They took his picture to laugh at it. Get this, one of the girls wasn't the skinniest herself. Am  I going to make fun of her, no, do I want to, a little, but I would gain nothing.", "Can I ask what your end game is with this AITA post? You asked, people answered (pretty unanimously), but you seem like you just want to defend yourself. Accept the judgment and learn from it.", "If you think that there's ever a point you can make that's so logical that you can un-hurt your feelings and be in the right without examining your own feelings and motivations, you're going to lead a very angry lonely life.", "You need to get off reddit and really spend some time learning about sexism, ageism, the patriarchy, fat phobia\u2026I could go on. You have a lot of learning to do.", "Reflect on that. She is raising you and your siblings. Your parents probably think they are good parents. Yet, here you are making these types of jokes at her expense. Seems to me based on that, her argument is sound.", "Have you ever said or done something out of anger that you didn\u2019t mean?", "Bullshit you absolutely were not.   All you care about is yourself.  That\u2019s why you are having such a glorious pity-party with yourself.   Asshole.  \n\nYTA", "Its quite clear that you triggered her to begin with.  You can't poke a bees nest and expect no collateral damage", "there was also a 5 year old but she didn't say anything about her cause she was a girl", "Yeah, I'm calling bullshit.\n\nYou got called out and now you're trying to make up all these scenarios to figure out what it takes to flip the vote in your favor. (\"But she called everyone sexist\", \"She compared it to the n-word\", \"I saw these girls do stuff\", etc.)\n\nYou're either a troll who's incredibly bored (not to mention boring, I mean fat jokes? Really? How original), or you're a brat who follows the narcissist's prayer to a T, because god forbid you had to take full responsibility for anything without dragging *someone* down with you.", "\u2026 and that makes what you did ok???", "That's not what was asked. What was asked is would YOU make the same joke about a man, like your dad. Girls and grown women can be awful towards men and that's not ok.

You're young, use this as a learning experience to become a better young man.", "Understood, if I'm pissed off don't be an adult and talk it out, get pissed at everyone around me ad talk about how my life is worse", "She didn't say anything about the 5 year old because the 5 year old wasn't making jokes about her weight. That was you.", "None of this matters though. The joke you made makes you TA. If you are sorry why are you making so many excuses and trying to make her look bad?", "Why do I have the feeling you listen to Andrew Tate?", "This was today"]}
