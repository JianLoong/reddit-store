She had made it clear that she is insecure about her weight and doesn't like talking about it due to me and her kids commonly (mostly on accident) making jokes about her weight).\n\n I (14m) was on a drive back from my step grandma's house. We had been in the car for a couple minutes so we decided to play I-spy. My step-brother (7m) had said he spied the biggest thing in the truck so I impulsively said my step-moms name for a quick laugh but my mom didn't like the joke (fair enough). For the next couple of minutes she doesn't say anything (that's fair). Eventually my Dad (37m, I know the age gap is kinda weird)  had asked her a question. This caused her to throw a fit about how no one in the family respected her and how her life had been worse because misogynistic men had disregarded her due to her oversized body. I obviously felt bad but I have a problem where whenever I feel sad I shut down as a coping mechanism so talking to her was very hard for me to do in the situation. \n\nEventually she had calmed down and talked to me normally about how she didn't like people making fun of her in that way (fair enough) but that wasn't the problem. When she had talked about how all her life she had been put down by sexist men it made me feel like I was a bad person for making these jokes. Eventually we had gotten to her ex's house to drop off her kids so it was me alone in dads truck. I started to cry, hard as I am a very sensitive kid. Thoughts kept rushing through my head about how I was a misogynist and how i was an awful person. \n\nA couple minutes later my dad came back and asked me what was wrong. I was in a very bad state so I kept saying \"I didn't want to talk\" and \"Talking would only make things worse\" till my step mom arrived. My dad stepped out of the truck and asked her to talk to me as I was not talking very well to him. She got in the truck and tried to talk to me but I thought if I talked it would make things worse so I just kept saying I didn't want to talk about it. Eventually we got home and I rushed upstairs to my room where for the next day or two I would cry on and off and for the past couple of weeks I've had a feeling that I'm not a good person so I would like honest feedback just to know if I was in the wrong on this.

You've long known of her struggles with her weight, you knew she was sensitive about it, and you went there anyway.\n\nThat said, let's draw a distinction between guilt and shame.  Guilt is feeling bad over what you've done.  It's rooted in behavior.  It's the natural consequence of poor decisions.  If I do something bad to another person, I *should* feel guilty.  I'd argue that guilt is a good thing, because it can get you to change.  Consider that there are people who feel no guilt over their poor behavior: they're called psychopaths, and an entire body of psychology has grown out of the study of such individuals.\n\nOn the other hand, there's shame, which is feeling bad over who you are.  Unlike guilt, shame is rooted in identity.  Whereas guilt says, \"I did a bad thing,\" shame says, \"I am a bad person.\"  And shame is indescribably toxic.  It says, \"I'm a screw-up, I'm a fundamentally bad person, nobody would love me if they really knew me,\" et cetera ad nauseum add your preferred flavor of self-hatred here.\n\nIt sounds like you've made the jump from guilt to shaming yourself pretty quickly.

BUT. And this is a Big But. Having one or many of those characteristics does NOT automatically make you a bad person. Sure, you made an insensitive joke. But you also had compassion afterward for the person who was hurt by your joke.

That capacity you have for self-reflection is absolutely crucial, especially because of these negative messages society wants to teach us.

You\u2019re not a bad person. (Yet.)\n\nYour replies to commenters here seem to hinge on the argument that while you did a bad thing, she called you sexist, which made you feel like a bad person, and that makes her worse than you. \n\nThis is a very common misunderstanding that many people, including plenty of adults, make all the time. People hear, \u201cYou\u2019re being sexist/racist/prejudiced/etc,\u201d and their immediate response is usually something like, \u201cThat can\u2019t be true! I\u2019m not a bad person!\u201d We\u2019ve all unconsciously learned to associate sexism, racism, etc. with the idea of badness. But it doesn\u2019t actually have to mean that you have an irredeemably bad personality. And it usually doesn\u2019t mean that, unless you keep doubling down, get defensive, and refuse to listen. \n\nWhen someone calls you sexist, they usually intend to call out your behavior, not your entire personality. They\u2019re not trying to insult you in retaliation for the bad thing you did. They\u2019re pointing out that you did a bad thing, are inviting you to reflect on your behavior, and giving you the opportunity to apologize. That is, you might say, \u201cHey, I\u2019m sorry, I didn\u2019t realize it, but that was a really sexist way for me to treat you. Now that I see it, I won\u2019t do it again. Thanks for letting me know.\u201d\n\nSo the fact that you felt bad about yourself as a person is a misunderstanding of what your stepmother was saying to you. Yes, your feelings were hurt, but that was through your own incorrect interpretation. \n\nYou don\u2019t have to feel like a bad person \u2014 yet. You might feel guilty, and guilt is a very good feeling, actually. Guilt is unpleasant to experience, but it happens when we look at our actions and realize that they don\u2019t line up with our morality and our idea of how we want to be in the world. Guilt gives us an opportunity to recognize that we didn\u2019t like our own actions and we can make a decision to choose to behave differently in the future. \n\nNow, if someone continuously and habitually behaves badly, without empathy for others, then yeah, they\u2019re probably a bad person. Individual behaviors are one thing. Personality is made up of a series of habits and worldviews that fit a person\u2019s core identity and are resistant to change. You haven\u2019t made sexism part of your personality, I hope, and so you don\u2019t have to worry about this particular sexist behavior meaning that your whole personality is rotten. \n\nJust like in this community, when we say YTA, we (usually) mean that the person behaved badly, not necessarily that their entire personality is irredeemable. (Although sometimes that\u2019s also the case.) Were you the asshole in this situation? Yes, absolutely. You made a joke at the expense of a vulnerable person, especially having already known how bad it made you feel to be made fun of for your own weight. \n\nDoes that mean that we believe you\u2019re going to be an asshole for the rest of your life? Absolutely not. Or at least, I don\u2019t believe that. I believe you have the capacity to step outside of your own hurt feelings, acknowledge that it was your own actions that caused harm to both your stepmother and yourself. And now you have the opportunity to decide NOT to do that again, and to practice behaving kindly and with empathy as often as you can. Then, instead of worrying about not being a bad person, you get to actively work on being a good person from now on.", "Yta. It was insensitive as heck. You say your sensitive and don\u2019t understand how that could hurt her feelings? That was incredibly rude. Sensitive people are typically more aware of the effects words have in others because they are more affected by words people say in them.
