She had made it clear that she is insecure about her weight and doesn't like talking about it due to me and her kids commonly (mostly on accident) making jokes about her weight).\n\n I (14m) was on a drive back from my step grandma's house. We had been in the car for a couple minutes so we decided to play I-spy. My step-brother (7m) had said he spied the biggest thing in the truck so I impulsively said my step-moms name for a quick laugh but my mom didn't like the joke (fair enough). For the next couple of minutes she doesn't say anything (that's fair). Eventually my Dad (37m, I know the age gap is kinda weird)  had asked her a question. This caused her to throw a fit about how no one in the family respected her and how her life had been worse because misogynistic men had disregarded her due to her oversized body. I obviously felt bad but I have a problem where whenever I feel sad I shut down as a coping mechanism so talking to her was very hard for me to do in the situation. \n\nEventually she had calmed down and talked to me normally about how she didn't like people making fun of her in that way (fair enough) but that wasn't the problem. When she had talked about how all her life she had been put down by sexist men it made me feel like I was a bad person for making these jokes. Eventually we had gotten to her ex's house to drop off her kids so it was me alone in dads truck. I started to cry, hard as I am a very sensitive kid. Thoughts kept rushing through my head about how I was a misogynist and how i was an awful person. \n\nA couple minutes later my dad came back and asked me what was wrong. I was in a very bad state so I kept saying \"I didn't want to talk\" and \"Talking would only make things worse\" till my step mom arrived. My dad stepped out of the truck and asked her to talk to me as I was not talking very well to him. She got in the truck and tried to talk to me but I thought if I talked it would make things worse so I just kept saying I didn't want to talk about it. Eventually we got home and I rushed upstairs to my room where for the next day or two I would cry on and off and for the past couple of weeks I've had a feeling that I'm not a good person so I would like honest feedback just to know if I was in the wrong on this.

You've long known of her struggles with her weight, you knew she was sensitive about it, and you went there anyway.\n\nThat said, let's draw a distinction between guilt and shame.  Guilt is feeling bad over what you've done.  It's rooted in behavior.  It's the natural consequence of poor decisions.  If I do something bad to another person, I *should* feel guilty.  I'd argue that guilt is a good thing, because it can get you to change.  Consider that there are people who feel no guilt over their poor behavior: they're called psychopaths, and an entire body of psychology has grown out of the study of such individuals.\n\nOn the other hand, there's shame, which is feeling bad over who you are.  Unlike guilt, shame is rooted in identity.  Whereas guilt says, \"I did a bad thing,\" shame says, \"I am a bad person.\"  And shame is indescribably toxic.  It says, \"I'm a screw-up, I'm a fundamentally bad person, nobody would love me if they really knew me,\" et cetera ad nauseum add your preferred flavor of self-hatred here.\n\nIt sounds like you've made the jump from guilt to shaming yourself pretty quickly.

You're not the victim here, Skippy, she is. Did you give her the apology she deserves or do you somehow think she should apologize for letting you know you were out of line?", "YTA. But good news! You\u2019re not a bad person. (Yet.)\n\nYour replies to commenters here seem to hinge on the argument that while you did a bad thing, she called you sexist, which made you feel like a bad person, and that makes her worse than you. \n\nThis is a very common misunderstanding that many people, including plenty of adults, make all the time. People hear, \u201cYou\u2019re being sexist/racist/prejudiced/etc,\u201d and their immediate response is usually something like, \u201cThat can\u2019t be true! I\u2019m not a bad person!\u201d We\u2019ve all unconsciously learned to associate sexism, racism, etc. with the idea of badness. But it doesn\u2019t actually have to mean that you have an irredeemably bad personality. And it usually doesn\u2019t mean that, unless you keep doubling down, get defensive, and refuse to listen. \n\nWhen someone calls you sexist, they usually intend to call out your behavior, not your entire personality. They\u2019re not trying to insult you in retaliation for the bad thing you did. They\u2019re pointing out that you did a bad thing, are inviting you to reflect on your behavior, and giving you the opportunity to apologize. That is, you might say, \u201cHey, I\u2019m sorry, I didn\u2019t realize it, but that was a really sexist way for me to treat you. Now that I see it, I won\u2019t do it again. Thanks for letting me know.\u201d\n\nSo the fact that you felt bad about yourself as a person is a misunderstanding of what your stepmother was saying to you. Yes, your feelings were hurt, but that was through your own incorrect interpretation. \n\nYou don\u2019t have to feel like a bad person \u2014 yet. You might feel guilty, and guilt is a very good feeling, actually. Guilt is unpleasant to experience, but it happens when we look at our actions and realize that they don\u2019t line up with our morality and our idea of how we want to be in the world. Guilt gives us an opportunity to recognize that we didn\u2019t like our own actions and we can make a decision to choose to behave differently in the future. \n\nNow, if someone continuously and habitually behaves badly, without empathy for others, then yeah, they\u2019re probably a bad person. Individual behaviors are one thing. Personality is made up of a series of habits and worldviews that fit a person\u2019s core identity and are resistant to change. You haven\u2019t made sexism part of your personality, I hope, and so you don\u2019t have to worry about this particular sexist behavior meaning that your whole personality is rotten. \n\nJust like in this community, when we say YTA, we (usually) mean that the person behaved badly, not necessarily that their entire personality is irredeemable. (Although sometimes that\u2019s also the case.) Were you the asshole in this situation? Yes, absolutely. You made a joke at the expense of a vulnerable person, especially having already known how bad it made you feel to be made fun of for your own weight. \n\nDoes that mean that we believe you\u2019re going to be an asshole for the rest of your life? Absolutely not. Or at least, I don\u2019t believe that. I believe you have the capacity to step outside of your own hurt feelings, acknowledge that it was your own actions that caused harm to both your stepmother and yourself. And now you have the opportunity to decide NOT to do that again, and to practice behaving kindly and with empathy as often as you can. Then, instead of worrying about not being a bad person, you get to actively work on being a good person from now on.", "Yta. It was insensitive as heck. You say your sensitive and don\u2019t understand how that could hurt her feelings? That was incredibly rude. Sensitive people are typically more aware of the effects words have in others because they are more affected by words people say in them.

Apologizing does not just erase the harm you caused, especially when it's a fake apology seeing as you keep insulting her. \"I'm sorry\" is not a get out of jail free card. If you're actually sorry, you'll stop trying to act like a victim and you'll stop \"accidentally\" insulting her size.", "YTA all day", "You know what you did wrong. A joke is when everyone laughs. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nYTA.", "YTA in this situation. You explained that you had made the joke multiple times before, and that she had told you how it hurt her.   \n\n\nListen. Being told you've done something hurtful, that you're wrong, that your action was sexist and misogynistic, it is uncomfortable. Being told you've behaved like an AH is uncomfortable. When something is so intensely uncomfortable, our body may react in many ways, like shutting down or crying really hard. You're young and don't have a ton of experience with this kind of thing; you're not a bad person for reacting the way many, many people react by shutting down and crying.   \n\n\nAs well, you are not somehow inherently a bad person, a sexist person, or a misogynist. The best advice I can give you that I really would like you to think about is this: there are no 'bad people', only 'bad behaviors'. You are not evil or bad. The joke you made, however, was bad. It was cruel, and you knew that it would be hurtful. Now you've discovered that when you make this joke that hurts your stepmom, she will react . From how she explained sexism and misogyny, you now know making these jokes affect how she thinks of you. If you care for her and don't want to hurt her and want her to feel good about you, and if you want to feel good about you, this will be very uncomfortable, sad, and stressful.  \n\n\nThe solution is simple, however.  \n\n\nStep 1: Apologize to your stepmom. Take a moment when you're both calm and not busy, maybe in the car or after dinner for example, and tell her what you know and feel like you have here. You knew you had made these jokes before and it hurt her, and after she explained things you felt so awful you couldn't speak and cried. Apologize for hurting her, tell her you've realize how wrong you were, and promise you will not make any mean jokes about her weight nor listen to them/laugh at them from others. And maybe tell her you care about her/love her/appreciate her, whatever applies.  \n\n\nI'm afraid to say that apologizing can feel really uncomfortable, too. Sometimes, good things are uncomfortable. The best thing you can do to help yourself is be kind to yourself. If you are afraid you won't be able to speak, you could write your apology in a letter and give it to her. But this is really important for her-- but also for you. Apologizing will very likely make you feel so much better and lighter, and less out of control with sadness and guilt.  \n\n\nStep 2: Never make the joke again, nor similar comments. If you slip up and begin to make a joke from habit-- stop when you realize, apologize (to yourself and to who you are with), and go back to other topics. Maybe try pausing longer in conversations before you make a joke, and ask yourself-- is what I am about to say what I really want to say? Is it mean and hurtful, or is it kind and helpful? Is it being negative? Pausing can help you stop before maybe habit or impulse get the wrong words out.  \n\n\nThis is a growing pain, my friend. That you feel so guilty means you have grown into a person who realizes the weight of mean words and now regrets them and their result. This can only be a good thing, and you can move forward from here to stop this bad behavior and leave it behind. Just be kind to others, and to yourself; everyone makes mistakes, especially while  young. Don't let the bad feelings hold you hostage and stop you from doing better. Apologize, and change your behavior.", "You are not a victim here. \n\nYTA. A major AH. I don\u2019t care that you\u2019re 14, you know it was wrong to say that about her.

Just because you did an AH thing doesn\u2019t mean you have to be an AH person overall. That depends on how you handle it going forward. \n\nI wonder if you understand why she called this comment misogynistic? Women receive A LOT of criticism about their physical appearance. There is a lot of messaging in our culture that a woman\u2019s worth is tied to how she looks. Women are taught to worry about their bodies from incredibly young ages and it\u2019s a lot of pressure. It\u2019s not that men can\u2019t or don\u2019t feel insecure about their bodies, but that there\u2019s this universal pressure on women and a history of treating women as objects instead of people that is important context to keep in mind. Repeatedly commenting on a woman\u2019s weight when it is totally irrelevant to anything going on feels misogynistic because it feels like you\u2019re reducing her to just be her weight. And that sucks. Even if you didn\u2019t consciously think that, you are part of a culture and you\u2019ve learned that it\u2019s ok to talk about women this way and now the burden is on you to work to unlearn that. \n\nI\u2019m sorry that you got really upset and overwhelmed in the moment. But that\u2019s your issue to deal with and to figure out why you felt that way. Is it because you felt bad about yourself being portrayed badly? Or because you genuinely hate the idea of hurting your stepmom? Hopefully you feel at least partly bad for the second reason. And if that\u2019s the case, all you can do now is try and do better.

Even at that age, where I had a learning disability and thus was nonverbal at that age, I knew that my actions impacted others, and I felt good by making others happy and doing good things. The doctors said I was slow and probably wouldn't ever learn how to read, write, or speak (haha, look where I am now), as well as potentially having issues with understanding nonverbal language and understanding others. I still have a tiny bit of difficulty with nonverbal cues or implied knowledge, but I know not to say things that hurt people's feelings, BECAUSE IT HURTS THEIR FEELINGS, and purposely saying those things after having the knowledge that it hurts people makes me a bad person, as I would be weaponizing their insecurities against them. If I did these things, I would not be allowed to call myself a victim because I decided to hurt someone else's feelings, or, as OP's case most likely is, have zero regards for other people, as OP lives in a place where the world revolves around him, and everyone else is a bunch of npc's who do not truly exist or have feelings.", "ALL of this", ">OP knew about the reason why she is overweight \n\nAnd also knew she didn't like comments about her weight, which makes him a super-sized AH.", "\"It hurts me so much being an asshole, I just shut down and cry\"  \nWouldn't it be easier to just not be an asshole?", "Yes, very manipulative.

I tell my kids it's good they feel upset that they hurt someone. It's a lesson, if you don't want to feel that guilt eat away at you, don't treat others that way.

Big fan of therapy", "I'm cutting him some slack based on being 14 as in, maybe he'll grow out of this behaviour and not be an AH as an adult but yeah, it's monumentally obtuse to not see that joking about the very thing people asked you not to joke about because it hurts them, is AH behaviour. And making yourself the victim in that, crying and refusing to use your words, when it sounds like the SM wasn't even angry with him, just hurt and trying to explain why he shouldn't keep doing it is so manipulative."]}
