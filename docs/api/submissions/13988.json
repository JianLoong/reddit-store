It was mom & dad's decision; but because of how much the family loved my brother, extended family decided to do the same and stand in agreement with this decision.\n\n\nMy husband would refuse to follow this decision, and kept celebrating his birthday. Me and the family didn't say a thing about it since he's not blood family. But when I first got pregnant, the argument about celebrating our daughter's birthdays occured. My family adviced me to just not celebrate her birthday since she's a baby and won't even remember anyway. I agreed but my husband threw a fit and insisted that we celebrate our daughter's 1st birthday. I caved in eventually but told him we'd have a small, secret celebration so that my family wouldn't find out. He agreed.\n\nThe next day, I got a call from mom and she was so upset saying that my word meant nothing and that I have no respect for my brother's memory nor the family. I asked what she meant and she told me she saw the birthday party pics my husband posted on social media. I was to shocked to even argue. I hung up and went straight to my husband to confront him about it. He got defensive and said that he didn't need my permission to post pics, and that he wanted to show his family the birthday celebration pics since I \"insisted\" we have a small, secret party and \"exclude\" them. I explained to him how this made me look bad and a liar to my family but he said \"they can get over it\" and called my mom \"snooby\". I blew up at him and we had a huge fight about it. He started sulking later and said I ruined the memory of our daughter's first birthday for him and \"verbally abused\" him with how I lashed out. But I solely did it out of frusrtation knowing that what happened caused a massive problem between me and family.\n\n\nNow he's expecting an apology from me.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1680631223, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12br226/aita_for_blowing_up_at_my_husband_for_sharing/", "score": 660, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

This is out of control. That is an insane thing to agree to concerning people who weren't even BORN at the time. Your children and husband did not consent to this.\n\nIt honestly sounds like your family might need some therapy all around. It is sad someone died but the living should not have to pay a price for it every year. Birthdays are about celebrating the LIFE of the person BORN THAT DAY, not about the death of a person born a different day.\n\nYou do look bad, and you are a liar. You should have stood up and said \"We celebrating the life of my daughter\" to your family. Go apologize to your husband.", "YTA SO HARD \ud83d\ude02 so any kids you have are never ever allowed birthdays because your brother died? Your family all need counselling.", "YTA, and so is your birth family. Whole generations should not be made to mourn someone they've never seen, and neither should it be binding on the decedent's brother-in-law or niece.\n\nI'd suggest you tell your family you're finally done mourning your brother.\n\nYour daughter is entitled to have her birthdays celebrated. I can just picture in 5 years the lovely conversation you'll have: \"I know your schoolmates have birthday parties, birthday cakes, and birthday gifts, and you can't have one. That's because your uncle's dead.\" Jesus Christ on a Triscuit!\n\nIt's time to stop the madness.", "YTA. Your family is a bunch of AHs too. Instead of grief counseling they took away birthdays for everyone. That\u2019s BS. \n\nYour daughter deserves to be celebrated and your family -and you- need to deal with it.", "[removed]", "YTA \n\nYour whole family is. Refusing to celebrate your daughter's birthday because your brother died is ridiculous. Celebrate the living, your daughter is the one that matters here. Your brother is beyond caring.", "YTA.\n\nYour brothers memory is being kept alive by conflict and resentment. Is that really what he might have wanted? That his remaining family would never again celebrate a birthday, and that they would shame people for doing so?\n\nI would be asking Zeus to loan me some lightning bolts if I were sitting up on the clouds and watching this unfold.\n\nI'm sure the memory is painful for all of you, but insisting that nobody in your family ever celebrates birthdays again is deranged. Cultures around the globe have been celebrating birthdays for millennia.\n\nAnd now you're being shitty to your husband who didn't really do anything wrong, other than not being willing to capitulate to insane demands from his in laws.", "Yta - and yes, you should apologize. This \"tradition\" is ridiculous. What's going to happen when she's 5? Why after all that time would it suddenly be okay to celebrate birthdays again? Frankly, I wouldn't have had a child with you in the first place but since he did... you can tell your family to get over it, or you can expect for your daughter to spend her birthday without you.", "YTA. This is incredibly unhealthy and your entire family needs professional help.", "YTA\n\nYou can't just unilaterally decide your kids don't get birthdays if your husband doesn't agree. He doesn't agree.\n\nDraw boundaries with your family. They can do what they want, it doesn't obligate your husband to deprive his own child of celebrating birthdays.", "YTA\n\nGrief is one thing, but this is control. What is wrong with your family and why are you humoring it? I'm disgusted.", "YTA\n\nYou want to deprive your daughter of birthday celebrations her entire life? How is that healthy? Maybe your family would have benefited from grief counseling and still would. But if your husband wants to celebrate his child, he should be able to. Your parents should not affect how you celebrate your child being born. You are putting your parents views above your child.\n\nHow is stopping birthday celebrations permanently honoring your brother's memory?", "YTA, along with your entire birth family. Your husband has every right to celebrate his daughter\u2019s birthday, and if you or your weird relatives choose not to participate, that\u2019s on you.

She\u2019ll grow up completely resenting your entire side of her family.", "Your family's phobia of birthdays does not supersede your husband's and his family's ability to have a birthday party for HIS kid.

Love to the family.", "YTA\n\nThis whole request is ridiculous and is obviously unfair to the daughter, and you're surprised your husband (the father of said daughter) would make a big stink over this? You can't expect to hide this forever.", "YTA - And you family is made up of A H's.  They have codified PTSD and expect the world to dance to their tune.\n\nGuess what, the death rate is 100%!  Everyone dies on one of 365 days of the year.  To decide that no one should EVER celebrate a birthday because a person died on their birthday DEFAMES their memory!

It doesn\u2019t even matter if the one year old will even remember it. \n\nI am sorry that your family has a thing about birthdays. That sucks for them. But their thing cannot extend to other people that are just going about their normal lives. I understand your husbands frustration with your parents.", "Your brother didn't want your family to stop celebrating birthdays because of him. \n\nHe wants you all to carry on with life and to be happy and celebrate.", "Yta, your family is the ah. \n\nWas your brother really the type of person who would want no children to ever have a birthday again because he died on his? \n\nI don\u2019t understand how this honors a loved one\u2019s death at all. Life goes on. Babies keep being born, the sun stills rises, and people are still going to keep eating cake and getting balloons for their birthday. Especially for an innocent baby. \n\nYour husband is right, and your family needs grief counseling and maybe therapy.", "YTA and your family is abusive.\nGrief is one thing, but to prevent others from celebrating life is gross and unnecessarily unpleasant.\nSorry for your loss, that\u2019s tragic. Ask yourself what your brother would think of this. Would he want you all bickering and hurting each other \u201cout of respect\u201d for him?", "YTA, birthdays is all about celebrating the life people have loved. Why are you forcing what your family thinks in your marriage and on your child? \n\nIf they don't want to celebrate their birthdays then fine but your child deserves to at least celebrate with the family around him and your husband side does deserve to be part of it if they did nothing wrong. It your marriage and your family not your mother's not your father. Don't let them tell you what to do and cave. This not grieving and truthfully not healthy. Life should be celebrated because you don't know how long someone has on this world and you will regret it if you don't.", "YTA. I have a lot of sympathy for those grappling with grief but this 'tradition' is not OK. Better to rip the bandaid off now, it's not like you planned to deny your daughter birthday celebrations her entire life anyway. Right?", "YTA and your family is full of nuts who are trying to force their grief on other people, not ok. I feel bad for the children of your family.", "YTA denying every single human on earth a birthday celebration won't bring your brother back or lessen the pain. It's unhinged to stop celebrating all birthdays and insane to expect others to comply to your wackadoodle birthday ban. I hope your husband divorces you and keeps your poor baby away from the toxic influences of your psychologically damaged family.", "YTA. A vast majority of people want to celebrate their birthday and while your family may choose not to, they shouldn\u2019t be able to dictate everyone else\u2019s celebration of their own birthday or their kids birthdays. That is THEIR CHOICE that you have agreed to follow for yourself. This is so utterly strange that you would get upset or deny your husband celebrating the one year anniversary of his child\u2019s birth.", "I guarantee if your brother has a say in this he wouldn't want his niece to not get a party just because your family needs therapy. YTA.", "YTA and a big one at that\n\nNo she won't remember her birthday, but why should your husband and his family be denied a right to celebrate because your family has issues.\n\nYou need to grow a set and tell your family, that although it's sad your brother died on his birthday that is absolutely no reason you can't rejoice in the birth and celebrate for your child (or future children).", "It is absurd that your parents grief has allowed them to hijack joy from so many other people\u2019s celebrations. Your husband is not the asshole. Is your child is going to get shamed by your family for attending kids birthdays in her class when she\u2019s older? Where does it end? \n\nShould never have been allowed to be a \u201crule\u201d in the first place and someone with sense should\u2019ve pushed back but everyone was so deep in their grief it overrode sense.\n\nBirthdays are for people to decide how they want to celebrate for themselves, a celebration of THAT person is not disrespectful to ANYONE.", "YTA. This is incredibly weird.\n\nI mean, what happens when your kid gets older and gets invited to a birthday party? Are you gonna disallow it because of an uncle they have never even met? Or are you gonna let them go, only for the kids to hear how \"Little Longjumping\\_Peach597 isn't allowed to have a birthday party because her uncle died before she was born.\"\n\nAs for posting the picture, your husband is allowed to not be controlled by your parents. You're very lucky he chooses to stay with you, because if this were me, divorce papers would be on the table the next morning and I would definitely ask the courts to get full custody.\n\nSeriously. You and your entire family need therapy, this is not normal or healthy.", "YTA! Nobody can celebrate bday ever again? You need to get your family in line. Why should your kid no experience bday parties? Also another family is involved and they can\u2019t celebrate either?", "YTA this whole situation is unhealthy and going to be toxic for your child. Your husband and certainly your child have every right to enjoy and celebrate birthdays. I'm sorry your parents think that in some way banning birthdays is somehow honoring your brother but it's not. I'm almost tempted to say E S H because your husband should have been open with you about what he was doing but I can't call him an asshole for dealing with it this way", "Yta. It's not reasonable to cancel every birthday for your child. They never get to have one? Ridiculous.", "YTA holy hell.. your poor husband.", "It's insane to expect everyone to stop celebrating their birthdays just because your brother passed away on his. Yes, it's unfortunate and sad. If they want, they can choose to not celebrate their own birthdays, but they don't have the right to dictate what others choose do (or not do) on their own birthdays. It's also extremely offensive and disrespectful to everyone else in their lives They didn't die. Are their lives not worth celebrating once in a while? It's also insane to be accommodating your parents demand by sneaking around, having \"secret\" birthday parties. Your husband was excited and happy to celebrate his daughters first birthday. Let him have that! Let your daughter have that! If your parents want to spend their lives in perpetual mourning of their golden child, let them do that on their own. They have no right to demand it from others. YTA and your parents too.", "You were an asshole to your husband, who seems to very much love your daughter. People celebrate birthdays to celebrate life, cutting out all birthdays forever is literally stopping the celebration of LIFE. WTF ARE YOU GUYS DOING? From an outside perspective your family seems absolutely insane and it seems they've kinda molded you to that. Why not celebrate your dead brothers birthday every year, and everyone elses? Celebrate your brothers life, don't sulk about it until everyone that knew him is dead. Also yes apologies to your husband are 100% in order, he loves you and the family you have created, you should both want to celebrate.", "YTA and your entire family, excluding your husband and daughter, need therapy. Yes, your brother died on his birthday, but guess what, the world doesn't stop turning just because one person died on their birthday and their family didn't get the grief counselling that they BADLY need.", "YTA. You and your family basically outlawed the celebration of birthdays to \u201chonor\u201d your brother. Get off it. I\u2019m siding with your husband. Get some MUCH needed therapy. I hope your hubby throws a huge second and third and fourth birthday party for years to come.", "YTA\n\nYour family's arrangement is unreasonable to impose on anyone else. Your husband shouldn't have to apologize for celebrating his daughter's birthday.", "YTA. It is ok for your parents to decide to stop celebrating birthdays. It is ok for you to stop celebrating your birthday. It is not ok for you or your parents to force others to do or not do anything.", "YTA. \n\nYour immediate family is now your husband and child. You need to make memories with them and decisions with your husband WITHOUT the input of your family. His family missed out because your entire family decided no one blood related to them can ever celebrate a birthday again, which is ridiculous. \n\nIt is high time you stand up for your husband and child and tell your family that they are not required to celebrate your child but what you do with your husband, child and his extended family is none of their business.", "Yta, what a dumb thing. Do you think your brother wouldnt want his niece to EVER have a birthday just because he died??? Let me tell you, I would he so pissed if I died and my family didnt have a birthday for my niece because of it.

It's unfortunate you lost your brother and I'm sorry about that. But celebrations are for the living. If a person or a group of people choose not to celebrate, that's their choice.

Your daughter's birthday should be a happy day.", "YTA. I understand and empathize that losing your brother was a traumatic experience for you and your family, but imposing and transmitting that trauma to your husband and then your child is super unhealthy for them.", "YTA, your daughter *never* gets to have a birthday celebration because of a family member she will never know. How is that fair to her?  You're just going to have to accept that her birthday is an important day, how can you not understand that?", "I think your extended family needs therapy. Their reaction to stop celebrating all birthdays because they lost a loved one on the person's birthday is nothing short of bizarre, and demanding that people marrying into the family adhere to it seems cult-like.\n\nPeople generally celebrate milestones, such as birthdays, and it is normal for your husband to want to celebrate your child's first birthday and to share this celebration with his family since you wouldn't let them attend in person. Because that is normal behavior. Your family's banning of birthdays is not normal behavior.\n\nYTA for going along with this bizarre ritual (well, lack of ritual) your family has and for blowing up at your husband about not falling in line with it.", "The first problem is the agreement to never celebrate birthdays. While I understand the thought and that the hurt of a child doing never goes away, it's unrealistic to not celebrate children's birthdays, especially young children.\n\nThe second problem is to assume no IL would have a problem with it for their own children. Would that be a deal breaker for a marriage/relationship? \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\n\nThe third problem is a grandparent who would not allow a celebration of their grandchild's birthday. Not want to be posey if it? OK. But outright be upset about it? Kidding, right...?\n\nThe fourth problem is a husband who knows all this and - after rightfully following more realistic expectations and celebrating his daughters first birthday - put pictures online. He had to have some idea of what was coming.\n\nAll around it's a screwed up situation. A lot of AH awards to be handed out here.\n\nIn the end though, celebrate those kids birthdays. Keep it from the grands if needed, but don't screw up the next generation to salve an older one.", "YTA - You should know better enough to know that you, nor your family have any right to revoke something as special as birthdays from anybody, especially children.\n\nSure, your daughter won\u2019t remember her 1st birthday but that does not mean that she won\u2019t get the opportunity of feeling the joy of being celebrated by those she loves most on her special day, shame on your family for trying to take that from her and shame on you for letting them AND blowing up at seemingly the only person that wanted her to experience that for the first time. You owe your husband an apology for trying to make it seem like he\u2019s the bad guy for wanting to celebrate his daughters birthday instead of treating it like a dirty secret. \n\nAsk yourself if this is something your brother would have condoned or wanted. I understand the grief of losing someone very dear to your heart, but the way your family handles it isn\u2019t healthy at all, try getting them to consider going to therapy or grief counseling.\n\nEdit: retracted the first sentence.", "That's beyond unreasonable and downright ridiculous. Your poor daughter and I wouldn't be surprised if this might be a dealbreaker for your husband if her 2nd birthday goes the same way. YTA.", "YTA, this is a super unhealthy way of dealing with trauma. And on top of it you are allowing your parents how to decide to raise your own children. Insane.", "YTA. You only get one life, and you certainly are doing a great job at filling the memory book with bad times. You probably didn't even ask your husband about how he felt about all of this.  Typical.", "Yep, YTA - and so is your family.  Your family isn't the AH for deciding to not celebrate their own birthdays, but they are for demanding that no one else gets to celebrate theirs, either.  And you are for enabling their behavior and applying it to people who aren't part of the pact.  Also, get ready for 18 years of tears and a lifetime of resentment from your child, who never got to celebrate their birthday with loved ones because someone they never met, who died years before they were born, died on their own birth date.  You can share those tear-filled birthday pictures.  They'll be awful - but at least your Mommy won't be mad.  That's far more important than your child getting to be a child.", "YTA. And your whole family needs therapy, this is not healthy", "YTA! Let me get this straight. Because your brother died on his birthday no one in the family is not allowed to celebrate their birthday ever again. This includes all generations from both sides? So technically you will expect your grandkids to never celebrate their bdays? That's ludicrous!\n\nAnd I get the impression you would prefer your husband not to celebrate his bday either. \n\nWhat would your brother think? If it was me I'd be pissed if they stopped celebrating anything cause I died. \n\nYall need therapy!", "YTA\n\nLet your family do what they as adults having gone through this tragedy do. Kids should get birthdays. Your husband should have a birthday. He should be able to share pictures of his child he loves.

Almost like they don't even want to remember it.", "YTA - I say that with all the sympathy in the world as I know how hard it is to lose a sibling, but your family is being unfair.   How many generations of the family are supposed to not celebrate birthdays due to this loss?

I'm sorry for your loss, but your husband can't be held hostage from showing pictures of YOUR FIRST BORN to his family, because your family can't get past this loss. \n\nAre your parents expecting your kid not to celebrate any birthdays he will actually remember? This isn't a religious thing, this is a scenario where your family needs to go to therapy because they are hindering everyone from a simple celebration. Don't be an AH.", "I'm sorry for your loss, but YTA. it really sounds like you and your family need help and counseling concerning the loss of your brother. But never celebrating birthdays will not bring him back or help dull the pain.

OP, I hope you and your family can let yourselves heal, so you can live a healthy, happy life with your husband and your daughter.", "YTA, 100% and you shouldn\u2019t get to final say on birthdays. Your daughter is his daughter as well and you and your parents need counseling. Your daughter has a whole other side of the family that would love to celebrate birthdays with her. Don\u2019t you think that\u2019s unfair for them?", "Gentle YTA please realize this family dynamic is extremely dysfunctional and abnormal. Your husband has a right to post on his own social media and celebrate his child how he wants as long as it is not putting the child or you in danger (and I\u2019m not talking about your family being upset because you had a birthday party). There is no reason to deny your child the right to celebrate their birthday because your family feels some type of way. And that doesn\u2019t mean you didn\u2019t love your brother, whatever they say. That\u2019s on them, and they need therapy. Big time. Why you agreed to no celebrations in the first place should have been your first clue that you and they need professional intervention.", "YTA. Why should your daughter be punished for your brother's death? If your family of origin can't handle birthday celebrations, they don't have to participate, but they do need to understand that it will harm their relationship with her. You, on the other hand, have an obligation to do what's best for your child, so you need to get therapy so that you won't ruin all of her birthdays.", "As someone who lost a sibling, I want to be very very very clear here.\n\nYour entire family needs grief counseling.\n\nYTA for using your trauma to deny your child the joy of birthdays. How callous. This is the kind of B.S. that creates kids who go NC. You\u2019ve got 17 years to fix this, first step is family therapy.", "I am sorry about your brother, and I do believe you are in a tight spot not wanting to upset your parents, however what they and others choose to do should not be the deciding factor for you and your family.  \n\nI do feel YTA for lying. You can throw a party of any size, whatever you and your husband feel is appropriate and you can invite whomever you want, even your family.  If they do not want to celebrate, they can decline the invite.  Hiding the fact that you threw a party is making it like you (who is a grown, married woman with a child) still needs permission from mommy and daddy.", "YTA- I\u2019m sorry about your brother\u2019s passing, but do you really think not celebrating birthdays is the answer? Would he really want that?", "YTA and you should apologize. She is also his daughter. Your family is ridiculous for enforcing a bullshit rule about no birthdays for anyone ever again. And you should have stood up to your mother for your husband.", "YTA. So you won\u2019t have birthdays and celebrate your own child because your parents have grief? They need counseling if that\u2019s how they\u2019re going to behave. You need it if you\u2019re going to act like that. Your child\u2019s life and activities should be fun and celebrate her but you\u2019d rather bow down to your parents than give your child a good and loving life? Stop. I know grief is hard, I do but just because one passes doesn\u2019t mean you stop celebrating the people that are alive. You\u2019re punishing your child for his death. Is that fair? You\u2019re asking your husband to live in your parents grief, is that fair? Stop bending over backwards for mommy and daddy and give your child the life your baby deserves. Your husband should post pictures of your child\u2019s party and events, that\u2019s his child. He has that right. You can do things mommy and daddy don\u2019t like or want, you have your own family, act like it.

To expect the world to stop because of one tragedy is horrific.  If it still bothers your mother she needs counseling.  If you cannot stand up for your children and enforce boundaries you are failing your children.   What are you teaching your children about dealing with grief?  Your husband doesn't owe anyone an explanation for celebrating his own child's birthday.  He actually needs to get his children away from such a toxic environment.  This is not healthy.

Oh and for gods sake let your husband enjoy his child", "ESH except your husband.\n\nIt's totally unreasonable to expect that birthdays in a family NEVER be celebrated again due to a death (even a death on that person's birthday), especially for children born afterwards.  You should have supported your husband in his desire to celebrate your daughter's birthday and not lied/mislead your family about it.\n\nYour poor daughter, you were going to never celebrate or hide her birthday her whole childhood?", "YTA. It is so hard to lose someone especially a young person. But, this is not healthy. You\u2019re expecting your husband to behave the same way as you. This is not healthy. Would your brother want you to stop celebrating everything as a way to honor him? What about when your child is older? She\u2019s never suppose to have a birthday party ever? None of that is reasonable, normal, or healthy. You all need therapy.", "YTA You spoke out of turn agreeing with your family.

You and your whole family sounds like you need grief counseling/any other mental health help that you can get.

Do you honestly not see how delusional you and your family are?", "YTA.\n\nI am sorry for the loss of your brother on his birthday.  But I think your family is carrying the ban on birthday celebrations way too far.  It's not healthy.  It's pretty clear that you all think it's OK to be judgmental about others celebrating their birthdays.

It was mom & dad's decision; but because of how much the family loved my brother, extended family decided to do the same and stand in agreement with this decision.\n\n\nMy husband would refuse to follow this decision, and kept celebrating his birthday. Me and the family didn't say a thing about it since he's not blood family. But when I first got pregnant, the argument about celebrating our daughter's birthdays occured. My family adviced me to just not celebrate her birthday since she's a baby and won't even remember anyway. I agreed but my husband threw a fit and insisted that we celebrate our daughter's 1st birthday. I caved in eventually but told him we'd have a small, secret celebration so that my family wouldn't find out. He agreed.\n\nThe next day, I got a call from mom and she was so upset saying that my word meant nothing and that I have no respect for my brother's memory nor the family. I asked what she meant and she told me she saw the birthday party pics my husband posted on social media. I was to shocked to even argue. I hung up and went straight to my husband to confront him about it. He got defensive and said that he didn't need my permission to post pics, and that he wanted to show his family the birthday celebration pics since I \"insisted\" we have a small, secret party and \"exclude\" them. I explained to him how this made me look bad and a liar to my family but he said \"they can get over it\" and called my mom \"snooby\". I blew up at him and we had a huge fight about it. He started sulking later and said I ruined the memory of our daughter's first birthday for him and \"verbally abused\" him with how I lashed out. But I solely did it out of frusrtation knowing that what happened caused a massive problem between me and family.\n\n\nNow he's expecting an apology from me.\n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "Gentle YTA here, but at least you're not alone in your verdict.  Your family members are too.  It is heartbreaking when a son or brother dies, but the world doesn't end (though it sure feels like it.)  Children are allowed to have birthdays, and adults who won't allow it have weaponized their grief as a way to guarantee everyone around them continues to suffer forevermore.  Your husband's right, and you parents absolutely DO need to get over it, because that's unhealthy for them and cruel to the children and grandchildren.", "Everyone sucks here but your husband the least. So I'm gonna go with YTA.\n\nHe shouldn't have agreed to have a \"secret\" birthday party if he was going to post online about it but the expectations you've created are not fair. I imagine he accepted the deal just so he could stop arguing and have this birthday party. If some members of your family don't want to celebrate **their** own birthday in memory, that's fine, but they cannot ask of everyone in their extended family to do the same.\n\nWhile your kid may not remember the events of her birthday, it's a special day where she probably got more joy than she does on other days. It's a time to spend more time with your family and bond. She may not remember the specifics, but such cultural events in a toddler's life are important. Your husband is also entitled to celebrate this special day. Sorry, but it's your job to stand up to your family and let them know you will be celebrating your child's birthday every year. You understand if it's too painful to attend and respect that.\n\nHow about you use your brother's birthday as a celebration and remembrance of his life instead? You could organize that family reunion to try and make amends with your family.", "YTA. So you want your daughter to never get to celebrate the day she was born because of a dead uncle she never met and had nothing to do with? Wtf that's so selfish. Would your brother be happy knowing that no one celebrates birthdays or gets to have fun after his passing? Why don't you guys use birthdays as a family celebration to appreciate those who are still here instead of viewing it as a \"stain\" on your brothers memory. You all need therapy if you think that's sane or healthy way of dealing with grief.", "YTA. You baby has nothing to do with your brother dying. Not being funny but if something ever happened to either your husband or child (praying it doesnt), you would regret NOT creating those special memories with them.", "YTA and so is your family. I'm sorry for the loss of your brother, I truly am. It's just taking away all birthdays because he passed on his is not healthy. Then extending it the next generation, when will it end? It's time to heal and that does mean having birthdays again and not being ashamed of it. Your family needs to understand that. They don't have to agree with it but for your mom to call you a liar for celebrating your daughter's 1st birthday? Nah, not okay.", "YTA. You and your family need help badly. Why would you ruin your child\u2019s birthday because your family can\u2019t deal with death? Get help for yourself if your parents won\u2019t.", "YTA and your entire family. If I died tragically the very last thing I would ever want my family to do is deprive themselves of events/days that bring them joy in my 'memory'.

You're whole family needs therapy.", "Your brother dying on his 17th birthday is very tragic and I\u2019m sorry that your family had to experience this pain.

I truly think you and your family need therapy.

My judgement is ESH.", "ESH - what your family is doing is super unhealthy. It\u2019s a horrible way to keep your brothers memory alive by denying joy and celebration. However, you\u2019re husband also went back on his agreement with you.

YTA and so is your mom. But and let me make this perfectly clear, YOU are the BIGGEST most MASSIVE FUCKING ASSHOLE in this situation.

What will you say when they ask why they can have one. That they don't deserve one because someone else died? Will you tell them they can't celebrate others birthdays because it makes them hate you ans your family. What happens when that teenager tells you and family he hates who died because of them they ruined something that is supposed to be celebrated. And if you think they won't think, feel, or say things like that then you need to see someone. What will your child think about dad celebrating but not them. Your life does not revolve around your family but your husband and kids.

They could have had a fight about \"being done with his in-laws\" instead of lying to his spouse.", "I thought it was a Great Dane that rode around in a van solving mysteries.", "I thought it was a typo for snoopy, as in she was snooping", "Snooby snooby snoo, pear au jus", "Rikes!", "Ohhh actually that makes even more sense", "I'm going to have that stuck in my head all day, and I'm going to have to explain to my husband why I'm humming it later while cooking. Thanks a lot for that \ud83e\udd23"]}
