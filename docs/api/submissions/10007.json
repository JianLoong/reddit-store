He fell in love with our uncle's parrot when we were young. He always wanted one and when he got a job where he could take care of one he got it.  \n\nDon was neurodivergent. He had trouble connecting with people.  But he loved that bird.  And it seemed to return the affection.  \n\nDon didn't like to travel. Or leave his home. Or do much besides work, play video games, collect Pokemon stuff, and interact with his parrot.  \n\nI, on the other hand, try and get out of town whenever I can. I also use every second of my vacation time and PTO. \n\nDon passed away just after New Year's.  He didn't have a girlfriend, much less a wife. He did have a will and he left me everything. Including Ash his parrot. \n\nI don't want his parrot.  Trust me after listening to my brother talk about African Grey Parrots for the last 20 years I know more about them than anyone normal should.  Including that they can live up to 60 years.  That's would have been great for Don. I on the other hand am not planning on taking care of any human children I have for 60 years.  \n\nI talked to my parents to see if they would take him\n They said their condo doesn't allow pets. I checked with the rest of our family and nobody wanted to make that commitment. \n\nI contacted a local bird rescue but they only take wild raptors. I tried the zoo. They do not accept birds.  I guess there is a chance of diseases or something.  \n\nMy brother loved this bird so I wasn't going to do anything stupid with it. Ash was actually growing on me. I was considering keeping him. Lucky for me and Ash my uncle finally got back to me.  His parrot had died a couple of years ago and since he is in his late forties he didn't adopt a new one.  \n\nI gladly invited him over to see if he liked Ash. He told me that he and his old bird has met Ash. And even been over to Don's house for a playdate before.  \n\nIt was excellent. My uncle knows more about them than my brother did. And now I have that information stuck in my head.  \n\nAsh went to live with my uncle.  I thought it was the perfect solution. Until my mom called to chew me out for imposing a bird on my uncle.  He doesn't make that much money and birds are expensive to take care of I guess. \n\nNot that it was any of her business but my brother left me a nice chunk of change. And an impressive collection of Pokemon stuff. I had already told my uncle that I would be paying for food and vet bills for Ash.  I even volunteered to birdsit him if my uncle needed and I'm on town. I know Don would want that.  \n\nShe still said that it was a bad decision to give her brother the bird. I probably didn't improve our conversation by giggling when she said that. \n\nI honestly think I did right by everyone involved.  But my mom disagrees.  I need someone with no skin in the game to tell me if I'm missing something.\n\nEdit\n\nWhen I said normal I didn't mean neurotypical.

Secondly you have BOTH ensured that the most qualified and loving member of the family will care for Ash and ALSO ensured that your uncle will not have to bear the financial burden but instead your brothers estate will support Ash the way he would have wanted. *That is the best possible outcome*. Parrots NEED companionship. You are unable, and *unwilling* to care for him, but you are honoring your brother the best way you know how. You have made a FABULOUS choice. Your mother's reaction is understandable, she is grieving and probably wanted to be able to visit Ash, she probably had a vision for Ash's care that was very important to her *because her child just died and Ash was clearly the most important aspect of your brothers life outside of you and your parents*. It's ok that you and your parents have different views of the best care for Ash, but unless your mother is ready to step up she needs to respect your decision.", "NTA your uncle is a grown ass man who knows the costs associated with the kind of bird *he's already had*.

Your mom really isn't either, I think she meant well, but may not understand that a bird is better off with someone who truly wants it as part of their life. \n\nI have a friend involved in parrot rescue, and its extremely common unfortunately that one outlives their person. It's rare a family member is willing to even try to care for the bird, so I give you credit for that. The parrot can have a better life with someone who really wants it as a big part of their life though. I'd personally never want one at all, even trying was a huge thing on your part.", "NTA.\n\nYour uncle was interested in Ash, knew Ash before your brother passed away, and was willing to take Ash.

Parrots have *incredibly* high social needs, and IMO it is borderline animal cruelty for people who do not understand/aren't motivated to meet those needs to keep them. You did the right thing by recognizing you weren't equipped to take care of Ash and rehoming him to someone willing and experienced with parrots. Your mom *might* have had a leg to stand on with the financial aspect, but since you have that covered that's not a good argument either. \n\nI think your mom is likely struggling with grief and her brain has latched onto this issue.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

That's really nice.", "NTA\n\nIf your uncle took proper care for his last bird he will do so with Ash as well.", "Unless you had explicitly said to your brother you would care for him after he was gone, then you have done the best thing possible. Pets deserve a home that wants them.", "NTA. Parrots are notoriously difficult to re-home. The fact that you managed it at all is pretty remarkable and you seem to have done a decent job. One thing to consider, do the parents consider the parrot a last link with their kid? Would visiting it regularly help with that?", "You don't want the bird, but did your best to get the bird a good home. Nobody else wanted to bother with it. And you didn't force your uncle to take him, your uncle offered. Seems perfectly reasonable to me, NTA.", "NTA,  you're fine. Mom needs to mind her own business. The arrangements you made is between you and your uncle,  period.", "NTA, and I\u2019m sorry for the loss of your brother. As someone who has a bird, they are a huge commitment and a lot of work although they are also extremely rewarding. You did the right thing looking for someone who knows something about birds to take Ash in, and if your uncle knows birds then he was a good choice. You\u2019ve not imposed on him at all since you\u2019ve also offered to pay for Ash\u2019s upkeep and to birdsit him when necessary.

As I\u2019m sure you\u2019re well aware, parrots are animals that do best when their caretaker not only knows how to tend their physical needs, but also genuinely enjoys engaging with them.  You\u2019ve taken care of the only good objection by offering to cover all the associated costs.  Ash should live with someone who takes joy in an obnoxious winged toddler, not someone who tolerates the bird for someone else\u2019s sake.  Being a good parrot-keeper requires some big lifestyle investments, and your uncle has already shaped his life around feathered companions.", "NTA. You did what was best for Ash. If you\u2019d kept him even though you didn\u2019t want to, both of you would have been miserable. I think your brother would be very happy his beloved bird got a great home. I\u2019m very sorry for your loss.", "NTA, you did what was right for the bird and your mother's ignorance of the deal between you and your uncle isnt am excuse for her behavior.

You did good, the parrot also deserves to be with someone that really wants to have them.", "Absolutely NTA. Parrots are hugely demanding pets, as you know, and keeping it when you're not able to meet it's needs would have been far worse than giving it away to someone both experienced and willing to care for it.", "NTA\n\nYou are being completely fair.  You are using the money your brother left you to pay for the bird's upkeep.  This was your mom's concern which you addressed.\n\nYour uncle loves parrots and had a parrot for a long time.  He even met Ash. \n\nHonestly, I think the reason your mom is upset is because that bird is the only living link she has to your brother.  I hope she goes into grief therapy to work on that. \n\nBecause you are absolutely doing right by the bird, just as your brother would have wanted.", "Nta\n\nNot the business of your mother, what other adults do", "NTA perfect solution", "NTA, sounds like the best possible solution to me.

So the basic is covered. If the parrot is happy there is no issue.", "NTA. It is a good solution. You haven't really given your brother's parrot away. You have found someone who will love and care for the parrot while using your brother's money to provide long-term care for the bird.

They need lots of attention and special care. She should want a good home for it.", "My uncle is way better prepared than I was.  A month and a half of dealing with Ash was already bugging me.", "I was actually a little mad at her until I read some of the comments.  I never thought about her still grieving.  I'm not the best with emotions either.  I guess I'm a lot like my brother.", "Furthermore, OP has entrusted the parrot to his uncle, who has already had a parrot, so he has experience, and OP will contribute financially to the treatment.

Greys are seriously smart birds, you have done what is best for the bird. Also truly sorry for your loss, it\u2019s never easy loosing a sibling.", "I want to.  I loved my brother.  It's the least I could do for someone who brought him so much joy.", "My uncle says he has a good bird vet.", "My uncle doesn't make a lot of money and birds like this are expensive.  She thought I was dumping the bird and keeping the money my brother left me for myself.", "It seems like you found a great solution.  I was thinking about it from the bird's prospective -- since they are so intelligent, they need a stable home with someone who really cares about and enjoys them.  It sounds like your uncle is better suited to do that than anyone else you know.", "NTA. Every YouTube I\u2019ve seen of life with parrots suggests you need a very specific lifestyle and unlimited patience - it\u2019s basically like having a feathery toddler in the house, except they don\u2019t grow out of it.", "I am really sorry for your loss. But her taking her grief out on you is unfair. It may be best to have this conversation with her that in order to give the best life for your brothers beloved animal, your uncle is the best guy to do so.", "I would imagine it is the mom's grief speaking. Her position on this particular issue is still wrong, but it's easy to imagine her deceased son's beloved pet would stir up some feelings.", "Grief, probably. It doesn't make her reaction okay, but her son did still die about a month and a half ago, which is not nearly enough time to fully process grief even if you're taking all the right steps and doing the work. Especially for an \"adult child passed before parent\" situation.", "NTA, you did very well, and (as an animal lover) I appreciate that you called the bird someone instead of some*thing*.", "I will be doing that.  A few comments have given me clarity I didn't have before.", "Especially since the bird didn\u2019t even go to a stranger, it went to a relative. Bird is still in the family.", "As a parrot owner, can I just say thank you for doing what\u2019s right for Ash? There are far too many people who would just dump a bird out in the wilderness if they didn\u2019t want it. That\u2019s how I\u2019ve gotten all of my foster birds that I\u2019ve rehabilitated. Granted, I foster small parrots, usually budgerigars, which are more \u201cdisposable\u201d in people\u2019s eyes than an African Grey, but still, people are unnecessarily cruel to parrots. You did the right thing by not only finding Ash a home with someone with previous parrot experience, but by offering to financially support Ash to ensure his continued health. In my eyes, that\u2019s going above and beyond the call of duty.\n\nYou\u2019re right that parrots are a huge responsibility. Not everyone is cut out to be a parrot owner. In fact, I\u2019d say that most people aren\u2019t. There is zero shame in admitting that you\u2019re not the right person for Ash to live with. When you take on a parrot, that is a lifelong commitment\u2014 you have to be prepared to take care of that bird until death do you part. That obviously wasn\u2019t something you were prepared to do, so instead of half-assing the care of Ash or dumping him somewhere, you made sure he\u2019s somewhere where he\u2019s safe, loved, and taken care of properly. That is a very noble thing to do, and I think your brother would be pleased with your decision. Your brother trusted you to do what was right for Ash, and ultimately, you fulfilled that duty.\n\nI do have one small suggestion, though. Take time to visit Ash every now and then! I\u2019m sure the two of you bonded a bit during his stay with you, and he\u2019s been through a rough time with the loss of his human dad. A visit from you every now and then would do wonders for him. It\u2019d also be a great way for you to feel close to Don, since he was so passionate about Ash and birds like him. You don\u2019t HAVE to do this, of course. But African Greys are as intelligent as small children. Ash will remember you, and I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll miss your company! It would be wonderful if you could stop by and catch up with him every now and again!", "NTA\n\nParrots have a long lifespan and they deserve to be loved and treated appropriately. \n\nYour lifestyle wasn\u2019t conducive to giving Ash his best life. But your uncle can. \n\nIf, whenever your uncle passes away, Ash is still alive? Maybe at that point in your life you will be more able and willing to care for an old parrot. Or you will likely step up and help find a caring home for him again. \n\nYou did right by the bird and by your brother. He loved that bird and wants it to have the best life possible.", "Nta- a commitment to any pet is a huge one. African greys have very strict requirements and of you were not comfortable with them finding the parrot a good home home with someone who is knowledgeable is a good compromise.", "NTA. She wasn't volunteering to help but expected you to just make accommodations in your life to take on a pet you don't want? \n\n\nPets need love and while I've never owned birds I know my dogs would have felt unloved and sad if they lived with someone who didn't show them affection or kindness. You were not the ideal caretaker for that bird. \n\n\nUncle is happy, Ash is happy, and you're contributing to the bird's monetary challenges for your uncle. No harm, no fowl.", "NTA, you knew your boundaries with the bird and found a place where he would be loved and cared for.", "NTA.  You mother refused to take the bird. You did not want the bird. Your uncle did and he has a lot of experience with the birds. You made a decision that was best for the bird.  If your mother is so upset, she can take the bird in.", "NTA. You found the bird a loving home, and that's the best thing you could have done. I will have the same conundrum when my parents pass. They have an African Grey that I dislike, and they are aware of this. They've made all their end of life plans except for where the bird should go. I have urged them to find a bird- loving person to bequeath her to, but they don't know anyone. I'll have to find someone myself when the day comes.", "NTA", "NTA. Not even a little bit.\n\nYou did everything in your power to make sure that this bird went to an experienced owner who had the time and the knowledge to provide high quality care. *And* you\u2019re using the money your brother left you for a purpose you know he\u2019d approve of. His beloved pet will spend many happy years with your uncle and no one will ever have to worry about how they\u2019ll pay the bills. This was the best possible outcome for everyone involved.\n\nI think your mother\u2019s anger at you is probably displaced grief.

Kudos", "NTA. \n\nMy dude, you got Ash a loving birdperson to look after him. You went above and beyond.", "NTA.  Not everyone is suited for having a pet, and by giving Ash to your uncle, and offering to pay for his vet bills, you made sure that he stays in the family.", "NTA.  You can love your brother and not want to care for his pet for the rest of you/its life.  Faced a similar issue with my brother's cat when he passed.  I am sorry for your loss.  FYI people who loved him, like your mother, may react strangely to the weirdest thing as part of their way of processing grief.  I still can't even talk about my brother around my mother.", "NTA.\n\nSorry for your loss.\n\nI'm glad you added the edit.", "NTA - you found a loving new home for ash & it\u2019s your uncle. \nSo it\u2019s not like you gave the parrot away to just anybody.\nYou also would pay the vet bills & birdsit for your uncle.\nDon\u2019t see any assholeness here", "NTA", "NTA.

This is none of your mom's business.", "NTA", "You made the best choice for the bird. Your uncle likes birds and knows how to let the parrot live it\u2019s best live. Parrot will be happier and parrot will enrich your uncle\u2019s life. The fact you are covering expenses proves you wants what\u2019s best for the parrot.

But your mum is still grieving and maybe talk to her more?", "NTA.\n\nYou\u2019ve left a bird that you don\u2019t want to care for, with someone who wants to and knowledgeably can.

I hope your mom comes to understand this.", "NTA. You did the right thing. This parrot is going to be cared for and be in good hands, and you offering to cover vet bills was the right thing to do. Your mother\u2019s reaction was unfair of her.", "Nta you found Ash a safe, *educated*, home within the family!  \n\nThe fact that Uncle is financially unable to have a bird is moot bc you're paying!  In fact, it sounds like this worked out really well for your uncle too. He likes parrots but couldn't afford one.  You can afford one but don't want one.  Combined, it's perfect.\n\nThe parrot may outlive your uncle though,  so that is something to keep in mind for the future.", "NTA. You are never an asshole for reforming inherited pets. You didn\u2019t chose to have those pets they were forced upon you.\n\nAnd your uncle and Ash are both happy, you mother is probably just huffy because your uncle now has a commitment and won\u2019t play errand boy for her as much.", "NTA, your mother needs to step off.", "Nta. You gave the bird to a trusted family member who knows how to take care of him and you\u2019re paying the bird\u2019s bills. This sounds win/win.", "NTA you did the right thing, especially because you are paying for all its expenses. And your uncle seems to enjoy birds. A win-win.\n\nalso don\u2019t put much thought into him leaving the bird in his will to you. A condition to adopt one is to have proof of having its care designated after your death listed in your will. He probably just picked you because you were the easy choice.", "NTA.  That type of parrot needs a consistent owner who enjoys caring for it.  They can literally tear out all of their feathers if they don't get enough attention.  They tend to bond with one person, so the bird is probably having a tough time after your brother died.  The uncle sounds like a perfect person to care for the bird, and if you are paying for it's care, it's a win-win.", "NTA. Don would understand. Give yourself and your mom a hug from me.", "NTA. \n\nBirds are a lot of work and also can become depressed or violent when their owner passes. They are also A LOT OF WORK. It seems you found a good solution- your uncle wants the bird and you offered to help with costs. \n\nYour mom is mad you gave the bird to your uncle, but since she wouldn't take the bird, I guess her expectation is that you keep the bird? That's not how any of this works. You owe your brother finding the bird a good home, not sacrificing your life to keep his bird.", "I started reading your post and was going to give a soft YTA.\n\nMy reasoning is that if I ever die, I will be rolling in my grave if one of my family members didn't take my dogs in. They are my babies. I love them like children. I took responsibility for them and even if I were to die my last wish would be for my family to take my dogs in. I'd be heart broken if they ended up in a shelter or an abusive home because I died.\n\n\n\n\nThat being said, after reading your entire post I have to say NTA.\n\n\nYou found his bird a home with someone who is family and who has experience with birds. In addition to that you've offered to pay to take care of him.\n\n\nI'm sure your brother would be appreciative of your actions", "NTA, you were patient and found the exact home that was a good fit for the bird and you\u2019re still offering to help financially. This is why your brother willed you the parrot. He knew that you would find him the best home.", "NTA, especially since you will help the uncle with $$ for the bird. If your uncle didn\u2019t want the parrot he would not have been willing.", "NTA. \n\nYou rehomed a long-lived pet that wasn't yours to begin with, with a person who'd love and care for it well. A close person that you and the deceased owner already knew. An uncle who'd already met the bird in question. AND you're covering its costs.\n\nI feel like your mother just wants an argument.", "NTA. If your mother cares so much she should have taken the parrot. It's easy to judge when you're not being inconvenienced.", "NTA especially as you are going to keep paying for the bird you have housed them eith someone who actually likes birds amd are making sure tgey are with someone they know in the family.", "NTA - parrots are not for everyone. It would be unfair for the bird the keep it when you couldn't care for it properly. Your uncle knew what he was getting into and accepted it willingly.", "NTA.\n\nYour edit made me cackle", "NTA. \n\nYour uncle is in effect a long-term foster for Ash, as you are covering all the expenses (make sure to ask your uncle for Ash's total food bill amount, they don't eat just seeds).", "Nta. You don't want it so you found him a Home where he's wanted and well taken care of.\n\nJust because somebody leaves me something in their will doesn't you have to accept it", "I also snorted when you have your uncle \"the bird\".", "NTA, but any chance you can send your uncle money occasionally to help defer the costs of Ash's care? It seems like it's working out incredibly well for you to be absolved of this issue, and Uncle will hopefully really enjoy Ash, but your mother's concern that he cannot afford the care seems valid and that it might be a minor point for you to send some money to him occasionally (maybe annually) to help ensure Ash continues to be cared for without becoming an undue burden.", "NTA, as this is for the best for Ash and knowing your own limitations. But as someone who\u2019s neurodivergent (ASD and ADHD), the comment about knowing about them more than anyone \u201cnormal\u201d should is bordering on AH territory for a different topic than what this post is about.", "OP you would have been the AH for keeping a bird that you don\u2019t want and engaging with it as little as you could. You found it a really great home and you\u2019re taking financial responsibility for it. You\u2019re awesome, your mom probably has some resolved trauma.", "My aunt is a bird person and from what I understand parrots are basically on the same emotional level as a toddler.  They fiercely bond with people, they're very emotionally needy, and will engage in destructive (including self destructive, i.e., feather plucking) behavior if they're seriously upset.\n\nThey're really not easy pets, but for the right person they're very rewarding.", "'Hand raised psychopath with feathers and a pair of pliers on his face' describes so many birds I know. Love the little assholes, but they are a lot of work, and they will suffer in a home that doesn't want or know how and is willing to take proper care of them. This was the best possible solution. NAH.", "Hopefully this comment makes it up to the top. NAH for sure.", "Even if he had told his brother they, he still wouldn\u2019t be an asshole for rehoming the bird  after finding out he couldn\u2019t actually care far it. It\u2019s no good for any pet to stay somewhere where they are resented.", "Agreed, even if op wasn't willing to support financially or parrotsit, he would still be nta. Ash is still in the family (that he's familiar with as per playdates) , and his uncle is a grown-up.", "They are interesting birds. I don't know much about caring for them, but I'm guessing it does require a lot of work. I had a friend whose girlfriend had one named Pooky. Pooky could imitate the girlfriend's voice so accurately that it often fooled me. When the phone would ring Pooky would say, \"Hello\" in the girlfriend's voice just like she would when answering the phone.\n\nHis cage and perch were next to the light switch for the living room area. When he got tired he would say, \"Good night\" in the girlfriend's voice and turn off the lights and go into his cage.", "Maybe your brother left you the bird over your mother or other family because he knew you would make the right decision for Ash?", "Your title is misleading. You rehomed Ash, you were deliberate and put a lot of effort into it. Even offered to use your inheritance to help cover expenses. If I die before my pets i hope the people in my life give as much care to them as you did. NTA.", "If your uncle struggles financially maybe give him more of that, nice chunk of change, your brother gave you. It\u2019s great that you\u2019re covering the food and vet bills but there may be some more expenses surrounding the bird so maybe just provide a bit extra so that the uncle has a little bit of a surplus instead of a deficit. He also did you all a huge favour and had your brother known that the uncle would have looked after the bird im sure he would have provided an amount towards the uncle. \n\nAnyway, well done for finding a good solution and for honouring your brother.", "It really depends on the breed.  African Grey's are renowned for being extremely intelligent (relatively).  They will generally bond with one person in a household and will barely tolerate anyone else.   My parents bought me one when I was about 14 ( a very long time ago), it grew attached to my mother as she was the one that ended up doing all the cleaning etc.\n\nIt hated my father, and would dive bomb his head from the top of its cage beak first lol\n\nMy mother developed alzheimers, my father obviously couldn't cope with it and was in a very similar situation to the OP.   He gave it to a friend who has a lifelong love of parrots.", "You and I disagree there. If you make a promise, you have an obligation to stick by it. Integrity is important. \n\nWould it still have been the right thing to rehome the bird as it deserves to be wanted? Yes. But in that situation, they would have some YTA responsibility for making a promise they had failed to keep - which was my point.", "He will know one after having a feathered friend for years.", "A feathery toddler with scissors and pliers permanently affixed.", "Hahahahaha this is hilarious", "My Nan had a Myna Bird when I was growing up. Every bit as smart as a parrot, but with a huge attitude problem!\n\nHis name was Charlie, and he was an utter terror! He learned to call their cat, Winnie, in my Nan's voice. Poor Winnie would come running every time, which Charlie seemed to think was hilarious.\n\nThey moved his cage from its usual spot, which he didn't like. He quickly found the air vent next to the new spot and whistled down it non-stop until they moved him back.\n\nWhen he played up, Nan would tell him \"You're raggy! You're a raggy, horrible bird!\" So of course he would tell anyone who came near him \"You're raggy!\"\n\nShe couldn't line his cage with anything. He hated paper so much that he would tear it into tiny little bits and throw the bits out.\n\nIf he decided he wasn't getting enough attention, he would demand \"Come up 'ere!\" as loud as he could, which was pretty damn loud!\n\nThat bird was a terrifying legend!", "Your uncle knew what he was getting into and accepted it willingly.", "So... A toddler who was left unsupervised with art supplies...", "I can attest to the fact that every toddler has pliers..  You wouldn't think that they would have the pinching grip that they do... \ud83d\ude2c", "This is hilarious. I would be unnerved by a pet that talks back", "And wings.", "More like [woodworking](https://youtu.be/EEtNsSwFFMU) tools."]}
