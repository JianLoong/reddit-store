He fell in love with our uncle's parrot when we were young. He always wanted one and when he got a job where he could take care of one he got it.  \n\nDon was neurodivergent. He had trouble connecting with people.  But he loved that bird.  And it seemed to return the affection.  \n\nDon didn't like to travel. Or leave his home. Or do much besides work, play video games, collect Pokemon stuff, and interact with his parrot.  \n\nI, on the other hand, try and get out of town whenever I can. I also use every second of my vacation time and PTO. \n\nDon passed away just after New Year's.  He didn't have a girlfriend, much less a wife. He did have a will and he left me everything. Including Ash his parrot. \n\nI don't want his parrot.  Trust me after listening to my brother talk about African Grey Parrots for the last 20 years I know more about them than anyone normal should.  Including that they can live up to 60 years.  That's would have been great for Don. I on the other hand am not planning on taking care of any human children I have for 60 years.  \n\nI talked to my parents to see if they would take him\n They said their condo doesn't allow pets. I checked with the rest of our family and nobody wanted to make that commitment. \n\nI contacted a local bird rescue but they only take wild raptors. I tried the zoo. They do not accept birds.  I guess there is a chance of diseases or something.  \n\nMy brother loved this bird so I wasn't going to do anything stupid with it. Ash was actually growing on me. I was considering keeping him. Lucky for me and Ash my uncle finally got back to me.  His parrot had died a couple of years ago and since he is in his late forties he didn't adopt a new one.  \n\nI gladly invited him over to see if he liked Ash. He told me that he and his old bird has met Ash. And even been over to Don's house for a playdate before.  \n\nIt was excellent. My uncle knows more about them than my brother did. And now I have that information stuck in my head.  \n\nAsh went to live with my uncle.  I thought it was the perfect solution. Until my mom called to chew me out for imposing a bird on my uncle.  He doesn't make that much money and birds are expensive to take care of I guess. \n\nNot that it was any of her business but my brother left me a nice chunk of change. And an impressive collection of Pokemon stuff. I had already told my uncle that I would be paying for food and vet bills for Ash.  I even volunteered to birdsit him if my uncle needed and I'm on town. I know Don would want that.  \n\nShe still said that it was a bad decision to give her brother the bird. I probably didn't improve our conversation by giggling when she said that. \n\nI honestly think I did right by everyone involved.  But my mom disagrees.  I need someone with no skin in the game to tell me if I'm missing something.\n\nEdit\n\nWhen I said normal I didn't mean neurotypical. I meant not obsessed with parrots.", "created_utc": 1676459906, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/112vqet/aita_for_giving_away_my_brothers_parrot/", "score": 61, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You found Ash a loving home with an experienced person. You might have slipped into Y T A territory if you hadn't volunteered to cover the expenses for the bird.  Your brother would love to know that the person who inspired his love of that species was the person you entrusted to care for his Ash.  \n\nI also snorted when you have your uncle \"the bird\".", "NTA. What does your mother expect you to do? Take care of a bird you don't want? Your uncle is more experienced and loves them. You even solved the financial issue by offering to contribute. What else is there for your mother to complain about?", "NTA \n\nParrots are a big undertaking, and you took the time to ensure it would be looked after.  African Grey's particularly are very good mimics, and it is not unusual for a parrot being passed through generations as the original owner has died.  This can be a traumatic experience for the adopted owner as they can and will say things in the exact voice of their dead relative.", "NTA.\n\nYou went above and beyond, you've done more than right, you've done golden. \n\nI think your Mom's just deep in her grief. Let it roll off you like water on feathers.", "NAH. First, I am so sorry, you have my deep condolences. Secondly you have BOTH ensured that the most qualified and loving member of the family will care for Ash and ALSO ensured that your uncle will not have to bear the financial burden but instead your brothers estate will support Ash the way he would have wanted. *That is the best possible outcome*. Parrots NEED companionship. You are unable, and *unwilling* to care for him, but you are honoring your brother the best way you know how. You have made a FABULOUS choice. Your mother's reaction is understandable, she is grieving and probably wanted to be able to visit Ash, she probably had a vision for Ash's care that was very important to her *because her child just died and Ash was clearly the most important aspect of your brothers life outside of you and your parents*. It's ok that you and your parents have different views of the best care for Ash, but unless your mother is ready to step up she needs to respect your decision.", "NTA your uncle is a grown ass man who knows the costs associated with the kind of bird *he's already had*. Your mother can either take the bird herself or flock off (ba dum tss). In all seriousness I bet this has more to do with the loss of your brother, my condolences,  rather than your uncles fiances.", "NTA....sounds like the bird will be loved and taken care of. Mom needs to chill ...", "I got birds, too many birds. One of them will live as long as the grey. He\u2019s a rescue, he was someone else\u2019s problem, now he\u2019s mine. He could well out live me. He\u2019s a hand raised psychopath with feathers and a pair of pliers on his face. I\u2019m quietly confident you did the right thing. He\u2019s now your uncles problem financially. No longer your concern. He knows birds he knows what he\u2019s taken on.", "NTA. Especially as you'll be paying for food and vet.", "NTA. Your mom really isn't either, I think she meant well, but may not understand that a bird is better off with someone who truly wants it as part of their life. \n\nI have a friend involved in parrot rescue, and its extremely common unfortunately that one outlives their person. It's rare a family member is willing to even try to care for the bird, so I give you credit for that. The parrot can have a better life with someone who really wants it as a big part of their life though. I'd personally never want one at all, even trying was a huge thing on your part.", "NTA.\n\nYour uncle was interested in Ash, knew Ash before your brother passed away, and was willing to take Ash. What is your mom going on about?\n\nI\u2019m sorry for the loss of your brother", "NTA  \n\n\nYour mother doesn't have enough information to make a proper judgement, she's going off assumptions.  Furthermore, the proper information is none of her beeswax.", "NTA, but even for you to be the A your mom would need a better plan for the bird. It seems like she might be sentimentally angry, like angry that you\u2019re \u201cgiving away a piece of your brother.\u201d It\u2019s not rational, but grief almost never is.", "NTA. Sounds like the best home for the parrot.", "Absolutely NTA. Parrots have *incredibly* high social needs, and IMO it is borderline animal cruelty for people who do not understand/aren't motivated to meet those needs to keep them. You did the right thing by recognizing you weren't equipped to take care of Ash and rehoming him to someone willing and experienced with parrots. Your mom *might* have had a leg to stand on with the financial aspect, but since you have that covered that's not a good argument either. \n\nI think your mom is likely struggling with grief and her brain has latched onto this issue.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It is really nice, that the bird goes to someone who knew him and also really likes it. I don't get, why your mother doesn't like the agreement. It sounds like you did all you could and you are still taking agreed to take the bird for birdsitting and paying for it. That's really nice.", "NTA\n\nIf your uncle took proper care for his last bird he will do so with Ash as well.", "Unless you had explicitly said to your brother you would care for him after he was gone, then you have done the best thing possible. Pets deserve a home that wants them.", "NTA. Parrots are notoriously difficult to re-home. The fact that you managed it at all is pretty remarkable and you seem to have done a decent job. One thing to consider, do the parents consider the parrot a last link with their kid? Would visiting it regularly help with that?", "You don't want the bird, but did your best to get the bird a good home. Nobody else wanted to bother with it. And you didn't force your uncle to take him, your uncle offered. Seems perfectly reasonable to me, NTA.", "NTA,  you're fine. Mom needs to mind her own business. The arrangements you made is between you and your uncle,  period.", "NTA, and I\u2019m sorry for the loss of your brother. As someone who has a bird, they are a huge commitment and a lot of work although they are also extremely rewarding. You did the right thing looking for someone who knows something about birds to take Ash in, and if your uncle knows birds then he was a good choice. You\u2019ve not imposed on him at all since you\u2019ve also offered to pay for Ash\u2019s upkeep and to birdsit him when necessary. You did everything that you could, and everything you did was right in terms of bird care.", "NTA. Even if mom and uncle lived with each other, it's still his decision to take it and credit to you for paying up (some of) the bills.", "NTA You did everything right your mom is being the a-hole.", "NTA.  As I\u2019m sure you\u2019re well aware, parrots are animals that do best when their caretaker not only knows how to tend their physical needs, but also genuinely enjoys engaging with them.  You\u2019ve taken care of the only good objection by offering to cover all the associated costs.  Ash should live with someone who takes joy in an obnoxious winged toddler, not someone who tolerates the bird for someone else\u2019s sake.  Being a good parrot-keeper requires some big lifestyle investments, and your uncle has already shaped his life around feathered companions.", "NTA. You did what was best for Ash. If you\u2019d kept him even though you didn\u2019t want to, both of you would have been miserable. I think your brother would be very happy his beloved bird got a great home. I\u2019m very sorry for your loss.", "NTA, you did what was right for the bird and your mother's ignorance of the deal between you and your uncle isnt am excuse for her behavior. She's right though at lesst on the cost of vet care. Bird are generally filed under \"exotic\" pets so a clinic with an avian specialist will be needed.", "NTA - You did a good job , the parrot is leaving with someone who wants him", "Bird in a loving home - you making sure bird you don\u2019t want is financially taken care of. Win-win", "NTA \n\nI think you managed the situation quite nicely! \n\nYour mom is grieving and nothing you did would have been right.. and she didn\u2019t volunteer her services did she. You did a win win situation and as a animal lover.. I commend you for it\u2665\ufe0f. \n\nI\u2019m sorry for your loss", "NTA \n\nYou found a loving home with someone who loves parrots as much as your brother did. Better yet, it\u2019s with the uncle that sparked your brothers love of parrots! It\u2019s fitting that the parrot went to Uncle, especially since you are helping cost wise.", "NTA. You found a great person to take care of the parrot, someone that even met and likes him. He's also family! You did good, the parrot also deserves to be with someone that really wants to have them.", "Absolutely NTA. Parrots are hugely demanding pets, as you know, and keeping it when you're not able to meet it's needs would have been far worse than giving it away to someone both experienced and willing to care for it.", "NTA\n\nYou are being completely fair.  You are using the money your brother left you to pay for the bird's upkeep.  This was your mom's concern which you addressed.\n\nYour uncle loves parrots and had a parrot for a long time.  He even met Ash. \n\nHonestly, I think the reason your mom is upset is because that bird is the only living link she has to your brother.  I hope she goes into grief therapy to work on that. \n\nBecause you are absolutely doing right by the bird, just as your brother would have wanted.", "Nta\n\nNot the business of your mother, what other adults do", "NTA perfect solution", "NTA, sounds like the best possible solution to me. I guess your brother meant well, leaving you the parrot, but from yoru description of the situation this seems to be a better arrangement.", "NTA he's already been looking after one for years and it's not really her business what her adult brother wants to do with us time and money", "NTA-  You pay for the vet bills and food. So the basic is covered. If the parrot is happy there is no issue.", "NTA. It is a good solution. You haven't really given your brother's parrot away. You have found someone who will love and care for the parrot while using your brother's money to provide long-term care for the bird. Might be wise keeping that money on a separate account and giving your uncle a float on prepay credit card for emergency care.\nYour mother is interfering without caring about full facts.", "NTA -  You did everything right. You acknowledge you don't have the skillset to care for the bird, you  found someone who had experience with birds and was interested, even better they are family! And you are helping with costs.You did great!\nPS did your mother offer any other solutions? Besides being upset?", "NTA.\n\nYou went out of your way to see to it that Ash ended up in a good home. That's everything you could have done :)", "NTA. I think you made very wise decisions and kept the best interests of everyone in mind. I\u2019m not sure why your mother is making it an issue", "NTA \nAtleast your family still have contact with Ash and uncle plus you\u2019re taking care of the necessities. I think its a smart decision", "NTA, it\u2019s good you decided to take the time to actually give the parrot a safe place to be, it\u2019s not your fault nobody had wanted to commit before your uncle came along, good on your uncle, I do think maybe the mom doesn\u2019t know the full pictures", "Your mom can disagree all she wants but if you don't want the bird then the care for the bird might suffer if in your care for too long. They need lots of attention and special care. She should want a good home for it.", "My uncle is way better prepared than I was.  A month and a half of dealing with Ash was already bugging me.", "I was actually a little mad at her until I read some of the comments.  I never thought about her still grieving.  I'm not the best with emotions either.  I guess I'm a lot like my brother.", "Furthermore, OP has entrusted the parrot to his uncle, who has already had a parrot, so he has experience, and OP will contribute financially to the treatment. It is the most suitable choice.\n\n\rI really don't understand why OP's mother got upset \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Forgot to add NTA. Greys are seriously smart birds, you have done what is best for the bird. Also truly sorry for your loss, it\u2019s never easy loosing a sibling.", "I want to.  I loved my brother.  It's the least I could do for someone who brought him so much joy.", "My uncle says he has a good bird vet.", "My uncle doesn't make a lot of money and birds like this are expensive.  She thought I was dumping the bird and keeping the money my brother left me for myself.", "It seems like you found a great solution.  I was thinking about it from the bird's prospective -- since they are so intelligent, they need a stable home with someone who really cares about and enjoys them.  It sounds like your uncle is better suited to do that than anyone else you know.", "NTA. Every YouTube I\u2019ve seen of life with parrots suggests you need a very specific lifestyle and unlimited patience - it\u2019s basically like having a feathery toddler in the house, except they don\u2019t grow out of it.", "I am really sorry for your loss. But her taking her grief out on you is unfair. It may be best to have this conversation with her that in order to give the best life for your brothers beloved animal, your uncle is the best guy to do so.", "I would imagine it is the mom's grief speaking. Her position on this particular issue is still wrong, but it's easy to imagine her deceased son's beloved pet would stir up some feelings.", "Grief, probably. It doesn't make her reaction okay, but her son did still die about a month and a half ago, which is not nearly enough time to fully process grief even if you're taking all the right steps and doing the work. Especially for an \"adult child passed before parent\" situation.", "NTA, you did very well, and (as an animal lover) I appreciate that you called the bird someone instead of some*thing*.", "I will be doing that.  A few comments have given me clarity I didn't have before.", "Especially since the bird didn\u2019t even go to a stranger, it went to a relative. Bird is still in the family."]}
