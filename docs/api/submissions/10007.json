He fell in love with our uncle's parrot when we were young. He always wanted one and when he got a job where he could take care of one he got it.  \n\nDon was neurodivergent. He had trouble connecting with people.  But he loved that bird.  And it seemed to return the affection.  \n\nDon didn't like to travel. Or leave his home. Or do much besides work, play video games, collect Pokemon stuff, and interact with his parrot.  \n\nI, on the other hand, try and get out of town whenever I can. I also use every second of my vacation time and PTO. \n\nDon passed away just after New Year's.  He didn't have a girlfriend, much less a wife. He did have a will and he left me everything. Including Ash his parrot. \n\nI don't want his parrot.  Trust me after listening to my brother talk about African Grey Parrots for the last 20 years I know more about them than anyone normal should.  Including that they can live up to 60 years.  That's would have been great for Don. I on the other hand am not planning on taking care of any human children I have for 60 years.  \n\nI talked to my parents to see if they would take him\n They said their condo doesn't allow pets. I checked with the rest of our family and nobody wanted to make that commitment. \n\nI contacted a local bird rescue but they only take wild raptors. I tried the zoo. They do not accept birds.  I guess there is a chance of diseases or something.  \n\nMy brother loved this bird so I wasn't going to do anything stupid with it. Ash was actually growing on me. I was considering keeping him. Lucky for me and Ash my uncle finally got back to me.  His parrot had died a couple of years ago and since he is in his late forties he didn't adopt a new one.  \n\nI gladly invited him over to see if he liked Ash. He told me that he and his old bird has met Ash. And even been over to Don's house for a playdate before.  \n\nIt was excellent. My uncle knows more about them than my brother did. And now I have that information stuck in my head.  \n\nAsh went to live with my uncle.  I thought it was the perfect solution. Until my mom called to chew me out for imposing a bird on my uncle.  He doesn't make that much money and birds are expensive to take care of I guess. \n\nNot that it was any of her business but my brother left me a nice chunk of change. And an impressive collection of Pokemon stuff. I had already told my uncle that I would be paying for food and vet bills for Ash.  I even volunteered to birdsit him if my uncle needed and I'm on town. I know Don would want that.  \n\nShe still said that it was a bad decision to give her brother the bird. I probably didn't improve our conversation by giggling when she said that. \n\nI honestly think I did right by everyone involved.  But my mom disagrees.  I need someone with no skin in the game to tell me if I'm missing something.\n\nEdit\n\nWhen I said normal I didn't mean neurotypical.

Secondly you have BOTH ensured that the most qualified and loving member of the family will care for Ash and ALSO ensured that your uncle will not have to bear the financial burden but instead your brothers estate will support Ash the way he would have wanted. *That is the best possible outcome*. Parrots NEED companionship. You are unable, and *unwilling* to care for him, but you are honoring your brother the best way you know how. You have made a FABULOUS choice. Your mother's reaction is understandable, she is grieving and probably wanted to be able to visit Ash, she probably had a vision for Ash's care that was very important to her *because her child just died and Ash was clearly the most important aspect of your brothers life outside of you and your parents*. It's ok that you and your parents have different views of the best care for Ash, but unless your mother is ready to step up she needs to respect your decision.", "NTA your uncle is a grown ass man who knows the costs associated with the kind of bird *he's already had*.

Your mom really isn't either, I think she meant well, but may not understand that a bird is better off with someone who truly wants it as part of their life. \n\nI have a friend involved in parrot rescue, and its extremely common unfortunately that one outlives their person. It's rare a family member is willing to even try to care for the bird, so I give you credit for that. The parrot can have a better life with someone who really wants it as a big part of their life though. I'd personally never want one at all, even trying was a huge thing on your part.", "NTA.\n\nYour uncle was interested in Ash, knew Ash before your brother passed away, and was willing to take Ash.

Parrots have *incredibly* high social needs, and IMO it is borderline animal cruelty for people who do not understand/aren't motivated to meet those needs to keep them. You did the right thing by recognizing you weren't equipped to take care of Ash and rehoming him to someone willing and experienced with parrots. Your mom *might* have had a leg to stand on with the financial aspect, but since you have that covered that's not a good argument either. \n\nI think your mom is likely struggling with grief and her brain has latched onto this issue.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

That's really nice.", "NTA\n\nIf your uncle took proper care for his last bird he will do so with Ash as well.", "Unless you had explicitly said to your brother you would care for him after he was gone, then you have done the best thing possible. Pets deserve a home that wants them.", "NTA. Parrots are notoriously difficult to re-home. The fact that you managed it at all is pretty remarkable and you seem to have done a decent job. One thing to consider, do the parents consider the parrot a last link with their kid? Would visiting it regularly help with that?", "You don't want the bird, but did your best to get the bird a good home. Nobody else wanted to bother with it. And you didn't force your uncle to take him, your uncle offered. Seems perfectly reasonable to me, NTA.", "NTA,  you're fine. Mom needs to mind her own business. The arrangements you made is between you and your uncle,  period.", "NTA, and I\u2019m sorry for the loss of your brother. As someone who has a bird, they are a huge commitment and a lot of work although they are also extremely rewarding. You did the right thing looking for someone who knows something about birds to take Ash in, and if your uncle knows birds then he was a good choice. You\u2019ve not imposed on him at all since you\u2019ve also offered to pay for Ash\u2019s upkeep and to birdsit him when necessary.

As I\u2019m sure you\u2019re well aware, parrots are animals that do best when their caretaker not only knows how to tend their physical needs, but also genuinely enjoys engaging with them.  You\u2019ve taken care of the only good objection by offering to cover all the associated costs.  Ash should live with someone who takes joy in an obnoxious winged toddler, not someone who tolerates the bird for someone else\u2019s sake.  Being a good parrot-keeper requires some big lifestyle investments, and your uncle has already shaped his life around feathered companions.", "NTA. You did what was best for Ash. If you\u2019d kept him even though you didn\u2019t want to, both of you would have been miserable. I think your brother would be very happy his beloved bird got a great home. I\u2019m very sorry for your loss.", "NTA, you did what was right for the bird and your mother's ignorance of the deal between you and your uncle isnt am excuse for her behavior.

You did good, the parrot also deserves to be with someone that really wants to have them.", "Absolutely NTA. Parrots are hugely demanding pets, as you know, and keeping it when you're not able to meet it's needs would have been far worse than giving it away to someone both experienced and willing to care for it.", "NTA\n\nYou are being completely fair.  You are using the money your brother left you to pay for the bird's upkeep.  This was your mom's concern which you addressed.\n\nYour uncle loves parrots and had a parrot for a long time.  He even met Ash. \n\nHonestly, I think the reason your mom is upset is because that bird is the only living link she has to your brother.  I hope she goes into grief therapy to work on that. \n\nBecause you are absolutely doing right by the bird, just as your brother would have wanted.", "Nta\n\nNot the business of your mother, what other adults do", "NTA perfect solution", "NTA, sounds like the best possible solution to me.

So the basic is covered. If the parrot is happy there is no issue.", "NTA. It is a good solution. You haven't really given your brother's parrot away. You have found someone who will love and care for the parrot while using your brother's money to provide long-term care for the bird. Might be wise keeping that money on a separate account and giving your uncle a float on prepay credit card for emergency care.\nYour mother is interfering without caring about full facts.", "NTA -  You did everything right.

They need lots of attention and special care. She should want a good home for it.", "My uncle is way better prepared than I was.  A month and a half of dealing with Ash was already bugging me.", "I was actually a little mad at her until I read some of the comments.  I never thought about her still grieving.  I'm not the best with emotions either.  I guess I'm a lot like my brother.", "Furthermore, OP has entrusted the parrot to his uncle, who has already had a parrot, so he has experience, and OP will contribute financially to the treatment.

Greys are seriously smart birds, you have done what is best for the bird. Also truly sorry for your loss, it\u2019s never easy loosing a sibling.", "I want to.  I loved my brother.  It's the least I could do for someone who brought him so much joy.", "My uncle says he has a good bird vet.", "My uncle doesn't make a lot of money and birds like this are expensive.  She thought I was dumping the bird and keeping the money my brother left me for myself.", "It seems like you found a great solution.  I was thinking about it from the bird's prospective -- since they are so intelligent, they need a stable home with someone who really cares about and enjoys them.  It sounds like your uncle is better suited to do that than anyone else you know.", "NTA. Every YouTube I\u2019ve seen of life with parrots suggests you need a very specific lifestyle and unlimited patience - it\u2019s basically like having a feathery toddler in the house, except they don\u2019t grow out of it.", "I am really sorry for your loss. But her taking her grief out on you is unfair. It may be best to have this conversation with her that in order to give the best life for your brothers beloved animal, your uncle is the best guy to do so.", "I would imagine it is the mom's grief speaking. Her position on this particular issue is still wrong, but it's easy to imagine her deceased son's beloved pet would stir up some feelings.", "Grief, probably. It doesn't make her reaction okay, but her son did still die about a month and a half ago, which is not nearly enough time to fully process grief even if you're taking all the right steps and doing the work. Especially for an \"adult child passed before parent\" situation.", "NTA, you did very well, and (as an animal lover) I appreciate that you called the bird someone instead of some*thing*.", "I will be doing that.  A few comments have given me clarity I didn't have before.", "Especially since the bird didn\u2019t even go to a stranger, it went to a relative. Bird is still in the family.", "As a parrot owner, can I just say thank you for doing what\u2019s right for Ash? There are far too many people who would just dump a bird out in the wilderness if they didn\u2019t want it. That\u2019s how I\u2019ve gotten all of my foster birds that I\u2019ve rehabilitated. Granted, I foster small parrots, usually budgerigars, which are more \u201cdisposable\u201d in people\u2019s eyes than an African Grey, but still, people are unnecessarily cruel to parrots. You did the right thing by not only finding Ash a home with someone with previous parrot experience, but by offering to financially support Ash to ensure his continued health. In my eyes, that\u2019s going above and beyond the call of duty.\n\nYou\u2019re right that parrots are a huge responsibility. Not everyone is cut out to be a parrot owner. In fact, I\u2019d say that most people aren\u2019t. There is zero shame in admitting that you\u2019re not the right person for Ash to live with. When you take on a parrot, that is a lifelong commitment\u2014 you have to be prepared to take care of that bird until death do you part. That obviously wasn\u2019t something you were prepared to do, so instead of half-assing the care of Ash or dumping him somewhere, you made sure he\u2019s somewhere where he\u2019s safe, loved, and taken care of properly. That is a very noble thing to do, and I think your brother would be pleased with your decision. Your brother trusted you to do what was right for Ash, and ultimately, you fulfilled that duty.\n\nI do have one small suggestion, though. Take time to visit Ash every now and then! I\u2019m sure the two of you bonded a bit during his stay with you, and he\u2019s been through a rough time with the loss of his human dad. A visit from you every now and then would do wonders for him. It\u2019d also be a great way for you to feel close to Don, since he was so passionate about Ash and birds like him. You don\u2019t HAVE to do this, of course. But African Greys are as intelligent as small children. Ash will remember you, and I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll miss your company! It would be wonderful if you could stop by and catch up with him every now and again!", "NTA\n\nParrots have a long lifespan and they deserve to be loved and treated appropriately. \n\nYour lifestyle wasn\u2019t conducive to giving Ash his best life. But your uncle can. \n\nIf, whenever your uncle passes away, Ash is still alive? Maybe at that point in your life you will be more able and willing to care for an old parrot. Or you will likely step up and help find a caring home for him again. \n\nYou did right by the bird and by your brother. He loved that bird and wants it to have the best life possible.", "Nta- a commitment to any pet is a huge one. African greys have very strict requirements and of you were not comfortable with them finding the parrot a good home home with someone who is knowledgeable is a good compromise.", "NTA. She wasn't volunteering to help but expected you to just make accommodations in your life to take on a pet you don't want? \n\n\nPets need love and while I've never owned birds I know my dogs would have felt unloved and sad if they lived with someone who didn't show them affection or kindness. You were not the ideal caretaker for that bird. \n\n\nUncle is happy, Ash is happy, and you're contributing to the bird's monetary challenges for your uncle. No harm, no fowl.", "NTA, you knew your boundaries with the bird and found a place where he would be loved and cared for.", "NTA.  You mother refused to take the bird. You did not want the bird. Your uncle did and he has a lot of experience with the birds. You made a decision that was best for the bird.  If your mother is so upset, she can take the bird in.", "NTA. You found the bird a loving home, and that's the best thing you could have done. I will have the same conundrum when my parents pass. They have an African Grey that I dislike, and they are aware of this. They've made all their end of life plans except for where the bird should go. I have urged them to find a bird- loving person to bequeath her to, but they don't know anyone. I'll have to find someone myself when the day comes.", "NTA", "NTA. Not even a little bit.\n\nYou did everything in your power to make sure that this bird went to an experienced owner who had the time and the knowledge to provide high quality care. *And* you\u2019re using the money your brother left you for a purpose you know he\u2019d approve of. His beloved pet will spend many happy years with your uncle and no one will ever have to worry about how they\u2019ll pay the bills. This was the best possible outcome for everyone involved.\n\nI think your mother\u2019s anger at you is probably displaced grief.

Kudos", "NTA. \n\nMy dude, you got Ash a loving birdperson to look after him. You went above and beyond.", "NTA.  Not everyone is suited for having a pet, and by giving Ash to your uncle, and offering to pay for his vet bills, you made sure that he stays in the family.", "NTA.  You can love your brother and not want to care for his pet for the rest of you/its life.  Faced a similar issue with my brother's cat when he passed.  I am sorry for your loss.  FYI people who loved him, like your mother, may react strangely to the weirdest thing as part of their way of processing grief.  I still can't even talk about my brother around my mother.", "NTA.\n\nSorry for your loss.\n\nI'm glad you added the edit.", "NTA - you found a loving new home for ash & it\u2019s your uncle. \nSo it\u2019s not like you gave the parrot away to just anybody.\nYou also would pay the vet bills & birdsit for your uncle.\nDon\u2019t see any assholeness here", "NTA", "NTA.

This is none of your mom's business.", "NTA", "You made the best choice for the bird. Your uncle likes birds and knows how to let the parrot live it\u2019s best live. Parrot will be happier and parrot will enrich your uncle\u2019s life. The fact you are covering expenses proves you wants what\u2019s best for the parrot.

But your mum is still grieving and maybe talk to her more?", "NTA.\n\nYou\u2019ve left a bird that you don\u2019t want to care for, with someone who wants to and knowledgeably can.

A win-win.\n\nalso don\u2019t put much thought into him leaving the bird in his will to you. A condition to adopt one is to have proof of having its care designated after your death listed in your will. He probably just picked you because you were the easy choice.", "NTA.  That type of parrot needs a consistent owner who enjoys caring for it.  They can literally tear out all of their feathers if they don't get enough attention.

Presumably the bird is happy. \n\nI don't see where your mother's opinion is relevant here.  \n\nI suggest when mom complains again, just say \"I'm aware of your opinion.\" and say nothing else.  You don't need to justify anything to her.  It's just none of her business.", "Your mom needs to keep her beak out of other people's business. She's birdbrained if she thinks she gets to have a say when she couldn't nest the bird herself.\n\nYour uncle's a real keeper, and you found a home for Ash. Good on you for using the money your brother left you to take care of Ash and not put a burden on your uncle.\n\nNTA.", "I am a guardian of a parrot. I was fully prepared to say otherwise, but after reading everything through, it looks like you made a good decision and tried hard to get the bird a good home. \n\nParrots are beautiful and intelligent, but not for everyone. They're messy, noisy, and bite sometimes when they're scared. They can develop mental health problems if they aren't given what they need as far as attention and time out of their homes.

You found a great home for the parrot, and offered to help out with bills.\n\nBoth you and your uncle are adults, so I can't see why this is your mother's business.", "NTA, for sure. You made the best decision possible for that bird, went above and beyond, and frankly your family should be thanking you. Your brother certainly would be, and that's ultimately what matters most. \n\n(WHEW, the title and beginning made me think you took and gave away his parrot while he was still alive and wanted it, so I was so relieved to discover that wasn't the case!)", "NTA.  Op your brother sounded like a cool dude.  I\u2019m really sorry you\u2019re going through this loss.", "NTA. You did the right thing. Your mom is probably controlling and juat has to make trouble.", "NAH\n\nI'm sorry for your loss. You're a great brother and showing a lot of care. You've found a perfect solution where you're happy, Ash is happy and you're able to give your Uncle joy without the financial burden. Your Mum is grieving atm so I can't call her an AH. But I'm sure your brother would have been happy with your solution.", "NTA\n\nYour mother is misdirecting her grief. Your brother wanted the best possible life for his beloved pet, and you\u2019ve done that. You\u2019ve also probably filled a hole in your uncle\u2019s home since the loss of his own bird. And you\u2019re putting money toward its ongoing care. \n\nYou haven\u2019t burdened anyone. Your mom is just sad (and angry) that your brother died, and this lashing out is a symptom.", "NTA.  You did what was best for Ash and are helping with the costs.  Your mom's \"I still don't like it\" response was probably because she didn't want to have to admit she was wrong, and you did the best thing for Ash.  She likely didn't know or ask who was paying for Ash's expenses and just assumed you dumped the bird on your uncle.\n\nI took in my sister's elderly cat (he's now 17) last year after she kept her promise to her sons and adopted three more kittens.  Her \"old man\" didn't handle it well and was showing signs of severe stress because the house was too insane for him (a 6-year-old and 10-year-old boy, a 10-year-old German Shepherd and 3 5-month-old cats).  She agreed to cover his vet and food expenses, which is a good thing because damn is his food expensive.  He's on a prescription diet due to urinary crystals.  His dry food costs $105 for a 17lbs bag (luckily that lasts around 3 months) and his wet food is $2.39/can (he doesn't get that as often).  His only trip to the vet was when my mom thought he had an abscess, but it turned out he just had a fat lip from the fight he'd won the night before (a neighborhood cat snuck into the backyard while the cat was out using his \"garden litterbox,\" he decided to chase that cat off before I could get to him and I wasn't about to break up a fight with my bare hands).", "You found a great solution. Ash will be loved and you are still somewhat responsible for him as you're paying for him, I assume because you've come to care about the bird as well as in memory of your brother. It's okay to care about an animal and still not want to primarily responsible for it. I absolutely do not understand your mother's position on this, and am thoroughly confused. \n\nYou're NTA though.", "NTA..\n\nWhy is it always the people who refuse to take on any responsibility are the ones who feel the need to dictate how you should handle things? \n\nI can't think of a single thing you could have done differently to assure the bird would not only have a knowledgeable caretaker and financial needs met. I'm sure he will be well loved and your Uncle gets a companion. \n\nAwesome job OP!

Ash stays in the family, goes to someone who loves birds and has experience with them, and isn't a financial burden (bird-en, huh?) to the person caring for it.\n\nI'm sure this was just a knee-jerk reaction from your mom. She might have seen it more like you getting rid of your brother's stuff, rather than a sensible plan that meets everyone's needs and wants. I'm sure she'll come around.", "NTA. Your brother left you his bird because he trusted you to make sure that he was well cared for. You have done that and honored your brother's trust. Ash will be much happier with a bird person who knows how to care for him and wants him around.", "NTA. This was the absolute best possible outcome. Ash went to live with someone who already is knowledgeable and experienced with birds, and to a home where he is very much wanted. Ash was a loved parrot who had bonded to a single person, a man. The best thing that could possibly happen for him is to go to a home with a single man who knows about birds. Otherwise, Ash would enter the bird rescue / rehoming world and that's just not a great place for a bonded parrot. As a dedicated parrot owner, I can tell you that they are a very tricky pet, and african grays are a particular challenge. It's so amazing that you had someone in the family who already knows about keeping parrots. \n\nI am thrilled for Ash, thrilled for your uncle, and relieved for you. Sorry your mom doesn't see it that way, but the true winner in this scenario is Ash. I have no doubt that he is going to have a great life. And best of all - he stays in the family!! I'm sure your uncle will have y'all over to visit with the bird any time.", "This is a repeat", "NTA.\n\nYou went out of your way to find Ash a home where he would be properly cared for and loved. \n\nNot only that, but the person you chose is someone that your brother knew, that made him discover his own love for birds; someone that Ash also already knew.\n\nNot only that, but you gracefully offered to pay for Ash's expenses; so even though you recognize that you don't want to handle his care, you will effectively paying for the care of that bird for its life. You might not be committing time, but you are committing money.\n\nAnd, last but not least, your uncle is a grown ass adult who can decide to take in the bird or not. He chose to take him in, and as you said this is someone who VERY WELL KNOWS what he's getting into by taking in such a pet.\n\nSo:\n\n* You don't have the daily responsibility of a pet you do not wish to have (but you have the financial responsibility)\n* Ash is in capable hands, he will be loved and cared for\n* Your uncle, who loves these birds, has a new friend and he does not need to worry about the financial aspect\n\nLiterally everybody gets the best case scenario. Your mother has no ground to have an opinion in that matter, let alone giving you shit over it.\n\nI think your brother would be very happy knowing that you did right by his pet by finding him a loving and competent owner.", "NTA. I was fearing reading that you had given it to a random person, but your uncle sounds perfect. Ash is still in the family and with somebody who knows parrots very well.", "NTA. It would take a lot to care for a parrot and you just give him a good home.", "NTA. I think you've come to the best solution.

Just be patient with her and hopefully she\u2019ll come around in time.", "NTA. You behaved with intention to do what was best for the bird and your brother\u2019s memory.

Maybe start thinking of a game-plan in case Ash outlives your uncle", "NTA - I think you handled it very well, respectful to everyone's wishes.\n\nI would set aside an amount that your brother left you in a separate account. Open a credit card that is only to be used on the bird, and add your uncle as an authorized user to the credit card. Set the card on auto-pay out of the sequestered account and have piece of mind the bird is financially covered. That way you still have control of the actual account as it sounds like there is some hesitation to just give your uncle a lump sum.", "NTA and honestly it sounds like you have been super compassionate about the whole situation! I also giggled at the bird thing.", "NTA you and your family are grieving and coping in different ways, you are doing what you think would be best for the creature that was your brother\u2019s pet. Although your mother may not see it like that, you still found him a loving home and even offered to take on those expenses. If she disagrees with the decisions you made for the betterment of this bird, ask her if she has a better solution. It is unfair to put that on you like that, but there is also some understanding that should be considered given the circumstances.", "NTA... you went through the process of finding the bird a good home. Well done.", "NAH\n\nI guess she equates the bird with sentimental value of your brother. I would be concerned/upset if it meant the bird could potentially fall into the wrong hands but it seems like she\u2019s not coming from a place of malice. As for you, you were honest with yourself and your capabilities with taking care of the bird. If you allowed the animal to be neglected or given to someone who also would neglect it, then I would call you an AH.

They're an incredibly large commitment and you did the best thing making sure Ash went to a loving home. Bonus points for offering to help pay for food and vet visits, but I'd also suggest chipping in for toys as well. Birds need a variety to keep themselves stimulated, much like toddlers.\n\nAlso, if you're ever in that unfortunate situation again, search around the area for parrot rescue shelters.

They require an enormous amount of attention that's different from a dog or a cat. I can see that you truly understand the reasons why you are not a bird person. And yet... you would have kept the bird and done your duty by Ash until you found the right home. And you understand the costs associated with parrots and are willing to use some of your brother's money towards Ash's upkeep. Your uncle knows the bird and likes the bird - and that's an amazing thing for a parrot whose owner has died. I'm sure you know that Ash's intelligence is about that of a 6 year old human and with more intelligence comes grief that can lead to complex psychological distress - and that usually means body mutilation for African Grays. \n\nIf you're trying to smooth things over with your mother, try this... tell her that if anything happens to your uncle, you will step in to ensure Ash gets re-homed. And that you will check up on Ash from time to time to ensure all is going well.

If she's not satisfied with that, then tough cookies. \n\nAlso, should you ever be in a position where you do need to re-home Ash again, I would be happy to help you find a bird rescue resource in your region (assuming US or Canada) using some of my parrot contacts you might not have access to.

Your uncle is old enough to say no if he wants to. Mom can but out, unless she has any other solutions.", "NTA. \n\nYou did exactly right by that smart emotional bird. I\u2019ve owned an African Grey for 15 yrs we inherited. This is what I know:\n\n1) African Greys are highly intelligent and emotional, they mourn their owners when separated. So much so that why will pluck their feathers or stop eating when grieving. Finding a new home is difficult. You found a perfect solution. \n2) African Greys live 50-70 yrs. You\u2019d have your brother\u2019s bird for at least another 30-40 probably. THAT is a huge undertaking. They are not easy to move with and you need to be home a lot for their emotional health. \n3) African Greys need a lot of care. Attention, love, food etc. your uncle sounds well equipped to do so. \n\nSounds like you did right by the bird, your brother\u2019s memory (my sincere condolences) and everyone. \n\nYour mother is probably grieving. Give her a bit of slack. She\u2019ll come around. If not, you can show her this thread.", "NTA. Your brother wanted you to look after the bird\u2019s best interests and it sounds like you did that by not only finding him a loving home that\u2019s equipped to care for a complicated and high-maintenance pet, but providing monetarily to ensure the parrot is well supported. The most important thing is that the pet is safe, comfortable, loved, and provided for. Well done.", "NTA - I used to have a small parrot, and they are very needy animals. They require a LOT of attention, and will self-harm if they don't get their socialization needs met. You say you travel a lot, and you wouldn't be able to devote enough time and energy to Ash to make sure he is happy and healthy. You spent what sounds like a significant amount of time finding a safe and loving home for Ash, and offering to pay for his care really goes above and beyond. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI understand why your mother is upset, but I think her anger is likely just misplaced grief.

I also would gently suggest you both seek out some grief counseling. You have my sincerest condolences for your loss.", "Wow you went above board to find a good home for that parrot.  Not sure what is going on with your mother.", "NTA. As someone with parrots, I would much rather one of mine go to a family member who's met my bird, has owned the same species of bird, and is willing to take care of the bird. It's a better option than giving/selling Ash to a stranger, as you won't know how that person will take care of them. A trusted family member with experience and knowledge is probably one of the best options imo. I don't blame you at all for not keeping Ash, and nobody else should either. They're extremely difficult and time consuming animals, especially such a large and intelligent bird like an African Grey. I have four parrots and I usually don't recommend owning them because they're a huge handful for most people. Overall I think you definitely did the right thing, and I'm sorry for your loss.

Your uncle is experienced and prepared for a bird, loves the bird, and you are offering to help with expenses and birdsitting. You did everything right.

It sounds like you were a great temporary home for him, but in my admittedly very basic knowledge of parrots, they need consistency and their needs are actually pretty complex, so someone who travels often is just not a good match for a parrot.

He's better off with someone who knows a lot about their unique needs.", "NTA or even close.

He has cats and if something were to happen to him I just couldn't see myself taking them in (I've had some in the past, mostly because they had nowhere else to go-but they aren't my first choice of pet and definitely wouldn't fit my life now)--but I would pursue the same avenues you did and make sure they had a good home with someone that would care for them.\n\nIt sounds like you did great by your brother--my guess is he would appreciate that the animal that brought him so much joy is with someone that will care for it as much (or more) than he did.", "NTA.

I'm not an expert and I ended up not getting a parrot, but my point is that it doesn't take that much research to know that parrots are as fickle as they are long-lived. It's not an exaggeration to say that if the owner is gone, there's a chance that that parrot will never be able to live a stress-free life again, even if they have another 40 years of life expectancy. I'm sure OP's uncle is well aware of all the variables and while it might not be the best for him financially, I'm sure he knows how intelligent and emotional these birds can get. You can't just pass a parrot around like foster care for dogs or cats. Finding a person and environment that can make an adult parrot feel at home is nearly impossible depending on your location.

They require as much attention as a toddler, tend to self mutilate when their needs aren't met (cockatoos and african greys are notorious for plucking their feathers out), they can be extremely aggressive when hormonal (my parrot's species gets extremely violent and bites very aggressively between the age of 1.5-4ish when the adult hormones kick in, then they mellow out). My parrot is extremely high maintenance. To the point I work from home and have a whole routine that's the same every day because it makes him happy. If you like to travel you can't easily get a petsitter competent with parrots. Some parrots are extremely friendly to people. Others, like my parrot (a poicephalus) only allow 1 person to touch them. My bird is smaller than an African grey but just as smart, and he has a bigger beak (he is a Jardine). Jardines have bone crushing bites and could put someone in the hospital. So I never go anywhere because there is no way I can get a sitter who my parrot WON'T bite (he likes my husband but doesn't allow my husband to touch him). My bird only gives me light pecks when he's ticked with me because he is very attached to me, but he very well could break a finger if he bit me aggressively, parrots bite harder than dogs. My entire life is planned around my parrot and will be for the rest of his life, which hopefully will be at least another 30 years. You can never own anything with teflon because the fumes kill birds instantly, no air fresheners, lots of metal is toxic to birds, they need fresh homemade chop to supplement their pellets (an all seed diet is unhealthy and increases hormonal aggression), their vet bills are very expensive.

It never goes away, it just gets easier to accept with time.\n\nYou take care of yourself.

It was fine until he\u2019d randomly decide to start flying around the house and I\u2019d need to go catch him.

Not like he gave it up to a shelter or some stranger.", "Bird.Crazy.Head.   The bird behaviorist I hired, surmised that parrots can associate certain phrases with certain locations or objects, particularly in the context of where those phrases are learned. So it wasn't surprising that a bird would make a certain sound, only in a specific location.

I had a friend with two parrots and took care of a third while her mom was on vacation.  \nI say now, with what's sanity is left: fuck parrots.  \nThe screaming, pooping everywhere, chaotic destruction, and general moodiness of these birds is just a whole bunch of nope.  \n\nNTA and well done for knowing your limits.", "In the wild, most parrot species survive in flocks.

It is very much like having a special needs toddler AND teenager with a lifespan of 15 years at minimum and up to 90+ years at maximum\n\nIn the USA, parrots are the third most popular pet, but the #1 most abandoned and rehomed. All those animal shelters you see overflowing with dogs and cats in need of homes? They can\u2019t hold a candle to parrots.\n\nI absolutely adore having parrots but I am not shy about telling people they make terrible pets for most people and unless you want to have a pet that you love so much your entire life literally revolves around it for decades\u2026don\u2019t get parrots.\n\nIf you want a pet that talks, get a radio. They are not nearly as destructive, make far less mess, and don\u2019t have the complex social needs and behaviors of parrots \n\nI could talk about parrots all day because I love them but anytime someone says \u201cso you must think everyone should get a parrot\u201d I laugh and say absolutely not.\n\nMost people are not equipped or selfless enough to take care of a parrot, even the little \u201cthrow away parrots\u201d like budgies and lovebirds are sentient highly intelligent beings with a lot of special needs and most of them meet horrific deaths after life long torture and being driven to literal insanity by the end. \n\nIf you have to ask if a parrot is the right pet for you, a parrot is not the right pet for you (at least not yet).\n\nOP NTA.

Never say any swears around a bird, ever.  When I still had Cesar in my life, a pre owned callocuan blue fronted Amazon, the only bad words he was allowed to use, were \u201cstupid bird\u201d.  We temporally had a redhead Mexican Amazon parrot with us who, unfortunately, due to medical neglect from her previous owners, and despite us providing the necessary treatment, passed away, and my dad had the bright idea to put both of them into a macaw cage together; he immediately knocked her to the floor of the cage, and while she was screaming at him, he cocked his head, looked down at her, and said \u201cgood stupid bird\u201d.

If someone wants the happiness and fulfillment of taking care of a pet they\u2019d better be prepared to handle the financial responsibilities of it as well.
