He fell in love with our uncle's parrot when we were young. He always wanted one and when he got a job where he could take care of one he got it.  \n\nDon was neurodivergent. He had trouble connecting with people.  But he loved that bird.  And it seemed to return the affection.  \n\nDon didn't like to travel. Or leave his home. Or do much besides work, play video games, collect Pokemon stuff, and interact with his parrot.  \n\nI, on the other hand, try and get out of town whenever I can. I also use every second of my vacation time and PTO. \n\nDon passed away just after New Year's.  He didn't have a girlfriend, much less a wife. He did have a will and he left me everything. Including Ash his parrot. \n\nI don't want his parrot.  Trust me after listening to my brother talk about African Grey Parrots for the last 20 years I know more about them than anyone normal should.  Including that they can live up to 60 years.  That's would have been great for Don. I on the other hand am not planning on taking care of any human children I have for 60 years.  \n\nI talked to my parents to see if they would take him\n They said their condo doesn't allow pets. I checked with the rest of our family and nobody wanted to make that commitment. \n\nI contacted a local bird rescue but they only take wild raptors. I tried the zoo. They do not accept birds.  I guess there is a chance of diseases or something.  \n\nMy brother loved this bird so I wasn't going to do anything stupid with it. Ash was actually growing on me. I was considering keeping him. Lucky for me and Ash my uncle finally got back to me.  His parrot had died a couple of years ago and since he is in his late forties he didn't adopt a new one.  \n\nI gladly invited him over to see if he liked Ash. He told me that he and his old bird has met Ash. And even been over to Don's house for a playdate before.  \n\nIt was excellent. My uncle knows more about them than my brother did. And now I have that information stuck in my head.  \n\nAsh went to live with my uncle.  I thought it was the perfect solution. Until my mom called to chew me out for imposing a bird on my uncle.  He doesn't make that much money and birds are expensive to take care of I guess. \n\nNot that it was any of her business but my brother left me a nice chunk of change. And an impressive collection of Pokemon stuff. I had already told my uncle that I would be paying for food and vet bills for Ash.  I even volunteered to birdsit him if my uncle needed and I'm on town. I know Don would want that.  \n\nShe still said that it was a bad decision to give her brother the bird. I probably didn't improve our conversation by giggling when she said that. \n\nI honestly think I did right by everyone involved.  But my mom disagrees.  I need someone with no skin in the game to tell me if I'm missing something.\n\nEdit\n\nWhen I said normal I didn't mean neurotypical.

Secondly you have BOTH ensured that the most qualified and loving member of the family will care for Ash and ALSO ensured that your uncle will not have to bear the financial burden but instead your brothers estate will support Ash the way he would have wanted. *That is the best possible outcome*. Parrots NEED companionship. You are unable, and *unwilling* to care for him, but you are honoring your brother the best way you know how. You have made a FABULOUS choice. Your mother's reaction is understandable, she is grieving and probably wanted to be able to visit Ash, she probably had a vision for Ash's care that was very important to her *because her child just died and Ash was clearly the most important aspect of your brothers life outside of you and your parents*. It's ok that you and your parents have different views of the best care for Ash, but unless your mother is ready to step up she needs to respect your decision.", "NTA your uncle is a grown ass man who knows the costs associated with the kind of bird *he's already had*.

Your mom really isn't either, I think she meant well, but may not understand that a bird is better off with someone who truly wants it as part of their life. \n\nI have a friend involved in parrot rescue, and its extremely common unfortunately that one outlives their person. It's rare a family member is willing to even try to care for the bird, so I give you credit for that. The parrot can have a better life with someone who really wants it as a big part of their life though. I'd personally never want one at all, even trying was a huge thing on your part.", "NTA.\n\nYour uncle was interested in Ash, knew Ash before your brother passed away, and was willing to take Ash.

Parrots have *incredibly* high social needs, and IMO it is borderline animal cruelty for people who do not understand/aren't motivated to meet those needs to keep them. You did the right thing by recognizing you weren't equipped to take care of Ash and rehoming him to someone willing and experienced with parrots. Your mom *might* have had a leg to stand on with the financial aspect, but since you have that covered that's not a good argument either. \n\nI think your mom is likely struggling with grief and her brain has latched onto this issue.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

That's really nice.", "NTA\n\nIf your uncle took proper care for his last bird he will do so with Ash as well.", "Unless you had explicitly said to your brother you would care for him after he was gone, then you have done the best thing possible. Pets deserve a home that wants them.", "NTA. Parrots are notoriously difficult to re-home. The fact that you managed it at all is pretty remarkable and you seem to have done a decent job. One thing to consider, do the parents consider the parrot a last link with their kid? Would visiting it regularly help with that?", "You don't want the bird, but did your best to get the bird a good home. Nobody else wanted to bother with it. And you didn't force your uncle to take him, your uncle offered. Seems perfectly reasonable to me, NTA.", "NTA,  you're fine. Mom needs to mind her own business. The arrangements you made is between you and your uncle,  period.", "NTA, and I\u2019m sorry for the loss of your brother. As someone who has a bird, they are a huge commitment and a lot of work although they are also extremely rewarding. You did the right thing looking for someone who knows something about birds to take Ash in, and if your uncle knows birds then he was a good choice. You\u2019ve not imposed on him at all since you\u2019ve also offered to pay for Ash\u2019s upkeep and to birdsit him when necessary.

As I\u2019m sure you\u2019re well aware, parrots are animals that do best when their caretaker not only knows how to tend their physical needs, but also genuinely enjoys engaging with them.  You\u2019ve taken care of the only good objection by offering to cover all the associated costs.  Ash should live with someone who takes joy in an obnoxious winged toddler, not someone who tolerates the bird for someone else\u2019s sake.  Being a good parrot-keeper requires some big lifestyle investments, and your uncle has already shaped his life around feathered companions.", "NTA. You did what was best for Ash. If you\u2019d kept him even though you didn\u2019t want to, both of you would have been miserable. I think your brother would be very happy his beloved bird got a great home. I\u2019m very sorry for your loss.", "NTA, you did what was right for the bird and your mother's ignorance of the deal between you and your uncle isnt am excuse for her behavior.

You did good, the parrot also deserves to be with someone that really wants to have them.", "Absolutely NTA. Parrots are hugely demanding pets, as you know, and keeping it when you're not able to meet it's needs would have been far worse than giving it away to someone both experienced and willing to care for it.", "NTA\n\nYou are being completely fair.  You are using the money your brother left you to pay for the bird's upkeep.  This was your mom's concern which you addressed.\n\nYour uncle loves parrots and had a parrot for a long time.  He even met Ash. \n\nHonestly, I think the reason your mom is upset is because that bird is the only living link she has to your brother.  I hope she goes into grief therapy to work on that. \n\nBecause you are absolutely doing right by the bird, just as your brother would have wanted.", "Nta\n\nNot the business of your mother, what other adults do", "NTA perfect solution", "NTA, sounds like the best possible solution to me.

So the basic is covered. If the parrot is happy there is no issue.", "NTA. It is a good solution. You haven't really given your brother's parrot away. You have found someone who will love and care for the parrot while using your brother's money to provide long-term care for the bird. Might be wise keeping that money on a separate account and giving your uncle a float on prepay credit card for emergency care.\nYour mother is interfering without caring about full facts.", "NTA -  You did everything right. You acknowledge you don't have the skillset to care for the bird, you  found someone who had experience with birds and was interested, even better they are family!

They need lots of attention and special care. She should want a good home for it.", "My uncle is way better prepared than I was.  A month and a half of dealing with Ash was already bugging me.", "I was actually a little mad at her until I read some of the comments.  I never thought about her still grieving.  I'm not the best with emotions either.  I guess I'm a lot like my brother.", "Furthermore, OP has entrusted the parrot to his uncle, who has already had a parrot, so he has experience, and OP will contribute financially to the treatment.

Greys are seriously smart birds, you have done what is best for the bird. Also truly sorry for your loss, it\u2019s never easy loosing a sibling.", "I want to.  I loved my brother.  It's the least I could do for someone who brought him so much joy.", "My uncle says he has a good bird vet.", "My uncle doesn't make a lot of money and birds like this are expensive.  She thought I was dumping the bird and keeping the money my brother left me for myself.", "It seems like you found a great solution.  I was thinking about it from the bird's prospective -- since they are so intelligent, they need a stable home with someone who really cares about and enjoys them.  It sounds like your uncle is better suited to do that than anyone else you know.", "NTA. Every YouTube I\u2019ve seen of life with parrots suggests you need a very specific lifestyle and unlimited patience - it\u2019s basically like having a feathery toddler in the house, except they don\u2019t grow out of it.", "I am really sorry for your loss. But her taking her grief out on you is unfair. It may be best to have this conversation with her that in order to give the best life for your brothers beloved animal, your uncle is the best guy to do so.", "I would imagine it is the mom's grief speaking. Her position on this particular issue is still wrong, but it's easy to imagine her deceased son's beloved pet would stir up some feelings.", "Grief, probably. It doesn't make her reaction okay, but her son did still die about a month and a half ago, which is not nearly enough time to fully process grief even if you're taking all the right steps and doing the work. Especially for an \"adult child passed before parent\" situation.", "NTA, you did very well, and (as an animal lover) I appreciate that you called the bird someone instead of some*thing*.", "I will be doing that.  A few comments have given me clarity I didn't have before.", "Especially since the bird didn\u2019t even go to a stranger, it went to a relative. Bird is still in the family.", "As a parrot owner, can I just say thank you for doing what\u2019s right for Ash? There are far too many people who would just dump a bird out in the wilderness if they didn\u2019t want it. That\u2019s how I\u2019ve gotten all of my foster birds that I\u2019ve rehabilitated. Granted, I foster small parrots, usually budgerigars, which are more \u201cdisposable\u201d in people\u2019s eyes than an African Grey, but still, people are unnecessarily cruel to parrots. You did the right thing by not only finding Ash a home with someone with previous parrot experience, but by offering to financially support Ash to ensure his continued health. In my eyes, that\u2019s going above and beyond the call of duty.\n\nYou\u2019re right that parrots are a huge responsibility. Not everyone is cut out to be a parrot owner. In fact, I\u2019d say that most people aren\u2019t. There is zero shame in admitting that you\u2019re not the right person for Ash to live with. When you take on a parrot, that is a lifelong commitment\u2014 you have to be prepared to take care of that bird until death do you part. That obviously wasn\u2019t something you were prepared to do, so instead of half-assing the care of Ash or dumping him somewhere, you made sure he\u2019s somewhere where he\u2019s safe, loved, and taken care of properly. That is a very noble thing to do, and I think your brother would be pleased with your decision. Your brother trusted you to do what was right for Ash, and ultimately, you fulfilled that duty.\n\nI do have one small suggestion, though. Take time to visit Ash every now and then! I\u2019m sure the two of you bonded a bit during his stay with you, and he\u2019s been through a rough time with the loss of his human dad. A visit from you every now and then would do wonders for him. It\u2019d also be a great way for you to feel close to Don, since he was so passionate about Ash and birds like him. You don\u2019t HAVE to do this, of course. But African Greys are as intelligent as small children. Ash will remember you, and I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll miss your company! It would be wonderful if you could stop by and catch up with him every now and again!", "NTA\n\nParrots have a long lifespan and they deserve to be loved and treated appropriately. \n\nYour lifestyle wasn\u2019t conducive to giving Ash his best life. But your uncle can. \n\nIf, whenever your uncle passes away, Ash is still alive? Maybe at that point in your life you will be more able and willing to care for an old parrot. Or you will likely step up and help find a caring home for him again. \n\nYou did right by the bird and by your brother. He loved that bird and wants it to have the best life possible.", "Nta- a commitment to any pet is a huge one. African greys have very strict requirements and of you were not comfortable with them finding the parrot a good home home with someone who is knowledgeable is a good compromise.", "NTA. She wasn't volunteering to help but expected you to just make accommodations in your life to take on a pet you don't want? \n\n\nPets need love and while I've never owned birds I know my dogs would have felt unloved and sad if they lived with someone who didn't show them affection or kindness. You were not the ideal caretaker for that bird. \n\n\nUncle is happy, Ash is happy, and you're contributing to the bird's monetary challenges for your uncle. No harm, no fowl.", "NTA, you knew your boundaries with the bird and found a place where he would be loved and cared for.", "NTA.  You mother refused to take the bird. You did not want the bird. Your uncle did and he has a lot of experience with the birds. You made a decision that was best for the bird.  If your mother is so upset, she can take the bird in.", "NTA. You found the bird a loving home, and that's the best thing you could have done. I will have the same conundrum when my parents pass. They have an African Grey that I dislike, and they are aware of this. They've made all their end of life plans except for where the bird should go. I have urged them to find a bird- loving person to bequeath her to, but they don't know anyone. I'll have to find someone myself when the day comes.", "NTA", "NTA. Not even a little bit.\n\nYou did everything in your power to make sure that this bird went to an experienced owner who had the time and the knowledge to provide high quality care. *And* you\u2019re using the money your brother left you for a purpose you know he\u2019d approve of. His beloved pet will spend many happy years with your uncle and no one will ever have to worry about how they\u2019ll pay the bills. This was the best possible outcome for everyone involved.\n\nI think your mother\u2019s anger at you is probably displaced grief.

Kudos", "NTA. \n\nMy dude, you got Ash a loving birdperson to look after him. You went above and beyond.", "NTA.  Not everyone is suited for having a pet, and by giving Ash to your uncle, and offering to pay for his vet bills, you made sure that he stays in the family.", "NTA.  You can love your brother and not want to care for his pet for the rest of you/its life.  Faced a similar issue with my brother's cat when he passed.  I am sorry for your loss.  FYI people who loved him, like your mother, may react strangely to the weirdest thing as part of their way of processing grief.  I still can't even talk about my brother around my mother.", "NTA.\n\nSorry for your loss.\n\nI'm glad you added the edit.", "NTA - you found a loving new home for ash & it\u2019s your uncle. \nSo it\u2019s not like you gave the parrot away to just anybody.\nYou also would pay the vet bills & birdsit for your uncle.\nDon\u2019t see any assholeness here", "NTA", "NTA.

This is none of your mom's business.", "NTA", "You made the best choice for the bird. Your uncle likes birds and knows how to let the parrot live it\u2019s best live. Parrot will be happier and parrot will enrich your uncle\u2019s life. The fact you are covering expenses proves you wants what\u2019s best for the parrot.

But your mum is still grieving and maybe talk to her more?", "NTA.\n\nYou\u2019ve left a bird that you don\u2019t want to care for, with someone who wants to and knowledgeably can.

A win-win.\n\nalso don\u2019t put much thought into him leaving the bird in his will to you. A condition to adopt one is to have proof of having its care designated after your death listed in your will. He probably just picked you because you were the easy choice.", "NTA.  That type of parrot needs a consistent owner who enjoys caring for it.  They can literally tear out all of their feathers if they don't get enough attention.

Presumably the bird is happy. \n\nI don't see where your mother's opinion is relevant here.  \n\nI suggest when mom complains again, just say \"I'm aware of your opinion.\" and say nothing else.  You don't need to justify anything to her.  It's just none of her business.", "Your mom needs to keep her beak out of other people's business. She's birdbrained if she thinks she gets to have a say when she couldn't nest the bird herself.\n\nYour uncle's a real keeper, and you found a home for Ash. Good on you for using the money your brother left you to take care of Ash and not put a burden on your uncle.\n\nNTA.", "I am a guardian of a parrot. I was fully prepared to say otherwise, but after reading everything through, it looks like you made a good decision and tried hard to get the bird a good home. \n\nParrots are beautiful and intelligent, but not for everyone. They're messy, noisy, and bite sometimes when they're scared. They can develop mental health problems if they aren't given what they need as far as attention and time out of their homes.

You found a great home for the parrot, and offered to help out with bills.\n\nBoth you and your uncle are adults, so I can't see why this is your mother's business.", "NTA, for sure. You made the best decision possible for that bird, went above and beyond, and frankly your family should be thanking you. Your brother certainly would be, and that's ultimately what matters most. \n\n(WHEW, the title and beginning made me think you took and gave away his parrot while he was still alive and wanted it, so I was so relieved to discover that wasn't the case!)", "NTA.  Op your brother sounded like a cool dude.  I\u2019m really sorry you\u2019re going through this loss.", "NTA. You did the right thing. Your mom is probably controlling and juat has to make trouble.", "NAH\n\nI'm sorry for your loss. You're a great brother and showing a lot of care. You've found a perfect solution where you're happy, Ash is happy and you're able to give your Uncle joy without the financial burden. Your Mum is grieving atm so I can't call her an AH. But I'm sure your brother would have been happy with your solution.", "NTA\n\nYour mother is misdirecting her grief. Your brother wanted the best possible life for his beloved pet, and you\u2019ve done that. You\u2019ve also probably filled a hole in your uncle\u2019s home since the loss of his own bird. And you\u2019re putting money toward its ongoing care. \n\nYou haven\u2019t burdened anyone. Your mom is just sad (and angry) that your brother died, and this lashing out is a symptom.", "NTA.  You did what was best for Ash and are helping with the costs.  Your mom's \"I still don't like it\" response was probably because she didn't want to have to admit she was wrong, and you did the best thing for Ash.  She likely didn't know or ask who was paying for Ash's expenses and just assumed you dumped the bird on your uncle.\n\nI took in my sister's elderly cat (he's now 17) last year after she kept her promise to her sons and adopted three more kittens.  Her \"old man\" didn't handle it well and was showing signs of severe stress because the house was too insane for him (a 6-year-old and 10-year-old boy, a 10-year-old German Shepherd and 3 5-month-old cats).  She agreed to cover his vet and food expenses, which is a good thing because damn is his food expensive.  He's on a prescription diet due to urinary crystals.  His dry food costs $105 for a 17lbs bag (luckily that lasts around 3 months) and his wet food is $2.39/can (he doesn't get that as often).  His only trip to the vet was when my mom thought he had an abscess, but it turned out he just had a fat lip from the fight he'd won the night before (a neighborhood cat snuck into the backyard while the cat was out using his \"garden litterbox,\" he decided to chase that cat off before I could get to him and I wasn't about to break up a fight with my bare hands).", "You found a great solution. Ash will be loved and you are still somewhat responsible for him as you're paying for him, I assume because you've come to care about the bird as well as in memory of your brother. It's okay to care about an animal and still not want to primarily responsible for it. I absolutely do not understand your mother's position on this, and am thoroughly confused. \n\nYou're NTA though.", "NTA..\n\nWhy is it always the people who refuse to take on any responsibility are the ones who feel the need to dictate how you should handle things? \n\nI can't think of a single thing you could have done differently to assure the bird would not only have a knowledgeable caretaker and financial needs met. I'm sure he will be well loved and your Uncle gets a companion. \n\nAwesome job OP!

Ash stays in the family, goes to someone who loves birds and has experience with them, and isn't a financial burden (bird-en, huh?) to the person caring for it.\n\nI'm sure this was just a knee-jerk reaction from your mom. She might have seen it more like you getting rid of your brother's stuff, rather than a sensible plan that meets everyone's needs and wants. I'm sure she'll come around.", "NTA. Your brother left you his bird because he trusted you to make sure that he was well cared for. You have done that and honored your brother's trust. Ash will be much happier with a bird person who knows how to care for him and wants him around.", "NTA. This was the absolute best possible outcome. Ash went to live with someone who already is knowledgeable and experienced with birds, and to a home where he is very much wanted. Ash was a loved parrot who had bonded to a single person, a man. The best thing that could possibly happen for him is to go to a home with a single man who knows about birds. Otherwise, Ash would enter the bird rescue / rehoming world and that's just not a great place for a bonded parrot. As a dedicated parrot owner, I can tell you that they are a very tricky pet, and african grays are a particular challenge. It's so amazing that you had someone in the family who already knows about keeping parrots. \n\nI am thrilled for Ash, thrilled for your uncle, and relieved for you. Sorry your mom doesn't see it that way, but the true winner in this scenario is Ash. I have no doubt that he is going to have a great life. And best of all - he stays in the family!! I'm sure your uncle will have y'all over to visit with the bird any time.", "This is a repeat", "NTA.\n\nYou went out of your way to find Ash a home where he would be properly cared for and loved. \n\nNot only that, but the person you chose is someone that your brother knew, that made him discover his own love for birds; someone that Ash also already knew.\n\nNot only that, but you gracefully offered to pay for Ash's expenses; so even though you recognize that you don't want to handle his care, you will effectively paying for the care of that bird for its life. You might not be committing time, but you are committing money.\n\nAnd, last but not least, your uncle is a grown ass adult who can decide to take in the bird or not. He chose to take him in, and as you said this is someone who VERY WELL KNOWS what he's getting into by taking in such a pet.\n\nSo:\n\n* You don't have the daily responsibility of a pet you do not wish to have (but you have the financial responsibility)\n* Ash is in capable hands, he will be loved and cared for\n* Your uncle, who loves these birds, has a new friend and he does not need to worry about the financial aspect\n\nLiterally everybody gets the best case scenario. Your mother has no ground to have an opinion in that matter, let alone giving you shit over it.\n\nI think your brother would be very happy knowing that you did right by his pet by finding him a loving and competent owner.", "NTA. I was fearing reading that you had given it to a random person, but your uncle sounds perfect. Ash is still in the family and with somebody who knows parrots very well.", "NTA. It would take a lot to care for a parrot and you just give him a good home.", "NTA. I think you've come to the best solution.

Just be patient with her and hopefully she\u2019ll come around in time.", "NTA. You behaved with intention to do what was best for the bird and your brother\u2019s memory.

Maybe start thinking of a game-plan in case Ash outlives your uncle", "NTA - I think you handled it very well, respectful to everyone's wishes.\n\nI would set aside an amount that your brother left you in a separate account. Open a credit card that is only to be used on the bird, and add your uncle as an authorized user to the credit card. Set the card on auto-pay out of the sequestered account and have piece of mind the bird is financially covered. That way you still have control of the actual account as it sounds like there is some hesitation to just give your uncle a lump sum.", "NTA and honestly it sounds like you have been super compassionate about the whole situation! I also giggled at the bird thing.", "NTA you and your family are grieving and coping in different ways, you are doing what you think would be best for the creature that was your brother\u2019s pet. Although your mother may not see it like that, you still found him a loving home and even offered to take on those expenses. If she disagrees with the decisions you made for the betterment of this bird, ask her if she has a better solution. It is unfair to put that on you like that, but there is also some understanding that should be considered given the circumstances.", "NTA... you went through the process of finding the bird a good home. Well done.", "NAH\n\nI guess she equates the bird with sentimental value of your brother. I would be concerned/upset if it meant the bird could potentially fall into the wrong hands but it seems like she\u2019s not coming from a place of malice. As for you, you were honest with yourself and your capabilities with taking care of the bird. If you allowed the animal to be neglected or given to someone who also would neglect it, then I would call you an AH.

They're an incredibly large commitment and you did the best thing making sure Ash went to a loving home. Bonus points for offering to help pay for food and vet visits, but I'd also suggest chipping in for toys as well. Birds need a variety to keep themselves stimulated, much like toddlers.\n\nAlso, if you're ever in that unfortunate situation again, search around the area for parrot rescue shelters.

They require an enormous amount of attention that's different from a dog or a cat. I can see that you truly understand the reasons why you are not a bird person. And yet... you would have kept the bird and done your duty by Ash until you found the right home. And you understand the costs associated with parrots and are willing to use some of your brother's money towards Ash's upkeep. Your uncle knows the bird and likes the bird - and that's an amazing thing for a parrot whose owner has died. I'm sure you know that Ash's intelligence is about that of a 6 year old human and with more intelligence comes grief that can lead to complex psychological distress - and that usually means body mutilation for African Grays. \n\nIf you're trying to smooth things over with your mother, try this... tell her that if anything happens to your uncle, you will step in to ensure Ash gets re-homed. And that you will check up on Ash from time to time to ensure all is going well.

If she's not satisfied with that, then tough cookies. \n\nAlso, should you ever be in a position where you do need to re-home Ash again, I would be happy to help you find a bird rescue resource in your region (assuming US or Canada) using some of my parrot contacts you might not have access to.

Your uncle is old enough to say no if he wants to. Mom can but out, unless she has any other solutions.", "NTA. \n\nYou did exactly right by that smart emotional bird. I\u2019ve owned an African Grey for 15 yrs we inherited. This is what I know:\n\n1) African Greys are highly intelligent and emotional, they mourn their owners when separated. So much so that why will pluck their feathers or stop eating when grieving. Finding a new home is difficult. You found a perfect solution. \n2) African Greys live 50-70 yrs. You\u2019d have your brother\u2019s bird for at least another 30-40 probably. THAT is a huge undertaking. They are not easy to move with and you need to be home a lot for their emotional health. \n3) African Greys need a lot of care. Attention, love, food etc. your uncle sounds well equipped to do so. \n\nSounds like you did right by the bird, your brother\u2019s memory (my sincere condolences) and everyone. \n\nYour mother is probably grieving. Give her a bit of slack. She\u2019ll come around. If not, you can show her this thread.", "NTA. Your brother wanted you to look after the bird\u2019s best interests and it sounds like you did that by not only finding him a loving home that\u2019s equipped to care for a complicated and high-maintenance pet, but providing monetarily to ensure the parrot is well supported. The most important thing is that the pet is safe, comfortable, loved, and provided for. Well done.", "NTA - I used to have a small parrot, and they are very needy animals. They require a LOT of attention, and will self-harm if they don't get their socialization needs met. You say you travel a lot, and you wouldn't be able to devote enough time and energy to Ash to make sure he is happy and healthy. You spent what sounds like a significant amount of time finding a safe and loving home for Ash, and offering to pay for his care really goes above and beyond. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI understand why your mother is upset, but I think her anger is likely just misplaced grief.

I also would gently suggest you both seek out some grief counseling. You have my sincerest condolences for your loss.", "Wow you went above board to find a good home for that parrot.  Not sure what is going on with your mother.", "NTA. As someone with parrots, I would much rather one of mine go to a family member who's met my bird, has owned the same species of bird, and is willing to take care of the bird. It's a better option than giving/selling Ash to a stranger, as you won't know how that person will take care of them. A trusted family member with experience and knowledge is probably one of the best options imo. I don't blame you at all for not keeping Ash, and nobody else should either. They're extremely difficult and time consuming animals, especially such a large and intelligent bird like an African Grey. I have four parrots and I usually don't recommend owning them because they're a huge handful for most people. Overall I think you definitely did the right thing, and I'm sorry for your loss.

Your uncle is experienced and prepared for a bird, loves the bird, and you are offering to help with expenses and birdsitting. You did everything right.

It sounds like you were a great temporary home for him, but in my admittedly very basic knowledge of parrots, they need consistency and their needs are actually pretty complex, so someone who travels often is just not a good match for a parrot.

He's better off with someone who knows a lot about their unique needs.", "NTA or even close.

He has cats and if something were to happen to him I just couldn't see myself taking them in (I've had some in the past, mostly because they had nowhere else to go-but they aren't my first choice of pet and definitely wouldn't fit my life now)--but I would pursue the same avenues you did and make sure they had a good home with someone that would care for them.\n\nIt sounds like you did great by your brother--my guess is he would appreciate that the animal that brought him so much joy is with someone that will care for it as much (or more) than he did.", "NTA.

I'm not an expert and I ended up not getting a parrot, but my point is that it doesn't take that much research to know that parrots are as fickle as they are long-lived. It's not an exaggeration to say that if the owner is gone, there's a chance that that parrot will never be able to live a stress-free life again, even if they have another 40 years of life expectancy. I'm sure OP's uncle is well aware of all the variables and while it might not be the best for him financially, I'm sure he knows how intelligent and emotional these birds can get. You can't just pass a parrot around like foster care for dogs or cats. Finding a person and environment that can make an adult parrot feel at home is nearly impossible depending on your location.

OP, your Mother is probably still grieving, and I hope that, given time, she will figure out what you did was the best scenario. NAH", "Also\u2026 did your mom say WHY she thought it was a bad idea to give your uncle the bird?", "\u201c\u2026if I ever die.\u201d\n\ud83e\udd14", "Almost nobody is good with emotions. Don't beat yourself up. \n\nI'm sorry for your loss.  I know it sucks.", "Don\u2019t let people tell you how to grieve. Everyone has a process and get to a place of acceptance eventually. From experience long story short, not for sympathy but an example. Lost mother when I was 4 (now 30). Father says I\u2019m heartless for not being sad anymore, tries to push his unresolved feelings onto me.\n\nMaybe this will help you if not totally okay. On her birthday I buy myself a single cake and I eat it happily. To me a just something small to remind me of her and celebrate quietly to myself. So perhaps, on his birthday get something small or do an activity he might have enjoyed. Smile about it. I promise it does get better but at your pace.", "While I understand the grief, it's not like you gave the bird to a stranger.  It's your uncle.", "I mean\u2026not to sound mean but why wouldn\u2019t she still be grieving? That\u2019s her child who died. It\u2019s hard to think she would be like whoops that\u2019s sad and get over it immediately. Laughing at her was kinda cruel.", "You don't specify your brothers neurodiversity, but from the description, I'm guessing he was autistic?  If so, you may not be wrong about being a lot like your brother.  There is a genetic component to Autism.", "This is why we in the field talk about neurodiveristy as a spectrum of traits, rather than a neurotypical/neurodivergent dichotomy. I don't mean to be glib, but you and your brother *have* to be of the same neurotribe, because you both got your genes from the same place. Same goes for your parents and other members of your biological family as well - when you start looking I bet you'll see the same traits popup in different manifestations all over the place", "Yes I'm hesitant to say she's an asshole, but she's wrong in this situation. Maybe just her knowing that Don willed the bird to you makes her want to \"respect his wishes\" or something... but as someone with pets myself, if anything happened to me, I'd want them to go to the best possible homes. I'm sure Don would want the same.", "I have an African grey, and she\u2019s my whole world. But I grew up with parrots, and I know the costs (time and money). I think you made the right call; parrots need tons of love and care, and keeping one out of obligation instead of letting someone experienced and willing care for them would be cruel. You did the right thing.", "NTA it seems like you found a good solution to a difficult problem. I think the best part is that you not only found someone who will live Ash but who your brother loved and who loved your brother. You\u2019re still helping support the bird and giving your uncle a pet to live with and care for that he already has a bond with. It\u2019s not like you abandoned Ash or forced him on to someone who didn\u2019t want him.\n\n I\u2019d tell your mom that you didn\u2019t force your uncle to take him and that you are going to help support your uncle with Ash but it wouldn\u2019t be fair to the bird of you can\u2019t care for him like he needs to be cared for and wouldn\u2019t be fair or respectful of your brother if you didn\u2019t do what you could to ensure Ash is given the best care possible.", "NTA. It's not about the parrot. Your mom misses your brother and probably sees the bird as part of him and when you were taking care of the bird it was like part of him was still spending time with you. It was something that she could talk to you about and ease the pain of losing a child. She wants to grieve with you and the parrot is the conduit for that grief for her. If the parrot is at your uncle's house it can't be a conduit for that grief, since your uncle isn't experiencing the same loss.\n\nIt's only been 2 months since he passed and she probably feels like your moving on faster than she's comfortable with.", "So sorry for your loss. I also just realized Don probably named his beloved parrot Ash because of the main character in Pok\u00e9mon. I\u2019m glad you were able to rehome Ash with someone who would appreciate and love him as your brother meant to.", "NTA! Seems like a great solution and you sound very respectful and thoughtful in the way your speak", "OP inherited a nice chunk of money from his late brother, though, so it would be nice to use his brother\u2019s funds to care for the bird he loved.", "I think you've done everything right. Ash has a home with someone who understands his needs and how to take care of him. Y'all have it worked out financially. It sounds like you can swoop (pun intended) in if your uncle needs a hand or a break. You've honored your brother by taking his care of his beloved bird as best you can, and your best is pretty damn good. I'm sure your mom is grieving your brother and will for a long time, and maybe this isn't how she envisioned things would happen, but that doesn't change what you've accomplished for Ash and your brother.", "This tells me that you did GREAT research, you found an EXCELLENT home for a beloved bird, and you are a loving and kind person who is taking great care of this animal, and 100% doing right by your brother. \n\nYour brother would want his beloved pet to have the best care. \n\nI have a pet bird too, and I know that if I passed, maybe my Dad would want to care for my bird, but he wouldn't be a great bird caretaker. Which is why I talked with friends to care for my bird if both my husband and I pass away, so they will take care of my bird. My Dad may FEEL like he can do it, but he would not have the knowledge to do a good job. I made a stipulation in my will so my bird will get the BEST care, not the care that my relatives might WANT my bird to have in their grief. \n\nYou are NTA, you are a loving sibling.", "he didn't laugh at her grief. He hadn't even thought she or knew she might be grieving. \"I was actually a little mad at her until I read some of the comments. I never thought about her still grieving.\"", "Not to mention that the uncle likely missed his own parrot but was being an informed and responsible pet owner by not adopting a new bird because he didn't want to leave a pet that would outlive him. So inheriting an adult parrot who needed a home helps him, the parrot, and OP while honoring Don's wishes and memory. As long as OP does indeed pay for the parrot's expenses from Don's estate then this sounds like the best possible solution for everyone.\n\nI'm wondering if OP's mom just doesn't like birds and wants that parrot out of her life.", "Yes. A very kind woman gave me a place to stay for next to nothing while I was in college. She had a few birds of various breeds. Never in a million years would I let her know that those birds were driving me insane, but they definitely were! It takes a certain kind of person to do well with a parrot, or any other bird, for that matter.", "I always say it\u2019s like sharing your home with a toddler running amok in the house with a chainsaw and a foghorn.", "Perpetual destructive 2 year old! [They have their adorable moments tho](https://i.imgur.com/5frMlPW.jpg)", "I love this!", "Please have your uncle promise to warn you if your aunt forces him to give away the parrot. I could see this happening behind your back. Not sure what your next action would be but at least you could look out for the poor bird\u2019s well being.", "Don't forget they can (and quite often do) screech louder and higher pitched than human babies too.", "I used to create \"toys\" for my parrots by drilling holes through a piece of 2x4 (or other wood), and then using those bolts that don't slip off - the ones with the plastic inserts - I could put a 4 ft. chain in the cage with a dozen bolts on it and leave for work.  When I would come home for lunch 4 hours later, all the bolts would be loose and on the floor, the wood was splinters, and the birds (Max, Fibber and Molly) would be sitting their (figuratively) doing their nails and asking, \"That all you got?  Give us a challenge\".   \n\nDon't even ask about the time Max got out and \"remodeled\" the wooden trim in the kitchen!\n\nThey take a very dedicated companion!", "Well here's a new nightmare.", "*I'ma snap yu finger if I donna get a treat!*", "With severe attachment issues. They\u2019re for people who look at a husky and think that they\u2019re too quiet, independent, and clean.", "And possibly with some [demon summoning intentions](https://youtu.be/5UUjJysUMTw).", "\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23", "A guy I worked with at a zoo had this to tell people about parrots: \"They scream loudly three times a day. Once at dawn to check in with the flock. Second, at night to say good night to each other. And lastly any damn time they please otherwise.\"", "They can also learn to swear and use it at the most in opportune moments\u2026like when your mother\u2019s pastor is visiting. Oh wait, that was the perfect moment, never mind what I said lol.", "A bored parrot will make their own fun, and that will almost inevitably mean remodeling and redecorating your home.", "I demand a parrot tax! Pls and thank you =)", "For the longest time, I had only heard parrots talking on TV and movies in that stereotypical \"Polly wanna cracker\" voice.  Then, one day, I was in an antique store and heard someone talking to me, but I couldn't see anyone, which disturbed me.  Then I realized it was a parrot- which was sooo creepy.  They're amazingly good at sounding like humans.", "It's cute when they say \"Hello\", or make kissy noises, Charlie did that too. He would also get my Nan's dogs in trouble by calling them up onto the couch in her voice!\n\nThe fact my Nan sounded like an east-end of London soap opera matriarch didn't help. He copied her voice near perfectly!", "An acquaintance of mine had an African Grey and that bird could do something that my dog would just love to, namely ask for specific treats. He\u2019d fly to his human and demand \u201cwalnut\u201c and get exactly what he wanted. :)", "I think it's adorable when they repeat a few specific phrases. Have you ever been called a pretty bird by an actual bird? It's delightful.\n\nIt gets unnerving when they prove how smart they actually are. I had a friend I used to play video games that had a parrot. It could mimic its owner's girlfriend's voice REALLY well. It learned it could yell, \"Did you feed the bird?\" in her voice from the other room for an endless supply of snacks. I swear it took him weeks to figure out that he was being manipulated by a bird.", "So a flying toddler with affixed implements of destruction.", "Well that was unexpectedly impressive", "Ah, like howler monkeys. They yell at dawn, when it is raining, and when it is not raining.", "Agreed!! the need for Parrot Taxes is strong in this thread.", "Bird mimicry is freaky! We've got a crow in our neighbourhood who's mastered the sound of like 5 different car unlocking sounds.", "Yes!", "As someone who doesn't want toddlers or birds, this is terrifying lol", "Have parrot, can confirm.", "Who is even more fragile than a non feathery toddler.", "As someone with a toddler NOPE", "Lionsgate execs reading might be tempted to make a movie out of these comments xd.", "Parrots are absolutely terrifying.
