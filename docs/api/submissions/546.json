Her birthday is Halloween and every year me and the family try to do something for her. Something a little extra like take her out to eat, get her gifts, Ren fair, etc. But every year she complains it's too much and we only act this way because it's her birthday (which yea it's her birthday we want to do extra). She says that during the year we aren't this extra with her and that on her birthday she wants something low-key since that's how we \"treat\" her. So this is the first year me and my dad are trying to be low-key. Instead of taking her out or anything we just chill at home and make her as comfy as possible with some bday gifts (mines coming late due to Amazon). But I woke up to her arguing with my dad about how she feels we aren't even trying to do anything at all for her special day. To the point that she is crying in the car with my dad while im watching my sister. I'm angry due to the fact that the one year we try to do as she asks every year we become the bad guys.

We haven't done much. We bought some Popeyes watched, a movie and so far that was it. Tomorrow we were planning to go to top golf or stay home and binge watch scary movies after I get out of my college classes and after my little sister (7F) goes trick or treating(she doesn't know that I believe). Today I called off work in case we do anything but I woke up to them arguing about the situation and gave them time to finish the argument about her birthday. Now we are all home in our respective rooms with a bad atmosphere.\n\nHelp keep the sub engaging!\n\n#Don\u2019t downvote assholes!\n\nDo upvote interesting posts!\n\n [Click Here For Our Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules) and [Click Here For Our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\n\n---\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
