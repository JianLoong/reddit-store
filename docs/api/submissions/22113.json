It's not normal to pee on the floor. Doesn't anyone notice and stop him? If he is just having accidents clothing and training pants should be absorbing most of it.  \n\nI can't imagine any parents thinking they should be spending a lot of time in the home of another person if their kid is repeatedly peeing on the floor.  Most parents would stay home until that hurdle is over or determine the child isn't ready and back in diapers.  \n\nFrequent letting loose in public?

Infants have to be ready both intellectually and physically.\nThey have to want not having pee and poop in their clothes and have developed the muscles that allow some control of their bladder and bowels. \n\nNot  every kid reaches this life stage at the same time. Many parents make the mistake of starting potty training when a kid isn\u2019t ready. \n\nEither insist on the kid wearing pull-ups at your place or don\u2019t allow him in. Or implement a sticker reward chart to reward good potty behavior (Google it they are very effective at potty training \u2014 if kid is actually ready)\n\nNTA", "NTA and your boyfriend should understand that. Potty training is normally quite a short phase though, so it's only going to be for the next few months which means your request is not unreasonable.  At this stage the apartment is still yours not his and your idea of moving in together gradually is exactly for this reason, so that you can iron out any issues caused by living together to see if it will work long term.

But the parents shouldn\u2019t expect other people to be okay with their kids peeing on their stuff. \n\nYou can always suggest a compromise and get a pair of plastic (whatever they make them out of now) training pants for the nephew to wear while at your place. They go over top of underwear and contain most of the accident. \n\nThey\u2019re actually a great toilet training tool. They protect in the short term as well as a diaper.

The parents are cleaning up everything immediately and aren't expecting anyone else to clean, but it can still cause damage to an apartment you are renting.

After that you'll have them over anytime, or switch it up whenever you guys want to all hangout.", "NTA. And obviously he isn't ready for \"big boy\" underwear if he has done this a lot.

I think keeping the visits at their house is a reasonable compromise for now. You can offer to bring over food some of the times you go there or to take them out if you don't want to feel like you are imposing.", "NTA\n\nYou don't want someone peeing on the floor. That is a pretty normal expectation. \n\nSome places are not the best place for a kid and that is just something the parents have to deal with.", "NTA.

This is nooooot a hill to die on if you see a very long-term relationship with your boyfriend.

I don't have kids but I don't remember any of my niblings peeing on the floor when training. Does that typically happen?", "NTA, but definitely get on the same page with this before your bf moves in officially. If he can\u2019t understand where you\u2019re coming from or won\u2019t let this go, then maybe he shouldn\u2019t move in.", "NTA \nWhat parent brings their kid to someone\u2019s home when they\u2019re potty training? We were shut-ins while my daughter was learning and we kept it that way because it also makes the kid feel uncomfortable. I\u2019m glad they clean up after themselves but that\u2019s really not a solution to everything.", "NTA\n\nJust be kind and gentle in regards to your comments about the little noodist. Explain how there are concerns with the lease and the landlord and all that. Let them know you adore the little guy and will happily host when they get him fully potty trained.  Meanwhile there\u2019s a cleaning sub on Reddit with great suggestions for dealing with all kinds of cleaning problems.", "INFO: Is your bf paying rent and/or utilities? Does he buy groceries? If he's not contributing, then he gets NO say about who you do or don't invite over. Even if he does contribute, it's ridiculous to expect you to be okay with this child peeing everywhere.

My husband works long, crazy hours but he\u2019s done a remarkable job being consistent and involved with all of our kids\u2019 potty training.

They invented pull up diapers for a reason.", "NTA does this kid not wear pampers?!", "NTA. Clearly your bf doesn\u2019t care about your security deposit or your place though.

Overnight or longer is a two yeses. \n\nHowever these parents seem not to care about what is happening if he's had multiple accidents.\n\nOptions: no invite again until he's potty trained or provide kid corral that he has to stay in and line it with pee pads.\n\nYou have a right to protect your new home.  If he isn't willing to compromise(you too), then it is too soon for him to move in.\n\nNo matter how quickly the parents clean, there is no guarantee that urine will not soak in and cause a permanent stink/stain.", "NTA\n\nAnd if BF doesn't understand why, don't let him back either.

Since boyfriend still has a few months to go on his own apartment lease, he can invite him over there where he can pee on floors.\n\nThe nephews parents should be mortified that their child does this outside of the home. Why is he allowed to be naked in someone else's home? Why is he not in diapers if he is not ready for big boy pants? Why is your boyfriend not speaking to his brother saying 'I love you man but you've got to get this under control before it warps the floor.'", "NTA its unacceptable to allow your toddler to pee on themselves in peoples homes.

Out of respect for your place and furniture he needs to wear a diaper. They can spend it however they want and be insulted but it's respect. My little one is potty training and will wear a diaper when out. I would not keep my child in underwear at others places so they can have pee all over.", "So you are okay with babies just peeing on your floor?\n\nThis is not toilet training.", "No no no.

Its completely unacceptable.", "This is totally unacceptable. My granddaughter is 3 and she's still learning. NEVER would my family allow a child to pee on the floor in public - they'd be wearing a pull up or diaper.\n\nTwo years old is too young and especially for boys. Their bladders aren't mature enough to hold it. He should be in a pullup until he is firmly on to peeing in the toilet. They need to verbally let you know that they need to go so at 2 he's not ready to speak up yet. Also, they usually learn to poop first as that has a fair amount of time between acknowledging they have to go and actually doing it. It's all about learning to hold their pee until they get to the toilet.\n\nI hope you made the parents clean their kids' messes. I would be mortified if my granddaughter peed on the floor in public.", "Oh no, we had to clean it. One time a regular's kid peed ON ME.\n\nThis regular was known as \"abandonment mom\" because she just let her kids as young as two roam free in the museum. Horrible parent, really sweet kids. Anyway, the two-year-old came up to me one day clutching her crotch and saying potty. I was like, I'm sorry kid but that's the outside of what I can do here. So I scooped her up and carried her to her mom. Told Mom she was saying she needed to go potty. Mom patted her pants and realized they were damp and said with zero awareness or problem \"oh! It looks like you already went potty!\"\n\nPeople would also change their kids on the tables in the area where you could go to eat lunch you brought or purchased.\n\nOur guests were borderline feral, but all in all, I loved that job.", "My favorite question!  Read up and you can join the Bot Hunters!\n\nTips for spotting bots:\n\n- I'm extra suspicious of the comments in the 3rd position on a thread. Bots seem to love it there.\n\n- comment speaks directly to the OP but is a lower level comment that OP is unlikely to see (as opposed to the original, stolen comment which is top level and will send a notification to OP, so speaking directly to them makes sense)\n\n- comment doesn't logically follow what comes before (because it was plucked at random from further down)\n\n- comment unnecessarily starts with a judgment (because it stole from a top level comment where that was necessary)\n\n- username ends with random letters or a word that is missing the last few letters\n\n- post ends with ellipses for no reason\n\n- account is around a month old and never posted until today. (Update: This is changing.  There are some accounts only 5 days old and some a year old. But having no other comments is the dead giveaway.)\n\n- account made multiple comments in different subreddits/threads within seconds of each other\n\n- post looks like it used a thesaurus and doesn't quite make sense (because it's a rewording bot using a thesaurus! ). Pronouns are often switched and fancy words that don't quite seem to belong are used\n\n- post is nothing but quoted text\n\n- post begins or ends in the middle of a sentence (often ending with a comma instead of a period)\n\n- a bot NEVER has flair (because it never posts top level comments and certainly never has the top top comment) \n\n- The best and last step is to search within the current thread and find the original that was stolen from.  Unless it's a rewording bot or one of the weird ones that copies from a whole other thread or just posts affirmations (eg \"I agree!\" Or \"10/10\" ) you'll find it and know you're right.", "Their comments are usually short, 1 to 2 sentences. The second sentence may be half of a sentence. Often the comment doesn't make sense, and frequently ends in a comma or with no punctuation. If the comment has some unusual words in it, you can search the post to find the original comment. If you look down through the popular comments, they usually steal something from the the first comment and not from one of the replies.\n\nIf you look at their profile, it's usually been created within the last few weeks. If you look at their comments, they have a bunch of comments following the formula above, all posted rapid fire at nearly the same time.", "My kid only spent a couple days in pull-ups before deciding they sucked so much it was better to use the potty. They *hated* feeling wet, having to get changed and cleaned up. I got them \u201cbig kid undies\u201d and made a deal: we stay home for a few days to try them out, and if they consistently used the potty successfully we\u2019d switch over for good. I think there was one accident early on when they didn\u2019t quite make it in time, but they were trying. Other than that, yeah, being uncomfortable in pull-ups and the desire to not have their day interrupted with changing won out.", "Yup. The key? Go really really slow when you change from an accident.  Make that activity longer and more miserably boring than just going on the toilet."]}
