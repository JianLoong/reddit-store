Since he still lives in a tiny cramped apartment that he's had since his college years we started staying at my new place most of the time.

However the nephew is in the middle of potty training and frequently pees on floors. He's peed on the floor of my apartment multiple times already and I'm getting concerned over the brand new hard wood floor of my rented apartment with my name on the lease. I've been trying to suggest that we visit his brother at their place instead of inviting them over to our place. My bf still wants to invite them over because he says we can't always expect them to be hosts.

But even if it's cleaned immediately it does soak in a little and my landlord could end up charging me for any damage.

It's not normal to pee on the floor. Doesn't anyone notice and stop him? If he is just having accidents clothing and training pants should be absorbing most of it.  \n\nI can't imagine any parents thinking they should be spending a lot of time in the home of another person if their kid is repeatedly peeing on the floor.  Most parents would stay home until that hurdle is over or determine the child isn't ready and back in diapers.  \n\nFrequent letting loose in public? Not typical.", "NTA, normally people potty train in their own home and have their kid wear diper in other places. What your bfs family does is not okay. Tell him you'd be glad to have them over once his nephew is potty trained or you are open to visiting their home or going out.", "The kid may not be ready for potty training. Infants have to be ready both intellectually and physically.\nThey have to want not having pee and poop in their clothes and have developed the muscles that allow some control of their bladder and bowels. \n\nNot  every kid reaches this life stage at the same time. Many parents make the mistake of starting potty training when a kid isn\u2019t ready. \n\nEither insist on the kid wearing pull-ups at your place or don\u2019t allow him in. Or implement a sticker reward chart to reward good potty behavior (Google it they are very effective at potty training \u2014 if kid is actually ready)\n\nNTA", "NTA and your boyfriend should understand that. Potty training is normally quite a short phase though, so it's only going to be for the next few months which means your request is not unreasonable.  At this stage the apartment is still yours not his and your idea of moving in together gradually is exactly for this reason, so that you can iron out any issues caused by living together to see if it will work long term.  At the moment your boyfriend is still on probation with you so you should get the last word.", "NTA  urine can cause damage. Even if you clean it up, it can seep between the floor boards. Why isn't that kid wearing  pull-ups? If he's having that many accidents, he's not ready for regular underwear. And what do they do when they go out in public, does he just pee in stores and restaurants?", "Mild NTA. Yes consistency is important when toilet training kids. But the parents shouldn\u2019t expect other people to be okay with their kids peeing on their stuff. \n\nYou can always suggest a compromise and get a pair of plastic (whatever they make them out of now) training pants for the nephew to wear while at your place. They go over top of underwear and contain most of the accident. \n\nThey\u2019re actually a great toilet training tool. They protect in the short term as well as a diaper. But the child has the uncomfortable feeling of being \u201cwet\u201d. Which is one of the big toilet training hurdles - pull ups and diapers are too comfortable.", "I would give this a NTA. The parents are cleaning up everything immediately and aren't expecting anyone else to clean, but it can still cause damage to an apartment you are renting. I would tell your boyfriend at least ask his brother and SIL to have you guys over until the child is properly potty trained. After that you'll have them over anytime, or switch it up whenever you guys want to all hangout.", "NTA. And obviously he isn't ready for \"big boy\" underwear if he has done this a lot. This is why they invented pullups.", "NTA - It sounds like maybe the kid isn't completely ready for potty training. It could also be the excitement of being at your place or the stress of not being at home is contributing to him struggling (if he is otherwise doing well with training at home).  \n\nI am sure his parents are not any more thrilled with him peeing on your floor than you are. I think keeping the visits at their house is a reasonable compromise for now. You can offer to bring over food some of the times you go there or to take them out if you don't want to feel like you are imposing.", "NTA\n\nYou don't want someone peeing on the floor. That is a pretty normal expectation. \n\nSome places are not the best place for a kid and that is just something the parents have to deal with.", "NTA.  A condition of them coming over would be that their child wear pullups.  It is not okay that he's peeing on your floor especially when there is such a simple solution.", "NTA but parents should have the kid wear diapers when they are at your home as guests. They wouldn't do this in a restaurant or any outdoor space so why shouldn't they be courteous at your home.", "Nta!!!! He's a human, not a freaking dog, if he isn't potty trained then he should be wearing pull ups.  \nThis is a hill to die on.", "NTA. Go to their house and pee on the floor and see if they invite you again.", "YWNBTA.  Don't they use pull-ups or anything that still catches the pee while they are learning?  So weird to expect to let your kid pee all over everything at someone else's new apartment with new furniture.\n\nEdit: Corrected judgement to Include YWB", "YWBTA.  This is nooooot a hill to die on if you see a very long-term relationship with your boyfriend.  Potty training will wrap up soon, the pee gets wiped up immediately, and your landlord is not going to know about the pee unless there are physical stains or if you tell them.  Also all hardwood floors have a barrier protectant coat on them so they aren't immediately porous - unless your hardwood floors are untreated which sounds horrrrrible.    \n\n\nRelease this.", "YWBTA\n\nHe's a kid.

This is them letting him run around pantless and piss wherever he wants. I say this because I have lived it. My brother married a piss poor mother of a wife and she let my nephew do this.
