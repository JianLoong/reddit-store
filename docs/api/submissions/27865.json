There is no logical reason to waste money and time studying for something 1. you might not finish or 2. might not pursue after graduating.", "NTA, you're providing a great opportunity for your children, but that opportunity shouldn't be confused with \"limitless choices.\" \n\nShe's a junior, she should be surrounded by people having problems making rent, people having to work two jobs or juggle children, she should be in the perfect space to be aware of her great luck. \n\nI understand changing your major, and finding yourself, etc; it doesn't always happen at a convenient time in life. But that also has nothing to do with you or your money or your generosity. \n\nBesides, she should have most of the core classes done now for her BA, she should be in a position to graduate with something, and then get a job to pay for the few niche classes per semester that she's found she really wants to do. It'll take longer, and be more painful, but ... well, that's life.", "NTA. You laid out the situation ahead of time, and generously are paying for a full university term. It\u2019s a good lesson in responsibility for her to realize you have to stick to commitments, including major, and that school isn\u2019t just fun free time to waffle around countless times.", "NTA. My parents had the same rule with me, and I have the same rule with my kids. Given how expensive college is, this is a common-sense policy.", "NTA. Your daughter needs to figure what what she wants to do rather than jumping between majors. I have a friend who did this, and he ended up with heaps of debt and nothing to show for it, as he tapped out before he finished a degree.\n\nYour daughter is very lucky to get four years of free study. If she ends up taking longer, it\u2019s hardly unreasonable to expect her to find the difference", "NTA\n\nYou have the same (extremely fair) rules for all your kids, and she wants special treatment unlike her siblings.", "If she has changed het major twice then I think it\u2019s fair. Its easy to float around in college on someone else\u2019s dime. \n\nPlus you can gift her money after graduation if you want to help with the loans\n\nIn 2023 a fully paid bachelors degree is a blessing.  She\u2019s being immature and entitled. \n\nNTA", "I guess NTA, but to be honest I thought this was going to be about grad school, not changing majors multiple times.", "NTA, she knew this when she started changing majors.  If she's choosing to be a professional student, you made it clear after 4 yrs it's on her dime.  I don't blame you and I paid for all of my own education, not my parents.  I am happy that your doing well enough to cover the first 4 yrs for your kids.", "What does your wife think? Why is Bella changing majors again? Has she shown that she is not applying herself or is she a good student? Because she changed her major doesn\u2019t mean she won\u2019t have enough credits to graduate. She will have bigger workload but doesn\u2019t mean she can\u2019t do it. She should speak to her advisor. \n\nI don\u2019t think your a jerk because you reminded her but it seems like the priority should be Bella finds success & is happy with her degree choice. She can still get this done in 4 years. \n\nIf money is your priority then Bella needs to understand how she can either graduate on time or how much it will cost her for loans. Maybe she won\u2019t switch her degree. \n\nNAH", "NTA\n\nThis rule sounds reasonable and has been made clear, both before going into school and changing majors.", "NTA part of your job as a parent is to teach her \"pursuing her passion\" doesn't pay the bills.", "NTA just because you can have the money doesn\u2019t mean Bella is entitled to waste it. I also have to wonder how much this new major is really a \u201cpassion\u201d of hers if she just discovered it and/or didn\u2019t pursue it until now.", "SOOOOO unsupportive paying for 4 yrs of Uni. Shame on you!!! \n\nSeriously, you are doing the right thing, stick to your guns. Many kids would love to have 4yrs paid for.", "NTA\n\nThe agreement was 4 years.  So be it.  I'm not saying you have to pay.\n\nI was waffling on N A H, until she called you jerks.  She's too entitled.\n\nHowever, that said, you can't expect her to know what her career will be for the rest of her life at 18 and to pick the according degree.  That's a broken part of the university system we have.  If you switch majors, it can take 6 years.  Also, if you do engineering internships, which they suggest 2 these days, that's a minimum of 5 years if you do summer classes.\n\nI'm just saying that the 4 years that worked for us in the late 1990s doesn't work the same for the school kids in the early 2020s.  Your 4 year expectation/commitment is more reasonable at 5 years these days, but it's your money.", "NTA", "Nta she knew what she had to do in order for uni to be paid for. Is this her way of skating through life expecting you to pay for it all.", "NTA - we had the same rule with our kids. We even laid out options - if you are unsure, take a semester off and work while you figure things out, take a gap year while you decide what you want, etc.  one son graduated a semester early and knows the money is there.  One transferred into a five year program. He came to us in advance to ask if we would pay for it.  He already had a scholarship that covered his living expenses, and had confirmed that it would be extended for a fifth year. Bella knew the rules going in. Trying to force your hand because you \u2018have the money\u2019 is bs. It\u2019s your money that you earned.", "ESH\u2026 not for the rule, but because you don\u2019t actually enforce the rule. If you paid for summer classes to help one graduate early\u2026 you really paid for four years\u2019 worth of classes and still gave them extra money. If you\u2019re willing to pay for a five year program, you\u2019re willing to pay for five years of school so it seems like she\u2019s really facing a penalty not for the actual time but for not knowing immediately what she wants to do. She\u2019s right that it\u2019s not fair but the fact that she expects you to pay for extra time just because she hasn\u2019t figured things out simply because you have the money is where she has AH status. Sh may just have to pack in the maximum credits per semester and take summer classes or work two jobs in the summer to reduce loans in the fifth year if you stick with the rule.", "NTA. Because you have the means, I would suggest offering to pay for the additional year but with the consequence of not paying for a wedding or a reduction in her inheritance. \n\nThe is all her own fault, but she's young and indecisive. We've all had those moments. Long term debt can really harm a young person's life. Perhaps, I'm too soft, but I would err on a financial consequence that is less harmful.", "INFO: What's the reason for the limit you've created?", "Nta this is a very reasonable condition.", "NTA. Might be an unpopular opinion on here but you don\u2019t HAVE to pay for any of it. She should be grateful that she has the means she currently has that others don\u2019t have. And I don\u2019t blame you for not wanting to pay for extra time she spends in college when she changes her major multiple times, it\u2019s an investment and it seems like she\u2019s being a bit of a spoiled brat.", "NTA. Paying for 4 years is a HUGE blessing. MANY of us get no help from parents at all, so she has had a huge leg up. \n\nIMO, she should take a gap year to work and figure out what she wants to do. It\u2019s not a good plan to continue to throw thousands of dollars at college classes hoping that something finally sticks.", "NTA", "Don\u2019t worry OP she will talk to you again when she needs money.

Bella should appreciate the huge financial gift you gave already given her. And she needs to learn that there are financial consequences to her choices.

Sure, expenses have soared, but being aware and preparing are parts of growing up.\n\nIn the end, though, you are most definitely NOT the AH. You made it clear to her, and she abused the privilege that is really not required by the parents to give.", "Very well said and spot on.", "100% the correct answer.", "Agreed. I think it\u2019s important on principal to stick to what you told her upfront, and same as you did for your other kids. Imagine how your first 2 children would feel if they found out you footed an extra $40k+ just because she was uncertain what she wanted to do. She is definitely acting entitled as coming out debt free is an amazing feat today. Plus where does this end. What about if she needs a car, gets married, buys a house. Having the cash has nothing to do with it, it\u2019s about raising her as best you can, to be frugal and responsible, and self sufficient. \n\nI also imagine you are paying for her to live at school, if possible a good compromise might be live at home and there\u2019s enough money to extend tuition to 5 years without room and board, I\u2019m betting she wouldn\u2019t be willing.\n\nAlso \u2018her passion?!\u2019 She has no idea what she wants to do. In the end major is important but I think when you\u2019re in college it feels like you HAVE to choose the \u2018right\u2019 one when in reality unless you\u2019re going for a very specific industry or grad program, getting the piece of paper is what matters most and generally learning about the industry you\u2019re interested in. \n\nYou can teach her the lesson now and always help pay off loans later if you so choose(without her knowing that possibility). Or if she has 1 year worth of student loans she\u2019ll survive.", "> Its easy to float around in college on someone else\u2019s dime.\n\nOP said in a comment that she is switching from literature to data collection. I think that is a reasonable choice given the better job opportunities with the data collection major. \n\nOP is NTA but if you can afford it, why not support your kids? If you have four, not every rule you make is going to work perfectly for each kid and it doesn't sound like she needs a fifth year because she is a party animal. \n\nOP's main concern is that she may keep delaying graduation but you could always ask her to take out loans with the promise you'll pay them off immediately as long as she graduates in year 5.", "My wife is annoyed with her, she\u2019s a B student for the most part. She didn\u2019t like what she is doing so she is changing. She won\u2019t have enough credits, since she needs to make up the sophomore classes for the new major. She is literature right now and she is jumping to data collection", "I think an argument can be made if she is so unsure about what to study maybe its best she comes back to it later in life. There is no logical reason to waste money and time studying for something 1. you might not finish or 2. might not pursue after graduating.\n\nI had this mindset and I'm so happy that I started working instead of going to university.", "Yeah, but major generally has little bearing on what your career will be for the rest of your life, and if you don\u2019t know yet, you pick a good, sensible major like a business major. I\u2019m gonna take a wild guess she\u2019s flip-flopped from art history to gender studies to ethnic studies, lol.", "I graduated college in 2013. I changed my major 4 times.  Got out in 4.5 years, and the .5 was simply because I needed a clinical internship to be eligible to sit for a registry exam. \n\n You may not know exactly what you want to do at 18, but you probably know the ballpark and credits can carry over between similar programs. For example, I thought I wanted to do nursing when I was 18. I ended up in medical lab science eventually,  which means that,  yes,  my child development courses were unused in my final degree (though I have 3 kids and have used that info). But my chemistry,  physiology, anatomy,  etc, courses were still required in the program I ended up in.  I dabbled in speech pathology for bit, and though most of the courses I took for that major didn't end up being needed, the semesters weren't all a wash, because I was also taking core classes at that time.  \n\nGraduating in 4 years doesn't mean you have to know exactly what you're going to do when you start.  But most kids at 18 know \"I like business,\" or \"I've always liked tinkering and building, I think I'd enjoy something in engineering.\"", "Parents didn\u2019t say 8 semesters parents said 4 years and summer classes are part of year between semesters.", "So they aren\u2019t in college forever and overall puts a cap on how much we spend on the kids college.", "NTA\n\nHowever, going from Literature into anything dealing with data is a good move. Maybe work with her on this move and let her know that this will not happen again?\n\nIf she was going from Data to Literature, I would have been a firm no, but to a more employable field, maybe not.", "She really should meet with an academic advisor. What career path is she pursuing? She should be starting internships this year. Sounds like she needs some guidance. Maybe you can make that a goal. She meets with advisor comes up with a plan for graduating & you will potentially consider giving her a loan. She can then pay you back without interest. \n\nWe also agreed to pay for our 4 kids undergrad tuition only. Our youngest needed to withdraw for medical reasons & it turned into a 5 year program. We paid for the extra year. It was due to injury, not academics.", "What about summer classes?  She needs some accountability (but data collection does seem responsible).", "Sounds like she should take some summer classes to make up the difference and graduate in 4 years\u2026", "Right- but if they\u2019re paying extra for summer classes, then it\u2019s understandable for a kid to wonder why extra money is ok in summers but not later.", "I'm going to go with NTA, but I also think you should consider changing your mind.\n\nFirst of all, your kids are very lucky that they have parents who are able and willing to pay for their post secondary education, and she has no business calling you unsupportive or a jerk. You are neither.\n\nBut I think if money isn't tight (which it doesn't sound like it is) then allowing them some flexibility would be a good thing to do. You already do offer *some* flexibility, but only in *some* circumstances (if they enroll in a 5-year program). Basically you're requiring that your kids already know when they enroll what they want to pursue, and then complete their studies in the minimum possible time. But college is a great time for young people to learn what they want to do, and sometimes they'll enroll in one thing and then realise that it really doesn't suit them. Sometimes they've got challenges that prevent them from completing all of their studies according to the minimum schedule.\n\nI agree that it's not good to finance their studies indefinitely so that they aren't permanent students, but if you have the means, allowing them some slack might be really good for them.\n\nEdit: I changed it from N-A-H to N-T-A because the daughter *is* being an asshole. Even if I think OP's rule should be changed, the daughter is definitely acting ungrateful.", "I\u2019m not doing that, if she changes again an extra year at least and then if she does it again we\u2019ll then we are in college for 6 years maybe 7.\n\n\nAlso I didn\u2019t force them to go to college right out of highshool, the oldest took a gab year. I expect them to stick to a decision especially since most degrees give you the leeway to change freshman\u2019s and sophomore year and still graduate on time. It\u2019s junior year at this point", "I agree with giving some slack if one change was necessary but she wants to start her 4th degree and honestly she wants a full on skipping rope not a bit of slack.", "I agree with your rule, but I'm just curious (partially because I have young kids and how much college help they get is something my husband and I have been considering for our kids): if they choose a career path that requires grad school, how much do you help?\n\nOf course, this can take many forms,  so it's hard.  There are some people who go to get a master's simply because they don't have anything better to do,  which is kind of the same thing as just hanging out forever in undergrad and being a professional student.  But,  there's also the kids who from the jump know they want to go to med school, do undergrad in 4 years and then it's on to med school.  Or even jobs where,  yeah,  your undergrad could get you a job,  but not as good of a job.  For example,  can you get a job with a bachelor's of social work? Yes.  Do most social workers have a masters? Also yes.  My husband is an accountant.  He has accountants working under him that have bachelor's, but they'll probably never climb the accounting ladder, because you aren't eligible for CPA without a certain number of post-bac credits (can be a master's, my husband is also a lawyer, so his law school counted).\n\nIf they want that kind of job,  do you support them in grad school?", "Right so I might change it to offering 5 years of financing, even if the kid is in a 4-year program. It allows a bit of slack, it allows her to change her mind, but if she does it excessively then she'll have to finance part of it herself. Which she's already done, it sounds like.", "I may be reading this the wrong way so hopefully OP clarifies but my understanding was if they were doing a program for an advanced degree that as long as they stuck with it then Op would pay for it (I\u2019m using his comment about the 5 year program as the example)", "Yeah,  that was my thought too, but I didn't know how far they'd take the 5-year thing."]}
