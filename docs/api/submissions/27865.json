That's a broken part of the university system we have.  If you switch majors, it can take 6 years.  Also, if you do engineering internships, which they suggest 2 these days, that's a minimum of 5 years if you do summer classes.\n\nI'm just saying that the 4 years that worked for us in the late 1990s doesn't work the same for the school kids in the early 2020s.

Imagine how your first 2 children would feel if they found out you footed an extra $40k+ just because she was uncertain what she wanted to do. She is definitely acting entitled as coming out debt free is an amazing feat today. Plus where does this end. What about if she needs a car, gets married, buys a house. Having the cash has nothing to do with it, it\u2019s about raising her as best you can, to be frugal and responsible, and self sufficient. \n\nI also imagine you are paying for her to live at school, if possible a good compromise might be live at home and there\u2019s enough money to extend tuition to 5 years without room and board, I\u2019m betting she wouldn\u2019t be willing.\n\nAlso \u2018her passion?!\u2019 She has no idea what she wants to do.

For example, I thought I wanted to do nursing when I was 18. I ended up in medical lab science eventually,  which means that,  yes,  my child development courses were unused in my final degree (though I have 3 kids and have used that info). But my chemistry,  physiology, anatomy,  etc, courses were still required in the program I ended up in.  I dabbled in speech pathology for bit, and though most of the courses I took for that major didn't end up being needed, the semesters weren't all a wash, because I was also taking core classes at that time.  \n\nGraduating in 4 years doesn't mean you have to know exactly what you're going to do when you start.

You are neither.\n\nBut I think if money isn't tight (which it doesn't sound like it is) then allowing them some flexibility would be a good thing to do. You already do offer *some* flexibility, but only in *some* circumstances (if they enroll in a 5-year program). Basically you're requiring that your kids already know when they enroll what they want to pursue, and then complete their studies in the minimum possible time. But college is a great time for young people to learn what they want to do, and sometimes they'll enroll in one thing and then realise that it really doesn't suit them. Sometimes they've got challenges that prevent them from completing all of their studies according to the minimum schedule.\n\nI agree that it's not good to finance their studies indefinitely so that they aren't permanent students, but if you have the means, allowing them some slack might be really good for them.\n\nEdit: I changed it from N-A-H to N-T-A because the daughter *is* being an asshole.

I expect them to stick to a decision especially since most degrees give you the leeway to change freshman\u2019s and sophomore year and still graduate on time. It\u2019s junior year at this point", "I agree with giving some slack if one change was necessary but she wants to start her 4th degree and honestly she wants a full on skipping rope not a bit of slack.", "I agree with your rule, but I'm just curious (partially because I have young kids and how much college help they get is something my husband and I have been considering for our kids): if they choose a career path that requires grad school, how much do you help?\n\nOf course, this can take many forms,  so it's hard.  There are some people who go to get a master's simply because they don't have anything better to do,  which is kind of the same thing as just hanging out forever in undergrad and being a professional student.  But,  there's also the kids who from the jump know they want to go to med school, do undergrad in 4 years and then it's on to med school.  Or even jobs where,  yeah,  your undergrad could get you a job,  but not as good of a job.  For example,  can you get a job with a bachelor's of social work? Yes.  Do most social workers have a masters? Also yes.  My husband is an accountant.  He has accountants working under him that have bachelor's, but they'll probably never climb the accounting ladder, because you aren't eligible for CPA without a certain number of post-bac credits (can be a master's, my husband is also a lawyer, so his law school counted).\n\nIf they want that kind of job,  do you support them in grad school?", "Right so I might change it to offering 5 years of financing, even if the kid is in a 4-year program. It allows a bit of slack, it allows her to change her mind, but if she does it excessively then she'll have to finance part of it herself. Which she's already done, it sounds like.", "I may be reading this the wrong way so hopefully OP clarifies but my understanding was if they were doing a program for an advanced degree that as long as they stuck with it then Op would pay for it (I\u2019m using his comment about the 5 year program as the example)", "Yeah,  that was my thought too, but I didn't know how far they'd take the 5-year thing.", "Op, my husband and I also told our two children that we would help them with four years of college expenses. I understand where you are coming from and why you are thinking like you are. Stick to your beliefs, reasoning, and principles; they are sound. \n\nI my case, however, my children are as different as night and day. My oldest earned two degrees in four years and now works in a factory (for good money and I\u2019m very proud.) My youngest, took a gap year to figure out her life and future a little. She is now twenty and has advanced in her place of employment so well that she is making extremely good money and now does not see full time college in her future anytime soon, if at all. (I am very proud of her accomplishments and of her as a person, too.) \n\nI also tried to keep money and opportunities equal between children, but sometimes it really just doesn\u2019t work out that way.

If she can\u2019t change classes at this point, have her sit in on some of the classes she would need to take and see how she likes them.
