This isn\u2019t the handmaids tale where you are forced into sexual bondage. A doctor does it and it\u2019s safe and only if the person wants to be a surrogate. I loved my experience as a surrogate. I would stay at a young age there is no reason to tell your child but when they are older you can. Maybe just agree to her crazy for now and then when your child is a teen you can tell them. It\u2019s crazy that she would split the family up just because you had someone carry your baby. It\u2019s not like you stole it. I was paid.

Your son will someday know, whether that's through family photos, casual conversation or any other incident. \n\nYou *could* agree to keep it quiet until you can explain it to your child in a way that is age appropriate and they can understand the nuances in surrogacy that range from legitimate to predatory.

There are legitimate concerns around surrogacy, but it sounds like you went about it in as thoughtful a manner as one could ask for.\n\nYour SIL is an asshole, your brother is an asshole, and your parents are assholes for enabling those assholes. When you appeal to family unity to appease assholes you're just setting them up for greater acts of assholery in the future. Do not tolerate half-measures from these collected assholes. Eff 'em.

I wouldn't want her around traumatizing my kid, so I'd be putting my own foot down and cutting them off. Who knows how she'll treat the child or spill the beans herself to try and hurt the kid when the kid does something they don't like.\n\nIf your brother is staying with her, he agrees with her. He's allowing her to hold the rest of his family hostage. \n\nWe don't negotiate with terrorists or capitulate to their demands.", "I was a surrogate in my 20s delivering twin girls for an amazing woman who couldn't physically carry her own pregnancy to term. I chose what I wanted to do with my body just as your surrogate did, especially if she was a friend in your inner circle. I became a mother very young and it was so rewarding that I wondered what life was like to struggle to materialize something that accidentally fell onto me in highschool. I chose to become a surrogate because I felt fortunate in my life and i wanted to help someone else experience the beauty of being a parent, who otherwise couldn't. It was part of my self actualization goals. While yes, I did receive compensation, it wasn't a motivating factor of why I chose to be a surrogate. Which is good because I ended up being bed-ridden and couldn't return to work until post partum. The compensation was the same amount I made yearly so financially it averaged out and gave me the ability to focus that year on the pregnancy and fulfilling my dream of giving someone such an incredible gift. \n\nSure, there is controversy around surrogacy and not every surrogacy story ends up being like yours or mine. However, I do think SIL is operating on an extreme biased opinion. Just because she doesn't value surrogacy as an option for becoming a parent, doesn't give her the right to alienate your child or try to control what he knows and believes about his existence. Her attitude and opinion could honestly hurt your son's feelings or self esteem. As a mother, I don't see that as being an adequate tradeoff merely for family harmony. Your family (you, wife, child) come first. Fuck SIL and her black and white thinking. Also fuck her for judging how you became parents instead of seeing the positive of your surrogacy journey. She can't just assume EVERY surrogacy situation is the same. NTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

The reality is infants don\u2019t percieve themselves as seperate from their mothers until around 6-7 months of age; so seperating them as newborns will always be traumatic, even if they don\u2019t remember it.

Trauma, even trauma children don\u2019t remember, can impact their behavior and development. So if they start acting out it\u2019s not that they are a bad kid - it might just be from trauma.

Even feeling strongly about surrogacy, when a family member has already had the child through this method, the right thing to do is to embrace them and accept the situation for what it is. I've had mixed feelings about how some family members have chosen around reproduction. I think it is very sad when a child will never know their other biological parent by choice of their parents. I think people seriously underestimate how much that can affect the child. However, it's not loving to act as the sister-in-law is, and it doesn't help.

Kids should know their origin story in age appropriate term from as soon as their able to grasp it. \n\nExcerpts From Ilioi et al., 2016. \n\n*When the age at which adolescents had learned of their biological origins was examined, more positive family relationships and higher levels of psychological wellbeing were found for adolescents who had been told at a younger age. Specifically, families in which parents had started the process of disclosure before age 7 showed more positive parenting in terms of maternal warmth and sensitivity, and less negative parenting in terms of conflict, as assessed by a standardised interview designed to assess quality of parenting. Moreover, families in which children had been told about their biological origins before age 7 showed higher levels of global family functioning as rated by both mothers and adolescents. Mothers in these families also showed higher levels of acceptance of their adolescent children and lower levels of control although this was not reflected in the adolescents\u2019 perceptions of maternal acceptance or control.*\n\n* Those told earlier showed higher levels of psychological wellbeing as assessed by the EPOCH, with adolescents who learned of their biological origins before age 7 showing higher levels of psychological wellbeing than those who had not been told until age 7 or older. When this finding was explored further, it appeared that earlier disclosure was associated with adolescents\u2019 more positive perceptions of family relationships which, in turn, was associated with higher levels of adolescent wellbeing as assessed by the EPOCH.*\n\n* The findings are in line with research on adoptive families which has similarly shown that telling children about their adoption at an early age is associated with more positive outcomes for parents and adolescents (Brodzinsky, 2011; Grotevant & Von Korff, 2011; Passmore, Foulstone, & Feeney, 2007; Rueter & Koerner, 2008). The findings are also consistent with research on children's developing understanding of inheritance (Gregg et al., 1996; Richards, 2000; Williams & Smith, 2010). It seems that children born through reproductive donation may be more accepting of information about their biological origins when told by age 7 before they acquire a more complex understanding of the meaning of the absence of a genetic and/or gestational connection to their mother.*\n\n* Indeed, it appears that the earlier that disclosure takes place, the more positive the outcomes for children and their parents. Thus, just as adoptive parents are encouraged be open with their children about their adoption from the start, it seems that parents of children born through reproductive donation should similarly be advised to begin to talk to their children about their origins in their preschool years.*\n\nFull research article can be found here: https://acamh.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jcpp.12667", "Agreed.. as soon as the parents acted like my kid was a dirty little secret I'd def go NC.

Modern technology permits things like making a young woman's body hyperovulate to harvest the eggs to make embryos outside a human body to blast the body of another woman with hormones in order to make the embryo likely to implant in her uterus in order to furnish an infertile couple with a baby of their choosing. It's decidedly more complex ethically, not less. Also, what about the child's rights in this situation? Are children just a commodity?", "1. Surrogacy is objectively more dangerous than typical pregnancy. A lot of surrogates (and egg donors) aren't aware of how much riskier it is. It involves a lot of the same risks as IVF (which increases cancer, risk of miscarriage, stillbirth, and other complications, including death), but when the baby is not even related genetically to the mother, it's even riskier. Surrogacy is automatically a high risk pregnancy (unless it's in the biblical fashion obv). It's also much higher risk to the baby for both death and complications.\n2. The woman who carries a baby will always carry pieces of that baby with her. It's called microchimerism and it's pretty wild stuff. Even if a baby is miscarried, that baby's DNA will be with the mother. It's unknown what effects this can have, and needs a lot more research, though mostly seems to be beneficial to the mother.\n3. A baby is adapted to the voice, heartbeat, etc, of its mother. Adopted babies have a harder adjustment and higher risk of SIDS (among other things) due to this separation from the woman who carried them. It's harder for babies to regulate their nervous and cardiovascular systems with adults who are not their mother and father. Bonding with the 'new' (to the baby) parents can help mitigate this, but it's always going to be harder on the baby than otherwise. \n\nIt's ultimately not my decision to make, obviously, but people need to be aware that hearing that 'some surrogates love surrogacy!' is very far from the whole picture. Also, again, note who you are focusing on: 'it helps some couples.' Does it help the baby? Is it good for the baby or the surrogate or the egg donor? These are the questions that people who have qualms with surrogacy are asking. Is it ethical to give a college age woman ovarian cancer in order to harvest her eggs so an infertile woman can have a baby? Is it ethical to choose to have a baby conceived to intentionally separate that baby from the woman who bore him, knowing the drawbacks and potential trauma this can cause? It's not an easy set of questions to answer.", "Totally read that wrong.

You can\u2019t choose the family you were born into or their extended family, but you can make you a new healthy family with you, your spouse and son and who ever else you deem worthy of you guys precious love. It is definitely not the family you have now. Stand up for your son, he deserves unconditional love from everyone. Start going to the local senior center and volunteer, their are plenty of seniors in there that would love to grandparents-in-love. I know this hurts because you believe you guys are a close knit family, they are close knit with each other, you guys are excluded unless you bend to what they deem is right for you guys.", "Nta. Does she think you should have just not had children or adopted? Adoption can be extremely expensive, and a mutual agreement surogget can be far easier to deal with.", "NTA. Wtf is this being against surrogates? What a dumb take. \n\nI\u2019m dealing with infertility myself and after many talks, and our options be presented, my husband and did double known donors, his twin sister for eggs, my brother for sperm, and I\u2019m carrying our baby. We went to our parents first and had nothing but support. Science is really fucking cool, and the fact that these things exist today is really cool. What a weird hill to die on that you can\u2019t tell them you used a surrogate. I\u2019m also so sorry to you and your wife, I know the feelings of insecurity that come with making the choice of donors or surrogates and I just can\u2019t imagine having s family judge me for that decision.", "NTA- it\u2019s not something that should be kept a secret, nor is it in any way shameful.

Her unhinged views are top-notch, though...", "NTA-\n\nYour SIL is a lunatic", "What\u2019s wrong with using a surrogate?", "Awesome response! Here\u2019s a poor man\u2019s medal \ud83c\udfc5", "The only way surrogacy exploits and objectifies women is if it is forced. Like if you kidnapped and her and forced her to bear your babies.  As long as everything is consentual the SIL's argument does not hold up or make any sense. Saying that a woman should not be allowed to perform this service for someone, either for compensation or as a favour, takes away a women's agency and right to decide what she does with her own body.\n\nI think SIL has watched too much Handmaid's Tale.\n\nForgot judgement NTA", "I knew someone who did it because it paid out the nose and she got absolutely top notch medical care for free. It's incredibly one-sided of you to say this kind of shit.", "She is making like 7 different leaps to get to that conclusion. There are all sorts of scary and bad things that might (and some will) happen to her daughter in her lifetime. So what if she successfully makes her own immediate family a \"we-don't-talk-about-surrogacy\" zone, how is her daughter protected from everyone else in her life? Her future friends, roommates, romantic partners, in-laws? Can SIL find all those people now and make sure they are ALSO growing up ignorant of any surrogacy stories with happy endings? Even if her fear is reasonable, her response to it is not. \n\nMuch better to raise her daughter to value, love, and respect herself, teach her daughter how to set firm and healthy boundaries, and the odds that someone will be able to talk her into surrogacy (or any number of other things) when she doesn't actually want to are pretty close to none.", "I'm sorry you think it's okay that your friend's body was used to carry a child for money.", "Why are you not in favor of surrogacy? I'm curious. I didn't even fully understand it at the beginning of this, but my view is \"where is the harm?\" \nThe only harm here I'm seeing is the SIL, and to a lesser extent the brother by swirling DNA with batshit crazy.", "i think that\u2019s how most modern surrogates are, they\u2019re women who chose to carry children for people who cannot. And SIL is being just as obtuse for objectifying women who CHOOSE to be surrogates for friends, family, or just because they want to. Like she\u2019s been drinking the kool-aid of crazy, almost like conspiracy surrogacy stories. \n\nfeminism is about people having the right to choose for themselves and surrogates choose to use their bodies in this way because they can. SIL needs to mind her own business and stop policing other peoples bodies", "There are women in the US who enjoy being pregnant and choose to offer their love to others who are unable to carry a pregnancy.", "I wonder what a desperate third world woman would think about your comment. For her it might be an opportunity to safe the lives of her children. Just a thought.", "The only reason I personally see, using women from undeveloped countries aside, is that's a legal minefield.\nEspecially if anything goes wrong. Also, legally a surrogate is a mother and if she changes her mind there would a long legal battle.", "There are cases of the intended parents rejecting the child for various reasons too. There\u2019s a case from 2014 where a baby got rejected because they were born with a disability but the parents took home the healthy twin. There are also people who get pregnant on their own and don\u2019t want the surrogate baby anymore. There\u2019s a lady on tiktok who was a surrogate during the lockdowns and now she\u2019s raising the twins because the intended parents never came for them. It\u2019s really hard on the surrogates because they end up being legally responsible for the kids.", "That can happen with any kid, no matter how they were conceived.", "That was very kind of you. What an amazing and thoughtful gift.", "I agree. What do you say when someone is expecting a baby when you think it's a bad idea? \"Congratulations!\"", "Right?? The SIL is treating it like they went full Handmaid\u2019s tale and bought some kind of slave woman. They had a WILLING surrogate. The sil is nuts.", "The SIL thinks she\u2019s so progressive she\u2019s ended up on the other side trying to control another woman\u2019s body. \n\nYes we are aware of the issues with surrogacy especially in developing countries. But OP went about it thoughtfully and found a friend and had a great experience.

If two people have a ten dollars and one of them gives the money  to a friend, is the other one expected to? No, it\u2019s a choice that individuals make for their own reasons.", "The best way to push back on that is to ask her whether she has any faith in her own ability to instill the sense of self-confidence and the tools for self-advocacy in her daughter that will teach her to stand up for her own beliefs.\n\nIs she planning to protect her daughter by shielding her from the world? Or is she planning to protect her daughter by teaching her that she has rights, that she is a person whose wants and needs matter, and how to advocate for herself in the face of adversity?\n\nThe best way to protect women from being objectified is to teach them to make choices and stand up for them. The friend who acted as a surrogate for your son made the choice *she* wanted to make, and you would have stood up for that choice whether it was the answer you wanted or not-- and you're aghast that your SIL isn't respecting that a woman made a choice she believed in, just because it's the choice your SIL wouldn't have made herself. Unless your SIL believes women don't *really* deserve bodily autonomy?\n\nConsider this: \"So what if someone calls her unreasonable and selfish? She's a girl, she's going to go through her entire LIFE being told she's unreasonable and selfish for one reason or another. You can't protect her from that. Your job is to teach her how to stand up against that, and how to recognize when she's being pressured or exploited, not to act as a shield for her.  Unless you don't think your own daughter will grow up to be a person who can speak her mind and stand for herself?\"\n\nThe only way her daughter will wind up being an unwilling surrogate is if she's shielded and sheltered and taught that her thoughts/feelings/needs don't matter. If she isn't given the tools to speak up and stand up. That places the responsibility on her *parents* to prepare her for the world. It is *not* your responsibility, or the world's, to fold to the whim of her parents. \n\nIf anything, this should be an incredible *teachable moment* for her daughter when she's older, because it could open up some great dialogue on how women are in control of their bodies and get to make their own choices. \"This woman chose to help give birth to [daughter's] cousin. She didn't have to, but she wanted to. She could have said no, and [cousin's parents (you and your wife)] are very lucky she said yes.\" There's a lot of ways to emphasize and reinforce the idea that surrogacy is a choice women should get to make at their behest, as a part of reinforcing respect for women's bodily autonomy.", "As for pushback, I'd inform SIL that it's her job to teach her daughter that what she wants to do with her body is her choice and that she can't let societal pressures affect her comfortability in making the choices that are right for her. Whether it be surrogacy, abortion, sex in general, what she wears, etc. As parents we can't always control the outside world so it's best to instill the value itself into the child and help them be confident in making strong decisions for themselves.", "99% of the time, women are \u201cwilling\u201d to be a surrogate which is putting their life at risk and following every rules set by the couple whose baby is put in her womb to earn money.\n\nwhen that \u201cconsent\u201d is because of money, it\u2019s not consensual. consent cannot be bought.", "What the shit?

Oh my god.  It's definitely a thing.  Why \\*wouldn't\\* mankind take a wholesome, life-affirming thing and turn it into a for-profit mockery, like a fucking puppy mill?  Ugh.", "I'm sorry you think women are commodities.", "They will, because they view SIL's kid as the 'proper' grandchild since she's the one that was the result of 'old fashioned' PIV sex within marriage.", "I think they were saying this _was_ an example of that, because Op and their partner found a friend who was willing to be a surrogate.", "Eh.\n\nAnytime there's an economic differential between two groups of people, it will always end up being the case that that the wealthier group offers the poorer group compensation for performing _some_ sort of action.\n\nIts just that western civilization has made the decision to say that paying people for their time is OK so long as the actions they are engaged to perform doesn't involve a 5\"x5\" area of their bodies located in their groins. \n\nRealistically speaking, what the fuck is the difference between engaging someone to spend 8 hours moving their arms in a certain way to lift and place objects on a truck, and paying someone to place their genitals at your disposal, either for penetrative sex, or for surrogacy? The only difference is that significance that we've _chosen_ to ascribe to our genitals.

Because a woman CHOOSING to be a surrogate (free of medical and financial pursuasions) is her choice. YOU are the one who is talking as if women shouldn't have the final say over her own body. Honestly fuck it's not 1950, women should have agency over their own bodies", "Okay, but consider that she should already have free access to good healthcare and she should already be able to have enough money to live comfortably.

No fertile woman is obliged to carry any child, not even her own. Vulnerable women should never be pressured into it obviously. But any woman with any self esteem would just say no. Surely she doesn't think her own child would actually be so lacking in self worth?\n\nShe is saying that the woman who choose to be surrogates, the ones that clearly are not vulnerable, are incapable of making a decision for themselves. They are clearly feeble and need people like her to tell them what to do. \n\nThat isn't feminism. We want women to be able to make their own decisions against a background of laws that protect vulnerable people.", "How does this make sense as a comparison?", "And honestly in a just world would have won two.

Get a grip.", "In my comment i literally specified surrogacy is ethical when  a woman is comfortable both financially and medically. Where did I say otherwise", "NTA \n\nOkay so, being a surrogate is *a voluntary choice* in (I believe) literally every case. It is NOT \"treating women like objects\" to use a WILLING surrogate. A service was rendered, that the surrogate was likely compensated for. There is NO REASON for ANYONE to be \"uncomfortable\" with the circumstances of your son's birth, unless they're AHs that think using a surrogate makes him \"less than\" compared to a pregnancy sustained by a member of the family.\n\nI'm willingly child free, but in a hypothetical situation like this, it would be grounds for me to cut the family right out of my life. No one needs that sort of negativity around *their kid.* I get that it might cause short term hurt (\"why don't I have grandparents/cousins/etc like all my friends\" or some such) but in the long term it will likely be WAY better for your son.", "I don\u2019t understand how surrogacy for fertility issues is treating a woman as an object when it was a friend of yours who agreed to be a surrogate.

As nice as it would be for him to have a relationship with his cousin and aunt and uncle, it\u2019s nothing that some good friendships from kids clubs can\u2019t replace.
