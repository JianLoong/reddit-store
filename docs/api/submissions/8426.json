This isn\u2019t the handmaids tale where you are forced into sexual bondage. A doctor does it and it\u2019s safe and only if the person wants to be a surrogate. I loved my experience as a surrogate. I would stay at a young age there is no reason to tell your child but when they are older you can. Maybe just agree to her crazy for now and then when your child is a teen you can tell them. It\u2019s crazy that she would split the family up just because you had someone carry your baby. It\u2019s not like you stole it. I was paid.

Your son will someday know, whether that's through family photos, casual conversation or any other incident. \n\nYou *could* agree to keep it quiet until you can explain it to your child in a way that is age appropriate and they can understand the nuances in surrogacy that range from legitimate to predatory.

There are legitimate concerns around surrogacy, but it sounds like you went about it in as thoughtful a manner as one could ask for.\n\nYour SIL is an asshole, your brother is an asshole, and your parents are assholes for enabling those assholes. When you appeal to family unity to appease assholes you're just setting them up for greater acts of assholery in the future. Do not tolerate half-measures from these collected assholes. Eff 'em.

I wouldn't want her around traumatizing my kid, so I'd be putting my own foot down and cutting them off. Who knows how she'll treat the child or spill the beans herself to try and hurt the kid when the kid does something they don't like.\n\nIf your brother is staying with her, he agrees with her. He's allowing her to hold the rest of his family hostage. \n\nWe don't negotiate with terrorists or capitulate to their demands.", "I was a surrogate in my 20s delivering twin girls for an amazing woman who couldn't physically carry her own pregnancy to term. I chose what I wanted to do with my body just as your surrogate did, especially if she was a friend in your inner circle. I became a mother very young and it was so rewarding that I wondered what life was like to struggle to materialize something that accidentally fell onto me in highschool. I chose to become a surrogate because I felt fortunate in my life and i wanted to help someone else experience the beauty of being a parent, who otherwise couldn't. It was part of my self actualization goals. While yes, I did receive compensation, it wasn't a motivating factor of why I chose to be a surrogate. Which is good because I ended up being bed-ridden and couldn't return to work until post partum. The compensation was the same amount I made yearly so financially it averaged out and gave me the ability to focus that year on the pregnancy and fulfilling my dream of giving someone such an incredible gift. \n\nSure, there is controversy around surrogacy and not every surrogacy story ends up being like yours or mine. However, I do think SIL is operating on an extreme biased opinion. Just because she doesn't value surrogacy as an option for becoming a parent, doesn't give her the right to alienate your child or try to control what he knows and believes about his existence. Her attitude and opinion could honestly hurt your son's feelings or self esteem. As a mother, I don't see that as being an adequate tradeoff merely for family harmony. Your family (you, wife, child) come first. Fuck SIL and her black and white thinking. Also fuck her for judging how you became parents instead of seeing the positive of your surrogacy journey. She can't just assume EVERY surrogacy situation is the same. NTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

The reality is infants don\u2019t percieve themselves as seperate from their mothers until around 6-7 months of age; so seperating them as newborns will always be traumatic, even if they don\u2019t remember it.

Trauma, even trauma children don\u2019t remember, can impact their behavior and development. So if they start acting out it\u2019s not that they are a bad kid - it might just be from trauma.

Even feeling strongly about surrogacy, when a family member has already had the child through this method, the right thing to do is to embrace them and accept the situation for what it is. I've had mixed feelings about how some family members have chosen around reproduction. I think it is very sad when a child will never know their other biological parent by choice of their parents. I think people seriously underestimate how much that can affect the child. However, it's not loving to act as the sister-in-law is, and it doesn't help.

They didn\u2019t take advantage of anyone, lol.", "NTA. It sounded to me like she was so jealous of you having a baby, she decided then and there she was against surrogacy. This entire conflict is her problem. She's making this a huge drama because she wants to. Good mothers protect peace, they foster family ties. Her behavior is downright hateful. Stick to your guns, keep your dignity. Don't play her games.

That's also part of the ethical issues.", "Probably his aunt - or cousin, given she seems to be pushing the same views onto her own daughter.", "Tell your son as soon as possible.

I know it's easier said than done but this is unhinged behavior.", "So according to her, same sex couples don\u2019t deserve to have biological children? \n\nYour son has a right to know his origins if you want to tell him. You should let your parents and brother-in-law know that her beliefs are her beliefs, but you are not letting *her* beliefs influence how you raise *your* son.\n\nYou said your parents were disappointed with your decision to use a surrogate. Do they view your son as lesser than your niece because she was conceived naturally?", "Cite your repeated research \nOtherwise it's just an opinion", "I understand and I apologize for reading far too much into it. She\u2019s still incredibly cruel, irrational and far too invested and judgmental of your son and how you and your wife chose to grow your family. You should stand firm with your wife and son. \n\nShe makes it seems as though his surrogacy seems some dirty shameful secret.

If the concern from SIL is that the method in question of making a baby can be abused, nobody would ever have a baby again, because they can all be abused.", "What a gift to give a friend! Of course there are lots of exploitative ways to do it, but to cheapen that gift by saying you\u2019re treating the woman like an object\u2026that\u2019s pretty low.\n\nAnd if it was done through reputable organizations, the friend has been pregnant before. She had a very clear idea of what that sacrifice would be, and she still chose it. CHOSE it.

Everyone seems to forget about the actual product being exchanged- a living, breathing human child. What's it usually called when people are exchanged as a product?", "The minority of women who do it so it purely for the joy of being pregnant. It is not sexist to say that the majority of women who are surrogates did so for financial reasons, which is an unethical position to put someone in. \n\nStripping is not the same as renting your organs. It\u2019s not erasing their agency for gods sake, it\u2019s giving them MORE, it\u2019s saying a woman should do that purely because she chooses to not because she is financially coerced to.

The surrogate agrees and is compensated for her medical costs, and maybe extra, depending on the contract with the family.  Some surrogacy pregnancies have the couple's egg and sperm fertilized so the surrogate doesn't have any DNA relation with the child, some it is the surrogate egg....again depending on the situation.  Most surrogates who do this actually like it and some do it multiple times, they don't seem to think that they are being objectified, they think they are doing a good thing for a couple.", "That's my concern, telling him  early in an appropriate way and you remove the weapon.  The other option is go NC but OP doesn't sound like they are ready for that.", "I understand where you're coming from, but I would agree it's best to tell the child early so it's just a (fairly unimportant) part of his life, not something dropped on him at 16 or 17.\n\nAnd it's more important here where it's become a Whole Thing. Because there's enough strong feelings about it that if he doesn't get told about it without any drama, someday he's going to learn it via Big Drama. And that will do no-one any good.", "They don't have to get into trouble for it to be shameful and sad.

Yes, bad things can be done under the guise of surrogacy, but this person's case is not one of them.", "I have never said you shouldn\u2019t be ALLOWED to do anything.
