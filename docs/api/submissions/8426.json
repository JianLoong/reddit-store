Do people not understand that women opt to be surrogates and many are married, have families, and do it to make extra money and help others? It's rarely a single woman who has never had kids as a surrogate. Unless you went to a foreign country like Colombia to get one, I don't see an issue.", "Wow as a person who was a surrogate three times, your sister in law has some really backwards views. This isn\u2019t the handmaids tale where you are forced into sexual bondage. A doctor does it and it\u2019s safe and only if the person wants to be a surrogate. I loved my experience as a surrogate. I would stay at a young age there is no reason to tell your child but when they are older you can. Maybe just agree to her crazy for now and then when your child is a teen you can tell them. It\u2019s crazy that she would split the family up just because you had someone carry your baby. It\u2019s not like you stole it. I was paid. Don\u2019t know if your surrogate was free because of a friend. But both people are being compensated so no one is feeling like they are being used or anything.", "NTA. Honestly, if someone is objectifying women, it's your SIL.\n\nA woman can do whatever she wants with her own body. Your surrogate was a willing, consenting adult and the fact that your SIL wants to tell her how to handle her own body is gross.", "NTA is unhinged and should've been told to fuck right off.  You using a surrogate literally doesn't affect her nor is it her business.", "NTA. Please do not give in to this craziness. :\"Women as objects\" because you used a surrogate? It's not like you went to a third world country and paid a destitute woman more money than she could say no to to have your baby. SIL is ridiculous and under no circumstances should you lie to your son or ANYONE else to protect her idiocy.", "SIL is nuts.

Sad sad situation.", "NTA Your SIL sounds like the sort of person you should keep your son away from until he grows up.", "NTA. Of course you don't owe anything to SIL, including whether or not your son will be told. I wouldn't fault you for lying to her in order to keep peace, but I'd also understand being principled with that, because that relationship doesn't seem worth salvaging, even for your son to have a cousin.\n\nThat said, I understand concerns with surrogacy to a point, but you found a friend who was willing to do this for you. You didn't \"hire a womb\" or whatever the \"seeing women as property\" argument is. This is not much different than adopting a friend's child.", "NTA. Your SIL is insane.

Your son will someday know, whether that's through family photos, casual conversation or any other incident. \n\nYou *could* agree to keep it quiet until you can explain it to your child in a way that is age appropriate and they can understand the nuances in surrogacy that range from legitimate to predatory. But that's a choice you need to make.", "NTA. Your kid has a right to know the truth more than another relative has the 'right' to suppress it. \n\nSurrogacy is controversial for a lot of reasons. But not all surrogacy is the same. It sounds like you had a friend who altruistically offered to be a gestational carrier. There is nothing remotely unethical about that. It's sweet and life-affirming. This person acted out of their desire to help you, not because they were coerced in any way shape or form. Objecting to consenting adults producing a wanted child is as stupid as objecting to someone's choice of contraception or life partner. It is none of her business.", "NTA.

And explain to your parents, you refuse to put them in the position of lying to your son also.\n * If SIL keeps her kid away, one day the child will grow up and want to know why.

I'm sure it will be seen as a betrayal and he will probably have trust issues if you don't tell him - the same as not telling a kid they're adopted - but I'm neither of those things so what do I know.\n\nYour family are mega-assholes for demanding your child never find out - and you will be an AH for not telling him for family harmony. NTA.", "NTA\n\nIt's none of her f'ing business.  Not one little bit.  \n\nI do hope that you wait till he's an adult though and can understand why you did what you did.  But that's your kid just because his gestation was in a different body doesn't make him any less family or yours.  \n\nSounds like she is woke to the point of delusional....", "NTA - I hate stupidly strong viewpoints on topics without considering all the facts and your SIL is typically thinking like that.\n\nI'd advise to accept it, though. Do it for the children, not for the other asshats that try to control narrative and truth to fit what they think is \"right\".\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThey will know one way or another, at some point.

There are legitimate concerns around surrogacy, but it sounds like you went about it in as thoughtful a manner as one could ask for.\n\nYour SIL is an asshole, your brother is an asshole, and your parents are assholes for enabling those assholes. When you appeal to family unity to appease assholes you're just setting them up for greater acts of assholery in the future. Do not tolerate half-measures from these collected assholes. Eff 'em. Your son is better off not exposed to them than he is having a cousin (who is living amongst the assholes, and learning their asshole ways).", "NTA\n\nShe's wacko. I wouldn't want her around traumatizing my kid, so I'd be putting my own foot down and cutting them off. Who knows how she'll treat the child or spill the beans herself to try and hurt the kid when the kid does something they don't like.\n\nIf your brother is staying with her, he agrees with her. He's allowing her to hold the rest of his family hostage. \n\nWe don't negotiate with terrorists or capitulate to their demands.", "I was a surrogate in my 20s delivering twin girls for an amazing woman who couldn't physically carry her own pregnancy to term. I chose what I wanted to do with my body just as your surrogate did, especially if she was a friend in your inner circle. I became a mother very young and it was so rewarding that I wondered what life was like to struggle to materialize something that accidentally fell onto me in highschool. I chose to become a surrogate because I felt fortunate in my life and i wanted to help someone else experience the beauty of being a parent, who otherwise couldn't. It was part of my self actualization goals. While yes, I did receive compensation, it wasn't a motivating factor of why I chose to be a surrogate. Which is good because I ended up being bed-ridden and couldn't return to work until post partum. The compensation was the same amount I made yearly so financially it averaged out and gave me the ability to focus that year on the pregnancy and fulfilling my dream of giving someone such an incredible gift. \n\nSure, there is controversy around surrogacy and not every surrogacy story ends up being like yours or mine. However, I do think SIL is operating on an extreme biased opinion. Just because she doesn't value surrogacy as an option for becoming a parent, doesn't give her the right to alienate your child or try to control what he knows and believes about his existence. Her attitude and opinion could honestly hurt your son's feelings or self esteem. As a mother, I don't see that as being an adequate tradeoff merely for family harmony. Your family (you, wife, child) come first. Fuck SIL and her black and white thinking. Also fuck her for judging how you became parents instead of seeing the positive of your surrogacy journey. She can't just assume EVERY surrogacy situation is the same. NTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
