This isn\u2019t the handmaids tale where you are forced into sexual bondage. A doctor does it and it\u2019s safe and only if the person wants to be a surrogate. I loved my experience as a surrogate. I would stay at a young age there is no reason to tell your child but when they are older you can. Maybe just agree to her crazy for now and then when your child is a teen you can tell them. It\u2019s crazy that she would split the family up just because you had someone carry your baby. It\u2019s not like you stole it. I was paid. Don\u2019t know if your surrogate was free because of a friend. But both people are being compensated so no one is feeling like they are being used or anything.", "NTA.

You using a surrogate literally doesn't affect her nor is it her business.", "NTA. Please do not give in to this craziness. :\"Women as objects\" because you used a surrogate? It's not like you went to a third world country and paid a destitute woman more money than she could say no to to have your baby.

Of course you don't owe anything to SIL, including whether or not your son will be told.

Your son will someday know, whether that's through family photos, casual conversation or any other incident. \n\nYou *could* agree to keep it quiet until you can explain it to your child in a way that is age appropriate and they can understand the nuances in surrogacy that range from legitimate to predatory. But that's a choice you need to make.", "NTA. Your kid has a right to know the truth more than another relative has the 'right' to suppress it. \n\nSurrogacy is controversial for a lot of reasons.

It's sweet and life-affirming. This person acted out of their desire to help you, not because they were coerced in any way shape or form. Objecting to consenting adults producing a wanted child is as stupid as objecting to someone's choice of contraception or life partner. It is none of her business.", "NTA.

And explain to your parents, you refuse to put them in the position of lying to your son also.\n * If SIL keeps her kid away, one day the child will grow up and want to know why.

I'm sure it will be seen as a betrayal and he will probably have trust issues if you don't tell him - the same as not telling a kid they're adopted - but I'm neither of those things so what do I know.\n\nYour family are mega-assholes for demanding your child never find out - and you will be an AH for not telling him for family harmony.

Do it for the children, not for the other asshats that try to control narrative and truth to fit what they think is \"right\".\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThey will know one way or another, at some point.

There are legitimate concerns around surrogacy, but it sounds like you went about it in as thoughtful a manner as one could ask for.\n\nYour SIL is an asshole, your brother is an asshole, and your parents are assholes for enabling those assholes. When you appeal to family unity to appease assholes you're just setting them up for greater acts of assholery in the future. Do not tolerate half-measures from these collected assholes. Eff 'em. Your son is better off not exposed to them than he is having a cousin (who is living amongst the assholes, and learning their asshole ways).", "NTA\n\nShe's wacko. I wouldn't want her around traumatizing my kid, so I'd be putting my own foot down and cutting them off. Who knows how she'll treat the child or spill the beans herself to try and hurt the kid when the kid does something they don't like.\n\nIf your brother is staying with her, he agrees with her. He's allowing her to hold the rest of his family hostage. \n\nWe don't negotiate with terrorists or capitulate to their demands.", "I was a surrogate in my 20s delivering twin girls for an amazing woman who couldn't physically carry her own pregnancy to term. I chose what I wanted to do with my body just as your surrogate did, especially if she was a friend in your inner circle. I became a mother very young and it was so rewarding that I wondered what life was like to struggle to materialize something that accidentally fell onto me in highschool. I chose to become a surrogate because I felt fortunate in my life and i wanted to help someone else experience the beauty of being a parent, who otherwise couldn't. It was part of my self actualization goals. While yes, I did receive compensation, it wasn't a motivating factor of why I chose to be a surrogate. Which is good because I ended up being bed-ridden and couldn't return to work until post partum. The compensation was the same amount I made yearly so financially it averaged out and gave me the ability to focus that year on the pregnancy and fulfilling my dream of giving someone such an incredible gift. \n\nSure, there is controversy around surrogacy and not every surrogacy story ends up being like yours or mine. However, I do think SIL is operating on an extreme biased opinion. Just because she doesn't value surrogacy as an option for becoming a parent, doesn't give her the right to alienate your child or try to control what he knows and believes about his existence. Her attitude and opinion could honestly hurt your son's feelings or self esteem. As a mother, I don't see that as being an adequate tradeoff merely for family harmony. Your family (you, wife, child) come first. Fuck SIL and her black and white thinking. Also fuck her for judging how you became parents instead of seeing the positive of your surrogacy journey. She can't just assume EVERY surrogacy situation is the same. NTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

So I\u2019d be less concerned about the coercive aspect of the surrogacy industry. \n\nSecond is that pretending you gave birth to your child or hiding their origin *is not in the best interest of the child*. I don\u2019t know what the genetic situation here is and if donor eggs or sperm was used - but every child has a right to know their origin.\n\nYour SIL wanting to pretend that the surrogacy never happened is her putting her feelings over the health and safety of a child.

The reality is infants don\u2019t percieve themselves as seperate from their mothers until around 6-7 months of age; so seperating them as newborns will always be traumatic, even if they don\u2019t remember it. (Since your surrogate is also a friend of yours, if she has a continued relationship with you and your baby, I\u2019m not sure if that would eliminate any potential trauma?) anyway, I\u2019m not saying this to guilt you - I just think you should be aware. Trauma, even trauma children don\u2019t remember, can impact their behavior and development. So if they start acting out it\u2019s not that they are a bad kid - it might just be from trauma.

Even feeling strongly about surrogacy, when a family member has already had the child through this method, the right thing to do is to embrace them and accept the situation for what it is. I've had mixed feelings about how some family members have chosen around reproduction. I think it is very sad when a child will never know their other biological parent by choice of their parents. I think people seriously underestimate how much that can affect the child. However, it's not loving to act as the sister-in-law is, and it doesn't help. It would be a good thing if this sister-in-law could be willing to accept the situation as it is and let the cousins have a relationship.
