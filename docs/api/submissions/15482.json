And in the present economy people are struggling enough without children so props to you for doing well. And I agree why disturb the balance unnecessary.\n\nIn this case your wife is TA.", "With important decisions such as having children, and how many, the rule should  be: it takes both to say yes and one to say no. You already have 4 children, and even if you can afford to support them now, you never know what the future will bring. Relying on a single income, even if it's a high one, is very risky. How is your wife managing as a SAHM? Is she single-handedly raising all of them, or is she parentifying the older ones?\n\nThreatening divorce to coherce a spouse into giving up their bodily autonomy is wrong on so many levels. I wonder if she realizes how difficult things would be for her if she went through with it. You'd be paying child support but it wouldn't be the same amount that you're bringing to the family now. You could even sue for full custody if she can't support the children. She's acting like a toddler who wants another toy and is throwing a tantrum to get it.\n\nNTA.", "NTA. Your body your choice. Even if you discussed it before you got married and you both thought you\u2019d have 10 kids, things change, situations change, feelings change. You aren\u2019t contractually bound to give her a football team if you don\u2019t want one or can\u2019t support one. \n\nHer choices are to accept your decision or divorce you and find someone else to keep impregnating her. I don\u2019t know the details of your situation or hers, but it sounds like she\u2019d be cutting off her nose to spite her face. \n\nBy divorcing you over this, she\u2019ll get to spend money on a divorce, then figure out how to afford her new life as a single mom and help financially support the kids she already has. Unless she\u2019s a trust fund baby, even if she gets half your pay in child support, her SAHM days are over. And that won\u2019t leave her a whole lot of time to find another man willing to become a step dad 4 times over just so she can have more kids. \n\nIt\u2019s understandable she\u2019d be disappointed if she expected a large family, but no rational person would go nuclear over this.", "NTA, your body, your choice. If you want a vasectomy, get one. Also a massive red flag, please take a step back and look at other instances of your wife being controlling and manipulative. Maybe divorce papers aren\u2019t a bad choice anyway.", "NTA, remind her that it is your body, your choice. You could also tell her that if she wants another kid then she can go get a job to help support you and the kids.", "NTA Your body your choice.\n\nHaving 4 kids also already sounds like hell on earth.", "Edit as you did have a discussion...\n\nNTA\n\nFair enough if you want to have the snip, four kids on one income must be tough as it is.", "NTA, it's your body. And in terms of kids, the partner who says enough is the one who should be listened to. Because it is easier to overcome that you want another kid (I'm not saying when it is childless couple and one want kid and another don't, only solution there is breakup) and don't have it, than start to resent the last kid and the partner. I'd suggest couple therapy and you can get your sperm frozen in case you change your mind. At least they offered this possibility to my husband when he had his vasectomy.", "You have 4 kids. You don't want anymore kids. You're NTA. But your wife is for her nonsense.", "NTA. But I think the disagreement about your vasectomy is not the real conflict. The real conflict is whether to have a fifth kid or not - and on this matter I'm going to side with you: having a(nother) kid shouldn't be something you're being bullied into agreeing to.\\\nIn your situation the vasectomy wouldn't change anything, except depriving her of the hope that she might somehow still convince you or trick you into having another kid sometime in the future. If you rule out a change of mind, the vasectomy by itself changes nothing.\n\nIMO your wife is the AH for threatening divorce. It implies that her having that fifth kid is more important than you and your existing four kids having an intact family. That is incredibly selfish.", "INFO: did either of you have a discussion about how many kids you wanted before either of these outcomes were reached? But also.

I know on my income I can support the 4 kids and her ( stay at home mom).\n\nI always believe 'Quality over Quantity'. What's the point of having more kids if you can't give them the best treatment they deserve. Unless your wife plans to work and contribute to family income then it's better to stop having kids (bc you said you can only support 4 kids n 2 adults w your income). What if having more kids means you need to cut off something from other kids (eg: hobbies, field/family trip, etc)?", "This might be a deal breaker for you both. \n\nI don't think you're an AH for wanting to get a vasectomy. It's your body your choice. You said you discussed it with her. It's still your choice. You are entitled to that control over your reproduction. \n\nNOBODY should be coerced into reproduction at any point in time. That should *always* be a free choice. \n\nThat is exactly what she is trying to do. Coerce you into having more children by holding your marriage over your head. \n\nOf course she is free to choose that option if she truly feels that strongly about having more kids, but that is a really hard line for her to draw. I'm wondering if there are other issues in your marriage. \n\nCounseling would be a great idea. Not to change your mind, but to help you guys get on the same page. You have valid reasons not to have more kids, and you have the right to control your reproductive ability. \n\nYou should probably take her at her word and talk to a lawyer. You will then know exactly where you stand. Your marriage doesn't seem solid if you guys never discussed how big of a family you wanted before starting that family. Or before getting married. How did you guys never talk about how many kids you wanted before you got married?", "NTA\n\nBut I think there are bigger problems in your relationship, that she's so quick to bring out the divorce threat over not getting her own way. \n\nDo you know why she's so hell-bent on popping out child after child after child? What happens if you give in.... when is she going to stop? 5 kids... 6 kids... 10 kids?", "4 is more than enough - NTA but you need to work with your wife on this", "NTA.\n\nFor the same reasons everyone else has already said.\n\nBut I'll also throw in that your wifes reactions seem unhealthy. Going straight to divorce because you don't want a *fifth* child??\n\nI think she needs to speak to a professional therapist. Perhaps she only sees her value as being a mother.\n\nI can't wrap my head around people who want big families. A fifth child, in 2023, when you can't afford it and your partner isn't in agreement about it?", "NTA", "NTA. Tell her to get a job then. Kiddos can go to daycare.", "NTA one bit", "NTA. It's your body, your choice, you have 4 children and don't want any more.  Your wife is however is the AH because of how she is trying to manipulate you by threatening divorce.", "NTA but your wife sure is. Threatening divorce because you don't want five kids when you already have four? What a cool way to break up a home.", "NTA.\n\nI will go the other way than most other commenters.\n\nHave the vasectomy. Don't tell her. Have all the sex she wants to.\n\nAnd if a kid doesn't come along after that, oh well \"It was God's will.\"\n\nThis is one of those 1 in a million situations where I lie would prevent a lot of problems.", "Tough one. It is definitely a two yes/ one no situation on having more kids - you can't split the difference and she can't force you to try for another child you don't want - and you seem to feel that way for very valid and responsible reasons btw. But her threatening to divorce you is quite a big deal. \n\nI'm going to go with NTA because it is your body and your choice - just as she should never be forced to carry a child she doesn't want, you shouldn't be forced to remain fertile when you don't want. But you need to have a proper conversation with her - quite possibly with a therapist present - being very, very clear that you are done having kids.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

We are talking about being able to buy them everything with no financial burden and also have enough to set up college fund. If she dont want to do that. No more babies so either she sucks it up and deals with it or she can leave and find another Partner who will give her more kids.

I told her I was fine when we only had the one and never brought it up until we just had our 4th and I know times are tuff and I'm the sole provider for my family.", "If you threaten to divorce someone if they don't impregnate you then you're an asshole and the marriage is doomed anyways", "You know actually I am the 4th child(surprise) with my siblings being 9,13and 15 years older. And I have seen them majorly looking out for me and helping in raising me. They sort of were my parent and had a major influence. I honestly do not agree with major responsibilities been passes on to siblings but help doesn't hurt. And that is what family is for. Right now I step up as a parent for my nieces and nephew(we all live near) but again this works for us and maybe won't work for other people.", "That sounds like a lot. I don't see the point in having more, it will just take a toll on all of you.", "I\u2019ve been there working 12 hour shifts and that is not fun but the difference is I didn\u2019t have anyone I needed to support. You have my respect for being able to do that and find the time to be with your kids", "Okay, then I guess NTA but it does sound like a deal breaker for your wife.", "But before this you guys never established how big you wanted your family to be? When was the last time you had a realistic conversation about the future? Like where do you see our lives in the next five years, the next ten type deal. Because it seems like the fifth/no fifth kid should have come up.", "Ok so you did discuss family size ahead of time. And you have compromised already. Definitely NTA\n\nI hate to be paranoid but you might want to be very cautious about having sex until you are sure an accident can't happen. \n\nHopefully she has been evaluated for PPD, symptoms can vary wildly. It's can manifest in drastic changes in behavior. Only you know if this is out of character for her when she does not get her wish.", "If you are still having sex with her then I suggest you use condoms. She will try and have another baby.", "did you try marriage counselling? (Also NTA, your body your choice. Also don't bring kids into this world you don't want)", "In that case, NTA in this situation", "That is to long ago. Maybe she would have reacted better if you talked about it yesterday before making an appointment. Would it be helpfull if she went with you to the appointment?", "NAH. I have 3 under 4 so i just want to say i feel your struggle with keeping up with so many kids. I also want more kids eventually so i understand how your wife feels. Its just one of those issues that you really cant compromise on.", "How attractive/old is she that she thinks she can go to the dating market as a SAHM with 4 kids (either in her custody or yours) and find a guy willing to give her another one? It sounds ludicrous", "I would fight for your marriage much more, however I strongly think she's bluffing you. The fact that she wants another child means that she is very family oriented and to break apart an otherwise good family to add a fifth child.", "This is true. But the logic of saying his body his choice is poor given there are consequences in the relationship", "Don\u2019t get me wrong I understand the family dynamic and I\u2019m happy to hear that y\u2019all have such a great bond but not everyone is gonna deal with that with such grace", "I edited it saying we're we did talk about it before btw.", "We talked about it after our 4th was born and that we had a great family and she said well I may want another and I said then that I didn't and our finances couldn't handle it. Then 2 months ago I mentioned the vesectomy to begin with and thats when the 5th became a solid want for her.", "So the divorce hasn't really been brought up before but there's definitely things that she does if she doesn't get her way.", "I honestly don't see a time I could go to counseling honestly with the 4 kiddos and my work schedule if I'm not working I spend the time I can with my family but when I work I'm gone 15 hours a day.", "Honestly I don't think it would be helpful as she has tried to get me to call and cancel everyday for the last 3 days now.", "I mean I think she is sexy as hell and we are in our early 30s but at the same time I know there has been quite a few people constantly hit on her. Which I pay no attention to as imo I feel like it's a compliment and she did say she was married and not interested but idk if that will change now or not if you know what I mean.", "I have been doing my best to work with her on things we have been married over 10 years now and I have done everything on a sole income the entire time we have been together.", "I agree. This is just the way I was raised. You know my parents lived with my bua( father's sister) and her husband for 25 years before moving to our current home which happens to be a 5 minute walking distance. People are amazed because it get pretty toxic but they made it work. And we are still very close to each other. I can't tell how difficult it is to explain my family dynamic to others. But it is just us. And I have seen the things you are talking about. That is why I said it works for us but may not for anyone else.", "She is delusional and probably has mental stuff she's projecting on the kids. Having 5 kids in 2023 is madness if you're not wealthy.\n\nCall her bluff. She if she'll leave you and will want to separate father and children plus live on crumbs you send her.\n\nWe're 8bi people already, we don't need any more of your guys\" DNA, no offense intended. \n\nIf you have a 5th kid you'd have to PAY for its upbringing, and since you're the breadwinner, that's your sole decision.", "I mean, it doesn't really help you now, but for anyone else this is the kind of thing you need to establish before you actually get married. My wife and I knew two was our limit and I got snipped within a few months of our second's birth.", "But you never discussed it before having kids? NTA but I feel for the wife because it\u2019s not like the want to have a kid just goes away because your spouse doesn\u2019t.  But this should have been something she talked to you about since it was something she may or may not want and you said you didn\u2019t.", "But this isn\u2019t a discussion. This is her saying what she wants, you saying what you want, and then you stopped talking before you reached a mutual decision. You can\u2019t just make that decision and expect her to go along with it without a full discussion, but she\u2019s also an AH for threatening divorce like that. ESH", "I think some of it might be to do with the fact that she didn\u2019t know it would be her last baby (your fourth)? My husband would have liked three, but I\u2019ve made it very clear that I intend for our next (second) to be our last. He\u2019s able to make peace with it, and treats the experiences like they will be the last ones. I think it\u2019s different if you don\u2019t know, or didn\u2019t have a plan from the get go - she\u2019s probably sad about not being able to experience those things again.\nManipulating you with divorce is undoubtedly wrong, but I think it\u2019s worth having a discussion about why she really feels like she needs to have a fifth baby. Maybe you can compromise (she can work part time or something?)", "Like I said\n\nBe very careful with sex until you are sure you can't get her pregnant. \n\nSee a lawyer\n\nMarriage counseling", "If you get divorced you would have to rearrange your life anyway. Rearranging  your life to find time for counselling can end up being way easier in the long run.", "Did you talk to her about the implications of a fifth child? Did you have a respectfull elaborate talk about it? I totaly get not wanting a fifth child. I have two and we are done haha. But i am curious for her reasonings for wanting another child. If she is bored, maybe it is time for her to get a part time job or something?", "Does it matter if it changes? You are both willing to draw up the divorce papers over this. So eventually you\u2019ll both be single getting hit on. I agree your body your choice, but she\u2019s also made it clear she wants more kids which is also her right. ESH for not having this conversation earlier", "I get this. My bua dropped everything (husband + 2 elders + 3 kids) to take care of me and my brother (in another city) when my dad had heart surgery, allowing my mom to focus on him instead of worrying about us kids too. It was my uncle's idea. My mom stayed with her brother (whose wife hates her) for almost two months so she could be with her mother in her last days. \n\nAt the same time, I know families so toxic that even an attempt to support one another like this would be impossible.", "I was thinking the same thing. Like realistically what does the wife get by throwing divorce out there like that? There\u2019s only 2 outcomes the way I see it\n\n1. He caves in they have another child. He becomes extremely unhappy and they end up divorced anyways \n\n2. He says yeah let\u2019s get divorced. Child support only covers groceries, expenses for the kids, maybe some utility bills but she ends up having to get a job because she can\u2019t afford rent \n\nLose lose for the wife", "Do NOT so this as a bluff. \n\nGet your own divorce papers ready, 1st. Because she sounds serious enough to split up a 4 child family because you won't give her a 5th.", "Agreed but the discussion needs to happen all over again after each kid. Each kid changes the household dynamic so much that I really think it starts the conversation over. We have 3 but we went from wanting numerous to just 2 after the first to 5 after the second to 3 after the third. She wasn't a turd that ruined us, it just took longer to get pregnant with her and we didn't want to continue our plan of numerous if we were going to be dealing with long gaps between pregnancies.", "Even if they had talked about, a TON can change between no kids and *four* kids.", "Originally when we got together she told me she could not have kids. But we kept trying and it happened.", "We have talked about all the responsibilities of having more children and it just seems to go out the window when it comes to this and her wanting another one. And as far as a job she will not get one.", "I don\u2019t disagree. But her mind could also not change. Which is why if she felt like she still wanted more she should have brought it up. Don\u2019t know what you are trying to argue here\u2026", "yeah, that's cute... so you explained your financial situation to her as a sole financial contributor - and she still wants another child and refuses to get a job? \n\nalso, if you do not want another child - that is it. noone can or should be able to force someone to become a parent.\n\nNTA", "And his could", "But he was on the no side of the fence and didn\u2019t change his mind. Therefore the burden was on her since she was straddling the fence"]}
