And in the present economy people are struggling enough without children so props to you for doing well. And I agree why disturb the balance unnecessary.\n\nIn this case your wife is TA.", "With important decisions such as having children, and how many, the rule should  be: it takes both to say yes and one to say no. You already have 4 children, and even if you can afford to support them now, you never know what the future will bring. Relying on a single income, even if it's a high one, is very risky. How is your wife managing as a SAHM? Is she single-handedly raising all of them, or is she parentifying the older ones?\n\nThreatening divorce to coherce a spouse into giving up their bodily autonomy is wrong on so many levels. I wonder if she realizes how difficult things would be for her if she went through with it. You'd be paying child support but it wouldn't be the same amount that you're bringing to the family now. You could even sue for full custody if she can't support the children. She's acting like a toddler who wants another toy and is throwing a tantrum to get it.\n\nNTA.", "NTA. Your body your choice. Even if you discussed it before you got married and you both thought you\u2019d have 10 kids, things change, situations change, feelings change. You aren\u2019t contractually bound to give her a football team if you don\u2019t want one or can\u2019t support one. \n\nHer choices are to accept your decision or divorce you and find someone else to keep impregnating her. I don\u2019t know the details of your situation or hers, but it sounds like she\u2019d be cutting off her nose to spite her face. \n\nBy divorcing you over this, she\u2019ll get to spend money on a divorce, then figure out how to afford her new life as a single mom and help financially support the kids she already has. Unless she\u2019s a trust fund baby, even if she gets half your pay in child support, her SAHM days are over. And that won\u2019t leave her a whole lot of time to find another man willing to become a step dad 4 times over just so she can have more kids. \n\nIt\u2019s understandable she\u2019d be disappointed if she expected a large family, but no rational person would go nuclear over this.", "NTA, your body, your choice. If you want a vasectomy, get one. Also a massive red flag, please take a step back and look at other instances of your wife being controlling and manipulative. Maybe divorce papers aren\u2019t a bad choice anyway.", "NTA, remind her that it is your body, your choice. You could also tell her that if she wants another kid then she can go get a job to help support you and the kids.", "NTA Your body your choice.\n\nHaving 4 kids also already sounds like hell on earth.", "Edit as you did have a discussion...\n\nNTA\n\nFair enough if you want to have the snip, four kids on one income must be tough as it is.", "NTA, it's your body. And in terms of kids, the partner who says enough is the one who should be listened to. Because it is easier to overcome that you want another kid (I'm not saying when it is childless couple and one want kid and another don't, only solution there is breakup) and don't have it, than start to resent the last kid and the partner. I'd suggest couple therapy and you can get your sperm frozen in case you change your mind. At least they offered this possibility to my husband when he had his vasectomy.", "You have 4 kids. You don't want anymore kids. You're NTA. But your wife is for her nonsense.", "NTA. But I think the disagreement about your vasectomy is not the real conflict. The real conflict is whether to have a fifth kid or not - and on this matter I'm going to side with you: having a(nother) kid shouldn't be something you're being bullied into agreeing to.\\\nIn your situation the vasectomy wouldn't change anything, except depriving her of the hope that she might somehow still convince you or trick you into having another kid sometime in the future. If you rule out a change of mind, the vasectomy by itself changes nothing.\n\nIMO your wife is the AH for threatening divorce. It implies that her having that fifth kid is more important than you and your existing four kids having an intact family. That is incredibly selfish.", "INFO: did either of you have a discussion about how many kids you wanted before either of these outcomes were reached? But also.

I know on my income I can support the 4 kids and her ( stay at home mom).\n\nI always believe 'Quality over Quantity'. What's the point of having more kids if you can't give them the best treatment they deserve. Unless your wife plans to work and contribute to family income then it's better to stop having kids (bc you said you can only support 4 kids n 2 adults w your income). What if having more kids means you need to cut off something from other kids (eg: hobbies, field/family trip, etc)?", "This might be a deal breaker for you both. \n\nI don't think you're an AH for wanting to get a vasectomy. It's your body your choice. You said you discussed it with her. It's still your choice. You are entitled to that control over your reproduction. \n\nNOBODY should be coerced into reproduction at any point in time. That should *always* be a free choice. \n\nThat is exactly what she is trying to do. Coerce you into having more children by holding your marriage over your head. \n\nOf course she is free to choose that option if she truly feels that strongly about having more kids, but that is a really hard line for her to draw. I'm wondering if there are other issues in your marriage. \n\nCounseling would be a great idea. Not to change your mind, but to help you guys get on the same page. You have valid reasons not to have more kids, and you have the right to control your reproductive ability. \n\nYou should probably take her at her word and talk to a lawyer. You will then know exactly where you stand. Your marriage doesn't seem solid if you guys never discussed how big of a family you wanted before starting that family. Or before getting married. How did you guys never talk about how many kids you wanted before you got married?", "NTA\n\nBut I think there are bigger problems in your relationship, that she's so quick to bring out the divorce threat over not getting her own way. \n\nDo you know why she's so hell-bent on popping out child after child after child? What happens if you give in.... when is she going to stop? 5 kids... 6 kids... 10 kids?", "4 is more than enough - NTA but you need to work with your wife on this", "NTA.\n\nFor the same reasons everyone else has already said.\n\nBut I'll also throw in that your wifes reactions seem unhealthy. Going straight to divorce because you don't want a *fifth* child??\n\nI think she needs to speak to a professional therapist. Perhaps she only sees her value as being a mother.\n\nI can't wrap my head around people who want big families. A fifth child, in 2023, when you can't afford it and your partner isn't in agreement about it?", "NTA", "NTA. Tell her to get a job then. Kiddos can go to daycare.", "NTA one bit", "NTA. It's your body, your choice, you have 4 children and don't want any more.  Your wife is however is the AH because of how she is trying to manipulate you by threatening divorce.", "NTA but your wife sure is. Threatening divorce because you don't want five kids when you already have four? What a cool way to break up a home.", "NTA.\n\nI will go the other way than most other commenters.\n\nHave the vasectomy. Don't tell her. Have all the sex she wants to.\n\nAnd if a kid doesn't come along after that, oh well \"It was God's will.\"\n\nThis is one of those 1 in a million situations where I lie would prevent a lot of problems.", "Tough one. It is definitely a two yes/ one no situation on having more kids - you can't split the difference and she can't force you to try for another child you don't want - and you seem to feel that way for very valid and responsible reasons btw. But her threatening to divorce you is quite a big deal. \n\nI'm going to go with NTA because it is your body and your choice - just as she should never be forced to carry a child she doesn't want, you shouldn't be forced to remain fertile when you don't want. But you need to have a proper conversation with her - quite possibly with a therapist present - being very, very clear that you are done having kids.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

We are talking about being able to buy them everything with no financial burden and also have enough to set up college fund. If she dont want to do that. No more babies so either she sucks it up and deals with it or she can leave and find another Partner who will give her more kids.

One of the things you need to help your wife see is the financial burden that each additional child puts on the family. Having four children is a pretty good size family already. Sit down with a printed spreadsheet of how much you make a month and all of the expenses that are required. Try to see if you can get bank statement from the previous month or two to see what the averages are of each of the expenses (make sure to include any health insurance your employer pays for even if they only pay for a portion as it is part of your employment benefits). Put them all in a list. Make sure you add in any discretionary spending like entertainment or eating out and put it in a category by itself. If you put money away each month, then add a category for that as well. After you have everything compiled, then sit down with her in a quiet place and go over everything. Let her know that you work hard to take care of the family. Show her how much more every child would cost the family.  \n\n\nI also think it is good for the both of you to go over what changes if you have a vasectomy. It won't cause any changes in your sex life. If she is worried, the procedure is an out-patient surgery that takes about 40-45 minutes in the doctors office and then requires care for about a week. I can tell you this because I had one 25 years ago (a follow-up lab is done to make sure that the procedure was successful). \n\nGood luck! -D", "Your body, your choice. NTA.

If you both were not sure, but you were leaning towards no, you could always freeze some sperm in case you change your mind. Anyway, as one of 5 children, I can say that if something happens to you, the more children that you have, the worse off everyone will be. My parents struggled so much, after a car wreck injured my father. Later, he suffered more medical issues when the younger children were still at home-- it was horrible for them and for us older ones who had to sacrifice in order to help out. Same if something happens to your wife. I had one, but have to watch my sibling (and help A LOT) suffer, because they had so many children and now cannot properly take care of them due to medical issues. \n\nAnyway, you feel 4 is enough.
