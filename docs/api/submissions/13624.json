{"id": 13624, "submission_id": "127jqaj", "title": "AITA for not telling my wife to tone down her dancing at our wedding?", "selftext": "Throwaway because my wife has Reddit.\n\nMy wife (29F) and I (29M) got married last weekend. We\u2019ve been together since first year of uni and got married on the 10 year anniversary of the day I asked her to be my girlfriend. We\u2019ve grown up together, got through thick and thin and I know there is no one else I want to spend my life with.\n\nFor context, my wife is half Spanish and we incorporated a lot of Spanish traditions into our wedding. It also meant that, with all her family there, the reception turned into quite the party.\n\nI was pretty tired after dancing for a while so I went to sit and talk with my family whilst my wife kept dancing with her cousins and friends. After a bit of chatting, my mum and aunt essentially told me that they weren\u2019t too pleased with my wife\u2019s dancing to songs like \u201cLow\u201d and \u201cSexyBack,\u201d saying that her slut drops and \u201cwiggling her bottom like that\u201d weren\u2019t appropriate on her wedding day and were disrespectful to me. To be honest, I didn\u2019t see anything wrong with the way she was dancing - it was nothing more than I think any person would dance to songs like that in the club when they were having fun and had a couple drinks - and I told them as such. They said I should tell her to tone it down, but she was having fun with her friends and I didn\u2019t see anything gratuitous about it, nor was she super drunk, so I told her it wasn't my place. We ended up wrapping up the party soon afterwards anyway.\n\nThe morning after, we had breakfast with my family and my aunt mentioned to my wife that she was pleased that I eventually got her to \u201ctone down the fiesta.\u201d My wife asked what she meant by that and my mum told her about the conversation from last night (my wife has told me about this, I was talking to my dad and uncle at the time and didn\u2019t hear). My wife apologised but was then very quiet for the rest of the day, and when we left the hotel she was very upset with me, saying I should have told her that she had offended my family and that she was humiliated that I hadn\u2019t told her anything about it on the night, like my aunt had assumed. I was sorry that she was humiliated but I was not sorry that I hadn\u2019t told her to tone it down, because in my opinion she didn\u2019t do anything wrong. She still thinks I should have just told her because now she won't have a good relationship with her in-laws (she doesn\u2019t have a good one with her parents). I\u2019m mad at my mum and aunt and want them to apologise to us, but she refuses to bring it up with them and wants to apologise again to them when they come over this weekend. I want to stand up for her because I think they're being incredibly rude, but she doesn't want that, she just wants to mend bridges. She's still upset with me because I don't see it her way and because I'm not sorry that I didn't tell her.

Your wife is an adult and it was her wedding. If they were offended, they could leave. I know it's not likely to happen, but they owe your wife a huge apology for being such huge AHs and tarnishing your wedding.", "You are not TA but, let her apologise.. she will regret this later but it is the best way she will learn to not \"bend over\" someone else's opinions later.", "NTA. I am proud of how you handled the situation but mostly for not ruining the fun your wife was having. Your wife tho needs to unlearn to accept that kind of sexism just because she wants to have a good relationship with her in-laws or anyone for that matter. The fact your mom and aunt sexualized her dancing at her own freaking wedding is disgusting and sounds like a THEM problem.", "Nta\n\nGod help them if they ever came to a wedding in my family. I personally did the alligator to taking care of business in my wedding dress. Granted over 30 years ago and my knees still hate me but damn it was fun.", "You and your wife are NTA\n\nYour family is so controlling and rude that when going to you didn't work, __they told her to her face that she danced provocatively__ and pretended you did what they told you.\n\nThis needs to stop immediately. You need to stand up for her and give them serious consequences. Otherwise,  they will continue this throughout your relationship.", "NTA but your Mum and Aunt are horrible racists with the \"fiesta\" remark. Your wife clearly wants a good relationship with your family but she's not gonna want to do anything with them if they don't fix their behaviour and attitude. \n\nTell them they are looking at low contact on both sides and no contact with future spawn (if you're planning any). I'd hate to think what they'd say about mixed race children.", "NTA. Good on you for not stopping your wife from having fun on YOUR wedding day.  Don\u2019t let your wife apologize to them for anything because she didn\u2019t do anything wrong.  You should, however, confront them about their lies and prudish behavior in front of your wife.", "NTA\n\nThere\u2019s a beautiful rendition of [Get Low](https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZTRcdNpED/) on TT, plus I\u2019m sure you could find many fun remixes to dance to with your wife and her friends \ud83e\udd70", "NTA to you and your wife.\n\nNTA to you because you stood up for your wife, which is so rare to see in AITA posts... but also NTA to your wife because it's understandable to be upset after being embarrassed by those comments from your aunt, and maybe she just wanted to avoid the situation. Neither of you are wrong, especially you. \n\nYour mom and aunt were the AHs but I'm sure in this situation you already knew that. \n\nCongratulations on the wedding! Hopefully this will be a small hiccup you can laugh at later:)", "NTA. your mom and aunt are pretty gross, and probably a bit racist. \n\nMy cousin married an Indian guy, and we're all pretty WASPy and our dance moves are basically what happens if you make a Halloween skeleton slightly animated.\n\nThe groom and his family got a bit liquored up and danced the *pants* off of us, and it was excellent, and every single person had a fantastic time. We did have to convince my aunt that her new hip would *not* allow her to learn this style.", "NTA, but you will have to regularly remind your wife that you love her for who she is and that's why you married her, and your aunt is being kinda classist/elitist and a little racist (e.g. \"tone down the fiesta\"). Not gonna lie, that line had my blood boiling for a hot second.", "Your wife is trying to fit in and didn't want there to be trouble.  However, the comment by your aunt about the \"fiesta\" is a clear indicator that your wife's race played a part in their judgement.  Honestly, I think YTA for not saying something about that.  Your wife has nothing to be ashamed about.  You, however, should be a better husband when it comes to the judgement of potentially racist relatives.  She shouldn't have to endure that to be married to you and it would eventually kill that union.", "Ugh.. your mom and aunts rude ass comments about your wife remind me of all the repressed prudes commenting on the JLo and Shakira half time performance. That shit stems from jealousy. NTA  \n\nI also think your wife might be overly nice to your female fam members because of the lack of relationship with her own mom. Please tell her not to make herself a doormat to these women. They'll \"tone\" her down too much!", "NTA.\n\nYour parents are the AHs.

I understand your wife\u2019s concern, but there\u2019s no way you could have known how\u2019d she feel about the situation. You can\u2019t read minds.
