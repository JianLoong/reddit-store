We\u2019ve been together since first year of uni and got married on the 10 year anniversary of the day I asked her to be my girlfriend. We\u2019ve grown up together, got through thick and thin and I know there is no one else I want to spend my life with.\n\nFor context, my wife is half Spanish and we incorporated a lot of Spanish traditions into our wedding. It also meant that, with all her family there, the reception turned into quite the party.\n\nI was pretty tired after dancing for a while so I went to sit and talk with my family whilst my wife kept dancing with her cousins and friends. After a bit of chatting, my mum and aunt essentially told me that they weren\u2019t too pleased with my wife\u2019s dancing to songs like \u201cLow\u201d and \u201cSexyBack,\u201d saying that her slut drops and \u201cwiggling her bottom like that\u201d weren\u2019t appropriate on her wedding day and were disrespectful to me. To be honest, I didn\u2019t see anything wrong with the way she was dancing - it was nothing more than I think any person would dance to songs like that in the club when they were having fun and had a couple drinks - and I told them as such. They said I should tell her to tone it down, but she was having fun with her friends and I didn\u2019t see anything gratuitous about it, nor was she super drunk, so I told her it wasn't my place. We ended up wrapping up the party soon afterwards anyway.\n\nThe morning after, we had breakfast with my family and my aunt mentioned to my wife that she was pleased that I eventually got her to \u201ctone down the fiesta.\u201d My wife asked what she meant by that and my mum told her about the conversation from last night (my wife has told me about this, I was talking to my dad and uncle at the time and didn\u2019t hear). My wife apologised but was then very quiet for the rest of the day, and when we left the hotel she was very upset with me, saying I should have told her that she had offended my family and that she was humiliated that I hadn\u2019t told her anything about it on the night, like my aunt had assumed. I was sorry that she was humiliated but I was not sorry that I hadn\u2019t told her to tone it down, because in my opinion she didn\u2019t do anything wrong. She still thinks I should have just told her because now she won't have a good relationship with her in-laws (she doesn\u2019t have a good one with her parents). I\u2019m mad at my mum and aunt and want them to apologise to us, but she refuses to bring it up with them and wants to apologise again to them when they come over this weekend. I want to stand up for her because I think they're being incredibly rude, but she doesn't want that, she just wants to mend bridges. She's still upset with me because I don't see it her way and because I'm not sorry that I didn't tell her.

Let them know that you\u2019re not an extension of them and their thoughts, but your own person with your own cultural identity, and they don\u2019t have to agree with it, but their opinion was neither warranted nor appropriate in that circumstance. They don\u2019t police your wife\u2019s behaviour. You don\u2019t police your wife\u2019s behaviour either, and their suggestion that you do so to make them more comfortable was inappropriate.
