As long as she respects your stepbrother\u2019s answer, nothing wrong. You rightfully called it their wedding, so don\u2019t interfere with the guest list. Your stepbrother is perfectly capable of handling that himself. And", "NAH. It\u2019s not  your wedding so you should probably stay out of it. Your mom just wants to make a request. As long as she respects your step brother\u2019s answer, I don\u2019t see the problem. It\u2019s not unusual for the happy couple to allow their parents or step parents to invite one or two of their friends. Some couples would agree to this and some wouldn\u2019t. It depends on the couple\u2019s preferences for their big day.", "Probably most will disagree with me, but I say - YTA.\n\nAs you say in your post - it is your stepbrother and fiance's day.  \n\nWhy do you get to say who should be invited anymore than your mom does?   \n\nDon't insert yourself in arguments that have nothing to do with you.   \n\nLet your mom ask and step brother can decide how to answer.", "It's not up to you who should or shouldn't come to the wedding. That should be up to your step brother.", "YTA You are right it is about them not you, so it is up to them not you.", "NTA - my MIL brought a plus THREE to my daughter\u2019s wedding without asking and then wanted to know where the wine was.  (We didn\u2019t have any). Neither of them even brought a gift.  Her excuse was because she wanted some friends there. I\u2019ll never understand the thought process of inviting someone else to another person\u2019s party let alone private emotional event.", "Have you ever attended a wedding where you either don\u2019t know or barely know any of the guests? It sucks. Weddings are more enjoyable when you have one or more people to hang out with during the event."]}
