He was spending money to make sure your needs were taken care of. I think your mom is wrong for being upset about this. You're stuck in a rough situation and trying to do the best you can. It sounds like you're supposed to meet in a neutral place for \"hand-off\" so your mom also doesn't need to know where your dad lives.

I was raised by someone who, as soon as I became a teen, expected me to mediate their issues and fights with their spouse (mostly amounting to taking their side). It made me think I needed to have an opinion or be a \u201cgrown up\u201d. That shit sucks. Your mom is the AH for asking you to do the dirty work for her messed up plans. Let her do the legwork if she wants to sue. This should absolutely not be any of your concern!", "NTA - Whatever beef your parents have with each other, that's theirs. Don't lie for them, don't keep secrets from them, let them work their stuff out.", "You ate not the asshole because you are a child.\n\nBoth your parents are assholes because they both tried to use you to hurt the other", "NTA. They need to look at that cost for glasses. I paid less than $100 out of pocket for an exam. Then ordered 2 sets of glasses off of Zenni.com for less than $150... no insurance involved.", "NTA. Sorry that your parents have you in the middle of their mess.", "NTA\n\nBut your mom isn\u2019t necessarily wrong about your dad cutting support for the glasses.\n\nChild support isn\u2019t designed to cover all expenses of the child.  It\u2019s designed to ensure the child has reasonable living conditions in both residences.  Things like glasses could be required to be split depending on custody agreement.\n\nIf you mom said she would pay $300 for glasses then that is the budget unless someone else is willing to pay more.  Your father doesn\u2019t get to arbitrarily decide that your mom will pay $500 for glasses.\n\nAnd in general glasses can be purchased for $300 unless you are getting super specialized \n\nIt\u2019s really weird unless there are abuse issues that your dad doesn\u2019t want to let your mom know where he lives.\n\nEither way none of this is your concern and your parents both suck for putting you in the middle of this and asking you to lie on their behalf.", "You are a kid. NTA. You should not even hear their discussion and mom should already know his address-  that\u2019s alway a stipulation in child court cases. Child support covers the glasses.  They split out of pocket from insurance.  Mom and dad need to go to court and get expenses written out clearly or get out divorce decree and go by what it says.  They are all very detailed and clear. Mom\u2019s husband needs to butt out- he doesn\u2019t have a say in this.  They also need to leave you out of this.", "NTA- your dad is in the right, Medical expenses are to be covered by the primary guardian and those expenses are reflected in the amount of child support he owes. Her threatening to sue for something she is obligated to pay for is a nasty mark on her character.", "NTA\n\nIt's understandable that you would feel conflicted in this situation. On the one hand, you didn't want your mom to sue your dad over the cost of your glasses, and you wanted to help your dad by telling him what your mom was planning. On the other hand, you didn't want to betray your mom's trust by sharing information that she had asked you to keep secret.\n\nIn this situation, it's not necessarily wrong for you to have told your dad what your mom was planning. You were trying to protect your dad and prevent your mom from taking legal action against him. However, it's important to remember that it's not your job to mediate conflicts between your parents. It's up to them to work out their differences and come to an agreement on how to handle the situation.\n\nAdditionally, it's important to remember that your mom is your parent and deserves your respect and loyalty. By sharing information that she asked you to keep secret, you may have betrayed her trust and hurt her feelings. It's important for you to apologize to your mom for doing this and to try to repair the damage to your relationship with her.\n\nIn conclusion, it's not necessarily wrong for you to have told your dad what your mom was planning, but it's important to remember that it's not your job to mediate conflicts between your parents. It's also important to apologize to your mom for betraying her trust and to try to repair your relationship with her.", "ESH, I know you're only 13, so I'm going to give you a little bit of slack. You should never have been involved in this in the first place. It's not your business who pays who how much child support, or who pays what for your medical needs. Your parents are assholes for even having you be involved at all. $500 for glasses really isn't that much money. That being said, I'm a mom, I'm a grandma. When medical expenses come up, they get paid for, because that's what happens when you decide to have kids. Your parents need to work out between them who was paying for what, and the court gets to decide who owes what for medical expenses, that's what all of that fun paperwork that happens when child support, parental obligations, and parenting time is decided. They should never have brought you into the conversation. That being said, you lied. It doesn't matter who you thought was right or wrong, there's no way that you can know the entire story of everything that's going on. I was a mom who only got child support in situations where somehow the government could get a hold of the dad's money and send it to me. In the future, don't get dragged into the conversation. Any of it. Most parental obligation paperwork requires that both parents are legally entitled to have the other parents address either way. If they try to bring you into another human just say, you need to talk to mom/dad about this, this isn't my business.", "ESH.\n\nYou for lying. Your mom has a right to know where her child is staying. What if there was an emergency and she needed to get you ASAP? What if something happened to your dad?\n\n\nYour dad seems shady. Why is he so against your mom knowing his address? It just seems crazy that your mother doesn't know where you are when you're with your father. \n\n\nAlso, does he have the receipt for how much the exam and glasses cost? If your mom set a budget of $300 he should be responsible for anything over that. Child support isn't meant to cover 100% of the child's expenses. In a lot of divorced families medical bills are covered 50/50.\n\n\nYour mom seems the least AH-ish in this situation. The only reason I am including her is she shouldn't have involved you. She should have gotten his address another way instead of asking you.", "YTA. You already know you should have minded your own business.  You are 13, but it's time for you to start realizing that there are some occasions that you should not be involved in.  It's very difficult for you being put into the position of choosing between dad & mom.   That's the red flag.  Just don't do what's being asked of you if it requires you to pick one over the other.  When questioned about why you didn't do it, the correct answer is \"Sorry, I forgot.\" If that doesn't satisfy then cry.   Being referee to parental combat is a crappy way to learn how to be an adult.   Just remember that none of this is your fault.   Parents did it to themselves.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

She should not be putting you in the middle of having to choose between parents and being sneaky and deceptive. Furthermore, if your parents have a legal court appointed child support agreement set, then your father should not have deviated from the child support payments. Even if he didn\u2019t, It was right of you to tell your father. It was wrong of him to ask you to lie.

Your parents should give you the food, shelter and medical care you need without making a fuss, much less drag you into their drama.", "NTA.  You are thirteen years old and your parents are both asking you to keep secrets and using you in their ongoing war.  This is truly awful, and I'm so sorry you're experiencing this.   \n You absolutely did not betray your mom by being open with your dad.  It's not fair to ask a child to keep secrets. Yet you were put in a position of being asked to keep secrets from  parents; this is wrong and you got to share the so-called secrets.  I think that your safest alternative might be to let both parents know that you're not comfortable keeping secrets (your mom's plans, you dad's address, anything whatsoever) from either of them, and you'd appreciate it if they didn't share any information they don't want you to share.  But I do have some concerns that if you do this, your mom might react with more anger.  The glasses are a problem, but the way you're being pulled into what's going on between your parents is a bigger problem.  Is there a neutral, trusted adult with whom you can discuss this?  Is there a school counselor, or a teacher, or a trusted religious leader who works with kids, or can you ask for a therapist?  This is really too much for you to have to handle on your own or with strangers on Reddit.  Remember:  You did nothing wrong.  You were put in an impossible position and you did your best.  You're a great kid, but the adults around you are behaving badly.", "NTA child support your dad pays is for you so the 200 comes out that for your glasses.\n\nI never understand how parents never understand child support is wow to support the child!! \n\nAnd besides your a child, your mom shouldnt involve you in this.", "I'm of the same mind, but with a different result. The OP should be a paragon of openness. Yes, tell mom dad's address. Yes, tell dad that mom is suing. Its a lot easier to be open to everyone than to try to remember what is a secret to be kept from whom.", "And I bet you have a simple script and no astigmatism.   I've had to use Zenni before, and even then my glasses with a cheap frame were much more than that 10 years ago.

I wish I wasn't involved but she's so mad at me \n\nHe cut 200 off the child support because he already gives her 200 extra, he figured if she got 1800 this month it wouldn't be such a big deal but im just trying to stay neutral...", "Agree on the glasses.  Classy father would have coughed up the extra since she said $300. Not classy to deduct it from child support.  The higher cost is likely frames. And the father doesn't give his address to mom? Just very strange.  Yeah, child shouldn't be in the middle.", "I know I shouldn't have been involved but I didn't really have a choice. I actually wanted to not answer her at all but my dad warned me and I guess included me. This always happens, I'm like their little thing they use to communicate.", "She doesn't know the address because he recently moved, she knows the city. If she asked any other time he would tell her 100%. Yes he does have a receipt", "I really did try to not get involved\nBut even if I were to not respond she'd still somehow involve me in the ride back home. But thanks anyways", "Also get a copy of the prescription so you can just order a spare set of glasses online. Have a backup just like important data.", "Zenni.com and eyebuydirect.com ship to everywhere so your parents are both overpaying for glasses AND putting you in the middle of their nonsense. Your mother not knowing your father's address is insanity. Every parent has a right to know where their child is spending time. \n\nYou go on those websites, pick out some glasses and solve this problem for your parents. You can get 2-5 different pair of glasses for $300. So instead of 1 pair of overpriced glasses you'll have several pairs of great glasses you can switch between.", "That\u2019s not his decision to make though.
