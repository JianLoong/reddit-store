No. You didn't say it to hurt her. You stated your truth and you don't need to apologize for it. NTA", "NTA. I\u2019m a much older sibling. My youngest brother probably DID feel like an only child! He was 11 when I left for college. For what it\u2019s worth, we are all in our thirties and forties now and the age difference doesn\u2019t matter one bit. But we had very different childhoods as a result of the age difference, and that\u2019s simply a fact. I don\u2019t think you were wrong to mention this in the context of spacing children\u2026or at all.", "NTA. What you said wasn\u2019t vindictive. You weren\u2019t blaming your siblings for not coming around, or your parents for making it happen. What you said wasn\u2019t even really negative. It was like a snapshot of what your childhood was. If feelings were hurt, it\u2019s because of feelings of guilt. Maybe they\u2019ll do better going forward, it\u2019s not too late for them to make you the favorite uncle. Excuse me if I\u2019m out of line, I know you\u2019re good, but I still feel bad for you.", "NTA I have 7 siblings and felt like an only child grow up because my dad had custody of me, my mom had custody of 2 of her other kids, and my dads 4 other kids were adults and in other states.\n\nYou expressed how you felt. Your mom is the a h for trying to make YOU feel even worse for it.", "NTA!  If it's any consolation, I was an \"oops\" baby, too!  My brother was 10, my sister was 8 and my closest sibling was 6 yrs to the day (I had the misfortune of having to share my birthday!) when I arrived!  They were hoping for a boy, just for fitting us all in to a small house, but I was never cooperative!  I was a girl!  My parents were celebrating dad's new promotion, got a little frisky during a dangerous time of the month, and here I am!  \n\nLike you, I grew up feeling like a single child.  But I loved it because I got way more one on one attention from my parents than any of the others got, because there were three of them clustered together!  Growing up as a single child can have good and bad aspects to it.  I hope you can find comfort in the good!\n\nI think you need to talk with your parents and tell them how hurtful it is when they talk about your birth as if it was a mistake.  Your dad probably wasn't even thinking when he said it, hopefully more in a joking manner?  My parents always made me feel loved because mom would say \"none of you were really planned!\" and she meant it in jest!  I was born in the era before birth control was a big thing, and raised in a Catholic family where the only method of birth control was the \"rhythm\" method, of counting the days when a couple was most fertile and try to avoid those times.  We see how well it worked out for them!  LOL  I am pretty sure it's STILL the only method approved in a very strict religion, but none of us ever followed that.  \n\nYou were no mistake, but you need to tell your family how it makes you feel when they say such insensitive comments!", "Definitely NTA. I think your mom is likely upset because part of her worried that you'd feel that way being born so late after your siblings. My little brother was born once over decade after me and I know he grew up feeling alone. I feel badly for it, but hopefully it meant he got more quality time with our mother.", "NTA. saying you were lonely as a kid isn\u2019t saying that your parents or siblings were horrible. idk why they got upset.", "NTA ... you were basically an only kid .... they just hadn't thought about it.", "NTA.", "NTA this is valuable insight from you. Not your fault you have a gap", "NTA. You were basically an only child if you didn't have a relationship or speak much with your siblings for almost half of your childhood. You didn't say what you said to be hurtful, it's the truth. They only feel bad because they feel guilty for not having a better relationship with you. Instead of dwelling on the past they should just get over it and try to improve your relationship now.", "NTA. \n\nMy husband and I had children between the ages of 13 and 21 when our little surprise was born. She is now an adult. We often talk about how different things were for her. Her brothers love her but they were more like uncles than brothers because of the age difference. (Because she is so much younger, I imagine when she turns fifty, they will still think of her as a little girl!).", "NTA\n\nYou have every right to your feelings. Your mother should have realized that the age difference put a distance between you and your siblings. I think she just doesn't want to face up to that fact, even though no one is to blame for it.\n\nDon't apologize for sharing your truth. Tell your mom you still love her, but that pretending you felt differently won't change history.", "NTA\n\nAccording to Dr Kevin Leman, author of the Birth Order book, birth order resets after around 5 years - so two children with more than a 5 year gap will tend to both feel and behave like only children.\n\nIt's not a hard and fast rule, just a tendency. But yeah, your feeling is valid.", "NTA\nMy brothers are 12 and 14 years older then me. I never felt like an only child because they were around a lot (one brother actually lived next door). But I do understand feeling lonely because of it. They always had each other growing up but I didn\u2019t have that. Even now when we\u2019re all in the same stage of life their relationship is different. They spend a lot of time\nTogether going to the movies and stuff but just the two of them. I get it\u2019s their thing but it still sucks to never get invited.\n\nEdit - typo", "NTA. All you did was express why you agreed with them having a kid sooner. I\u2019m sorry you were shamed for expressing your reality.", "Nta- dude, I grew up an only child on a farm in the middle of nowhere. Played hours of catch against the barn door.  There are worse things than growing up an only child.", "NTA\n\nIt's not her fault but she's harboring some weird guilt about it.  Has nothing to do with you and you don't have to lie about reality to cover for it.", "**NTA**   Your mom would just prefer to believe that she wasn't part of the problem.  you didn't make your siblings feel bad, you gave them a reason to think about family dynamics.  Your mom wants to rug sweep that's why she teared up.   What has your dad said to in the aftermath?", "NTA", "this is tricky but my assessment is NTA. from their point of view, it might sound weird. they remember you from the more \"recallable\" parts of their childhood so they think of you as their kid sibling. you don't have those memories and then they moved out while you were still a kid, so it felt like you were alone for your recallable childhood.\n\ni was 7 whenmy sister was born so i remember her whole life. that's 13 years of memories with her in my childhood before i moved out.\nif she only clearly remembers me from the age of 7-ish on then that's 6 years of me being her sibling before i moved out. same 13 years of living together. but it will feel different between us.\n\nnothing wrong with acknowledging that perspective. i can understand how people who didn't grow up like that feel like it's rude, but it's the truth. there are times when it feels like i'm the oldest sister, but that my sister is an only child.", "YTA, not for what you said, youre entitled to your feelings, but how you said it, words matter, phrasing matters, theres much more tactful ways to discuss how you felt about your upbringing without hurting your siblings, who had no say or control in it.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Now that they\u2019re adults, they\u2019re not on good terms. Each one feels like an only child because they never even went to the same school at the same time. They never played together.

They were all out of the house by the time I was 9 but even when we all lived together I had nothing in common with them. I'm only close to one of them now and they're more like a parent to me than a sibling.

You're entitled to your feelings,  but from their perspective, I could see why what you said could be hurtful. They seem like they never discounted you as a sibling. I get that the age gap is difficult growing up, but it's not that you were an only child. So NTA for how you feel, but YTA for how you said it I guess. I think it would have been enough to say that you felt like you couldn't connect with your siblings when you were young. Especially if you're close with them now. Like if they're sitting there thinking everything was fine between the three of you, only for you to say that you feel like you don't have siblings. It's a bit harsh I think.", "Respectfully I do kinda disagree on OP being TA for any of it. Them expressing that growing up they felt like an only child because of the age gap is very different than saying they feel like an only child now. Their siblings guilt is their own and guilt truly only manifests itself from some truth (my opinion). It\u2019s obvious they love their siblings and their feelings (like you said) are valid and make sense. I just don\u2019t think they were TA for expressing how their childhood felt to them, especially in the context. It could definitely help their siblings see the benefit of not waiting a long time if they\u2019re looking for another kid.", "I understand that to a point. I just don't see why the older siblings should feel guilty just for being older. There is a disconnect just from age differences. It's bound to happen. And it just seems to me that the OP saw the bond between their older siblings and felt lonely that they weren't able to have that growing up. That's not to say it's the fault of anyone in the family, so maybe I should've said NAH instead. But I also don't have siblings so, maybe I just see it from that perspective as opposed to someone having the knowledge that they do have siblings in their life, even if they're older. Like I said, mixed feelings lol\n\nEdit: though I definitely agree having kids close together in age is good advice lol", "I 100% agree with this! I also don\u2019t have older siblings so I don\u2019t understand that disconnect and I apologize if I made it sound like the siblings should feel guilty I was trying to say I don\u2019t think any guilt they feel should fall on OPs shoulders from their mother. But I definitely agree with you on this!", "No, not at all!. I just wasn't sure where you were coming from when you said guilt comes from truth in this situation. Like in any other context, I'd be like yeah, definitely. But I was over here like wait a minute lol. but no, no one should feel guilty. I was just trying to say I could understand why the older siblings could have been hurt by the op's statement if they were.", "Nta.

My brother and I are great friends! But until I was out of college, we... really did not have much in common. Developmentally, we were always in super different stages of life. \n\nIt's okay to acknowledge stuff like this.

They are all a lot closer to each other because 4 of them only have a year between each of them. The two youngest are only a year apart too. I was grown, gone, and married in college when the youngest was 8. I wish I knew them but it can\u2019t be helped. They have their own little group and our life experiences were/are just so different. We have nothing in common. I feel left out even when we are all together.

You weren't trying to be edgy until truth to hurt people and say that was just you being honest. Your perspective was relevant to the conversation. You were not an asshole for sharing it just sounds like your mother and father are freely able to discuss how they wish they hadn't had you so late, and your siblings are able to share how they didn't like their relationship with you, but somehow you aren't supposed to share what your view of life is", "NTA - I had a moment like this last time the family was together. My aunt (family friend) had passed away and I sent flowers to my uncle and condolences to my cousins. My sister and brother were pissed I didn't show to the funeral. Aside from the fact it was 3000km from me, during covid lockdown and after I had just moved across the country, they were pissed I didn't do more. I asked them why they thought I was close to anyone in that family? I pointed out that I was always cast aside when I was young. They would play outside as a group but I was too small so I could get hurt(football and such, totally accurate) and then when I was big enough they had all grown out of kids activities. I was present at everything they were but I was sitting in the back or in another room while they had family time. I am sorry my aunt passed but I am no closer to her children than the strangers on my street. They have both been pissed for years.

Out of her 4 older siblings one one of them had anything to do with her.", "It just sounds like they don't want to hear the poster's perspective. Like they were all sharing their views on the situation, but hearing from the person that they view as the other is not welcome. The parents are allowed to say that they don't like the age gap, the older siblings are allowed to say they don't like the age gap, it sounds like the unintended child is just supposed to be thankful that they exist and not say anything", "I was thinking that it's possible that although OP felt pretty lonely growing up because they didn't have siblings to do stuff *with*, their siblings did actually do a decent amount of stuff *for* them.\n\nStuff like, I don't know, buying them presents or taking them to the zoo or something. Stuff that wouldn't really substitute for having siblings your age around but would require care and effort on their siblings' parts.\n\nIn which case they might be sorta offended if they think OP doesn't appreciate them. Which wouldn't make OP an asshole but it would probably be a good idea to check in with them and stuff."]}
