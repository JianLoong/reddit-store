I'm not crazy about her decision to eat meat, but I know her dad would be really disappointed and upset by it. Yet, he wouldn't go berserk, and I'm sure eventually he'd come around to the idea.\n\nBut, the other day, our son told us our daughter asked him to housesit her apartment for a few weeks and asked for our opinion on whether he should. One of the things I considered is whether he'd want to use the pots/pans she uses to cook meat in, so I figured to just let the cat out the bag and tell my husband about the \"big secret.\"\n\nLater, our son said yes to housesitting, we came over to help him move in, and while we were there, my husband mentioned he knows about her meat-eating and asked why she hid it for so long. She told us our son had already told her of my \"revelation\", yet didn't have a quality answer to her dad's questions and became visibly irritated.\n\nTo me, the whole \"hiding\" was ridiculous and nearly childish, and it was not a big deal to tell.

Sounds like dad was grilling her about her decision. Which would answer the question of why l she didn\u2019t say anything.

What's the problem?", "YTA \n\n\nNo idea why she tells you secrets....well, that'd end. \n\n\nShe didn't want to tell her dad. In no way does that have anything to do with you.", "For 25 years,  you and your husband controlled your daughter's diet. She finally got to make her own decisions because she moved out.  This shouldn't be a big deal but obviously your husband has made his daughter feel like she can't tell her father she isn't a vegan anymore.  Your issue should be with him for making your daughter feel ashamed of making decisions for herself.  YTA", "YTA. You and yiur husband sound horrible. Ypur adult son doesn't need you to help 'move in' for house sitting. \n\nYour daughters pabs aren't going to poison anyone, and you don't need to be snooping through her freezer.", "YTA. Frankly it's concerning that your daughter was so terrified of your husband's reaction that she refused to tell him something. That speaks to way bigger problems and the fact that you just casually dismiss it is upsetting. Also,  your daughter's house is not your house,  you have no right to snoop on her like you did.  And now that your daughter knows neither you nor your husband can be trusted,  don't be surprised if she grey rocks you.", "YTA why you snooping in her freezer? You\u2019ve successfully created an environment where your adult child is afraid to disclose aspects of their life - well done. That\u2019s not your information to share, so why did you feel the need to bring the pans up in front of everyone? That should have been done privately - if your son even cares. Sounds like the vegans are you both and it\u2019s been force onto everyone else.", "Yta. First. This shouldn't be some big reveal. The fact that she thought she had to hide this speaks volumes on the kind of household she grew up in. The correct response from both parents should have been I'm sorry I ever made you feel like you couldn't tell me something. Dietary choices are personal. You and your husband raised your children on your dietary preferences. As an adult she decided she didn't want to be vegan.", "YTA - It\u2019s not a difficult case: she asked you to keep a confidence, nobody was being hurt, yet you blabbed. While you may not be the worst mother of the year, you are certainly it someone she should trust to keep a secret.", "YTA. \n\nThe fact that she needed to hide it in the first place speaks volumes to you both as parents, more him. \n\nThe fact that he confronted her about it and kept asking her questions and getting aggressive and demanding answers says abusive and controlling behavior. \n\nOne\u2019s diet is a choice. You were not giving her a choice. \n\nAnd your excuse to tell him because your son would use the pots and pans makes no sense. If they\u2019re washed they\u2019re fine. You just wanted to tell him hoping he can coerce her back. \n\nYou just made sure to never to privy to her life except with very basic things. Congratulations", "YTA. You guys make vegans look bad.", "If you have to hide the fact you eat meat and dairy from a parent, that parent is emotionally abusive.", "YTA. Why is it even your business?  And why is she afraid to tell her father? Does he get violent or explosive when he gets news he dislikes?", "You go in her freezer to check what\u2019s in it, apparently so you can rat her out? Huge YTA\n\nEdit: funny typo", "YTA. Your daughter promptly decided to be herself as soon as he left home. Because you didn't let her till then. This is exactly what I did too as soon as I was 'free'. My mother had banned salad seasoning from both my and my brother's diet because **I**, liked vinegar. She liked to show me how even my brother was forced to eat oil-only salad.  \nThe first thing I did when I left home, was to buy a bottle of it and make myself a salad.  \nBut then when she came to visit with my brother, she had brought ingredients for a salad and showed me how my brother's share was oil-only. With a smirk.  \nMy mother was a narcissist who needed to control everything about her whole family.\n\nYou're the same, and you're as manipulative, because yes, I can read through your lies too. The pans are nothing else than a pretext. That's what you people, do.", "YTA, enjoy the limited contact your daughter will undoubtedly begin.", "YTA. \n\nWhat would you have considered a \"quality answer\" to your husband's questions? \n\nWhy does she owe your husband ANY answer to his questions at all? She's an adult in her own place. The only answer she needs is \"I'm not vegan because I don't want to be vegan.\" If he has more questions after she says that, then the problem isn't that her answers lack quality; it's that your husband is asking questions when he shouldn't be.", "YTA. Your daughter was never vegan, you forced an extreme diet onto a child and the minute she got her own home she starting eating traditional food. What a crock of shit. You and your husband need to mind your own dinner plate and stop forcing this nonsense onto your kids. Your daughter can decide what she wants to eat without your input, just like every other human over the age of 10.", "Yta and yeah, wtf, why were you in her freezer?!? You don't just randomly go into other people's freezers! It's weird. Leave the poor kid alone!  You'd think she had admitted to cooking meth, not eating cheese!", "YTA the least you could have done was give her a heads up. I\u2019m glad your son has some decency. My mom used to do shit like this - snoop, find something and wait for me to come home to confront me. Even though we didn\u2019t get along, my sister would give me a heads up so I didn\u2019t walk into an ambush.", "Info: Was there any reason she'd be afraid of backlash?", "YTA. It was her secret to tell, when she was ready.\n\nShe also doesn't have to have a 'quality' answer to why. Her wanting to eat meat is a good enough answer. \n\nThe real issue here is why is she so afraid of her dad.", "YTA you are the reason vegans have a bad name. Making your daughter have to hide the fact she eats meat like she is hiding that she is gay in Saudi Arabia. Exact reason you preach vegans get a bad wrap.", "Honestly, you and your husband might want to look at how you treat your daughter if she, a grown ass woman, is afraid of telling her dad something as simple as she's eating meat.", "YTA because your daughter feels like she needs to hide her eating. You can follow whatever eating you want but it's obvious your kid didn't feel like they had a choice and did it to make you happy. Your son might feel the same way, that's why he was happy to house sit knowing there were forbidden foods in the house.", "why do you care.\n\nits her belly, she can decide what she wants", "YTA.  Why are you in her freezer?   Quality answer to his questions?  Geesh, I hope she never lets you guys inside of her home again.", "YTA for making vegans look bad.", "YTA.\n\nAlso stop being a snooper.", "YTA. There was no reason for you to tell, your son wouldn\u2019t have gone to vegan hell for using a pan he had no idea had previously been used to cook meat. Nor would it have tainted him in some way. Especially since it would have been washed.", "YTA. It seems pretty obvious why she hid it from her father, that he's a 'big reactor', which implies loud and angry. The fact that she had to do this as an adult is really embarrassing for you and him.", "YRA - for allowing her to be scared to eat meat. Biggest TA for thinking it\u2019s okay to break a promise and not keep a secret. The vegan\u2019s I know, would be a shame to hear about vegans like you. Actually made your daughter feel the sheet because she eats meat. This is one problem I have in life is watching people force their beliefs on other people. Then making them scared to think of me.", "Yta if he won't even use the same pots that, at one point, had meat, then he's 100% going to be an asshole about her not being vegan. \n\nHope he doesn't have a smart phone as many screens have cow products in them.", "YTA - Don't snoop and prepare for your daughter to no longer share many aspects of her life with you going forward.  \n\nShe was raised with your ideology and now she needs to make the decision for herself on what she believes or not.", "YTA\u2026 if it isn\u2019t a big deal and she was being childish in \u2018hiding\u2019 she is no longer vegan, why did you tell your husband and son? Not being a vegan anymore is not some big deal, life threatening crime type secret right?", "YTA! Why doesn't your daughter feel safe enough to talk to your husband. Says a lot about the family life, tbh. You may want to take some time to reflect on that. This whole situation should not have been a big deal.", "YTA! Not your truth to tell. Your daughter would have told her father when she was ready too.\n\nFor you it may seem ridiculous but for her it wasn't. This was not your place. Snooping around in your daughter's freezer is a big-time invasion of privacy for your daughter.\n\nShe is an adult. The choices of not being vegan and not telling your husband, are hers and hers alone. You have literally betrayed the trust your daughter put in you. I hope you realise that and apologize to her.", "YTA  You clearly enforced your veganism on her so badly she is afraid even as an adult to go against it.   Your son and daughter didn't turn vegan a 0 and 6 years old YOU DID.\n\nNo wonder every hates vegans your insufferable.", "YTA - if your child is out in the world and living independantly, it is not your (or your husband's) business what they eat. More importantly, it is also not the right of vegans to get upset at people who choose to eat meat. After all, we meat eaters don't give a crap what anyone else eats. If you have to tiptoe around your husband on the subject of his own child eating animal products then he is an asshole as well.", "YTA. She knows that you can't be trusted.", "Yta, this should be considered child abuse.", "Fucking vegans.", "That's a crap cleaning issue though, not a pan usage one?  Given soap and hot water, you can clean allergen traces perfectly fine.", "Yta for telling your husband. But I do think it\u2019s something your son should know if he was still eating vegan. Pots and pans can have things cooked in them absorb into the lining and release when cooked in again. Washing it is not going to get it up to cooking temperature. I\u2019ve had several friends with celiac disease have to get new pans because the ones they had were non stick and they were still getting sick from them.", "Proof that not only are vegans nuts, but it may be infectious. \n\nYTA and so is your daughter.", "NAH. I can see why she didn't want to go there with her dad by you saying your husband is the more reactive of the two, but expecting you to lie for over a year is just too much. I'm a firm believer in owning your shit and sure as hell not expecting others to lie for you. I don't really understand the situation with the pans as washing them should fix the issue (or I would think so anyway), but I know some vegans are very particular, so maybe it's reasonable in your family for your son to be aware of it. Maybe you were just sick of having to keep a secret from your spouse, which is fair since it sounds like disappointment is the worst she'd face. I  know disappointing someone you love can be a great motivator for a lot of people to lie, tho. I definitely feel she leans more toward the AH than you do just for how long she made you an unwilling accomplice.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

What was once dirty is now clean, and its uncleanliness is banished XD", "Glad I could help! And that's why I ramble about OCD sometimes lol", "Clean if you wash and sterilize them properly, sure. Which most people do not do.", "Ooookay now really sure how we were supposed to know your life story, but go off, I guess.\n\nI think you're confused though. You don't live in my house.", "She doesn't have to, she's an adult. It's not his business what she eats.", "This along with how you treated your daughter gives major helicopter parent vibes. She shouldn\u2019t be afraid to tell your family she\u2019s not a vegan anymore, and you shouldn\u2019t be snooping in her stuff. Sounds like you forced veganism on her until she finally moved out.", "Six weeks? That's not even two months!! I moved for 6 months with two suitcases, which contained my laptop. Alone. And I'm a tiny woman.", "Just to say goodbye?\n\nIs yr son housesitting the Space Station? It\u2019s six weeks and a suitcase not low earth orbit. They\u2019re adults, let them be.", "You did it so your husband could have a confrontation with your daughter and I think you knew this all along", "We're discussing BOILING it. The discussion is ABOUT cleaning it.", "Fun fact! You can get sick from human waste products that you can't with other animal waste products! They aren't the same!", "Fun fact! Not relevant to the conversation!", "It most absolutely is! We are talking about safety of using something that contained human waste vs something that contained animal products - they are not equivalent.\n\nMaybe you are having some other conversation that we are not having, I don't know", "Both are perfectly safe.\n\nThe same way your hands are safe after they've been in your vagina taking said cup out. \n\nCan you just leave then? Because your rambling is obnoxious."]}
