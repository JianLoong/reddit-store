Kids, dog the lot. \n\nMy husband is the definition of Manchild. And he\u2019s terrible with looking after his things. For instance, his brand new pushbike he left outside work unlocked and it was stolen 4 days after he got it. Every mobile phone he\u2019s ever had (somewhere around 6/7) he\u2019s broken in one way another. Dropped it, sat on it, fell into a vat of boiling water at work \u2026 the list goes on. His laptop after 6 months randomly stopped working too! \nMe, I\u2019m the opposite. I\u2019m careful with my things cause I don\u2019t want to have to replace them. Like most people. I have an iPad, which he uses. An iPad that has now a smashed screen and glitches on occasion which he claims he had nothing to do with (insert eye roll here) an iPad that incidentally I used to use for work until it was broken. I also have a mobile phone that I\u2019ve had 4 years without a single scratch and my MacBook Pro. \n\nWhen I got my MacBook Pro, I did say that no one, and I mean no one was to touch or use it. Especially without asking first. It has a lot of important stuff on it and I use it for work too. \nI came home from a trip yesterday and saw my husband sat on the sofa with it watching a movie with our 9 year old son. I didn\u2019t say anything at the time, I waited till later and simply said \u201cplease don\u2019t use my laptop. You use everything else but please just not my laptop\u201d he got annoyed and said I was being possessive about an object. I pointed out he could of used the option to watch the movie on the tv through the iPad. \n\nThis morning, my husband announces the screen on his mobile phone, a replacement phone I gave him (it was my old one) for the phone he had before that smashed. (Shocker I know) well the current phone screen is black even though it\u2019s turned on. So it\u2019s buggered. He then announces that he\u2019s taking the iPad to work with him to listen to music and use on his break. The already broken and fragile iPad that I paid for! I said it was a bad idea and it\u2019ll only end up more broken. He works in a busy kitchen with lots of people coming in and out. He said he would look after it and I pointed out he\u2019s never looked after anything else and that\u2019s why everything he\u2019s had is broken. He threw the iPad on the sofa and stormed out saying I was being an asshole. \n\nSo am I? I paid for that iPad 4 years ago to use at work. And yes I refused to pay for it to be fixed because I got my MacBook instead and decided if I really wanted to I\u2019ll buy an updated iPad if needs be.\n\n\nEDIT : \nTo those saying why have I stayed married for so long to him or choosing to stay married to him. Because we are married, we made a commitment and we are in love even after 15 years. So carelessness aside,  to leave a somewhat happy marriage and break up an entire family for something realistically small would be stupid in my eyes. Sure it\u2019s frustrating and annoying as hell, but marriages require work and compromises and sometimes disagreements to make then work. I\u2019ve been married previous and it was a truly awful marriage. But the one I\u2019m in, is filled with a whole lot of love. I just also happen to want to throttle him from time to time. He\u2019s not controlling, not abusive, never looked at another woman. He talks to everyone at work about me and our kids to the point everyone knows me before I meet them and they all tell me how proud he is of his family. He texts me repeatedly during the day to tell me he loves me and asks how my day is. He has raised an autistic child from 1 years old that wasn\u2019t his but tells everyone he is and goes to his school events to cheer him on. So would I really leave him all because he\u2019s shit with looking after stuff?", "created_utc": 1688461922, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14qa1q4/aita_for_not_letting_my_husband_use_my_stuff/", "score": 81, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
