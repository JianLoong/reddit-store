I find it difficult to believe that that\u2019s culturally acceptable.\nIf they had asked you to agree to the money being used it would be different.(although still not great given the power imbalance)\n\nAnd I would have thought that intentionally disrespecting the dead would be a no-no in most cultures.\n\nYou aren\u2019t \u2018 airing  family business in public\u2019. You are dealing with a theft. Your parents are the ones who chose to lie and steal, they have only the same to blame that their actions have caught up with them.\n\nAnd yes, relying s formal, binding, legal contract in place to withdraw your legal claim is essential. You are not being an AH . If your brother is honest and trustworthy then there is no reason for him to object, if he isn\u2019t, there is every reason to get it formally drawn up.", "NTA. Good luck to you, and I hope the courts award you the full amount plus interest and damages. Culture, or not, that\u2019s a horrible abuse of your aunt\u2019s inheritance and blatant disregard for your future.", "What?  THEY put money ahead of family.\n\nStealing your money was more important than your future!\n\nThey can pay it all back.  NTA\n\nPs - also speak to your lawyer about actions that prevent them from getting rid of their assets or putting them in another family member\u2019s name before the case is heard .  Maybe you can get a lien put on the house?", "NTA. The only shame here goes to your parents and the rest of your family.", "Enough that both my sister and I could have finished our undergraduate degrees without debt.", "Me too!", "It wasn't just money. It was a rejection of her right to an education.  It was prioritizing him over her. It was theft.\n\nSue or legally binding contract   - yup, those are the choices.", "Exactly this. They took OP\u2019s college money and then basically said \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f. NTA", "This and also i (if you haven't done it already) would try to look for written statements and records (before your parents might get rid of it) how much money you were supposed to get. Not that they say they only used 2 thousand or some stuff.", "The student law center at my university is helping me with everything. I have proof that the money was mine. I am trying to do everything I can so this does not become a criminal matter.", "NTA..\n\n\nDay light robbery is what it is!!!", "Agree! And would definitely consult the lawyer about the brother\u2019s offer to pay. I would worry receiving money would be a taxable gift and her brother not taking that into account.", "Perfectly summed up!", "She's not the one who put money ahead of family though. Her parents did.", "He got probably got angry because he doesn't want to be held legally responsible if he doesn't pay it all back.", "I was a legal assistant, and yes, this is probably true. Any lawyers available to weigh in?", "No, if his reaction to a contract was that severe then she absolutely needs a contract.  Contracts aren't horrible things they are written agreements that prevent infighting and disagreements later.  The only person that would be opposed toa contract over $$ is someone who wasn't intending on honoring the agreement in the first place.", "Why would she need to apologize to her brother.  He stole her money.", "Her family \"burned the bridges\" when they stole from her. OP isn't burning any bridges. She's just barbecuing on the flames.", "I'm getting help from my university. I guess I'm not the first student with this problem.", "NTA get your money back, your aunt left that money for you", "I hope you're successful. Good luck!", "Fair enough", "Oh I mean a contract isn't enough. Cash in hand or put his name on the loan so the bank will take his assets if he doesn't pay.", "My understanding is that her parents stole her money and gave it to her brother. He's offering it back despite this not being his fault.", "I totally get that. But, I have been terribly wronged by family in the past, and for lack of a better term, they \"burned the bridge.\" But, because I chose to forgive and seek a relationship with them, we eventually reconciled, they apologized, made it right, and we are close once again. I'm just saying there can be two sides to burning a bridge, but every case is different. I understand that.\n\nedit: ~~\"there are two sides\"~~ to \"there can be two sides\"", "OPs family isn't looking for forgiveness, though. They just want OP to drop it and shut up about them STEALING and impacting OPs future. They haven't apologized or admitted any fault, they just want to sweep it under the rug and get mad if OP brings it up again"]}
