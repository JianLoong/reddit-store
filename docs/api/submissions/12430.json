I'll never understand how anyone could justify spending money on a wedding vs education!", "But it was their SON'S wedding - so they didn't give a shit that they were depriving their daughter of a debt-free education paid for by her auntie.", "Not even OP's wedding", "Possibly even more, they took the sister\u2019s money too!", "My daughter did a small DIY wedding.  They had a friend with a small venue that they let them use for free and in the end I think we spend about $4000.  That included a beautiful wedding dress and the 3 bridesmaids dresses that were a beautiful royal blue and could be worn again to formal/simi formal events.", "Me and my OH are getting married next year, for ceremony, 40 people to eat and drink, DJ, 80 person buffet and our room for the night, its costing us \u00a33500... my dress is about \u00a3200, his suit about the same. I really don't understand paying $30,000 on a wedding?? Are weddings just so much more expensive in the USA?", "If you don't count rings, we did my wedding for less than $1k.", "30k?\n\nWe\u2019ve been putting ours off for years, and are hoping to wrap it up with 3k.", "So, uhhhhhh\u2026don\u2019t do it.\n\nWe spent a few hundred dollars on our wedding 30 years ago, dress, pictures, AND restaurant dinner and never regretted skipping all the unnecessary stuff.  We had the close family and friends we wanted there and no one else.", "I met my husband while I lived in the bush in Alaska (off the road system, ALL supplies were either flown in or barged in during the summer). We decided to get married in Florida so my grandparents who live there could attend. I was struggling though with how the hell we'd be able to plan a wedding from thousands of miles away. \n\nSo my husband did some research and found the perfect solution for us -- we got married on a party yacht. $110/person for venue, catering, full bar, DJ, officiant, cleanup, the works!  The cake, flowers, and photographer were the only things we really needed to book separately.  \n\nIt was so easy, it was lovely, and it was super inexpensive compared to just venue costs in the same area, even though it still cost us almost $20k total (flights and rehearsal dinner, etc., included). \n\nI was anxious about the total cost, but my husband insisted. I had been a teen mom and high school dropout. I put myself through college and law school and never really got to celebrate my accomplishments (because I was so very poor \ud83d\ude2c). He said he was making up for that with this big event. It meant so much \ud83d\udc97 and we had a wonderful time with our friends and family. \n\nI totally understand your POV. Just explaining why context and individual experiences might contradict the premise \ud83d\ude0a", "That's fortunate I guess? Most caterers in our area cost at least $100/pp without booze. Figure rental costs of $20/pp, booze cost of $35, and we're already at twice your budget for a similarly sized event without a venue or anything else.\n\nCosts can vary wildly around the states.", "I'm in the same neighborhood as you in NY, and when I got married in 2008 (now divorced tho) I had mine at the gardens at FDR (I wanted the Rose Gardens at Vanderbilt but they were closed for renovations that summer).since it was a national park it cost me about $300 for the \"venue\". We did have a catered thing at a private room in a restaurant afterwards that definitely upped the price, but it definitely saved lots of money on an amazing amount of flowers (we had a few small centerpieces as well as my and 2 bridesmaids bouquets and boutonnieres). We also got disposable film cameras and had everyone take natural pictures. My mom and sibling are excellent photogs, so they also got some gorgeous shots of the ceremony itself. It was nice, small and low-key, what I personally prefer. But if I ever get married again, eloping is what I'm gonna do lol! Good luck on the planning of your wedding. Sometimes you're able to find a gem, that still doesn't cost too much! \n\nEdited to add: One of my best friends got married at Millbrook Winery and had pizza truck catering, and a tonne of appetizers. It was a gorgeous, outdoor ceremony (in October), but they still had a beautiful indoor area for the reception. I couldn't recommend it enough.... Although idk how much it cost and also it was 5 years ago.", "Depending on the culture it can be really dangerous so I will preface my below comment with a caution to please stay safe and be aware of the potential danger you could be facing! \nNTA. First let me say you are so courageous for moving out getting student loans and going to college!! You have your great aunt's determination! They weren't too ashamed to steal money from you.  You are a source of 'shame' to them- that's a lie. A lie they were depending on you to believe so they can manipulate you into doing what they wanted you to do. They were depending on guilt tripping you into remaining silent.  Get your money. Your brother is also a liar lol you knew that though which is why you wanted a legally binding contract. He is trying to guilt you into believeing him and dropping it. But if he is being honest, why wouldn't he sign the agreement? Bc he never had any intentions of honoring it!  Get whatever you can and remove the toxic people out of your life!", " if he planned on honoring the contract, then why would he be bothered by the contract?", "Please do not ever go back to your home country because I worry they would try to kidnap you or worse to make you drop the lawsuit. Do everything you can to fight for your future. Your aunt would be setting their lives on fire if she knew what they did to you. This is a great injustice and a crime. This is EXACTLY what she wanted to prevent. You are NTA. In this case, understanding the culture has nothing to do with being able to 'appreciate' or understand your parents actions. The only thing to understand is that they took advantage of you and stole your future. You deserve to get it all back. I wish you the best of luck.", "tbh in desi culture, women are now generally well educated outside of very rural areas maybe. education there in general is highly valued and, at least these days, I don\u2019t hear of many Indian families who encourage their girls to have kids right away and not study. (like, maybe in my grandmother\u2019s day, but my mom and all aunts did post-secondary and some even did grad school.) and I believe there\u2019s a high proportion of women that go into STEM at least compared to women in more western countries.", "Your sister should sue as well, even if she didn't go to college. It was hers.", "NTA. My step daughters mom stole $18,000 from her college fund. My husband had to take his exwife to court to get it back. Twice. \n\nYour aunt is so proud of you and is cheering you on from the other side! \ud83d\udc95  (in fact, I am proud of you too even though I don\u2019t know you. Excellent job of sticking up for yourself!)", "Since when does groom family pay a wedding?  And to cost so much to wipe out 2 college savings accounts?\n\nParents are liars as well as thieves.  They spent money on themselves or gave it to golden son to buy a house", "He doesn't have the money, that's why he refused the contract, he had 0 intention to pay her back", ">they had an illusion of wealth in their community\n\nThis is a great point that never even crossed my mind\n\n>They're ashamed that they couldn't afford that party, not that they couldn't afford it without stealing from their own kid.\n\nWHOOMP there it is", "And to not offer to pay back every cent is wild.", "NTA. They should feel ashamed, they STOLE from you.", "I would be surprised if he intended to even make a first payment.", "Blimey, I\u2019m in the wrong line of work.\n\nI should be an acrobat.", "Lol the actual acrobats don\u2019t get paid that much, maybe $300-$500 a night, depending on what the client orders.  Then I get paid as an event manager for the evening (loading in and setting up equipment, making sure the performers are fed and have the costumes they need ect) and get $35/hr.  There can be anywhere from 3 of us at a small gig to 12 of us at big gigs.  The I also make costumes where I get paid $20/hr.  The place I work has its own shop where we make all the costumes custom so customers can order a really specific theme if they want.  For example last year a bride wants acrobatic performing dinosaurs so we made so hella sexy sparkley dinosaurs.  They looked great and client was really happy!", "If it's an Indian wedding (multi day extravaganza), easily 6 figures", "I'm sorry for your loss.  Give your dad a big hug as well, give yourself a hug too", "Honestly, you\u2019re just selling me on this gig more.", "My mom's parents died when she was in college. Dad's mom did similar. Never broached the subject on my grandpa...he didn't really have much money... but he for sure paid it forward with us. $5 in a birthday card came with a $500 treasury bond for college, which I had no idea he did until applying for college.\n\nThat's probably why they did all this for us kids (by kids I mean I'm the youngest and 38)", "Heck, even in America there's still a pretty strong culture of \"men are more important than women.\" Not necessarily to this point, but a point.", "Most Vietnamese (in US) actually make money from the wedding, unless ur wife doesn\u2019t have many relative in the US.  I think our wedding was less than $30,000.  Her parents gave $10k and mine gave $10k.  There was a little more than 100 guest so each Asian person gave $100 that\u2019s an easy $10k+, closer relative/friends gave more.  The only non Asian guest were on my side, 12 co workers. \n\nI was Americanized so was worried about the big wedding but it all worked out"]}
