I manage a large number of people at my company, am constantly traveling and frequently get pulled in many directions throughout a given day. All in all, it's very easy for me to lose track of little details and forget something important because of all of this. I'm always looking for ways to use technology to mitigate these issues and be more organized.\n\nA couple years ago, our IT guy showed me how the new iphone has a scheduling system and you can set it to automatically do things like send a text at a specific time or when you arrive at a certain place. After learning how this works, I've come to use it fairly often.\n\nFor example, I have it set so when I leave the house in the morning, it texts my secretary that I'll be at the office in 10 minutes - I leave at varying times depending on if an executive needs to call me about something before I get to the office. This helps her schedule out the first couple hours of my morning when I set aside time to meet with account reps who need me to approve budgets, sign off on proposals, etc before getting to my own meetings and calls.\n\nI also started using it a lot in my personal life. My girlfriend really loves it when I text her in the morning and I'd sometimes get caught up in work and forget, so I started writing a personal text out to her in the evening and setting it to send out at some time the next morning, just a little note about how I hope she has a great day, wishing her good luck on a presentation she has, etc.\n\nMy mom is also a bit forgetful these days, so I'll frequently days in advance set up something like \"Hey mom, hope you're having a great day! Just wanted to make sure you remember it's \\[niece\\]'s birthday party tonight at 7, don't forget to bring cupcakes.\" to go out to her that afternoon around 4p.\n\nMore of the same with other things, like I'll have it text my secretary a few days before a client's birthday to ask her to send a gift, things like that. Overall I think it's been really helpful.\n\nLast week, I showed my brother how it all worked and suggested he could use it to help himself get more organized. He told my mom and girlfriend about how I use my phone to automate when I text them or send gifts, and now they're both really pissed at me. They both say they felt like I had been putting in so much effort to be thoughtful and caring despite how busy I am, but it's all just been a facade and I'm just using my phone to automate it all.\n\nI honestly don't think that's fair. Every message I sent them is something I wrote myself. Every reminder is there because I set it myself. I'm doing this because I felt bad that I had in the past missed these details, and I feel like I'm just using the phone to help me be more organized and thoughtful.

You could easily be like so many other busy professionals and just, not. And then constantly apologize for forgetting xyz because of your schedule.

I had an ex that would forget shit like birthdays and then get mad when I was hurt.

That's true and false all in one- it's false because that's just not how people's minds work sometimes, some people really do struggle with remembering dates etc. It's true to the extent that people do put more thought into acts of care towards people they love, which you ARE doing.

These are messages op wrote themselves the night before and just scheduled when it was sent. I.e. a feature available in almost every email client since Lotus Notes if not earlier because it's just a message on a timer.", "That's like what? 8 hours difference? Be careful because you'll probably end up with a concerned daughter asking herself why her parents are staying up late to text her good morning!", "OP was thinking of them, but they also have an entire life of their own and a high pressure career. This high maintenance bs is why I don't mind being selective about who I date.", "I think the way OP talks about this to them can probably smooth over the situation. \u201cYou are the most important part of my life, and I don\u2019t want my hectic days to stop my expression of that. So when I DO have time to stop and think, I use it to write a heartfelt message to you, and I set it up to have that message come to you when I think it will cheer you the most. I think about you all day, when I\u2019m in meetings and solving problems and driving I think about you, but I can\u2019t always get out my phone and express that. This is my way of being SURE you know I\u2019m thinking about you.\u201d", "Supplement not substitute. I like that. NTA", "Solution: no people in my life.", "It\u2019s so sad that you all are making excuses for, and validating, the thoughtless and forgetful people in this world. For those who have a disability that interferes with memory, that is obviously a different story. But for those who simply don\u2019t care enough to remember, that is just heartless. They SHOULD in fact care. It is sad that they don\u2019t.", "And you're talking out your ass. None of this was \"automated\" it was a scheduled task using notes op wrote themselves the night before. You're allowed to be busy, if your partner can't understand that or is THAT needy, it's not a healthy relationship in the first place.", "Yes! This is it exactly. Op is being thoughtful, but at n the wrong moment. They figured out how to make the timing work.\n\nNow I'm off to figure this out myself.", "Yes! And my calendar notifications aren't always enough, because it only reminds me once and if I don't think to check my pull down menu, I've missed it. So I use scheduled texts like OP, since my texts will pester me every 2 minutes till I look at it. Sometimes to other people, but often to myself. I use it to text myself every night at 9:45 PM during Christmas season to make sure our Elf on the Shelf \"goes back to the north pole.\" Or to make sure the tooth fairy visits that night. Or to remind myself Saturday morning to pack the sun umbrella because that soccer field is freaking HOT. It's so handy.", "Fellow ADHD-er here chiming in to say you can set Reminders to remind you according to location on the Reminder app if you have an iPhone. I link it to my grocery and meds list as well", "Not sure if you have an iPhone but there is a way to set it so certain reminders show up when you arrive at a specific location! I haven\u2019t successfully set it up yet but it seems like a great option!", "Who the hell is saying they don't care? They obviously do, otherwise they wouldn't be giving themselves a way to make sure they ***don't forget.***\n\nEdit: Here's the deal. Birthdays, anniversaries, holidays? Don't mean a damn thing to me; so I have a hard time remembering them. But they are important to the people I care about, so I set reminders and alarms and make sure -- for their sake -- that I am aware those things are coming. If you were to give me a pop quiz over birthdays and anniversaries in my immediate family; I *might* get 3/10, and that includes my own. But I haven't missed one in 30 years.", "Yup! I get a text when it\u2019s filled and I\u2019m like \u2018cool\u2019 \n\n*whooooosh*", "When it's literally the most important people of your life, you will care to remember their bdays automatically. You shouldn't need to rely on memory aids. If you do, you don't care enough.", "Since OP was sending *personalized* messages from *his own brain* and not a chat bot which is something else entirely, your titty argument falls apart. Also what difference does like an 8 hour sleep make? I'll counter your metaphor with one of my own, it's like OP was on a business trip in a different time zone, he meant every word he said in the messages, it was just received at a different time.", "There are time, you know.", "No one said he had to think about her in the morning.  \n\nMessage her when you think about her, morning, noon, or night.\n\nThinking about her in the morning and his phone initiating a process that results in him thinking about her are 2 very different things.  \n\nYou can argue that the way women emotionally feel about things isn't logical enough if you want to.", "I guess. I just don't get it. Like, if he had a note on his desk saying \"text your GF\" would that be similarly offensive?", "I think it\u2019s a slight YTA with regards to the mom/gf.\n\nThe reason your gf likes the good morning texts so much is because she thinks that you are taking time out of your busy morning to text her. That\u2019s lost with the scheduling app. Yes you have the best intentions but you are deliberately making it seem like you are remembering to text her in the moment when in reality that is not the case. If timing didn\u2019t matter to them you wouldn\u2019t have set the scheduled text messages you would\u2019ve just sent it after you drafted it up. But you knew that timing matters so you misrepresented the situation.\n\nWith somethings, it truly does need to be done in the moment for it to be meaningful. \n\nBut NTA with regards to the brother. As you tried to help him.", "NTA\nI think it\u2019s thoughtful. \nYou simply think of it ahead of time and get it delivered when the time is right. I\u2019m the end you thought of it and sent the message.", "Honestly after reading so many posts on this sub about people who can\u2019t be bothered to remember important dates because they\u2019re busy or have ADHD\u2026 NTA. You found a solution that works and you\u2019re still putting in thought and effort", "NTA. This is genius and I need this in my life. I have a diary which I essentially wrote deadlines to myself about (shopping for gifts, organising work stuff etc). This is just a digital version. This is peak organisation skills and something we drill into students to set up good study/work/life habits. NTA at all.", "YTA and dishonest.  I wouldn't like this to be done to me and I wonder if OP would like to be treated like this. There's a reason you started doing this for work. It's very cold and calculating.", "I think it\u2019s a discomfort with tech thing. My mom is like this. She sometimes forgets her grandkids\u2019 or in-laws\u2019 birthdays, and I will text her reminders. She is always grateful. Yet, when I suggested she put the birthdays into her phone calendar with an alert, she refused. Because to her, she shouldn\u2019t *need* tech to remind her of her loved ones\u2019 birthdays. Somehow that makes her a bad grandma? Yet it\u2019s perfectly ok if I remind her. Not logical.", "He is writing the messages personally and personalising them. The only automation is the time they are sent", "So don't remind mum of things she said she'd do and do it for her so she misses out on everything because she's old and forgets things sometimes?", "Exactly.  How many times have I written a message, forgot to send it, sent it a day later??  A lot.\nOP is NTA.", "Exactly. They are just mad about when he hits send at this point. NTA.", "I have the birthday and anniversary of everyone I care about in my iPhone. And yes, sometimes life gets so busy the 9:00 a.m. banner on my phone gives me a mental kick. It\u2019s especially helpful to remember I need to open one of my cash apps to send one of my grands their birthday money (which they prefer over unwanted/unneeded gifts from an out-of-touch Boomer.)", "It's also unreasonable for a woman to be upset with her boyfriend because he keeps suggesting solutions when she vents about things.  \n\nEmotions don't obey logic. \n\nIf he wanted to win he could just send the messages when he writes them.  That would be far better.  Hell, he could out-shine us all and send those messages plus a short \"Good morning, I love you\" when he thinks about her in the morning.  She would be obsessed", "Well. That is a different take.  I offered to pick up items for my mom when she was alive and she appreciated it.  Of course sometimes she would want to \u201cdo it herself\u201d  But in my case my mother was also busy and appreciated the offer.  I\u2019d do that 100x again if she were still with me.

Someone put it really well in the comments that they're probably upset because it breaks with the image they had created of the poster. Part of this is probably also learning the information from the brother. So I think I might be a peeved [sic] briefly after first learning about it but I think I would quickly see that's caring.\n\n>Me: Makes sense\n\n>Her: What do you think?\n\n>Me: I think it's fine.

I\u2019ve been wanting to do this forever!", "Technically it is lying by omission regardless of what you have said lol.\n\nLike facts wise, no opinions, op lied by omitting that they didn\u2019t make said text messages when they were sent.
