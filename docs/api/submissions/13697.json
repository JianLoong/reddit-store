{"id": 13697, "submission_id": "128dxo4", "title": "AITA for scheduling my text messages and gift reminders?", "selftext": "So my daily life is kind of a mess. I manage a large number of people at my company, am constantly traveling and frequently get pulled in many directions throughout a given day. All in all, it's very easy for me to lose track of little details and forget something important because of all of this. I'm always looking for ways to use technology to mitigate these issues and be more organized.\n\nA couple years ago, our IT guy showed me how the new iphone has a scheduling system and you can set it to automatically do things like send a text at a specific time or when you arrive at a certain place. After learning how this works, I've come to use it fairly often.\n\nFor example, I have it set so when I leave the house in the morning, it texts my secretary that I'll be at the office in 10 minutes - I leave at varying times depending on if an executive needs to call me about something before I get to the office. This helps her schedule out the first couple hours of my morning when I set aside time to meet with account reps who need me to approve budgets, sign off on proposals, etc before getting to my own meetings and calls.\n\nI also started using it a lot in my personal life. My girlfriend really loves it when I text her in the morning and I'd sometimes get caught up in work and forget, so I started writing a personal text out to her in the evening and setting it to send out at some time the next morning, just a little note about how I hope she has a great day, wishing her good luck on a presentation she has, etc.\n\nMy mom is also a bit forgetful these days, so I'll frequently days in advance set up something like \"Hey mom, hope you're having a great day! Just wanted to make sure you remember it's \\[niece\\]'s birthday party tonight at 7, don't forget to bring cupcakes.\" to go out to her that afternoon around 4p.\n\nMore of the same with other things, like I'll have it text my secretary a few days before a client's birthday to ask her to send a gift, things like that. Overall I think it's been really helpful.\n\nLast week, I showed my brother how it all worked and suggested he could use it to help himself get more organized. He told my mom and girlfriend about how I use my phone to automate when I text them or send gifts, and now they're both really pissed at me. They both say they felt like I had been putting in so much effort to be thoughtful and caring despite how busy I am, but it's all just been a facade and I'm just using my phone to automate it all.\n\nI honestly don't think that's fair. Every message I sent them is something I wrote myself. Every reminder is there because I set it myself. I'm doing this because I felt bad that I had in the past missed these details, and I feel like I'm just using the phone to help me be more organized and thoughtful. But they clearly don't see it that way and are acting like I betrayed them or something.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1680331741, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/128dxo4/aita_for_scheduling_my_text_messages_and_gift/", "score": 47, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You\u2019re still putting in the effort when you remember to message them, but just at a more convenient time for everyone. \n\nYou know that you\u2019ll likely forget to message at the appropriate time, so you found a way to still show you care even if you\u2019re busy.", "NTA\n\nWhile I\u2019m sure it does break the image that your mother and girlfriend had of you, all the messages were personalized.

You could easily get so used to this program you got going that you lose ability to consider them throughout your day.I think this is what your mom & gf fear/are mad about- that your are totally automating. Sure set some texts for important reminders, bigger events happening that week for them. But also keep in the habit of just sending a random text with no automation. Balance both. \n\nLastly, F your bro for telling them, what an absolute idiot d!ckhead. Definitely program F you bro reminders for him several times a day for several months.", "NTA like you say it's your words and you've put thought into things, just because you've set them on a timer should make no difference.

You write the messages yourself, you just send them at a different time. The reaction is childish. NTA", "NTA. I use scheduled messages all the time because it helps me manage my attention deficit. It has helped me be a much better friend, son, and person. If people are giving you crap for finding a way to help you be a good partner, then they are the assholes.

You're doing this because you've missed the details in the past. It's important for you to not forget anymore and you use your phone to do so. It's all personally written, not generated by your phone or looked up on the internet, so no NTA. It's actually smart and it's better than letting people down time after time because you're so busy.", "Easy NTA, you \\*are\\* making an effort, and both your mom and girlfriend are being absurd.", "NTA.\n\nEven though the messages sent are automated, you\u2019re still thoughtful enough to write them and plan out when you send them.\n\nI think that\u2019s really sweet actually. It\u2019s like if you plan a birthday gift for someone and it arrives a day early, no one will complain that they didn\u2019t get it on that exact day. \n\nNot sure what you\u2019ll say to mom and gf but you\u2019re NTA in my book.", "NTA.  For me, I'd appreciate the fact that you found a way to ensure you were being attentive.  I don't get the anger.", "Uh, is it really any different than you just texting them normally? If you had set a reminder for yourself to manually text them at that time, I guarantee they'd feel differently. If I want my girlfriend to drive safe on her way to work, why shouldn't I schedule a text for an hour before she starts? Better than thinking \"hey, I should text X at Y time\" and then forgetting about it. NTA", "NTA, but I unfortunately do see why your mom and girlfriend might have an adverse reaction at first. On the surface, it might sound to them like you are just pre-scheduling a whole backlog of messages to have sent out at random times so that you don\u2019t have to think about anything at all, but it doesn\u2019t sound like that\u2019s what you\u2019re doing. If anything, it sounds like you are trying to be really thoughtful. I wonder if they might come around if you try to explain your system to them in a better way.", "NTA. The automation *is* the effort to be thoughtful and caring. That's all that needs to be said.", "I have a paper diary so I can keep on top of things and I write notes there for birthdays, exams coming up, anniversaries of the date people lost a loved one (that sounds so morbid!) so that I remember to check in with people on days they really need it. You\u2019re just doing the high tech version and no-one has ever been upset that I wrote it down! NTA and I assume your brother has given them a slanted version (say that the Chatbot or something types the messages?). When they calm down, show them how much work goes into this - you have to think ahead enough to type out individual personalised messages and also set them up to go at the right time", "I think what you did is great. I\u2019m going to utilize this option. And you did put in the effort, they\u2019re your words. Your brother is the only asshole here\u2026maybe a little bit your mom and your girlfriend as they don\u2019t seem to appreciate your efforts. It\u2019s  actually a thoughtful gesture on your part.", "NTA", "NTA", "NTA - And actually really brilliant for my ADHD ass. Only problem is an old phone\u2026\n\nYou ARE making an effort. You are writing the text ahead of time, when you think about them, so you won\u2019t forget. \nThe words and the sentiments are all yours even if they were written some time before the texts are sent.", "NTA in fact I think quite the opposite. You put so much thought into making sure that they got recognized that you set it up to be an automatic part of your life. To me that's more thought than you just trying to remember to do it at random times. I wonder if they would be mad if they got flowers on a weekly basis because you set up automatic delivery and not because you just thought of them every week.", "You value the people in your life enough that you want them to feel cared about. \n\nI hate remembering that I need to respond to a text late at night because I don't know if they're asleep already, and I don't want to wake them. This is such a fantastic solution to forgetting it in the morning rush. They're still personalised. They're just scheduled to be received at a more ideal time. \n\nNTA", "Brilliant.", "Those people clearly will have a great career as dullest tool in the shed for sure", "Gasp! I have birthday reminders on my phone! Clearly I am heartless.", "But they are thoughtful, handwritten texts, they're just written a little while before OP sends them. Why would that be hurtful?"]}
