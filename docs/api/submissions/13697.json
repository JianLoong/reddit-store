I manage a large number of people at my company, am constantly traveling and frequently get pulled in many directions throughout a given day. All in all, it's very easy for me to lose track of little details and forget something important because of all of this. I'm always looking for ways to use technology to mitigate these issues and be more organized.\n\nA couple years ago, our IT guy showed me how the new iphone has a scheduling system and you can set it to automatically do things like send a text at a specific time or when you arrive at a certain place. After learning how this works, I've come to use it fairly often.\n\nFor example, I have it set so when I leave the house in the morning, it texts my secretary that I'll be at the office in 10 minutes - I leave at varying times depending on if an executive needs to call me about something before I get to the office. This helps her schedule out the first couple hours of my morning when I set aside time to meet with account reps who need me to approve budgets, sign off on proposals, etc before getting to my own meetings and calls.\n\nI also started using it a lot in my personal life. My girlfriend really loves it when I text her in the morning and I'd sometimes get caught up in work and forget, so I started writing a personal text out to her in the evening and setting it to send out at some time the next morning, just a little note about how I hope she has a great day, wishing her good luck on a presentation she has, etc.\n\nMy mom is also a bit forgetful these days, so I'll frequently days in advance set up something like \"Hey mom, hope you're having a great day! Just wanted to make sure you remember it's \\[niece\\]'s birthday party tonight at 7, don't forget to bring cupcakes.\" to go out to her that afternoon around 4p.\n\nMore of the same with other things, like I'll have it text my secretary a few days before a client's birthday to ask her to send a gift, things like that. Overall I think it's been really helpful.\n\nLast week, I showed my brother how it all worked and suggested he could use it to help himself get more organized. He told my mom and girlfriend about how I use my phone to automate when I text them or send gifts, and now they're both really pissed at me. They both say they felt like I had been putting in so much effort to be thoughtful and caring despite how busy I am, but it's all just been a facade and I'm just using my phone to automate it all.\n\nI honestly don't think that's fair. Every message I sent them is something I wrote myself. Every reminder is there because I set it myself. I'm doing this because I felt bad that I had in the past missed these details, and I feel like I'm just using the phone to help me be more organized and thoughtful.
