The wedding is going go on from after Christmas day to New Years as in my culture the weddings last several days.\n\nEveryone is happy and my in-laws love me but my fiance's sister however is less than happy about all of it for some reason. She has it in me for some reason from day one. My fiance used to be married previously and she prefers his ex (who I also get along well with).\n\nSister, let's call her A is very critical of the wedding. She first bought up how much money it costs and how it was a waste when the money could have gone towards more \"practical things\". My MIL shut her down saying how it was my first wedding even if it was my fiance's second and I deserve a good one.\n\nThen she started criticizing my wedding dress and jewellery saying it was extravagant and very \"showy and gauche\". Then A had a problem with dancing, saying she preferred the solemn church wedding my fiance had with her ex.\n\nAnd her latest attack is on the number of the wedding days. A has made snide remarks about how \"the wedding is costing more than her mortgage\", \"I can't believe you're going to do the wedding ceremonies for 5 days when there's so much people going without heating\" and \"it's very weird to have people dance to choreography\" and on and on and one she goes.\n\nBut this kind of wedding is all that I've dreamed of. It's NORMAL in my culture. Everyone in my country of origin has weddings like this. It's a huge cause of celebration.\n\nI think the straw that broke the camel's back was the idea that my fiance would be arriving on horseback for the main ceremony. \n\nA actually laughed out loud at this and said I was a controlling diva and that my fiance made the mistake of his life leaving his ex wife (she left him for another guy). \n\nWe have all tried to explain to her that it's not her place to say these things as we can have whatever kind of wedding we want. But A won't listen to her parents, brother or husband and started saying a lot of mean things to me over dinner last night.  I told her that if she hates the wedding so much she can just not come. A said that she and her husband won't be part of my \"spectacle\" anyway. \n\nMy fiance at this point interjected and said that her husband is my fiance's friend from Uni so he's definitely coming. A then just started crying left to her room.\n\nNow the problem is I really love my in laws and and I don't want to put them in a spot by basically making them take sides with their children.\n\nAlso A's husband is also a good friend and would see the whole thing blown over soon. Fiance's adamant on sister not coming now and is calling her \"small-minded and bigoted\".

She did that to herself and got what she deserved!", "NTA. I\u2019m making an assumption here that you\u2019re Indian or from a similar background (I\u2019m half middle eastern and we also have multi-day extravagant wedding ceremonies), and your fianc\u00e9 and his family are not. It sounds like your SIL\u2019s objections to your cultural traditions are bigoted. I\u2019m not sure why she even wants to participate if she has such a huge problem with you and your culture.", "NTA\n\nEnjoy your week and congratulations.", "NTA - She\u2019s projecting and sounds like a miserable person. If she doesn\u2019t like what you\u2019re doing for your wedding then she doesn\u2019t have to come, simple as that. And why would you want someone so negative and critical there anyways?", "NTA.  Invite A's husband, ask her to stay home if she can't support you and her brother having the wedding YOU BOTH want and keep her opinions to herself.", "Sounds like she is nothing bit jealous and living in a dream world.  His ex cheated on him and left him, she knows that but I think she is bringing up the ex to distract that she is jealous.  It's clear she didn't have the same type of wedding, she isnt paying for it so why does she care so much?

Based on what you're doing for your wedding I'm assuming you're hindu? Or at least Indian. Is it possible that the jabs from the SIL have racial undertones to them? Because some of her comments to you give me those vibes.", "NTA, but why are you sharing or discussing the plans anywhere around her?  I would just not talk about any of it in front if her.  Why give her ammunition?", "NTA\n\nNot only is it incredibly rude of the sister to be that vocal about someone else's wedding, she is disparaging your culture.\n\nIt seems as though you are having what is a typical Indian wedding. Are you marrying someone who isn't Indian? I mean if the sister is Indian she has to be familiar with this as not outside the norm and if she isn't Indian she should educate herself at least minimally on the customs of her SIL.\n\nI have never been to an Indian wedding - would love to go - but I am aware of what they are including the multiple gatherings for different purposes over the course of a few days. No different in terms of knowing about jumping the broom or smashing the glass", "Why are \"YOU\" fighting these battles?  Your fianc\u00e9 and his parents should have already addressed the sister and, if necessary, told her not to come.  This should have NEVER come from you.  This is a very good lesson to learn but when it comes to problems with your fianc\u00e9/husband's family, let him address them.  If you take on that role, you will always be the bad guy and they will never see your side of things.", "Only let her come if she apologises properly, and tell her if she says one thing now or in the future negative about the wedding you will go NC with her. \n\nShe might actually pull her head in, now that consequences have been shown. This would be better for your in-laws.", "NTA but you realize this is because A is racist, right? i feel like it's not so much a stab in the dark that you're South Asian and that your fiance's family is not considering the differences in ceremony A is complaining about and that you've explained.\n\nyour husband-to-be nailed it on the head: she's bigoted against you and taking out her small-minded prejudices on you for intruding on her perfect white family. /s", "NTA. your peace and I\u2019ll let your husband deal with his family because trying to get involved it\u2019s only going to cause more pain for you.", "NTA \n\nAssumed Indian not sure if racist from me \n\nBut also what is her fucking problem \n\nIf you've got the money then you do you \n\nUnless it's coming all from his parents then ehhh harder to define", "I married a Rockstar at a Zoo in front of pink flamingos. He played there after and we didn\u2019t cater, everyone could order from the menu and pay it themselves. My husband had 15 min of fame and he is cheap. We aren\u2019t poor. But they paid us to get married there. Lol \ud83d\ude02. You have your wedding your way and it is the Holidays, sounds like blast to me. Truly a reason to celebrate two families becoming one. Today is my 6th anniversary. You sister in law sounds like a narcissist. I would discuss this with the family if she does come, she needs to apologize to both of you. And have a bouncer there ready to eject her if she attempts to make it about her. Congratulations and Happy Holidays.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You and your fiance can decide to celebrate however you please. Don't pay her any mind. \n\nI feel bad for her husband because now he has to pick his wife or his friend. \n\nCongrats on the wedding!!", "NTA - tell her not to let the door hit her in the butt on the way out.", "Absolutely NTA. I\u2019d ask A why she cares so much??? See what her response is! I\u2019m assuming it because she likes the ex better than you and is doing anything she can to put a damper on your big day/week. Hopefully she does stay the f**k home and can be miserable by herself. Congratulations btw!!", "NTA.  Why are you even asking?  Soon to be SIL is so off base and wrong here that it's really clear who the AH is here - and it sure isn't OP.\n\nAlso, it doesn't sound like you kicked her out - but rather told her if she didn't like your wedding plans, then she doesn't have to come.\n\nI've never been to a wedding like OP is describing but it sounds fasinating.\n\nCongrats and enjoy your wedding.  Hopefully, soon to be SIL will keep her word and actually stay away.", "YTA for highjacking a holiday for your wedding.", "NTA. Your fianc\u00e9's sister is behaving cruelly to you both and deserves what she gets.", "I mean whatever\n\nI'd just let them deal with her, she's an embarrassment to them\n\nThe gracious thing is to tell them you will accept whatever decision that they make (your fiance and his family in general), as you will be too busy celebrating to even notice such a jealous hateful presence anyhow.", "Is there even a conflict here? You didn't kick her out. She said she wouldn't participate.", "Agree with this 100%!\n\nEnjoy your wedding, to hell with any critics, and have the most amazing time - good luck! \u2764\ufe0f", "She's home for Christmas. My fiance and I are getting married in 2 days. Of course we have to start discussing it. We can't really ask her to leave room every time. And I foolishly thought she'll take part in some of my pre wedding rituals as a SIL.", "I mean I agree but also sounds like the inlaws and fiance have been trying to stop her being rude and she's just not listening. \n\nProbably OP snapped finally, it didn't sound like this was a planned un-inviting.", "Your wedding sounds wonderful!  Do what you and your STBH want. If she\u2019s too jealous or prejudiced to appreciate your wishes, trash can take itself out!\n\nI hope the friend stands up for your DH-to-be, you\u2019re NTA here.", "Congratulations on your wedding Op.  I hope it goes exactly the way you want it to.  You appear to be a caring person to your new family.  If it were me, and I know this will be difficult, but I would have a one on one with A.  Be direct and ask her exactly what her problem is with you.  Wedding to much and extravagant?  She\u2019s not paying for it, why worry.  People going without heat?  How much has she donated to help them?  Your wedding is employing people so that they can support themselves and their families.  You broke up the marriage?  Ex, who you get along with, left your fianc\u00e9.  Not the other way around.  I think when all is said and done, she\u2019s jealous.   Jealous of you, the wedding, her brother\u2019s happiness.  My point is, you\u2019re not challenging her.  You\u2019re asking her to be specific about your relationship with her brother.  Hopefully when confronted with the facts she\u2019ll come to her senses and apologize to you and her brother.  May you and your fianc\u00e9 have a wonderful life together.", "NTA. I went through something similar when my husband and I started planning our wedding i  2018. His older sister was complaining about what we were doing behind our backs. My MIL and other SILs all shut her down and told her to either back of the wedding party or shut up and let us plan the wedding we want. She eventually backed out and then regretted it. Her sisters all told her to just be quiet and not to ruin our day.", "You're not putting your ILs in this position, their daughter is, which they seem to be well aware of considering they've been trying to get her to act right this whole time. Pocket watching is so tacky, and holding a grudge against your future SIL because you like your brother's ex is soooo cringe. NTA. You gave her so many chances. Sorry this has happened so close to the wedding and I hope it's an amazing time regardless.", "NTA I wouldn't back down and re-invite her for any reason.", "NTA. The situation has finally been answered. The first time she stepped out of line it should have been clarified to her that her words were unacceptable and her being put on the spot and asked whether or not she wanted to attend the wedding. Since she clearly indicated she didn't support your match, her invitation should have been rescinded. It's finally been done, feel no guilt cuz it needed to happen", "I like the horseback entrance.", "NTA. She spoiled the opportunity to be a part of a cultural experience she may never get again. Her close-minded bitterness and probably jealously did this, not you. She needs to feel the consequences of her words. You need to focus on your wedding and have a great time! Best wishes!", "Is this an Indian wedding? It sure sounds like it, with the multiple days of celebrating, choreographed dancing, and groom on horseback. If so, all I can say is that your FSIL is going to be missing a FABULOUS experience just because she isn't familiar with your culture. And if she thinks YOUR dress is overdone - wait till she sees what guests who are also from your culture wear. I've been fortunate enough to attend an Indian wedding and had never in my life seen so many stunning outfits. Best wishes to you and your soon-to-be husband - enjoy your wedding without having to deal with your judgmental, narrow-minded FSIL.", "People don't have to come if they have alternate plans. However, it seems that OP was able to create a huge blowout party for everyone to enjoy."]}
