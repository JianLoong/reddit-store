Only you can decide.", "This depends.  I have Huge anxiety if I do any \"survival job\" outside of my field unless it is freelance.  The pandemic had caused my career And freelance gigs to disappear.  I Had to do a steady \"day job\" for a year to literally survive.  Now, in 2 weeks, the \"day job\" goes down to once a week and will  be gone completely in 2-6 weeks!  My career is getting back on track as are the freelance gigs.  If you have other people to pay for your existence and that doesn't bother you, go for it; but remember, they kinda own you then.  Not sure it's an AH thing though.", "Are you able to support yourself without working? Is your fianc\u00e9 willing to support yourself financially? Is your housing situation stable? If so, then NTA", "It's a chronic, usually mild respiratory condition but the variety I have is blood related and heavily sensitive to immune and hormone changes on top of environmental triggers. My menstrual cycle, a sinus infection, or a panic attack can all cause periods of hypoxia.", "My fiance is supporting my financially--all my expenses are less than $600 a month--but living with family is causing my mental health to deteriorate faster than it was before and is causing me issues in trying to get better. It just feels like unless I go back to working a job and just accepting the cycle to continue and allowing myself to get sick again and end up hospitalized ill just be a problem here.", "In my case an online store for handmade clothing items and a content creation channel.", "That is how you end up trapped in the cycle.

Your handmade clothing might sell, but you are limited to the amount that you can make.  I don't know what a \"content creation\" channel is, but that sounds a bit MLM-like, which, if so, is not a career, it's a scam.", "Things like YouTube and Twtich are content creation.
