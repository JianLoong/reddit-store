But\u2026 if he broke the ball you should pay for it.", "YTA, not necessarily for the dog interrupting the game itself, but because you just let the leash go. If another dog was their and the two got into a fight, your dog or one the kids could have been hurt. That's extremely irresponsible.", "YTA. So what happens if your dogs roams over to another dog that isn\u2019t friendly and gets attacked? People often think because their dog is well behaved that the dog is free to roam wherever it wants to. Someone else may have their dog on a leash because it\u2019s not friendly and the leash will keep it from running up to other animals and attacking them. Thankfully your dog just played and no one was harmed.", "YTA.  My dog was in my house, so no leash, chasing a kid with a ball, and accidentally nipped him.  The parents could have asked to put him down and there would be nothing we could have done about it.  Thankfully they didn't, but please think about your dog next time.", "YTA\n\nIt's your responsibility to teach your dog and ensure the safety of those around your dog.

You are lucky no one got hurt", "YTA keep control of your animal, you could have handed the leash to your dad. Had anything gone wrong while tour dog was out of control it could have resulted in being put down. That dog relies on you to keep it safe and you let it down.", "YTA there are many ways to hold onto the leash while tying your shoelace (said from experience as I also have a large boisterous 2yr dog) Also, if you knew your dog \u2018loves to chase things\u2019 and is unable to follow basic commands (stay, leave/drop, and come are all good ones in this situation) you should have walked him elsewhere or at another time", "YTA and you know it. Is isn't that hard to keep track of a dog on a leash you're just lazy.", "YTA for letting your dog loose in general accidents happen but like come on", "When I was a kid, like 1st or 2nd grade, a boy in my class played soccer (I wasn\u2019t at the game). His dad was a doctor.  A man on the other side of the field had a heart attack. The Dr ran across the field to try to save him. Our team was penalized.  That was too far. This was not.

You are lucky he did something cute and not something terrible.", "YTA so you have so little respect for other people your reasoning as to why you ruined his game is because you got to laugh at young kids. that is so incredibly self-centered, you and your dog sound like an obnoxious nightmare", "YTA. I feel bad for the dog. It always sucks to have an irresponsible owner.", "YTA\n\nLook, I know it was a cute moment but these kids are 8, not 3. No one knows or trusts your dog and those families made the time and effort to get to that game.", "Damn everyone here is being over dramatic. Ya YTA, but like, come on! It\u2019s funny, no one got hurt, everyone seems to have been ok with it. Just don\u2019t let it happen again, probably. \n\nEven the most well behaved dogs will have a moment of weakness and chase something", "Unfortunately if you don\u2019t teach your dog NIT to do this eventually it will get injured.

You\u2019ll need to teach him how to flop first.", "NTA but if you often drop his leash you need to train him to stay and not run.

It looks like I am in the minority.", "that's a bad mistake but doing nothing to fix his error makes him a far bigger AH", "even if not biting a kid the dog clearly likes to chase and could have really scared one of the kids.", "Then you loop the leash around your wrist. It's not that hard to not be a terrible dog owner, but ya'll sure have a way of making it look difficult.", "WTF?? What if one of those kids on the field were scared of a dog running around? People who don't bother to control their dogs in public places are lazy entitled aholes. Hands down. I don't care the reason.", "At 16 if you can\u2019t work out how to tie your shoe and hold onto a dog you have far bigger problems in life.

If you need to be hands-free for a moment to do something with your hands, you stand on the leash. You don\u2019t just drop it and let your dog interrupt a soccer game, even if it is a group of 6-8 year old kids. If you\u2019re going to own a dog, you need to understand it is your responsibility to keep it under control in all circumstances. \n\nAs if causing a major public disruption wasn\u2019t bad enough, cutting your dog loose like that could have resulted in it getting in a fight with another dog in the park or harming one of the children. You were massively disrespectful of all the players, refs, coaches, and spectators time by creating such a disturbance in the first place, and you were just an outright bad pet parent to not stop it as soon as it started. Entitled AH\u2019s like you are the reason animals get banned from outdoor events like that, and it\u2019s not fair for you to ruin that for everyone else because you\u2019re to lazy to be bothered to train your dog properly.

For so many reasons.", "You could have handed the leash to your dad if he was close to you, asked a stranger if they could hold for it, tie the leash to your wrist/pole or maybe tie it around your leg.\n\nAnything but letting it go because that sounds like a dog attack waiting to happen with a side of lawsuit. \n\nIf your dog is friendly and likes to go up to strangers, no one but you, your family, and friends know that, but not the people your dog\u2019s running to.

It was a fucking mistake", "You shouldn't only be holding the leash in your hand in the first place; you should always have your wrist through the loop and grasp the leash past that.

So, to tie your shoes, you can let go of the leash and have your hand free because the loop/handle of the leash is still around your wrist.", "A mistake that could have cost the dog it's life if it ended up startled and bit a kid all because she couldn't manage to be responsible. If you can't walk a dog and tie your shoes at he same time, you shouldn't own a dog.", "This is the way.", "My dad always taught me and my siblings not to put the loop of the leash on our wrists in case the dog unexpectedly takes off after something, so we didn\u2019t get pulled over or dragged behind.", "That sounds like a good way to hurt your wrist", "Try harder.", "I think that's something taught to children, when they're small enough to get pulled over or dragged. It depends on the type of dog, I suppose, but most 16-year-olds will not get pulled over by, or dragged behind, a dog.", "A kid that's too small to hold on to the leash if a dog runs should NOT be the one responsible for holding the leash.", "I was maybe five or six, and my brother and I were walking our Aunt and Uncle's two smallish dogs. Shoelace came untied. Didn't have anywhere else to tie the leash and my brother was refusing to hold it because he told me to tie my shoes better earlier so he was irritated. I made the poor choice to *keep standing* to tie the shoe.\n\nGeorge was a good dog but he saw a cat and *lunged*. I ended up with my breath knocked out of me as I fell on the curb. Twisted ankle. Decent amount of scrapes. Dirty as Hell from the gutter.\n\nDefinitely hurt but what was worse was the embarrassment. If I just did one or two things differently, I wouldn't have had to hobble home and explain why I looked like I picked a fight with an oncoming train."]}
