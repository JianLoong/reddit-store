Dogs (especially younger ones) tend to jump, scratch and bite at people when they're excited, which could harm or frighten the children (and not to mention damage the equipment). It's also a huge interruption to the flow of the game, and in most places it's against the bylaws to have dogs in park/field spaces. You also have to consider the safety of your dog. There was a post on here not too long ago about a dog being injured after someone accidentally kicked a soccer ball at it. Your dog could be hit with a ball, kicked, ran over, etc. You don't seem to care about that possibility. Finally, your dog sounds poorly trained -- it's obvious they have no recall ability and you don't care to teach your dog manners. It's people like you who are SO shocked when their dog bites someone and needs to be put down.", "Step on leash. Tie shoe. Pick up leash. YTA", "Of course.
