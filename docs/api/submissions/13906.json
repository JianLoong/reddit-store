She is so easily influenced its embarrassing. Now because of tiktok she has a 5 step skincare routine, god only knows how much money she threw away on snake oil products. She spends hours following make up routines she sees on there. She now wakes up at 5am to do a workout plan from an account she follows. She is constantly cooking recipes from TikTok, going to restaurant she found on there. Everything is from Tiktok I don't think she has ever had a original thought in her life. She is 35 for God's sake, it's an app for teenagers!\n\nNow with easter coming up she is asking to bring some butter board she saw on tiktok. It honestly sounded ridiculous. I finally decided to say something to her. I explained to her how its embarrassing how she is still trying to act like a teenager, no amount of skincare and 5AM workouts will stop her from aging. She is 35 she is going to have wrinkles, we all went though it now its her turn, she is just wasting money and its time to grow up and accept how old she is, she is no longer a teenager and that's ok, we all age. I explained to her that her life is flying by she is married with no children. She is 35 I fear she is going to wake up in a few years and regret not having children and wasting so much of her time worried about what she looks like.  \n\nShe told me forget it  she won't even come to easter. She told me \"Just because I gave up on myself doesn't mean she need too.\" Which was incredibly rude and unnecessary sorry I have two kids to take care of I don't have time to worry about wrinkles or if my outfit is perfect. She then hung up.\n\nNow my in-laws are pissed and they have decided to do easter at their house since SIL now feel too uncomfortable coming to our house. And of course she will be making her ridiculous butter board. My husband agrees that she needs to grow up but thinks I should have kept my mouth shut and should apologize so we can have a nice easter. But I'm looking out for her she is no longer a teenager and it's time to accept that.", "created_utc": 1680535717, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12anv0y/aita_for_telling_my_sil_to_grow_and_stop_coping/", "score": 412, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Can you hear yourself? You're mad at someone for *working out*. \n\n> I explained to her that her life is flying by she is married with no children. She is 35 I fear she is going to wake up in a few years and regret not having children and wasting so much of her time worried about what she looks like.\n\nThis quote gives me the impression that you do have kids and have probably let yourself go. In order to cope with this, or create an excuse for yourself, you dig your heels into some antiquated and narrow-minded perspective like \"only people who reproduce are truly grown up.\" Or \"I can't work out because I'm too busy taking care of me kids, something my childless SIL can't understand.\" despite many great parents still finding time to take care of themselves. \n\nI don't use TikTok and am entirely unaware of its landscape. But I was expecting you to be talking about your SIL constantly pulling pranks or holding up foot traffic to do some sort of dance. Not *working out and trying new recipes.*\n\nYeah, I'll say it again, YTA. I think you're the one who needs to grow up. You chose to have kids so stop being jealous and judgemental of someone who decided not to and is living their best life.", "YTA,\n\nTiktok is not only for teenagers.\n\n>**She is 35 I fear she is going to wake up in a few years and regret not having children** and wasting so much of her time worried about what she looks like.\n\nSuprise women can be happy an have fulfilling lives without kids.

I would like to be friends with SIL, she sounds like fun.", "Calm down, Regina George.", "YTA. \n\nWhy are you so concerned about her life. And honestly none of what she did was obnoxious or embarrassing. Waking up at 5am and working out? That's taking good care of her body. Having a 5 step skin care routine, that's good! And trying out new stuff? That's great! You have not listed one thing that she did that was embarrassing. You on the other hand...", "YTA. You sound really bitter and jealous.", "Yeah YTA how is her doing any of those things impacting YOUR life.\n\nYou sound bitter and jealous.", "So your SIL is using a very popular social media app (largely used by adults by the way, but way to be confident with how out of touch you are) to find ideas to better herself, and you make fun of her for it? She\u2019s just finding fun things to try. \n\nYTA and you need to grow up. Your SIL is just existing, and you have an irrational hatred for TikTok. Do you even know what it is? Or have you just seen Facebook posts complaining about it and you think you\u2019re superior because you don\u2019t get involved in it? How is it any different than hearing about a recipe or product from a friend? Or seeing an ad and thinking \u201chm maybe that\u2019s good.\u201d \n\nYou\u2019re 42 and judging a woman for getting ideas for things off social media. That\u2019s more embarrassing than anything you described her doing.", "YTA - She has time for self care and hobbies. How she chooses to pursue happiness has nothing to do with you unless she is hurting you - which it doesn\u2019t seem like she is. \n\nI\u2019m interested in this butter board. Does she infuse butter with different flavors for you to try? does she make her own bread? Please share her recipe, if so!", "YTA\n\nWhy do you care about a butter board?  Why was this a bridge too far?  Why was this the nuclear event?\n\n\" she is just wasting money and its time to grow up \"\n\nIt's her money to waste, and none of your business.  You're the one that needs to grow up and learn to keep your nose where it belongs.\n\nGood  luck!", "YTA in so many ways. You hate that she is being productive and doing good, healthy things because it came from Tiktok. Which, to you, is somehow an age restricted platform?

As in, the thing that every doctor and medical professional would be happy she is doing?\n\nYou think a single woman in her mid-30s shouldn't be taking care of her skin? You say, \"I have two kids to take care of I don't have time to worry about wrinkles or if my outfit is perfect,\" but if she has the time why do you think she needs to be like you?\n\nShe hears about restaurants and goes to them, like everyone who has ever read a restaurant review from a newspaper, but it's bad because it came from a different source?\n\nShe's found a source for recipes she likes, and that's somehow bad?\n\nYou sound like an angry, bitter, jealous person. Leave her alone. I'm glad your family is shunning you, maybe you'll learn something, though it seems obvious you won't.\n\n>But I'm looking out for her she is no longer a teenager and it's time to accept that.\n\nWhat an utter line of BS. You aren't looking out for her, you're trying to dictate that she lives her life like you.", "YTA. What harm is her behavior causing you, or anyone, and what business is it of yours?", "Yeah, you're an AH. So she enjoys the gym and face cream.\n\nWhat would you teach your kids? If you can't say something nice, don't say it at all? Golden rule? I can think of a bunch you could try to emulate.\n\nBeing \"influenced\" is also \"learning new things.\" Sounds like she's having fun.\n\nYTA.\n\nedit: a word", "YTA she isn't doing anything negative. Plenty of 35 year olds go to the gym in the morning, afternoon, or evening. Plenty of 35 year olds have skincare routines. Nothing about that is for teens exclusively.

But I think I have a clue. You're jealous, see here\n\"Sorry I have two kids to take care of I don't have time to worry about wrinkles or if my outfit is perfect\"\n By your admission, you have no time for self-care, for your self etc and that comment about your clothes, telling. It bothers you and now you're lashing out.\n\nYou see a married childless woman having the time of her life and you're pissed. \n\n 'She is 35 I fear she is going to wake up in a few years and regret not having children and wasting so much of her time worried about what she looks like.'\n\n Yeah no. \nYou want her to end up like you, miserable and bitter. But here's the thing OP even if she does have children, there's no guarantee she will end up like you. No guarantee she'll age just like you have, but you can't see that.\n\nMind your business and stop being so jealous", "YTA. 5 step skincare and working out is pretty typical of all women who give a shit, not just 35 year olds wasting time on TikTok. You sound insufferable with your judgment and resignation that you won't care for yourself. You gave up on yourself so she shouldn't care about herself either?\n\nTrying new recipes is too trendy for you? Is mayonnaise too spicy for you too? Boo-hoo, she went to dinner at a restaurant, how will she ever marry and have children if she doesn't... hide at home? How does she meet people if she's not out and about being more interesting than a bunion? And what if, holy shit, she doesn't want your life?! You should skip Easter and try being more Christ-like. Maybe try a new recipe and add some SPF to your skin care while you try not to be so salty.", "YTA. \n\nJealous much at how much better she looks and how much more fun her life is?", "You sound like a nightmare I\u2019m gonna be honest", "YTA. Let the woman live her life. \n\nBtw, I have a kid and a 5 step skin routine, and I go to the gym almost every morning - how is that even possible???", "YTA. \n\nShe didn't ask for your opinion on her life choices, pastimes, or where she gets recommendations for products or lifestyle. So you should've collected all of those, roll them all up, and shove them up yours. \n\nAlso, you sound incredibly bitter and jealous. Who the hell are you to decide how a 35 year old woman has to act? Who the hell are you to decide whether her skin care routine is a waste of time and money or not? Is she asking you for money? Is she taking up your time? No? Then SHUT UP. \n\nYour comments about her being child free and you \"not having time\" to look after yourself gave you away. You are just bitter and want to force her to have children and stop having time to do her make up just like you. \n\nAnd by the way, I have a family and I run a business, and my skincare routine has 8 steps. I'm in my mid-30s and strangers constantly assume I'm a few years younger. So don't blame your kids for your wrinkles or your lack of time. That's your choice, and it's as respectable as your SIL's. \n\nLeave her alone.", "YTA.\n\nHow much time she spends on Tiktok and what she does for her skincare routine is none of your business. She's happy doing what she does, so leave alone. Worrying about your looks doesn't stop you from having children, so she probably has her own reasons if she still doesn't have any, maybe she just doesn't want them. Still, you shouldn't tell her what to do, you were condescending and rude.", "Ask yourself this: how does her doing these things, these trends, affect you in any way?  So long as she is not actively harming herself or others, putting anyone in danger (some TikTok trends can be quite dangerous), or asking you or her brother to bail her out of a mess of her own doing then what she does does not affect you in any way.\n\nYTA\n\nYou are completely free to tell her that you are not very interested in hearing about TikTok trends, but everything else you said sounds like you are bitter and / or have this high-minded attitude some parents have that because they procreated their time is far more valuable because they have children and have no time for things they consider frivolous.", "YTA.

Nothing that you've listed is immature. A person taking care of herself is great. Maybe you should watch some TikTok videos on being a better person.", "YTA\n\nPlease get a hobby other than judging your SIL.\n\nNobody \"forgets\" to have kids. If you're happy with your life, what does it matter if she has different priorities?", "YTA.  Shame on you for trying to throw shade at her for doing what makes her happy.", "YTA. Her behavior might be ridiculous but it\u2019s also completely harmless. I wouldn\u2019t want to spend time with you either.", "Woah, buddy! YTA. And I think you know that. It sounds like SIL enjoys her child free life and is quite active. She clearly enjoys self care, exercise, and cooking new foods. It doesn't sound like she offered a lot of thoughts about your life until you offered some pretty harsh, unsolicited criticisms of hers. Also, you're on Reddit right now so I'm not sure we get to cringe at people who like TikTok. \n\nThe bottom line is, it's not your job to enforce social rules about when people ought to have children and it's none of your business why she doesn't. Maybe she doesn't want any or maybe she desperately wants them and can't have them. The content she's in to sounds like content produced by people in her general age range. She's not trying to be a teenager, she's just taking care of herself. A less charitable observer than me might think you sounded jealous of the time and attention she is free to give her own body and appearance. \n\nYou might enjoy TikTok, by the way. Lots of patents on there.", "YTA\n\nSomething I've learned is that there is no \"growing up.\" If she is still doing everything else right to support herself, her home, and whatever family/pets she has, what is the issue? I can see how it can be annoying to you how often she brings these things into other people's lives, but she's happy. Next time, tell her not to be so in-your-face about it instead of telling her she's acting like a child. You 100% could have handled this better.", "YTA man, let people enjoy things.

My Mom constantly called her a moron, but it didn\u2019t affect my life so I just let it be. Eventually my sister arrived to the conclusion that it *might* be a bad idea on her own- guess who she reached out to for advice? Not the people who were insulting her for doing it in the first place. \n\nIn other words- even if you personally believe she\u2019s wasting her money, it\u2019s none of your business and you\u2019ll drive her further away if she ever decides to potentially reconsider.", "YTA - You really just come off bitter.", "The only thing I agree with you on is that butter boards are effing stupid.

She is so easily influenced its embarrassing. Now because of tiktok she has a 5 step skincare routine, god only knows how much money she threw away on snake oil products. She spends hours following make up routines she sees on there. She now wakes up at 5am to do a workout plan from an account she follows. She is constantly cooking recipes from TikTok, going to restaurant she found on there. Everything is from Tiktok I don't think she has ever had a original thought in her life. She is 35 for God's sake, it's an app for teenagers!\n\nNow with easter coming up she is asking to bring some butter board she saw on tiktok. It honestly sounded ridiculous. I finally decided to say something to her. I explained to her how its embarrassing how she is still trying to act like a teenager, no amount of skincare and 5AM workouts will stop her from aging. She is 35 she is going to have wrinkles, we all went though it now its her turn, she is just wasting money and its time to grow up and accept how old she is, she is no longer a teenager and that's ok, we all age. I explained to her that her life is flying by she is married with no children. She is 35 I fear she is going to wake up in a few years and regret not having children and wasting so much of her time worried about what she looks like.  \n\nShe told me forget it  she won't even come to easter. She told me \"Just because I gave up on myself doesn't mean she need too.\" Which was incredibly rude and unnecessary sorry I have two kids to take care of I don't have time to worry about wrinkles or if my outfit is perfect. She then hung up.\n\nNow my in-laws are pissed and they have decided to do easter at their house since SIL now feel too uncomfortable coming to our house. And of course she will be making her ridiculous butter board. My husband agrees that she needs to grow up but thinks I should have kept my mouth shut and should apologize so we can have a nice easter. But I'm looking out for her she is no longer a teenager and it's time to accept that.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Her choices arent hurting you or anyone else.  What business of yours is her skincare routine, or when she chooses to workout?  And when were you given the right to decide what she does with her womb?  And after you have criticised all her life choices and she snaps back at you, you find it incredibly rude and unnecessary!\n\nYour husband is right, you should keep your mouth shut and your nose out of others business.", "YTA YOU need to grow up and get over yourself. So your SIL likes to get ideas from TikTok. Who cares? It is NONE of your business. If she got the idea from a cooking magazine would you suddenly value it more because it's \"grown up\"?", "YTA. Sounds like she has a lot of time to focus on self-care and you're jealous that you don't have the same time/motivation for it.\n\nAlso I had never heard of a butter board so I looked it up. Looks like a super nice charcuterie-style board for dipping. So basically she wanted to try to make something new and nice for Easter and you started berating her about her life because of it. \n\nStop being so judgmental.", "LMAO!! You\u2019re the jealous AH (YTA)", "YTA. Sprinkle some of that salt on your own butter board.", "YTA! Is her skincare or workout routine harming you somehow?

Trying new food and new makeup techniques does NOT make her a teenager or childish. Also, not everyone is looking for a ring and babies. Lastly, it's absolutely NONE if your business what she chooses to spend her money on as long as she isn't begging you to help pay her bills. You need to get over the fact that she is NOT you.

It sounds good.", "YTA and it sounds like you\u2019ve been drinking haterade. Work on that.", "YTA, sounds like someone is bitter in their life path and is taking it out on others.

Even if you had a point about TikTok (which I don\u2019t believe you do) you went way, way overboard with your lecture. It is likely because she is well aware she is no longer a teenager that she is putting time and effort into looking after herself. And what\u2019s it to you if she is? You have upset your in-law\u2019s Easter, not your SIL. It\u2019s up to you to make this right.", "YTA \n\nwhat she does is not your business and has literally no impact on your life beside having to look at a butter board (you might have liked it)\n\nthink about your own life. work on your life. let other people live how they want", "YTA - Omg, she has a skin care routine, is exercising and trying new recipes and restaurants!

I\u2019m a mother too, and a know that not everyone wants or needs to take the same path. Also it says a lot more about you than her that you\u2019re judging basic self care as being ridiculous.

Lots of my colleagues have Tiktok and while I don't have the app, I honestly enjoy the videos they send me. We're not teenagers either  \n\n\n2) There is nothing wrong in taking care for yourself. She can have as many beauty routines as she wants. In fact, I suggest you try one, as your post reeks of jealousy.   \n\n\n3) How much money she is spending and on what is none of your business, it's her money, unless you are financially supporting her  \n\n\n4) Also it's none of your business whether she will have marriage and kids or not  \n\n\n5) Your entire attitude about \"we all get old, it's your turn\". Of course, we all age. That doesn't mean stop taking care of ourselves. \"Sorry I have kids to take care of\" my ass.

Who cares if she wants to try new foods and get exercise?", "I\u2019m 36 and I think mine is 8 steps? My skin feels and looks healthier than it did in my 20s. Not younger, obviously, but that\u2019s not really my goal. I simply look and feel very nice.", "OP was rude first and sil had to tell op about herself", "OP says \" god only knows how much money she threw away on snake oil products\" but she doesn't list a single scam or bullshit product that SIL bought.  SIL takes care of her skin, gets makeup tips, makes recipes, goes out to restaurants and wants to bring a butter board to Easter (which is harmless and also probably pretty delicious).  I think that OP is just jealous that SIL is living her best life.  Does she think most people DON'T get skincare information, restaurant reviews, or recipes from the internet?  For some reason, TikTok is the specific problem? OP definitely YTA.", ">Personally I think the lady sounds annoying\n\nHow? I'm actually curious.\n\nOP is pointing out that the lady works out, tries new restaurants and enjoys doing her make up/getting dolled up. AND this is all coming from the perspective of OP who is clearly jealous and spiteful. These are the worst qualities she could point out? Those all sound normal and fun things to do. I love trying recipes I see on tiktok and online in general, and have found some of the best restuarant food I've had on TikTok/FB/Insta", "Out of all the tiktok food trends, I do think butter boards are odd but I wouldn\u2019t ever talk shit about someone who made one.", "I mean nothing SIL does sounds weird. I've had a 5-step skincare routine since before tik tok. Heck I don't even have tik tok, but I've gotten parts of work outs off insta before and I'm older than op with a couple of kids.", "That\u2019s sounds delicious.", "Butter Boards are so fetch!", "Eh, I dislike TikTok and YT shorts for their vertical format and short length.", "My cousin did a butter board for a recent party and holy crap it was amazing.", "Tbh I\u2019ve never heard of a butter board but after looking it up it looks good. Sounds more appealing than having a bunch of bread with no butter or a bunch of bread the host had to handle to spread butter on it. And it looks like it has more options for flavours and stuff. As the host it looks like it would be a lot quicker to make than individually buttering and spicing bread and easier to replenish.\n\nI\u2019m curious if it\u2019s one of those things that sound good but don\u2019t work very well in practice (ie., after the first couple people you mainly just have a greasy board) but it looks like it would be neat to try. Honestly finding new ideas is one of the great things about the internet.", "Omg skincare from Menards", "Okay but it doesn't make you angry, and that's true of most social media tbh, FB reels and insta stories and stuff, they're all short. So my points stand lol.", "I\u2019m 44 and I collect Star Wars Pop figurines and love Animal Crossing\u2026", "I'm right there with you along with my Beanie Babies! (there's still a chance they will make me millions!! MILLIONS I tell you!!)", "Oh OP would definitely cuss me out for my plushie collection alone. Maybe add in some extra curses over my giant bags of art supplies or my autograph collection.\n\nEdit: 30, works in an office, pays taxes and bills - I can do whatever I want with the leftover cash. Right now I\u2019m in bed with a Ghostface plush and a couple of my commissioned ones and sketching. Op needs to stay in her lane.", "I'm 45 with a doctorate, a full-time job, a kid, and a mortgage.\n\nI also play D&D twice a week, watch cartoons, and build BRIO train tracks. \n\nFuck the entire concept of \"age-appropriate\" hobbies.", "In this case, wanting to say something does make OP the asshole, because she wanted to tell her SIL that she shouldn't take suggestions from TikTok, that she is wasting her time not being a mother, that wrinkles are a fact and she shouldn't bother with her skin care routine, and that she works out too much. There is nothing in the post that truly shows \"snake oil\" issues. \n\nSo wanting to comment about SIL life and choices makes her an asshole because not only is it not OPs business how the SIL chooses to live her life, but her primary problem seems to be that SIL is taking care of herself and focusing on herself, when OP is focusing on her children.\n\nI'm trying to find a rational point that OP has any business making to SIL in the post, and can't find any.", "They are amazing.  My friend made one with breads and pretzels.  Added honey and spices to some of the butters. It was great!", "Exactly, what's the big deal about having a butter board,  sounds yummy.", "Butter boards are awesome and the concept has been around for a few years now but has gained traction on TikTok", "You need to try it. My stepmom made one for Christmas dinner. She makes some of the best food I've ever eaten, but we were all surrounded around that butter board like vultures! We were just like, \"so, we're eating butter.... and can't stop\"", "You\u2019re too old for TikTok! Stay here on reddit which has just very mature people at all times! /s", "Exactly. I'm only in my 30s, and I'm already encountering friends who are all \"eww, I don't want to listen to that new rock band, just put on some Fall Out Boy\" and \"I'm too old to wear wide-legged pants.\" \n\nAnd I don't really get it at all. Like yeah, there's silly things that only teens will like, but that doesn't meant that literally every new thing has to be viewed with suspicion and disdain. Who wants to live their entire life rigidly following the trends that just happened to be popular when they were 15 to 25 years old?", "Lol Fall Out Boy is old now?! I hesitate to tell you that my friends tell me to put on Guns N Roses \ud83d\ude02", "I'm 63 and don't know what Squishmellows are, but I enjoy my TikTok. Let her live her best life.", "Me too, specifically dragons!", "Oh trust me, I don't view them as being ancient, classic rock or something. Personally, I feel like being in my 30s is still young and the bands we liked 15 years ago are still relatively modern. \n\nWhich is part of why it's so surprising to notice some of my peers already developing that \"I'm too old to care about anything new\" attitude.", "Justice for Miami Girl!", "41 and people will have to pry my funko pops from my dead hands.", "Oh my gosh. You gotta get yourself some Squishmallows.", "justice for all the girls. i have not forgotten about laura leigh and jax breaking up with her after the AA meeting", "Y'all, I'm taking notes. Maybe if I used TikTok my skin wouldn't look like aging alcoholism and over-baked modeling clay.", "Also I have several squishamallows and a huge Winnie the Pooh that sits on a box near my door", "Well, I'm obviously not watching enough. \n\nAlthough I've saved plenty of recipes, I've yet to muster up the willpower to bake or cook them.\n\nSame goes for all the exercise videos or gadgets..\n\nI just cannae be bothered."]}
