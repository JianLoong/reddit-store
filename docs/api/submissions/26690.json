Come to find out, he broke up with her because his best friend told him he would be better off dating a girl that\u2019s older than him. So he sent his ex a message saying, \u201cWe have to be friends because my mom is making me focus on school.\u201d Then sent a text to his new girlfriend the same day  saying he was single and ready to date her. He\u2019s also talking to multiple girls on Snapchat and playing with their feelings. So I made him call his original girlfriend and confess he lied and was talking to other girls all this time and it wasn\u2019t his moms decision for them to break up. I just felt she needed to know the type of person he really is instead of thinking she missed out on what could have been.", "created_utc": 1694475601, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16gbdkp/aita_for_making_my_16yearold_son_tell_his_ex_he/", "score": 111, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You've got a bigger problem on your hands though --kid lacks character, and while that's NOT totally your fault, it's partially your responsibility. You got two-ish years to think about what kind of adult human you're releasing into the wild!", "NTA - Go mom! He'll learn from this to not be a shitty human being moving forward. Life delivers tough lessons and go you for helping him out.", "On the fence with this, I don\u2019t think you\u2019re bad in any way but as a parent this is a weird place for you to step into if I\u2019m being honest, like I don\u2019t know how you have so much information about his relationships and whether you spied or something but if he willingly used to share these things with you and this was your reaction then he might never want to open up to you again. Also he didn\u2019t cheat? He left one person and went for another that\u2019s as normal as things get no matter how old you are", "NTA. He didn't cheat, so title is misleading. He is an asshole though, so good on you for exposing his antics.", "Sounds like good parenting. At least that part. Now teach his ass to have respect for girls.", "NTA.", "NTA\n\nI applaud and encourage this! Actions have consequences, and if you act scummy and douchey, you better be ready to deal with the consequences of doing so. \n\nI hope this makes him realize how wrong it is to play with the emotions of others and how horrible lying in a relationship is. This is a great learning moment, I hope he takes something away from this", "I was expecting to say that you screwed up, because one of our jobs as parents (at least while they are minors) is to be their excuse for getting out of things.   But the specifics flipped that around.  I'd like to think I would have done the exact same thing in this situation, kudos to you, NTA.", "NTA. The kid used you for a lie without your consent and knowledge.", "NTA. You're teaching him what's right and wrong in relationships. Maybe he'll learn and maybe he won't but at least you're trying. Especially since he brought you into his lies.", "Yta, that sounds controlling and borderline psychotic, no matter how much the puritan morality is involved in your judgment. You'll have a hard time managing your feelings when he's grown up and not on your hold anymore.", "ESH\n\nI don't think it's really your business. You didn't need to make him humiliate himself by being forced to apologize and become resentful towards you. He's not knocking chicks up yet. Let him make dumb mistakes and learn the hard way (same goes for the ex girlfriend). You can't helicopter him for the rest of his life. If this is his personality, then he will learn one way or another he can't treat women like this because eventually he'll get bitchslapped.", "Damn , I feel bad for the kid , YTA \u2026\nHe\u2019s 16 and they barely dated for 3 / 4 months ? And he didn\u2019t even cheat , he just saw that it wasn\u2019t for him ( for whatever reason ) , ended it , THEN  moved on to the next option..", "Yta, you are an adult and he's 16 if you aren't capable of having a conversation about what's good or bad without forcing him , don't be surprised when he doesn't talk to you anymore he's not a child you shouldn't force him to do stuff he doesn't want to , you need to talk to him, or he won't stop he would just get better at hiding for you , while you are so proud of yourself thinking you changed him", "YTA, this is an unhealthy amount of involvement in your kids love life. Also trying to publicly humiliate your kid and this girl is mean. Saying my mom wants us to break up is way kinder to a 16 year old girl, than the other girl is hotter and has more to offer. That girl 100% feels worse now than with the kind lie your son told.", "YTA - This is NOT your business. \n\nCertainly you should guide him in his relationships and be a source of counsel but, to DEMAND and manipulate him into doing something he doesn't want to do is crossing the line. All you have done is encourage him to never confide in you about future relationship issues.\n\nHe is 16, immature, and will make mistakes. Your responsibility is to let him know when you think he is making a mistake but to give him the freedom and respect to find his own way, not brow beat him into doing what YOU think is right.", "This is exactly how you get him to never tell you anything at all ever again", "Where\u2019s his father?", "YTA. Stay the hell out of your kids love life. Good lord how does this even need to be said.", "YTA, I don\u2019t think what he was doing is considered cheating.

He's 16 and if the lie comes back to bite him in the butt, it comes back. He might get away with it the first time but that's probably going to be the last time. \n\nYTA for trying to police high school drama.", "YTA \n\n\u201cWhy my son doesn\u2019t trust me?\u201d Come on! He can learn by himself, he\u2019s 16!", "YTA. Stay out of your 16yo\u2019s private life.", "YTA. I agree what he did was messed up and I am in no way excusing his behavior, but it's a weird thing to involve yourself in his relationships. Eventually the truth would come out, I say this as someone who had some similar drama in school because I was also an asshole. But instead of it unfolding and your son learning his lesson, he probably resents you for involving yourself. Yes he should have admitted it, but not because you forced him to. And to anyone saying the kid deserved to get outed, he's 16 and no parent should \"out\" their children and cause additional drama. Parents who involve themselves in their children's relationships are overstepping bounds. \n\nThis has nothing to do with you, and you went and involved yourself in your son's breakup anyway.", "YTA\n\nFortunately, your son won't give you another chance to mettle in his life. Next time you wonder why he is so secretive, think of that moment. 16 year olds are still trying to figure everything out and not have their mom breaking children's hearts.", "The kid\u2019s 16, forcing your way into his love life at this age is creepy at best. Step off.", "YTA - This is uncomfortable & I'm not sure why you're getting involved to this extent. How do you even know all of this anyway? I'm guessing he didn't volunteer it. \n\nTalk to him about lying & his treatment of girls sure.. but ultimately he's still a kid & learning. \"I just felt she needed to know what type of person he really is.\" This is CHILLING. You seem to have some very negative feelings towards your own child. You're not a hero in this story.", "NTA the less he gets away with lying the better it is in the long run for him.  And everyone else of course, but mostly him.", "Nice job \ud83d\udc4d \n\nNTA", "NTA. If he has any semblance of decency he should have told her way before any of that happened. That being said I did something similar when I was a teenager and I still think about it and how badly I treated that girl\u2026 it\u2019s a good life lesson to learn, but also, a 16 year old doesn\u2019t want their mom having anything to do with their love life.", "NTA, your job as a parent is to bring well adjusted morally sound adults into this world. Cheating is none of those, so get working.", "NTA.\n\nUse me to get you out of a sticky friend situation. But tell me why you used me.\n\nBut to get out of this? No thanks.", "Everyone is saying NTA but I think you\u2019re YTA because you should really stay out of his personal life. Don\u2019t at like you haven\u2019t used \u201cmy mom\u2026\u201d as an excuse when you were younger. I think it would be better if you talked to him about why it\u2019s wrong and not intervene on his personal life.

I hope he learns a lesson, at least not to use his mom\u2019s name in vain.", "NTA. He is learning the consequences of his actions. But I hope he learns to respect women eventually. He is acting like they are disposable.", "YTA. Mind your business.", "NTA - If it isn't the consequences of his own actions \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f. Good on you tbh. I'd have absolutely done the same and it's best he learns to pick his behaviour up now while he's still young.", "NTA. He needs to straighten up!", "No. You are correct. As a man, I think you have given him a valuable lesson.

Then I asked to see his Snapchat and he showed me the messages he sent to other girls way before he decided to end it with his girlfriend. I thought maybe he needed a little push to let her know the truth is all. But for him to end the relationship on \u201cgood terms\u201d by lying wasn\u2019t cool.

One should not lie to other people but not because they are vulnerable or because they are women but because it's wrong.

In fact it may make him think about how good it can feel owning up to his own mistakes and it shows by example that everyone makes mistakes and its ok to admit and apologize. He may even apologize to his snapchat girls for wasting their time. \n\nSo it could really turn into a win win. He will never want to repeat that phone call AND he could learn that it is ok to own up to ones mistakes. Good luck OP.", "Oh", "Fair enough. Agreed, his behaviour isn't OK.
