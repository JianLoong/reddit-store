I think it is important now for you to have a candid discussion with your family about how you feel about the subject, and that a happy and healthy family relationship from your perspective will require that they respect your life course.

You don't have to stay where people are disrespecting you.", "NTA. The need to respect you and how you want your life to be. If you don't want that then that is OKAY. You have every right to live YOUR life! Boundaries are there for a reason!", "NTA - Apparently the only way your family will listen to you is by your actions.

And somehow their choices are EVERYONE\u2019S fucking business. \n\nYour family has no sense of boundaries. And as you cannot control their behavior, you made the rational, adult decision to remove yourself from the situation. \n\nThere was a point in my life where I had to make it clear with my family that if they didn\u2019t back the fuck up on something, I wouldn\u2019t come home anymore.

It\u2019s likely easy for your brother to talk about how great being a dad is when he doesn\u2019t have to do all of the heavy lifting or use much of his time and energy related to that.

They're the assholes for doing that because their words are intentionally meant to bring you down.

My third son chose college with a double major and a masters. He is not married. My late-in-life daughter has chosen a completely different path. At age 19, she became a single mom by seeking custody of a non-bio child. While it took her forever, she has gotten her education degree and now teaches. \n\nAll of my children are fantastic people.

Your parents should be happy and proud of you  if you are satisfied with your life.", "NTA\n\nYou've said it in a small, quiet voice, and we're ignored.
