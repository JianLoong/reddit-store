I love them very much, though I wish they'd ask me about my day rather than about my dating life!\"", "NTA.\n\nI think your response was proportional to the unrelenting pressure being placed upon you by your family.\n\nIt was important that you stood up for yourself.\n\nYWBTA if you followed through, however, on your undertaking to be \"done with them\". I think it is important now for you to have a candid discussion with your family about how you feel about the subject, and that a happy and healthy family relationship from your perspective will require that they respect your life course.

You don't have to stay where people are disrespecting you.", "NTA. The need to respect you and how you want your life to be. If you don't want that then that is OKAY. You have every right to live YOUR life! Boundaries are there for a reason!", "NTA - Apparently the only way your family will listen to you is by your actions. You have every right to have your view on YOUR life respected.

And somehow their choices are EVERYONE\u2019S fucking business. \n\nYour family has no sense of boundaries. And as you cannot control their behavior, you made the rational, adult decision to remove yourself from the situation. \n\nThere was a point in my life where I had to make it clear with my family that if they didn\u2019t back the fuck up on something, I wouldn\u2019t come home anymore. And the reason why that worked was because i wasn\u2019t bluffing. \n\nYou showed them where the line is. Don\u2019t back down.

Just be happy with your life because it is your life and happiness", "NTA sounds like your family are really unsupportive of the way you\u2019ve chosen to live your life", "NTA.

Being in a relationship isn't a life requirement", "NTA.\n\nBeing constantly questioned on your choices in life, who wouldn\u2019t get fed up with it? You aren\u2019t ruining your life by choosing to be single. Relationships aren\u2019t a priority in life, having kids is not a priority in life. You wasn\u2019t being over dramatic, how you reacted is completely understandable", "NTA, it needed saying and you said it, it's way better than finding some lame excuse to spare their feelings.

They are being rude and over bearing.\n\nIf you were anti child or being awful about their relationships would be equally as rude...but you aren't. \n\nWanting to I've your life and enjoy it is absolutely reasonable... they need to accept and love you as you are or understand that you will keep your distance.", "Nta, my mom pulled that suff on me all the time, so I know how annoyed you are.

Your career is obviously important to you and unfortunately majority of the time women take a hit in their careers when they have families. You have your own life and it\u2019s up to you how you want to spend your time. \n\nI also don\u2019t want to make any assumptions, but statistically usually men in heterosexual relationships often shirk the majority of the domestic labor related to their home and children. It\u2019s likely easy for your brother to talk about how great being a dad is when he doesn\u2019t have to do all of the heavy lifting or use much of his time and energy related to that.

You can maybe revisit this when your calmer and have had a chance to pre-articulate your feelings before sitting down with them/ writing to them to make sure they understand the impact this is having, and how you would like it to change. \nThey can respect this or not, but you're NTA in this at alllll", "Irrelevant.
