It was Seth\u2019s birthday and he really wanted to celebrate by watching some movie I\u2019ve never seen, eating pizza, and playing video games. I was totally on board with the plan. \n\nThey were getting the movie set up in the basement and I was grabbing some slices of pizza and a drink upstairs when I started having a panic attack. I don\u2019t know what gender I am and I couldn\u2019t think of anything else in that moment. I was in tears by the time I got downstairs. \n\nRyan asked me what was wrong and I completely broke down. I said I\u2019m questioning my gender. They really tried to help me out and kept saying that they would support me no matter what and I didn\u2019t need to worry so much in that moment. So the conversation went on for like 3 hours and I was crying most of the time. Seth barely said anything for the last hour or two. By the time we were done talking, it was slightly late and the two guys said they needed some sleep. So that was the end of that. \n\nYesterday (the day after) I was talking to Ryan about it and he said Seth was really upset, because I \u201ctook over his birthday\u201d and made it all about me. I know we didn\u2019t get to watch the movie or play video games, but I think my problem was more important, and I couldn\u2019t control when it was bothering me. Ryan said that I could have told them whenever because we all live together. Tbh I have been thinking about it for awhile now but I never felt comfortable talking to them until that moment, when I was having a panic attack. \n\nRyan also said that Seth usually feels left out of stuff (especially celebrating his birthday) and this was all he wanted for his big day. So I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t think birthdays are that big of a deal. \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1675889384, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10xacdd/aita_for_talking_about_my_gender_identity_on_my/", "score": 42, "replies": ["#[Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).\r\n\r\nPlease review our [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq) if you're unsure what that means.", "YTA. It's really rude how you ruined his birthday and made it all about you. But what's worse is that instead of taking responsibility for your actions, you are now belittling him and justifying what you did.  \n\n\nHaving a panic attack is out of your control - traumadumping for three hours at someone's birthday party is a choice you made. A selfish, immature choice that was disrespectful to other people. \n\nNews flash: YOU don't get to decide whether his birthday is a big deal, and frankly you sound like a real asshole putting your needs over others. Your problem is not 'more important' - it's YOUR problem, not theirs, and you don't get to dump on people about it for three hours without their consent. Consent! Does that word have meaning to you? You are displaying incredibly selfish and entitled behavior. You deserve support while you explore your gender - the way to get that support is not by mistreating, traumadumping and belittling others.", "Seth \"barely said anything the last **hour or two**?\"   So he hung in there with you crying during movie/pizza/video game/birthday time for a good hour or two?  Good on Seth. \n\nThis was beyond excessive on your end. If you're prone to breakdowns you need to learn how to handle them better than this.  YTA.", "YTA. There are many layers of \u201cme\u201d in this and not a lot (or any) effort to see thing from Seth\u2019s perspective and support him.

And you took the sails out of his celebration to focus on your issues.\n\nAlso, you may not be able to control when it bothers you, but you're 24. You should be able to control when you make it a big deal with others. Expecting others to give up their birthday celebration to focus on your issues isn't fair.

No one controls when they have a panic attack, but to inflict a 3-hour therapy session on your friends during a birthday party is just straight up obnoxious. C'mon dude get a grip.", "YTA,  you couldn't help having a panic attack, you COULD have chosen to excuse yourself for some vague reason and allowed Seth to celebrate HIS Birthday.  Have your panic attack over your identify elsewhere, quietly...or you could have waited.  Your gender identity crisis was YOURS.  Gosh, they even had to say they needed some sleep to get away from your drama.\n\nThat you think 'birthdays are no big deal' only applies to YOUR birthday, not Seth's birthday.  You are surely  not that self-absorbed to realize this?\n\nI am glad Ryan told you how deeply this affected Seth.  This obviously bothered Ryan as well.", "YTA\n\nNothing triggered your panic attack into the whole scenario except you.

The panic attack you might not be able to help, but letting it go in for 3 hours is ridiculous and birthday ruining.  You owe them an apology.", "YTA\n\nNot for nothing, but it low key seems like you wanted to sabotage Seth's birthday. YOU don't think birthdays are a big deal.

You made *everything* about you. What a narcissist.", "YTA\n\n\nI would have given you a pass if you didn't keep it up for 3 FUCKING HOURS. I literally cannot imagine crying that long over anything, let alone not knowing what gender you are. I dated a girl who had semi-frequent panic attacks for 2 years, and the longest she ever had was like 30 minutes tops. At that point you're just being an attention seeking narcissist.", "Yta. And that is strictly because you are completely invalidating your friend. It's okay if you view your birthday as \"not a big deal\" but to imply his birthday shouldn't be a big deal is really rude. It sounds like you have a good support system, and it was out of your control when the anxiety kicked it, but now that you know that Seth feels upset about missing a birthday (which is a very valid feeling) the right thing to do would be to arrange a new low-key birthday/ movie night for your friend.", "YTA.  Keep your issues to yourself when other people are supposed to have the spotlight.", "YTA. Just because you don\u2019t think birthdays are a big deal doesn\u2019t mean someone else doesn\u2019t deserve to have a day to celebrate. You need to be in therapy. Panic attacks happen - it\u2019s reasonable that you can\u2019t always control when they happen or how they manifest. However, you need to figure out how to manage them. If you had been at work would you have shut down for three hours? What about while driving or taking public transportation? You need to work on some coping and communication skills to help you manage them. You need to apologize to your friend and set aside a new day to celebrate their birthday- because even though you don\u2019t think it was a big deal, you don\u2019t know their emotions around birthdays or how that translates to their own self worth. You\u2019re saying your panic attack was more important than them- so important that you don\u2019t feel remotely bad about the fact that they didn\u2019t get to celebrate the way they had planned. What does that say about how you value them as a person? That your immediate crisis was so much more important than them that they don\u2019t deserve to get a day to celebrate who they are? That\u2019s not okay. You should apologize and make it up to them- friends are valuable people. They deserve to be shown they\u2019re valuable, even when our own crises cause us to lean on them more or cancel plans- all the more reason to celebrate them.", "I'm going to go with YTA.  \n\n\nAt first I was like \"wow, no one is in the wrong here it's just a crappy situation...\" but your attitude post-situation makes me think yta.\n\nYou can't help having a panic attack (most of the time) but you CAN help how to treat your BEST FRIENDS after the fact.  \nApologize and throw a birthday v2.0, and since he \"usually feels left out of stuff (especially celebrating his birthday)\" make it AMAZING for him. Maybe not one evening but an entire day. I think he deserves it.", "YTA. Sharing is okay. But you hijacked a birthday with a THREE HOUR therapy session. Honestly, that's a lot.

Shitty asswipe move.\nYou may wear the asshat.", "YTA\n\nSorry. if you started having a random panic attack on someone's birthday, you should have excused yourself and went into your bedroom until got yourself together.

It is difficult, but you have to learn to control yourself if you expect to keep your friends.   \n\nYou're just 24 now so haven't experienced it yet, but between age 25 and 30 guys typically shed any drama prone friends as they pursue their own life goals with career and relationships.   They may still care, but they realize they don't have any room in their lives for outside drama anymore.   So you've got to get yourself together.", "YTA. When you have mental health issues (panic attack, not gender identity), you can\u2019t always control when you have an episode.

That\u2019s not to say they aren\u2019t important, they are very important. They just aren\u2019t more important. \n\nIt\u2019s shit like this that drives our friends away from us, making us feel more isolated and alone in a world where loneliness is already an epidemic of dangerous proportions.

I DO understand that panic attacks can come on quickly and without warning and I\u2019m sorry you went through that, but if it\u2019s something you\u2019ve been dealing with long term you should have set yourself up for help long before it got that bad. \n\nYou be you honey.. but don\u2019t let what\u2019s going on in today\u2019s society make your decisions either.

Though, it seems you would like to be the exception...", "YTA - Not for what happened, but your perspective on it. Yes it's a big deal, you took over Seth's birthday.

Someones already planned out birthday is not it. You should really apologize.", "YTA. Panic attacks happen.

You don\u2019t get to dictate what is a \u201cbig deal\u201d for anybody other than yourself.

You weren\u2019t having a panic attack for 3 hours, you were milking it because it\u2019s personal to you & you were getting attention for it.

The fact you added that you don\u2019t think birthdays are a big deal at the end shows you lack empathy and are being real self absorbed. Your opinion on birthdays doesn\u2019t matter, it was his birthday and it mattered to him. Think if it this way, if I said you questioning your gender didn\u2019t matter because you were DMAB, would that make it matter any less to you?

If you don't check yourself every now and again, you will start losing friendships. This wasn't an issue of you needing a friend. This was an ongoing issue that your friends cannot help you with. You wanted to vent your fears/frustrations out when that's all this was about. The only thing they can give you is their reassurance that they will accept you no matter what gender you go with. That isn't good enough for you though. You may have had a moment of anxiety, but you snowballed it into a \"you\" session.", "Unfortunately I would have to say YTA. Please know that I don't blame you for having a mental breakdown, and I can't imagine what you were truly going through. However, you would be TA just because this was someone's special day, their birthday celebration they invited you to, and they had plans that ended up not happening because of your situation. Also the fact that you still find it uncomfortable to apologize to him (as stated in your reply to another comment below), it's honestly the least you can do and you haven't been able to do that.\n\n Just like no one knew what you were going through, you don't know what's going through Seth's head and what celebrating his birthday meant to him.

Although friends are there to support you, it doesn't mean that you should always expect them to or that they *have* to. They should still be given the option wether or not they themselves have the mental capacity to support you and what you're going through. Everyone's own mental capacity is more important over all else. They were not given the option, and expected to support you.", "YTA. Not for feel dysregulated on Seth's birthday, but for thinking his birthday wasn't that big of a deal.\n\nIn the moment, your needs could've seemed more pressing than Seth's.

Because his emotional needs aren't importent to you.", "YTA \nThe main reason I think this is because you said your issue was more important  than his birthday. I do agree with you but that is completely unfair as it was Seth\u2019s party and it was about him and it was a day where he got to be important. I understand you don\u2019t control when you have a panic attack but you could have apologised and organised another party for him as supposed to just moving on.

Watch the movie and order pizza and make a night of it as a way to kinda make up for it. I think he would probably really appreciate a gesture like that.\n\nETA: It\u2019s also extremely helpful to learn how to manage panic attacks, trust me.

DBT therapy worked wonders for me.)", "I wouldn't criticise you for having a panic attack and being upset. This is important and I'm glad your friends were there to help.

It was Seth\u2019s birthday and he really wanted to celebrate by watching some movie I\u2019ve never seen, eating pizza, and playing video games. I was totally on board with the plan. \n\nThey were getting the movie set up in the basement and I was grabbing some slices of pizza and a drink upstairs when I started having a panic attack. I don\u2019t know what gender I am and I couldn\u2019t think of anything else in that moment. I was in tears by the time I got downstairs. \n\nRyan asked me what was wrong and I completely broke down. I said I\u2019m questioning my gender. They really tried to help me out and kept saying that they would support me no matter what and I didn\u2019t need to worry so much in that moment. So the conversation went on for like 3 hours and I was crying most of the time. Seth barely said anything for the last hour or two. By the time we were done talking, it was slightly late and the two guys said they needed some sleep. So that was the end of that. \n\nYesterday (the day after) I was talking to Ryan about it and he said Seth was really upset, because I \u201ctook over his birthday\u201d and made it all about me. I know we didn\u2019t get to watch the movie or play video games, but I think my problem was more important, and I couldn\u2019t control when it was bothering me. Ryan said that I could have told them whenever because we all live together. Tbh I have been thinking about it for awhile now but I never felt comfortable talking to them until that moment, when I was having a panic attack. \n\nRyan also said that Seth usually feels left out of stuff (especially celebrating his birthday) and this was all he wanted for his big day. So I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t think birthdays are that big of a deal. \n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
