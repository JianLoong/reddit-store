It was Seth\u2019s birthday and he really wanted to celebrate by watching some movie I\u2019ve never seen, eating pizza, and playing video games. I was totally on board with the plan. \n\nThey were getting the movie set up in the basement and I was grabbing some slices of pizza and a drink upstairs when I started having a panic attack. I don\u2019t know what gender I am and I couldn\u2019t think of anything else in that moment. I was in tears by the time I got downstairs. \n\nRyan asked me what was wrong and I completely broke down. I said I\u2019m questioning my gender. They really tried to help me out and kept saying that they would support me no matter what and I didn\u2019t need to worry so much in that moment. So the conversation went on for like 3 hours and I was crying most of the time. Seth barely said anything for the last hour or two. By the time we were done talking, it was slightly late and the two guys said they needed some sleep. So that was the end of that. \n\nYesterday (the day after) I was talking to Ryan about it and he said Seth was really upset, because I \u201ctook over his birthday\u201d and made it all about me. I know we didn\u2019t get to watch the movie or play video games, but I think my problem was more important, and I couldn\u2019t control when it was bothering me. Ryan said that I could have told them whenever because we all live together. Tbh I have been thinking about it for awhile now but I never felt comfortable talking to them until that moment, when I was having a panic attack. \n\nRyan also said that Seth usually feels left out of stuff (especially celebrating his birthday) and this was all he wanted for his big day. So I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t think birthdays are that big of a deal. \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1675889384, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10xacdd/aita_for_talking_about_my_gender_identity_on_my/", "score": 634, "replies": ["#[Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).\r\n\r\nPlease review our [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq) if you're unsure what that means.", "YTA. It's really rude how you ruined his birthday and made it all about you. But what's worse is that instead of taking responsibility for your actions, you are now belittling him and justifying what you did.  \n\n\nHaving a panic attack is out of your control - traumadumping for three hours at someone's birthday party is a choice you made. A selfish, immature choice that was disrespectful to other people. \n\nNews flash: YOU don't get to decide whether his birthday is a big deal, and frankly you sound like a real asshole putting your needs over others. Your problem is not 'more important' - it's YOUR problem, not theirs, and you don't get to dump on people about it for three hours without their consent. Consent! Does that word have meaning to you? You are displaying incredibly selfish and entitled behavior. You deserve support while you explore your gender - the way to get that support is not by mistreating, traumadumping and belittling others.", "Seth \"barely said anything the last **hour or two**?\"   So he hung in there with you crying during movie/pizza/video game/birthday time for a good hour or two?  Good on Seth. \n\nThis was beyond excessive on your end. If you're prone to breakdowns you need to learn how to handle them better than this.  YTA.", "YTA. There are many layers of \u201cme\u201d in this and not a lot (or any) effort to see thing from Seth\u2019s perspective and support him.

And you took the sails out of his celebration to focus on your issues.\n\nAlso, you may not be able to control when it bothers you, but you're 24. You should be able to control when you make it a big deal with others. Expecting others to give up their birthday celebration to focus on your issues isn't fair.

No one controls when they have a panic attack, but to inflict a 3-hour therapy session on your friends during a birthday party is just straight up obnoxious. C'mon dude get a grip.", "YTA,  you couldn't help having a panic attack, you COULD have chosen to excuse yourself for some vague reason and allowed Seth to celebrate HIS Birthday.  Have your panic attack over your identify elsewhere, quietly...or you could have waited.  Your gender identity crisis was YOURS.  Gosh, they even had to say they needed some sleep to get away from your drama.\n\nThat you think 'birthdays are no big deal' only applies to YOUR birthday, not Seth's birthday.  You are surely  not that self-absorbed to realize this?\n\nI am glad Ryan told you how deeply this affected Seth.  This obviously bothered Ryan as well.", "YTA\n\nNothing triggered your panic attack into the whole scenario except you.

The panic attack you might not be able to help, but letting it go in for 3 hours is ridiculous and birthday ruining.  You owe them an apology.", "YTA\n\nNot for nothing, but it low key seems like you wanted to sabotage Seth's birthday. YOU don't think birthdays are a big deal.

You made *everything* about you. What a narcissist.", "YTA\n\n\nI would have given you a pass if you didn't keep it up for 3 FUCKING HOURS. I literally cannot imagine crying that long over anything, let alone not knowing what gender you are. I dated a girl who had semi-frequent panic attacks for 2 years, and the longest she ever had was like 30 minutes tops. At that point you're just being an attention seeking narcissist.", "Yta. And that is strictly because you are completely invalidating your friend. It's okay if you view your birthday as \"not a big deal\" but to imply his birthday shouldn't be a big deal is really rude. It sounds like you have a good support system, and it was out of your control when the anxiety kicked it, but now that you know that Seth feels upset about missing a birthday (which is a very valid feeling) the right thing to do would be to arrange a new low-key birthday/ movie night for your friend.", "YTA.  Keep your issues to yourself when other people are supposed to have the spotlight.", "YTA. Just because you don\u2019t think birthdays are a big deal doesn\u2019t mean someone else doesn\u2019t deserve to have a day to celebrate. You need to be in therapy. Panic attacks happen - it\u2019s reasonable that you can\u2019t always control when they happen or how they manifest. However, you need to figure out how to manage them. If you had been at work would you have shut down for three hours? What about while driving or taking public transportation? You need to work on some coping and communication skills to help you manage them. You need to apologize to your friend and set aside a new day to celebrate their birthday- because even though you don\u2019t think it was a big deal, you don\u2019t know their emotions around birthdays or how that translates to their own self worth. You\u2019re saying your panic attack was more important than them- so important that you don\u2019t feel remotely bad about the fact that they didn\u2019t get to celebrate the way they had planned. What does that say about how you value them as a person? That your immediate crisis was so much more important than them that they don\u2019t deserve to get a day to celebrate who they are? That\u2019s not okay. You should apologize and make it up to them- friends are valuable people. They deserve to be shown they\u2019re valuable, even when our own crises cause us to lean on them more or cancel plans- all the more reason to celebrate them.", "I'm going to go with YTA.  \n\n\nAt first I was like \"wow, no one is in the wrong here it's just a crappy situation...\" but your attitude post-situation makes me think yta.\n\nYou can't help having a panic attack (most of the time) but you CAN help how to treat your BEST FRIENDS after the fact.  \nApologize and throw a birthday v2.0, and since he \"usually feels left out of stuff (especially celebrating his birthday)\" make it AMAZING for him. Maybe not one evening but an entire day. I think he deserves it.", "YTA. Sharing is okay. But you hijacked a birthday with a THREE HOUR therapy session. Honestly, that's a lot.

Just becouse YOU dont care about birthdays doesnt mean someone else dont! Your friend wanted to watch a movie and play games with two of his friends and you made it all about you for three hours and then complains when you found out about him being hurt cuz of it, becouse you just had to have that moment about yourself regardless....\nSo they are supposed to be there for you but you wont do the same? \nJust shitty. Shitty asswipe move.\nYou may wear the asshat.", "YTA\n\nSorry. if you started having a random panic attack on someone's birthday, you should have excused yourself and went into your bedroom until got yourself together.

It is difficult, but you have to learn to control yourself if you expect to keep your friends.   \n\nYou're just 24 now so haven't experienced it yet, but between age 25 and 30 guys typically shed any drama prone friends as they pursue their own life goals with career and relationships.   They may still care, but they realize they don't have any room in their lives for outside drama anymore.   So you've got to get yourself together.", "YTA. When you have mental health issues (panic attack, not gender identity), you can\u2019t always control when you have an episode.

That\u2019s not to say they aren\u2019t important, they are very important. They just aren\u2019t more important. \n\nIt\u2019s shit like this that drives our friends away from us, making us feel more isolated and alone in a world where loneliness is already an epidemic of dangerous proportions.

I DO understand that panic attacks can come on quickly and without warning and I\u2019m sorry you went through that, but if it\u2019s something you\u2019ve been dealing with long term you should have set yourself up for help long before it got that bad. \n\nYou be you honey.. but don\u2019t let what\u2019s going on in today\u2019s society make your decisions either.

Though, it seems you would like to be the exception...", "YTA - Not for what happened, but your perspective on it. Yes it's a big deal, you took over Seth's birthday. He's perfectly right to be upset and you should be sorry and apologize.\n\nSometimes things that are out of your control, but you're still responsible for, are yours to fix/apologize and try to improve.\n\nThink of it this way: if you had uncontrollable illness and accidentally had projectile diarrhea all over Seth's place...

Someones already planned out birthday is not it. You should really apologize.", "YTA. Panic attacks happen.

You don\u2019t get to dictate what is a \u201cbig deal\u201d for anybody other than yourself.

You weren\u2019t having a panic attack for 3 hours, you were milking it because it\u2019s personal to you & you were getting attention for it.

The fact you added that you don\u2019t think birthdays are a big deal at the end shows you lack empathy and are being real self absorbed. Your opinion on birthdays doesn\u2019t matter, it was his birthday and it mattered to him. Think if it this way, if I said you questioning your gender didn\u2019t matter because you were DMAB, would that make it matter any less to you?

If you don't check yourself every now and again, you will start losing friendships. This wasn't an issue of you needing a friend. This was an ongoing issue that your friends cannot help you with. You wanted to vent your fears/frustrations out when that's all this was about. The only thing they can give you is their reassurance that they will accept you no matter what gender you go with. That isn't good enough for you though. You may have had a moment of anxiety, but you snowballed it into a \"you\" session.", "Unfortunately I would have to say YTA. Please know that I don't blame you for having a mental breakdown, and I can't imagine what you were truly going through. However, you would be TA just because this was someone's special day, their birthday celebration they invited you to, and they had plans that ended up not happening because of your situation. Also the fact that you still find it uncomfortable to apologize to him (as stated in your reply to another comment below), it's honestly the least you can do and you haven't been able to do that.\n\n Just like no one knew what you were going through, you don't know what's going through Seth's head and what celebrating his birthday meant to him.

Although friends are there to support you, it doesn't mean that you should always expect them to or that they *have* to. They should still be given the option wether or not they themselves have the mental capacity to support you and what you're going through. Everyone's own mental capacity is more important over all else. They were not given the option, and expected to support you.", "YTA. Not for feel dysregulated on Seth's birthday, but for thinking his birthday wasn't that big of a deal.\n\nIn the moment, your needs could've seemed more pressing than Seth's.

Because his emotional needs aren't importent to you.", "YTA \nThe main reason I think this is because you said your issue was more important  than his birthday. I do agree with you but that is completely unfair as it was Seth\u2019s party and it was about him and it was a day where he got to be important. I understand you don\u2019t control when you have a panic attack but you could have apologised and organised another party for him as supposed to just moving on. I think Seth was completely justified in his anger and I would probably be feeling the same as Seth if I was in his position.", "YTA\n\nI have very severe anxiety (I\u2019m talking 3-4 extreme panic attacks *every day*) so I\u2019m not saying YTA for having a panic attack. \n\nYTA because you said you felt your problem was \u201cmore important\u201d and that \u201cbirthdays aren\u2019t a big deal.\u201d His birthday was important to him, this isn\u2019t a \u201cwhich thing is more important\u201d situation.

Watch the movie and order pizza and make a night of it as a way to kinda make up for it. I think he would probably really appreciate a gesture like that.\n\nETA: It\u2019s also extremely helpful to learn how to manage panic attacks, trust me.

DBT therapy worked wonders for me.)", "I wouldn't criticise you for having a panic attack and being upset. This is important and I'm glad your friends were there to help.

It was Seth\u2019s birthday and he really wanted to celebrate by watching some movie I\u2019ve never seen, eating pizza, and playing video games. I was totally on board with the plan. \n\nThey were getting the movie set up in the basement and I was grabbing some slices of pizza and a drink upstairs when I started having a panic attack. I don\u2019t know what gender I am and I couldn\u2019t think of anything else in that moment. I was in tears by the time I got downstairs. \n\nRyan asked me what was wrong and I completely broke down. I said I\u2019m questioning my gender. They really tried to help me out and kept saying that they would support me no matter what and I didn\u2019t need to worry so much in that moment. So the conversation went on for like 3 hours and I was crying most of the time. Seth barely said anything for the last hour or two. By the time we were done talking, it was slightly late and the two guys said they needed some sleep. So that was the end of that. \n\nYesterday (the day after) I was talking to Ryan about it and he said Seth was really upset, because I \u201ctook over his birthday\u201d and made it all about me. I know we didn\u2019t get to watch the movie or play video games, but I think my problem was more important, and I couldn\u2019t control when it was bothering me. Ryan said that I could have told them whenever because we all live together. Tbh I have been thinking about it for awhile now but I never felt comfortable talking to them until that moment, when I was having a panic attack. \n\nRyan also said that Seth usually feels left out of stuff (especially celebrating his birthday) and this was all he wanted for his big day. So I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t think birthdays are that big of a deal. \n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I\u2019m open to message if you want to talk some more!", "I have a few friends in their late 30's who tend to disrupt events or make excuses for themselves based on their perceived problems, so it's not just 20 year olds. I've suffered from anxiety disorder and panic attacks my whole life, but I would never even think about throwing a tantrum at someone else's bachelorette weekend because I didn't get the bed I wanted and blame it on panic attacks (this happened). I have another friend who is always bringing up her ADHD - or whatever disorder she has at the moment - at every opportunity. \"Oh, I was looking at my phone during poker and it takes me 10 minutes every time to realize it's my turn? It's my ADHD! Aren't I quirky?\"\n\nFor the love of God, people. Learn to be functioning adults and stop it with the main character syndrome.", "I just shut down my Instagram because to me it\u2019s such a illusion of fakery. Someone even said to me once\u2026 followers are EVERYTHING.. um ok.. I get that they can make money but my God. I can\u2019t imagine shaping my whole life around that and losing my shit if it didn\u2019t work out.", "This person has problems,  I've question my gender before and I definitely did get stressed out a bit but never to the extent of crying over it ... especially not for three hours on someone's birthday that's just crazy ... and they need a therapist or they are doing it for attention ... even then see a therapist because why would someone need attention at the expense of their friends ?", "I dunno, maybe I'm just a thick skinned peasant, my family is like \"well noone has died so all good, and if someone died the living come first\". So maybe I'm just too insensitive for those things.", "I mean, maybe. I'm a trans guy and it's been rough but I have definitely never had a panic attack about it out of the blue and cried for 3 hours. And if I do, I do that shit at home, thank you very much.\n\nPeople handle things differently. But OP should have been able to control that, and if they can't, then honestly, they shouldn't have been at the party. Seeking support from friends is okay, but this was super inappropriate. \n\nI have PTSD. Had a huge breakdown at age 18 after I got ass-blasted drunk with some friends (who I hadn't known long \ud83d\ude2c) where I went through flashbacks and was freaking the fuck out. To this day I feel fucking horrible about it and want to sink into the ground and die out of sheer embarrassment when I think about it.\n\nIt wasn't a great thing to do, and I don't believe that they were truly unable to gain control for *three hours.* But what makes it worse is the doubling down and being an asshole about it afterwards. For fuck's sake. The world does not revolve around you.\n\nYou simply have to learn that no matter *what* issues you have, if you hurt someone, whether because of those issues or not, they have no obligation to forgive you.", "I'm a cis woman, except I want to have the patriarchal traditional male gender role. Couldn't find a label for it  although probably would have done stupid things as teen if things were more accessible then because used to confuse the gender role with having a penis.", "This sounds like a great way to handle it.", "Yeah, IF  OP had done something like this, it would be NTA.", "Still would be TA because you can have a short discussion but if you can\u2019t get your panic under control, you excuse yourself from the party. Don\u2019t blame your panic attacks and gender discussion when they drop you as friends. It will be because you\u2019re self-centered. (By you I mean OP)", "T H I S !\nI completely agree!", "**Holy shit I just assumed they were literally 15**\n\nLike I read the ages at the start but then when I read the rest I forgot and just read it like they were teenagers.\n\nThis is 15 year old behaviour. And honestly pretty insufferable / exhausting 15 year olds at that.", "idk about mental toughness being an aspect if what OP stated as a panic attack was an actual panic attack. You can't control those.\n\nHowever OP is definitely TA, he could 100% have removed himself from the situation and calmed himself down elsewhere to let his roommate have his birthday.", "I'm 32 and struggle with anxiety. Used to have panick attack often, but handle it better with the right medication and therapy. Age doesn't matter. Sometimes, your brain chemistry is unbalanced, and your body physically can't stabalize it.", "Hey, panic attacks happen to people of all ages. It has nothing to do with mental toughness. Some of the toughest people in the world have panic attacks.", "I agree, but since this *is* about OPs gender dysphoria, maybe refer to them as them?", "I would be absolutely horrified and so embarrassed if I had a panic attack bad enough that it completely took over and ruined someone else\u2019s event. I\u2019d be apologetic to the point of grovelling and absolutely insist on throwing them a do-over party at my own expense. It\u2019s just common courtesy at that point.", "I had a panic attack so bad at work that my coworker/close friend had to drive me to her apartment on her lunch break, help me take my Xanax, and let me rest at her place for the rest of the day and kept checking in on me multiple times a day for a few days. It was triggered by something that happened at work and I ended having to quit because I knew it would happen again if I went back. \n\nI was mortified! I can\u2019t even begin to explain how awful I felt for not only making her worry so much, but also taking up her lunch break. I apologized and thanked her so so so many times and cooked her dinner at her place the next week. \n\nIf we happened to live together and it occurred during her birthday party, I would have told her what was happening and left for my room. I\u2019m sure she\u2019d still check on me and help me take my emergency med, but in now way shape or form would I have allowed myself to be the center of attention for 3 HOURS at her birthday party. And you\u2019re damn right I would have done something to make it up to her, like take her out the next night to celebrate her or anything she wanted. \n\nI\u2019m not diagnosing this person, I am saying this reeks of histrionic personally disorder. Again, not saying OP has that, I\u2019m saying someone with that would do this. \n\nI have a trans kid, and I\u2019ve seen the pain that goes along with questioning and hiding. I found out because it was so painful that my kid tried to unalive themself. They were so afraid to tell me despite how open I\u2019ve always been about my support for the LGBTQ+ community and am a member myself. So I want to be clear when I say, this person is TAH for not being the slightest bit remorseful for ruining their friend\u2019s birthday and not making any effort to make it up to them. I would drop them as a friend after this and ask them to move out or move out myself if I could. I have zero doubt this is the first and/or last instance of this extremely selfish behavior.", "I have had panic attacks, and I always feel so guilty. I would definitely be trying to make it up by redoing the things that were planned originally.", "I mean the setting was highly inappropriate and OP is definitely TA here but people do, in fact, freak out over their gender identity. Especially when they don\u2019t realize it till they\u2019re older. However OP should\u2019ve excused themself and not dumped it on people during someone\u2019s birthday party if they couldn\u2019t get it together. But just saying, a freak out is fairly normal when it takes you over 20 years to realize that you\u2019re not cis.", "My guy. Sausage makes you question your sexual orientation. Pepperoni is for questioning your gender identity. Get it right.", "Right? I'm really confused by the sudden realization + panic attack + crying for 3 hours while ***getting Pizza***. If someone *at* the party had made some comment about OP being very femme presenting or something? I could *maybe* see it... but it sounds like it was just the 3 of them, and it literally \"came from nowhere\".", "\ud83d\ude02 too many choices \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "It was the olives. \n\nLove your response, too funny!", "Well, I was trying to be generous.  LOL", "You're spot on with Main Character Syndrome, that's exactly what this is.", "Can I just say I am 30 (just) and I totally agree with you folks.", "Aliens are looking down on us thinking how pathetic we are", "I think you\u2019re just their mom lol.", "My kids average out to 30 years old. We're a compassionate family. And we have our challenges.  And even my kids will moan \"Grow up. Suck it up.\" when they've had quite enough of the \"I'm special\" silliness.", "I would only add something to what you've mentioned.\n\nThe greatest generation came back from that war with PTSD that gave them nightly terrors in their sleep.  The death they watched beside them. The fear they felt that they would be next.  Mustard gas, new forms of war we're being invented by the week.  Trenches, disease ... Check out the movie \"Passchendaele\" for a good look.\n\nAnd a decade of the Great Depression.  There were no social supports.  I think that this was when governments started to figure out some social financial supports.\n\nI knew an old guy for many years. He was on one of the minesweepers that were at the front of everybody else when charging WWII D-Day.  He got to watch everything in living colour - lots of red.  His best friend since childhood happened to serve with him. Died beside him.\n\nDid you know that England was still on a food ration system until 1954?  I didn't know that until recently.\n\nWhat these generations did to rebuild their lives was astounding.  I am so glad that you recognize that they \"got to work\".  So many think only of their privilege as \"boomers\" who had things easier.  They don't stop to think of what they went through.  I am so glad you see that.  Thank you ... on behalf of my Grandfather who had to escape a Nazi-occupied country to fight from where he could, then build a new life in Canada.  It's actually quite a story.  And thank you from me too.", "That\u2019s true the only reason I used the word mess however was just to kind of conglomerate everything into one without having to go too into detail", "I agree with that too about things all have to seem to be a big spectacle and everything has to have to be wrapped up and put a label on instead of just.. living your life and enjoying it. At the risk of sounding like a jerk.. why does everything need to be some big announcement? Do what you like in your life as long as you\u2019re not hurting yourself or anyone else. Ignore the negativity!", "I appreciate that and believe me I work hard. I was actually having this conversation with my therapist today funny enough.", "I\u2019m in the same boat as you. Rub some dirt on it and move on.", "Im the same way which is probably why I am single lol.", "That\u2019s what I was wondering about, granted I don\u2019t know a whole lot of trans people, but the one one teo that I do knew what their gender was. Their panic attack wasn\u2019t about not knowing their gender but how to come to grips that they had to figure out a new life.", "for real, my gender is generally just the embodiment of the shrugging emoji bc it\u2019s such a moving target. And yes, it was insanely disconcerting and uncomfortable to deal with at first but *that was my problem and no one else\u2019s*. \nof course i had support but it\u2019s still not their job to listen to me like OP made their friends do. \n\neven in my absolute worst moments of drunken self hatred and panic (and there were MANY) it would\u2019ve been impossible to carry on like that for so long. and i couldn\u2019t dream of thinking i was in the right in those moments", "Yeah my family and I have had some really good conversations about how I know my gender thing isn\u2019t the same as gender roles things. But that\u2019s also *so* much easier to know now when gender roles themselves are being discarded in the right environments. I didn\u2019t need to long for the respect people used to only give men bc I was always treated with the same respect as my brother. I know I\u2019m lucky that I never had the gender role issues to also confuse my with actual gender. I can\u2019t imagine dealing with both of those at once! \n\nAlso, I intended my comment to be in response to someone else but I accidentally replied to you instead. All good though! I think you make a really interesting point that needs more consideration in general too! Just didn\u2019t want you to be confused when my comment disappeared to go where it was supposed to \ud83d\ude02", "The traditional patriarchal male role? Like, go to work, come home to a nice clean house, well-behaved children, and dinner on the table? Me too, friend; me too.", "instead OP doubled down on thinking they were the center of the universe.", "Especially since that line is a response to their friend feeling typically left out and then having his birthday taken over", "The post almost starts out dismissive -- 'some movie I've never seen' -- like how important can the movie be if OP has never seen it?\n\nUgh, so self-centred OP, ugh.", "Yeah, I don't think gender should be a big deal. Where does that leave OP?", "Personally don\u2019t think birthdays are a big deal, hate being put on the spot and the attention. That being said I think a 25 year old crying for 3 hours would annoy me regardless of the day. Don\u2019t know what they are going through but man, that\u2019s a bit much.", "SAME. I was reading the comments thinking \"these people should be more forgiving, teenagers gonna teenager.\"", "It really does sounds like a 15 yr old who doesn\u2019t know how to handle emotions or lack of attention.", "Exactly. combine that with the fact that their excuse for not talking about it at a different time was that they didn't feel comfortable to yet. On the surface that's perfectly reasonable, but when you think about it, it doesn't make sense in combination with their attitude after. If they were so uncomfortable to begin with, why were they so very comfortable having made an entire evening being about it?", "My automatic response to panic attacks is flight *because of the added anxiety of ruining others day*. Maybe it's not like that for everyone but damn I feel like I am going to die... Which I also know is a complete exaggeration... But damn I feel like I am going to die... I don't want to bother people with the \"hey I am not dying but it feels like I am\" confusion that is a panic attack.\n\nMy go-to is to hide in a stairwell or behind a fridge. I have no idea why the fridge none at all, but I've been found behind it a few time (time goes all weird for me during attacks, I have severe cptsd and can regress to when the events happened so I flash between being attacked and people looking for me behind a fridge... But that's only when it's REALLY bad... Usually it's just a stairwell)", "Good God, what if it was pineapple?", "Aww! I love this! And I hope you saw I did comment that not all are like that because they\u2019re not.

It\u2019s just another thing to figure out.", "Walk it off!", "I\u2019ve never heard that phrase before but I love it.", "Some people feel confusion, because it's like \"Am I sure? What if I'm faking it? Am I really this gender or is it just x making me think so?\" that type of thing.\n\nI *really* do not mean to come off as \"my experiences are universal\" but I just cannot comprehend this situation being truly uncontrollable. People do struggle and have anxiety about it, but it just... it really seems like \"pay attention to meeee\" is what happened here in the end. Panic attacks happen. Excuse yourself to a bathroom and collect yourself. If that doesn't work, call someone, or leave. It's just insanely inconsiderate.", "YUPPPP", "The fact that the birthday guy always feels left out is very likely because OP likes to be Center of attention and on someone else\u2019s birthday OP wouldn\u2019t be the Center. I think this was an egotistical power move. \n\nHad it been more legit I think there would have been more remorse afterwards over having ruined someone\u2019s birthday and feeling bad about the birthday boy feeling sad.

Seems incredibly narcissistic.", "It starts and ends dismissive", "Ive never cried over my gender.....id be mighty pissed if my birthday was ruined like this. Drama drama melodrama", "Yeahhhhhh I thought this too and wondered if I was being a close minded asshole\u2014gender is just *one* part of our identity. If it\u2019s stressing you out that much, you need to see someone and learn that not knowing is ok. Totally understandable how devastating it is to not have one\u2019s gender honored but op is spiraling for odd reasons?

I have never felt special or unique for having a sexuality other than straight - but it seems like *some* folk deem it as an exclusive club that you get into by assigning yourself a label. Labels are tools to better describe how you feel, which is great for people who need them, but it doesn't make you **special**. I think it's interesting the rise of people using they/them in addition to their original pronouns - almost seems like a way to align yourself with a community when it's advantageous to you.", "No I\u2019m just saying you\u2019re saying the person you\u2019re replying to is 35, has Tourette\u2019s anxiety and OCD - I\u2019m saying you may just be literally replying to your son. He probably has a Reddit account too!", "I think ultimately humans will be ok... We've gone through a lot of changes that we weren't originally meant for. But the interconnectedness of social media is definitely the biggest \"brain remapping\" change in the lifetime of anyone alive today. So it's easiest to see the growing pains it's causing. But humanity ebbs and flows and eventually we'll find a balance (...until the next big thing)\n\n\n\nThe biggest growing pain I see right now is, because we cannot achieve that perceived perfection, the culture has shifted to one of always finding blame and shame and tearing others down. Therapy will not work if people keep seeing their lives as everyone else's responsibility. One of the glaring examples of this is OP saying 24dmab (designated male at birth). They were not \"designated\" male, like the doctor was just alternating sexes for each birth arbitrarily. But yet OP subconsciously puts blame on society for choosing their sex when it's nobody's fault.", "I think people had just as much mental illness then, they just hid it more.", "I think the mental illness crisis today is due to people feeling more able to admit they have a mental illness, rather than it didn\u2019t exist in past generations. Which is a good thing, progression.", "Right? And the COST!!", "I think, respectfully, you\u2019re swinging too far in the other direction and coming across like OP\u2019s \u201cbirthdays aren\u2019t that big a deal.\u201d \n\nUltimately, what matters to someone having an identity crisis is their identity. They\u2019ll probably cry about it. If you haven\u2019t experienced that, you won\u2019t. Similarly, if you feel like you\u2019re getting left out and that no one celebrates your birthday, your buddy steamrolling your birthday is going to make you feel pretty down. \n\nNeither of them are being melodramatic - what they\u2019re both experiencing is valid. \n\nOP\u2019s an AH for not trying to reel in his emotions a little earlier in the evening to salvage his friend\u2019s birthday. I appreciate that a panic attack isn\u2019t planned, but the whole night didn\u2019t need to be dedicated to the discussion either.", "I knowwww it's so not normal. Boo hoo your a boy and you don't want to be, how long are you going to make others uncomfortable because your unhappy?", "I think it's the opposite of close-minded.

Ex: \"somebody left their bag, I wonder if they will come back for it\" \"the outfit they're wearing is fire af\" etc. I think people don't realize they use they/them like that because it's just never crossed their mind before and now that it's something you have think about it's difficult to grasp because you haven't thought of it that way.
