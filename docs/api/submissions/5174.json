{"id": 5174, "submission_id": "zqd7ku", "title": "AITA for going on a trip with my friend despite my girlfriend's ultimatum?", "selftext": "I (27M) have a best friend who we can call Abbie (24F). We met in high school and have been platonic best friends ever since. We never had an inkling of romance toward each other, and so she's just truly a platonic best friend.\n\nMy girlfriend, whom we can call Brittany (28F) understands this and really likes Abbie, and even considers Abbie a friend of her own. She's only ever had a problem with my friendship with Abbie once, when Abbie and I went to a bar together by ourselves while GF was studying, and I didn't tell her until she saw I posted about it on IG stories. She told me that she didn't want me hanging out with a girl one on one by ourselves, and I told her I don't do that with any other girl except Abbie. My GF said if I'm only doing it with Abbie, then I know it's wrong to do with a girl out of respect, but we didn't really see eye to eye and so we both moved on, and I haven't done it since.\n\nNow here is the issue: before me and Brittany started dating, Abbie and I planned a trip to Mexico by ourselves for spring break. I was talking to Brittany about it and how excited I was to go to Mexico, but Brittany was shocked and asked \"are you still going?\" I said obviously yes, I was, and she kind of gave a scoff. I felt she wanted to be invited, and so I asked if she wanted to go. She said I know she couldn't afford it since she's in law school. She told me that it's disrespectful and humiliating for me to go on a  trip, especially with another girl without her, and if I go on this trip with Abbie without her, I will be single when I get back.\n\nI told her that was crazy and that she's friends with Abbie too and knows that we are strictly platonic, but she doesn't care. I told her that I'm going regardless since I planned this trip before we even knew each other, but she just told me that I can go if I want, she just won't be here when I get back.\n\nAITA for still wanting to go on the trip, even when my girlfriend said no?\n\nEdited to say that me and Brittany have been together for seven months.

Your current gf has every right to feel uncomfortable with the situation, and to set personal boundaries regarding what she finds acceptable behavior in a bf. It doesn't sound as if you guys are very compatible on a deeper level and it's better to find these things out earlier in relationships and decide that maybe things just aren't the right fit.", "Whatever verdict you get from internet strangers won\u2019t change being dumped if you go.", "You are welcome to do whatever you want, but be prepared to be single once you get back.\n\nNo verdict is going to change that outcome. I don\u2019t think a bunch of internet strangers is going to change your GFs opinion on the situation. Unless you are planning on using the verdict to determine if you will break up or not.\n\nNAH. Girlfriend expect boundaries in the relationship. And for you, having friends of the opposite gender should be allowed. I just think you two are on different wavelengths and not compatible.", "I don't think you vacationing with a friend is disrespectful and I'm having a hard time picturing why it would be humiliating. But, I'm just not one for projecting my insecurities and making someone else responsible for my feelings. If you want to please your GF - don't go. But, know that no matter what you decide, you and your GF have very different ideas about how to be a couple. Start there, Work on that. Decide if you can deal with that part?\n\nNAH. I'd go on vacation just because she gave me an ultimatum. Bye. I don't love anybody enough to put up with the nonsense. But, I'm good alone. Someone demanding I do things their way would break me. (Been there. Done that. No thanks.) You might really want to stay with your GF. Only you really know how you'll feel if you break with her?", "Unpopular opinion but ESH, you both never had a proper discussion about what will probably be a big issue in a long term relationship and you just assumed she\u2019d be fine with the trip. You\u2019re not TA for wanting to go to the trip with Abbie but for assuming this will be fine and your girlfriend is TA for giving an ultimatum. You both need to learn adult communication.", "NAH\n\nYou have a right to go, and she has a right to be comfortable with it (and made that clear LONG ago). You just have to get comfortable with being single if you do go.\n\n(Almost E S H for \u2018we both moved on\u2019 when what you both actually did was ignore the still very present problem.)", "Are you sharing a room during the trip?", "For just a second, I'll leave out the 'going on a trip with a platonic female friend'. I'll get back to it after, I promise.\n\nYour GF told you that something bothered her a lot. You both knew you didn't see eye to eye on it. But you went ~~and made~~ ahead with plans to do that thing even moreso without talking to your GF about it.\n\nAnd you're surprised that she's surprised in a bad way?\n\nYou decided to just ignore her problem with it because you didn't agree, even though going on a trip with Abbie is far more than going to a bar with her.\n\nHow did you think you could just steamroll past this problem this way?\n\nIf you respect your GF and her feelings, you should have discussed this with her, knowing it's a point of contention. You were an AH to just expect her to accept it without discussion.\n\nYou also should have invited her before she got upset about it.\n\nOn to the specifics. An ultimatum is an ultimatum. You can choose your option as long as you accept the outcome. So you can go on your trip and be single when you get back, and you absolutely cannot call Brittany crazy for that when you haven't made any effort at all to resolve the disagreement. You made your own bed with that.\n\nAs to whether Brittany should be so mad about it, I personally don't think so. But you're not dating me, you're dating Brittany. And Brittany doesn't want to date someone who goes on trips to Mexico alone with a girl who is not her. That's her prerogative. I think Brittany should reconsider, and maybe you could have asked her to.\n\nBut you didn't even respect her enough to prioritise resolving this conflict with her, and instead just insisted you're going ahead without any consideration of her feelings. So yeah YTA for acting like you're partner's concerns are irrelevant just because you don't agree with them.", "Like, lots of info:\n\nInfo: How long have you been with your gf?\n\nInfo: Y'all are going on Spring break together... are y'all going to the same school? Not to judge, but y'all seem much older to be going on Spring break?\n\nInfo: You say no romantic inkling, but has ANYTHING ever happened?\n\nI'm not sure it's relevant, but you're best friends with someone who you met when they were 15 and you were 18 / about to graduate?", "NAH. You're allowed to go, and your gf is allowed to leave. If the trip is worth losing your gf, have at it. She'll find someone soon enough who respects her boundaries, no loss to her.", "NTA for me. You were friends with Abbie before your gf. Guys and girl's can be just friend's without anything happening. I have a lot of guy friends that nothing ever happens. Im like one of the guys. I have a boyfriend that does not mind at all", "NTA.  A romantic partner does not get to dictate who you can and cannot be friends with.  No one individual has exclusive rights to your time and platonic companionship.  Now, that being said, this is probably the end of your relationship - like do you *want* to remain in a relationship with someone who doesn't allow you to be alone with a friend?  I'd say you've stumbled into a pretty major red flag and may have accidentally done yourself a favor in finding out she has issues with jealousy and control before it got too serious.", "Based on your comments, Id say NAH. I get ypur GF side. And her boundaries matter. But they shouldnt control your life.\n\nGiven that you planned the trip before you even started dating, and invited her to come i feel like you made reasonable accomodations. \n\nAlso, \"you cant go to bars with female friends\" maybe this is the wisconsin culture but we go to bars with everyone so this feels unreasonable.", "NTA. Your GF can request things, but you are an independent person (just as she is) with rights to make your own choices. Red flag on the field. I could understand if your GF wanted to JOIN you, and you should invite her to do so.", "YTA. If you had this planned for ages, you should have brought it up with her when she was angry about you going to the bar together. You knew she wouldn't like the idea of your trip with Abbie, which is why you didn't bring it up again sooner. \n\nAlso, I can't help but notice that your language towards Abbie is a lot nicer than the language you use for Brittany. Even the fact that in the fake names, Abbie comes first. I get that she's your best friend, but your girlfriend is always going to want to be your number 1 priority.", "YTA for pretending to have new boundaries with your friend when you do not.\n\nYou stopped going out 1:1 with your friend because your girlfriend didn\u2019t like it, all the while planning an entire vacation with her!\n\nYou and your girlfriend are incompatible, and you shouldn\u2019t have strung her along.", "NAH. You can go to your trip and she can decide that that's her boundary, and you crossing it results in breaking up. If everyone is fine with this situation then no problem", "ESH/NAH I guess. It\u2019s definitely a bit weird to me, and I would not be okay with my boyfriend going on a trip to Mexico alone with another girl. But if you care more about this trip/your relationship with Abbie, that\u2019s your priority and setting your priorities is okay. But i also think you\u2019re being obtuse. Unless Abbie was a lesbian or your sister, I have a hard time believing any girlfriend would ever be okay with this.", "Keep in mind that you made those plans when you were single. You are not single anymore. If you want to stay in the relationship, you should really consider covering her cost to join you on the trip, if that's possible.\n\nThis is a tuff one about going without her or not. If the friend was a sister, it wouldn't be an issue. But the problem is she is not. I think you would be hard-pressed finding a girlfriend that would be OK with it.\n\nIf you don't see a future with this girl, go on the trip. But if you want a future with her, you may need to reconsider your plans.", "Whether a platonic vacation is a good or bad idea objectively, GF sounds pretty jealous about it.  Only OP knows whether she has cause to feel that, of course, but jealousy is a toxic chemical that will burn a relationship out.  I'd say maybe GF has it right, time to go, but maybe not for the reasons she thinks.\n\nESH.  GF's ultimatum over a vacation OP planned before she dated him is bad, but she's been warning OP for quite a while about your relationship with Abby so this is not unexpected.", "NTA", "NTA, I\u2019ll never understand people setting rules for who their partner can be friends with. Either you trust your partner or you don\u2019t, and I promise you if your partner is gonna cheat that telling them not to be alone with the opposite sex isn\u2019t going to work", "NTA.\n\nBrittany is obviously far too insecure to be involved in any relationship outside of a junior high school. Doesn't want you to ever hang out with any other woman one on one?

It'll save you the cost of a divorce later. You're not a good match, and she'll carry resentment forever.

That is your future if you continue this relationship.", "NTA. Your girlfriend sounds insecure.", "NTA. Your GF is insecure.  Go on your trip & enjoy.

This could be a precursor of her trying to control you instead of trusting yog.", "NTA the plans were made before you guys got together go on the trip as long as you\u2019re okay with being single when you get back you\u2019ll be fine.", "i\u2019m going to go slight YTA mostly because it doesn\u2019t seem like you\u2019re being transparent about your friendship to your girlfriend. \n\nA lot of people have made really good points from both sides in the comments, what\u2019s getting me (as a girl with platonic guy friends) is how you haven\u2019t already discussed this with your girlfriend. Within like a couple months of dating my bf i was introducing him to my guy friends, and since we have an annual trip every year, i immediately invited him to come. I didn\u2019t tell him too late and then invite him when he got upset, I knew I wanted him there so I told him. So to me, it sounds like you didn\u2019t want your girlfriend there, which is fair it\u2019s you and your friend, but because you didn\u2019t bring it up at all it probably feels like you were hiding it, and it reminds her of you and your friend going to the bar without telling her, and even though you said you only did that once, it does feel like the start of a pattern, making plans with your girl best friend and leaving out your girlfriend. How many other little things like this have added up that might make your girlfriend feel insecure even if they were totally innocent?\n\nNow I hate ultimatums, they don\u2019t actually fix anything and there\u2019s usually just resentment. So I do think it\u2019s shitty of her to make one, especially considering plans that were made before your guys relationship started. This is something that should\u2019ve been a conversation early on, instead of waiting and then talking about it. \n\nAll in all, it feels like you guys don\u2019t have clear communication, don\u2019t have the same idea of boundaries with people that might be into you, and just might not be compatible. \n\nYou\u2019re not the asshole for wanting to go on your trip. YTA for not communicating clearly with your girlfriend", "NAH\n\nYou both can have your own opinions but if you go, you may not have a gf anymore.", "NTA, she's being manipulative, controlling,  and jealous. Enjoy yourself and the freedom. Better you get rid of her now than after years of this crap.", "ESH. I was team NTA until I read OPs response saying that nothing has been booked at this point.\n\n First, you can't depend on a bonus enough to send you to Mexico after a 3 year pandemic shut the world down, nobody can predict a bonus like that a year ago\nOn the flip side, you've known and been good friends with this girl for at least 10 years based on your ages and the fact you were good friends in HS. If a woman you are with has an issue with you even simply hanging out with an old friend like that let along going on a trip, she's got issues you want no part of. \n\nSo, fwiw, I say enjoy the trip but also know you suck too (in this instance, I'm sure you're both generally lovely people,  she just needs to control every aspect of her SOs life, and you don't give 2 shits about her insecurities)", "NTA Go and have a great time. Might be smart to have a separate place to live when you get back if you don\u2019t already.", "ESH except Abbie. \n\nBrittany sounds jealous and controlling - there\u2019s nothing wrong with spending one-on-one time with a friend of the opposite sex, especially if there\u2019s no history there or any legitimate reason for her to be worried about it. I wouldn\u2019t put up with that.\n\nHowever, you agreed to not even hang out with Abbie one-on-one but somehow thought Brittany would be fine with the two of you going on a trip together? If you\u2019ve been planning the trip with Abbie since before you started dating Brittany, how has it never come up before? You should have told her when she mentioned not being comfortable with you and Abbie spending time together alone.", "NTA, as long as you are okay with being single after the trip is over. I would be in your shoes. It sounds like she knew about the trip all along and just assumed you\u2019d change your mind about it. You\u2019re allowed to have friends, including Abbie, and to go on trips without your gf. But your gf can also decide what she is and is not okay with. \n\nChances are this would continue to be an issue with some resentment if you didn\u2019t go. I think you both could be more communicative here, but you two may just not be compatible with this.", "NAH", "YTA.\n\nAnd this is my vote after placing myself both in your GF\u2019s shoes and yourself. I also would like to know, did Abbie just not bring this up to your gf at all? You say they are friends, but how come this trip only got brought up ONE time, only by you? that\u2019s what kind of trips me up, because I would be talking constantly about something like this\u2026 but that\u2019s not the point. \n\nI can see where your GF attitude took into play when you told her about Mexico for the second time. Coming from someone who constantly had a controlling leach on them regarding their friends, trips, anything\u2026 i can see where this puts you in a hard place. You have been friends with Abbie for years and this was a thought out trip before hand and it just kind of puts a harsh on the whole mood because your GF.\n\nBut\u2026\n\nYou only told her about it one time. And it\u2019s not specified if it was before or after the bar thing, but seriously, grown ages and all\u2026. who goes to a bar with a friend and doesn\u2019t text their s/o about where they are at/doing? Finding that out via social media? That\u2019s kinda shitty as hell. Imagine your GF just waiting around for a reply and seeing that you didn\u2019t have time 30mim ago to reply, but you had time 15 minutes ago to snap a pic w Abbie.\n\nThen, imagine you in her shoes. She\u2019s out with a platonic hot dude friend that you are chill with, drinking at a bar for a bit, but now she\u2019s not answering you and you are getting worried because it\u2019s late. Where did your mind go? Oh no worries, you found out she\u2019s not cheating via instagram. (not saying this was the situation, but putting this into a diff perspective for you)\n\nINFO: Is Abbie single? This also may take into consideration to your girlfriends feelings. I mean\u2026 who WOULD feel comfortable with your s/o going to a different country with another male/female, and probably drinking constantly. IDK you OP and i\u2019m sure you are a loyal partner, but this whole situation is just putting everyone between a rock and a hard place, strictly platonic or not. Especially saying she could come, after the fact she got upset. She may have reconsidered the whole thing if you thought about inviting her before bragging about your trip coming up and only inviting her after she got upset.", "I don\u2019t understand. Are you asking whether or not you\u2019re the asshole because you\u2019re prioritizing going to Mexico with Abby over your relationship, or because you don\u2019t care that you\u2019re going to end up single as a result of going? I think you believe that Brittany is bluffing and I\u2019m not sure why that is \u2014 it seems pretty clear this is her line in the sand, so the real question is whether you care enough about her to sacrifice a trip you\u2019ve planned but not booked or paid for yet. \n\nPersonally, several of my best friends are male and I\u2019ve traveled on group trips with them without my boyfriend, so I wanted to take your side, but\u2026 a 1-on-1 international trip to a common couple\u2019s destination is a bit much. I wouldn\u2019t be comfortable with this and would feel similarly disrespected. Fwiw, I don\u2019t think this is controlling, either \u2014 this is a reasonable line to draw. Brittany has told you her boundaries and she\u2019s letting you know what the consequences of crossing them will be (you\u2019ll be single). \n\nAlso, telling your girlfriend that she\u2019s \u201ccrazy\u201d and completely dismissing her concerns/feelings is a sign that you have weak communication skills. This is compounded by the fact that you never resolved the issue the first time it came up when you went out drinking with Abby: instead of fully talking things through with Brittany, you just led her to believe you understood by no longer hanging out with Abby alone. Do you not see how she might have reasonably concluded that the trip was off the table?\n\nThere\u2019s no way you\u2019ve reassured her and, frankly, have probably convinced her that you doth protest too much about the nature of your friendship with Abby. YTA for not listening to your girlfriend\u2019s feelings or talking things through properly. You need to decide whether you care about going to Mexico or having Brittany as a girlfriend more because it\u2019s highly unlikely you\u2019re going to get both.", "NTA, not cool for your gf to dictate to you who you can and can\u2019t hang out with. Also, you going on a trip is humiliating for her how?????\n However, I would strongly encourage you to have a frank conversation about why she feels the way she does, how her remarks make you feel, and how you both can come to a resolution/compromise. Communicate and establish boundaries as best you can. And if you can\u2019t come to a resolution, then you might want to think about if you\u2019re willing to abide this. Without trust, you can\u2019t have a relationship.", "NTA and just break up with her dude. Her jealousy issues are only going to get worse and at some point you're either going to break up anyway or it's going to drive away your friendship with Abby.", "[deleted]", "I mean *I* think YTA, but asking us ain\u2019t really gonna change anything will it? You agreed to no 1-on-1 with a girl, but are now going on a trip to Mexico with a girl? That\u2019s some impressive cognitive dissonance there my guy.\n\nEnjoy your trip, maybe Abbie can help you find a new gf when you get back.", "NTA.  You\u2019ve only been together 7 months.  The trip was planned prior to meeting her with someone you consider your best friend of what I can gather about 10 years.  She knew this going into the relationship that your best friend happens to be female.  This is a pure power play on your soon to be ex\u2019s part.  \nAnd I\u2019m sick and tired of all these jealous new relationships that have such insecurity that you have to give up your best friend because they happen to be a different \u201csex\u201d than you are !!!!\nSure she\u2019s ok with your \u201cfriend\u201d but only when it\u2019s on Britney\u2019s terms.  It\u2019s BS.  Enjoy the trip and when you are ready to date again find someone who trusts you.", "YTA. This is a bad idea. I'd say the same thing Brittany did. I know because I did. No way is my (then bf, now husband) going to another country with some random chicks I don't know for a week long music festival.\n\nHell. No.", "Yep you are 100%\n\nYour gf who you are dating now explicitly explained to you how much it bothers her. Yet you chose to ignore her feelings and go.\n\nNot cool.\n\nShoe on the other foot, how would you feel? Always put yourself in the other person's position.\nEspecially in a relationship.", "YTA if you want to keep this relationship. She gave you a clear boundary and you expect to bulldoze over it and still want her to stay with you. Not wanting your partner to go on an international trip with the opposite sex one on one is a very fair ask. \n\nQuestion: would you be okay with her going on a trip with a man by herself to another country?", "NTA. Though this could be a relationship ender.\n\nHow long have you and Brittany been together?", "NTA. This was planned way in advance. And your girlfriend was invited to join. It seems like your friendship with Abbie is a lot more solid than the relationship with Brittany. I\u2019d choose to lose the \u201ciffy GF\u201d instead of damaging a tried and true friendship.", "YTA\nYou clearly don\u2019t respect your gf or her boundaries. Its common curiosity to tell ur partner about going out with friends (especially friends of the op sex) and IF this trip was planned b4 you met her then this should have been addressed from the get go. Now you can be friends with whoever you want but she has the right to break up with you. At the end of the day, having a gf/bf changes things in your friendships.", "You\u2019re the jerk. Sheesh, why is it not common sense?", "I mean let\u2019s be real, you don\u2019t really like Brittney that much.  If you did, you wouldn\u2019t be so blas\u00e9 about this.  Regardless, I think going on the trip is N T A, but E S H for failing to communicate and Y T A for not making it clear that you were still going on the trip.  Brittney is TA for the ultimatum.  \n\nESH.", "Nta enjoy Mexico !", "NTA and I'm very curious about the folks who insist your TA would react if you were a woman was best friends with a man, or gay or even bi and friends with a man?", "NTA. You are allowed to have friends. Either your GF trusts you or doesn't. That she doesn't want you to every hang out one-on-one with any other woman is seriously controlling. \n\nHave a nice time on your trip.

A lunch.... Sure, a vacation... Whole nother thing. And I bet a lot of these answers would change if it was you!", "NTA\n\nYou've been dating for 7 months.

Bye bye Brittany!", "NTA. I have a male best friend like this that I met in middle school- have never had even the SLIGHTEST sexual or romantic desire towards him\nand vice versa so I totally understand your friendship. However, you should talk with your gf and come up with boundaries that you\u2019re BOTH comfortable with around the friendship/trip (ex you both stay in separate rooms or you bring another friend along with you guys). If she is giving you an ultimatum about the trip or your friendship with Abbie and is not willing to compromise or at least find some kind of mutual agreement I would end it with her. From experience this kind of jealousy/unwillingness to compromise is hard to work around.", "YTA", "YTA\n\nI hopeshe gain sanity, as men with female best friend is a drama she shouldnt insert at. Never date such a man.", "NTA, go on the trip.  If she leaves you, then you dodged a bullet. If she stays then there is still a lot of jealousy/trust issues to work through. It will only get worse as time moves on.", "NTA.\n\nEnjoy your trip - you two planned it before Brittany bullied her way into trying to break up your friendship.\n\nPS - if you want to be petty, ask her how many guy friends she has and whether or not a chaperone is present, because 'then she knows it's wrong to do with a guy out of respect.'", "NTA. To the people who have this dumb argument that you can\u2019t be friends with the opposite sex, what\u2019s your dumb rule for bisexuals then? Can\u2019t be friends with anyone?

We met in high school and have been platonic best friends ever since. We never had an inkling of romance toward each other, and so she's just truly a platonic best friend.\n\nMy girlfriend, whom we can call Brittany (28F) understands this and really likes Abbie, and even considers Abbie a friend of her own. She's only ever had a problem with my friendship with Abbie once, when Abbie and I went to a bar together by ourselves while GF was studying, and I didn't tell her until she saw I posted about it on IG stories. She told me that she didn't want me hanging out with a girl one on one by ourselves, and I told her I don't do that with any other girl except Abbie. My GF said if I'm only doing it with Abbie, then I know it's wrong to do with a girl out of respect, but we didn't really see eye to eye and so we both moved on, and I haven't done it since. \n\nNow here is the issue: before me and Brittany started dating, Abbie and I planned a trip to Mexico by ourselves for spring break. I was talking to Brittany about it and how excited I was to go to Mexico, but Brittany was shocked and asked \"are you still going?\" I said obviously yes, I was, and she kind of gave a scoff. I felt she wanted to be invited, and so I asked if she wanted to go. She said I know she couldn't afford it since she's in law school. She told me that it's disrespectful and humiliating for me to go on a  trip, especially with another girl without her, and if I go on this trip with Abbie without her, I will be single when I get back.\n\nI told her that was crazy and that she's friends with Abbie too and knows that we are strictly platonic, but she doesn't care. I told her that I'm going regardless since I planned this trip before we even knew each other, but she just told me that I can go if I want, she just won't be here when I get back.\n\nAITA for still wanting to go on the trip, even when my girlfriend said no?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Too bad for her, he\u2019s not an idiot and actually stayed loyal to his friend.", "But the gf essentially trying to end a lifelong friendship because she's uncomfortable isn't dishonest or manipulative at all to you?  If two friends can't hang out on a trip that predates a relationship then the relationship is abusive the other way.  And you don't need to answer this but I want you to consider the genders being reversed.  I would be willing to bet you and many others would view OP as the victim much more often.", "First, you\u2019re moving goalposts.  You were originally arguing that he was wrong not to cancel plans with his friend after they agreed to be exclusive.  Now you\u2019re talking about after their argument.\n\nIf OP agreed to follow her terms, then I\u2019d agree that\u2019s lying and not ok.  From what he said, it sounded like the argument was inconclusive and he didn\u2019t agree to avoid spending time alone with her.\n\nI don\u2019t think that binds him to follow that in the future.  Avoiding something because you don\u2019t want to fight about it again is not the same as agreeing to follow a rule you don\u2019t feel comfortable with.\n\nIt\u2019s also clear that OP felt this trip was a separate matter, since it had been planned so long and wasn\u2019t the same kind of hangout that they\u2019d been fighting about.  I see why that makes no difference to the GF, but I can also see why it didn\u2019t occur to OP.  They both knew about the trip, and neither discussed it explicitly with regards to this rule she is trying to impose before this argument.", "He had mentioned the trip to her already. If she had a problem then she could have pointed it out at any time. It's not his job to be Sherlock Holmes that cracks the case of beliefs she isn't communicating.\n\nYou didn't address my question. Why is the onus on him? Why wasn't the onus on her to deem them incompatible when she found out about this?", "You\u2019re right.  It must have been after I checked his comments.", "This whole situation should have been properly discussed and not just \u201cmoved on from\u201d as he \u201chadn\u2019t done it since\u201d knowing she would be upset. clearly knowing she felt uncomfortable with him going to a bar one on one he should have brought this up sooner as a real discussion instead of going \u201coh wow I\u2019m so excited\u201d. she\u2019s not controlling for having a boundary, everyone has a different boundary, she\u2019s not saying they can\u2019t be friends.", "You are making incorrect assumptions about me.\n\nI\u2019m a woman. I spend alone time with male friends. When I have had boyfriends express discomfort, I have been crystal clear that I would continue doing so, and I continued doing so.\n\nAnything less would be dishonest on my part, just as it was on OPs part. Incompatibility is a reason to end relationships, not drag them out.\n\nThe vast majority of people would not date someone who takes vacations alone with the opposite sex. That\u2019s not abusive, dishonest, or manipulative. They just need to be with people who are compatible. People like OP are the ones wasting everyone\u2019s time in the meantime.", "I\u2019m not moving goalposts.\n\nWhen OP was single, he made plans as a single man.\n\nAs he got into a relationship, he had a responsibility to communicate about what he was going to continue doing or stop doing.\n\nThey had a discussion about exclusivity, he stopped dating other people.\n\nThey had a discussion about seeing opposite-sex friends alone\u2026 but he hid his intentions because he didn\u2019t want to fight and *didn\u2019t want to break up.*\n\nHe\u2019s cowardly and manipulative.\n\n> OP felt this trip was a separate matter, since it \n\n> wasn\u2019t the same kind of hangout that they\u2019d been fighting above\n\nMaybe stupid too.", "She DID communicate her beliefs: It\u2019s wrong to hang out alone with other women *when you\u2019re in a relationship.*\n\nShe thought he stopped hanging out with women alone, *because he stopped hanging out with other women alone.*\n\nOnly he knew he didn\u2019t intend to stop! Only he knew they weren\u2019t incompatible!", "She knew about the trip, she never brought it up, she assumed she was in control and when she realized she wasn\u2019t, she acted more upset again and gave a childish ultimatum. He definitely dodged a bullet here. This kinda woman wasn\u2019t worth his time.", "How was he wasting anyone's time?  Because he assumes the trip his GF knew about with the friend the GF knew about that he presumably already paid for was going to happen?  I think you prove my point in just suggesting a guy having a female friend can't be in a relationship.", "I think you\u2019re a bit too quick to jump on a crazy controlling girlfriend train it\u2019s kind of sad actually. Yeah he dodged a bullet, he dodged having healthy conversations couples need to have to build a relationship. This kind of women might be slightly insecure or have a bit of anxiety, nothing that with proper discussions can\u2019t help. she\u2019s allowed to have BOUNDARIES. Are you in a relationship?", "Yeah no. \n\nI have medically diagnosed anxiety and it's on me to manage it. It's good to ask for help, but theres asking for help and there's expecting other people to manage it. \n\nIt's on her to bring up themes that upset her. If she isn't able to do that... Maybe work on that before getting into a relationship and expect the other dude to do her will."]}
