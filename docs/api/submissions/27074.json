Did your wife know that he was naked? Shutting the door quickly (aka slamming the door) is an appropriate response to someone - especially of the other gender - approaching the room you\u2019re in when you\u2019re naked. I think it\u2019s odd your son wants to play hangman with his dad while naked, too, honestly.", "NTA\n\n>She apologized to Alden and a few hours later she told me she didn't mean the apology and it was not a hill worth dying on.\n\nYour wife is a piece of work, and I feel terrible for your son if this is how little she respects his dignity and privacy, and the fact that he is no longer her baby boy, but a young man entering the early days of adolescence. \n\nPuberty starts so young these days, and I don't just mean that \"kids are growing up earlier\"; I mean that scientifically speaking, actual puberty is kicking in far younger than it did even 20 or 30 years ago. For many of us, it's easy to forget that a 10-year-old is experiencing a lot of the feelings and physical changes that their parents didn't necessarily go through until they were several years older. So normally I'd give your wife some grace. But she can't even do the same thing for her own child?\n\nHe didn't slam the door in her face to be rude. He did it in the heat of the moment out of embarrassment! He's a tween-aged kid whose mom was about to see him naked. He may even have a few pubic hairs already, and even if he doesn't, he's definitely already developing an adolescent self-consciousness. Her blithely walking in on his bathtime like he's her Wittle Baby Boy was GENUINELY thoughtless, and she really did owe him an apology. Several of my closest friends have sons his age, and those moms stand outside the bathroom when their sons shower these days. They may prompt, \"Did you rinse your hair well?\" or \"Did you wash under your arms? We had a talk about that!\" and some of their sons are even okay with being seen naked IF MOM ASKS FIRST. But they absolutely do not take that for granted. They want their sons to understand consent and privacy as much as their daughters, and so they practice what they preach.\n\nYour wife saying that she only apologized because \"it wasn't a hill worth dying on\" shows real contempt for Alden. As a husband and father, you're right to be bothered by that. It doesn't say great things about her character. You are NTA at all.", "NTA. Sounds like it was a moment of embarrassment for your son, and he didn't know how to react. 10 is definitely old enough though where neither you or your wife should assume it's okay to pop into the bathroom while he's in there. \n\nIt's a teachable moment all around. You can teach your son it's more than okay to have boundaries and privacy, but there are assertive yet respectful ways to communicate it. \n\nFor your wife, it's a lesson that her kiddo is growing up and is going to want privacy and that she will need to not only help him navigate that, but also learn to respect it. \n\nI'm guessing her pride or ego was a little hurt that she wasn't the parent that he wanted, and that's valid, but to get mad at him for setting a boundary, that's just poor modeling. She should come from a place of \"im sorry if I made you feel embarrassed, next time if you don't want me to come in, just say so and I will also make sure I knock\"", "Y\u2019all both weird for that.", "ESH. Your wife didn\u2019t need to punish him for that. But remind him that slamming the door in someone\u2019s face is rude. However, it\u2019s weird that he is so comfortable chilling naked around grown males. I get your his dad, but she is his\nMom. He maybe shouldn\u2019t be requesting a parent to watch him bath if he isn\u2019t comfortable with both parents. Mom was just trying to be accommodating to his request to play. Maybe teaching him the normal boundary of bathing alone or being private while naked with both genders is a necessity here.", "Nta", "[deleted]", "NTA. Something similar happened to me when I was younger and I got slapped in the face like seven times because I shouted at my dad to close the door when he came in by accident instead of asking politely. SMH \ud83d\ude44", "NTA", "Nta. These miscommunications happen and it should be relayed by you not to slam doors in moms face. But idk why she felt it necessary to say she didn't mean the apology. That's the ah behavior for me. She was simply apologizing for over responding to that moment. And he should if he hadn't apologize for slaming the door in her face.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

He is always right to decide he doesn't want his mom in there,  but slamming wasn't needed here, which he didn't understand in that moment. Now if he had said it made him uncomfortable and mom tried to barge herself in. Then yeah I'd say go for it and slam away.", "Shutting the door quickly because you don't want to be seen naked is incredibly appropriate. The fact that she is taking it personally is narcissistic. You shouldn't have to stand there naked in front of your mom explaining why you deserve privacy."]}
