Did your wife know that he was naked? Shutting the door quickly (aka slamming the door) is an appropriate response to someone - especially of the other gender - approaching the room you\u2019re in when you\u2019re naked. I think it\u2019s odd your son wants to play hangman with his dad while naked, too, honestly.", "NTA\n\n>She apologized to Alden and a few hours later she told me she didn't mean the apology and it was not a hill worth dying on.\n\nYour wife is a piece of work, and I feel terrible for your son if this is how little she respects his dignity and privacy, and the fact that he is no longer her baby boy, but a young man entering the early days of adolescence. \n\nPuberty starts so young these days, and I don't just mean that \"kids are growing up earlier\"; I mean that scientifically speaking, actual puberty is kicking in far younger than it did even 20 or 30 years ago. For many of us, it's easy to forget that a 10-year-old is experiencing a lot of the feelings and physical changes that their parents didn't necessarily go through until they were several years older. So normally I'd give your wife some grace. But she can't even do the same thing for her own child?\n\nHe didn't slam the door in her face to be rude. He did it in the heat of the moment out of embarrassment! He's a tween-aged kid whose mom was about to see him naked. He may even have a few pubic hairs already, and even if he doesn't, he's definitely already developing an adolescent self-consciousness. Her blithely walking in on his bathtime like he's her Wittle Baby Boy was GENUINELY thoughtless, and she really did owe him an apology. Several of my closest friends have sons his age, and those moms stand outside the bathroom when their sons shower these days. They may prompt, \"Did you rinse your hair well?\" or \"Did you wash under your arms? We had a talk about that!\" and some of their sons are even okay with being seen naked IF MOM ASKS FIRST. But they absolutely do not take that for granted. They want their sons to understand consent and privacy as much as their daughters, and so they practice what they preach.\n\nYour wife saying that she only apologized because \"it wasn't a hill worth dying on\" shows real contempt for Alden. As a husband and father, you're right to be bothered by that. It doesn't say great things about her character. You are NTA at all.", "NTA. Sounds like it was a moment of embarrassment for your son, and he didn't know how to react. 10 is definitely old enough though where neither you or your wife should assume it's okay to pop into the bathroom while he's in there. \n\nIt's a teachable moment all around. You can teach your son it's more than okay to have boundaries and privacy, but there are assertive yet respectful ways to communicate it. \n\nFor your wife, it's a lesson that her kiddo is growing up and is going to want privacy and that she will need to not only help him navigate that, but also learn to respect it. \n\nI'm guessing her pride or ego was a little hurt that she wasn't the parent that he wanted, and that's valid, but to get mad at him for setting a boundary, that's just poor modeling. She should come from a place of \"im sorry if I made you feel embarrassed, next time if you don't want me to come in, just say so and I will also make sure I knock\"", "Y\u2019all both weird for that.", "ESH. Your wife didn\u2019t need to punish him for that. But remind him that slamming the door in someone\u2019s face is rude. However, it\u2019s weird that he is so comfortable chilling naked around grown males. I get your his dad, but she is his\nMom. He maybe shouldn\u2019t be requesting a parent to watch him bath if he isn\u2019t comfortable with both parents. Mom was just trying to be accommodating to his request to play. Maybe teaching him the normal boundary of bathing alone or being private while naked with both genders is a necessity here.", "Nta", "[deleted]", "NTA.

Which if thats the case it sounds as if he heard her coming towards that bathroom and instead of saying hey mom, I meant I only wanted dad he slammed the door.  He is 10 and knows how to use his words.  Just because he has crazy hormones going on doesn't mean he gets to take it out on his mom.

Of course Mom came in without thinking of it. 10 year old boys slip and fall all the time, or at least maybe clog the toilet. He needed a parent. There is no contempt here.

Or maybe he wasn\u2019t aware of just how THOROUGHLY uncomfortable he is now with the idea of his mom seeing him naked, as opposed to before when it might\u2019ve been just a little bit awkward/embarrassing. Remember that 10 year olds are still learning about personal hygiene, and it\u2019s not that long ago that their parents helped them in the bath or the bathroom or when getting dressed etc etc", "He's 10, why the door wasn't shut isn't really relevant.", "ESH. This was clearly a misunderstanding, and your wife needs to get a grip and stop punishing the kid. You seem overtly contemptuous of your wife and are placing all of the onus on her to be psychic and have magically known that your child wanted you, and only you, when he called out for a generic anyone to come and play hangman with him (particularly if, not so long ago, he would have been happy with his mother filling that role). \n\nSince you've taken over bath duties from your wife, which is fine, you need to teach Alden that if he wants privacy, he should close the bathroom door, which will be a universal signal to anyone, wife included, to knock, even if he's calling because he needs something. If I heard my kid calling for a parent from the bathroom and arrived to find the bathroom door wide open, I wouldn't think much of sticking my head inside or whatever, either. Does it make sense why Alden slammed the door on her? Sure. But going forward, close the bathroom door if you want privacy. Simple.\n\nYou could probably do with demonstrating a modicum of understanding for your wife, who's probably adjusting to the fact that her little boy is growing up, and he's pulling away from her and gravitating towards you (assuming the two of them had a close relationship before). The way she's handling it isn't the greatest, but you kind of seem like you're gloating about your recent, increased closeness with your son and ignoring both the steps he could have taken to ensure his own privacy (and it's important he know how to do that!) and why your wife may have difficult/conflicted feelings that she's not doing a great job of working through.", "Sorry and I can already hear the comments..

She's overreacting with the punishment but she also had no way of knowing that Alden only wanted you, plus the door was open to begin with - so between the door slamming and the rejection I can see why she felt hurt.

I understand why she thought her presence was requested, and I understand why he was startled.   \n\n\nLet\u2019s say the door was slammed in anger rather than a momentary panic.

But you do kinda need to chill on your expectations. The tween age is weird for everyone involved. No one is TA about the knocking. Mom is used to him being her baby/ young child, she doesn\u2019t necessarily realize that he had now entered the next phase where he may want privacy. So she just hasn\u2019t gotten used to him wanting that now.\n  \nI understand your reasoning as well. It\u2019s obvious to *you* what your son would have wanted. It wasn\u2019t to your wife. That\u2019s not anyone\u2019s fault, just a lack of realization on both your parts. \n\nYour son is only 10 so his inability to perfectly communicate exactly what he wanted is no one\u2019s fault either. He may not even know what he wants. And it may change from day to day and minute to minute. He\u2019s getting older and starting to get the feeling of needing privacy so yeah, he had every right to slam the door. He\u2019s stuck in that world between being a child and being a teenager. Lots of changing grey areas as to what he will want over the next few years.\n\nNone of the punishment or arguments that transpired after the door slam needed to happen. Imagine this instead:\n-Son calls out from bath\n-Mom responds not realizing he exclusively wants dad, and attempts to enter \n-Son responds as almost anyone would to an unwanted intruder \n-Mom is injured, but obviously not badly\n-Her first reaction should have been \u201cOops! Sorry,\u201d\n\nAt this point she could have communicated with her son to find out why this transpired, received the totally acceptable answer, and gone to get you.\nOR\nShe could have gone directly to you at which point I assume you would have understood what was happening and explained why your son did what he did\n\n-You go care for your son, explain how he hurt mom even though you know he didn\u2019t mean to\n-Tell him when he gets out, you\u2019ll all have a talk\n-Ask him to apologize to mom for hurting her, even on accident \n-Get him out of the bath and dressed\n-The 3 of you sit down together and have your son try his best to explain where he feels his boundaries are\n-Assure him you *both* will do the best to respect those while also keeping him safe and healthy \nTHE END\n\nSo no one needs to be punished. Wife should *defiantly* apologize even if she thinks she\u2019s correct. The right to decide who can and cannot view your nude body belongs to to the individual.

It\u2019s extremely common. I\u2019d advise a short term parenting class or early childhood education class. Some of them are only like 6 meetings and you\u2019ll both learn a lot. Even if she attends alone, your son\u2019s behavior will make more sense to her. \n\nI truly hope you can communicate instead of punishing and guilting.\n\nAll that said\u2026.. Anyone claiming that playing a game with your dad, as a child, in a tub is always creepy and wrong, I feel sorry for you. You truly believe that every man wants to abuse his child? That\u2019s sick. Did no one here have an normal, kind, awesome dad? Even if you didn\u2019t have a great dad yourself, are you so jaded you can\u2019t believe a father can have a normal healthy relationship with his children? \n\nOP. Don\u2019t let anyone judge you for engaging in innocent play with your own kid. Especially when he will *only* accept you.\n\nGood Luck.", "Not really. I mean, she thought he called for someone to come in and play with him so she went in\u2026as requested. She didn\u2019t do anything wrong. What was the apology for? Do you mean the punishment she inflicted afterward? Was excessive and unwarranted yes. Did you ask what she was so angry about? Shutting the door quickly seems like a normal reaction, is there more to it that you\u2019re not understanding at this point?", "You're just refusing to actually read the post.

Not for an emergency.\n\n> It's also not like the son used his words to have a conversation about wanting more privacy, either. \n\nNo, he's too young not to be embarrassed by doing that. \n\nGeesh, what is it with mothers in particular that they refuse to realize that their \"babies\" are growing up and what that means in terms of changing social relationship?\n\nIt's always the whole \"I diapered you. I know what you look like.\" No, you *knew* years ago. And a baby doesn't care about who sees them naked.", "\u201cHe didn\u2019t want her to see him in all his glory.\u201d\n\nI take that as son being naked?", "It\u2019s just common sense to demonstrate the same respect for privacy that (a) you want your kids to give others and (b) you want them to expect as normal behavior by other adults they encounter.", "It should have been just as normal for the mom to come in. She gave birth to him, for heaven\u2019s sake.", "I remember my parent standing right outside the door when I bathed. I remember nearly killing myself by dumping wooden furniture onto myself. Safety is a thing for kids at all times.\n\nI read the post. I still don't understand where the boy was standing, what he was doing, and why he would call for his dad without a towel while he was standing up next to the door to slam it. That's not in the post. Also the son using any words at all was not in the post, so, there's that.", "That's what OP says, OP was outside and not in the home. He doesn't know exactly what the kid shouted first. I don't even know if the kid was in the bath or what. You would think a bathing child would want bubbles.", "I agree there has to be changes when a kid is 12, or when they transition to showers instead of baths with bath markers. On the other hand, a boy of 10 is still more than likely going to risk killing themselves so they need close supervision. My boyfriend at 12 would repeatedly get on top of his roof! But by then at least he knew what he was doing most of the time, and he had older brothers not just mom to look out.", "son is upstairs with the door open naked. son yells, mom goes upstairs and he realizes its his mom thats goinf to see him naked. then he slams the door to prevent her from possibly seeing more", "He's old enough to decide who he is and isn't comfortable being naked around.", "Jesus christ, where are you getting all this, that he was standing up, with no towel? Does it not occur to you that he was sitting in the bath tub and can just reach the door from the tub?\n\n> My wife called Alden what he wanted. He said he wanted to play hangman with bathtub markers.\n\nLiterally in the OP. You are absolutely, intentionally misreading the whole thing.", "So you are passing a judgement after assuming that ops story is a lie then?\n\nThat kind of defeats the purpose of this sub... though I guess it supports the overall purpose of Reddit.", "I mean, he's 10, so no that didn't occur to me? There would be bath bubbles, and my arms were like 2 foot long when I was 10? Maybe I would know if I saw the bathroom, but again, not too much information as an outsider.", "It's incomplete. He says the wife got confused, he didn't say how he came to that conclusion or in what order that happen. I'm sure OO believes that, but he's missing a lot of information because he's the one person who wasn't there.", "> My wife called Alden what he wanted. He said he wanted to play hangman with bathtub markers. My wife misunderstood that he wanted to play hangman when he wanted to play hangman with me, not anyone else. \n\n> My wife was angry and she was taking away all of his electronics for a week. When I came inside and my wife related this to me, I told her she was wrong.\n\nOr maybe because **she told him what happened**????"]}
