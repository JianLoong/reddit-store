Did your wife know that he was naked? Shutting the door quickly (aka slamming the door) is an appropriate response to someone - especially of the other gender - approaching the room you\u2019re in when you\u2019re naked. I think it\u2019s odd your son wants to play hangman with his dad while naked, too, honestly.", "NTA\n\n>She apologized to Alden and a few hours later she told me she didn't mean the apology and it was not a hill worth dying on.\n\nYour wife is a piece of work, and I feel terrible for your son if this is how little she respects his dignity and privacy, and the fact that he is no longer her baby boy, but a young man entering the early days of adolescence. \n\nPuberty starts so young these days, and I don't just mean that \"kids are growing up earlier\"; I mean that scientifically speaking, actual puberty is kicking in far younger than it did even 20 or 30 years ago. For many of us, it's easy to forget that a 10-year-old is experiencing a lot of the feelings and physical changes that their parents didn't necessarily go through until they were several years older. So normally I'd give your wife some grace. But she can't even do the same thing for her own child?\n\nHe didn't slam the door in her face to be rude. He did it in the heat of the moment out of embarrassment! He's a tween-aged kid whose mom was about to see him naked. He may even have a few pubic hairs already, and even if he doesn't, he's definitely already developing an adolescent self-consciousness. Her blithely walking in on his bathtime like he's her Wittle Baby Boy was GENUINELY thoughtless, and she really did owe him an apology. Several of my closest friends have sons his age, and those moms stand outside the bathroom when their sons shower these days. They may prompt, \"Did you rinse your hair well?\" or \"Did you wash under your arms? We had a talk about that!\" and some of their sons are even okay with being seen naked IF MOM ASKS FIRST. But they absolutely do not take that for granted. They want their sons to understand consent and privacy as much as their daughters, and so they practice what they preach.\n\nYour wife saying that she only apologized because \"it wasn't a hill worth dying on\" shows real contempt for Alden. As a husband and father, you're right to be bothered by that. It doesn't say great things about her character. You are NTA at all.", "NTA. Sounds like it was a moment of embarrassment for your son, and he didn't know how to react. 10 is definitely old enough though where neither you or your wife should assume it's okay to pop into the bathroom while he's in there. \n\nIt's a teachable moment all around. You can teach your son it's more than okay to have boundaries and privacy, but there are assertive yet respectful ways to communicate it. \n\nFor your wife, it's a lesson that her kiddo is growing up and is going to want privacy and that she will need to not only help him navigate that, but also learn to respect it. \n\nI'm guessing her pride or ego was a little hurt that she wasn't the parent that he wanted, and that's valid, but to get mad at him for setting a boundary, that's just poor modeling. She should come from a place of \"im sorry if I made you feel embarrassed, next time if you don't want me to come in, just say so and I will also make sure I knock\"", "Y\u2019all both weird for that.", "ESH. Your wife didn\u2019t need to punish him for that. But remind him that slamming the door in someone\u2019s face is rude. However, it\u2019s weird that he is so comfortable chilling naked around grown males. I get your his dad, but she is his\nMom. He maybe shouldn\u2019t be requesting a parent to watch him bath if he isn\u2019t comfortable with both parents. Mom was just trying to be accommodating to his request to play. Maybe teaching him the normal boundary of bathing alone or being private while naked with both genders is a necessity here.", "Nta", "[deleted]", "NTA. Something similar happened to me when I was younger and I got slapped in the face like seven times because I shouted at my dad to close the door when he came in by accident instead of asking politely. SMH \ud83d\ude44", "NTA", "Nta. These miscommunications happen and it should be relayed by you not to slam doors in moms face. But idk why she felt it necessary to say she didn't mean the apology. That's the ah behavior for me. She was simply apologizing for over responding to that moment. And he should if he hadn't apologize for slaming the door in her face.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Also it's just a game.", "This.  Every word of this.", "He asks me to when he takes a bath so we can talk.", "Would you be okay with \"he closed the door quickly in response to her unexpected & unwelcome entry\"", "Slamming the door on someone walking in on you in the bathroom is ALWAYS appropriate.", "Not sure if I'll do it when he's 10, but my 8 yo boy still likes me to do that.  I'm his father, it's not awkward at all.", "It's a ten year old child with his mother. He is always right to decide he doesn't want his mom in there,  but slamming wasn't needed here, which he didn't understand in that moment. Now if he had said it made him uncomfortable and mom tried to barge herself in. Then yeah I'd say go for it and slam away.", "Shutting the door quickly because you don't want to be seen naked is incredibly appropriate. The fact that she is taking it personally is narcissistic. You shouldn't have to stand there naked in front of your mom explaining why you deserve privacy.", "No electronics for a week, for\u2026not wanting to be seen naked? At ten? She\u2019s definitely the AH in this case.", "NTA\n\nTell your wife that it's time she learned to knock and wait for permission to open a door. Children are entitled to their privacy too.", "The thing that is jumping out to me is... did your wife and son have a super close relationship before?  Because if thats the case, and now because his body is changing, she might be having whip lash of him wanting her and then shutting her out.  You said she got confused of him wanting to play hangman with ANYONE to him really only wanting to play it with you.  Which if thats the case it sounds as if he heard her coming towards that bathroom and instead of saying hey mom, I meant I only wanted dad he slammed the door.  He is 10 and knows how to use his words.  Just because he has crazy hormones going on doesn't mean he gets to take it out on his mom.  You might want to check in (with them both) to see if this is a recurring type of thing... you don't see it as a big deal because its not happening to you.  N t a if its a one off...", "So Alden called out that he wanted to play Hangman with bathtub markers, your wife answered because you were unavailable (and didn't realize he meant you), and Alden slammed the door in her face because he didn't want her to see him naked. Is that the basic series of events?\n\nI don't see how your wife could've known that he meant you if he didn't specify, and I understand why Alden would want his privacy. The open door while bathing thing is a bit weird to me but you guys obviously have your own deal. I agree that it isn't the hill to die in but understand why your wife would be perplexed if she had no way of knowing that Alden did not, in fact, need whatever parent was available. NAH.", "NTA. The second my son started not wanting me to see him naked, I made an effort to give him that privacy. She should have meant the apology, because children are humans who are entitled to privacy, even from their parents.", "NTA- this is a problem that could've been avoided by the simple common courtesy of knocking. If she knocked he would have said actually I really just want Dad. If she knocked, there would be no need to slam the door. \n\nHe's getting older. It's time to start knocking and saying she's coming in instead of barging in.", "NTA. You teach kids about respect by showing it to them, and about boundaries and bodily autonomy by respecting theirs.", "NTA. I\u2019m never going to understand how a parent of a child can be this emotionally immature. Especially with dealing with your own child! Your wife is being wildly unreasonable", "NTA. I'd give your wife a few days to work through her feelings before you two discuss this again. \n\nIf I had to guess, she's having a hard time adjusting to your son not needing and/or wanting her as much as he used to when he was little. And while those struggles and emotions are hers to process as her partner I would suggest a little love and empathy. \n\nBut also, she should not be taking it out on your son and  kudos to you for advocating for him.", "NTA - Parent or not, that is a completely appropriate response to someone walking in on you naked. Wife needs to understand privacy.", "NTA. I just hope you lifted the grounding because kid did nothing wrong.", "NTA. She is. She knows she is wrong and she doesn't want to admit it. She probably thinks she cam bully you into dropping it. Do not give in.", "Your wife doesn\u2019t understand that your son is getting body conscious, and that she should be teaching him that he, and no one else but he, gets to be in charge of who sees his body? She\u2019s seriously going to increase his risks by making him think adults get to see him naked whether he wants them to or not?  She may tell herself that she\u2019s different because she\u2019s his mother, but her thinking isn\u2019t right.", "No. You are not. It\u2019s a boy. Lol.", "You're NTA and your wife doesn't get it. Perhaps you can get her a book on puberty; she needs to get ready, worse is yet to come.", "He is only 10. He's kind of in-between a kid and a teenager (I guess they call this a tween, haha). He could be past the stage of being comfortable being naked in front of Mom but still enjoy playing in the bath occasionally. \n\nMy kid has always been kind of \"young\" for his age and I could totally picture him doing this at 10.", "Umm am I misreading the post, or was OP not even home yet when the boy called for a parent? Of course Mom came in without thinking of it. 10 year old boys slip and fall all the time, or at least maybe clog the toilet. He needed a parent. There is no contempt here. She's being a parent of someone who is, yes, still a little boy. He is playing hangman with bath markers FFS. And he didn't reach for a towel or anything.", "A young child called for a parent. End the privacy at that point, kids need safety and support. It's also not like the son used his words to have a conversation about wanting more privacy, either. Or like he could remember to keep a door shut.", "Its completely reasonable for a person of any age to react by quickly slamming a bathroom door when someone is approaching and you are naked.", ">He maybe shouldn\u2019t be requesting a parent to watch him bath if he isn\u2019t comfortable with both parents.\n\nNah, what is this nonsense.\n\nSo, he should actively avoid doing something with his dad in the name of equity?\n\nHow far do you take this? Should a 14 year old girl who isn't comfortable discussing the details of her period problems with her father suffer in silence? I mean, it would be so unfair on dad if she went to her mum.\n\nOh no, it wouldn't.\n\nSeriously, in what reality is it weird for a child to be more comfortable naked around same sex people. Especially when that child is nearing puberty.", "It wasn\u2019t a rude response, it was a *panicked* response, from a naked kid who wasn\u2019t expecting his mother to barge in on him in the bathroom.", "Its not rude to slam a door to stop someone from seeing you naked,  even if it's your mom. Its not weird that a 10 yr old is comfortable being naked in front of his father.", "Please don't pay any attention to the ludicrous questioning of you playing hangman with your son while he's naked in the bath. There is absolutely nothing wrong with that at all and anyone who goes there reveals so much more about them than your healthy relationship with your son!", "why is this guy getting downvoted (no genuinely someone explain i dont understand)", "OP, you weren't home. Her son called for a parent. Why in the world would she had thought to knock?! He had called for her. She changed his diapers for a long time not so long ago, mind you. Also, if he couldn't cover up, he would most likely have been hurt. 10 year old boys get silly injuries all of the time. 10 is not 16, or even 14.\n\nI'm amazed he could reach the door easier than he could a towel or something.", "You are misreading the post, dad WAS gone he was just outside cleaning out his car", "But also why would you have the bathroom door open if you are in there getting a shower/bath etc.  Don't know about other people but if I'm in a place, with a person that I'm uncomfortable being naked in front of, when I go to get a shower, I shut the door first.  If I call out for something, I open it a crack ask for it and shut it gently again...", "No, it's really not with family. You pull your pants up or grab a towel or sink underneath the bath bubbles or something. Of course, with that said, I'm female. My father stopped coming into the bathroom with me when I was like maybe as young as 4? He was very cautious, he had the support from my mom to be that way, and I don't blame him. But if OP was not home (he says something happened after he came home?) of course mom came running... that's what parents do for 10 year olds who can get in all manner of trouble...", "Because freaking Reddit can be ridiculous!!! X", "But you\u2019re probably an adult, or at least older than 10. Maybe, because this is an established routine with his dad, he didn\u2019t even consider the idea that leaving the door open might cause his mom to wander in by accident, since it hadn\u2019t happened before. Or maybe he wasn\u2019t aware of just how THOROUGHLY uncomfortable he is now with the idea of his mom seeing him naked, as opposed to before when it might\u2019ve been just a little bit awkward/embarrassing. Remember that 10 year olds are still learning about personal hygiene, and it\u2019s not that long ago that their parents helped them in the bath or the bathroom or when getting dressed etc etc", "He's 10, why the door wasn't shut isn't really relevant."]}
