I hate taking pictures..It's not even that I feel ugly or insecure..on the contrary I love the way I look in the mirror but pictures always feel staged and forced or when taken randomly, intrusive. It's honestly creepy if someone is sneaking pictures of you. Tell her your boundaries again and tell her she can obliged your boundaries or she can find a new BF. Because you do not want to stay in a relationship with someone who casually violates your boundaries for their own entertainment.", "NTA, but I get why she does it. My boyfriend does the most random cute faces or gestures and he might not even notice it but I love to keep those moments for myself. I wont share them with anyone but I do take the picture.
