Your coworker is being overly sensitive and insane. There is no reason to approach every conversation or question in the adversarial way that she did here. And the accusation of you being racist, based entirely on what you have typed here, is insulting to people who actually experience racism.

So there's something weird about the way she reacted.  \nMaybe it's in relation with the recent geopolitics? In that case, it's sad because she is certainly persuaded that she can never speak about her native country.  \nI wouldn't like to be in her place, I'd become paranoid and stop to approach people for fear they get curious too. Which would only be natural...  \nI was tempted to consider your 'joke' excessive, but she was the one who acted offended when you literally had done nothing wrong.   \nIf she is already avoiding people who want to know her, I fear she isn't going to like her new country very much...", "NTA", "NTA \n\nNothing rude about it.", "NTA\n\nIt's not racist, it's just where they are born, has nothing to do with skin tone.

They were just using you as a stand-in for the US government so they could vent their spleen at you until they got tired of it.

Long gone are the days you casually discussed with your classmates what percentage of German you were, how much Cherokee, etcetera. The PC police will get you now.", "Because if he didn't know she was an immigrant and just assumed she was an immigrant based on looks that is a form of racism. It makes a lot of minorities uncomfortable.", "She's the asshole for calling him racist when he asked a normal question. Calling everything racist when it's not is a big problem.", "If he did that after her first response, I'd say he's in the clear. But he pushed it and didn't apologize is why I think he is.", "Honestly don\u2019t apologize. Just flag the person as dramatic and move on.", "Why are they the asshole, they don't OWE you anything. Especially not an answer to a question they find uncomfortable.", "But he already knew she just moved to US. It's stated in the post. She works with his friend at the same company.", "Why do you think there was no racism involved? Because something made him think that she has to answer him. Why else should he ignore her boundary?\n\nAnd him being intrusive is way worse then her usage of the word racism. Especially if she is used to such reactions.", "Even after pushing once I don\u2019t see his actions as intentionally malicious. That doesn\u2019t require an apology. He may have been unintentionally obtuse, but that isn\u2019t a reason I\u2019d apologize for.", "It was not a mistake. It was a normal question. Not answering it and then making racism accusations is weird and was really the mistake in the conversation.\n\nOp is NTA", "If you got out of the story that she has to tell him where she's from no matter what that's your problem. Seems like you automatically assumed he's racist just because he's American. He simply asked and she said she can't answer that question. That makes no sense. Can't not won't. Obviously that's going to get a joke reply like he gave.", "If you can't apologize for pushing it or for the misunderstanding, then you're an AH. SIMPLE.", "Don't you live in America?", "You don't have to agree with me and I don't have to continue speaking with you.    Lucky for both of us!", "You're NTA simply for being curious. YTA for thinking you have the right to pry into someone else's business just because they're being \"weird\".", "Choosing not to give information about yourself to a stranger in a social setting isn't a mistake; it's a boundary.    And choosing not to respect a social boundary just because you're curious is asshole behavior."]}
