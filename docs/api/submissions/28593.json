Your coworker is being overly sensitive and insane. There is no reason to approach every conversation or question in the adversarial way that she did here.

So there's something weird about the way she reacted.  \nMaybe it's in relation with the recent geopolitics? In that case, it's sad because she is certainly persuaded that she can never speak about her native country.  \nI wouldn't like to be in her place, I'd become paranoid and stop to approach people for fear they get curious too. Which would only be natural...  \nI was tempted to consider your 'joke' excessive, but she was the one who acted offended when you literally had done nothing wrong.   \nIf she is already avoiding people who want to know her, I fear she isn't going to like her new country very much...", "NTA", "NTA \n\nNothing rude about it.", "NTA\n\nIt's not racist, it's just where they are born, has nothing to do with skin tone.

OP then questioned her refusal, made fun of her for it, and told her she was \"being ridiculous\" by being offended by the tone and direction of the conversation.     That is not a \"single question, asked once.\"    and you know that as well as I do.", "Okay? You said I wouldn't know, so I gave you context of why I would in fact know. I never claimed to speak for all immigrants.\n\nBut \"not speaking for all immigrants\" still doesn't make it racist or an interrogation.\n\n\"I don't feel comfortable talking about that at work\" is the appropriate response to such a mundane question. If they keep digging, then yes, it's appropriate to escalate to HR", "I wasn't talking to OP either.  I was addressing *your* comment about a \"faux-pas\" that was not actually a faux-pas.", "  I'm not actually making a judgement, I am recounting a repeated experience. 100% of the people who have ever said to me that you \"...can't say anything anymore,\" have been bemoaning their own plight, not showing interest in anyone else's perspective.    People interested in learning ask questions, and they don't get butthurt by being told that something they've said is offensive.\n\nIf *you* are someone who's willing to ask respectful questions, be quiet and learn, then do *that*.

If you'd said *that* first, I'd have answered far differently.", "Like from the local population, too big of a melting pot to give one iota of a fuck about someone just being from another specific country. Makes it incredibly weird to not be willing to answer. I could understand in a country with historic or current tensions with a specific country.", "Eh whatever, don't be super fucking weird and no one will get curious when you super weirdly refuse to answer a basic normal question. You're entitled to your privacy, but imo y'all are a little (re: off the fucking charts like every thread from you wierdos) ridiculous like that entitles you to not even have to field a mild follow-up.", "If you have ridiculous and weird boundaries that come up out of nowhere it's perfectly normal to receive a basic follow-up.

I'm not trying to change your mind, or tell you that you're wrong. I just don't agree with you.", "Good point. I wonder if their 'mutual friend' actually never asked, was quicker about backing off when shut down, or how that went?", "Sorry im not used to talking to people i dont like i usually just show it or walk away, maybe i have a privileged life around higher class people where youre not compelled to give your personal info to randos", "[deleted]", "It probably came up naturally in conversation rather than just \"hey where are you from?\" Out of the blue.", "So you're just rude and have enough money that you're either throwing your weight around at work or otherwise aren't afraid of being fired for your complete lack of basic decency.\n\nIf you think everyone you don't like is a worse person than you, your worldview is skewed.\n\n\"I prefer not to talk about that\" is an appropriate response.
