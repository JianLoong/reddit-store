He makes dinner for the family 2-3x a week because he enjoys it and it gives him an opportunity to try new recipes. I generally cook the rest of the time, unless it\u2019s summer and my husband insists on grilling every day. \n\nJames was not particularly interested in learning to cook. I did try to teach him the kitchen basics and he can make himself a sandwich and simple things but he\u2019d rather grab an apple than make himself a meal.\n\nA few months back, James began asking Adam in the afternoons to make him a snack (something homemade) and sometimes he\u2019ll do it if he\u2019s in the mood but more often than not, he\u2019s bothered by the daily requests.\n\nI asked James why he can\u2019t make a sandwich or have a snack (we always have things like hummus, yogurt, pita, sliced veggies, salsa and chips, I make baked goods often\u2026 a good array of decent snacks). He could make a smoothie, there\u2019s always frozen fruit. But he said Adam is just better at it and he doesn\u2019t know how to make it as good.\n\nI felt this was a sign I had dropped the ball so I decided that James would take over making the family dinner once a week. It didn\u2019t have to be fancy but it had to be at least somewhat balanced and filling (for example - yesterday, he made grilled cheese sandwiches, a salad and tomato soup, with a side of cut strawberries. A very simple but good meal. Packaged soups and things are fine as long as that\u2019s not all). I help him with the meal planning and then I would work at the dining room table nearby in case he needed help.\n\nHe hasn\u2019t enjoyed this but I\u2019ve still kept on it because it\u2019s a really important life skill. Feeding yourself isn\u2019t optional. \n\nHe\u2019s been complaining to my mother (his grandma) and she\u2019s been calling me to tell me I\u2019ve let a \u201cpunishment\u201d go on too long. But it\u2019s not meant to be that, it\u2019s life skill training and I was very clear with James that this was a permanent change, not a temporary punishment. \n\nBut she made me feel like an absolutely terrible mother forcing \u201cunpleasant chores\u201c on my children. I tried to point out that my own brother is a grown man that lives on takeout because she never taught him to cook and I didn\u2019t want that to be James one day. She hung up on me. My husband is in full support of our new routine but still, nothing takes you down a peg like being yelled at by your mother so I\u2019m looking for some other opinions. Is it really that bad?", "created_utc": 1694115332, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16co1at/aita_for_insisting_my_son_cook_dinner_once_a_week/", "score": 2155, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Teaching kids how to pick up after themselves, do yard work, sew their own clothes (as in patch them... hole, repair zippers, etc - though hell, the full enchilada isn't a bad idea, either!), and half a billion other \"chores\" are ALL valuable things to know how to do in life. Unless he's planning on living with you or ~~James~~ Adam for the rest of his life, these are things he SHOULD know how to do and you're reinforcing that.\n\nI think what you're doing is great!\n\n**Edit:** If there is ever a day I don't mix up the names in one of these posts, I'll buy a lottery ticket.", "NTA.  You're helping James develop an important life skill and teaching him that weaponized incompetence is not acceptable.  When he grows up and has a partner, they'll be very glad that you taught him this lesson.", "NTA \n\nI didn't like being \"forced\" to learn how to cook a meal as a kid, but it's the one thing my parent did for me that genuinely helped me. Chores aren't always supposed to be fun, but they ARE important for one's everyday life.\n\nWould your mom think you're being cruel or punishing him if you enforced a curfew or made sure he got enough sleep on school nights? This is no different. It's one single day a week and you aren't even expecting a lot from him, just that he shows he can fend for himself in the kitchen.\n\nI also think that making a habit of it now is a good thing. When college/time to move out happens, he's going to snap into junk food for a while, but after that fad ends, he'll want those filling meals that don't make you feel gross for eating afterwards and he won't have to teach himself and build the habits from scratch.\n\nMay I also recommend:\n\n\u2022 having him try making a meal plan for one week (just to show him how, not to add to his chores\n\n\u2022 making a grocery list of what is needed for the household (food and other needs) at least once. This includes checking what you already have and only listing what you need\n\n\u2022 shopping with you for the ingredients ON A BUDGET\n\nMaybe don't make him do it all the time, but at least once is good.

Knowing how to cook is pretty useful when you're an adult.", "NTA- it\u2019s a shame your mother doesn\u2019t realize that cooking is a basic life skill. Everyone should learn.", "NTA- she yelled at you as a defense mechanism because SHE dropped the ball by not teaching your brother to cook. I taught my kids as teens to do laundry and when he got to college, my son thanked me because he was the only one in his dorm who knew how to do it.", "NTA. You\u2019re teaching him an invaluable life skill. Does he prefer savory snacks? Or sweets? Or breakfast? Now that he has some experience, I\u2019d branch out into something he prefers, like making pancakes or eggs on Sunday morning. Or teach him to make pizza or brownies.", "NTA it sounds like your mother feels like it\u2019s okay to raise incompetent children. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s only with her son or if she didn\u2019t teach you how to cook either, but you\u2019re setting up your kids for success by making them learn to cook.", "NTA.

One of my goals with my sons was that they shouldn't be Hardee's commercials (at one time, Hardee's had a commercial that said \"if it weren't for us, some guys would starve.\"). Both are very good at cooking, one is a wonderful baker.  It was so great by the time they were in high school.  If they were home, I could tell them to cook dinner, and what I wanted, and they would cook it.  It was great for all.", "You mean I didn't have to mow the lawn because it was unpleasant?  NTA", "NTA - Cooking is a life skill that needs to be learned because reality will slap your son across the face once he moves out and realize just how expensive food is (happened to me at 23; got my shit together about a week before I moved out and finally learned how to cook some basic dishes). I\u2019d also like to give you credit for not shitting on his meals - like you said, you\u2019re not expecting gourmet level, made from scratch meals, just something that\u2019s somewhat balanced. \n\nAnything that adults have to do as part of everyday survival, like cooking, cleaning, errands, and other chores, should never be viewed as a punishment, and I hope your mom doesn\u2019t support that mindset for much longer.", "NTA, as you said, feeding yourself isn't optional. It's a necessity, and I also don't know what your mother was on about concerning your son knowing how to cook.", "NTA!

You are trying to teach him some life skills that is very valuable in college and behind. \nGrandma is old school, politely ignore her \ud83d\ude00. Good luck with the boys.", "NTA. It's clear that she's offended because you kinda called out her bad parenting (after she pushed you to it).

Tell your mother it's not a punishment, it's a skill you are teaching him to be a better person. \n\nHaving said that, you need to talk to your son because he obviously thinks it's a punishment. Explain to him that it's not. Tell him that you want to work with him to teach him how to cook so that he can do it himself and that it's as important a skill as learning to read or write or drive or whatever. Don't sit at the dining room table. Pick a meal that will challenge him, that you already know how to cook, and then cook that meal with him. Show him what to do. Bond with him over the experience. Short of doing that, you might very possibly turn your son off of cooking.", "&#x200B;\n\nNTA at all.  You doing exactly what you should be doing as a parent.  It is your job to raise your kids to be healthy, independent adults.  They need to know how to cook.\n\nYou're right that your mother should not be providing an opinion if she didn't manage to teach your brother about cooking for himself.  Say \"this is my decision.  Let's talk again when you're ready to discuss something else.\"", "NTA, keep having him cook until he's proficient in knife skills and management.  \n\nAlso start teaching him financial planning and meal planning budgets.  Compare the home made meal costs to take out.  Have him estimate the cost per month for homemade vs takeout and convert that to how many hours of work he would have to do.", "NTA!\n\nBeing able to cook for yourself is a life skill every should learn if they are to live independently. He doesn\u2019t need to be five star chef your son needs to be able to cook for himself.\n\n**Maybe an economics lesson is also needed.** Constantly buying takeout can get expensive. It can also be very unhealthy depending on what you eat. Let him know eventually he won\u2019t live at home and knowing how to fend for yourself is important. This is an important life skill. \n\nMaybe you should invite your brother over to do cooking lessons with your son.", "NTA. Someday he\u2019ll appreciate the lessons.", "So does anyone cook with James?  I agree he needs to have some kitchen skills because he wants to be self sufficient.  Well, he probably doesn\u2019t think he does right now, but he does.  Does your husband cook?   Can he lend a hand?   Ask James what he likes to eat and then work with him to find his signature dish.   Does he like to grill?  Bake?   \n\nGood for you to tell your mom you didn\u2019t want your son helpless in the kitchen like she made your brother.   Keep reminding her you are raising sons who will be a good life partner not a burden\n\nMake sure your boys know how to do the laundry, clean the kitchen, clean a bathroom and vacuum the house.  They use those rooms/they can help keep them clean.", "NTA. You're doing your son and any future partner of his a great service. He also needs to learn to do laundry. Just saying.", "NTA. My dad can't cook and it has negatively affected his whole life. You're doing your son a favour, even if he can't see it yet.", "NTA, but I would elect to allow James to select chores he's more interested in and enjoys after he has demonstrated sufficient knowledge of cooking and meal planning that could get him by when he's an adult. I think it's a good punishment, that both corrects his abuse of Adam's time and teaches him important life skills, but once the punishment phase is up and he knows what he's doing, it would be more fair to allow him to select a chore he likes. It seems like Adam enjoys cooking 2-3x a week, so James should be allowed to select a chore that takes more or less the same amount of time and mental energy, like taking care of the lawn or doing laundry, including mending clothes (something like trash is not sufficient, it doesn't take as long).\n\nAlso, ignore your mother. She sounds like an old-school misogynist who thinks it's inappropriate to raise boys to be anything but utterly incompetent in every single domestic task, and pretty much every other incidental of being an adult.", "NTA at all, youre a good parent and youre not asking for a 5 course meal. He will thank you when hes in college and not wasting his money on takeout like his friends might.", "Fucking grandparents, hey? \"Unpleasant chores\" are chores. They're life. He'll need to learn to cook, now is the time. \nNTA", "I raised three sons who all know how to cook. They were never forced to cook our family anything.

Not only is \u201clearning to cook\u201d important, it\u2019s also important to nip it in the bud that your younger son feels entitled to nag his brother to cook him snacks. People find themselves divorced over that kind of behavior if they carry it over into future relationships, so you\u2019re wise to catch it now!", "Grandma hasnt understood the assignment. NTA - GM a little bit for trying to coodle the 'baby'. You're right that James needs to acquire life skills and not be dependent on others.", "NTA, your mother is the problem. She will coddle him into weaponized incompetence but you can get ahead of it, it's still early. Good luck with James!", "NTA\n\nMy daughter is 19 and son is 17.  Both of them are responsible for dinner one night a week.", "My mom never taught any of my brothers how to cook or anything remotely useful and now they barely can make coffee, let alone cook a simple breakfast.

I was just a kitchen worker when i went on vacation last year and got a call on my last day of it asking if i wanted the cook position that opened up while i was gone. I had little experience, with the reassurance that half the stuff was frozen anyway and i could be trained on the rest. \n\nI spent the first few months with our recipe book open each night using it to make my meals. A year later im only using it to make minestrone soup because of how many ingredients go into it and to make sure i dont miss any. \n\nStart working his way up. Sausage and peppers with penne pasta is easy. Anything thats basically cook up, mix together, and serve should be fine.", "NTA But have you considered shifting to your husband cooking more regularly through the year, too? I feel like it would help James to see that, not just his father doing \"manly\" cooking in the summer.", "YTA\nYes, this is a punishment for him. This isn\u2019t learning to cook but making him cook for the entire family once per week. He may be learning things but he isn\u2019t going to cook more often for himself which is the actual goal here. \n\nYou\u2019re just making him hate cooking more. Your other son enjoys it. So he\u2019s not being punished. \n\nI would suggest changing it and instead make it learn to cook sessions on a weekend for an hour. Make it fun. Start with things that are good to eat, cookies and cakes, then introduce things like HIS favorite meals\u2026 then have him cook dinner with you or help out in the kitchen and so on. But forcing him to cook isn\u2019t going to make him want to cook any more and that\u2019s the real goal.", "NTA as skills are just that, skills. I (67M) have managed to make cooking a hobby. I never eat out, always say to myself \"That was better than it needed to be\". My food costs are ridiculously low because I never, not in four years, eat out.   \n\n\nHowever. You are dealing with a 15 YO. That the older one can, so you are believing that the younger one should. Talent does not work that way. Perhaps it is more in the way you are delivering the message, than the message itself?   \n\n\nThe problem is grandma as she is meddling and enabling James to complain. Then, taking up his cause.", "I know someone who drives an hour each weekend to cook for her son and daughter-in-law.  They have two kids.  This would be your future.  nta", "NAH. James has learned the basics now and understands the value of time. Maybe find a chore that he enjoys doing so that he doesn\u00b4t get more annoyed at you? He is already unhappy and I know personally that if feels like such a waste of time (as a teen) to be forced to learn a chore you already have figured out. He knows simple cooking. The goal is reached. No need to waste time teaching something he has learned.\n\nExample: My mother taught me some basic chores as a teen. I am an adult now, the chores are divided (I live with her). I like doing the laundry but hate doing the dishes with a passion. I know how to do both so my mother has given me laundry duty as one of my chores. I sometimes do dishes but its not my primary chore since my mother is satisfied that I know how to do it, and she doesn\u00b4t worry about my future alone.", "A gentle YTA.\n\nYou said it yourself, Adam *enjoys* cooking. He *likes* doing it. James doesn't. He's clearly shown he's capable of making food if needed, which is all that should be required.\n\nMy son likes to cook, and helps me in the kitchen often; my daughter doesn't, so she usually watches TV or plays in her room while her brother and I cook. Because my son *likes* to help me with it. And this isn't 'doing the dishes' or 'folding the laundry'; cooking's a time-intensive thing, that can get very stressful if you don't enjoy it, or if you don't know what you're doing.\n\nThat's the difference here. I don't think you're actually being TA, I think you're looking at it the wrong way is all. Look at it like reading. Let's say Adam enjoyed reading, and read frequently for fun. James isn't a fan, and while he'll read all his school work, and get his homework done, he doesn't want to read for fun. You making him read in his spare time, just because Adam does, wouldn't be fair, would it? As long as James is *capable* of reading, you wouldn't force him to do it 'for fun', because to him, it's *not* fun. This is the same thing.", "NTA. My mom taught us all to cook after she was on bed rest, and my dad with no cooking skills, came home with a tiny can of Vienna sausages, spaghetti O's, and a bag of salad.  It was meant to feed my mom, who was pregnant with me, him, and my two brothers. \n\nTeaching and insisting he knows how to cook is a vital life skill. It will come to help him some day, and hopefully, he'll retain all of it.", "You mistook him trying to con his brother into making his snacks as him needing to learn how to cook, I can almost guarantee he knows how to cook better than you think and just doesn't like it.", "NTA.\n\nShe yelled and hung up on you because she was ashamed regarding her own failings, and doesn\u2019t want to admit it. Keep up what you are doing, your son will thank you later.", "Your mother's attitude is how young men marry the wrong women, because they need someone to cook and do laundry. A self-sufficient man can take care of himself, and is of much higher value in the world.\nYou're NTA.", "NTA. Not by a long shot. Cooking is as basic of a life skill as wiping your own bottom. \n\nI'm 28f. I have only met ONE man in my vast dating history that can cook and does it well. I plan on marrying this man. We cook together and it's a beautiful thing. \n\nYou're teaching him how to be a self sufficient. But, don't forget that teenagers have it rough in the brain chemistry department. Honestly, I'd find some sort of appropriate acknowledgement to toss his way. Try cooking together. Is there a way to make it more enjoyable/enriching?\n\nThat's just my 2 cents. I'm not a parent. Good luck OP.", "NTA. You're not punishing James or forcing him to do an unpleasant chore, you're teaching and preparing him for when he lives on his own.  \nUnless you could give him a choice between either cooking a family meal or being responsible for making his own meals like making his own breakfast.", "NTA. We started having our son do the same thing around 15. He learned how to meal plan, look up recipes, and grocery shop. It's a literal life skill.\n\nFWIW, we ate a LOT of tacos until he figured out how to cook something else. But we did not complain lol.\n\nI wouldn't use it as punishment, but I think all teens should be taught this, as well as how to do basic household chores.\n\nETA: This is a requirement when it comes to properly \"launching\" a young adult out into the world. How to clean your space, how to feed yourself, and how to manage your money.", "Nope. No one likes chores, but we all need to do them. We made sure our adult child could do laundry, drive, and cook basic thing before college. They were grateful. And it meant they didn\u2019t have to wait on us to wash the clothes they wanted which was a bonus for them.", "NTA, but I think pointing out your brother as an example was throwing gas on the fire.  The first question I would have is whether James does his share of other household chores inside and outside of the house?  I would say if he does, and he has picked up the basics of cooking, then perhaps requiring him to make a weekly meal is not the best path, and he can do other chores instead to pull his weight.", "NTA.  But you have probably taught him the basics at this point, so if he\u2019s not interested/enthusiastic about it, maybe put a pause on it? With the caveat that if he is not cooking for everybody, he doesn\u2019t get special snacks made for him.  He can partake in whatever general meal is being made for everybody.  But he doesn\u2019t get to harass his brother to make him a snack on a regular basis if he cannot be bothered to cook for anybody else. \n\nAlso, you just have to get what your mother said out of your head.  My extended family is extremely favouring of the men, and my aunt actually cried (cried!) when I told her my brother cooks for himself.  I got so angry and asked why she wasn\u2019t upset when I told her I cook and she just said that he is a man and it is not the same.  Thankfully, my brother quite enjoys cooking, but I think what you are doing is great because it gives your younger son a head start, should he ever end up taking an active interest in cooking.", "NTA. I wish my mom had made me do this. I feel so self conscious in the kitchen and don\u2019t really know what I\u2019m doing.", "NTA. And speaking on behalf of his future romantic partners, thank you for doing this.", "NTA and this really is a good life skill to teach him.  There is a great book you can buy for him on amazon.  I bought it in the 90s and it's still for sale.  It's called The Kitchen Survival Guide and breaks down everything.  I've made every single recipe in the cookbook at this point and they are all amazing except for the BBQ chicken wing sauce.  \n\nThe book teaches you how to pick out foods at the grocery store and really breaks it down for someone with no knowledge.", "Don\u2019t force him Ffs. He will just resent you. Take it a bit easy. Tell him to make basic stuff first and gradually tell him to advance. Dumping a family meal on him might be too much. Do that when he would be ready. NTA but don\u2019t be too strict.", "Parents job is to feed their kids. I get the life skill thing, but if you already have one kid cooking 2-3x a week\u2026. Come on. Teens are busy. They have homework and extracurriculars. Cooking for yourself is a reasonable expectation, I don\u2019t think cooking for the family is.", "NTA but.....\n\nHe's already demonstrated that he knows how to cook, so why do you insist on forcing him to continue to do something he obviously resents doing?\n\nIf you want him to learn to hate cooking entirely, this is the way to do it.\n\nI despise cooking. I have a bit of ADHD and just the thought of having to stand around doing nothing but babysit food as it's cooking makes me cringe. I can do it, but if I don't have to, I'm not going to. \n\nIf my mother forced me to cook as a kid, I think I'd be even less likely to cook now than I already am and I already don't ever cook.", "Let him cook", "NTA, but it sounds like he basically knows enough to feed himself fine already, and he clearly views it as a punishment since he hates it either way- so like, what's the point in continuing? It's just going to bubble over into full on resentment eventually, either for you or for cooking in its entirety. Just tell him not to bother his brother anymore.", "Could you balance it out a bit so he doesn\u2019t see it as a punishment. Say he still has to cook but he gets to chose a chore he prefers and his brother also has to do a chore he also isn\u2019t fond of so it\u2019s kind of a life lesson for both boys and not a punishment for one", "NTA this is a great life skill. Make sure he learns one really good full meal including dessert! I\u2019ve charmed the pants off many with my perfect whole roasted chicken with baked veggies and fresh bread and an apple pie. It\u2019s the one meal I can do perfect.", "NTA\u2026 my mom had a list. She worked a lot. My brother and I (a few times a week) had to make dinner and clean up after. We were 11&13 at the time. We also did our own laundry.\n\nMy son actually enjoys cooking and wanted to starting at the age of 10 (with supervision) he still loves it and has gotten damn good at it (he is mid 20\u2019s now.) \n\nSounds like your kids are lazy and rather be catered to instead of breaking away from activities that don\u2019t involve work.", "NTA I\u2019ve always had my sons do chores since they were little. At first it was simple things like sweep the stones off the drive. They loved copying me and their dad and I always gave them some money for doing it. They loved this and felt rewarded. As they got older I assigned them one chore of their choosing each and that would be their chore. if they did this chore they would get a higher allowance and when they wanted to buy something they\u2019d come and ask if they could do other chores until they had enough. I felt happy they were learning to work for things they wanted and over time they have chosen to change chores as they got border. As they got older they learned more things and it became mandatory they did their one chore as their contribution to the household, with flexibility.   \nDue to this and because over time they\u2019ve learned how to do most things I know they would be able to take care of theirselves. Eldest has went off to college and It reassured me he had basic life skills. Even his girlfriends compliment his cooking, yes he can be a lazy student but he\u2019s not helpless and can function as an adult on his own.\n\nI think these things are so important, they\u2019ve had friends right from early on say they would refuse and we are being mean to expect them to do a chore. I always explain this is the rule in our household and their parents will have different rules of their own in their house. I remember so many friends and parents of other kids being impressed by this system. That the boys saw reward out of being taught the basics and that they know they are responsible to know how to do these things for themselves when they are adults. No they didn\u2019t love the chores as they are always going to be repetitive when they could be playing on the computer or out with friends. Thats why we let them pick or change chores when they got fed up of one. However it was the norm to them and despite odd grumbles they just accepted this as they wanted the higher allowance.\n\nOur kids need to know they should never have to rely on others just to do the basics for them.

He makes dinner for the family 2-3x a week because he enjoys it and it gives him an opportunity to try new recipes. I generally cook the rest of the time, unless it\u2019s summer and my husband insists on grilling every day. \n\nJames was not particularly interested in learning to cook. I did try to teach him the kitchen basics and he can make himself a sandwich and simple things but he\u2019d rather grab an apple than make himself a meal.\n\nA few months back, James began asking Adam in the afternoons to make him a snack (something homemade) and sometimes he\u2019ll do it if he\u2019s in the mood but more often than not, he\u2019s bothered by the daily requests.\n\nI asked James why he can\u2019t make a sandwich or have a snack (we always have things like hummus, yogurt, pita, sliced veggies, salsa and chips, I make baked goods often\u2026 a good array of decent snacks). He could make a smoothie, there\u2019s always frozen fruit. But he said Adam is just better at it and he doesn\u2019t know how to make it as good.\n\nI felt this was a sign I had dropped the ball so I decided that James would take over making the family dinner once a week. It didn\u2019t have to be fancy but it had to be at least somewhat balanced and filling (for example - yesterday, he made grilled cheese sandwiches, a salad and tomato soup, with a side of cut strawberries. A very simple but good meal. Packaged soups and things are fine as long as that\u2019s not all). I help him with the meal planning and then I would work at the dining room table nearby in case he needed help.\n\nHe hasn\u2019t enjoyed this but I\u2019ve still kept on it because it\u2019s a really important life skill. Feeding yourself isn\u2019t optional. \n\nHe\u2019s been complaining to my mother (his grandma) and she\u2019s been calling me to tell me I\u2019ve let a \u201cpunishment\u201d go on too long. But it\u2019s not meant to be that, it\u2019s life skill training and I was very clear with James that this was a permanent change, not a temporary punishment. \n\nBut she made me feel like an absolutely terrible mother forcing \u201cunpleasant chores\u201c on my children. I tried to point out that my own brother is a grown man that lives on takeout because she never taught him to cook and I didn\u2019t want that to be James one day. She hung up on me. My husband is in full support of our new routine but still, nothing takes you down a peg like being yelled at by your mother so I\u2019m looking for some other opinions.

Mac & cheese, most pastas, hotdogs\u2026 it\u2019s pretty weird at first, but you get used to it.", "That\u2019s mostly what I\u2019m trying to get at", "We might as well not teach our kids anything until they\u2019re at the point right before needing it. It\u2019s cooking. It\u2019s a basic life skill. He needs to learn and practice it to make sure nobody else is forced to do it for him. As clearly shown by him already asking his older brother to make things for him", "He lives in a household where everybody should be expected to contribute to the running of the household in an age appropriate way.", "Yes already asking others to cook for him. He might as well start asking them to clean his hands for him. Maybe he will just eat with a fork and spoon for the rest of his life and never touch a food item with his hands \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Should he not be forced to do any chores at all then? What makes cooking different to any other chore the parents of this 15 year old child makes him do/teaches him? He\u2019s a kid, it\u2019s his parents\u2019 job to prepare him as much as they can for the real world.", "I had a neighbor once (when I lived on a military base) who had nothing in her pantry but a case of canned peas and a couple dozen packs of ramen. I don\u2019t know what she had in her fridge but I bet it wasn\u2019t much. All this to say girls need to learn to cook too. We ate a lot of homemade pizza when I was a kid because I learned how to make it (and applesauce!) in home ec when I was about 12. We had it at least once a week, more often if my father was on the road (he was a truck driver).", "The next line after that was him saying he doesn't know how to make anything good. That's when him learning how to cook began. \n\nSo the his brother being better isn't the issue it was him not knowing how to cook.  I asked my question to see if that mission of him learning (at least the basics) was accomplished. \n\nI don't know why hin saying his brother is a better cook is some gotcha moment", "This seems like a pointless debate.  Not saying she was doing it wrong. Just pointing out that you can parent with a carrot a stick.", "I bought mine for the heat activated adhesive for edging shelving, lol.", "What a great idea!  I'll try that before I buy a steamer.  I \\*think\\* I have that nozzle attachment somewhere.", "And in skimming past, I read \u201cDIY fascists\u201d \u2014 so that made for an amusing double take.", "Ah, dry-roning is the best!", "Yeah but OP already confirmed that the kid now knows how to make basic meals.  He knows the basics of cooking. So he has a basic life skill. He will get practice when he wants a snack when he is hungry, because now he knows how to make it and knows that his mother can easily force him to cook again. The lesson is learned. Time to focus on some other chores he might not know. \n\n>op should maybe focus on some other life-basics\n\nIn what part of this did I say that op should not teach the kid anything before needing it?", "Except he clearly isn't \"practicing\" when he wants a snack because he was hassling his brother to do it. He literally made this an issue because he's freaking lazy.", "Has OP commented somewhere else that James went back to hassling his brother? I would think the kid had gotten the message to not hassle his brother now..."]}
