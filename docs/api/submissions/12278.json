{"id": 12278, "submission_id": "11r6wz8", "title": "AITA for suggesting my stepson (16M) moves out?", "selftext": "My husband and I have 6 children total and live in 4 bedroom house. We have two sons together (8 & 6), I have a son from a previous relationship (15), and I have 3 step children (20F, 16M & 16F). We live in a 4 bedroom house and for most the time we lived there we had 2 kids per room with the youngest boys sharing, the older boys sharing and the girls sharing. \n\nThings changed a couple years ago. My oldest stepdaughter finished school and is attending university locally. The girls decided at this point that instead of sharing a bedroom at their dads and sharing a bedroom at their mums, they would each take 1 room as their permanent bedroom. So the 16 yr old lives with us full time and the 20 yr old lives with her mum full time. They both visit the other parents house regularly. \n\nMy 16 yr old stepson has his own bedroom at his mum's house but still splits time between each parents house mostly 50/50. My son lives full time with us as he doesn't have much of a relationship with his dad. My son and stepson do not get on that well and they can often be heard screaming at each other in their bedroom. \n\nRecently, I asked my stepson why he doesn't move to live full time with his mum so he and my son can have a similar arrangement as their sisters. This way both of the boys would have their own rooms. He would obviously still visit like his older sister does and we could figure something out like a futon instead of a bed in their room so my son has more space when stepson's not there. \n\nMy stepson overreacted to my suggestion and is trying to make out like I'm kicking him out, when really I'm just thinking of a better use of space. It's unfair that all the older kids but my son have their own rooms at one of their parents house. My son likes the idea and has brought it up to his stepbrother a few more times since I originally suggested it and it has caused arguments between them. He now seems to be considering it. \n\nMy husband is angry with me for suggesting his son moving permanently to his mums. He thinks that he and his son would have a less close relationship if this happens (my husband favours his oldest son over our boys). He also thinks I'm making his son feel like he's being forced out. However, it was his daughters already doing the same thing that gave me the idea because it worked out well for them and they both seem happier. I'm also not forcing this to happen I was just suggesting it to him, it would be completely up to him. Is this a good plan or AITA for bringing it up?", "created_utc": 1678802505, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11r6wz8/aita_for_suggesting_my_stepson_16m_moves_out/", "score": 302, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Of course he feels upset and rejected. You were wrong to bring it up, especially directly to him without your husband's involvement...that's a real 'wicked stepmother' kind of move.

You didn't handle this tactfully at all and for that you're going to get a lot of 'wicked stepmother' jibes. I understand that objectively this may make the most logical sense; the household is less congested and both boys get their privacy, but there are so many other factors to consider. What's his relationship like with his Mother? What's that household like? Would she want/be able to have him live there full time? Even if these answers are all positive he may like having both homes/families involved equally and rightfully see removing one as a big step he's not ready for.  \n\nAlso, poor form for going rogue and not discussing it with his Dad first.

Logistically this may make sense but the fact that you don't seem to comprehend why he acted this way makes me think your delivery was way off.\n\nYou cannot compare this living arrangement to that of the other girls.

This boy is still a child. \n\nYou should have spoken to your husband about this who would have quite rightfully shut you down.

We have two sons together (8 & 6), I have a son from a previous relationship (15), and I have 3 step children (20F, 16M & 16F). We live in a 4 bedroom house and for most the time we lived there we had 2 kids per room with the youngest boys sharing, the older boys sharing and the girls sharing. \n\nThings changed a couple years ago. My oldest stepdaughter finished school and is attending university locally. The girls decided at this point that instead of sharing a bedroom at their dads and sharing a bedroom at their mums, they would each take 1 room as their permanent bedroom. So the 16 yr old lives with us full time and the 20 yr old lives with her mum full time. They both visit the other parents house regularly. \n\nMy 16 yr old stepson has his own bedroom at his mum's house but still splits time between each parents house mostly 50/50. My son lives full time with us as he doesn't have much of a relationship with his dad. My son and stepson do not get on that well and they can often be heard screaming at each other in their bedroom. \n\nRecently, I asked my stepson why he doesn't move to live full time with his mum so he and my son can have a similar arrangement as their sisters. This way both of the boys would have their own rooms. He would obviously still visit like his older sister does and we could figure something out like a futon instead of a bed in their room so my son has more space when stepson's not there. \n\nMy stepson overreacted to my suggestion and is trying to make out like I'm kicking him out, when really I'm just thinking of a better use of space. It's unfair that all the older kids but my son have their own rooms at one of their parents house. My son likes the idea and has brought it up to his stepbrother a few more times since I originally suggested it and it has caused arguments between them. He now seems to be considering it. \n\nMy husband is angry with me for suggesting his son moving permanently to his moms. He thinks that he and his son would have a less close relationship if this happens (my husband favours his oldest son over our boys). He also thinks I'm making his son feel like he's being forced out. However, it was his daughters already doing the same thing that gave me the idea because it worked out well for them and they both seem happier. I'm also not forcing this to happen I was just suggesting it to him, it would be completely up to him. Is this a good plan or AITA for bringing it up?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Me and my sister shared a room and my brothers shared a room. My sister and I would butt heads a lot and fight.  It wasn\u2019t a great fit because of how close we are in age and because I have a disability. Now that we\u2019ve each, except for the older brother of the two boys have moved out and lived independently from our parents house for a few years, we\u2019re on mich better terms and like being around each other. My three younger siblings and the three youngest sisters (gap of seven years between youngest brother) are all living with my parents still. I recently got married, so I mostly just visit.

They are in a very difficult situation, but it can be an opportunity to learn some social skills that will serve them well as they transition to adulthood. \n\nIt sounds like it would be easier for you to have your stepson out so you won\u2019t have to deal with the conflict.
