{"id": 12278, "submission_id": "11r6wz8", "title": "AITA for suggesting my stepson (16M) moves out?", "selftext": "My husband and I have 6 children total and live in 4 bedroom house. We have two sons together (8 & 6), I have a son from a previous relationship (15), and I have 3 step children (20F, 16M & 16F). We live in a 4 bedroom house and for most the time we lived there we had 2 kids per room with the youngest boys sharing, the older boys sharing and the girls sharing. \n\nThings changed a couple years ago. My oldest stepdaughter finished school and is attending university locally. The girls decided at this point that instead of sharing a bedroom at their dads and sharing a bedroom at their mums, they would each take 1 room as their permanent bedroom. So the 16 yr old lives with us full time and the 20 yr old lives with her mum full time. They both visit the other parents house regularly. \n\nMy 16 yr old stepson has his own bedroom at his mum's house but still splits time between each parents house mostly 50/50. My son lives full time with us as he doesn't have much of a relationship with his dad. My son and stepson do not get on that well and they can often be heard screaming at each other in their bedroom. \n\nRecently, I asked my stepson why he doesn't move to live full time with his mum so he and my son can have a similar arrangement as their sisters. This way both of the boys would have their own rooms. He would obviously still visit like his older sister does and we could figure something out like a futon instead of a bed in their room so my son has more space when stepson's not there. \n\nMy stepson overreacted to my suggestion and is trying to make out like I'm kicking him out, when really I'm just thinking of a better use of space. It's unfair that all the older kids but my son have their own rooms at one of their parents house. My son likes the idea and has brought it up to his stepbrother a few more times since I originally suggested it and it has caused arguments between them. He now seems to be considering it. \n\nMy husband is angry with me for suggesting his son moving permanently to his mums. He thinks that he and his son would have a less close relationship if this happens (my husband favours his oldest son over our boys). He also thinks I'm making his son feel like he's being forced out. However, it was his daughters already doing the same thing that gave me the idea because it worked out well for them and they both seem happier. I'm also not forcing this to happen I was just suggesting it to him, it would be completely up to him. Is this a good plan or AITA for bringing it up?", "created_utc": 1678802505, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11r6wz8/aita_for_suggesting_my_stepson_16m_moves_out/", "score": 2049, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

What's his relationship like with his Mother? What's that household like? Would she want/be able to have him live there full time? Even if these answers are all positive he may like having both homes/families involved equally and rightfully see removing one as a big step he's not ready for.  \n\nAlso, poor form for going rogue and not discussing it with his Dad first.

Logistically this may make sense but the fact that you don't seem to comprehend why he acted this way makes me think your delivery was way off.\n\nYou cannot compare this living arrangement to that of the other girls.

We have two sons together (8 & 6), I have a son from a previous relationship (15), and I have 3 step children (20F, 16M & 16F). We live in a 4 bedroom house and for most the time we lived there we had 2 kids per room with the youngest boys sharing, the older boys sharing and the girls sharing. \n\nThings changed a couple years ago. My oldest stepdaughter finished school and is attending university locally. The girls decided at this point that instead of sharing a bedroom at their dads and sharing a bedroom at their mums, they would each take 1 room as their permanent bedroom. So the 16 yr old lives with us full time and the 20 yr old lives with her mum full time. They both visit the other parents house regularly. \n\nMy 16 yr old stepson has his own bedroom at his mum's house but still splits time between each parents house mostly 50/50. My son lives full time with us as he doesn't have much of a relationship with his dad. My son and stepson do not get on that well and they can often be heard screaming at each other in their bedroom. \n\nRecently, I asked my stepson why he doesn't move to live full time with his mum so he and my son can have a similar arrangement as their sisters. This way both of the boys would have their own rooms. He would obviously still visit like his older sister does and we could figure something out like a futon instead of a bed in their room so my son has more space when stepson's not there. \n\nMy stepson overreacted to my suggestion and is trying to make out like I'm kicking him out, when really I'm just thinking of a better use of space. It's unfair that all the older kids but my son have their own rooms at one of their parents house. My son likes the idea and has brought it up to his stepbrother a few more times since I originally suggested it and it has caused arguments between them. He now seems to be considering it. \n\nMy husband is angry with me for suggesting his son moving permanently to his moms. He thinks that he and his son would have a less close relationship if this happens (my husband favours his oldest son over our boys). He also thinks I'm making his son feel like he's being forced out. However, it was his daughters already doing the same thing that gave me the idea because it worked out well for them and they both seem happier. I'm also not forcing this to happen I was just suggesting it to him, it would be completely up to him. Is this a good plan or AITA for bringing it up?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Me and my sister shared a room and my brothers shared a room. My sister and I would butt heads a lot and fight.  It wasn\u2019t a great fit because of how close we are in age and because I have a disability. Now that we\u2019ve each, except for the older brother of the two boys have moved out and lived independently from our parents house for a few years, we\u2019re on mich better terms and like being around each other. My three younger siblings and the three youngest sisters (gap of seven years between youngest brother) are all living with my parents still. I recently got married, so I mostly just visit.

I have BPD, and I would never dream of doing anything like that. Being manipulative like OP doesn't even come under the symptoms for BPD, and nothing I actually saw in the post remotely suggests it either. \n\nBPD is having extreme negative emotions - such as rage instead of anger, grief instead of sadness, fear instead of being mildly scared, none seen in the OP - disturbed patterns of thinking/perception (such as hallucinations or delusions, dont see any of that in the OP), having impulsive behaviour (such as drug use, binging, shopping sprees etc, which it doesn't sound like the decision to make the suggestion was), and having intense but unstable relationships with others, which again, isn't seen in the OP - she doesn't appear to intensely hate, then greatly love, the stepchildren or her husband, there doesn't appear to be any flipping back and forth either.\n\nSo what is it exactly that makes you say she's potentially got BPD? Just because she appears to be not overly maternal towards her stepchildren and is happy for them to live with their mother and is encouraging it with the stepson, that doesn't mean she's got BPD. Not every nasty person out there has BPD, and it's people like you who attribute it to every nasty person that makes it really hard for those of us who have BPD and want to do therapy and become a better person to not be stigmatised and get refused chances to meet people unless we hide it.", "Now she's set up a situation where her stepson will have to be disciplined for the harassment, and she'll either have to side with him and fight with her husband or make her own son resentful by letting him get in trouble for her idea.", "Honestly in this day and age I wonder the same thing. \n\nI've come to the awkward and rude realization that they do not have anything else to contribute to this world other than squeezing another offspring from between their legs. They enjoy the fleeting fun moments of children and once the offspring grows out of being cute and the attention to the parents wane they decide to restart the roller coaster over and over again to the detriment of the current offspring whose quality of life drops more and more with each subsequent addition. \n\nBig families do not really have a place in the current world at least in our first world societies. Having your 16 year old become a secondary parent to your newborn is fdsgusting and robbing that child from living a normal 16 year old life. Having a 10 year old that has a sibling be old enough to be their parent is weird to me. They will never have a traditional relationship with eachother and the older sibling will likely go off and start their adult life before building much of a relationship with their youngest siblings. \n\nReal easy and cheap to avoid creating more babies but people (especially lower income households) keep on going with the baby mill.

But that doesn't make it okay for her to push her step-son out. \nOP YTA, and it sounds like both you and your husband need to be doing a better job parenting your children fairly and consistently. However, this should done by you and your husband having some serious discussion and getting some perspective on the dynamics in your family. Maybe some family therapy.  This should not include you trying to get your step-son to move out for the sake of space. You knew what you were getting into when you got married and had more kids. Providing adequate housing is your job as the parent.

This is what I meant by her having an 'ulterior motive' when asking him to move in with his mum full-time. \nThat is something she should be communicating with her husband, not forcing the 16-year-old out. \nI hope OP reads these comments and takes them on board, and works on resolving this rather than removing the post & continuing down this path.", "Right?
