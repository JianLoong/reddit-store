It's not going to be a super expensive or crazy wedding because we aren't about that kind of thing (and we're saving for a down payment for our first house), but I am so excited to get to spend the rest of my life with this dork.\n\nThe problem is that my good friend \"Maddie\" \\[26F\\] wants to bring her support dog Hans \\[2M\\]. I like hans. He is really cute and Maddie loves him so much. She got him when he was a puppy because she has diabetes and he can tell when her blood sugar is spiking or something and he keeps snacks in a pouch that he has on his back. I've never seen him do this but she says that he is totally specially trained and she spent 2k on him. She's worked at home pretty much since she got him, so I don't know how well socialized he is and I haven't seen him in a large group of people.\n\nThe thing is that my FMIL \\[52F\\] doesn't like to be around dogs. It's not an allergy, she just had a bad experience with a dog once when she was younger and needed stitches and now she's afraid of them. I've seen her around dogs and she gets really scared and shakey and needs to get away from the dog. She didn't really like me when me and Dan started dating and so I'm really afraid of making her not like me again especially since we live in his home town and my family is 1000 miles away.\n\nMaddie promises me that Hans is really well behaved and won't run at my FMIL and she won't need to be near him at all. She says that she needs Hans because what if she goes into diabetic shock but I told her my FSIL is an ER nurse so she would be okay and my FSIL could be like Hans for the night. Also there are a lot of little kids and Hans is a big dog. I haven't seen him around kids before, so I don't know if he will be okay with them.\n\nI asked Dan if he could talk to his mom but he said that if Hans comes his mom will walk out of the wedding and she's his mom and she should come first. I really want to make Maddie happy because she's one of my best friends here, but when I told her that Hans couldn't come she got really mad at me and accused me of putting my FMIL's \"baby fears\" as she calls them, before her life.\n\nSo reddit, AITA?", "created_utc": 1680387608, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1290ui2/aita_for_not_letting_my_friend_bring_her_support/", "score": 105, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

My MIL likes to push me me around and after I had children I didn\u2019t put up with it anymore.

I like hans. He is really cute and Maddie loves him so much. She got him when he was a puppy because she has diabetes and he can tell when her blood sugar is spiking or something and he keeps snacks in a pouch that he has on his back. I've never seen him do this but she says that he is totally specially trained and she spent 2k on him. She's worked at home pretty much since she got him, so I don't know how well socialized he is and I haven't seen him in a large group of people.\n\nThe thing is that my FMIL \\[52F\\] doesn't like to be around dogs. It's not an allergy, she just had a bad experience with a dog once when she was younger and needed stitches and now she's afraid of them. I've seen her around dogs and she gets really scared and shakey and needs to get away from the dog. She didn't really like me when me and Dan started dating and so I'm really afraid of making her not like me again especially since we live in his home town and my family is 1000 miles away.\n\nMaddie promises me that Hans is really well behaved and won't run at my FMIL and she won't need to be near him at all. She says that she needs Hans because what if she goes into diabetic shock but I told her my FSIL is an ER nurse so she would be okay and my FSIL could be like Hans for the night. Also there are a lot of little kids and Hans is a big dog. I haven't seen him around kids before, so I don't know if he will be okay with them.\n\nI asked Dan if he could talk to his mom but he said that if Hans comes his mom will walk out of the wedding and she's his mom and she should come first. I really want to make Maddie happy because she's one of my best friends here, but when I told her that Hans couldn't come she got really mad at me and accused me of putting my FMIL's \"baby fears\" as she calls them, before her life.\n\nSo reddit, AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

These are trained to deal with the much more complex symptoms that can come with diabetes, as not all diabetics have an easy to control form of the disease. Chances are that she has struggled with symptoms previously despite medical devices and thus had to spend 2000 on a dog. Trust me, service animals are EXPENSIVE and a long wait list to get. No one is getting a fun medical response dog just for fun if they can get a cheap blood sugar reader and call it a day.", "OP obviously doesn\u2019t know the difference between support animals and service animals. That doesn\u2019t mean the dog isn\u2019t a service animal.", "Yes.  It's defined as a dog trained to perform specific tasks to assist with a disability or medical condition.   For example,  a dog trained to smell a diabetic's low blood sugar.", "Op obviously doesn't understand what type it is. It's trained to do a job service to keep someone alive aka service dog", "OP is wrong and so are you. Get with the program", "Yeah, but OP is incorrect. The dog meets the legal definition.", "Her dog does the same thing her blood sugar tester does. Im sure its a great comfort to have her dog around her during 99% of her life. But preparing to be away from the dog for a few hours is not an impossible task. She can discreetly test and trend her sugar levels throughout the night. Its not like her dog administers her insulin for her.", "Shaking and scared and needing to get away from the dog is a phobia, yes. A phobia is as much of a medical condition as diabetes. OP has to choose and it's the groom's mom. Sucky situation, but minimizing mental illnesses like phobias is not the answer.", "Its not that tho, is it. Its a dog that smells her blood sugar. Exact same thing that a blood sugar tester does.", "At least in my country, clinical guidelines for using diabetic assistance animals do NOT allow you to use them as a supplementation for BGL testing (i.e. you must still fingerprick test with the same frequency). They can only as a complimentary tool.", "My husband and one daughter are type 1 diabetics. We have a service dog. That dog will literally wake up us in the middle of the night to alert us to blood sugars getting out of wack so we can act before it becomes a problem. If we can't take the service dog we aren't going.", "A service dog must be trained to act amongst people.   We have no idea if this one is.  I accept OP at her word", "A service dog must also be trained to deal with people.  We have no indication that this one is", "She cannot continually test her blood to monitor for changes.  The dog can.", "OP didn't say that her future mother in law had a phobia though.", "But it alerts her to the symptoms before she even notices them herself. Why should she have to check her blood sugar every 15 minutes when she already has a medical device that does that on a continual basis?\n\nAnd you didn\u2019t answer my question.", "Yeah it\u2019s not the same. A person who can\u2019t see doesn\u2019t randomly drop dead without their dog there to help, while someone with diabetes can.", "OP is judging the dog based on the fact that she has never seen him out in a large crowd. That doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s not properly trained, it just means that she doesn\u2019t know enough to judge.", "And I don't.", "You accept OP clearly at her word when she clearly doesn\u2019t understand the definition of a service dog. She said support dog and described a service dog, so it\u2019s pretty clear she used the wrong term. \n\nYou\u2019re an AH along with OP for clinging on to semantics when OP clearly described what she meant.", "There is no service dog trainers on the planet that would go through the effort to train a dog to detect dropping blood sugar and then not train it to be around people. That's not atball how that industry works. Those dogs go through years of training and are specifically  selected for that task.", "\" She got him when he was a puppy because she has diabetes and he can tell when her blood sugar is spiking or something and he keeps snacks in a pouch that he has on his back. I've never seen him do this but she says that he is totally specially trained and she spent 2k on him. \" she got him at a puppy and he is trained . Op even stated it. Op also stated she's never seen the dog around crowds just because she's never seen the dog around crowds doesn't mean op knows how the dog will react op is assuming that op knows how a dog she's never seen reacts . Op don't know anything g about the dog but the price and that it's a diabetes dog and that it's trained", "Also here's proof it's trained you can find this comment in the link I am posting [Diabetes alert dogs are initially trained to behave correctly in public and to cope with noise, traffic, crowds, traveling, etc.](https://www.diabetesselfmanagement.com/about-diabetes/general-diabetes-information/diabetes-alert-dogs/)", "THIS. Why should Maddie have to spend $$$$ on testing strips and take her blood sugar every 15-30 mins when she has a dog that does it for her constantly?", "She can. She absolutely can.\n\nMany people with diabetes have monitors on them constantly. That gives them, and people around them, *real time* information. \n\nEven if she doesn\u2019t have one of those devices, she can *so easily* test her sugar whenever she wants. Diabetes isn\u2019t like having epilepsy. Things don\u2019t just crash and burn within seconds. It takes hours. For that reason, having a dog like that live with you is a great idea to monitor her while she sleeps. But its hardly a necessity for a few hours at a private event. \n\nShe would have more than enough time to notice she was trending into an emergency. And would likely have to bring her insulin and a little sugar with her whether she has the dog or not. She still has to self administer her own care. Whether its take an insulin injection or eat a piece of candy. The dog doesn\u2019t do that for her. \n\nThe dog just prevents her from having to test so frequently. So just making sure she tests at certain intervals throughout the few hours is hardly difficult. She should know her diabetes well enough to know how frequently she has to test.\n\nI worked with tons of diabetic patients. Most only test 1-2 times a day. The ones that need to test more than that have the monitors that test 24/7 in real time.", "Lol, a person with diabetes doesn\u2019t *randomly* drop dead either. \n\nEven having the dog doesn\u2019t remove the necessity for her to test at regular intervals throughout the day. The dog is a great tool for someone living alone, as it can be there to monitor her while she sleeps. But it doesn\u2019t administer her insulin for her, or call 911. Its just an extra safety net to prompt her to test her sugar. Going 3-4 hours without the dog is *hardly* unreasonable in this scenario.", "Testing strips are so cheap. Even if the dog alerted her, she would still have to test her own blood sugar. \n\nY\u2019all are acting like diabetes is the same as epilepsy. Trends happen over long hours. Diabetes is well understood and managed. Its not like someone is fine and then just has a \u201cdiabetes attack\u201d out of nowhere.", "And clearly you know better than Maddie and her doctor what her specific situation requires.", "Given that she paid out of pocket to get her own service dog trained, doesn\u2019t sound like her doctor found it medically necessary either."]}
