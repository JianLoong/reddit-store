It's not going to be a super expensive or crazy wedding because we aren't about that kind of thing (and we're saving for a down payment for our first house), but I am so excited to get to spend the rest of my life with this dork.\n\nThe problem is that my good friend \"Maddie\" \\[26F\\] wants to bring her support dog Hans \\[2M\\]. I like hans. He is really cute and Maddie loves him so much. She got him when he was a puppy because she has diabetes and he can tell when her blood sugar is spiking or something and he keeps snacks in a pouch that he has on his back. I've never seen him do this but she says that he is totally specially trained and she spent 2k on him. She's worked at home pretty much since she got him, so I don't know how well socialized he is and I haven't seen him in a large group of people.\n\nThe thing is that my FMIL \\[52F\\] doesn't like to be around dogs. It's not an allergy, she just had a bad experience with a dog once when she was younger and needed stitches and now she's afraid of them. I've seen her around dogs and she gets really scared and shakey and needs to get away from the dog. She didn't really like me when me and Dan started dating and so I'm really afraid of making her not like me again especially since we live in his home town and my family is 1000 miles away.\n\nMaddie promises me that Hans is really well behaved and won't run at my FMIL and she won't need to be near him at all. She says that she needs Hans because what if she goes into diabetic shock but I told her my FSIL is an ER nurse so she would be okay and my FSIL could be like Hans for the night. Also there are a lot of little kids and Hans is a big dog. I haven't seen him around kids before, so I don't know if he will be okay with them.\n\nI asked Dan if he could talk to his mom but he said that if Hans comes his mom will walk out of the wedding and she's his mom and she should come first. I really want to make Maddie happy because she's one of my best friends here, but when I told her that Hans couldn't come she got really mad at me and accused me of putting my FMIL's \"baby fears\" as she calls them, before her life.\n\nSo reddit, AITA?", "created_utc": 1680387608, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1290ui2/aita_for_not_letting_my_friend_bring_her_support/", "score": 2201, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I like hans. He is really cute and Maddie loves him so much. She got him when he was a puppy because she has diabetes and he can tell when her blood sugar is spiking or something and he keeps snacks in a pouch that he has on his back. I've never seen him do this but she says that he is totally specially trained and she spent 2k on him. She's worked at home pretty much since she got him, so I don't know how well socialized he is and I haven't seen him in a large group of people.\n\nThe thing is that my FMIL \\[52F\\] doesn't like to be around dogs. It's not an allergy, she just had a bad experience with a dog once when she was younger and needed stitches and now she's afraid of them. I've seen her around dogs and she gets really scared and shakey and needs to get away from the dog. She didn't really like me when me and Dan started dating and so I'm really afraid of making her not like me again especially since we live in his home town and my family is 1000 miles away.\n\nMaddie promises me that Hans is really well behaved and won't run at my FMIL and she won't need to be near him at all. She says that she needs Hans because what if she goes into diabetic shock but I told her my FSIL is an ER nurse so she would be okay and my FSIL could be like Hans for the night. Also there are a lot of little kids and Hans is a big dog. I haven't seen him around kids before, so I don't know if he will be okay with them.\n\nI asked Dan if he could talk to his mom but he said that if Hans comes his mom will walk out of the wedding and she's his mom and she should come first. I really want to make Maddie happy because she's one of my best friends here, but when I told her that Hans couldn't come she got really mad at me and accused me of putting my FMIL's \"baby fears\" as she calls them, before her life.\n\nSo reddit, AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

That gives them, and people around them, *real time* information. \n\nEven if she doesn\u2019t have one of those devices, she can *so easily* test her sugar whenever she wants. Diabetes isn\u2019t like having epilepsy. Things don\u2019t just crash and burn within seconds. It takes hours. For that reason, having a dog like that live with you is a great idea to monitor her while she sleeps. But its hardly a necessity for a few hours at a private event. \n\nShe would have more than enough time to notice she was trending into an emergency. And would likely have to bring her insulin and a little sugar with her whether she has the dog or not. She still has to self administer her own care. Whether its take an insulin injection or eat a piece of candy. The dog doesn\u2019t do that for her. \n\nThe dog just prevents her from having to test so frequently. So just making sure she tests at certain intervals throughout the few hours is hardly difficult.

You described a service dog, which is a highly trained canine that performs certain tasks for their owner. Most, if not all of these dogs, are there to detect and handle medical conditions, such as seizures, blindness, and diabetes. These dogs have to go through special training to behave themselves a specific way in the general public. This is a meticulous process that generally takes the first few YEARS of their life to train for. \nI explain because your friend sounds like she has a service dog, not an emotional support dog. If she has a dog to alert for low blood sugars, that can mean they happen often. If treated before they\u2019re not a big deal, but wait too long and they can become severe quick. Service animals are allowed in non-pet friendly spaces because the owners can\u2019t function without them present, and they\u2019re protected under law as medical devices. \nTo your friend, telling her to leave the dog at home is like telling her to leave her insulin at home. It\u2019s a severe danger to her health, and she feels you don\u2019t give a shit about her health. Your FMIL would only be able to TREAT the emergency (which would be embarrassing, expensive since she\u2019ll have to be hospitalized, and as a diabetic, low blood sugars make you feel like you\u2019re dying), the dog can PREVENT it (by alerting early where she can find some food and an out-of-the-way corner). I understand the rough past of your FMIL but service dogs are specially trained to NEVER bite, even if they themselves are being attacked. People think service dog owners are stuck-up, but they don\u2019t know that those with service dogs can possibly DIE without them. Disinvite your friend\u2019s dog and you will NEVER regain her trust. I think you and friend, then maybe you and FMIL need a sit-down to talk this out. You WILL be TA if you read this post/comment and still disinvite the dog, but it doesn\u2019t sound too late yet.", "more info needed. I watched the documentary on service dogs, they aren't certified and trained as puppies? So she spent $2k on a dog and then had him go through rigorous service training? This sounds slightly sus.

It sounds like OP is skeptical of her friend's legit medical reliance of her dog. \n\nAlso, without question, the FMIL is out of line. To walk out of a wedding because of a service dog is the most selfish, attention seeking, drama thirsty, immature behavior. She's a grown up, she needs therapy. Does she really have a dog phobia?

Are you going to also forbid any dog from any gathering you ever host that MIL would come to, forever? Do you and fianc\u00e9 plan to never, ever have a dog of your own? It sounds like OP and fianc\u00e9 aren\u2019t really dog people, or they wouldn\u2019t be concerned about a trained service dog being around kids (the service dog would be on a leash, also, and not a free-roaming pet), so maybe they don\u2019t really care about this. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a super easy decision. \n\nIdeally, imo, there would be some kind of compromise that doesn\u2019t set a precedent for excluding this friend from gatherings in the future, like making sure MIL and Maddie are seated as far apart as possible. I understand some people have extremely valid reasons for being afraid of dogs (I was attacked as a child by a big dog, but am a happy dog owner now \u2014 small dogs, though) but would consider the practicality of this going forward. If you leave your house, it\u2019s not unlikely you will see a dog. MIL wouldn\u2019t be interacting with the dog and the dog wouldn\u2019t be off-leash. And if OP still feels anxious over MIL\u2019s initial dislike, that sounds like a separate issue to work through before this wedding, and Maddie shouldn\u2019t pay for it.", "Well, is there a compromise? Maybe the friend and the MiL are seated on opposite sides.", "People in this sub are WAY too ready to uninvite immediate family from weddings because of small things, like do people not understand that the *man getting married* probably wants *his own mother* there?

That's the *entire* issue.  OP wants her friend there, but in order for her to attend she will have to bring her service dog with her because it's a medical necessity for her.

Not allowing a service dog access is ridiculous just because someone else has a fear. A service dog isn\u2019t just a companion, it\u2019s there to alert for life threatening circumstances.\n\nThe future sister in law may be an ER nurse but so am I and I would never think something like this is ok.

Sure the dog is not an immediate danger to FMIL but she will not enjoy that wedding with a dog in it. Bride needs to choose someone in between who will be the immediate family vs a friend. People here just see the \"diabetes, dog\" words together and make a judgment without showing any empathy toward the other side. I remind you bride does not want the dog because she dislikes dogs its because her FMIL has a trauma surrounding dogs. NAH", "You have a point.

Running obviously makes it worse (the dogs are all good dogs and thinks she wants to play so they chase after her), so it\u2019s that or she freezes and just screams and cries uncontrollably. She\u2019s too small and terrified to fight them. It\u2019s terrible. She climbs up either me or my husband and just shakes in fear. \n\nThey are always good dogs (labs, goldens, all lovable, sweet, good dogs) but none of that reasoning matters. It does not make a single difference to her. It kicks in her survival instinct and it is very hard to shut that off. We are working through it with continued exposure and therapy and medication, but it is very very difficult to overcome. \n\nI feel very bad for everyone involved here. There are many events that we decline because our daughter just can\u2019t handle being around the dogs present and it\u2019s literal torture for her. It sounds like the FMIL deals with her fear by removing herself from the situation, which is perfectly acceptable. Unfortunately she is the mother of the groom and this is also his wedding. If he loves his mother and has a good relationship with her, it\u2019s reasonable that his desire for the woman who gave birth to him and raised him to attend his wedding come before your friend, no matter how close you may be with her.\n\nYour friend is still invited, OP. If she is able to monitor her sugar levels manually without the help of Hans, she should join you on your special day. Maybe she can come to the ceremony and then head home so she\u2019s not without Hans for too long. If her sugar levels drop too unexpectedly and she needs Hans with her to keep her safe, then your friend is allowed to not attend. It is an invitation not a summons.\n\nMaybe the best compromise (other than her attending the ceremony and then dipping our early) since you aren\u2019t having a big wedding is to host a celebratory night out with your friends after the wedding and go to a fun bar for drinks and revelry, that way Maddie can still celebrate with you.\n\nIt\u2019s not ideal. Few things in life ever are. But this is something you will be dealing with as long as your FMIL lives.

My young granddaughter (no known trauma) is literally frozen with fear at the approach of even the smallest leashed dog. It\u2019s not something that can be just reasoned away or simply got over", "And you can hit a severe low without feeling like you\u2019re crashing.\n\nMy older brothers best friend wasn\u2019t ever great at managing his Type I but he stayed in shape and generally ate well. He just wasn\u2019t good at remembering to check his blood sugar. But he was usually really good at feeling a crash coming with plenty of time to get some glucose syrup or honey or whatever. I\u2019m sure this\u2019ll be no surprise, but he _didn\u2019t_ feel one coming one afternoon, crashed into a coma, and died at 43.\n\nIf he\u2019d had a service dog, he\u2019d very likely still be around.", "Yup! Oh honey, you thought you were a bridesmaid? Nope, you're working (for free obviously). You don't get a chart, any history, or tools, and you have no doctor. Still enjoy the night though! The seltzer is to die for.", "Exactly, not to mention, FSIL can only try to help once things have progressed to the point of an emergency. Hans' can detect the change before Maddie even feels anything and prevent an emergency altogether.", "this isn't an allergy though, it's fear of dogs.  not anywhere near important enough to risk someone's life by forbidding their doctor-prescribed service animal because somebody is squeamish about dogs.  it's a trained service dog, it won't go near the woman or bother her in any way.  this is a bunch of ableist bullshit all the way.  tell the woman to eat a Xanax and quit sniveling.", "Phobias can also be severely debilitating.", "Even if her fear of dogs could be a phobia, I feel like \u201cthing that can kill someone if not taken care of properly\u201d overrules \u201cscared\u201d", "I believe she described a woman who terrified of dogs and cannot relax at all in their presence.  I relate to this as I was attacked by a dog as a child and it took me until my mid-20s to get over that.  I would literally be frozen in fear.  That\u2019s the thing about phobias, they\u2019re not rational, but they are real.", "Surely you can see how mother of the groom > friend of the bride, though? This isn't a case where they can simply tell this woman to be logical and get over the dog being there. The FMIL is absolutely being irrational and ablist and unfair, but if she's going to walk out because there's a dog there no matter what people in comments here argue? Then yeah, I can understand why the decision is the dog can't be there. Yes, that's screwing over a friend to appease the FMIL but the groom wants his mother there and this is the only way for it to happen.", "Someone mentioned allergies, I guess I did not reply to that person but to the OP.", "Yep, my mom trained her own service dog as well.", "A shelter can train animals and make it cheaper than 20,000$. Also she got the dog atleast a decade ago since she was little when she got it. I agree OP story has holes. I would have assumed the OP thought about this before inviting her but now wants to pull drama. Maybe the MIL should meet the dog or OP should see how the dog reacts in public. Does the MIL freak out when a service dog walks down the same sidewalk as her or is in the same store. I'd be pissed and sad if my friend pulled this.", "I have never heard of one being covered by insurance.", "I mean even then I don't think OP is remotely an asshole. She's just trying the only idea that could have any chance at working; there *won't* be dogs at the wedding, or there *won't* be the mother of the groom. Only one of these is a viable suggestion if she wants her friend to go, when it comes down to it.", "I don\u2019t think it\u2019s suck for her to ask to leave the service dog at home one time. There\u2019s no way this girl lived her whole life with a service dog (the dog is only 2 years old), so she knows and has ways to deal with her medical condition without the dog. Not that the dog isn\u2019t a lot better and easier, but it is possible. Friend has been told that she cannot attend with the dog, for valid reasons. Friend has to make the choice of missing the wedding or not. She has no right to make OP feel like an asshole for prioritising a family member of the groom over her friend. It\u2019s a sad situation either way but a choice has to be made. And just to add, friend is allowed to be upset for missing the wedding, but not make her friend feel like an asshole. NAH", "I'm really sorry to hear this. This is mostly why I need a service dog. I was doing OK when I had access to ozempic, but with worldwide shortages still going on and my body trying to get used to it again after 7 months without..... it's been a rough few weeks with lows that hit 3 and highs in the 20s... I wish I didn't have to go through this again, but I guess yay some people lost weight with it", "Idk what it is about medical adhesives but I have the same issue. Some make me rashy/blistery and some seem fine until I go to take it off and it takes my skin with it. \n\nWeirdly enough I\u2019ve found Hockey Tape works better than most medical adhesives and doesn\u2019t cause the same reaction.", "Service dogs are extraordinary", ">Nobody is arguing the dog is a pet.\n\n>this is all a question of margins and who should be accommodated. \n\n>I just don't think she's necessarily an asshole for not wanting her apparently terrified MIL to be subjected to a dog, if there are reasonable alternatives.\n\n\nThis is what she said. You are reaching with your \"she wants to pretend it's just a pet\".\n\nMaybe it happens that there is absolutely no alternative for her friend. If that's the case, she's still not an asshole for saying \"sorry, no dogs\", supporting her husband if he doesn't want the dog at his wedding because it would cause his mom to leave. It just means her friend can't come. Still not an asshole for not inviting someone if their accommodation interferes with the comfort of the groom's mother.", "PTSD from being attacked can be real. She said mil had to get stitches, no real details. My mom had half her lip ripped by a dog, had to wait hours at a ER for a plastic surgeon. Thankfully she was able to love dogs again, but just not that breed.", "not the same as dying from a blood sugar crash.  life saving trumps stupid fear any day.", "And in life, FMIL can go somewhere else. She can't go somewhere else and still be in her son's wedding, though, so she should get priority over the friend.\n\n\"I know it's a service animal, but I have a really bad phobia of dogs.\"\n\n\"Suck it up, who do you think you are? The mother of the groom? The friend is coming, get over it.\"", "Well, you see, going is *optional* for the friend, safety aside. The mother of the groom is pretty important to most weddings, however.", "I'd go further and say it isn't even irrational or ablist to have a phobia of an animal and not want to have to deal with it for an incredibly special event to you and your son. The fact it's a service animal doesn't make it *not* an animal, it's not a simple ablist \"I just don't like dogs, screw your service animal\", even despite what OP said. It's clearly a deeper issue than that.", "Yeah the comment threads tend to take on a life of their own.", "A professionally bred, raised, and trained dog is easily $50k+. The dogs are trained for behaviors and to deal with situations that 99.99%+ of home trainers can\u2019t realistically accomplish. And the 0.01% who can are just rich enough to pay a professional to do it at their homes.\n\nSource: have severe PTSD, hearing, and mobility issues, and a dog from VetDogs who\u2019s a goddamn superhero.", "On top of that, your $2k doesn\u2019t guarantee you\u2019ll get a dog that\u2019s temperamentally suited to being a service dog. Even charitable service dog organizations who\u2019ve been breeding service dogs for 100+ years get whole litters that don\u2019t make the cut.", "Really sorry to hear about you being impacted by a major shortage. Hardly a day goes by without reading *something* about the pro\u2019s/con\u2019s of this \u2018miracle\u2019 weight loss drug, but until supply can be increased enough to accommodate those who\u2019s lives don\u2019t depend on it, they should be reserving it for those whose do.

I'll have to look into that! \n\nI'm naturally very sensitive to allergy / rashes because of mast cell issues but something about the stuff used in the medical field is just awful.

Can you elaborate please? I have never heard this", "nope, we totes believe you!!", "Even band aids have issues for me. I *have* to use the fabric ones because the adhesive on the plastic or foam ones will take my skin too but the adhesive on the fabric ones breaks down on my skin fairly quickly (idk if it\u2019s my sweat or what) and I have to replace my band aid 6x a day it seems like. \n\nI used to just struggle until I met my husband (hockey tape is like his man version of duct tape, he uses it for EVERYTHING) and I was kicking myself for not thinking of it sooner. It\u2019s fabric so it\u2019s still breathable but waterproof, flexible for weird parts of the body, pretty cheap for the size of roll you get, and you can get it in various colors and because I\u2019m a weirdo utilitarian I like that you can use it for an infinite amount of things and not just for taping body parts \ud83d\ude02", "Just realized the commenter was maybe referring to OP when they said \"that person\". I thought they were talking about the contents of the comments they were replying to.\n\nIf that's the case then yes, the OP seems to be attempting to downplay the dogs significance by not using the proper terminology (or correcting themselves when called out, if it was an honest mistake).\n\ntbh there are enough discrepancies to make me believe the whole story is fake. OP is just full of shit imo."]}
