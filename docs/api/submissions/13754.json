It's not going to be a super expensive or crazy wedding because we aren't about that kind of thing (and we're saving for a down payment for our first house), but I am so excited to get to spend the rest of my life with this dork.\n\nThe problem is that my good friend \"Maddie\" \\[26F\\] wants to bring her support dog Hans \\[2M\\]. I like hans. He is really cute and Maddie loves him so much. She got him when he was a puppy because she has diabetes and he can tell when her blood sugar is spiking or something and he keeps snacks in a pouch that he has on his back. I've never seen him do this but she says that he is totally specially trained and she spent 2k on him. She's worked at home pretty much since she got him, so I don't know how well socialized he is and I haven't seen him in a large group of people.\n\nThe thing is that my FMIL \\[52F\\] doesn't like to be around dogs. It's not an allergy, she just had a bad experience with a dog once when she was younger and needed stitches and now she's afraid of them. I've seen her around dogs and she gets really scared and shakey and needs to get away from the dog. She didn't really like me when me and Dan started dating and so I'm really afraid of making her not like me again especially since we live in his home town and my family is 1000 miles away.\n\nMaddie promises me that Hans is really well behaved and won't run at my FMIL and she won't need to be near him at all. She says that she needs Hans because what if she goes into diabetic shock but I told her my FSIL is an ER nurse so she would be okay and my FSIL could be like Hans for the night. Also there are a lot of little kids and Hans is a big dog. I haven't seen him around kids before, so I don't know if he will be okay with them.\n\nI asked Dan if he could talk to his mom but he said that if Hans comes his mom will walk out of the wedding and she's his mom and she should come first. I really want to make Maddie happy because she's one of my best friends here, but when I told her that Hans couldn't come she got really mad at me and accused me of putting my FMIL's \"baby fears\" as she calls them, before her life.\n\nSo reddit, AITA?", "created_utc": 1680387608, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1290ui2/aita_for_not_letting_my_friend_bring_her_support/", "score": 4315, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

So monitoring blood sugars during the wedding is not a suitable alternative.\n\n2nd edit to respond to some comments: \n\nYes, a dog you get as a puppy can be properly trained and certified as a service animal if you invest the time and money.

I like hans. He is really cute and Maddie loves him so much. She got him when he was a puppy because she has diabetes and he can tell when her blood sugar is spiking or something and he keeps snacks in a pouch that he has on his back. I've never seen him do this but she says that he is totally specially trained and she spent 2k on him. She's worked at home pretty much since she got him, so I don't know how well socialized he is and I haven't seen him in a large group of people.\n\nThe thing is that my FMIL \\[52F\\] doesn't like to be around dogs. It's not an allergy, she just had a bad experience with a dog once when she was younger and needed stitches and now she's afraid of them. I've seen her around dogs and she gets really scared and shakey and needs to get away from the dog. She didn't really like me when me and Dan started dating and so I'm really afraid of making her not like me again especially since we live in his home town and my family is 1000 miles away.\n\nMaddie promises me that Hans is really well behaved and won't run at my FMIL and she won't need to be near him at all. She says that she needs Hans because what if she goes into diabetic shock but I told her my FSIL is an ER nurse so she would be okay and my FSIL could be like Hans for the night. Also there are a lot of little kids and Hans is a big dog. I haven't seen him around kids before, so I don't know if he will be okay with them.\n\nI asked Dan if he could talk to his mom but he said that if Hans comes his mom will walk out of the wedding and she's his mom and she should come first. I really want to make Maddie happy because she's one of my best friends here, but when I told her that Hans couldn't come she got really mad at me and accused me of putting my FMIL's \"baby fears\" as she calls them, before her life.\n\nSo reddit, AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

That gives them, and people around them, *real time* information. \n\nEven if she doesn\u2019t have one of those devices, she can *so easily* test her sugar whenever she wants. Diabetes isn\u2019t like having epilepsy. Things don\u2019t just crash and burn within seconds. It takes hours. For that reason, having a dog like that live with you is a great idea to monitor her while she sleeps. But its hardly a necessity for a few hours at a private event. \n\nShe would have more than enough time to notice she was trending into an emergency. And would likely have to bring her insulin and a little sugar with her whether she has the dog or not. She still has to self administer her own care. Whether its take an insulin injection or eat a piece of candy. The dog doesn\u2019t do that for her. \n\nThe dog just prevents her from having to test so frequently. So just making sure she tests at certain intervals throughout the few hours is hardly difficult. She should know her diabetes well enough to know how frequently she has to test.\n\nI worked with tons of diabetic patients. Most only test 1-2 times a day.

Its just an extra safety net to prompt her to test her sugar. Going 3-4 hours without the dog is *hardly* unreasonable in this scenario.", "Testing strips are so cheap.

You described a service dog, which is a highly trained canine that performs certain tasks for their owner. Most, if not all of these dogs, are there to detect and handle medical conditions, such as seizures, blindness, and diabetes. These dogs have to go through special training to behave themselves a specific way in the general public. This is a meticulous process that generally takes the first few YEARS of their life to train for. \nI explain because your friend sounds like she has a service dog, not an emotional support dog. If she has a dog to alert for low blood sugars, that can mean they happen often. If treated before they\u2019re not a big deal, but wait too long and they can become severe quick. Service animals are allowed in non-pet friendly spaces because the owners can\u2019t function without them present, and they\u2019re protected under law as medical devices. \nTo your friend, telling her to leave the dog at home is like telling her to leave her insulin at home. It\u2019s a severe danger to her health, and she feels you don\u2019t give a shit about her health. Your FMIL would only be able to TREAT the emergency (which would be embarrassing, expensive since she\u2019ll have to be hospitalized, and as a diabetic, low blood sugars make you feel like you\u2019re dying), the dog can PREVENT it (by alerting early where she can find some food and an out-of-the-way corner). I understand the rough past of your FMIL but service dogs are specially trained to NEVER bite, even if they themselves are being attacked. People think service dog owners are stuck-up, but they don\u2019t know that those with service dogs can possibly DIE without them. Disinvite your friend\u2019s dog and you will NEVER regain her trust. I think you and friend, then maybe you and FMIL need a sit-down to talk this out. You WILL be TA if you read this post/comment and still disinvite the dog, but it doesn\u2019t sound too late yet.", "more info needed. I watched the documentary on service dogs, they aren't certified and trained as puppies? So she spent $2k on a dog and then had him go through rigorous service training? This sounds slightly sus.

I have to consider my fianc\u00e9 as well, surely his mother being present is more important to him then his fianc\u00e9 friend?", "That\u2019s what I think as well. I don\u2019t think I have ever discussed the cost of my dogs training but I know I\u2019ve told people who have asked how much she cost- because she isn\u2019t a common breed.", "Maybe so, but I\u2019m not going to risk my FMIL throwing a fit and getting all this attention on our wedding day. OP has stated that the relationship is rocky, FMIL could use the service dog as an excuse for OP \u201csecretly hating and plotting against her\u201d lol. Safest bet is to invite FMIL and live stream the wedding for all other guests who can\u2019t attend in person. This women could make her life and marriage miserable, is this really a hill to die on in the grand scheme of things? Also, the fianc\u00e9 has his guest list too. OP should say all of this to her friend so she understands all of what has been considered when making the decision because it will undoubtedly be hurtful to get uninvited.", "I have a busy law practice because people place their moms and dads\u2019 feelings over their spouse\u2019s. Just saying.", "No one has said to disinvite FMIL. And OP had already said FMIL \u201cdoesn\u2019t like her.\u201d That to me says this is likely a pattern of issues that doesn\u2019t end or begin with the dog issue.", "I\u2019m so bewildered by these comments, definitely NTA. It\u2019s also the grooms wedding, of course he wants his mother to be there and be comfortable. It is NOT your friends wedding.\n\nIt\u2019s unfortunate if she can\u2019t attend but I\u2019m so baffled as to why she would even expect you to go to bat over her and her dogs attendance. This is your future family you\u2019re talking about. Sorry to say but you have to prioritize. If she can\u2019t come then she can\u2019t come and don\u2019t lose any sleep over it.", "Sorry, FMIL comes first. She should not have to worry about her fears at her sons wedding. I understand this is an actual medical dog and very important, but if you have talked to both her and the nurse , friend needs to accept no dog for the evening or not come. NTA", "NAH. I\u2019m not sure how everyone here is absolutely CERTAIN this is a trained service dog. It certainly could be a service dog. It\u2019s also possible that it isn\u2019t one, and there is reason to be skeptical as $2000 is far less than these animals cost. \n\nFurther, a diabetes service dog does not replace individual management of diabetes. It is an adjacent support, but does not replace the requirement to monitor nor is it shown to be more accurate or reliable.\n\nFriends explanation \u201cwhat if I go into diabetic shock\u201d doesn\u2019t even make sense. The same thing will happen as if the dog wasn\u2019t there, she will require treatment and the type of assistance any adult could provide. This is not Doggie Howser M.D. Diabetes service dogs are not providing injections or medical interventions.\n\nSo while I have utmost empathy for those with disabilities, and the need to accommodate those who have them, there is enough funny business going on that OP is not an asshole.", "NTA. FMIL is higher on the list than friend. It\u2019s unfortunate but unless she has only been diabetic for 2 years she managed her diabetes before the dog. She can go part of a day.", "NTA \n\nI call bs on the dog being a certified support dog. You don't get them as puppies and they cost a hell of a lot more than $2K.", "NTA\n\nThough MIL needs to deal with this issue. As a full grown woman you think she would be able to put up with this for a day. You have been put between a rock and a hard place I don't envy you. Just be careful that the MIL doesn't start thinking she can keep on bullying you around", "NTA.\n\nSurprised I\u2019m in the minority here, but even if there wasn\u2019t the valid issue that the mother of the groom is petrified of dogs- it\u2019s still your wedding and you get to make that kind of decision whether or not you want animals there, especially large ones. The fact that it\u2019s a large dog too would make it especially noticeable to your MIL. I understand that while the dog has a valid medical purpose, I also can\u2019t help but point out plenty of people manage their diabetes without dogs. I know at least 4 diabetics in my life and not one of them has a dog, one of which was my boss who often works 12+ hour shifts. It\u2019s not like you\u2019re asking her to come to your wedding without insulin, plus you offered your medically trained SIL if god forbid something does happen. I don\u2019t think this is a YTA situation for a second, definitely NTA.", "NTA", "NAH. This isn't about one disability, it's about two. Your FMIL evidently has a phobia of dogs so severe that she would walk out of her child's wedding to avoid one. Maddy has a service dog she relies on physically. Legally speaking, your wedding is a private event and you don't need to accommodate a service dog. Yes, your MIL takes precedence over your friend. You should at least talk to her first, but if she is so involuntarily terrified of dogs that it would ruin the wedding for her, then you need to tell your friend that if she can't attend without her dog, you will understand if she can't attend. But direct family comes first.", "I\u2019m gonna say NAH, but I am gonna say that If you have to worry about whether or not your FMIL *likes* you, I honestly think you have a lot to unpack before you marry your person. \n\nShe is about to be in your life for the rest of your time together. \n\nYou\u2019re willing to sacrifice a friendship with someone who has a serious medical condition because you\u2026want your FMIL to like you? \n\nI think you and FMIL need to have a conversation. Maybe you two are just mismatched personalities, or maybe there\u2019s a misunderstanding somewhere.", "I mean it\u2019s your wedding, do what you want to make you happy, if she has to have her dog, then she doesn\u2019t have to come, not that hard", "I\u2019m actually quite surprised no one is questioning the dog\u2019s legitimacy, considering Reddit seems to hate ESA animals (I know that people abuse this designation and that they\u2019re not the same). It seems to me fairly possible and not that the dog is a legitimate service dog.\n\nMy partner has pretty volatile diabetes (type I - his control is improving, though!). I looked into getting him a DAD (diabetic alert dog), and they certainly cost more than 2K. DADs cost a small fortune unless said friend qualified for a free or reduced-cost dog. But typically, DAD training lasts until the dog is 2-3 years old. Unless she just got him or OP got his age wrong, I kind of doubt that he\u2019s 2 years old and a \u201cfull-blown\u201d DAD, but there\u2019s also the fact that DADs usually do complete their training alongside their owner (as far as I can tell). \n\nPlus, DADs are more so trained to catch lows (hypoglycemia) so if he\u2019s specifically got snacks on his back for low blood sugar reasons, him being a DAD actually sounds plausible. If Maddie\u2019s your best friend, I\u2019m sure you have an idea as to how legitimate he is. I wouldn\u2019t say he\u2019s not just because you\u2019ve never seen her experience a low blood sugar/seen him alert her to one.\n\nIt\u2019s fair if you don\u2019t want your FMIL to be scared at your wedding. That just means your friend can\u2019t come. It must be important to you that she be there, in which case, I don\u2019t envy your position.", "NTA because you gotta do what you gotta do to accommodate your mother-in-law, even if she's being unreasonable.", "NTA\n\nyour wedding your rules. most other occasions i would feel that the service animal should be given priority. but a wedding is not open to everyone and so you can elect to not invite your friend without feeling like TA. \n\nI think your friend is overreacting when she attacks your FMIL by calling them baby fears. Just like her physiological disorder, psychological disorders are also very real and she has no right to put them down. \n\nHowever, I get the sense that you have to pick one or the other here and so you decide. Is you friend more important or your MIL?", "NTA. Diabetics really don\u2019t need a service dog 24/7. She could go a couple of hours and test herself and keep snacks in her purse. She\u2019s not a little kid. If she needs the dog then she can stay at home.", "NAH - you\u2019re trying to do your best but struggling to figure it out, and no wonder.\n\nWhat you have here is essentially a competing needs issue from a disability perspective, and competing needs issues can be brutal. Everything else is clutter, presuming that you believe and trust your friend when she speaks about her training. A well trained service dog is required to be safe around children and crowds; it\u2019s an essential part of their training. So don\u2019t worry about those things unless you believe your friend is a liar.\n\nSo your competing needs issue is: friend with a disability that requires her dog\u2019s presence; MIL with a phobia that requires an absence of dogs. You have to frame it in those terms, and your MIL needs to also be willing to see this as an issue of mutual considerateness and mutual compromise. What creative ideas can you come up with together so that your MIL and beloved friend can both be comfortable-enough at the wedding? Is it a matter of creative seating arrangements? Your friend being there part of the time and not the rest? You won\u2019t find a perfect solution here, but you can find a good-enough solution if your MIL and friend are willing to view each other\u2019s situation, and your care for them both, with compassion and respect.", "In every workplace in the US this dog's service is legally protected. But not at your wedding. She's one of your best friends. YTA. Your MIL needs to grow up. We ALL have trauma and triggers. It's not up to the world to avoid them; it's up to us to cope.", "YTA. He's a service dog. She needs him.", "YTA, but I doubt it'll be an issue since Maddie will hopefully stop being friends with you before the wedding rolls around", "NTA. I\u2019m sure I will be downvoted for this because everyone on Reddit loves dogs (trust me, I do too, I miss them so much), but I have a very unique perspective. \n\nMy daughter has cynophobia (fear of dogs). She\u2019s four and it\u2019s really uncontrollable for her. It sets off her fight, flight, or freeze response immediately. Running obviously makes it worse (the dogs are all good dogs and thinks she wants to play so they chase after her), so it\u2019s that or she freezes and just screams and cries uncontrollably. She\u2019s too small and terrified to fight them. It\u2019s terrible. She climbs up either me or my husband and just shakes in fear. \n\nThey are always good dogs (labs, goldens, all lovable, sweet, good dogs) but none of that reasoning matters. It does not make a single difference to her. It kicks in her survival instinct and it is very hard to shut that off. We are working through it with continued exposure and therapy and medication, but it is very very difficult to overcome. \n\nI feel very bad for everyone involved here. There are many events that we decline because our daughter just can\u2019t handle being around the dogs present and it\u2019s literal torture for her. It sounds like the FMIL deals with her fear by removing herself from the situation, which is perfectly acceptable. Unfortunately she is the mother of the groom and this is also his wedding. If he loves his mother and has a good relationship with her, it\u2019s reasonable that his desire for the woman who gave birth to him and raised him to attend his wedding come before your friend, no matter how close you may be with her.\n\nYour friend is still invited, OP. If she is able to monitor her sugar levels manually without the help of Hans, she should join you on your special day. Maybe she can come to the ceremony and then head home so she\u2019s not without Hans for too long. If her sugar levels drop too unexpectedly and she needs Hans with her to keep her safe, then your friend is allowed to not attend. It is an invitation not a summons.\n\nMaybe the best compromise (other than her attending the ceremony and then dipping our early) since you aren\u2019t having a big wedding is to host a celebratory night out with your friends after the wedding and go to a fun bar for drinks and revelry, that way Maddie can still celebrate with you.\n\nIt\u2019s not ideal. Few things in life ever are. But this is something you will be dealing with as long as your FMIL lives. I love dogs, want a dog, my second oldest daughter has been begging for a dog, but my oldest daughter\u2019s fear is our priority. Our home needs to be her safe space. If you plan on seeing your FMIL regularly, don\u2019t get your hopes on having a dog any time soon.", "NTA.

It definitely sucks for your friend but you\u2019re not an asshole here, regardless of what Reddit thinks.", "NAH, literally I\u2019m shocked by people saying YTA. As many people have said, there are other ways to monitor her levels without her dog, I\u2019m assuming she did that long before she got her dog. MIL comes first no question. Imagine you\u2019re the groom and your partner tells you sorry, but I\u2019m choosing the dog over YOUR LITERAL MOTHER, tell MIL to get over it. If your friend was a good friend, she would understand you needing to chose your family over her dog, again millions of people with diabetes live to survive another day when going to a wedding who don\u2019t have a service dog. Your friend is putting you in a tough position and truthfully she sucks for that.", "NTA. I feel like there are a lot of dog owners or dog lovers who do not understand how crippling a fear of dogs is. A FMIL has a higher priority over a friend because her son is getting married. \n\nOP is in a tough position and the friend needs to understand that her medical condition requires a dog to be present at the wedding.

Meaning you can not legally kick a 'Service Animal' and it's handler out of a building (as long as it is not peeing on everything and being destructive - and a trained Service Animal should not be anyway) while 'Support Animals' are not allowed on many different properties. (Housing situations are different but we are talking about a single event here) Also a train 'Service Animal' is kind of like a living piece of medical equipment (wheelchair service people who need help with mobility, oxygen tanks give service to people who need to breath, Hans alerts when Maddie's diabetes is about to effect her)   \nOkay so knowing ALL of that you are concerned that Hans would not behave around kids or in a large group. HE IS TRAINED! In order to be a 'Service Animal' he would  have to be trained to do his job under many different circumstances. Honestly the kids and other people coming up to pet Hans is more likely a problem than Hans acting up.  \nYour FMIL having a fear of dogs (trauma with dogs) is a problem and one that comes up in business' a lot; where I work we offer reasonable accommodations such as allowing the person with the fear to be in a separate area but we would NEVER kick the person with the 'Service Animal' out. PERIOD!  \nI would say in this instance you might have to make a choice between FMIL and Maddie; if you want Maddie there then Hans is coming. If Hans comes and your FMIL says she'll leave then that is that.   \nPersonally I would tell Dan and FMIL that she doesn't have to interact with Hans but you want your best friend there to support you and for her to be there she needs HER support.", "YTA.
