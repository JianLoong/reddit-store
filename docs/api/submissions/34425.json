He left you dependent on him and blamed you for it. That screwed you over immeasurably. It\u2019s made it difficult to leave him, and if/when you do, will make it difficult to find a high paying job due to the gap in your resume and nine years of raises you never got. He did this on purpose.", "I\u2019m so glad you know this is abuse. It can be so hard to leave\u2026especially when it feels like you can just keep your hurt to yourself in order to keep the \u201cgood times\u201d lasting longer. Then it becomes \u201cyour fault\u201d for bringing things up and it becoming bad. \n\nIt\u2019s not your fault though. In a healthy relationship you would be able to talk through any differences, and he wouldn\u2019t blame you for choosing the \u201cwrong time\u201d to bring them up. \n\nThere are shelters you can stay with your children that will help you get out.

Then get a separate job away from the family business.", "Depending on what state she\u2019s in, his insistence that nothing is hers might garner her some alimony, and he\u2019ll certainly have to pay child support.", "Oof every time I think about our marriage counselor of 3 years, I want to take him to court for emotional duress. Even my abusive husband admits our therapist was just gaslighting me for the money and let my husband get away with so much crap. That guy should have his license revoked.", "Truth!", "And what happens when she does leave and he gets shared custody? Is that her fault too somehow?", "Sometimes people need to hear \"leave your abusive relationship\". \n\nIts not victim blaming. It's a wakeup call", "I am going to politely disagree with you. Yes, it\u2019s hard to leave an abusive relationship, but when you have children, they become the priority. I had to leave with two very small children and no money, but I knew that their health and safety was paramount over my needs even though i knew I needed to leave as well. If i stayed, then i became part of the problem because at that point, I was not doing my due diligence to protect them.

They said these are questions only OP can answer for herself, which is true. My mother had all sorts of options to be able to leave my dad and it didn't matter because she was more invested in proving to her family of origin that she was a big girl who had her own family that was better than theirs. And I had to take a great share of the consequences of a decision I had no part in making.", "Do you have any family in the states you can reach out to? I am sorry for being so blunt with my first post but everything I said was the truth and meant to wake you up. Can you \u201cvisit\u201d any relatives in the state that you were married in? If you can,  file for divorce and don\u2019t go back to South America. If not is there anyone in his family that you trust that could help you?

I'm so sorry.", "It\u2019s a shame you don\u2019t live in Hawaii, because your husband would be prosecuted for coercive control. \n\n But he still could be, as what he\u2019s doing still falls under the category of domestic abuse, regardless of it not being physical", "I voted on the first paragraph, which I can do", "She probably will see his worst if/when she leaves him. I wish I had paid attention when my ex told me he wasn't even on speaking terms with any of his exes. That isn't always a red flag but for me it was a sign of how he'd treat me the moment we broke up, bitter and petty and a huge AH despite me trying me best to be kind and cordial.\n\nPeople who never want to be held accountable get much worse when you leave their ass. They don't want to do any introspection so they just blame the other person and get hostile.\n\nI still think OP should ditch her husband though. He sounds like an abusive narcissist and for me it was better to be poor but free, and deal with him being bitter about the breakup, rather than having to live with that attitude 24/7.", "Don't go to couples therapy with an abuser! They frequently just use what you share to figure out new ways to fuck with you.  I almost did this and I'm so so glad I didn't because after I left I realized he was basically memorizing every vulnerability, insecurity, or whatever else I cared about to use against me when he was angry or wanted money for drugs.

It wasn't until my best friend sat me down and told me how she saw it affecting me that I listened and did something.", "Thank you! OMG I hate how people act like women in relationships can't be brave and take hard risks and conquer. Not every woman who is abused is a mind controlled, fearful thing. Many of us see our kids and that gives us the strength. The enabling sucks it basically says it's ok to risk their happiness and safety.", "Bullcrap.. kids come first and they are being abused. ESH\n\nETA accidentally replied to one comment lower than intended, I totally agree with the one i replied to. Kids come first, protect them!", "Valid points, but in this situation it doesn't seem like the kids are being harmed or are in immediate danger. It's emotional and financial abuse on the mother.

I would like to say that this type of behavior still takes an emotional toll on the kids. Also, this behavior always escalates. I would also like to point out that if mom is constantly on the defensive, depressed, and/or stressed, being emotionally available to the kids always is affected. You become more agitated and on edge. It\u2019s not good for anyone.

It was terrifying but living was terrifying and eventually you roll over and die or make a change. I'm not necessarily advocating for violence but like I said, if a kid is involved, you can find more steel in you than you'd think.", "Should they stay then? \n\nIt isn't simple but when kids are involved choices must be made", "Or...\nThey grew up seeing this kind of abuse and believing it's ok, or people have been telling them they're only victims and are helpless.

We didn\u2019t get along and I like to tell the neighbours what he did behind closed doors. \nIt was harder for my older brother to forgive mum for leaving. Dad had programmed him so well. Honestly I think he was 30 when had his first kid before he realised how bad life was with dad. That you don\u2019t beat women and children.

It was uncomfortable to hear at first, but I\u2019m glad they said what they did. \n\nI genuinely don\u2019t think you can effectively encourage someone to leave an abuser without pointing out the impact on the kids.

Everyone is entitled to their opinion but it seemed very dismissive to me.", "And there are just as many women who shut down and close out what people are saying to them because it just makes them feel angry and defensive. I think people forget that sometimes, that for every story about people who leave, there are probably five more of people who don't. \n\nAnd there are ways to point out impacts on kids without basically yelling at them and putting them down, which is what the top comment is verging on. It feels good to be righteous and get upvotes on reddit, but is it helping OP is another point.", "People tend to think about physical more than emotional impacts, so I assumed that's what they're referring to. Either way I think their point about how people approach this is valid, because comments on here make me cringe sometimes in how impatient, rude and dismissive they are to abuse victims.", "Personally I didn\u2019t think that comment was rude or victim blaming. I understand what you\u2019re saying in general tho, but yelling can work too. Funny enough, it was my sister yelling at me that woke me up.\n\nWe are all different people. We all have different needs and communication styles. As long as no one insulted OP (basically violated the sub rules) then it\u2019s all ok.\n\nAll we can do is give well intended advice and hope for the best, we cannot take responsibility for how or whether other people take it. It\u2019s their life after all.\n\nOP clearly feels something isn\u2019t right in her marriage which is why she made this post, and now an army of internet strangers are trying to help in all their own ways.
