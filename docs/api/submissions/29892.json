Is he usually there for other people in his life and other friends really intensely? Is he a needy kind of person overall? Did your wife ever help him through something? Does he have a lot of other things going on?\n\nI had a lot of very platonic, very close male friends in college based on interests who were great guys, and I can imagine them being there and very present for anyone in that friend group who had a baby out of wanting to be supportive and maybe being a little too dependent on the friend group/wanting to feel needed and useful. Some of them loved chosen family and companionship in that unconventional way and were also neurodivergent (I am too) and did not realize when they were TOO present. Is there a chance of this? It can be sweet and but it also can become very awkward. \n\nDo they seem to have any chemistry/is there any chance he\u2019s her type?! Is there a chance she is only his?

We were all a little needy and very communal. I\u2019ve seen a lot of instances of awkward people showing care in clumsy and too intense ways. I think we need more details on their past friendship.\n\nI definitely think OP is NTA for being annoyed, especially with her leaving with Dan. But I would need to know more than we do now to judge if it\u2019s likely a cheating situation.", "When you all have family time? They are a family that lives together anytime can be family time it shouldn't need to be scheduled. What should be scheduled is visitors. I don't agree with anybody having an open door policy unless it is agreed by both husband and wife. Both me and my partner are luckily in agreement with this \n, I don't want any of his friends turning up with out at least a bit of notice when I'm hanging out in my pyjamas and he doesn't want my family turning up any time when he is working from home etc. \n\nSounds like the friend is having a bit too much fun playing daddy and wife is condoning and even encouraging it. OPs feelings should take priority to his wife over her friend, as her partner and as their baby's parent.", ">YTA. Apparently your wife expects to be a participant in the decision as to when you all have Family Time?  \n>  \n>I get what you want. But, you were high handed and rude to her friend. That part wasn't cool. So, I get why she's PO'd.\n\nI see where you're coming from, and you've got a point. I admit I might have been a bit high-handed with Dan, and that wasn't cool. I should have discussed it with my wife and found a better way to handle the situation. Communication is key, and I'll work on that.", "If my SO had a friend (male or female) who came to our house every weekend after I had a baby, I would have kicked the friend out myself, and my SO as well if he didn\u2019t establish boundaries.\n\nYou are NTA, and frankly, you have been a LOT more patient and accepting that your wife has any right to ask of you.", "Are you sure it isn't his baby?\n\nNTA btw", "I can understand how you are feeling.  So many visits from anyone would be overwhelming.  Does Dan not have any other friends or any hobbies?", "NTA your wife is . Get her to couples counseling and tell Dan he can only come over whe he is invited but BOTH OF YOU", "I think you need to ask the question is the baby mine as dan seems obsessed with spending alot of time with them and your wife. It might be innocent but i would want to know.", "NTA - is baby maybe Dans baby ???", "From what I've seen, it's best to get a therapist involved before things escalate and even more issues arise. I genuinely hope she begins listening to you and learns that the family unit should come before all else. When that is understood and agreed upon, I'm sure you both will find common ground that keeps everyone happy. I wish you and yours the best!!", "Sarah needs to understand that you are entitled to bond with your baby and that your role as the baby\u2019s father isn\u2019t to be pushed aside so Dan can play \u2018Daddy\u2019. Would Sarah like it if you brought a woman home and insisted Sarah take a back seat and watch some other woman be the mother to her child?", "So ridiculous, people on Reddit think everyones cheating. Doing a dna test will likely be the beginning of the end of your marriage.", "> 've been feeling a bit skeptical\n\nStop rationalizing. You need to be more than \"a bit\" skeptical, because all of this is extremely weird and lined with huge red flags.", "NTA. Listen to your gut. Instincts, intuition, intrusive thoughts are there for a reason.\n\nDiscuss boundaries with your wife. If she is resistant, you will need to obtain a DNA test. Be ready for either result. \n\nWanting privacy with your small family is completely reasonable and rational. If Dan needs to be there EVERY weekend, and your privacy requests are ignored, or as you describe, create friction between you and your wife, then you really need to look long and hard at the relationship and how the dynamics between your wife and Dan are operating.\n\n**Does Dan come over when you are NOT home?** Him being there \"to help and offer parenting advice\" is awkward at the best and suspicious at worst. \n\nSorry for this situation, but reading it as an total stranger makes me see red flags everywhere.", "No family but he has a wife and kid", "no offense but you tried to talk with your wife, but she still went against you talking is not working\n\nshe chose dan over talking to you\n\ni get you love her but she is having dan in your home playing daddy when you are not there\n\nshe can lie and say nothings going on and you might believe her, but if down the road it comes out then the child will suffer.\n\nyou need to get a dna test her and dan are not going to change", ">Talking with my wife and working out a plan for Dan's visits sounds like a good idea\n\nDo this. Its difficult being in a relationship with a woman who has a child with another man AND the baby-daddy just pops in at his leisure.\n\nScheduled visitation seems like a good idea..\n\nBut remember its important he gets to see his child and establish a relationship early, so try not to get in his way.\n\n[Yes, sarcasm!!  Open your eyes!!! Do paternity test NOW!!]", "Your wife leaving WITH Dan after you argued is really troublesome. Dan should have immediately left your home when you and your wife argued about him being there.\n\nThere is more between them than they are letting on. When did she return? Did Dan bring her home?\n\nSo much questionable behavior here.", "I agree with the NAH verdict (at this stage). You've also got to consider that while for you, you're at work all week and so are looking forward to family time, your wife is at home with the baby all week and is probably desperate for a bit of adult conversation and contact with the world outside the home bubble. It's likely that as far as he knows, his visits are welcome and helpful. In fact, loads of new parents complain about being cut off from their friends groups and feeling isolated, so perhaps he's trying to be conscientious and not do that. \n\nI don't think you're an AH for being annoyed with his presence, but I also don't think this situation is screaming cheating the way others seem to. Or that he or your wife are being AH either. I think just chat with your wife a bit more and ask if you can find a compromise, eg every other weekend and for a shorter visit.", "And if he is offering parenting advice, then does he have children at home that he is neglecting?", "It sounds like she is putting family first: baby daddy > husband.", "The wife literally ran of with the guy and baby cause OP wanted to spend quality time alone with her and the baby.\n\nIf that is not the grounds to be suspicous what is? It's not like OP just went \"You have a close male friend, so I am accusing you of cheating and demanding a paternity test.\"", "Well to be honest the dude is spending way more time then normal with the wife and child.   How many single guys you know want to spend their every weekend hanging out with a baby?  Hmmm", "Dude this guy made a completely reasonable request and his wife literally ran off with the other guy.\n\nPeople on reddit will call men insecure and controlling right up until they walk in on her cheating.", "Lol this ship has sailed. The end of this marriage has already begun a long time ago.", "I can\u2019t speak for others but what feels off is that Sarah left with Dan. If my husband got upset about someone being at our house constantly, my first reaction would be to ask my friend to please leave and give us space, so we can sort it out. (Not gonna lie and pretend to be perfect: I would then maybe yell at my husband/ go for a walk). But leaving with Dan is Sarah saying to OP: I pick him, over you and my family. That\u2019s just a way to doom her relationship. \n\nEdit: unless of course as others are implying, she has picked the father of her baby and family over OP", "Honestly, it sounds like their marriage doesnt last long anyways"]}
