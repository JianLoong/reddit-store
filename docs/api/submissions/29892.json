Does he have a lot of other things going on?\n\nI had a lot of very platonic, very close male friends in college based on interests who were great guys, and I can imagine them being there and very present for anyone in that friend group who had a baby out of wanting to be supportive and maybe being a little too dependent on the friend group/wanting to feel needed and useful. Some of them loved chosen family and companionship in that unconventional way and were also neurodivergent (I am too) and did not realize when they were TOO present. Is there a chance of this? It can be sweet and but it also can become very awkward. \n\nDo they seem to have any chemistry/is there any chance he\u2019s her type?! Is there a chance she is only his?

This unfortunately sounds like a situation that is still developing and as such far too much information is missing and not available. Sadly your wife is going to be on the defensive automatically no matter what you do, unless you back off and let her play happy families with her supposed good friend and child. My first thought is that you sit down with her alone (no family, no friends good or otherwise) and ask her two questions followed by how you are feeling about the situation: in a serious and committed relationship who is most important? SO/children (immediate family), extended family (parents/siblings/etc.), or friends (good or otherwise)? Once she answers (hopefully with the SO/children answer), then you tell her that while you appreciate she has a close friendship with Dan you are feeling like she has elevated Dan into the SO role and father of the baby and relegated you into the role of friend, and not even good friend. Tell her that it irks you to even think that she is having an affair and that the baby may not be yours, but her behavior has unfortunately allowed those thoughts to creep in. From there, tell her that for both your sakes you two really need to be in couples therapy. Remind her that while you have time to bond with her and the baby during the week, the weekends are the only time you really have available for full bonding as a family yet you are being denied that by her lack of ability to set boundaries with others and support you. Tell her you will give her a few days to calmly process what you have said, and if after a few days she is still on the defensive tell her that she has not helped the situation and sadly you are going to have to request a dna test for your own peace of mind. You could also take a somewhat nuclear track and request the dna test while Dan is there while also doing this: take off the wedding band and put it in the middle of the table \u201cI feel as if I am being used to cover up a long standing relationship that no one else agreed with. I didn\u2019t sign up to be the third wheel or the covering husband. While I would love nothing more than to have this ring returned to my hand, you (Sarah) need to choose who is your actual husband and who is merely your friend. Either way, I am going to have to request a DNA test on baby even though the thought my wife has been having an affair is abhorrent to me and I desperately hope that a potential affair is not actually truth.\u201d", "NTA.

I had no bad intentions at all, I was just unconsciously trying to build a surrogate bond with another child because I didn't have a bond with my young nieces at the time. \n\nFirst you need to speak to your wife and explain your boundaries.

Like he's not part of that baby's upbringing nor is he responsible for any future needs.  Even uncles and grandparents aren't *that* involved and even in non-nuclear families, it's usually close families where you want them to say 'nana'.  Not random ass Dan.", "Maybe there's something dodgy going on here, maybe there's something innocent, maybe it's crossed wires. You've had a ton of 'DNA test', 'marriage is doomed' messages, so I'll bypass the dodgy option.\n\nSomething innocent. Maybe... Dan?... the friend is lonely, doesn't have a lot of friends or the skills/confidence to make more. Your home and your family are a safe place for him to be, with (he thinks) no pressure, no awkwardness, no expectations, nothing but acceptance, warmth, and fun times. Maybe there's something going on - ASD, anxiety, relationship/work/health issues that you don't know about.\n\nWhether it's that or just crossed wires from different, unspoken expectations, you and your wife need to sit down and talk, really talk. Give her a heads up so she can be focussed - \"Hey baby, things didn't go down right the other day when your friend was here, and we probably should talk about it. When I get home from work tomorrow, let's walk down to (takeout restaurant), grab some food, and chat while we walk. I'm upset, I can see you are, and I imagine he I'd, and none of that makes me feel good.\" Then do what you can before bed tonight, and before work tonight to make sure you two can leave the house without that becoming a point of stress (for example, after a hectic weekend ending in injury for me, if my husband had suggested last night that we go put today I would have cried. 4 loads of laundry to fold, 2 days of dirty dishes and a pantry that looked...well, like I'd had to run out mid baking and our teen took over, leaving batter and ingredients splattered on every surface inside and outside the pantry. Leaving the house OR staying hone for a serious talk would have both been unthinkable options!).\n\nIs it reasonable for the three of you to have time alone together? Nope. Is it unreasonable for you to expect your wife's friend to suddenly stop coming over? Yep. With my first baby, I kept up my busy, social-butterfly life, going out wherever and whenever I could. Sometimes, I'd bail after an hour, sometimes I wouldn't make it at all, but my friends understood, and for my sanity I needed to still feel like 'me'. My baby slept anywhere, was happy in the car, being handed around...she was enveloped in love. For my second, we were home a lot more, but still quite social. If I was to have a third, we'd probably be hone, just with the family, most of the time. \n\nWhat does your wife want/need/expect? What do you want/need/expect? Is this really about bonding for you, or is there something else going on? Are you jealous of this guy? Do you feel like you don't know your wife anymore now that she's a mother? Are you struggling to adapt to fatherhood or to bond with your baby? All of these are real and valid, but if you just mask it with 'Family Bonding', then any actual needs will go unmet. Same with your wife - she may be struggling to bond, feel like she isn't a good enough mother or wife, feel like everything is 100% about the baby and she's losing her sense of self, and her friend's presence masks, or makes up for her perceived shortcomings.\n\nTalk about these things calmly, neutrally. Approach it as a problem you two need to solve together. Remind yourself, and your wife, that you're in this together. You're a team, you bring to the table your own skills and experiences, and together you can work out the best solution, leaning into love, understanding and acceptance, compromises and brave honesty - which you will accept with empathy and kindness. It's not you against your wife, not you against her friend, not you and your wife against the friend. It's your wife and you against the current situation, and out of all of the many possible solutions, you two are going to find the best ones. \n\nList the solutions - the friend moves in, and you two go out for margaritas every night while he babysits! You buy him one-way tickets to Kenya! You set him up with your neighbour - or your workmate who's soon moving to Jamaica and you'd love to have an excuse for free accommodation there....You find him a weekend job...You charge him $1 for every minute he's there.... you get him to do the yardwork, clean the garage, service the car - fold the laundry and wipe the skirting boards...any and everything, said light heartedly, not meanly. I tell my family there are no bad ideas, and sometimes they push that so hard I have to add, \"but some we will never, ever, choose.\" After you've laid out every zany idea, the sane ones will become more obvious. Maybe him moving to Jamaica would actually make you sad. Maybe him moving in would freak out his wife. Maybe you find a compromise that he cones for one day a weekend, and you three are alone the other. Remember, whatever the reason he's there all the time, cutting him off cold turkey will probably be quite cruel to him, and not be that good for his mental well-being....possibly leading to him being more dependent on your wife.\n\nIt's so hard, but not un-solvable. You just need to be honest, humble, kind, a team player, and a sense of humour helps. Hopefully, your wife can be the same, and the four of you are soon having fun again.

It took a lot of communication and respectful discussion between Howard and Bernadette, and then the two of them with Raj.\n\nBest of luck!\n\n\nCongratulations on the new baby!", "Sounds like it's Sarah & Dan's baby based on how you have described the situation...", "The advice is to go to a family therapist or if your wife is a church goer, a minister.

Sarah is married to you, not Dan.  And Dan is not her child.  I understand that Sarah and Dan have been friends for a long time.  But Sarah has a family now and that must be her #1 priority.

Personally I would need to have a conversation in why this guy feels so comfortable to interject on a family he isn\u2019t a part of, unless of course he thinks he might be a part of it?  I.e. sees OPs wife as his or the baby as his.  NTA but further follow up is required here", "NTA.  \"Sarah and Dan went out.\"  Are you kidding me?  You need to wake up.  And never ever believe it when your girl/wife says \"oh he's just a friend.\"  Another thing to really think about.  Are you sure the baby is yours?  DNA test?  You'll be damned if you do and damned if you don't.  Good luck.", "Just a question, other than Dan does your wife talk/hang out with a lot of friends since the baby? He might be part of her pre-baby life that she wants to keep so that she doesn't lose herself to motherhood. A lot of us mom's sacrifice a lot, seemingly more than husbands, so it's nice to have that friend that can come by, help out, let you vent and remind you you can have some semblance of a social life other than baby.", "NTA. You don't have to entertain visitors if you're not in the mood to. While it's kind of him to come over to help, if it's unwanted, it feels like a nuisance. With it being every weekend, I would consider it a nuisance, too. My husband liked being needed when we had our babies, I wonder if maybe you are also feeling like Dan is taking the wind from your sails. If your wife needs help, you should be the first one she turns to, and him inserting himself in that way is also taking away your role as a father. \n\nThat's not cool your wife keeps defending Dan's presence, though. It's too bad it boiled over the way it did, but it isn't that surprising. You tried bringing it up before and she dismissed your communication efforts, but that doesn't mean the issue disappeared. Hopefully Dan will think about visiting less frequently and you and your wife can discuss this better to find a solution that doesn't permanently damage any relationships here. But truly, the relationship between you and your wife and you and your child is miles more important than her relationship with Dan.

You present a united front, then you can have a chat in private to tell them you think they were wrong and ensure there\u2019s an agreement on the way forward. \n\nI would ask your wife if she really wants to stay married to you, and why she even married you in the first place if all she wants is spend time with her friend.\n\nNTA on the entire thing by the way\u2026", "NTA!

Maybe Dan comes over on Saturdays but not Sundays. Maybe you set a time he can\u2019t join you guys before, or a time he needs to clear out by.

Granted, she doesn't have any close male friends like that and I would not allow it even if she did, not that close anyway.
