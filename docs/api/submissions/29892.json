Does he have a lot of other things going on?\n\nI had a lot of very platonic, very close male friends in college based on interests who were great guys, and I can imagine them being there and very present for anyone in that friend group who had a baby out of wanting to be supportive and maybe being a little too dependent on the friend group/wanting to feel needed and useful. Some of them loved chosen family and companionship in that unconventional way and were also neurodivergent (I am too) and did not realize when they were TOO present. Is there a chance of this? It can be sweet and but it also can become very awkward. \n\nDo they seem to have any chemistry/is there any chance he\u2019s her type?! Is there a chance she is only his?

We don't really know what is rattling around in her head but her behavior suggests that Dan is her priority.", "I just want to say I think your rule for your shared home is fantastic to have and to have clearly defined and decided between you both. My husband & I have a similar viewpoint about home being **our** safe space but we were never as clear about it as you have been. I think that's awesome.\n\nHave a lovely day!", "He already communicated to her previously.  \nShe cares more for the opinion of this guy and the feelings of her own husband, alleged father of her child.  \nShe is an AH and the dude shouldnt just ask her if she is comfortable.   \nIts OP's house too and you need two YES to confirm and only one NO to deny.", "Her 'friend' is rude.", "r/PettyRevenge - this is the answer.", "Sounds like Dan is trying to make your baby and wife his.", "Buddy. That\u2019s just coping. But an end to this and get a paternity test.", "Sounds like your wife is having an affair and hat their is a huge possibility that this baby isn't yours and is actually Dan's. \n\nIf it wasn't Dan's, then it would be extremely weird for him to be over constantly. \n\nI'm like 99.9% sure it's Dan's and he's over all the time when yournot home to spending with his kid. \n\nI'll be super surprised if I'm wrong. \n\nYou should get a DNA test done.", "Idk man, sounds like he's trying to get bonding time with his baby.", "Does Dan not have a life outside of your wife??\n\nLike surely he has more important things to do on the weekends.", "Mate, if this isn't rage bait, you need to open your eyes.\n\nYou asked for help, because Dan is pushing you out of your own marriage and newborn's life.\n\nDo not just \"keep it in mind\" and \"might consider\" the therapist and the DNA test. Those are the first steps you have to take to resolve this. \n\nBecause talking did not help. There is nothing else you can do.\n\nYank your head out of your butt.\n\nAgain, unless this is just rage bait, which seems more and more likely with every wishy-washy reply you give.", "well unless it is dan's baby. male friends are one thing. male friends that push out the real dad are a whole other can of worms", "It doesn't matter how much Dan wants to be a dad he cant use your family as a simulation of the life he wants to have.", "DNA test now. This is hurtful and your wife doesn\u2019t care. You don\u2019t need to tell her. If the kid is yours then counseling and if not you know what to do. \n\nYou are being pushed out of your own family and your wife is allowing it. Can you take baby alone for a few hours by yourself?  Take a walk, go to a park, mall etc?\n\nThis is hurting you and it will get worse. She is alienating you. Do not allow it or you will have big problems down the road.", "You're getting a lot of people suggesting a DNA test, which it's your choice or not if you want to push for one. Just remember that if it comes out to be your kid you could blow your marriage up over the distrust, she'd feel hurt that you don't trust her and I doubt you'd still feel all that confident that she's not cheating. Counseling is probably the best way to go.", "It would be a bigger concern if he was coming over when you aren\u2019t around.", "I would get the DNA test done before you say anything \n\nThat way you have that peace of mind and don't accuse of her of something if the baby is yours. \n\nDNA test first, confront second.", "Just a side thing, NTA btw, you can get the DNA test done without asking your wife about it.  There are swab DNA tests, swab your cheek swab baby\u2019s cheek and send it off.  Might be a bit easier than convincing your wife about it, and it\u2019ll give yourself a bit of piece of mind", "Honestly, once that seed is planted in your head, it\u2019s best just to quietly get the test. It doesn\u2019t need to be a big production - just send off a sample from your baby and yourself. I would never mention it unless it shows that it\u2019s not your child.", "No you should do it now", "Dude, I am the wife with the male best friend that comes over constantly. \n\nI am laughing at all these DNA test comments.\n\nI understand your struggle  my husband had a similar reaction and oddly I went through a period of being annoyed at my BFFs presence like 15 years after my first child was born.\n\nEveryone's intentions are good, the help is wonderful to have, but it does interrupt the family dynamic. \n\nYou aren't the AH but you don't need a DNA test.. the relationship isn't *that* weird.", "Dude, listen to people here. There\u2019s a difference between a \u201cunique\u201d situation and a deeply unusual one where your wife seems to be prioritizing the feelings of this dude over her own husband.\n\nI\u2019m not saying Dan needs to be excised from your life, but I would be super weirded out by a non-family member spending THIS MUCH time with my newborn child, and offering advice which he isn\u2019t really entitled to give. A parent or in law probably gets a few free passes at parenting advice since they\u2019ve done it before, I\u2019d be inclined to be far less tolerant of someone who is already encroaching on an extremely important bonding time for myself, my child and my wife. \n\nYou need to have a come to Jesus talk with your wife. If you don\u2019t, I\u2019d bet my bottom dollar that this becomes a cataclysmic issue in your marriage.", "this isnt unique at all its common actually", "You can discretely do the test from home thru \u201c23andme\u201d that you can purchase at most large retailers. She doesn\u2019t even have to know about it.", "I'm hoping it's the wrong message =(", "Dude, take your head out of the sand....\n\nAt this point you're starting to get into \"you're being taken advantage and you deserve it\" territory.  Do the mail-in paternity test.  Don't tell your wife until you get the results back.", "The problem is she\u2019s going to lie to you or gaslight you. I think the main concern here is the child. You can do a DNA test without her if the\n child is yours then counseling. But this is going to eat at you. It sounds like she wants him to be the father and a husband. How long are you gonna allow this to happen? If you decide to do nothing she\u2019s going to push the boundaries.", "Wake up my man.  \nDan knows what he is doing 100%.  \nEven if he doesnt know if you see that your friend is arguing with their partner because of you you just dont take them out, you let them solve their differences.  \nHe is trying to sabotage your relationship, the problem here is your wife that seems not to care about your relationship anymore.", "What does Dan actually do when he's there on weekends? Other than playing with the baby and offering unsolicited advice?\n\nDoes he do any cooking, cleaning, dishes, laundry, yard work, etc.? Anything that would allow you as the actual parents to spend more time with your infant and/or each other?\n\nI ask because if all he's doing is what yiu mentioned, I have trouble seeing how that is really that much help. I mean sure, someone's got to be watching/holding/playing with the baby when they're not asleep. But I know, as a parent, I would have been pissed if someone was swooping in every weekend and taking over the time with my kids as infants (or even older ages).\n\nOn the advice thing, he's not a parent. Does he have some other qualification for giving infant care advice? Oldest kid with a bunch of younger siblings? ECE degree? Works in childcare? Stays at Holiday Inn Express frequently?\n\nA large portion of late 20-somethings without any of the above probably have no clue on infant care.\n\nI know I didn't. I was still pretty clueless in my mid30s when my first was born. I was very appreciative that my wife had been babysitting since she was a teen, and worked in ECE (with a degree to match), and that she was able to guide and teach me what I do know. Even then, I wouldn't be trying to give infant care advice to other parents.\n\nAnd what sort of advice is he even giving? Do we even want to know?", "And in the crazy world of AITA, Dan and OP's mom would probably hook up and Dan would become OP's stepfather and insist that their child call him Grandpa.", "Sounds like they already are his.", "My thought too.", "DNA test. Heavy duty marital counseling. Dan is in love with OP's wife and maybe vice verse.", "What the actual fuck????", "if you put it like that, their situation is really fucking weird tbh, not bad intended to\n OP", "If he tells his wife he wants a paternity test, it'll likely end the marriage. Once this kind of mistrust is out in the open, it can't be regained.", "Being sneaky about something like that is asking for trouble. The wife would be only one piece of opened mail away from finding out her husband thinks he might have cheated on him.", "I mean, she LEFT with the other guy after having an argument regarding boundaries with her husband.  I'm not saying she's cheating, but come on! That's extremely weird, don't you think?", "Doing a DNA test after his wife ran off with another man because OP said he wanted bonding time with his own wife and child. If my partner got upset with ME for wanting to have bonding time with just my partner and baby and taking someone who keeps intruding on family bonding time and then left the house with them after I said I wanted family time, that would be the beginning of the end of the marriage. A DNA test would then become collecting evidence.", "I\u2019m not big on the DNA testing stuff, but in this case I would suggest one. Dan\u2019s involvement in the child-rearing is over the top, and the wife\u2019s adamant defense of him staying involved points to the idea that it is possibly his child.", "Why they spend more time with baby than the father does-something is up", "Seeing the situation op describes, even if the child is his, it might be out of sheer luck, and not because his wife is not cheating. She is emotionally cheating for sure. The paternity test is for his peace of mind and for not be saddled with giving childcare money to people that betrayed him.", "This marriage is already taking its last gasps as long as Dan is bonding with OP 's child.", "It was for mine....(female)", "I'm too old to have hope like that. If it walks like a duck and talks like a duck...", "\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "Oh God Damnit...", "I love everything about it\u2026", "Yeah, especially since they all left the house together and OP was on his own, what the heck?", "yeah definitely, since she chose to side with the mister instead of her husband.", "Maybe not in love.\n\nBut I'd absolutely get a DNA test because I'm seeing red flags galore...", "That\u2019s why it\u2019s best to just do the test quietly and privately. I think that your average person would agree that it\u2019s warranted and would do it in his shoes. But still, I think getting the result first and confronting the problem only if it\u2019s a problem is the way to go.", "He should do it without telling her.", "Yup! Finally a voice of sanity. Sarah needs to circle up with OP.", "Exactly. Perfect.", "Also old but stupidly optimistic with it.", "Yall are displaying some seriously unhinged advice here. Op if you demand a paternity test based on nothing more than the fact that you wife having a friend, she truly might divorce you.", "I agree he should get the test but let's be honest here, if you are sneaking to get a paternity test there are some serious relationship problems already.", "Even a secret paternity test can end a marriage, if it ever comes out. OP better be prepared to take that secret to the grave, if the kid is his.", "If there truly wasn't any cheating the want for a paternity test could be a problem whether it's done in secrecy or talked about before hand. It's a sign that he doesn't trust his wife. If he does it without talking to her and it comes out that the kid is his and he did a test without her knowledge that'd be a huge problem for them to over come. Not to mention the test wouldn't confirm or deny cheating if the kid is still his, someone could cheat and still get lucky enough to have the right fathers DNA with their child.", "You are better than I.", "Wife is prioritizing the feelings of her friend over her husband, so yeah, there are serious problems already.", "It's not necessarily a good quality. But it's baked in, I can\u2019t change it."]}
