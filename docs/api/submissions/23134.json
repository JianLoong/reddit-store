I've worked really hard on my garden for the past 5 years and I'm really proud of it. \n\nI've noticed this year though that my garden hasn't had quite the yield it has in the past. I at first blamed it on our recent weather. But then I started to notice that it looks like someone, or something, had been in my plants. A couple things were knocked over, the soil was more compact, a few things had been moved. I set up some trail cams to maybe see if I had foxes or raccoons (which are frequent visitors, must to the disapproval of my dogs). \n\nWell after a couple of nights, I saw our neighbors walking through my lawn and helping themselves to the vegetables. I was pretty taken back. I don't know them well but we wave at each other when we see each other. But definitely not enough that they should think they have the right to come over and help themselves.\n\nI saw them outside the next day, and went over to talk to them. I just said \"Hey I noticed that you guys were taking some of my vegetables. Unfortunately that's food my husband and I really depend on, so I really need you to stop.\" They at first got indignant, but I told them I had them on camera. The conversation ended on a sour note but I thought we had reached a conclusion. \n\nUntil I checked my cameras again and saw them AGAIN. The first thing I did was install locks on the insides of my fence so they couldn't get in, but then I took the footage to the police. I told them I didn't want them charged with anything, but that I had already told them they couldn't do that and it was ignored, and I wanted a paper trail. \n\nWell I saw an officer at their door the next day. After he left, the woman came outside and started screaming at the house that they were hungry and had kids to feed and she couldn't believe I called the police.

We had this going on in my neighborhood in what I dubbed, \u201cThe Case of the Purloined Produce.\u201d  It took getting the police involved before the offenders (two elderly women who pretended they couldn\u2019t speak or understand English) stopped.", "I miss the stories about the bucket lady. I wish there were more of them.", "The Bucket Lady thread is solid gold.", "I am so tired of people using their kids to excuse their own behavior!\n\nYour kids are your kids! No one else's!

A little late for this year, but the planning can start now.", "I would rather you steal money from me than steal my produce. The money took less effort to earn. \n\nWe sometimes get people dropping by and asking if they can pick our fruit. I get why because there are a lot of people in our area who don\u2019t have time to do anything with their fruit trees, and asking is infinitely better than stealing. But those trees are our *babies*. I am NOT giving the fruit away after I slaved the whole summer pruning, thinning, and spraying those trees.

Is there any way I could help with the garden or do some chores in return for some vegetables?\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEither they were lying in the first place, which is likely, or their pride is so vast they'd rather hurt people in secret than ask for help in public, which makes them bad people.", "Our three large and not particularly friendly dogs are probably what's stopping them from checking the doors while we're gone.", "I 100% would be checking to see what else is missing, it seems unlikely they would stop at vegetables.", "Oh my gosh. That made me laugh out loud. Thank you.", "I would have happily given her some of our preserved seeds if she asked. To be honest I'm not even sure how they knew we had a garden.

There is so much more to it than sticking seeds in the ground and watering them and it has taken me years to finally get it right. \n\nI say that now because I have huge pumpkin vines and tall corn stalks but I haven't actually had anything reach the point of being harvestable yet so I may very well be speaking too soon. There's still so many things that can go wrong.", "They do. I think they have three but it's possible the wife is pregnant again. Obviously I'm not going to ask her.", "You know, if they'd been my neighbours and I could grow a garden (unless dandelions count, you're out of luck), I'd be glad to help out. I couldn't be responsible for your entire care and feeding, but I'd be glad to donate. It's the stealing that bothers me.", "Eh. I'm not a very good or patient teacher and honestly I just don't have a lot of time.", "OP said they didn\u2019t want them charged, not they didn\u2019t want them to be spoken to about this.", "We have some insanely crafty squirrels. It's actually kind of amazing. I've seen them just pluck shit off the vine in the same way a human would. If they weren't such a nuisance I'd be in awe. Well actually I still am a bit in aw.", "Well I don't think it's particularly neighborly to steal from your neighbors either....

As a reward.\n\nInstead of have the audacity, to think, that  between neighbor, may be they could ask direclty if they can have some ? To help ? And if not possible, some advice to do the same on their own garden ?\n\nNaaaaaah ! The second option is not reasonable.. To expect some respect and friendliness... It is crazy !\n\nJoke appart, BIG NTA !  \nYou can't carry on your shoulder all the weight from the world.   \nYou did right. You didn't press charge. It was a kind warning after a heated conversation.", "I also want something else out: the potential for liability.\n\nI am not sure what the law states where you are, but it is possible that they could be placing you at risk of liability if they trespass on your land and get injured there.\n\nYou may want advice on this.", "The neighbors don't want to do the work to grow their own food. They want OP to do the work, and let them help themselves to her produce for free.", "Haha. Maybe I should put a tip jar in the garden.", "To be honest I don't know how their yard is set up.

But thank you!", "follow up with the police and ask them to trespass them. they will serve them with paperwork, a warning to stay off of your property. if they trespass again then they can be arrested, if you choose to pursue it. but a formal trespass is usually the first step (at least it is in Texas).", "I recall the sprinklers can be timed thus maximize your options.", "There are also some that have a night setting that only responds to the infrared camera\u2014we use one of those on our garden because if I have to turn it off I forget to reset it, but with the night setting it doesn\u2019t go off as long as it\u2019s light outside.", "Read the saga of the [Bucket Woman](https://www.reddit.com/r/BestofRedditorUpdates/comments/12ok9s0/the_bucket_woman_vs_oops_bins_continues/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ioscss&utm_content=2&utm_term=1); it will at least put a smile on your face.

I haven't seen them since that last time.", "eta: NTA. they are ridiculous.", "And Ontario Canada", "Oh jeeze. I said, theft is theft. I was just pointing out that not all things can come from the food bank. And our food bank only had canned peaches or applesauce, which they often were out of. Plenty of corned beef hash though.", "While that is fair, there\u2019s also the consideration that maybe when they had the kids they were in an okay spot financially and then fell on hard times later, making it difficult to feed them. \n\nI\u2019m not excusing these neighbours\u2019 behaviour at all, they are definitely wrong to be stealing and should be stopped, but I just want to point out that you can go from being in a stable situation to suddenly not.", "How about we advocate for a society where people are paid a living wage rather than determine who is worthy/not wprthy of procreating.", "Heck, OP might\u2019ve even been willing to help a little, at least give some tips and such if the neighbours had asked how to start their own garden, rather than stealing.", "I made a compost bin from 4 pallets that I got for free and screwed together.

You might be on to something.", "Or sabotage the garden somehow.", "So you're saying every parent should have 18 years of living expenses saved before they have children?\n\nThat or rich parents...  \n\nnothing in life is certain.  The solution is not for only rich people to have children.  The solution is a society with a livable minimum wage, etc, etc.", "I actually have really nice neighbours. I was putting myself in your shoes!", "I'd just like to ask, if you lost your source of income would it take you 18 years to get another? I don't think you should have 18 years worth of funds, but you should definitely be able to guarantee the safety of the child. \n\nI also believe in a liveable minimum wage, but that doesn't mean people will make good decisions or even get a job before they have children. My parents had a good enough income  to raise 2 children on but through their own bad decisions they fucked it up."]}
