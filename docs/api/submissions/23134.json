I've worked really hard on my garden for the past 5 years and I'm really proud of it. \n\nI've noticed this year though that my garden hasn't had quite the yield it has in the past. I at first blamed it on our recent weather. But then I started to notice that it looks like someone, or something, had been in my plants. A couple things were knocked over, the soil was more compact, a few things had been moved. I set up some trail cams to maybe see if I had foxes or raccoons (which are frequent visitors, must to the disapproval of my dogs). \n\nWell after a couple of nights, I saw our neighbors walking through my lawn and helping themselves to the vegetables. I was pretty taken back. I don't know them well but we wave at each other when we see each other. But definitely not enough that they should think they have the right to come over and help themselves.\n\nI saw them outside the next day, and went over to talk to them. I just said \"Hey I noticed that you guys were taking some of my vegetables. Unfortunately that's food my husband and I really depend on, so I really need you to stop.\" They at first got indignant, but I told them I had them on camera. The conversation ended on a sour note but I thought we had reached a conclusion. \n\nUntil I checked my cameras again and saw them AGAIN. The first thing I did was install locks on the insides of my fence so they couldn't get in, but then I took the footage to the police. I told them I didn't want them charged with anything, but that I had already told them they couldn't do that and it was ignored, and I wanted a paper trail. \n\nWell I saw an officer at their door the next day. After he left, the woman came outside and started screaming at the house that they were hungry and had kids to feed and she couldn't believe I called the police.
