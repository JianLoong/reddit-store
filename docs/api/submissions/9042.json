Where I live, it\u2019s common knowledge that if you get sent the wrong thing, you have full reign to go ahead and eat it. I\u2019m pretty sure they\u2019re not supposed to ask for it back either (health risk to the recipient, who knows what could\u2019ve happened in that 10-15 mins), but this probably varies depending on the app. \n\nHowever, to remove any chance of you being an AH you could contact the company regarding the burrito (but from your recount of the interaction with the driver, you did nothing wrong).", "NTA a million times over. They CANNOT take that food and give it back to another customer. \n\nI\u2019m a server, similar principle: once I drop food on a table and walk away, I CANNOT take that food back and give it to another table. No matter what. The only time I can do that is if it hasn\u2019t left my hand or I haven\u2019t left the table yet, and even then, once food touches down on the table it\u2019s pretty iffy. \n\nIt\u2019s a huge liability issue. And most people would not want a dinner they knew had been taken inside and opened in someone else\u2019s home. If I found out my delivery driver not only dropped off my order to the wrong house but then tried to GIVE ME THAT SAME ORDER, I would be so disgusted. The food would have been completely cold anyway! The driver was just mad he fucked up so bad and now he has to go pick up a second dinner.", "NTA - the delivery driver messed up.  You might want to let the food delivery app know what happened, because that is 100% not cool that he wanted to take food back and deliver it to the original person.  Once it leaves his hands, it can't be re-delivered.  It's like if I gave your meal to someone else in a restaurant, then went back and took the plate back to give it to you.", "NTA.  Those apps will never have a driver ask for the meal back.", "NTA. That's actually gross if he takes it back from you after leaving you alone with it- what if you had done something to it? (Not saying you would). Why didn't he just take it with him to deliver correctly and bring you your food later?", "NTA: Mistakes happen and so do missed delivers. Companies have processes in place for when they occur. \nIf the delivery driver is going to lose his job it is not solely because of this one mistake. He would have had other issues already. \n\nI have never heard of someone wanting a wrong meal delivered back. That is just weird. I am also certain that it would be against some food administration laws to return food and serve it to the correct people.", "NTA I wouldn't want food that was sitting out wherever. That happened to me once where they dropped off 4 milkshakes and enough food for the 4 people who ordered it when I was just getting 1 burrito. I threw it in the freezer and messaged the company and he did end up coming back about 10 minutes later but while I know I did nothing to that food, I just would not want that to happen to me. They need that strike because they made the mistake. You can't just trust the food would be okay once it's out of your hands.", "NTA. Once you deliver the wrong food and the person takes it into their house, you can't re-deliver it anyway! Way back when I worked in fast food drive-thru, if you hand someone a bag that wasn't there and they literally hand it right back to you, we had to throw the food away.", "Wait, this guy was going to take food that he'd delivered incorrectly and just hand it over to someone else like it was nbd? Yeah, you're NTA here. He is.", "NTA OP, Uber has the same kinda policy. You don\u2019t return food that was delivered in error if they\u2019ve already left.", "NTA. Once it changes hands, they can't (and shouldn't) deliver it. My guess is the delivery driver was going to take the steak back for himself (since he was going to be responsible for it anyway).", "NTA the Pandemic caused health and safety guidelines to prevent places from taking back food they just gave you. You could get $100 worth of the wrong order in a drive thru and they can't take it back. Driver massively fucked up and clearly needs to do 1 order at time if 2 orders is too complicated.", "NTA. It'd be so unethical for that driver to give the steaks to the correct customer after leaving the bag in your possession. You could've done anything to that food, he doesn't know! It's unfortunate that his mistake was pricey, but he should've been more careful.", "NTA.\n\nI\u2019d be livid. These people get tipped before they do their job. Then they do their job poorly and complain when it doesn\u2019t work out. I ask em to put it at the back door and 9/10 it\u2019s at the front door. Wtf is the tip even for?!?!?", "\" But to my surprise, he asks for the steak dinner back.\"\n\nHe isn't supposed to do that.  Food regulation reasons.  Since it was out of his hands he doesn't know who touched it.  I ordered take out from a Chinese restaurant.  I got home, unpacked everything and realized this wasn't my order.  They wouldn't take it back.  Once it leaves, they can't ask for it back to give to someone else.  That's a big no no.  My guess is that the driver didn't want to eat the cost or have to wait for the food to be ready to deliver again.  Sucks to be him. It was his mistake.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNTA", "It is not legal (here anyway) for them to accept food back from you anyway. When it has happened to me I've called up and they just said kerp or toss it.\n\nThe driver surely knew this but miggt have been hoping to cover his ass and just deliver it late.\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nAlthough, you probably ate 3 meals, not two. \n\nIf you want to talk about food safety, I wouldn't want food I ordered to be in another customer's hands for 10 seconds, much less 10 minutes. It's a different thing if he had handed it to you and then took it inside or had handed it back to him right away but this is a risk they take with \"contactless\" delivery.", "they won\u2019t take the food back once they give it to you anyways wouldve just been thrown out enjoy that meal like a king", "NTA, you\u2019re not allowed to redeliver food. The driver was trying to get around their screw up which is a concern for the delivery company. \n\nI\u2019m more concerned about the person that orders a steak dinner from a delivery service. That\u2019s not optimal food for that kind of service.", "NTA. You took advantage of the driver's mistake, but I also don't see how simply letting the food be thrown away (which it would/should be since it left the driver's custody) would have been a better solution for anyone. Once the driver left your house, that food became undeliverable. \n\nMaybe the driver was just hoping that if they were going to take the fall for the mistake, they'd at least get to eat the food themselves. NGL, that would've been me in their shoes. Or they might've been planning to attempt to deliver anyway and sweep it under the rug, which isn't cool but I can't really blame them for the impulse.", "Nta. If it was delivered it can\u2019t be returned and given to someone else for food safety concerns. Driver screwed up.", "NTA He\u2019s not allowed to take the food back. Sucks for him but those are the rules.", "The delivery guy made a mistake.   But you are a bit of an AH.", "You ate 2 steaks in 10 mins? Are you ok?? \n\nYTA tho because you should have contacted support again saying you got the burrito and the guy fixed his mistake", "You have an option for a refund or replacement order at no additional charge. Up to the customer.", "Nta. You shouldn\u2019t have ate food you didn\u2019t pay for but it was the drivers mistake and I wouldn\u2019t want a burrito that\u2019s been sitting an extra 20 mins past the original delivery time. That\u2019s a problem on DoorDash end and honestly part of the problem with the system. When dealing with a restaurant they rectify it but the onus falls on the private contractor so technically it\u2019s just their problem. It might be harsh but when I make mistakes at work people can die. Somebody has to be accountable here.", "YTA. Because of what you did, the person who ordered the steak didn't get their meal. The difference will be charged to the delivery driver who made the mistake, and who gets paid peanuts to begin with.", "[deleted]", "NTA - once they give the customer food, they cannot legally take it back. This is a food safety rule because they can\u2019t know if anything was done to the food while in your possession.", "NTA \nI\u2019m pretty sure you aren\u2019t allowed to deliver it to someone else if it has already been in someone else\u2019s house. At least where I live you aren\u2019t. \nYou didn\u2019t steal anything he literally handed it to you.", "Yta sorry dude, you knew it wasn't your order.  I had something similiar happen where I got someone else's HUGE order. I called the resturant!  Told them what happened.  The resent the correct order and told me to keep the wrong order.  I did not mess with the wrong order *bc it wasn't mine*.  The resturant could have asked for it back to toss it.", "Sorry, but YTA.\n\nEating the steak was understandable -- you had no way of knowing that what you had actually ordered would be delivered. But you shouldn't have accepted the burrito in that situation, and should have contacted the company to refuse the credit.", "YTA you know it too.", "YTA. \n\nYou knew it wasn\u2019t your food and didn\u2019t even try and contact the food delivery company before tucking in.", "YTA\n\nNevermind the legality of this whole situation, (just because something is accidentally misdelivered to you does not give you the right to keep it), the way in which you handled this makes you a huge asshole. \n\nThere are a few reasons why I believe you were the asshole here:\n\nWhile you did report the fact that you received someone's order in the app, a responsible thing to do would have been to contact the restaurant, as well. \n\nFurther to the point, you chose to immediately \"go to town\" on this food that you knew was not yours. Again, you did report it, but you did not give anyone any time to respond to this situation. Granted, they might not have been able to get that particular food to the correct person because it was already in your house, but you never know. Bottom line, it was not yours, regardless if they had to dispose of it or not. You don't get to make that call. \n\nAlso, you willingly accepted a credit for something that, in my opinion, you had no right to. You had to wait an additional 10-15 min to receive your original order. That's not really worthy of 2 free meals plus an extra $10.  Not to mention the fact that you immediately ate the first order without so much as giving it a second though. \n\nFinally, your attitude about the whole thing paints you as an asshole. You literally laughed at this person for making a mistake, basically saying \"oh well, sucker!\"", "Going against the grain here, but y t a, how can you not notice the difference in weight of a 2 steak dinner vs a burrito??? You should have checked the label and that would have clarified the mistake. The driver could have returned the steak and give you the right meal.\n\nEdit: I did not realize the delivery was contactless (where I am it's not contactless). In that case there is nothing much you can do. Where I am the delivery is not contactless (you tip at delivery), so changing the verdict to NTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

When instead you could have done the right thing and contacted customer support and the driver, who could have returned immediately instead of 10-15 mins later with your order.
