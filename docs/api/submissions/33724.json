Then when I refuse to drink because I want to keep an eye on him and how much he\u2019s drinking, he\u2019ll loudly ask me why I\u2019m not drinking and try to start interrogating me.

He\u2019s 63. he rarely drinks but if he does he over does it and gets sloppy. He never learned to hold his drink. Your bf is young so there time to learn BUT you won\u2019t make him realize he has to change, this has to come from him. I know how you feel though. It\u2019s embarrassing. You\u2018re automatically go into mom-mode to do damage control in those situations but it doesn\u2019t really work. \n\nI\u2019d be pissed too and i would make him clean up all the mess himself.

Know that there's probably other mental health disorders that come out due to alcohol, potentially anxiety. Ask if he likes the feeling of being hung over and backing out. Ask if he thinks he should just never take the first drink.\n\nAlso, you *never* \"learn to drink properly\" by going to a place where you can drink a lot, it's simply unhealthy to drink a lot and especially addictive for some people.\n\nNTA, but try to get your bf help.

In fact throw in some 7am vacuuming for good measure", "It's time to have a serious talk with him. You don't get to control what he does, but you do get to control who you spend time with. Tell him how it makes you feel when he's drunk, tell him that you don't accept being put in that position. He's got to make a choice. Don't put up with his bad behaviour. But know that if he's an alcoholic it's not easy to stop. You can't drag him out of it. Don't keep giving him chance after chance. Either it stops, or it continues without you there.

He needs to not drink or have someone  \"police\" his intake. He sounds like he could become an alcoholic easily.

Do not take this shit from him or anyone else.", "NTA but you\u2019ve got to talk with him at a time when there\u2019s no drinking happening, or happening soon, so you can have a proper conversation where you\u2019re not \u201cpolicing\u201d his immediate behaviour, but instead laying out the problem and coming up with a plan on how to fix it. \n\nYou and him against the problem, not you against him. \n\nThere are lots of options. Maybe you specifically drink a couple times a week and have 2-3 drinks only to show the effects. Maybe in social situations you have a rule of one alcoholic drink, one soft, repeat. Maybe he matches your drinks exactly for a while so he can get a handle on how to do it. \n\nLoads of possibilities. \n\nHowever, hate to do a Reddit but if this is something he\u2019s not willing to work on, binge drinking (and this __is__ binge drinking) is something that can end relationships."]}
