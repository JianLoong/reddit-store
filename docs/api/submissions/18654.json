We have been trying for a baby pretty much since our honeymoon.  After the first 2 miscarriages, we both saw doctors to get ourselves checked out.  I checked out OK, but my wife didn't.  Without giving away too much information, she has a medical condition that can effect both her ability to become pregnant, and also increases risk of miscarriage.  We tried a lot of treatment options, but nothing seemed to help.  After the second miscarriage, we didn't have success getting pregnant again on our own.\n\nWe discussed adoption, but she really wants a biological child.  So we started exploring other options and ended up on IVF.  However, after being told the cost, I expressed a lot of concerns.  First, I am the only one working right now.  My wife is just finishing up the first year of her masters program and quit her job to focus on that.  Now, I make good money.  More than enough to support us both and to afford the IVF, but it's still a lot of money.  After a few hard conversations, we agreed to give it a try.  \n\nUnfortunately, the first cycle didn't work so we tried for a second time.  Thankfully, that one has seemed to work and my wife is currently 10-weeks pregnant.  Due to our history with this, we decided together to wait until at least 12-weeks to tell anyone.  Not even our families know yet.  \n\nThis past weekend we went to a BBQ with a bunch of my wife's friends for Memorial Day.  Before we went, we discussed what we would say if anyone asked my wife why she wasn't drinking.  I figured the easy one would be that she was driving, but my wife didn't think that was convincing enough and insisted that we tell people she's on a round of antibiotics.  I didn't think too much into it.\n\nA few hours into the party, my wife's college roommate came up to me with a huge grin on her face.  She gave me a big hug and whispered to me that my wife told her the good news.  I tried to play it cool and just subtly thanked her and told her that we are still waiting to tell people.  I caught a glimpse of my wife looking over and she immediately looked away.  \n\nOn the way home, I brought it up.  She said her friend asked her if she wanted a drink and she panicked and didn't know what to say.  I told her we literally rehearsed that and she said it just kind of came out.  \n\nI told her it's pretty hypocritical of her to do something like that and just play it off when we both know if it was me who told someone, she'd blow a gasket. She said it's her body and her pregnancy and she can tell people about it if she wants to.  I told her it's still my baby too, and it's my money paying for it, so I should get a say in it too.  \n\nShe immediately got pissed and started yelling at me about how she's the one going through huge changes that I will never understand and she's going to tell people if she wants.  She said I wouldn't even have known if her friend didn't tell me, so I shouldn't be an asshole and make a big deal out of it.", "created_utc": 1685564848, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13wx1f5/aita_for_calling_my_wife_a_hypocrite_for_telling/", "score": 44, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

What if she tells someone else?\u201d Sometimes even when your partner does something you agreed not to do, you just roll with it instead of making it an argument. \n\nIt sounds like you wanted to argue so you created the opportunity for yourself. Very weird behavior.", "And that\u2019s relevant how\u2026?", "Did you read the post? OP\u2019s wife has a medical condition that makes it difficult for her to get pregnant and experience miscarriages. The only option they had after 2 miscarriages was IVF, which OP has had to foot the bill for because OP\u2019s wife is studying.\n\nThe life in her belongs to BOTH of them. What, do you think dad didn\u2019t contribute any sperm and it was an immaculate conception? Like, seriously, I feel terrible for OP\u2019s wife because of the sad history she\u2019s had to endure, but after they made a mutual agreement to not tell anyone, it\u2019s a valid point for him to bring up that the way they got pregnant this time is an equal thing.", "Why do you feel the need to dictate what a woman can and can't do? It is the woman's prerogative to say or do what she wants with her body. Whether you like it or not is not my problem, the man has no say in what she decides.", "It isn't an agenda. It's bodily autonomy.", "Her comment about me only knowing because her friend told me definitely has me thinking that she's told other people.  I asked her straight up if she's told anyone else and she refused to answer and told me to stop being an AH.", "He flipped out because she didn\u2019t \u201cuse the line they rehearsed\u201d.  Slip ups happen.  As long as the friend stays quiet, it didn\u2019t have to be a big deal.", "Yeah but I thought it was all \"we are a couple\" and \"supporting the partner\" and all. Regardless of what he said in the moment its still a pretty shitty thing to have an agreement to be discreet and then tell someone. The fall back being \"its her body\" like it negates her breaking her promise.\n\nAnd honestly if im going to get downvoted I think its a pretty shitty thing for her to tell someone while also allowing her to be pissed off if he told someone.  Either you agree to keep it discreet or you don't. That's what they agreed upon.  That's not what happened", "Sure. My point was relating to how she justified herself afterwards. Arguably also a mistake, but still one *she* should own up to. \n\nI'm sympathetic to both people here, and I get her feeling defensive, and I get OP feeling frustrated.", "Are you insinuating that she got pregnant on her own?", "I didn't realize there was a difference between NTA and NAH??\n\nI don't think she's an asshole for telling. I also don't think he's an asshole for bringing it up. When they both escalated, it's more like ESH, but I cut them both some slack because they're on pins and needles after two miscarriages. I think it was super hurtful for her to say \"It's my pregnancy\" because she's shutting him out. That's why he said he's paying for it. Not his best look, but I guess since he's not carrying the baby, he couldn't think of anything else to say.", "There's nothing inaccurate about it being my money either.", "What's the point of making an agreement like that if you're just going to break it?  Everyone here knows that if I was the one who blabbed it to a friend, that I would be getting blasted on here.  If I told someone at that party and my wife found out, she'd have made me walk home and everyone here would be clapping for her.", "If he was under the impression that it was an \"equal thing\" he would not have brought up money.  He seems to think that he bought his wife's pregnancy like he bought her a car, and left it in his name, because he paid for it.", "Even if you didn\u2019t mean it the way it sounds, your comment about \u201cit\u2019s your money paying for it\u201d is what makes you TA. It\u2019s irrelevant and demeaning. It equates importance to money; and it\u2019s a slippery slope\u2014and one of patriarchy\u2019s oldest tripes.", "Him making a mistake and telling someone and her blowing up at him *did not happen* though. If OP wants to tell someone too, to make it \u201ceven\u201d or whatever, that\u2019s up to them to work out", "Can cis men die from childbirth?", "I mean, it IS her pregnancy. Where is the lie?", "Is it also HIS nausea too?  HIS constipation?  HIS growing belly?\n\nNope.  It is their baby, who they made together, but she is the only one who is pregnant.  \"We are pregnant\" is never an accurate statement.", "No, there actually is, because you\u2019re a married couple. It\u2019s not just \u2018your\u2019 money. It\u2019s both of yours.", "No, you wouldn\u2019t, so stop pulling this victim act. If you accidentally panicked and let it slip, that wouldn\u2019t be ideal but it doesn\u2019t make you a monster. If your wife responded like you did, by saying truly heinous things and refusing to let it go, she would also be the asshole. \n\nHell, Jim from the office let the pregnancy slip in front of a huge crowd at their wedding and remained one of America\u2019s most beloved characters. The rest of the episode would have been a lot less charming if Pam\u2019s reaction was anything like yours.\n\nAll that it is true without the added layer of it actually being her body and her decision.", "OP brought up that if he told anyone, OP\u2019s wife would be mad\n\nOP\u2019s wife retaliates and says it\u2019s \u201cher body and her pregnancy\u201d so she can do what she wants\n\nOP retaliates back with the fact that it\u2019s not just hers, bringing up that he\u2019s also spent a lot of money trying to get pregnant again, feted them both discussing that while he can afford it, it makes things a little hard\n\nSo ultimately, yeah, you can objectively say that OP paid for the pregnancy. Sure, I\u2019ll bite.\n\nThis is why my judgement was ESH because they\u2019re both being really selfish about the situation at hand. She doesnt have carte blanche to tell whoever she wants about it, when they\u2019ve already agreed that their history of miscarriages is complicated and to wait to tell anyone.", "Can women be forced into never knowing of their child is their own?", "Well I guess it's okay to shut him out, according to  you.", "But of course, it's HER pregnancy.  I'm just the guy with the job good enough to pay for it.", ">Hell, Jim from the office let the pregnancy slip in front of a huge crowd at their wedding and remained one of America\u2019s most beloved characters.\n\nJim from the Office is a fictional character and not a good person.", "So you really think your wife\u2019s body belongs to you, huh?", "Dude, she's likely not going back to school to get a minimum wage job - it's a short term investment for higher pay for her. Something she'll now have to do with morning sickness and the very uncomfortable months of pregnancy, while also researching what to eat, how to exercise, what needs to be bought, best parenting practices, etc. - all for your family. If you were paying a surrogate, you'd be lucky to get that service for under $10K, and your wife would still likely be doing most of the researching to be a good parent.\n\nThe good news? Kindness is cheap. So is a good calm conversation.", "The scenario you presented wherein she's a hypocrite is also fictional", "Dude. This is such a minor problem and youre making it to seem huge. Talking about YOUR money and HER pregnancy. Blablabla  You both are stressed and nervous. Stop adding fuel to it. She was nervous, told her friend. You got complimented on it. So what ? Let it go and go enjoy the new family that's coming soon. Go choose names, decorate the new room, watch some series, eat good food.  Grow up and let go of this.", "Nope, not at all.  Apparently the only thing that belongs to me in this relationship is the $50K bill for IVF.", "Nope, that\u2019s hers too! Because the money belongs to both of you. Good talk.\n\nYou know what is yours? Your body.", "Are you also experiencing nausea, OP?  Is it also \"your\" constipation?  Are your boobs sore too?  \n\nThis baby is both of yours.  But only one of you is pregnant.", "Separate finances.  Her request.  She wanted to keep our student debt separate since I still have quite a bit left."]}
