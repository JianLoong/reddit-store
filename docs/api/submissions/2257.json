She could have called to ask about a substitute.\n\nEdit: Before anyone downvotes for \"ingratitude,\" I hope you've never had someone mix both weaponized incompetence with gift giving, because it is a special kind of obnoxious. Some folks will never make any effort to hear what you actually want or like and expect you to be grateful when they keep giving you things they should know better than to give.

You could have thanked her for trying, gone to get your own coffee, and found a home for the extra hot chocolate together.", "NTA- reading your replies to other comments it seems like this is not uncommon for her to get you things that you have a history of not liking or not being able to have.

Why would you drink something you don\u2019t like.  I am that person: I don\u2019t like it, I don\u2019t eat it or drink it.  She could have gotten you coffee or called to see what you wanted.  It seems like she sets you up so she can tell you how awful you are.", "Not really an AH, but you didn't need to get all up in her for trying. Just say thanks, mom and don't drink it. So, maybe a little bit of assholery on your part after all.", "NTA. Sounds like something my mom would do. She doesn\u2019t even know you.

You're working - coffee helps people work, hot chocolate doesn't. \n\nAs you said, a normal coffee makes sense as a replacement rather than a hot chocolate. Hot chocolate isn't going to give you any energy, and, she should already know you don't like hot chocolate.\n\nI don't know how to copy and paste a sentence from your post (I'm on mobile) but where you said she has a pattern of choosing things she likes over what other people do sounds like what happened here.

You're hosting your mother just for a weekend, and you felt you had to have this argument?

She sucks because she got you hot chocolate instead of coffee, but you suck too for questioning why she didn't know there were other coffee shops in a neighborhood she is visiting.

Although you don't like hot chocolate, it's the thought that counts, and a whole fight over it is unwarranted.", "You weren't TA until you harped on her for going to \"the one place that doesn't do coffee when there's like 3 coffeeshops on that block.\" She was going out doing her own errands; picking you up anything was an added favor that was out of her way. It's not like it was something you *needed.* Maybe she thought hot chocolate was a safer bet because she didn't know what kind of coffee you would have wanted as your second choice. I know I'm super picky about my coffee, and other mothers probably wouldn't have gotten you anything upon finding out the place was closed. She tried to do a simple nice thing and you threw it in her face. \n\nFor some personal context, my mom is not the best gift giver. I always ask for exactly what I want and she always finds ways to get things that I don't like or won't use. It's not something I have any right to get mad over, though; she tries really hard to be thoughtful, at the end of the day we just have different taste. Something else about my mother: it's extremely easy to make her upset, and I've learned to choose my battles. If my mom went out of her way to try and get me my favorite coffee and came home with hot cocoa, I would thank her with the biggest smile and either drink some and discreetly throw away the rest, or offer her half because she likes it. I'm not sure how old you are but as a 27 year old female I've certainly learned what is and isn't worth fighting over.", "YTA she was going to make an extra stop for you, the place was closed so she went to another. If a store sold pastries then I would think they also sold pumpkin spice coffee at this time of the year. So that's the store she went to. Just say thanks, don't ask why they didn't try harder.", "YTA.\n\nDoes your mom know there's other coffee shops nearby and which one's you'd prefer she go to, or did she decide to try to be nice and get something instead of nothing and you want to be shitty, rather than appreciative, towards the effort...?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Just saying that so you understand I get it. Years ago I was at my parent\u2019s place. I was in the kitchen. She was making beef veggie soup. (I now know why hers is so horrible. She uses canned veggies, drains them then adds tap water to make it a soup. It\u2019s horrible.) While she\u2019s making it she tells me she knows my dad hates it but she loves it and it\u2019s cheap. So to make up for it she makes cornbread bc he loves it. I take my dad his plate and he gave a huff. I can\u2019t tell you how many times I\u2019ve told your mom I hate this but she still makes it. So I recount the cornbread comment. He just rolls his eyes at me and said..I hate cornbread too. So when mom comes in I careful and politely let her know dad hates both. (They are close to 50 years into their marriage at this point.) The next time I\u2019m over it is dejavu. Mom starts making the same meal and telling me the same story. I remind her she made this meal the last time I was there and dad hates both the soup and cornbread. She was floored. He never told her. I replied with...we discussed it over dinner the last time I was here. You\u2019ll be happy to know that...mom still makes that soup but she adds the cornbread as a peace offering to my dad. No. She doesn\u2019t have dementia.", "Yeah, that's what I was saying. I can see OP getting a bunch of AH judgments because lots of people are all \"You can just graciously accept a gift without telling someone you didn't like it,\" while not acknowledging that gift giving isn't always a benign behavior.

You're the asshole. You can wonder why she didn't get you coffee but why bring it up with her? What was the point? Was she supposed to leave and go get you coffee? You were ungrateful and deserved the earful you got. Doesn't matter if you drank it or not. The right thing to say when someone does something nice for you is thank you.", "Is it really a nice thing to get someone something they dislike and another thing they're allergic to?", "Okay I will say I have done this. For several years I thought my husband loved maple syrup. Like, that he liked that flavor of things. I don\u2019t know why. I can\u2019t pinpoint where this certainty came from, but I believed it. It culminated with me giving him a bottle of fancy maple syrup from a syrup place once and he reminded me he doesn\u2019t like it (again, I can now remember he HAS said this multiple times but for some reason it took years for my brain to undo that one initial \u201che loves it\u201d impression). Anyway it FINALLY stuck and god I hope I\u2019m not doing this for any other foods/to my children.

My narc mother elevates it to an art form.", "She could have got coffee somewhere else. Instead she got a drink she knows they do not like and a pastry made almost completely of a food they are allergic to, so not a good second choice at all.\n\nOP you are NTA.

Because my grandma who suffering from dementia used to do similar things to me. And I was so easily irritated by those kinds of things. And threw tantrums at her. Later when she was diagnosed with AD. I felt so guilty. \n\nJust make sure it's not an early symptom of any disease.", "Oh gods, this has made me paranoid like nothing else!", "NAH. She tried to do something she thought would be nice and got it wrong, you explained she got it wrong. Just because someone got upset doesn't mean anyone was an ass.", "NTA. Only you truly know the answer to whether or not your mom is weaponizing gift giving to be a turd to you, or she's just a person who struggles with gift giving in general because she doesn't know how to make sure she's getting something that the recipient would like. \n\nSome people are like this without realizing it and their heart is in the right place... other people are just narcissistic and being malicious.  Her response in this case may have been because her feelings were hurt, OR because she was trying to trigger you... it's hard for a neutral 3rd party to know.\n\nI personally would be curious about what her experience was like as a kid: did her parents make her feel seen and validated, or were her needs always dismissed? Did she grow up in poverty, or did she typically get what she wanted on holidays and birthdays?  It's a mindf\\*ck when we realize our parents are often just carrying around unhealed hurts from their own childhoods, but it could have something to do with her gift giving patterns.", "YTA \n\nYou knew there was a possibility the bakery is closed (your mom couldn't have known that), still you sent her there with no backup plan for when its closed already.\n\nAnd about the hot chocolate, tbf, if someone wants a pumpkin latte and there is none i would also go for a sweet drink and not a normal coffee since normal coffee drinkers usually don't drink this sweet stuff, so i would put you in the \"chocolates and other fancy stuff drinkers\"-group.\n\nAlso i think its really stupid to make a fuss and start drama over a hot chocolate.", "I can vouch for this, because my mother is like this as well. It does not come from a place of malice but lack of emotional intelligence/her upbringing being abusive. It's important to remember that our parents have an inner child that probably isn't healed in cases like these: not to excuse the behavior, but to make it make sense at least."]}
