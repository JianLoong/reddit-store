Such minor, inconsequential nuisances, like putting forks in the dishwasher differently, but it all just made my teeth grate.  \n\nJust as you were used to living on your own without rules, they were used to living on their own without someone else treating the house as \"theirs.\"  So Stepdad eventually snapped.  And ultimately, it all worked out, because you all seem to love each other.  You just can't live with each other for prolonged periods.\n\nYou are totally fine for saying what you do, because that IS what happened, and is your \"side\" of it.  Your mom should simply own her side of it with the same aplomb, instead of feeling shamed.  All she needs to say is \"Yes, I think 8 months was long enough for us to have three adults under one roof.\"  People are way more understanding than she is giving them credit for, especially since your relationship clearly survived.", "NTA.

They took you in and provided free rent for 8 months.\n\nBut free rent isn't free. It's a favour and you have an obligation to do all they ask of you and a bit more. So the mopping and sweeping  and making dinner is the baseline. You should do all those without complaint and before being asked. Plus look for a few other ways to be helpful, both by helping with chores and the helping with the emotional tone of the house.\n\nYour mom and step-dad  gave up space and privacy to host you while you needed it. That's great. You should repay with cheerful household help, volunteer extra help, try to leave the house for longer stretches to let them have their house back and generally be a nice guest.\n\nIt's emotionally exhausting being a \"good guest\" for long stretches but that's the price of free rent. It's never your space and you can never really relax and throw a jacket on the floor and eat cheetos in your underwear in the living room.\n\nI would also say you weren't kicked out which implies you were tossed on the street. It sounds like things built up, you had saved some money and your mom asked you to move out without a month. You agreed to move out.\n\nIt really sounds like things weren't going great for a bit and you should have offered to move out a bit sooner and your mom and step-dad should have also suggested you move out earlier. You should have been discussing your plans for moving on with them the whole time. There should have been a time-line and an end date and discussions if you were still having trouble financially. Both of you failed on the communication but they provided you free room and board for almost a year and you provided them \"some issues\".   \n\n\n  \n\n\nReducing that entire time to a simple \"you were kicked out\" is weaponising the last month and really hurting your mom. I was obvious that it was time for you to leave and  therefore she asked  you to leave. It totally fails to acknowledge the 8 months of support they gave you when you needed it.  \n\n\nThis just sounds like the other half of the \"we let our down on the luck kid/relative/friend stay with us to get back on their feet and they paid absolutely nothing, whined about chores, and were generally rude to us.

Whether or not that was fair is a different debate.

You were kicked out.  After an ex kicked me and two children (number three was born 18 days later) out my grandparents took us in until I could figure out work and heal from child birth (stay at home mom with no work experience).  They were really generous and I am truly grateful but it got to the point where things were getting nasty fast.  Little things like kids swimming so I carried them in to the shower so they wouldn\u2019t get grass or wet inside and so I didn\u2019t immediately clean up the toys outside.  Nasty comments came and snide suggestions that I never cleaned up after myself.  One time I wasn\u2019t fast enough cleaning up after the kids made my grandpa so angry he left the house and slammed the door.  I just wanted to lay them down so I could wash the plates in a minute after they were settled.  It got so bad.  I moved before I was fully ready but we got out in time to prevent getting kicked out.  It gets bad with family sometimes.", "NTA - your mom should have stuck up for you if she didn\u2019t want you to say you were kicked out. Call it like it is, it does make her look bad - but who\u2019s fault is that?", "I am inclined to say NTA but I think it really depends on your motivation to say it... are you saying it because it comes naturally during a conversation or because you want everyone to know that they kicked you out? I mean if you purposely want them to look bad then I think YTA.", "NTA you were kicked out and if you mom doesn\u2019t like people hearing that then she shouldn\u2019t have kicked you out.", "Kicked out for being a jerk and kicked out because your parents are jerks aren\u2019t the same thing. The real issue is that the mom feels like she\u2019s being portrayed as the jerk because of OP\u2019s phrasing, and without knowing the reasons it\u2019s impossible to pass judgment.", "You were kicked out. Telling people you were kicked out was the truth. I'm sorry your mother is ashamed that it makes her look bad because you were kicked out, but you were kicked out. So shame on her. \n\nNTA", "ESH, you sound a bit like the grown (26!!) adult that didn't do a whole lot at home, therefore you basically overstayed your welcome. Step dad sounds like an AH but saying you were kicked out is just being petty to your mom, and also makes YOU look bad in the process. Just say that you moved out, which it sounds like you were planning on doing anyway,and get over it.", "You complained about mopping once a week?

Your mom and stepdad took you in during a terrible and stressful time. It was tough on all of you. None of you were perfect\u2014but they were the ones giving you a place to live. You were all ready for it to end, but your stepdad cracked first. And your tagline for that time was \u201cWhen I was kicked out\u201d?\n\nYou are N T A as long as you say, \u201cwhen I was kicked out, after I was snotty to my stepdad when I was getting ready to leave anyway after they took me in for a year or two in the middle of a pandemic and basically supported me, and saved my butt.\u201d", "Apparently things like cooking with to much spice, or moping the next day, not the one OP was told to mop, turning the music down. I think that the stepdad didn't want OP to move in the first place and his wife convinced him, and then took it on OP.", "Your mother won't agree because it means she has to take some responsibility for what happened. She doesn't want to look bad or to feel bad, so she'll always throw a fit when confronted with the truth she doesn't want to acknowledge.", "OP was there for 8 months, not a year or two. He did chores around the house to help out so they weren\u2019t supporting him with no reciprocation. Step-dad snapped over OP turning off music and then told him to leave. How is that not being kicked out?", "Lol", "So you broke the rules of you being there, cooked food he couldn't eat and woke him up? Did you apologise for any of these things?", "OP, I can empathize.  I have an Aunt who is a wonderful guest, amazing person, so much fun - but a *terrible* host.  She's fine with people stopping by for an hour or so, but any more than that she just doesn't want people (aside from her husband and child) in \"her space.\"  In college she was the only relative close by, so I would spend breaks and Thanksgiving with her.  After a few hours, she would start criticizing me over the tiniest things.  It was \"safe\" for her to take her anger out on me (she's was going through issues at work at the time) because I'm family.  She once yelled at me for 4 minutes and 30 seconds straight (I timed it) because my shoes reminded me of the wrong grandmother.  Seriously.  \n\nIt sounds like your mom and step-dad just don't like having anyone besides them in their home for more than a quick (and by quick I mean an hour or two tops) visit.  Some people are just weird about their homes/space.  \n\nBut yes, they did kick you out.  You have the long text from step-dad to prove it.  So, NTA.", "He could have some other stuff going on emotionally.  Also some medical conditions can also make him more irritable.   I knew about dementia, but some of this list was a surprise to me.

While your mom is being an AH here, you don't seem to think she's otherwise awful and value your relationship with her.  I'm betting she's stressed because your stepdad is acting wonky in other ways.  You could consider \"it wasn't working out\" in front of her and update others out of earshot to keep the peace.  But I don't know if that's a good or bad approach for dealing with denial long-term.", "Rehomed doesn't really work, as it would imply they found OP a new home.\nEvicted maybe. Lol.", "It doesn't sound like OP was a perfect roommate, but they met the expectations set down for them and their step-dad lost their shit over music being turned off *after he left the room.* Maybe I'm biased because I had an abusive father like this who would BLAST music at any hour and get mad if people turned it off *even if it was after he'd left the house for several hours*, but it's a ridiculous expectation to have! Turn off your music when you leave or someone else will! Just turn it back on if you want to listen to it! It tells me that you're so deeply uncomfortable with the notion that we don't actually want to hear your music, but we put up with it for you... And why would that upset someone with rational psychology? Someone who doesn't feel the need to alienate everyone who isn't like them or capitulating to them?\n\nIt wasn't a calm discussion that lead to OP looking for a new place with their blessing, they evicted him. Maybe he can switch to saying he was evicted, but it effectively means the same.\n\nEdit: I meant to reply to the person arguing with you, apologies if I sound incredulous and antagonistic. I agree with you.", "His chores were mopping/hoovering (which he says he did complain about!), cooking dinner twice a week, cleaning his *own bathroom* and walking the dog. Those are not onerous tasks!  He wasn\u2019t paying rent, let\u2019s not forget that. \n\nClearly there was fractiousness building up between OP and his family, or else his step dad wouldn\u2019t have snapped, plus he wasn\u2019t kicked out, he was given a month to find a new place, which is fair enough really.", "I\u2019m not really sure how that makes it not kicking OP out", "\"Sorry mom, I wasn't **kicked** out because you gave me notice.

You\u2019ve never turned a tv you didn\u2019t turn on off?", "Nah, you\u2019re fine. You conveyed some of what I wasn\u2019t able too!", "OP states that it ended up where his mom & step-dad agreed to 30 days, not that that was the initial plan. I agree, those aren\u2019t difficult tasks to complete and OP probably shouldn\u2019t have complained about mopping. The friction was likely because both parties had grown used to living without each other and then had to readjust. It happens. I think everyone could have (and should have) been better about their actions in this situation.", "LOL", "I agree with what you say here. It sounds like a messy situation where everyone could have behaved better - but it was lockdown and a difficult time for a lot of people, so maybe OP should cut his mum some slack and stop saying she \u201ckicked him out\u201d. He should instead have a conversation with his mum and Step dad about how hurt he still feels and they can work together to come to some closure. \n\nIt\u2019s technically true that they did kick him out, but they did give him 30 days grace (clearly they realised an immediate expulsion would be a massive asshole move) and he wanted to leave himself anyway. It was only supposed to be a temporary arrangement and now it\u2019s time to move on."]}
