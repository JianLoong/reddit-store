I ran out of money fast and ended up putting a lot of debt onto my credit card.\n\nMy mother and step dad were worried about the debt I was accumulating and asked me to move in with them. I had rules and followed them with only the occasional complaint about mopping. The rules were things like sweeping/vacuuming/mopping the floor once a week, cooking dinner twice a week, keeping my bathroom clean, and walking the dog twice a day. \n\nI was there about 8 months and, while we had had some issues (I was 26 at the time and had been living on my own since I was 19, very not used to other people constantly being around), I thought things were going OK. \n\nI had started to feel like it was time to move out though, I'd saved up some money and was getting tired of the passive-aggressiveness.\n\nAnyway, one day we were all sitting in the living room, my mum on her computer with headphones in, my step dad on his computer, and me reading. My step dad got up and brought his computer to another room for to do a call but he'd left his music playing out of the Alexa. Since he was in a different room and my mum had headphones in, I turned off the music to better concentrate on my book. When my step dad came back our quiet afternoon together turned into a literal screaming match. \n\nHe got pissy that I turned off the music and I made a (somewhat snide) comment that \"someone's having a bad day\". That was all he needed to start his meltdown. Screaming and yelling about how I never did anything around the house and was generally just a burden to them.\n\nMy mother tried to intervene at one point but both of us told her to stay out of it. The night ended with me miserable and crying in my room. \n\nThe next morning I woke up to a text that was literally 5 paragraphs long but the gist of it was that he wanted me out,  immediately.

After 6 months my mum said that I should just put what I was paying to pay back my credit card. Along with every other cent I had, I put $250 of that rent into the credit card and saved the other $250. When I say I was starting to save for moving out, I had only saved $500 when I got kicked out; not even half of what the rent for a bachelor's apartment in my province goes for. \n\nAnd for people saying I was a jerk for over spicing the food I cooked, I literally just used what the recipe indicated. And SD doesn't have ulcers or colitis or any real reason not to like it, he just doesn't like flavour, lol (and I know that sounds dicky but it's true).\n\nAs for my mother, she's always been a doormat for him and what he wants so this was no surprise.

I understand the passive aggressive tension you were feeling.  It basically just becomes \"Bitch eating crackers\" level of energy.  Such minor, inconsequential nuisances, like putting forks in the dishwasher differently, but it all just made my teeth grate.  \n\nJust as you were used to living on your own without rules, they were used to living on their own without someone else treating the house as \"theirs.\"  So Stepdad eventually snapped.  And ultimately, it all worked out, because you all seem to love each other.  You just can't live with each other for prolonged periods.\n\nYou are totally fine for saying what you do, because that IS what happened, and is your \"side\" of it.  Your mom should simply own her side of it with the same aplomb, instead of feeling shamed.  All she needs to say is \"Yes, I think 8 months was long enough for us to have three adults under one roof.\"  People are way more understanding than she is giving them credit for, especially since your relationship clearly survived.", "NTA.

You\u2019re also just simply stating the current state of affairs so to speak.", "NTA, start saying \"i was forcibly relocated to another place courtesy of mom and stepdad.\"", "Overall, it is a not a nice thing to say. They took you in and provided free rent for 8 months.\n\nBut free rent isn't free. It's a favour and you have an obligation to do all they ask of you and a bit more. So the mopping and sweeping  and making dinner is the baseline. You should do all those without complaint and before being asked. Plus look for a few other ways to be helpful, both by helping with chores and the helping with the emotional tone of the house.\n\nYour mom and step-dad  gave up space and privacy to host you while you needed it. That's great. You should repay with cheerful household help, volunteer extra help, try to leave the house for longer stretches to let them have their house back and generally be a nice guest.\n\nIt's emotionally exhausting being a \"good guest\" for long stretches but that's the price of free rent. It's never your space and you can never really relax and throw a jacket on the floor and eat cheetos in your underwear in the living room.\n\nI would also say you weren't kicked out which implies you were tossed on the street. It sounds like things built up, you had saved some money and your mom asked you to move out without a month. You agreed to move out.\n\nIt really sounds like things weren't going great for a bit and you should have offered to move out a bit sooner and your mom and step-dad should have also suggested you move out earlier. You should have been discussing your plans for moving on with them the whole time. There should have been a time-line and an end date and discussions if you were still having trouble financially. Both of you failed on the communication but they provided you free room and board for almost a year and you provided them \"some issues\".   \n\n\n  \n\n\nReducing that entire time to a simple \"you were kicked out\" is weaponising the last month and really hurting your mom. I was obvious that it was time for you to leave and  therefore she asked  you to leave. It totally fails to acknowledge the 8 months of support they gave you when you needed it.  \n\n\nThis just sounds like the other half of the \"we let our down on the luck kid/relative/friend stay with us to get back on their feet and they paid absolutely nothing, whined about chores, and were generally rude to us.

It sucks that you lost your job in the pandemic but youre an adult and not entitled to housing from them. You are still in a much better position for their help.\n\nId feel differently if they did insist you move out in 24 hours, but 30 days is not \"kicking someone out\"\n\nIt sucks stepdad shouted but we all lose out cool with family sometimes", "Why say anything then?  Or simply say we had a difference of opinion and I needed to find my own place! It also sounds like there is more to this story and possibly another side; you mentioned your had \"rules\" for your stay; when those \"rules\" are common everyday household chores so not necessarily rules and you were already looking at leaving, they just decided to have you do it sooner. Also 30 days is a normal \"eviction\" policy! \n\nYou say \"at the end of they though....I LOVE THEM BOTH\" but the way you speak about both of them shows little to no respect nor love!", "Around me the term \"kicked out\" implies that something immoral of shady went on. Widely accepted reasons for using the term would include things like notifying a minor they'll need to move out, no notice given, ending a tennant's lease early when they never broke the terms, ect. At the very least it means the person saying it is super salty and wants others to think poorly about the people who kicked them out. \n\nIf OP is using it without giving folks the context that they were an adult who moved back in with their mom and stepdad rent free, had been there for months, and were given 30 days notice then I can kind of see how that is hurtful to the mother. \n\nPersonally I think OP should replace the term \"kicked out\" with \"evicted.\"", "> while we had had some issues (I was 26 at the time and had been living on my own since I was 19, very not used to other people constantly being around), I thought things were going OK.\n> \n> I had started to feel like it was time to move out though, I'd saved up some money and was getting tired of the passive-aggressiveness.\n\nYeah, step-dad went from concerned about the debt enough to ask her to move in to \"get out\" in 8 months. He blew up over the very minor incident in question, but OP had months to get tired of the passive-aggressiveness (which contradicts her having no idea he had issues with her behavior) so *something* was building for months.", "OP was an adult who paid $500 a month in rent to his mom as well as having assigned chores, so kicked out is *fair*, but illegally evicted is more correct.", "How is an argument between 2 adults domestic violence? Do you even know what that is?", "Mom probably feels worse about damage to her reputation and self image than she does for kicking her daughter to the curb.

This can include overt verbal abuse such as yelling, screaming, or swearing. Such behaviors are attempts to gain power, and the goal is to control and intimidate you into submission\".    and at just a snarky comment and music being turned off.

You were.\n\nWhether other people think worse of your mother and step-father for that or worse of you because they're assuming you did something to deserve that, has more to do with their preconceptions than anything else.\n\nSometimes living with family as an adult is really hard.", "It\u2019s true, but it definitely seemed more like his problem than hers, and his ultimatum that you move out. But when you say it, you are painting them both with the same brush. Of course she went along with him, because she has to live with him after you\u2019re gone. You know it upsets her and I think you\u2019d agree that she doesn\u2019t 100% deserve it, so cut her a break and stop saying it.", "NTA. I've experienced more of an extreme version of this. I spent my childhood in and out of foster care and if I ever referred to my foster home my mom was quick to correct me and call it \"respite care.\" In Canada, foster care you are forcibly removed while respite care is voluntary. Now as an adult, I have the records and I know I was forcibly removed. My mom thinks it makes her look bad when I say I was in foster care.\n\nBut as a kid, this was incredibly invalidating. I felt like I couldn't talk about my experiences and my truth and it made me really confused about everything that happened. Took me a lot of therapy as an adult to say the word \"foster care\" and I still won't say it around my mom.\n\nUltimately, I am not responsible for my mom's shame and I need to live my truth and be honest. She needs to learn how to live with her decisions and how that impacted others. It sounds like you're experiencing something similar. You are NTA and the shame your mom feels is not your responsibility. Keep being honest.", "this is a very interesting post that speak volumes on society's view of women. You have a problem with your step dad and he's the reason you're out of the house, but you're blaming it on your mother?\n\nShe provided you a house when you had none, gave you opportunities to save money by footing most of your expenses (bc let's be real. $500/month is not enough to live independently and you're lucky to only pay that much.) and yet you call her a doormat. you use HER name instead of your stepdad's to say you're kicked out. And you're like what.. 27 years now and still don't know how to diffuse an arguerment with family?  The embarassment is real. I'm like... heartbroken for your mom to be honest, because ESH.\n\nI'm leaving with a quote. \u201cOften father and daughter look down on mother (woman) together. They exchange meaningful glances when she misses a point. They agree that she is not bright as they are, cannot reason as they do.
