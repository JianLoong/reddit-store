I asked my hubby if I could lay on top of him (non-sexual, just to cuddle, which we often do) and he said \"I don't want that right now.\" I asked \"why\" wondering if it was because he just didn't want to be squished right now. Instead of answering me, he responds \"Because I don't want you to.\" Naturally, I respond \"but WHY don't you want me to\" - now of course I respected his wishes and did **not** get on top of him. This was just a discussion about why. AITA for wondering why? He got upset with me because I wasn't accepting his answer. I gave the analogy \"if I ask why the sky is blue, I expected an explanation, or at least an \"I don't know\" rather than a blanket \"because its blue.\" He seems to indicate not everything needs an explanation. What do you think? It may be a minor argument, but it comes up a lot in our relationship. Various other contexts. Ex; \"Do you want to go to the park\" and he'll say \"No\" and I'll ask why and he will say \"because I don't want to\" and I'm supposed to just accept that answer. Is this my own neurosis?

You need to have a conversation with him to figure out how to communicate in a different way.

Accepting a \"no\" without further elaboration in the early stages of a relationship is reasonable. But you're married and your husband isn't communicating with you. You can't have a stable relationship without communication. \nWhat I would ask here is why he won't communicate his wishes.

Yes you\u2019re justified to your feelings, but so is he. No means no, in any context. By pushing for a response it could have felt like you were invalidating his feelings.

If you cuddle frequently then I highly doubt it has to deal with your weight, which I\u2019m guessing is what you feel like it is.", "No, EVERYTHING doesn't require an explanation. Sometimes you just don't feel like doing something. He shouldn't always be given the 3rd degree and made to justify his lack of desire to do something.\n\nHowever, if this is more about him consistently not wanting to do things with you, then that's a deeper issue. If he's constantly begging off doing things with you and not wanting to offer an explanation, then my assumption would he isn't that into you for some reason. Or maybe your expectations for certain things are too high or it's just about you being insecure.

A relationship doesn't grant you extra rights past someone's boundaries. Maybe all he really knows is that he just wasn't feeling like it. It doesn't have to be some deep psychological reason. \n\nThe answer is no. The reason why is because he said so. You're acting like a child, not a grown adult in a relationship.", "ESH. No is a full answer, and you should absolutely respect that.

I used to ask questions and try to rationalize why someone didn't want to answer them. It became annoying and I would push people away by this, especially partners. Sometimes, no means no.

In the example that you gave, are you expecting him to say, \"no I don't want you to lay on me because you weigh too much?\" Because you prefaced your question to AITA that you're a big girl. So are you looking for validation in your questions? If so, you need to stop. Your validation should come from within. You're putting way too much pressure on someone by continuously asking questions. Again I used to do the same thing.

I do feel like everybody has a right to say no in a relationship without a thought out explanation but attempting communication is never a Wrong thing to do. Every relationship Will be different, obviously, but they are about communicating your feelings with each other in the end of the day. My advice would be to talk this out with your husband, tell him why you acted the way you did, try to understand his sud\u00e9 and set rules for what both parties should do in such situation.

This is a communication issue you two need to meet in the middle on. He\u2019s allowed to say no without justifying himself just as you\u2019re allowed to be curious for answers.
