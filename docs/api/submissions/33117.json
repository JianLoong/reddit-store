A few days ago she asked me, 18F, to go out on a walk, mind you it\u2019s getting dark and it\u2019s well into the 7-8 o\u2019clock range, and I was the only one there at that moment to watch her. I said not today because it was dark and it was dangerous. Well, she didn\u2019t like that answer and kept pressing to go outside and after a few back and forth arguments, may the truth cometh forward, she reveals that she\u2019s going to go to a neighbor\u2019s house at the edge of the neighborhood. She was hiding the fact she was going to a stranger\u2019s house to introduce herself. This man is an elderly gentleman and my mother said he might need help time to time. My sister took that as her sign to walk, in the dark and alone, to go to his house and introduce herself to him. Now, I can understand how she wanted to help and I commend her for that, but she was going to go alone without anyone knowing so I got nervous. I told my dad the day it happened and he didn\u2019t give much concern. I then told my mother on the way home today and she said I didn\u2019t need to make it national news and then my sister started crying. I know how that might be embarrassing to have your mother be told you did something dumb, but I was the only \u201cadult\u201d there while my dad was out of the room and out of earshot, as well as my mom not even at the house.

After I told my mother, she said it was unnecessary to tell her and I didn\u2019t need to make it national news. It\u2019s her right to know, as her mother, that her youngest daughter was about to go out on her own to talk to an adult.

And while i'm sure she is a very sweet and smart child, she is a child. Going out at night is not a good idea at all. Even less of a good idea is to go to a stranger's house. Now in all fairness, this man could be a decent person and not harm her at all. But you never know and it's a risk she can't take.", "Agreed.  Especially for a little girl. Even frail old guys can be predators. You did a great job as the older sibling, doing what you thought was right.

When she gets older she will thank god nothing happened to her.  I felt the same way as a kid but didn\u2019t understand until much later.  We all do that\u2019s why adults and older people are there to help us", "No I get the whole walking to his house alone would be scary, although she asked you to go with her but maybe I\u2019m just confused on that part. I just don\u2019t see why you think you\u2019re the ah? I don\u2019t think your mom was trying to say you did something wrong or were an ah just that it was redundant and unneeded at that time.", "She didn\u2019t ask me to go with, she just asked if she could go on a walk. I didn\u2019t explain that part clearly so that\u2019s my fault. Our neighborhood is small so my parents let her go on a walk sometimes as long as she stays close to the house."]}
