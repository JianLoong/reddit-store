{"id": 12993, "submission_id": "11zdhlm", "title": "AITA for refusing to repair/replace my 13 year old daughter's iphone that she broke?", "selftext": "Context: I (32f) split up with my daughter \u2018Karla\u2019s (13f) father \u2018Bob\u2019 (54m) when she was about 11 months old. We were together 2 years. If you look at the ages and do a bit of math I\u2019m sure you can work out why I left. He has her on the weekends/holidays, and is the fun parent with more money. \n\nI got Karla a \u2018cheap\u2019 Samsung for $300 for her 11th birthday so we could stay in touch easier. At 12 she wanted an iPhone so Bob got her an older one, I was against it as it still cost $800 and I was worried she might break it since she\u2019s never been careful with her things. He told me he didn\u2019t expect me to replace it so what else could I do.\n\nKarla had no concerns. Her dad has always bought her stuff - she had so many toys and stuffed animals growing up that I filled up an entire shed with them. She never took care of her things because they just got replaced by him. \n\nWithin 6 months Karla broke the iPhone from dropping it, and the camera stopped working. She got so angry she threw it at the wall and it broke even worse. After many tantrums I offered to cover the cost of the front screen if Bob paid the rest. He ended up getting her a used one for $600.\n\nI didn't say anything when Karla kept dropping the replacement phone or throwing it onto her bed/the couch/tables when she got mad or just because she was was clumsy. She dropped it on an escalator once. The thing is never out of her hand unless she drops it. She cracked the corner the first week she got it because she didn't have a case on it. I had to force her to put a case on it because it wasn't \"cool\", but then a friend told her the case she got was cool, so then it was fine. \n\nApparently \"one of her friends\" dropped it. Sometimes when she called, all you could hear from her end is a continuous high pitched tone. It sounds like a demon in a supermarket pressing all the PA announcement buttons at once. But Karla loves to stay up late talking to her friends (I can\u2019t stop her or confiscate the phone bc she says her dad technically owns it, she threatens to call the police if I try it). She got so frustrated last night that nobody could hear her she threw her phone onto her bed and it bounced and hit the wall and now it's even worse.\n\nI refused to help fix it and Bob is saying if he can\u2019t get it replaced under insurance he won\u2019t either (I doubt that). Karla is freaking out. She can still text and take selfies but her argument is she \"Needs\" to talk to her friends, and what if there's an emergency and she has to call me or her dad? I am worried, but just fed up. She leaves her laptop (another Bob purchase) on the floor of her room all the time, refuses to let me clean it, so I'm sure she's going to step on it eventually. I am so frustrated but now I'm looking like the bad guy because I won't help, and Bob will look good when he inevitably replaces it under insurance or just buys a new one. \n\nSo reddit, AITA for refusing to help?", "created_utc": 1679559353, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11zdhlm/aita_for_refusing_to_repairreplace_my_13_year_old/", "score": 61, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It seems to me that she thinks she will get new things quicker if she breaks them faster. Only way you can stop this is by talking to your ex about him constantly gifting and enabling her but i doubt he will listen.", "NTA\n\nShe doesn't respect the value of the phone as it keeps getting replaced for her.\n\nBuy her the cheapest phone you can get so she can make emergency calls but not much else.  Then get her to do extra chores with a set payment for them and keep a tally of the money she earns.  Then after a time when she has earned enough get her a replacement.  Make it fair but don't make it too quick or she won't change.  \n\nShe needs to learn the value of things and should be inconvenienced by not having the phone so she appreciates it like she should.", "NTA - use her logic against her.

This is a good way to start.", "NTA at all! The age gap is so unsettling. Good for you that you got out of that situation OP. \nGosh Karla needs to learn responsibility and you are absolutely in the right to not get her iPhone fixed! Her dad is so wrong to just fulfill all her demands like this. It's not wrong to give your child better things but you have to teach them the value of it. You need to make sure that they are responsible. \nYou need to put your foot down and be firm about some matters. She clearly doesn't value anything she has and this is the perfect recipe for someone to grow up as an entitled adult. \n\n\n>her argument is she \"Needs\" to talk to her friends\n\nWhat she NEEDS is to learn from her mistakes and stop being so irresponsible!\n\nEdit: As far as needing the phone for emergencies, I think you should get her those sturdy nokia bricks or something cheap like that. The ones that aren't as lucrative as smartphones and are just there for communication purposes.", "NTA but your really need to tighten your parenting. This was hurtful to read how she\u2019s treating you.", "NTA\n\nI am so confused\u2026 you\u2019re the parent, why is your kid threatening to call the cops? Maybe let her and have them scare her straight about making false statements. Even if the phone does \u201clegally\u201d belong to your ex, you as the parent still have authority in your own home to limit or take away access to the phone. As long as your ex has a way to contact YOU about the child there is no need for them to have a phone. \n\nYou could also take the phone away completely and tell your ex that your daughter may only use the phone HE bought your daughter when she is with him, and when she is with you she will be using a $25 minute phone that you have purchased. \n\n\nReally this kid needs a giant attitude adjustment. She sounds like a spoiled brat, and I\u2019m guessing it\u2019s almost entirely your Ex\u2019s fault.", "NTA. You can offer to get her a cheap phone that will allow her to talk to her friends or call you in case of emergencies. If it's at all possible though, you and your ex need to have a coparent talk and be on the same page about this, otherwise she's never going to learn the value of money and how to look after her things.", "NTA Karla can either learn to take care of her phone or pay for its repair.  \n\nNeither you or her father are doing her any favours by continuing to repair breakage that was caused by her carelessness.  Further, neither of you should have to continue to pay for her mistakes.\n\nSure, Bob might repair eventually the phone this time, but there is essentially nothing you can do about Dairy Queen Dads who give in to their baby girls.  And even he will get weary of continuously repairing or replacing broken phones, tablets or other expensive electronic devices that she ruins.  \n\nThe real problem is your daughter is spoiled and demanding.  She expects to be able to not take care of her belongings and yet still have them replaced when they break down because of her mistreatement. She will have to make do or simply do without.  Yup, you'll be the meanie.  But if you do not put your foot down now, the cost of her repairs will only become more expensive...TV's, Computers, Cars, etc.", "NTA but you have to stop being scared of her and take a bit of control back. She's a 13 year old child, if you take her phone and she calls the police then so what?? They'll just laugh at her, it doesn't matter who bought her the phone; you're still her parent. (Also how is she going to call the police with no phone? Ha)\nStop worrying about not being the cool parent and just be the steady one, that's more valuable in the end.", "NTA but you need to get her a 20 dollar phone for emergency\u2019s", "NTA, don't get her any more replacements, she does not appreciate the value of things or how hard money is earned.\n\nGet her a $20-$30 brick phone for emergency calls only.", "NTA, she\u2019s a brat and fyi even an old phone without active service can make 911 calls.", "ESH.  You are bowing to the threats of a child.  Take away her phone, let her call the cops, throw a tantrum, etc.  Or just have it at Dad's house and she can use it on the weekends only", "NTA for not replacing the phone (as long as you maybe make sure she still can have a cheap one purely for communication with you if there are safety reasons to make that necessary).\n\nHowever, your parenting methods might need some work. It sounds like your daughter throws stuff around on the regular, and you don't even say anything about that? Maybe you meant specifically about the phone because it's on her if she breaks it, which I agree with, but I still can't imagine throwing stuff when I was young and my parents just sitting back and letting it happen. You might have bigger behavioral problems on your hands than just breaking a phone is all I'm saying.", "Side comment, 19 to 42!?!?!?! WTF", "NTA for refusing to repair the phone. \nYTA for letting your 13 yr old run you like a sewing machine. \nYes you can take her phone away at night, the police do not care.\nNo you don't have to replace her stuff she doesn't take care of.", "ESH it sounds like your daughter needs therapy.", "NTA, not having the phone replaced in the minute after she broke it will hopefully teach her a good lesson, plus since her dad insisted on getting her an iPhone without the proper protections (screen + case) then it\u2019s on them, not you", "No, NTA. That would be a natural consequence of her breaking the phone.\n\nFWIW - my 13 year old uses a $150 Motorola from Costco, and a cheap $10 case/glass screen protector. She\u2019s had it for a couple years and hasn\u2019t damaged it at all. \n\nGoing forward you could offer her to earn her cell phone repair through house work. She should be cleaning her own room, not you. She could be unloading the dishwasher, scooping kitty litter, taking out the trash, cooking dinner a few nights a week to earn the cost of the repair. If she\u2019s able to earn $50 a week towards the cost of the repair, she will value the stuff she has and treat it better.", "NTA\n\nThere is a thing called natural consequence.\nYou break it, then you don\u2019t have it anymore.\n\nYou and your ex have supplied her with one and a replacement one and neither were looked after and now she\u2019s learning about consequences.\n\nContacting friends is a want not a need. She can see them at school, and if she\u2019s missing out on what\u2019s happening with them because she doesn\u2019t have a phone, then that is a natural consequence. \n\nI\u2019d also get on the same page with you ex in regards to parenting so she doesn\u2019t try to play each of you against each other, and you both know what\u2019s happening. You\u2019re both old enough now to do this, 14 years ago was a different matter. \n\nI\u2019d also try to get some family counseling because she sounds very unhappy within herself.", "NTA. You're handling this perfectly, btw. My 16yo still uses an iPhone 6 because I refuse to buy a new one after replacing the screen 3 times. It's on her, cracks and all.\n\nFor starters, let little missy know that the police will NOT appreciate that waste of police resources, as you can most definitely pick that phone up at your house and return it when she leaves. Get that crap nipped in the bud ASAP.\n\nYou've done good here. The ball is clearly in your ex's court. His idea, his responsibility. He's an idiot if he gives her another phone, but not your problem.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
