I have always appreciated that he tells me the truth.\u00a0We adopted two cats, bought a really lovely flat.\n\nAfter lockdowns lifted it seemed he\u2019d lost some of his spark.

We\u2019ve been talking about having a baby.\n\nAbout six months back, I could feel him revive. I was so happy. We went out more, he noticed my own efforts and looking after himself better.\n\nToday, I got an alert from our joint account for $130 to \u201cTell Xanthe.\u201d I texted him, he apologised, as it was meant to be from personal.\u00a0\n\nI was at work and bored so I googled\u2026Turns out, it\u2019s some woman, not far from where I work. She \u201clends a sympathetic ear to men who need it\u201d I saw red.\n\nI went to the address down a cool painted laneway. Took a pic and textedJames.

I\u2019m so glad you came by. That little frog on your lapel is adorable! Is that the one he bought for your birthday?\u201d\u00a0\n\nShe disarmed me, I\u2019d been ready to fight. She explained she was something like a life coach. That she specialises in men, after a friend who is a sex worker told her that most of her clients just want someone nice to talk to without any worries.Says it\u2019s less formal than therapy, and she refers ppl when they\u2019re \u201cbeyond her pay grade\u201d and supports them through the process. Sometimes she\u2019ll cook with them or get them potting plants or dabbling in paints. It helps them open up. On Friday nights she hosts mixers and said she\u2019s been encouraging James to bring me, that it\u2019s her friends and clients and their friends. She said her services are platonic, just a hug if it\u2019s wanted. I thought she was young, but she said she\u2019s 43 and talks like it. She has a partner and a teenager.

Ha.   \n\n\n\\[hic\\]\n\nYou fool.", "2/10\n\nMust try harder", "NTA. You going there should not have ruined anything, as Xanthe has been encouraging him to bring you along. If your husband needs it to be hidden from you in order to enjoy it then he needs to look within himself as to why that would be the case.", "NTA exactly but you might want to try asking your husband what is going on before playing FBI. I can understand your concerns, though. Glad this is working for him and hopefully he continues to have good experiences when going and can take you with him soon. Best of luck OP", "NTA. She sounds nice.", "ESH. He should not have kept this hidden from you, but the way you are looking at this whole thing is weird. The fact that you called her geisha in the title is so ??? This is not a sex worker or anything of the sort. It's literally just unlicensed (I think) talk therapy. Just because it is a woman doesn't make it something to be jealous about. I understand you were taken aback but honestly I don't see anything wrong about this situation on his behalf other than he didnt tell you.", "If you want her life build it for yourself, don't disparage her for having what you want. YTA for attempting to confront someone other than your husband about his suspected infidelity.", "A very soft NTA.\n\nIf I remember what geishas do correctly then it is a beautiful art form.  And it is nothing to be concerned about.  I think they even have a ceremony to thank the wives of the men who they talk to.  But a Japanese person is a MUCH better person to explain this than me of course.\n\nThe only reason I\u2019m not going with NAH is because James should have told you.  There\u2019s nothing wrong with this but not communicating it makes it seem shadier than it is.  He should have just told you.  I\u2019m not THAT mad at him for it but it is kinda shitty.", "You do trust him, but did the whole google, confront etc thing. It was helping him be a better partner, and it is private. smh I hope you have not damaged your relationship beyond repair. YTAH.", "NTA - I get it. You thought he was doing something untoward, I really cant blame you for looking into it. \n\nIt does sound a little, different, but I can see how this is helpful for people.", "[deleted]", "NAH - I'm glad that Xanthe is making a positive impact on James.  Sometimes an outside perspective on life is immensely helpful and inspiring.\n\nMaybe take her up on the offer to go to one of the mixers with James to show support.\n\nThey really should have more Xanthess around during these modern times, many people not actualizing their lives and living with depression and anxiety.", "NAH.\n\nI think she is great - i think you guys have done nothing wrong.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

He's probably feeling like you bursted the bubble of this being 'his time'  \n\nIt's a bit weird and unconventional.  But if it works, and you don't feel bad about what she did for him, why fight it. \n\nMaybe be a bit apologetic (even though you don't need to apologize for your action with the info you had at the time), and be positive when he returns.", "Info: So was your husband lying to her? Cause if we take what she says at face value, she had no idea he was hiding her from you. And it's not like the subject of you and more specifically of you meeting her hadn't come up. Or did she know he was hiding you and she was glad you accidentally learned the truth?\n\nThe fact that your husband didn't tell you he had been seeing this unlicensed therapist/life coach, that he was lying to her (or was she putting up a front to you?), his reaction to you going there, your fear that you've ruined everything... All of this doesn't bode well. You say everything has been perfect the past few months but your husband can't talk to you.\n\nIn any case, he told you he needed to think. So no, don't go find him.", "YTA. Instead of going to her place fully intending to argue and be mean, you should've talked to your husband. Trust, respect, and communication are the 3 cornerstones of a solid relationship. You failed with all 3. I understand that you were sort of blindsided by the relationship your husband has with this woman, but at your age you should know better. Next time something makes you doubt someone's loyalty, honesty, etc, try talking to them instead of snooping around behind their back. This isn't middle school.", "Why the word \"geisha\" in your title?\n\nSeems kind of racist.", "Ohhhhhhh. Thank you for that. Of course she\u2019s probably been through this before. I just guess I feel like especially the past few months everything is pretty perfect and I was terrified it was all a lie and freaked out. But you\u2019re right I bet. I gotta go find James.", "I mean, maybe. But he tells me the truth even if it is inconvenient or hurts my feelings. And I appreciate that. I do the same. But it\u2019s not like I knew about this or how to even ask what it is.", "Yeah, that\u2019s the part I feel most shit about. I was just shocked, she was so pretty and I thought oh Jesus he HAS had a spring in his step lately\u2026 and bc she wasn\u2019t far from me I just acted in the moment.", "Totally. I didn\u2019t accuse her of anything, just walked up fuming and was almost immediately chilled right out. Maybe she\u2019s a witch or something. I did like her. No disparaging. The more I think about it, men\u2019s mental health is a huge issue so maybe she\u2019s onto something. \n\nThe funny thing is, her place (studio? Office) isn\u2019t a whole lot different to mine. Comfy and sorta maximalist. She\u2019s just got more room to spread out her projects I guess.", "Yeah, that\u2019s why I use the word. There was something very cultivated and otherworldly about her and her place. It felt special and deliberate. \n\nI\u2019ve spent time in Japan, I wasn\u2019t using the word as a synonym for sex worker.", "I was using a character counter that wasn\u2019t the one linked. Then finally used the linked one and it counted things differently.", "Yeah, I agree. The cooler I get, the more I agree and I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t blow up his phone with my what the hell thoughts. I hope I didn\u2019t ruin it, I dunno. I might get off reddit and go find him.", "Yeah for sure. I googled cause I thought maybe it was some cool experience and I could find us a restaurant or bar nearby to hit up. We\u2019re usually seeking out stuff like that. Like, suspicion or snooping was the last thing on my mind, but you\u2019re right. And I know him, I should have said something but instead I just went to check it out.", "Well, no. I lived in Japan for a while with my brother who has become a citizen. I learned that the geisha there was like an entertaining woman who isn\u2019t your wife and usually it\u2019s not sexual either. It was the closest concept I could come up with.", "I would have totally assumed that she was a sex worker too. \n\nGood luck.", "you didn't accuse her to her face but you know damn well why you went there fuming, your anger was misplaced at that point. \n\nI'm sincerely glad your assumptions were incorrect. Men's mental health is something that desperately needs destigmatized. \n\nApologize to your husband for assuming the worst and talk to him about joining him at the mixers, maybe you could get a friend out of all this", "You said you were ready for a fight.", "And I was kinda rattled and going on tangents.", "I was literally just talking about how people do not understand what geisha's are not even an hour ago!", "Okay.  I accept your explanation.  I lived in Japan for several years.  Folks always get geisha mixed up with prostitute.", "NAH, in my opinion. OP was not an asshole; based on the unconventional nature of this therapy and her husband's secretive attitude about it, her suspicions were prudent. OP can't be held responsible when details were deliberately concealed.\n\nOP wisely revised her suspicions when offered the truth, and that's all we can ask of them."]}
