He's probably feeling like you bursted the bubble of this being 'his time'  \n\nIt's a bit weird and unconventional.  But if it works, and you don't feel bad about what she did for him, why fight it. \n\nMaybe be a bit apologetic (even though you don't need to apologize for your action with the info you had at the time), and be positive when he returns.", "Info: So was your husband lying to her? Cause if we take what she says at face value, she had no idea he was hiding her from you. And it's not like the subject of you and more specifically of you meeting her hadn't come up. Or did she know he was hiding you and she was glad you accidentally learned the truth?\n\nThe fact that your husband didn't tell you he had been seeing this unlicensed therapist/life coach, that he was lying to her (or was she putting up a front to you?), his reaction to you going there, your fear that you've ruined everything... All of this doesn't bode well. You say everything has been perfect the past few months but your husband can't talk to you.\n\nIn any case, he told you he needed to think. So no, don't go find him.", "YTA. Instead of going to her place fully intending to argue and be mean, you should've talked to your husband. Trust, respect, and communication are the 3 cornerstones of a solid relationship. You failed with all 3. I understand that you were sort of blindsided by the relationship your husband has with this woman, but at your age you should know better. Next time something makes you doubt someone's loyalty, honesty, etc, try talking to them instead of snooping around behind their back. This isn't middle school.", "Why the word \"geisha\" in your title?\n\nSeems kind of racist.", "Ohhhhhhh. Thank you for that. Of course she\u2019s probably been through this before. I just guess I feel like especially the past few months everything is pretty perfect and I was terrified it was all a lie and freaked out. But you\u2019re right I bet. I gotta go find James.", "I mean, maybe. But he tells me the truth even if it is inconvenient or hurts my feelings. And I appreciate that. I do the same. But it\u2019s not like I knew about this or how to even ask what it is.", "Yeah, that\u2019s the part I feel most shit about. I was just shocked, she was so pretty and I thought oh Jesus he HAS had a spring in his step lately\u2026 and bc she wasn\u2019t far from me I just acted in the moment.", "Totally. I didn\u2019t accuse her of anything, just walked up fuming and was almost immediately chilled right out. Maybe she\u2019s a witch or something. I did like her. No disparaging. The more I think about it, men\u2019s mental health is a huge issue so maybe she\u2019s onto something. \n\nThe funny thing is, her place (studio? Office) isn\u2019t a whole lot different to mine. Comfy and sorta maximalist. She\u2019s just got more room to spread out her projects I guess.", "Yeah, that\u2019s why I use the word. There was something very cultivated and otherworldly about her and her place. It felt special and deliberate. \n\nI\u2019ve spent time in Japan, I wasn\u2019t using the word as a synonym for sex worker.", "I was using a character counter that wasn\u2019t the one linked.

The cooler I get, the more I agree and I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t blow up his phone with my what the hell thoughts. I hope I didn\u2019t ruin it, I dunno. I might get off reddit and go find him.", "Yeah for sure. I googled cause I thought maybe it was some cool experience and I could find us a restaurant or bar nearby to hit up. We\u2019re usually seeking out stuff like that. Like, suspicion or snooping was the last thing on my mind, but you\u2019re right. And I know him, I should have said something but instead I just went to check it out.", "Well, no. I lived in Japan for a while with my brother who has become a citizen.

Men's mental health is something that desperately needs destigmatized. \n\nApologize to your husband for assuming the worst and talk to him about joining him at the mixers, maybe you could get a friend out of all this", "You said you were ready for a fight.", "And I was kinda rattled and going on tangents.", "I was literally just talking about how people do not understand what geisha's are not even an hour ago!", "Okay.  I accept your explanation.  I lived in Japan for several years.  Folks always get geisha mixed up with prostitute.", "NAH, in my opinion. OP was not an asshole; based on the unconventional nature of this therapy and her husband's secretive attitude about it, her suspicions were prudent. OP can't be held responsible when details were deliberately concealed.\n\nOP wisely revised her suspicions when offered the truth, and that's all we can ask of them.", "NTA. What were you supposed to think? Who in the hell would have thought that\u2019s what this was?", "Nta. You were initially concerned and angry about a possibility, but you went about it all the right ways. You could have made assumptions, but every step of the way, you stayed calm and avoided jumping to conclusions. There are plenty of women who would have done just those things. Tell him that while there you were slightly paranoid, you didn't think he'd be disloyal to you and simply wanted to see what this lady was about as he felt it was necessary to hide it. Make it clear that you're supportive of these visits and that when he's comfortable you'd be willing to take up xanthes offer for a meet up since she seems like a wonderful lady who wants to help people.", "NTA- even if he was going to a normal therapist he should have told you. $130 per appt isn\u2019t a small chunk of change coming from your joint account, and you have a right to know that your partner who you are planning on having a baby with is seeking help with mental health.\n\nThere\u2019s a reason he didn\u2019t tell you, because even if she seems amazing\u2026wtf? How did he find her? Would you have been cool with this if you knew from the beginning? It\u2019s nice that it\u2019s working but\u2026I would feel emotionally cheated a little bit and lied to", "NTA. He shouldn\u2019t have hidden it. I would have thought the same exact thing, it\u2019s not like she\u2019s a licensed therapist.", "You are good in fictional writing, did you think about writing a book?", "NTA, this is pretty basic mate guarding stuff.  You have a right to look into something that could have fundamentally changed how you viewed the relationship.", "this read like an advertisement for whatever this Xanthe is.", "So she's his paid escort, basically. I don't care how charismatic she is (if she immediately charmed you too) it boils down to her being paid to be friends.\n\nI will never be fond of those professions but like you say--they exist because people are lonely. I'm not going to make a judgement here.", "NAH - this is very weird but you should be happy I think. \n\nI think this is an okay thing and maybe you should allow him the space to continue seeing her and just not ask about it again, she sounds lovely. \n\nCan you really see her schtupping your husband and everyone else's?", "NTA. You needed information and got it. Do NOT confront him for a while, at least. My guess is that he is considering telling you now. Let him.", "NTA, but you *might* ruin this. If you think this is OK and even good for him, then it seems like it might be important to let him know, and that you appreciated and enjoyed the way life's returned to him recently.\n\nBut he also might be kind of wondering why he can't get that kind of support from *you*, his wife. Maybe you should be wondering why you weren't able to give it, I dunno. Maybe you've stumbled into the first thing your husband, as a person, has actually felt *vulnerable* about and it sounds like you might not have any practice dealing with that.", "NTA but also, if she gets her clients referred from the sex worker... is that how he found her, too?", "This seems like an advert.", "I disagree. $130 is a lot to spend without telling your wife and I'm going to assume that he is also spending a significant amount of time with her that he should have told his wife about. Going out to \"think\" as if this wouldn't have been an issue had he said something is ridiculous to me, and I can't believe she said she's hoping \"she\" didn't ruin it.", "Therapy without the \"T\" word that makes people sound like basket cases is probably an addressable market.", "OP said in some comments that she didn\u2019t mean it as sex worker, she\u2019s aware of what geishas actually do and intended for the real meaning.", "If it was \"Xanthe therapists Ltd\" with a waiting room would you feel the improvement was all a lie too?\n\nSome people may feel less stigma going to a prostitute than a psychologist even if they really need the latter not the former.\n\nThe only thing that is bad is why he thought he needed to hide it from you. Try to focus on communication long term, but otherwise embrace the experience, it seems eye-opening from your description.", "There is nothing necessarily wrong with enjoying the attention of an attractive person. \n\nImagine you got to spend time with a *very* handsome and invested, engaged listener, I wouldn't turn it down.", "> The more I think about it, men\u2019s mental health is a huge issue so maybe she\u2019s onto something.\n\nI'm not sure how the second follows from the first. You mean men's mental health is an untapped market so more women should see the business opportunity? \n\nI think that men's mental health (and mental health in general) is an issue that should be taken seriously. Professionally. Xanthe sounds great, so I'm not talking about her case specifically, but surely, you realize not every \"provider\" will be like that and you can see the risk of abuse and taking advantage that exist when there are no qualifications required beyond being an attractive woman, no ethical norms (around privacy and boundaries, among other things), and no oversight whatsoever.", "She's not a sex worker. Nothing physical, just emotional affairs.", "Reads like a script specially your \" description of the room\" which is what, a nod to the set director lol?", "You have NOTHING to apologize for.\n\n**Be it a therapist or a Life Coach, HE SHOULD HAVE TOLD YOU!.**\n\nI use to see a therapist. My husband supported me, he was my cheerleader. Never asked me what we talked about, was just there to listen if I wanted to talk about a session. \n\nListen, you deserved to know as his wife/life partner. Especially if this person is unlicensed...", "NTA - the fact that he's doing something so emotionally intimate and didn't tell you is cause enough for you to be suspicious.

If this was legit he'd tell you", "NTA. But weird AH.", "I worked as a dominatrix for quite a while. It absolutely is a real thing. Sex wasn\u2019t a service we offered or one that was asked for.

Not all men have ulterior motives, some are just extremely insecure about finding and using mental health services.\n\n\nI hate how everyone jumps to \"this guy is a bad guy\". Men's mental health has, and continues to be a major taboo in society.\n\nTry giving someone some credit here. The guy actively sought out help when he was in a personal crisis. That's pretty admirable.", "Men in our current society seem to feel the most stigmatized for seeking mental health help and keeping it 100% personal can give them the space to heal without being scared of being judged. I'd honestly be happier that he's getting some form of help, I'd even talk to him about budgeting it as a joint expense since I would deem it medical. I understand hiding stuff seems sus, but when I say the stigma makes men RUN from therapy, I'm starting my 4th year of my psych undergrad at age 33, I see the stats...this makes complete sense. Also, makes sense that OP went and checked it out since yeah, it was sus...but I wouldn't be too concerned past that. It's embarrassing in western culture for men to seek help...it SHOULDN'T be, as they have the right to seek the help they need and be free from judgement too...But that doesn't change how societal pressures affect men and therapy. If my husband were hiding something from me and it was simply unconventional therapy, I'd be proud of him for seeking help and just encourage him to feel safe and not judged talking to me about it...also, I would not breathe a WORD to another soul...no matter what. But bravo to James for getting help in the first place...it's tough to do!", "Definitely needs a spell checker so I'm guessing it wasn't AI that did it. Yeah, OP, try Wattpad.", "That depends. He meant to process it from his personal account not the joint one, which sounds to me like they have some amount of money that they can do whatever they want with. If this is what he wants to do with his money that is separate from their joint finances that's one thing. But if he was spending \"their\" money that's where things would be problematic IMO.", "I\u2019m a MHP now but back in the day I did the dungeon run. Guys get weird about anything from personal thoughts to kinks to just wishes. The higher the social expectations, the weirder they tend to get about anything that makes them look weak. So there is a chance that he feels like this was a violation. I don\u2019t necessarily agree with the hiding, but I\u2019ve seen it a lot.", "I didn't even imply that \"this guy is a bad guy\". You have jumped to your own conclusions.", "Japanese geisha certainly are practicing an art, but don\u2019t fool yourself into thinking they don\u2019t do sex work.

I only asked if OP's perception of the improvement depends on the establishment. \n\nYour description of regulation and legality applies specifically to the US, it's not universal and not necessarily perfect.\n\nFor some reason OP's husband was not attracted by insurance and regulation to seek licensed help. I think I would stick to the trained and educated therapists but I am open to the idea that I may be wrong.", "It has nothing to do with the fact that he\u2019s a man? He made it a personal luxury when he hid it from her. If the roles were reversed it would be the same even though she\u2019s a woman", "The person I was replying to said that \"130$ is a lot to spend without telling your wife\".\n\nI was just replying that spending any money, for any reason, from a joint account without his wife's knowledge would be problematic. If money is being spent from a joint account both parties should know that it's being spent and what it's for. But any money he spends from a personal account has nothing to do with his wife, it's his money (assuming what he does with the money doesn't in some way break any of the rules of engagement of their marriage, but then the issue is what he's doing, not the money spent).\n\nI never said anything about the fact that the money was for mental health expenses. He chose to pay for the therapy out of his personal finances, presumably so that his wife wouldn't find out either because he's ashamed or because he assumed she would not react well, which means he is free to spend the money and not run it by her first.  If he had chosen to spend their joint money and not tell her about it, that would have been a different situation (and he would have been outed immediately as was the case when he accidentally paid from the wrong account)", "Pointing again to don\u2019t necessarily agree with- HOWEVER, everyone needs something. We all have something that\u2019s ours. I find that black and white view of \u2018it\u2019s not right because I don\u2019t like it\u2019 pops up a lot in controlling relationships and often is the base reason men hide it. \n\nThe people in our lives have expectations of us. Someone in her position doesn\u2019t.", "No. This is inappropriate. He hid it from his wife and when she checked up needs time to think. That says it's not something legit.", "Hiding it from his wife is the only thing that's inappropriate. Men still face a lot of societal pressure to never see a therapist and never talk about their issues. It sounds like she was helping him quite a bit, and even OP was impressed by how she spoke about it.\n\nIf you truly feel situations like these constitute emotional affairs, I seriously suggest speaking to a therapist about any trust issues you might have.", "It is absolutely inappropriate for a married man to have a confidante that's neither his wife nor a licensed therapist. \n\nMy guess is they divorce because this is sketchy af. If it wasn't sketchy he wouldn't hide it", "There's not much of a difference between a therapist and her. What she provides is actually beneficial and less informal than a therapist and is more like a friend. As far as we know, OP's husband isn't talking about inappropriate things with the geisha therapist.", "I think, every once in a while, a person needs privacy of sorts. Even when you are married, you are still your own person and i think some times we just need a place that is distant from our lives.\n\nDont get me wrong. I still believe he should have told her about it. But i can understand his reasoning. As you said and as op tought this seems sketchy. But if there is no evidence of cheating, and i dont think there is a romantic emotion in this relationship of theirs, divorce is just overreacting. A couples therapy would definitely be nice tough."]}
