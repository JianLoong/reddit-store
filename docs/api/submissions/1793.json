If after a while you can look past it and remember the better times before she got sick, then maybe you can add it later, but again it is totally up to you and no one else gets to decide what you have tattooed on your body.", "What you're doing with tattoos is breathtakingly beautiful. NTA for not wanting to get one for your grandmother.

Maybe someday you'll actually be ready for such a tattoo. And maybe not. For today, it doesn't matter.\n\nNTA.", "NTA - The dementia means it wasn't her fault, but you can't exactly just forget what she said and did. And having a tattoo on your body for her would be a daily, painful reminder of it", "NTA. I hope you're seeking counseling for the harm your grandmother's condition made her cause to you. Your family are all a bunch of A Hs and I hope they get it someday, but they probably never will. You're so young to have someone you love, respect and admire be so cruel (yes, I know it was the dementia) and I think your parents should have protected you from that better. *EDIT: I guess I've been on too long, I thought you posted your age as 19, but now I see no age. Regardless, this was a very painful experience for you and your family needs to stfu about their opinions. Your body, your choice.*", "NTA.

Period. \n\nI will say while I understand your pain, someone with growing dementia doesn\u2019t understand the difference between reality and imagination. My grandfather had Alzheimer\u2019s and before my grandmother would finally let us get him help he said and did awful things to different family members. He became a different person, partly out of fear because he didn\u2019t understand what was happening and partly out of the growing disease. If you were close with your grandmother before, try not to focus on the things she said and did at the end. I know it\u2019s hard, took me over a decade to reconcile the loving guy I knew from the person he became before getting treatment. Best wishes.", "Moving her twice wasn't the best idea. With all the changes in her environment she must have been really confused and with dementia, she got more aggressive. If she was a good grandmother and did not play favorites before her sickness maybe you should consider including her, but it is up to you. All the relatives giving your family grief over that are the AH though. The accusations were outlandish and it is hard to be the caretaker, why didn't they volunteer to take her in the first place? They should have understood the situation, sympathized with you, told you about her disturbing behavior, and help to make proper arrangements for her.", "NTA\nYou can get what tattoos you want. But I knew she had dementia way before you said it. My mom has it too. The first sign was her telling me and anyone who would listen that I used a key and went to her house while they were out to dinner and stole a necklace. Of course that hurt because it was ridiculous. I don\u2019t care that much about jewelry and I\u2019m licensed, bonded and insured because I\u2019m in charge of other peoples money. I would never steal anything because SHE taught me better. \n\nYou have to remember that she wasn\u2019t really your grandmother by then. It sounds like she treated you the worst which tells me she loved you the most. You need time to grieve in your own way. It might help to do some research on dementia and Alzheimer\u2019s and then you will see it wasn\u2019t you at all. My mom is now in a nursing home. She remembers me but not my name. \n\nThen completely separately my dad was just awful to me. I decided I wasn\u2019t going to to speak to him anymore. But then I found out he had brain tumors and brain cancer. So of course I forgave him and tried to be there for him as much as I could. My parents divorced when I was 4 so these two things were not related. \n\nI think you should have something of hers that reminds you of her in a good way. There\u2019s no law or anything that you have to get a tattoo. That\u2019s personal to you.", "NTA.

Knowing what I know now, she was showing signs of it for about 20 years prior to her diagnosis.  \n\nMom went through periods where she was certain one of my sisters had put rat poison in her water pipes.  Or she was trying to move her to a home so she could sell her house out from under her.  Or she was stealing from her.  Or she was sneaking into the house late at night and standing over her with a knife while she slept ... it was drama central!  And it just kept escalating.  And mom got more and more paranoid and made more and more outrageous claims!\n\nWhen the accusations first started (moving mom into a home so my sister could sell her house), it was plausible.  My sister was having huge financial issues and I personally could see her doing something like that.  I don't get along with this sister so I leaned towards believing mom.  But as mom's accusations got more bizarre, it was obvious what was going on. \n\nWe were told to not tell her she was wrong but to redirect her and get her mind off her fixation.  My other sister who lived with her would not follow these instructions which resulted in some hellatious fights.  It was 10 years of hell.  Mom would tell tall tales to the doctors, the pharmacist, store clerks, the neighbors ... it was awful - we got so many dirty looks from people who believed her. \n\nMom passed away a few months ago.  In her obituary and funeral program, we mentioned her long fight with dementia, hallucinations and her deteriorating mental status.  These people who came to the visitation apologized to my sisters but the damage has been done.  As we close up her estate, we've lost the tie to the house my sisters grew up in and I spent most of my childhood in.  Before, when we talked about it, we wanted to keep it in the family.  Not now.
