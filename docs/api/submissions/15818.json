Thermal paste doesn't cost that much.

I wouldnt redo thermal paste before selling something used\n\nIm leaning on either they dont know what theyre doing or they scammy\n\nI wouldnt bend", "NTA it sounds like a scam. If you want to bother responding, tell him \u201cwe do not to partial refunds, please send the order back to us and then we\u2019ll issue you a refund in full\u201d\n\nI doubt you\u2019ll hear back", "NTA;  does sound like a scam.  I'm not sure how ebay works, but if he does leave a bad review - I wonder if you can report him for trying to blackmail you into giving him money back?\n\nAs is means as is.", "NTA - sold as seen and a fair price are the clues, maybe get ahead of the buyer and send eBay the correspondence/raise a report yourself? Good luck.", "NTA. Part of the reason used items are sold for great prices are because there's always some level of assumption that they may not be in perfect condition, and that sometimes repairs may be needed. You marked it \"sold as is\" and sold it for a low cost to accommodate for the fact it's a well-used part.\n\nIf the buyer wants to avoid potential issues concerning failure or repair, they really ought to buy new instead of used, he's foolish for expecting you to give him $20 for repairs on a \"sold as is\" used item.", "NTA. Sold as is. If he wanted a new card the buyer should have bought one.\n\nINFO: I'm not familiar with AMD GPUs, but wouldn't he have to take it (partially) apart to inspect the thermal paste? Or how did he determine is needed this?", "You sold a used product as is.  Don't give him any money.  Don't even talk to him again.", "NTA.  Sold as is, and buyer accepted these terms when he bid on it.  Hes just trying his luck.", "NTA. Sold as is for better or worse.", "NTA\n\nSounds like a scam. \n\nReiterate that is was sold \u201cas is\u201d, keep copies of all correspondence. \n\nHe\u2019s trying to bilk you out of money.", "NTA, and buyer needs to learn to read.  Caveat emptor!", "Don\u2019t engage any further, go straight to eBay and report the buyer. It\u2019s a scam.\n\nNTA", "NTA. You weren\u2019t selling it as new. And you said \u201cas is\u201d", "NTA You wrote \"as is\". It sounds like the buyer is trying to blackmail you.", "NTA\n\nThis is a common practice people use to try and get stuff cheaper. It's one thing if the item was damaged in shipping or not as described. This would be at best the normal expectation for a used product and they never asked questions correct? You didn't list it as refurbished and it arrived in a functional state. \n\nThey just took it upon themselves to do it, though there is no proof they did that. You aren't responsible for their life choices. \n\nWorst part is this is going to be an uphill battle if he intends to get ebay involved who often sides with buyers.

You should probably report the interaction to eBay.", "Sold as is implies that there might be faults, thus its on the buyer to do any repairs.", "Please report the buyer to eBay for extortion.

Ebay won't do shit to you. \n\nNTA", "Nta. I use eBay a lot and the buyers messages are actually against eBay\u2019s rules. If he leaves bad feedback you can report him and get the bad feedback removed because he tried to blackmail you. It\u2019s specifically against the rules to demand money for good feedback.", "NTA and contact ebay customer service. They won't allow him to post (remove) the negative review if everything is as described.", "NTA, but make sure you handle this correctly. When you respond to him, keep in mind that your response will be used by eBay to determine the results of his claim (if he files). Write your response specifically thinking that someone at eBay will be reading it.\n\nExplain that the sale was as-is. Then also explain that the buyer obviously disassembled the card, which would have voided any warranty had one existed. Take it from there.", "If you put sold as is, then you're covered. Absolutely NTA. \n\nI sell on ebay and had a customer try to get a refund because the product wasn't silicone. I had advertised it as vinyl. She also said it didn't look like the pictures but my photos were exactly the same.  I said no. She said 'You might not want to give me a refund but ebay will make you'. I pointed out ebay only give refunds if I mis-described the product, which I did not do. Ebay sided with me.\n\nIf you put 'sold as is' on a 2nd hand product, you should not have to issue a partial refund. Let ebay sort it out. They will most likely side with you.", "$4 for new tube if paste $16 for his personal time\n\nYeah totaL mad bs", "I wouldnt offer a full refund.  Dude could send back a totally fucked up gpu and op would have offered a refund.  Nah too risky", "Yes, he would. By taking off the heat sink that would have the thermal paste between it and the cpu/gpu. Taking the heat sink off to inspect the thermal paste = redoing the thermal paste. For pretty much any chip you'd use a heat sink on.\n\nThermal paste is just a highly heat conductive material used to ensure a good thermal contact between a chip and heat sink (or other cooling hardware that requires direct contact). If you remove the heat sink, even if just to inspect the paste, you really should just replace the paste. It's not going to reseat right after its been on there a while, and its only a few dollars (as others have mentioned).\n\nPlus, most video cards come with all of their cooling setup, including any heatsink that uses thermal paste (and the paste), pre-installed at the factory,. People can modify that cooling setup, but unless you're a heavy system customizer, why bother. Sure, thermal paste can go bad, but its a lot more likely to be an issue when done by average joe at home than by the factory.\n\nAs to how to determine that the paste might need replacing? By monitoring the temperature readings off the video card while using the computer. The same temps that OP said have always been good.\n\nThis really is an \"if it ain't broke, don't fix it\" scenario. And why multiple people are saying the buyer sounds like a scammer.\n\nOP is NTA."]}
