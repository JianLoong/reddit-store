Good luck.", "NTA. Part of the reason used items are sold for great prices are because there's always some level of assumption that they may not be in perfect condition, and that sometimes repairs may be needed. You marked it \"sold as is\" and sold it for a low cost to accommodate for the fact it's a well-used part.\n\nIf the buyer wants to avoid potential issues concerning failure or repair, they really ought to buy new instead of used, he's foolish for expecting you to give him $20 for repairs on a \"sold as is\" used item.", "NTA. Sold as is. If he wanted a new card the buyer should have bought one.\n\nINFO: I'm not familiar with AMD GPUs, but wouldn't he have to take it (partially) apart to inspect the thermal paste?

Sold as is, and buyer accepted these terms when he bid on it.  Hes just trying his luck.", "NTA. Sold as is for better or worse.", "NTA\n\nSounds like a scam. \n\nReiterate that is was sold \u201cas is\u201d, keep copies of all correspondence. \n\nHe\u2019s trying to bilk you out of money.", "NTA, and buyer needs to learn to read.

And you said \u201cas is\u201d", "NTA You wrote \"as is\". It sounds like the buyer is trying to blackmail you.", "NTA\n\nThis is a common practice people use to try and get stuff cheaper. It's one thing if the item was damaged in shipping or not as described. This would be at best the normal expectation for a used product and they never asked questions correct? You didn't list it as refurbished and it arrived in a functional state. \n\nThey just took it upon themselves to do it, though there is no proof they did that. You aren't responsible for their life choices. \n\nWorst part is this is going to be an uphill battle if he intends to get ebay involved who often sides with buyers.

You should probably report the interaction to eBay.", "Sold as is implies that there might be faults, thus its on the buyer to do any repairs.", "Please report the buyer to eBay for extortion. Mention that he threatened you that unless you give him 20$ he's going to leave bad reviews and create a fraudulent case against you. \n\n\nNTA", "NTA. \u201cSold as is\u201d means EXACTLY that.", "NTA. Buyer would have no legitimate cause for complaint even if the card was 100% stone dead. As-is mean as-is.", "NTA. Thermal paste is pretty much a given when installing anything in a computer that will get heat. This was an expected expense.", "They're probably some nerd who's friend told them if it wasn't repasted they got ripped off. \n\nFuck em. They bought it as described. Ebay won't do shit to you. \n\nNTA", "Nta. I use eBay a lot and the buyers messages are actually against eBay\u2019s rules. If he leaves bad feedback you can report him and get the bad feedback removed because he tried to blackmail you. It\u2019s specifically against the rules to demand money for good feedback.", "NTA and contact ebay customer service. They won't allow him to post (remove) the negative review if everything is as described.", "NTA, but make sure you handle this correctly. When you respond to him, keep in mind that your response will be used by eBay to determine the results of his claim (if he files). Write your response specifically thinking that someone at eBay will be reading it.\n\nExplain that the sale was as-is. Then also explain that the buyer obviously disassembled the card, which would have voided any warranty had one existed. Take it from there.", "If you put sold as is, then you're covered. Absolutely NTA. \n\nI sell on ebay and had a customer try to get a refund because the product wasn't silicone. I had advertised it as vinyl. She also said it didn't look like the pictures but my photos were exactly the same.  I said no. She said 'You might not want to give me a refund but ebay will make you'. I pointed out ebay only give refunds if I mis-described the product, which I did not do. Ebay sided with me.\n\nIf you put 'sold as is' on a 2nd hand product, you should not have to issue a partial refund. Let ebay sort it out. They will most likely side with you.", "$4 for new tube if paste $16 for his personal time\n\nYeah totaL mad bs", "I wouldnt offer a full refund.  Dude could send back a totally fucked up gpu and op would have offered a refund.  Nah too risky", "Yes, he would. By taking off the heat sink that would have the thermal paste between it and the cpu/gpu. Taking the heat sink off to inspect the thermal paste = redoing the thermal paste. For pretty much any chip you'd use a heat sink on.\n\nThermal paste is just a highly heat conductive material used to ensure a good thermal contact between a chip and heat sink (or other cooling hardware that requires direct contact). If you remove the heat sink, even if just to inspect the paste, you really should just replace the paste. It's not going to reseat right after its been on there a while, and its only a few dollars (as others have mentioned).\n\nPlus, most video cards come with all of their cooling setup, including any heatsink that uses thermal paste (and the paste), pre-installed at the factory,. People can modify that cooling setup, but unless you're a heavy system customizer, why bother. Sure, thermal paste can go bad, but its a lot more likely to be an issue when done by average joe at home than by the factory.\n\nAs to how to determine that the paste might need replacing? By monitoring the temperature readings off the video card while using the computer. The same temps that OP said have always been good.\n\nThis really is an \"if it ain't broke, don't fix it\" scenario. And why multiple people are saying the buyer sounds like a scammer.\n\nOP is NTA.", "When they threaten you with a bad review if you don't give them what they want, that's feedback extortion and eBay will side with you.", "NTA. The person who bought it wouldn't see the thermal paste unless they were taking the card apart anyway. If the card is \"sold as is,\" any repairs they have to do after messing with the card is on them.", "NTA, of course he would have to replace the thermal paste? That's not your responsibility at all. You provided the graphics card.

I used my 1050 Ti for almost 8 years, and then moved it on to a friend who's still using it another \\~3 years later. Never touched the thermal paste, and it never had any heat issues.", "I've got a 960 in a computer I built in 2015, used for gaming until 2019 and now it runs my Plex server. I've never touched the thermal paste and it has never had a single heat issue. And thermal paste is also crazy cheap, I'd just ignore the buyer.", "Good point, I was mostly just being sarcastic. I don\u2019t actually think the scammer would go that far, but it could happen", "Changing thermal paste is one of the first things recommended a card starts running warm. Could be someone not knowing what he was doing, following internet instructions when the actual issue his new card is too big for his case and blocking airflow. \n\n\nI may have been that idiot once.

Used items are always sold \"as is\". Thermal paste is considered to be a consumable.

Go ahead and report them to eBay IMO.", "Lol you should always replace thermal compound when installing a part that needs it.

Report him to eBay. What he\u2019s doing is against the rules.", "Factory thermal paste is usually the stabilized kind too. Aftermarket and high performance blends have more volatile stuff that can degrade, but even that usually takes more than two years. This thing didn't need jack done to it except maybe a dust removal. That buyer is absolutely just fishing for a sucker.", "Yeah, I was thinking there must be some sort of mechanism to protect yourself against blackmail on eBay.", "I sold a MacBook on EBay and they said they never got it and left a shit review. As the seller I thought I was fucked but as long as I could prove that it shipped and fedex said it was delivered I was fine. \n\nIdk if the buyer was a scammer or if the laptop got stolen but most credit cards will reimburse for that.", "great advice, thank you.", "Did you use it to power a time machine? The 1050Ti released at the end of 2016, so even now it's only approaching 7 years old.", "I had a PC get thermal issues from bad paste once, but it was the pre-applied paste on a CPU that was $100 brand new, and the stuff still lasted four years. I also bullied the crap out of it daily in a reduced volume case with dirt cheap fans that I never cleaned, so that stuff was getting burned up day in and day out.", "I do a complete strip down and clean of my PC once a year, fresh thermal paste and all.\n\nAfter all you'd take your car for a yearly service, why not do the same for your computer?", "I don't remember upgrading that computer, but I must have added a new video card then. Now I'll have to go digging for my Newegg order from \\~2012 and see what the original video card was.", "Because thermal paste is way more stable than that, and the risk of introducing dust will usually cause trouble faster than the thermal paste degrading. Unless you're also servicing a liquid loop at the same time and thus have a good reason to pull the block off, there's no reason to fix what ain't broke. Replace it if you notice thermal throttling and otherwise, it's best to leave well enough alone.\n\nAlso, contact pressure is huge for conductivity, and wearing out the bracket will hurt your thermals worse than any paste upgrade could ever hope to fix.", "You service moving parts on your car. You don't pull apart the engine and replace gaskets because they might fail.", "I've been doing this for over 20 years and never had a part fail because of changing the paste. I prefer the better safe than sorry method.\n\nTo me stopping a problem before it becomes an issue is better than waiting until you see one.", "You do if the vehicles is in constant use and having it break, which often causes more damage, would be more expensive in the long run.\n\nQuite surprised how many people are against preventative maintenance given how much parts can often cost.", "No, you don't. Mine sites with vehicles running tens of thousands of hours don't replace non moving parts as a matter of course. What they do is look at fault history and predicted failure rates, because unnecessary work is more likely to introduce points of failure than prevent it.", "NTA.
