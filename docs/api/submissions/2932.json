Our shower curtains are see through so he could see my whole body whilst peeing which I felt gross about but I didn\u2019t think my brother had malicious intent. \n\nThe next morning, our lock got fixed so I could shower in peace again. I planned on having a shower that evening until I realised that the lock was faulty again (the whole bolt was missing again), I assumed it was more broken than we thought. I told my mother and she said she will tell our fixer to do it again.\n\nI had a shower again that evening and conveniently my brother needed to urinate three times in the 45 minute shower I took. I told him to go to the one downstairs but he said it was \u201coccupied\u201d everytime. Even though the only another person that was home was my mother and she was speaking on the phone in the kitchen. I thought this was suspicious again but I just threw it at the back of my mind. \n\nThe next day the lock was fixed and I finally could shower in peace and I did. My brother, that morning took my hair lotion because his ran out. So I went into his room to get my hair lotion and looked in his cabinets, when I found two pair of broken bolts that are exactly identical to the bathroom bolts that were gone.\n\nI felt frightened and sickened and i didn\u2019t know what to do other than call the police (my mother was at work). The police came and my brother was confused. I told them why I was scared and they detained him.

She might\u2019ve taken you more seriously if you hadn\u2019t caused such a commotion. \n\nas it is, I think her reaction was a little cavalier, but maybe you are a drama queen.
