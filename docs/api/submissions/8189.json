And I can't blame a struggling single mother for trying something drastic.", "Info: what kind of reform school. Honestly a lot of them are hot beds of abuse? Has her specific school been closed down for abusing students, or other scandals? It is kind of important information. Because you are horrible and I am glad you were sent away is one thing, but depending on where she was sent it could have an undertone of glad you were abused you deserved, which is another thing.", "NTA as someone who had a similar experience, my sister going to a residential school was the best thing that ever happened to me, because I was free from my tormenter and finally had a chance to heal", "NTA. You probably shouldn\u2019t have said that, but your sister needed to hear it if she really thought she was fine before she was sent away. Next time maybe be more gentle\u2026", "NTA - your mom did everything she could and while a \"reform school\" might not have been a good thing, she had you to think about as well.  Your sister was old enough at the time that she has to take some level of accountability for the behavior that forced your mother's hand on this.  Frankly, some family counseling for all of you might be a good thing, but based on your comment that sister refused to cooperate with counseling previously, I'm not sure it would do any good now.  Maybe for you and your mom to help you come to terms with the past.", "NTA.  Your sister may or may not have a valid grudge over reform school.  That being said, why does she get to talk about her bad treatment, but you don't?

Has your sister ever talked to you about what she experienced there?

She came back a different person tells me she was definitely abused (they use mental and emotional abuse as standard for \u201cfixing kids\u201d But they also are known to have people who sexually abuse kids, they use torture techniques (isolation, depriving of food and privacy)\u2026.", "NTA.

That doesn\u2019t mean she wasn\u2019t an absolute horror, but it\u2019s likely she was acting out because she was in pain and grieving.

Soft YTA. \n\nIt's difficult for you to see your older sister as a vulnerable child. But during her years of bad behavior that's exactly what she was. Your comment was needlessly harsh. \n\nSometimes it's important to let the past go and focus on ways to keep a strong relationship going now.", "NTA it\u2019s a valid feeling to be free of a bully regardless of relation.

YTA for saying that to her now and inappropriately for no reason. Your sister is allowed to feel her feelings towards your mom & you don\u2019t need to butt into that.\n\nYour sister sounds like she was dealing with a LOT of grief & handled it differently than you & your mom. Instead of offering support, love, and care - she got sent away? You have no idea what happened to her there or what they did to \u201cmake her completely different\u201d.

Did she need to hear it ...?  \nMy mom spent time in a reform school because she was a terror, defiant, using drugs, in general a nightmare and would not listen. It helped her in the end and after the school was shut down her and her mom talked about it- it was a therapists LAST resort for her when she wasn't working in therapy, taking meds or listening to anyone.

Why speak up at all? Your sister was talking to your mom and you decided to pipe up with a mean comment for no reason.", "ESH. You suck for what you said. Your mom sucks for sending away her grieving daughter. Your sister might suck depending on how she was acting, but again, she was a grieving child. Everyone experiences grief differently.", "I'm honestly torn between E S H and N A H because it was awful for everyone involved. Those schools have zero overhead or real regulation and are pretty much just abuse factories and far too often have mass graves out back. But also she needed SOME FORM OF HELP that your family wasn't able to provide, and they did what they (hopefully) thought would be in her best interest. This is a big no win situation for everyone.", "ESH, but you\u2019re way less of an A-hole in the grand scheme of things. She only went away for one or two months during the summer based on your other comments\u2026you should edit to add this. People are assuming you mean she went to a full on boarding school for 4 years and never saw her family during that whole time. Summer reform school, esp. a decent, behavioral-therapy based one? Not even CLOSE to the same thing and unless your sis was abused there, frankly she\u2019s being rather dramatic.\n\nShe became abusive, and whether or not it stemmed from grief she was old enough to know this was utterly wrong. Instead she persisted for years. She physically harmed and threatened you both. She came back from reform school changed, ostensibly for the better. So it actually worked and helped her to moderate her behavior! It seems like the issue isn\u2019t the school itself but the feeling that she was abandoned. \n\nYou really need to write out exactly how she made you feel during those bad years, how terrified you were, and how utterly helpless your mom felt because of her behavior (and all of this when you and your mom were grieving, too). So when she was sent away, it wasn\u2019t abandonment, but rather a last resort for an out of control situation that she needs to own up to!", "YTA", "NTA.", "I need to put in my 2 cents here...\nYes, there are some horrible \"reform \" schools out there which deserve all the bad press that they get.  HOWEVER there are some excellent residential schools out there.  Those schools can make a huge difference in lives of the students who are lucky enough to attend such a school.", "Judging from some of the comments made by OP, her sister was likely abused. The mom may have done what she thought was right but she didn\u2019t do her due diligence to check the reform school was a good environment. Her daughter was sent to one where she was likely abused. So she may have done what she felt was right but she also needs to recognize that she sent her daughter to abusers.\n\nEdit: I misread that the school was closed\n\nEdit2: I do understand OP being happy her bully was gone but that doesn\u2019t mean the sister isn\u2019t allowed to feel abandoned and rejected. If there was abuse happening at the reform school she is also allowed to be angry that she was put in that situation. I think the sister should be allowed to speak about it openly with her mother without OP present. Neither probably wants to hear what the other says but they need to have this conversation in private without the opinions of others.", "The release I felt the day my sibling left the house is something I never forgot.

Regardless of other factors. People that think like this are the reason. Why society is so aggressive today about abuse and why you can't blame people for it.

OP was young and had no one to advocate for her except their mother.\n\nThe mother is responsible for sending the daughter to the facility, but the motive can be understood. Her daughter was actively abusing her younger daughter, OP says that Mom took on debt to get the sister help, and sister didn't respond to anything. It was an end case scenario.\n\nThis scenario is also on real life television. Adult parents with grown up children who bully them. The parents tried to get help, but eventually gave into the child. The sibling sacrificed for and told to deal with it has issues because of it.\n\nIt's common for the sibling to post on reddit. My parents raised my sibling and let them do whatever they want. I want to be treated like a human being instead of being raised to give into the sibling.\n\nLife isn't always black and white. It's various shades of grey.

I am the child of an abusive drunk, and I have indeed had trauma in my life, so I never think that people who are abused are responsible for what was done to them.\n\nI never said she was resonsible for being abused.  Based on OP's information, sister was hell on wheels and steroids after father's death--which is understandable--but flat refused any professional help and continued to make everyone else's life hell for them, yet claims she was \"fine\" so her mother was in the wrong for what she did. I said \"she has to take some level of accountability for the behavior that forced your mother's hand\"", "...you okay?", "OP did not specify being tormented or bullied.

However the wording definitely sounds like she was abused. Most \u201creform\u201d schools can be abusive in nature and they often do not comply with state guidelines. Some leave with PTSD and there have been hundreds of lawsuits against reform schools over the years. In Missouri here was actually 30 lawsuits against only 2 boarding schools for abuse in 2022. I have a friend who worked for a school for kids with behavioral issues (it was an overnight facility that was associated with the school district). It is considered a mental health facility and they were heavily trained, monitored and had cameras in every room but bathrooms so the staff wouldn\u2019t be able to abuse the children. Most reform schools don\u2019t have those guidelines because they are now considered boarding schools so cameras aren\u2019t allowed in several areas. If it really is still being called a reform school that may be a red flag. Most rebranded after the fallout with abusive reform schools in the last few decades.", "I thought she said it was closed down mb.

Her sister was abused (or had bad memories) from the school. Point is, they were both abused so why should op feel sympathy for her sister when she was her abuser. I wouldn't wish bad on my sibling if I was in that situation but I would definitely be glad to be out of it myself.", "Are you blind to the hypocrisy of your comment?", "Like making a assumption that the mother did everything?", "The mother is automatically in the wrong for sending her to an abusive facility.

I have cried listening to them.\nHow any religion can see abusing and killing innocent children ripped from their parents is ok on any level is beyond evil. Very sick people. Now I think I know what my Mom was talking about.", "In another comment OP said that her sister went away to the school for one summer. I believe her statement of 11-16 is about the duration of her sister\u2019s bad behavior prior to the summer reform school.", "People don\u2019t need to have sympathy or compassion for someone who chose to cause them harm.", "Except that\u2019s not the kind of school she went to. OP\u2019s comments state it was only for the summer. She was back for high school in the fall.  She was there for a month, then got weekend visits after that.", "I\u2019ve never heard Eton referred to as a residential school. Eton doesn\u2019t refer to itself as a residential school.", "College in UK is like jr & sr years in highschool in US or like a community college in US? And university in UK is college in the US?", "What is your data which backs up your belief in the quality of pediatric mental health care facilities in (I presume, the United States?)", "If her friends left her after just one summer of being apart, there likely were some major cracks in their relationships before she left.", "I think that does add valuable context, she wasn\u2019t sent away for an extremely long time at least. I understand her abandonment issues because of that, but your mother has to protect you too- even if it meant sending your sister away, who clearly needed help. You said she\u2019s a changed person, was it a change for the better? What you said was harsh and could have been phrased differently but I don\u2019t think you\u2019re the asshole here. She made a really hard time in your life even more difficult by bullying you, and you\u2019re right to call her on it imo if she\u2019s going to try to erase history and act like everything was fine and she was sent off for no reason", "I\u2019m not saying sister went away for that many years. I took it as OP saying that was the years of chaos she felt and experienced from her sister.", "YTA - not because I think you need to forgive your sister, you don\u2019t. \n\nIt\u2019s because you didn\u2019t need to say anything at all. 1) You inserted yourself into this argument. It was argument between her and your mom. She was expressing her feelings about a (most likely) traumatic experience that your mom was responsible for. 2) It was unnecessarily hurtful. Imagine If someone you knew said that their favorite memory was one of your worst\u2026 all you did was escalate the situation. (Not helpful to anyone - especially your mom). \n\nYes, your sister needs to take accountability for the hurt/harm she caused you. But it seems like lack of accountability / empathy is a problem with your family. Just like your sister refuses to acknowledge how her behavior negatively impacted you, your mom is doing that to her. (Yes I realize she was she was out of options, but your mom chose a bad/unsafe environment for your sister). How would you feel if you confronted your sister about her hurtful behavior and she simply said \u201cyou\u2019re fine\u201d. It would at least frustrating, if not hurtful and enraging. Which is what was happening when you butted into this emotionally charged conversation. \n\nIf your sister was arguing with you and/or asked for your opinion about her past behavior, then my judgement would be different. \n\nI can\u2019t tell what you want from your relationship sister. But you did say your house was great when it was peaceful. I doubt your sister is going to stop bringing up this issue, and if you keep escalating the situation your home will cease to be peaceful. \n\nInstead try validating her experience. When she says \u201cyour a crap mom for sending me away\u201d, you could say \u201cI can see how you feel that way\u2026\u201d.", "I couldn't find anywhere OP wrote she was abused by the school, only that her \"bad memories\" are of her family \"throwing her away\", i.e. = sent to a reform school for her abusive behaviour. \n\nSounds like she needs therapy and some more time to grow into her self. Perhaps she was acting out at her father's death and being thrown into a lower class financially.", "The catholic church is too busy paying off victims of sexual abuse.", "Yes. In Canada too. We don\u2019t call private schools residential schools. They\u2019re boarding schools.", "There were Indian boarding schools in the US too. With those I talk to and in many journals they are not referred to as residential schools. Such as that is, OPs experience may have been good or bad, not sure.", "So people using the same words which have vastly different meanings to each of them. \n\nAny kids, but especially when indigenous kids are specifically targeted and sent away to places where they can be abused with little or most likely zero consequences for the perpetrators, are abhorrent.\n\nThanks for making the differences clear without attacking the poster.", "Depends on where you are. We call them boarding schools on the rez I\u2019m from.", "College is when your 16/17/18 (your \u2018last two years\u2019) and you take three or four courses to get the qualifications to get into uni, also called sixth form. Then uni is like your college (except i think some of our courses are different? You can go straight to studying medicine or law here).\n\nHowever, Eton College is from 13-18, and i think its called that because its an old name and \u2018secondary school\u2019 (11-16/18) no longer fits.", "No sure, I am Canadian. Not American. Our college here is like trade school, and University is more US college.", "personally, even if my tormentors eventually did acknowledge the abuse, it wouldn't mean anything to me after years of them denying it", "Idk why you're being down voted, there's good advice and it's a very complex situation. It's Reddit, I suppose.", "That abuse matters too. But it doesn't change my point. Just because the mom had good intentions does not mean her actions were not abusive. Many parents who hit there children do it because they think it helped. These reform school's don't help eather. \nSo yeah, sistwe abused brother, mom abused sisternwhen trying to protect op. I see a dysfunctional family that op should just go NC with. Mom obviously doenst know what she is doing if she had to hurt one kid to protect the other. Brother seems like he hates his sister and honestly should just go NC with her instead of arguing about the past.", "Or putting more energy into fighting victims in court hoping they die before the settlements happen. \n\nJust made a comment outlining an example 2 comments down.", "Ah Thanks for the explanation!", "Not sure the level of abuse, so I\u2019ll agree with you depending on context. 11-16 year old again who lost her father... not taking away from anyone\u2019s pain or suffering. They all lost a loved one.", "I mean I get it. If the sister was writing, I'd say something very different. The reality is they were both two kids/teenagers who went through some shit they shouldn't have had to go through. Right now they're both tugging mightily on their end of the rope. If OP can figure out how to drop her end, they stand to have a lot more in common than not.", "You're arguing hypotheticals. There is nothing in the post or comments that the sister was abused at the reform school so unless new information comes to light it has no relevance. Sending a kid to a reform school it isn't automatically abuse (the caveat here is that a parent is absolutely being abusive if they don't do their due diligence and research the place). There are some amazing places that focus on mental health and helping the kids and there are some places that should be shut down and prosecuted. There are also places that are medium that don't solve the problem but also help behavior enough to keep the kid from going to jail. Based on the post and comments it sounds like this was more of a medium place.", "The USA will never know how many bodies it has. \n\nMy Uncle is somewhere between Ogden Utah and Shiprock, NM. He tripped and hit his head on a rock when he and his brother were running away. His brother buried him and eventually made it home. Only to be caught 3 days later and taken back.", "PEI here, they just sweep everything under the rug. It\u2019s fucking bullshit.", "I am really glad that everything worked out well for you and your family. It's hard when our children struggle. \n\nI understand that it does not state anywhere that she was physical but it is also not stated thar she wasn't. Neither of us really knows what went on. I was really just curious to know what you did or would have done if your child was physically hurting your other kids. \n\nI also am curious what would you have done if your kid didn't participate in therapy or continued to be oppositional despite all of the work, structure, understanding, and classes. It's great that you had access to those resources and that they helped. Unfortunately not everyone has access or maybe even the means for those things. \n\nI guess I'm just trying to completely understand your point of view. I do want to say that I appreciate that you have taken the time to respond to me.", "Not to mention the medical experiments", "I found 408 but they\u2019re not listing 2 or 3 I know my dad or siblings were in.

You're coming in here confidently going \"I have no idea about any other way to handle this, but my complete ignorance in no way means my opinion is useless.\"\n\nBut, your complete ignorance about how to handle the situation really does make your opinion worthless."]}
