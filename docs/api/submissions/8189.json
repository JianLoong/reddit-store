Has her specific school been closed down for abusing students, or other scandals? It is kind of important information.

Those schools have zero overhead or real regulation and are pretty much just abuse factories and far too often have mass graves out back.

She only went away for one or two months during the summer based on your other comments\u2026you should edit to add this.

Not even CLOSE to the same thing and unless your sis was abused there, frankly she\u2019s being rather dramatic.\n\nShe became abusive, and whether or not it stemmed from grief she was old enough to know this was utterly wrong. Instead she persisted for years. She physically harmed and threatened you both. She came back from reform school changed, ostensibly for the better. So it actually worked and helped her to moderate her behavior! It seems like the issue isn\u2019t the school itself but the feeling that she was abandoned. \n\nYou really need to write out exactly how she made you feel during those bad years, how terrified you were, and how utterly helpless your mom felt because of her behavior (and all of this when you and your mom were grieving, too).

The mom may have done what she thought was right but she didn\u2019t do her due diligence to check the reform school was a good environment. Her daughter was sent to one where she was likely abused. So she may have done what she felt was right but she also needs to recognize that she sent her daughter to abusers.\n\nEdit: I misread that the school was closed\n\nEdit2: I do understand OP being happy her bully was gone but that doesn\u2019t mean the sister isn\u2019t allowed to feel abandoned and rejected. If there was abuse happening at the reform school she is also allowed to be angry that she was put in that situation. I think the sister should be allowed to speak about it openly with her mother without OP present.

Her daughter was actively abusing her younger daughter, OP says that Mom took on debt to get the sister help, and sister didn't respond to anything. It was an end case scenario.\n\nThis scenario is also on real life television. Adult parents with grown up children who bully them. The parents tried to get help, but eventually gave into the child. The sibling sacrificed for and told to deal with it has issues because of it.\n\nIt's common for the sibling to post on reddit. My parents raised my sibling and let them do whatever they want. I want to be treated like a human being instead of being raised to give into the sibling.\n\nLife isn't always black and white. It's various shades of grey.

I have a friend who worked for a school for kids with behavioral issues (it was an overnight facility that was associated with the school district). It is considered a mental health facility and they were heavily trained, monitored and had cameras in every room but bathrooms so the staff wouldn\u2019t be able to abuse the children. Most reform schools don\u2019t have those guidelines because they are now considered boarding schools so cameras aren\u2019t allowed in several areas.

And gaslighting on top of it--\"go ahead and call DYPHS, here's the phone.

I stayed out of sight in my room because if she didn't notice me, there wouldn't be an excuse to hit me.\n\nBut it was different for my middle sister. She acted out. We were both suffering, but she was horrible to me, too. Sometimes it was covert, like going into my room and stealing things. Other times it was overt like starting fights. She ended up getting into drugs and doing pretty typical rebellious behaviors. \n\nI never connected her behavior to the abuse we experienced until I shared my story with a friend, who commented that acting out like that is common from child abuse. That conversation was what finally made it click that we were abused. \n\nIn my case, my sister and I get along now. I've cut out the abuser, but she hasn't.

Maybe she was also treated poorly by your mother; perhaps you weren't, and she resented that? She might not even consciously know that's the case yet.

It's possible that her feelings of abandonment started from before the summer program, and that was just the final, \"see? You did abandon me!\"\n\nMaybe I'm off base. Maybe she was just a monster and is looking for an excuse. It happens.

Was it a camp? Was it labeled for 'troubled teens'? Your mother WAS a crap mom for sending her away. Yta obviously. That day was probably the day when your sister realized your mother had finally given up on her, and you told her it was the best day of your life. Sad.\n\nEdit just saw the therapy comment. Did you try individual and family? Relatives? Group counseling?", "To get back to the topic, YNTA. However, you could have been more diplomatic. That said, you definitely needed to speak up on your, and your mom\u2019s, behalf.

OP, your sister needed to know how her actions affected you and your mom", "NAH I hope you were both able to get therapy/counselling after your dad passed. That would have been so hard especially with your whole life being uprooted. Puberty is such a hard stage of life even for teens with a very stable and supportive household. I think she was probably struggling at the time which caused her to act out. At that age we don't really understand how hard it is for our parent/s. But that also doesn't negate the fact that it probably was the best day of your life when she left for school. Siblings don't really hold back with the truth so I don't think you were necessarily an AH but it wasn't really nice either. \n\nI was around 13 when my parents got a divorce and I also made my mum's life hard up until I was around 19. There were also other issues going on and I never got therapy or counselling unfortunately. I ended up being a very angry teen. Now I'm 29 and have 2 kids of my own I would be so sad if they treated me the way I treated my mum! But I think I would also have a better understanding based on my own experience! Hopefully anyway. We all just try to do our best in life.", "NTA. The truth hurts but the truth is the truth.", "NTA, hopefully as she matures, she'll also see it was the best thing for her at time as well. My heart goes out to all of you, what a tremendous loss at such a young age. Sounds like you're all dealing with it the best you can and may you all continue to heal, grow, and gain strength.\n\nEdit: reading comments. I'm sorry she had additional struggles there as well. It sounds like your mom did her best to protect you and herself and thinking at the time it was best alternative for your sister. Again, I hope the future brings healing to all of you and you can have a healthy relationship later on. It sounds like everything is still fresh- and trust me, it does take years to mend yourself and fractured familial relations from a toxic youth.", "Not comfortable making a judgement on this one. This is a really horrible situation for all of you. Your mother tried to do what was best for your family and tried to consider both of you, but she *did* send your sister to a *reform school,* which are notoriously abusive, so I sympathize with your sister lashing out at your mother for sending her to one. You're a teenager who was tired of getting bullied by your sister and lashed out. I don't think anyone here can be labeled as a concrete asshole, it's a horrible, horrible situation and I'm sorry for all of you.", "NTA. My sister had a hellion for a child because her and baby daddy spoiled her literally rotten. She decided she wanted to live with Daddy dearest. So the judge switched custody. 2 years later, maybe not even quite 2 years, she was put into a specialized foster home that was super strict. At 36 I would have told that child the same thing. It was better she go there because neither parent handled her well at all. The part that made me almost laugh is that her father was a cop, knew better than to spoil her like that, and still had my niece taken away and sent into foster care. I have been told that this kind of foster care is very closely monitored by the courts so I have no idea if abuse is possible or not. But it turned my niece into a completely well behaved person who quit stealing, drinking and drugs and stayed sober for about 2 years.

Everyone\u2019s different so everyone interacts differently. You might have been easier to deal with where she wasn\u2019t during a difficult time of your moms life so you didn\u2019t get the same version as she personally did, so some of her feelings may be valid that some personal needs might not have been met (I\u2019m assuming) and because she was difficult your moms threshold for her nonsense might not have been all there and she really might not have been as patient with her as she was with you.

There is a huge mix of wording across countries that refer to very different things, and terms have changed over time. Ugh not just native/Indian/ indigenous schools (boarding/residential) in the US, but forced sterilization on young women and such in those \"schools\".", "Eton College is called Eton College because that's what King Henry the Sixth decided to call it when he founded it in 1440.", "\u201cAnd I was 8 when she started to make my life hell, it sucked but it doesn\u2019t excuse the Years or torment she put me through..\u201d\n\nOP never said the extent of the torment, doesn\u2019t have too... therapist might help her sort through those feelings. She doesn\u2019t need to forgive, but being able to talk to someone about it vs public opinion might me a healthy option.", "Bro they said this started when the sister was ELEVEN. You're blaming a preteen for \"not getting the help they need?\" And where was \"bullying\" ever mentioned? Sounds like projection.", "The mother went into debt trying to get the sister the help she needed. Sister refused to engage. OP mentions the bullying she experienced at her sister's hands at the age of 8 several times. She also discussed the torment of the mother, the unsafe environment. Saying what happened isn't projection.", "I'm so sorry. People like to think what your family experienced is so far into the past that no one who experienced it is alive to talk about it, or it happened to their great great relatives so we can pretend its no longer relevant for our own comfort. \n\nThank you for sharing your families history.", "The fact that Canada and the US have such a small percentage of Indigenous population is heartbreaking and honestly surprising. In Alberta I've seen and met so many Indigenous people I never would have imagined the numbers were so small.", "Public schools are private schools in the England. \n\nPublic\u2019s schools are called State schools in England.\n\nEdit: changed from UK to England.", "So, public schools are private/independent, but not all private/independent schools are public. Kind of like a \"all thumbs are fingers but not all fingers are thumbs\" situation.\nTo be a public school, then the headteacher of a private school must be a member of the HMC, the Headmasters and Headmistresses Conference. This group represents something like the top 300 private schools in the UK. So there are a lot of private schools that aren't members - anyone can decide they're going to set up a school and charge to attend it - but being part of the HMC is a mark of the calibre of the school and the education it offers.", "Eton is also a public school and a boarding school. There can be \u2018day pupils\u2019 who go home at the end of the day and \u2018boarders\u2019. Day pupils aren\u2019t very common.", "I thiiiink it's historical as in the first public schools were open to commoners and not just the nobility. So they were public for the time they were created even though the name just looks daft now.", "It's a weird English thing. In most countries I know of publicly funded (i.e. state) schools are called public schools. Privately funded schools are called private or independent schools.", "UK state schools absolutely are open to every UK resident, unless they have entered the country for example on a tourist visa and then just stayed. But the onus is on the parent to check they are eligible - schools cannot ask to check anyone's visa or immigration status or refuse them a place on that basis. \nPublic schools being called public has got nothing to do with who they're open to - most of them are highly academically selective and expensive. Public schools are private/independent, but not all private/independent schools are public. To be a public school, then the headteacher of a private school must be a member of the HMC, the Headmasters and Headmistresses Conference.

I've recently been hearing it more and more from the US, so we'll see if it catches on", "I'm not from the US, but read a very interesting conversation on reddit the other day where a few people were saying that many indigenous people from the USA actually don't like the term Native or Native American, and prefer to be called Indians. I wish I could find the thread now because I found it fascinating, but I think a part of the reasoning was that all of those terms had been imposed on them by outsiders, so one was as good as another if you aren't going to refer to the correct tribal name, and some people just don't like being called \"Native\" because it was a word often used interchangeably with \"Savage\" in colonial times.\n\nSo it really does depend on who you ask.", "It's not closed down, it was 1 summer. She was back at school when the summer was over", "You miss spelt England. A public school in Scotland is local authority, private schools are businesses. Not sure about Wales or NI", "I think a public school has to spend all its fees on the school. If there's an excess, then it's returned back to the parents. Independent schools keep the profit. I might be mistaken though."]}
