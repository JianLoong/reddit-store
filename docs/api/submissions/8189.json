And I can't blame a struggling single mother for trying something drastic.", "Info: what kind of reform school. Honestly a lot of them are hot beds of abuse? Has her specific school been closed down for abusing students, or other scandals? It is kind of important information. Because you are horrible and I am glad you were sent away is one thing, but depending on where she was sent it could have an undertone of glad you were abused you deserved, which is another thing.", "NTA as someone who had a similar experience, my sister going to a residential school was the best thing that ever happened to me, because I was free from my tormenter and finally had a chance to heal", "NTA. You probably shouldn\u2019t have said that, but your sister needed to hear it if she really thought she was fine before she was sent away. Next time maybe be more gentle\u2026", "NTA - your mom did everything she could and while a \"reform school\" might not have been a good thing, she had you to think about as well.  Your sister was old enough at the time that she has to take some level of accountability for the behavior that forced your mother's hand on this.  Frankly, some family counseling for all of you might be a good thing, but based on your comment that sister refused to cooperate with counseling previously, I'm not sure it would do any good now.  Maybe for you and your mom to help you come to terms with the past.", "NTA.  Your sister may or may not have a valid grudge over reform school.  That being said, why does she get to talk about her bad treatment, but you don't?

Has your sister ever talked to you about what she experienced there?

She came back a different person tells me she was definitely abused (they use mental and emotional abuse as standard for \u201cfixing kids\u201d But they also are known to have people who sexually abuse kids, they use torture techniques (isolation, depriving of food and privacy)\u2026.", "NTA.

That doesn\u2019t mean she wasn\u2019t an absolute horror, but it\u2019s likely she was acting out because she was in pain and grieving.

Soft YTA. \n\nIt's difficult for you to see your older sister as a vulnerable child. But during her years of bad behavior that's exactly what she was. Your comment was needlessly harsh. \n\nSometimes it's important to let the past go and focus on ways to keep a strong relationship going now.", "NTA it\u2019s a valid feeling to be free of a bully regardless of relation.

YTA for saying that to her now and inappropriately for no reason. Your sister is allowed to feel her feelings towards your mom & you don\u2019t need to butt into that.\n\nYour sister sounds like she was dealing with a LOT of grief & handled it differently than you & your mom. Instead of offering support, love, and care - she got sent away? You have no idea what happened to her there or what they did to \u201cmake her completely different\u201d.

Did she need to hear it ...?  \nMy mom spent time in a reform school because she was a terror, defiant, using drugs, in general a nightmare and would not listen. It helped her in the end and after the school was shut down her and her mom talked about it- it was a therapists LAST resort for her when she wasn't working in therapy, taking meds or listening to anyone.

Why speak up at all? Your sister was talking to your mom and you decided to pipe up with a mean comment for no reason.", "ESH. You suck for what you said. Your mom sucks for sending away her grieving daughter. Your sister might suck depending on how she was acting, but again, she was a grieving child. Everyone experiences grief differently.", "I'm honestly torn between E S H and N A H because it was awful for everyone involved. Those schools have zero overhead or real regulation and are pretty much just abuse factories and far too often have mass graves out back. But also she needed SOME FORM OF HELP that your family wasn't able to provide, and they did what they (hopefully) thought would be in her best interest. This is a big no win situation for everyone.", "ESH, but you\u2019re way less of an A-hole in the grand scheme of things. She only went away for one or two months during the summer based on your other comments\u2026you should edit to add this. People are assuming you mean she went to a full on boarding school for 4 years and never saw her family during that whole time. Summer reform school, esp. a decent, behavioral-therapy based one? Not even CLOSE to the same thing and unless your sis was abused there, frankly she\u2019s being rather dramatic.\n\nShe became abusive, and whether or not it stemmed from grief she was old enough to know this was utterly wrong. Instead she persisted for years. She physically harmed and threatened you both. She came back from reform school changed, ostensibly for the better. So it actually worked and helped her to moderate her behavior! It seems like the issue isn\u2019t the school itself but the feeling that she was abandoned. \n\nYou really need to write out exactly how she made you feel during those bad years, how terrified you were, and how utterly helpless your mom felt because of her behavior (and all of this when you and your mom were grieving, too). So when she was sent away, it wasn\u2019t abandonment, but rather a last resort for an out of control situation that she needs to own up to!", "YTA", "NTA.", "I need to put in my 2 cents here...\nYes, there are some horrible \"reform \" schools out there which deserve all the bad press that they get.  HOWEVER there are some excellent residential schools out there.  Those schools can make a huge difference in lives of the students who are lucky enough to attend such a school.", "Judging from some of the comments made by OP, her sister was likely abused. The mom may have done what she thought was right but she didn\u2019t do her due diligence to check the reform school was a good environment. Her daughter was sent to one where she was likely abused. So she may have done what she felt was right but she also needs to recognize that she sent her daughter to abusers.\n\nEdit: I misread that the school was closed\n\nEdit2: I do understand OP being happy her bully was gone but that doesn\u2019t mean the sister isn\u2019t allowed to feel abandoned and rejected. If there was abuse happening at the reform school she is also allowed to be angry that she was put in that situation. I think the sister should be allowed to speak about it openly with her mother without OP present. Neither probably wants to hear what the other says but they need to have this conversation in private without the opinions of others.", "The release I felt the day my sibling left the house is something I never forgot.

Regardless of other factors. People that think like this are the reason. Why society is so aggressive today about abuse and why you can't blame people for it.

OP was young and had no one to advocate for her except their mother.\n\nThe mother is responsible for sending the daughter to the facility, but the motive can be understood. Her daughter was actively abusing her younger daughter, OP says that Mom took on debt to get the sister help, and sister didn't respond to anything. It was an end case scenario.\n\nThis scenario is also on real life television. Adult parents with grown up children who bully them. The parents tried to get help, but eventually gave into the child. The sibling sacrificed for and told to deal with it has issues because of it.\n\nIt's common for the sibling to post on reddit. My parents raised my sibling and let them do whatever they want. I want to be treated like a human being instead of being raised to give into the sibling.\n\nLife isn't always black and white. It's various shades of grey.

I am the child of an abusive drunk, and I have indeed had trauma in my life, so I never think that people who are abused are responsible for what was done to them.\n\nI never said she was resonsible for being abused.  Based on OP's information, sister was hell on wheels and steroids after father's death--which is understandable--but flat refused any professional help and continued to make everyone else's life hell for them, yet claims she was \"fine\" so her mother was in the wrong for what she did. I said \"she has to take some level of accountability for the behavior that forced your mother's hand\"", "...you okay?", "OP did not specify being tormented or bullied.

However the wording definitely sounds like she was abused. Most \u201creform\u201d schools can be abusive in nature and they often do not comply with state guidelines. Some leave with PTSD and there have been hundreds of lawsuits against reform schools over the years. In Missouri here was actually 30 lawsuits against only 2 boarding schools for abuse in 2022. I have a friend who worked for a school for kids with behavioral issues (it was an overnight facility that was associated with the school district). It is considered a mental health facility and they were heavily trained, monitored and had cameras in every room but bathrooms so the staff wouldn\u2019t be able to abuse the children. Most reform schools don\u2019t have those guidelines because they are now considered boarding schools so cameras aren\u2019t allowed in several areas. If it really is still being called a reform school that may be a red flag. Most rebranded after the fallout with abusive reform schools in the last few decades.", "I thought she said it was closed down mb.

Her sister was abused (or had bad memories) from the school. Point is, they were both abused so why should op feel sympathy for her sister when she was her abuser. I wouldn't wish bad on my sibling if I was in that situation but I would definitely be glad to be out of it myself.", "Are you blind to the hypocrisy of your comment?", "Like making a assumption that the mother did everything?", "The mother is automatically in the wrong for sending her to an abusive facility. What your not getting here is that the abuse is what matters here. if she was abused the mother is wrong by default. If she wasn't then the mother was right. \nIt's that simple. If you take a measure to help your child as a parent, and the child is hurt by it, YOU are responsible for that, not the child. \nSo yeah, the mom's reasons don't matter I'd the girl was abused. And I assumed you have no trauma because people with trauma don't go around telling trauma survivors to take responsibility for something someone else did to them.", "Actually she did in later comments.\n\n\"She was awful, she tormented my mother and me for years, it wasn\u2019t her being difficult it was her throwing crap and making our lives a nightmare. I can\u2019t think of a single day that was peaceful back.\"\n\n\"She was my bully for years, it doesn\u2019t help that she never owned up to her bad behavior. She much better now but no close relationship.\"\n\nOp said mom even went into debt trying to get the sister help, and the sister either refused to go or refused to talk. The reform school was a last resort, and OP also said it was only a summer school, sister was back in the fall for school and she never said there was abuse.", ">OP did not specify being tormented or bullied. She said the behavior \"really sucked\".\n\nA difference without a distinction. You're just plain wrong and don't want to admit it, as is generally the case with semantic arguments.", "She was my bully for years, it doesn\u2019t help that she never owned up to her bad behavior. She much better now but no close relationship.", "Seems like you either don't have children or your children don't have serious behavioral issues. My sister works with kids who have behavioral issues and she's been punched, kicked, and bitten. It doesn'thappen all the time, but it does happen. Do you think if OP's older sister were physically harming OP that it would be fair for them to live in those conditions? \n\nI think the mom probably tried everything she possibly could and may have thought that the reform school would help her daughter. What would you do if there weren't any more options or things to try? What would you do to protect your other children? I don't think OP's mom threw thier daughter away. She probably couldn't think of anything else to try. It's so easy for others to judge a parent when they aren't in or have never been in the same situation. Maybe the mom regrets it now, who knows? Most of the time parents are just doing the best they can with the resources they have available.", "OP made a few comments that the mother went into debt to try and help the sister. During that time, she wouldn't engage in therapy, tormented her mother and bullied OP. It's not like the mom just decided to get rid of her on a whim. She did what she felt was best for the family at the time. Remember, the mother was also grieving.", "Have you read OP's other comments?", "Doesn\u2019t mean siblings can start to bully younger siblings.

My Canadian went to a rich people boarding school (coincidentally one also attended by British royalty) and it is very, very different than residential schools.", "OP didn't share that her sister was abused, so I don't think everyone can make that assumption. Is it a real possibility? Absolutely. But until OP shares that her sister relayed that, I don't like to assume.", "She might eventually acknowledge though. she\u2019s 22, you\u2019re 19. A therapist might help you out with these feelings", "Omfg get over it. At least you got to keep living with your mom.", "People don't do those kinds of things when they're mentally well. She was struggling like you and your mom, but in different ways.", "Then tell her that, instead of focusing on how terrible you think she is. My spouse's childhood was a lot like yours - older sibling who terrorized him, and that sibling was sent to a reform school where they were abused. I promise your sister went through some *shit* you don't know about - and is almost certainly struggling with feeling like she deserved it because she knows she was a hard kid, and then her mom sent her away. I'm not minimizing what you went through, too. Try taking a deep breath, saying something like \"I am so sorry for what happened to you - you don't deserve it. It was really hard for me when you were terrible to mom and I, and it would mean a lot if you apologized\" and then *listen*.\n\nMy spouse and his sibling are ride-or-die best friends today and I want that for you, too.", "And what about the abuse the sister did to OP? Should the mother just ignore that? Sister made OP's life hell.  That is abuse. Sister just forgets that she was verbally abusive to her family, which is why the mom sent her away.", "I can't believe how ignorant some of these people are to trauma.  The 12 steps were made for a reason and she hasn't even completed making amends.", "And now \\*you're\\* the bully.", "[deleted]", "actually, I have 4 children, and yes, one of them had a difficult time from about 14-18. my oldest. it was hard! frankly he was a bit of a shit, but I knew where that came from. (not going into his trauma on Reddit) I did everything I could think of to help and also keep a stable home. in the end, he is a wonderful man, a kind and thoughtful human, a wonderful father, and has a great career. I'm proud of him and wouldn't have done it any differently.  AND all my children know, always knew the are not expendable.", "yup.", "So if I have two kids and one bullies the other (as kids often do) I should just abandon the \"bad\" kid?", "Because I don't think problem children should be abandoned by their parents? Okay lmao", "The Canadian Government needs to kick the Catholic Church to the curb. AT LEAST take away their tax exempt status because as a religion they continue to do horrible shit.", "By that logic, OPs sis can omfg get over it, since she's still alive too. \ud83d\ude44", "Yes because she wasn't the abusive one.", "People can be mentally unwell, and still be abusive to others. From OP\u2019s other comments the sister was enrolled in therapy and refused to participate. \n\nI completely understand that being sent away was not the best way to handle it for the older child, but when a kid is throwing things, their parent/s can\u2019t just think about whats best for that one child; they have an obligation to consider what\u2019s best for both children. Removing her from being able to harm OP may have been the best option.", "I mean the 12 steps were designed for people with addictions and a lot of them are quite religious or very specific to addiction. It's not a 1 for 1 here.", "You taking about the trauma of being sent away and abandoned by your family right?", "You are disgusting", "Boo.", "Did he physically harm your other children? If so, how did you protect your other children?", "So, how would you have handled it? You're a grieving wife with two kids who are also suffering. You're now in debt trying to get help for your eldest who won't speak to any therapists. Your eldest also torments you and your other child regularly to the point where you don't know how to handle it. What would you have done? I am not being argumentative at all here; I am genuinely interested.", "What are your circumstances? Are you a widow? Is your child refusing to get the help they need because their father passed away? Are you working as much as you can to make ends meet? Are you tired all the time from being a single mother? Is your younger kid suffering from the bullying?", "Not to mention when OP\u2019s father passed away she was only 8 years old.", "No because you downplay the abuse of OP and OP's mum by OP's sisters hand as 'acting out'. She made OPs life a living hell and reduced the quality of life severely.\n\n\nIn the end their treatment of OP and OP mom could have ended in suicide or mental breakdown. Destroying the family even further.", "They did the same horrible shit everywhere. It's just Canada is the one in the headlines.

That kind of pain runs deep.", "Why? Maybe op sucks. Sure seems like it", "he was not physical with people, objects, yes, until we got the boundaries clear. it took therapy, personal and family, and many, many parenting classes  to achieve that. struggling children need structure, understanding and love, not punishment.  nowhere in OP's post does it say her sister physically harmed anyone. only that she was a terror, which could be very subjective.", "I would have continued parenting my troubled child even though it was difficult.", "I don't know how to explain to you that even difficult minors don't deserve to be abandoned by their parents and left to be abused, but it sounds like you've made up your mind anyways. Bummer to learn that I'm an enabler though! I sure hope my family doesn't completely cut contact with me lmao", "Canada is already in the tens of thousands, and has a 5% indigenous population.

YOU cannot fix them, and they are causing misery to others or creating a life time of pain for another it is time to call in experts. I also know my Mother was in a reform school for being the terror to her younger brother, mother and step father for 5 years. She spent three in the school (USA, Kentucky- the school was shut down for abuse.).   \nDid she feel tossed away, yes, did it help her... kinda, she learned how to better hide her pot, she learned to follow rules- for the most part- and she got her life under more control. You know what else, she threaten me with the same thing when I was getting close to her level of defiance. I am glad she threaten me with it! I needed the reality check, I instead spent a week in the psych ward.   \nSometimes you need more then your parents to save you from yourself, your brain, or your actions.   \nI don't know how old you are, but I hope if you have kids and they are a rage/depression/ suicide machine that walks a hard edge you know when to step back and let someone else take over.   \nAnd no honestly till someone does more work on reform schools and there are better regulations I don't think they are a perfect answer.... or psych wards.... \\*shiver\\*."]}
