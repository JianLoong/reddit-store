Your ex is TA for calling it child abuse. Your two-year-old knows nothing and your five-year-old doesn\u2019t really know that much.  To them, your boyfriend is just a guy that is around. I don\u2019t think they understand the significance of anything yet.", "NTA. Child abuse? Wtf?", "NTA. Your ex can\u2019t control who you date or how you spend your time with your kids, although many coparents try their damndest to.", "Nta. I say that because of my own story. So seven years ago my husband and I had just started dating, I was 21 with two young daughters, he was 30 with zero responsibilities. Anyways, my mom was my babysitter while I worked a full time minimum wage job, because I had to pay bills and buy food, I was already living alone and didn\u2019t have other options. Fast forward and my mom had my girls and some emergency came up, she brought my kids home, and dropped them with my boyfriend of oh maybe eight weeks. He\u2019s never met them, my mom had only said hello in passing, and he had never had kids to care for. Without hesitation he said he\u2019d stay with them until I got home. When I walked in from work he was wearing my 7 month old and my two year old was standing in a chair beside him cooking dinner. In that moment I immediately knew I\u2019d never look anywhere else again. Was it too early, I really had thought so, but let\u2019s be honest when are we ever right about timing. It\u2019s different for everyone, do your best to make the right choice, it\u2019ll work out. \n\nYou sound like you\u2019re trying. I think having activities centered around the kids is genius! Maybe talk with your ex and make sure he knows that\u2019s all it is so far maybe that could ease some tension.", "ESH. It\u2019s not \u2018child abuse\u2019, but it\u2019s certainly very soon to be introducing kids to a new partner and it would be respectful to come to an agreement with your ex about it before you did it. Like, in three months you\u2019ve already had him meet the kids multiple times? What\u2019s the rush?", "ESH\u2026.your ex is stretching it by saying it\u2019s child abuse but he has a point. It\u2019s entirely too soon to introduce your 5 and 2 year old children to a person you\u2019ve only been dating for 3 months.", "YTA. Three months is not a long enough time to determine if a relationship is \u201cstrong and serious\u201d enough to let your young children get attached to him. You\u2019ve just gotten divorced and are on a rebound. It may work out, but it also may not. It\u2019s not fair to your kids to bring someone into their life that they will get attached to and then have to take that person away at some point. It\u2019s not child abuse, but it\u2019s definitely way too soon.", "YTA. You should have talked to your ex before ever introducing your children to your boyfriend. Even then 3 months is far too soon to be introducing your children to him.", "NAH\n\nI wouldn\u2019t say YTA, but I think it is potentially harmful for your kids. \n\nYour kids world is being drastically changed by having you split from their father. Letting them get to know a new guy that you might stop dating in a few weeks might be really unstabling for them and potentially harmful in the long run. \n\nI think your ex is just worried about that. Probably.", "Kids get attached with ppl quickly and I feel 3 months is too early. Even if the relationship sounds serious you might eventually break up with him and then you're gonna separate the children AGAIN soo I think you are kind of the AH. just because 3 months is too early", "YTA. Three months is too soon. If it's that strong and serious then what's the rush? It can wait 8 months to a year.", "NTA. This is clearly NOT child \"abuse.\" Your children know you have a friend with a child older than they are, and they hang out once in a while. Where's the trauma here?", "NTA it's most definitely not child abuse lol", "This all depends on the scenario\u2026 Have you and the ex discussed having your kids around future partners?  Would you feel it was too soon if the shoe was on the other foot?  If you didn\u2019t discuss this with your ex prior to the meeting I\u2019d say YTA.", "NTA and it\u2019s certainly not child abuse. It is very early though, and the fact that you say its a serious relationship after 3 months is concerning. I wouldn\u2019t recommend meeting kids so soon, especially because if it goes wrong your children lose a new friend. I hope you\u2019re right and it lasts, but it seems naive to introduce your kids so soon", "Info: Did you speak with your ex before introducing them? Seeing as how they're his children too, he has every right to have a say in who the kids meet and when. So it really depends on whether or not you consulted him.", "NTA, while I wouldn't call dating someone for 3 months a \"strong and serious\" relationship there's absolutely nothing wrong with kids going on play dates.\n\nYou're EX is a bit of TA, jealous possibly?", "Your ex is jealous. NTA.", "Not child abuse, but introducing your kids to a new after 3 months isn\u2019t the best idea.\n\nNTA, but don\u2019t think hopping from relationship to relationship in such a short time is healthy.", "Info - Is this \"guy\" someone you met while married?", "\nHe is going too far saying CA, and that isn\u2019t helpful, but if you don\u2019t think it\u2019s a big deal, YTA for that.  It IS a big deal", "Is it just me, or are all the comments talking about \u201coh it\u2019s too soon\u201d really odd? What\u2019s too soon for one person may not be too soon for another. Recently divorced doesn\u2019t mean recently emotionally and romantically separated. Divorce is a legal formality. I grew up in a household that took years to afford the divorce paperwork, but I understood that they were not together. I say NTA, but I\u2019m coming from a place where I was a kid in a situation like this. My mom didn\u2019t let me meet anyone she didn\u2019t trust, and I\u2019d like to think this mom is doing the same.", "YTA it\u2019s not abuse, but if this relationship goes south your kids will be attached to those kids and want to know why they can\u2019t play with their friends anymore. My daughter was 4 when we changed schools and she talked about her classmate for years - you may think they are too young to form friendships but they are not. They will not understand why they can\u2019t play with those kids anymore. 3 months is way too soon to introduce a boyfriend + his kids.", "ESH. This is something I think should be run past your kids father before introducing a partner into your kids life. So YTA for not co-parenting well but he\u2019s also TA for claiming abuse. This is not abuse.", "Yta. Child abuse is stretching it. But three months is still too soon. You don\u2019t know him that well nor what his intentions are with you imo. You are naive to think that there aren\u2019t people who date single parents to get access on their children.", "NTA - Sounds like you're doing things right. Unless there's something specific about this in your divorce decree, you go at **your** pace, using your good mom judgement. With you and your new guy both keeping your kids' hearts first, it sounds like you're on your way to a healthy relationship.", "NTA, but if this is super serious enough to meet the kids, maybe offer your ex a kid less meet up as well. Maybe he just wants to get to know the dude who will be around his kiddos.", "NTA. Your ex sounds insufferable.", "NTA, your ex is an idiot.  Understanding if your kids can get along with his kids is part of figuring out if a relationship can work.  It isn\u2019t \u201cchild abuse\u201d.", "NTA especially as you are still not telling them you two are together. \n\nTo the kids (both yours and his), it probably looks like you two are friends who hang out, and the kids also gain friends while they play together. \n\nThis could be a great foundation for both of you parents to build a relationship with the other person's kids(s) while the kids also get close and depending on how time goes by become one family. It is just definitely too soon yet to tell them.", "Mild YTA. Recently divorced + dating three months does not equal a stable relationship. Your kids have been through enough change. I think you should back off of joint activities, and rethink your timeline for introducing your kids.  \n\n\nETA: Your Ex was wrong to call it child abuse but he's right to be extremely protective about who's around his kids.", "I have friends who\u2019s do the introduction early and the. Ones who waited months.  it completely on your relationship and your feelings on the matter.    If your introduction is this is my friend.  What\u2019s the problem. Friends hangout if it\u2019s more then handle it as your relationship develops.     \n\nIt sounds like your doing a great job\n\nGood luck for the future \n\nNTA", "NTA. You're the mother and an adult - you get to decide when and how your kids meet someone you're dating. Anyone saying Y T A is, well, wrong. Most of them are saying \"3 months is too soon\" but they're not you. They're not in your relationship. Their opinion doesn't really matter. For the few that are saying Y T A because your ex should get to choose when and how your kids meet another person, that's not how it works. You don't have to run every parenting decision by your ex, and that includes when and how your kids meet people.\n\nOh, and as someone who actually was physically abused as a child, people need to stop every f-ing thing \"child abuse.\" I wish the only thing that happened to me as a kid was that a parent introduced me to a boyfriend after 3 months.", "NTA, you have been dating for three months. You are not shoving an agenda of a blended family on them.  Right now, they just see this as play dates. As they slowly get to know each other than you can start to let them know that you are more than just friends.  This is the opposite of child abuse.  Your ex is upset that you are moving on and the kids are enjoying their time with the child of the person you are now seeing.", "NTA the kids don\u2019t know he\u2019s a partner.", "Yeah YTA. 3 months is like a day. You shouldn\u2019t be introducing any boyfriend to your kids unless you\u2019ve been dating at least a year and it\u2019s very likely to turn into marriage.", "NTA. I can see why he\u2019s your ex though. Good for you for moving on from him. Id be a bit concerned if your new guy didn\u2019t also have a kid himself.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Meeting kids in under 3 months as it's been multiple times.\nGot to be careful 1.who you introduce to kids. \n2.that it will be long term, if things dont work out you'll need to explain to the kids why they wont see their new friend anymore or parents new friend.", "I\u2019m not saying YTA but that is very soon\nAnd your children are very young\nYour ex may also be upset that you didn\u2019t discuss this with him\nAnd even though you are separated that\u2019s a big step for both you and the kids", "Not child abuse, but it is soon. It doesn't matter if they are \"play dates\", kids can put two and two together. Three months is soon to be so close. So many relationships do not work out, and i see dad's issue with introducing them to someone so soon.", "NTA\n\nYour ex sounds jealous.", "ESH\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI used to know a woman who had a new guy every 3-5 months and he was always \"the one\" so she would start bonding them to her sons... her poor kids would get attached to their new friends and their new friends father just for them all to just disseapear one day. It didn't matter if these new people in their little lives were introduced as the boyfriend and his kids or just as new friends, they lost a group of people they had fun with and felt comfortable with.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt's not child abuse but it will hurt your children if you start introducing new people and having them vanish one day if things don't work out with dad.", "They are just using play dates, he has not been introduced as partner.", "What rubbish.  The kids are having a play date and it is outside the home.  If the other parent was a woman no one would think twice.  The ex is jealous and acting out and it is no one else's business.  A new partner should also be a friend and if he is also being supportive then that is great.  When I was single with two young children, the only stipulation I had was that any dates could not come to the house unless the kids were staying with my ex.  I had several male friends where our children used to have play dates and it was purely platonic; it was actually good that my children could have positive male influence as their Father was a bit of an arse.\n\nThe OP is NTA", "She's not introducing the guy as someone she's dating though, it's really just a playdate in the jump park with a 5-year-old and a 7-year-old? If the relationship doesn't work out, then so what? The child remembers playing with another kid a few times at a park, but they aren't going to form attachments to the parent of the kid they played with.", "So far all they have done is play dates, the kids have not been told that they are dating.", "No, he does not have any right to approve anyone the kids meet during mom's parenting time unless that's in a parenting plan filed with the court. If every ex with joint custody had this right, the kids wouldn't ever be allowed to interact with anyone if their parents didn't get along.", "No, meet him a full 5 months after the divorce.", "I mean when I was 5 and my mom set me up on a play date with someone I\u2019d never met, I put two and two together and knew it wasn\u2019t so I could meet and play with random strangers. Kids are pretty perceptive.", "In just three months of dating they\u2019ve had these play dates a couple of times. Kids do start to get attached to people they see often, and if OP is starting the simple play dates this early she\u2019ll likely be graduating to more serious stuff within a couple of months. There\u2019s just no good reason to rush meeting the kids and so many good reasons not to.", "Kids aren\u2019t stupid. The older one knows what\u2019s going on.", "So far, she's basically going by the book on how to introduce someone new to your kids. The timeline's gonna be different for everyone, it's up to the parent. I used to be the ex in this scenario... accepting that you have to trust your former spouse's judgment can be a tough pill to swallow. This is most definitely not \"child abuse\".", "NTA - Sounds like your ex hasn't moved on yet.", "We had a girl move in HS from a town away and clicked in our friend group.
