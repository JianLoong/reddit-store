My wife (33f) gets upset when I get home and after eating dinner want to get a couple of rounds of COD in. My wife is a SAHM with our 18 month old and thinks it\u2019s absolutely criminal that I want to get some decompress time at the end of the day. My daughter is still in the mommy all the time phase so she prefers to spend more time with my wife than I. Usually when I get home I will eat dinner, do whatever honey-do\u2019s she has for me, and then play for a little. After I\u2019m done I will join them and spend time with my family which usually is her watching a movie/show and I reading the same book to my daughter 10 times lol. My wife says that even when I\u2019m chilling with them I spend too much time on my phone. While we are all hanging out if my daughter is asking for my attention I will stop what I\u2019m doing and do whatever she\u2019s asking me to do. Whenever she wants to go back to mommy I will browse Twitter or Reddit since I usually have absolutely zero interest in what she is watching. She accuses me of being absent/not present since I don\u2019t focus all my free time on her and the baby. Also side note she is currently 20 weeks pregnant. \n\nSo AITA?\n\nEdit: I get up at 5am and usually fall asleep by 930-10pm.

You can wait until your kid goes to bed to play your game and interact with your family when you get home from work.

Your wife is asking you to spend more time with your family. Can you wait until the little one is down to play ?", "NTA. Needing to decompress after that long at work before you can switch to family time is absolutely reasonable. My bf needs this. The transition time is necessary for him most days and I've just learned not to try and have a convo while he's in those 30 or so minutes because his brain just can't after a full day of having to be fully engaged at work. If you;re absent for hours each time that would become an issue but 30-60 minutes then spending time with them is reasonable.", "I have two kids under 4 and fortunate enough to be employed with a company that has great benefits so I was able to take time off and be a stay at home dad for 4 months each for both kids. I thought it was going to be fun but oh boy being a stay at home parent is an eye opener.\n\nYour whole day revolves around the kid! When kids wake up at random hours you have to take care of them, then In the morning you wake up, change diaper, prepare breakfast, feed the baby, entertain the baby, put the baby for nap, get lunch ready/other chores, when kid wakes up feed the baby, entertain baby again, another nap time, get dinner ready/ do other chores, entertain baby again then your SO is finally home and all you want for yourself is maybe 15-30 minutes to poop alone or take a shower but no as opposed to giving you time, your partner pulls the \u2018im tired from work\u2019 and would rather unwind and play video games. YTA it\u2019s a lot of work being a stay at home parent. I look at being at work as my vacation as it\u2019s way less tiring.", "YTA sounds like you want in home accessories not a wife and children. Why on earth did you go ahead with another kid?\n\nYeah you need alone time, but mate, you're taking liberties.", "YTA Baby is with mom all day, she needs a break too. Her job comes with no breaks or vacation and no time to decompress because she's still watching the baby when you're home. \n\nGrow up, be a real father, and spend that time playing games and decompressing with your child before they goto bed. Give your wife a break. Enjoy the time with your baby, they grow up fast AND if you're not around now, they won't be around when they're older.", "YTA, as a SAHM with three kids, as soon as my husband walked in the door he took over with the kids.  So guess what?  There wasn\u2019t much of a mommy only phase with the kids cuz their dad was involved. What a lame excuse for not wanting to be a dad. Decompress my ass, when you become a parent you don\u2019t get to do that when the kid is awake.  Wow, just wow!\nBTW, my husband and I have been married almost 40 years and our kids adore him!", "YTA, where is your wifes time to decompress here huh? At least your workday ends, from the sound of your post your wifes never does. Be a better Husband and Father.", "YTA.  When does your wife get to deconpress?  I get needing you time,  maybe have a schedule where you guys trade off days getting an hour alone to do that,  but you are being solidly unreasonable at present", "YTA. What do you do to ensure that your wife gets 30-60 minutes of decompression every day? And no, napping doesn't count because your wife is sleep-deprived from being a SAHM to a toddler.", "YTA You may work 12 hours a day but you\u2019re a dad 24 hours a day.  You have 4 competing interests: your family, your job, sleep, and your personal time.  Right now you are giving 1/2 of your time to your job.  Then you have to divide the remainder of your time between sleep, family and yourself. You can\u2019t really take much time from sleep - I\u2019ll assume you sleep about 6 hours. Now you have 4 hours for yourself and your family. Take an hour for yourself. 3 hours for your family.  Is that enough time?  Are you happy being a father and husband for only 3 hours a day?\n\nCompare that with your wife. She is a SAHM 24 hours a day. She is always on call. She constantly has a kid attached to her. Even when your daughter is asleep, your wife can\u2019t get too into something because your daughter could wake up at any time.  \n\nHonestly, your household sounds very stressed. You are stretching yourself thin. Your wife has no reprieves. It\u2019s easy for me to say, you need a less demanding job especially if you want more you time. The 12 hr workday day and stay at home mom isn\u2019t making either of you happy.", "YTA - you\u2019re wife needs your help. She\u2019s looking after a toddler all day, growing another baby and then when you get home you want to decompress. When does she get time out. You need to start stepping up now as there will be a new baby soon. \n\nYou say that they nap during the day. Are you sure about that? I\u2019m sure at 18 months your daughter does, but does your wife? The most condescending phrase I heard as a mum was \u201csleep when baby sleeps\u201d. Not all babies / toddlers sleep for lengths during the day. Mine certainly didn\u2019t. And even if they do, there\u2019s no saying that the parent is able to fall asleep at that time. \n\nIt\u2019s hard being home with a small child and one of the biggest aspects of that is the lack of adult company. You gaming is depriving her of even more company.", "ESH,\n\nWhile I understand people calling you YTA for not spending genuine time and helping your wife out. It is rather crucial to be there in the moment rather than absent as that can shape the baby's development and interpersonal relationship with the parent. But I also understand that coming after a long day of work is exhausting, so no point in forcing yourself to look after someone half-heartedly if you're exhausted.\n\n I say ESH because you guys could communicate what each of you need and compromise a little, especially during a difficult time for your wife. You could let your wife know that you'd feel exhausted after a day at work so you wish to recharge by playing games and then you'll devote your time afterward to the baby so she could relax a bit. She would tell you what she needs as well.", "Your wife is telling you that she needs adult attention after spending ALL day with a baby. When you\u2019re there, you are constantly doing everything you can to engage in escapism. She\u2019s telling you, but you aren\u2019t listening. The day will come when she doesn\u2019t complain to you at all. And it will be because she has already left you in her mind. The only thing left, will be the packing. Once it gets to that point, there will be no fixing it. YTA", "hope it's not too late to say YTA, despite you already knowing it!", "YTA......\n\n\nWhy does the game come before your CHILD?!", "I dont think YTA but i also think youre at fault. set a certain amount of time for games and the rest of the time be present. Being a SAHM means youre on the clock 24/7 and she would like her husband to be present.", "YTA. Play video games after baby goes to bed. Your wife needs a break and I say that as a SAHD. The reason the baby is fixated on mom is because you aren\u2019t spending enough time bonding with it. I get that work is long and hard, but parenting takes priority.", "A soft YTA but this does sound difficult. You want some time to decompress after working/commuting all day, and your wife wants you to spend quality time with the family. Both very reasonable. Does she also want some alone time to decompress? Especially with another baby on the way, I\u2019d encourage you and your wife to have a discussion about finding some balance during the week so that you each have time to decompress and also have quality time together as a family, or at least work towards that some days.", "YTA. Worst thing is you\u2019ll never understand why.\n\nEdit - I spoke before OP\u2019s edits. They are really positive and I hope they work out the best way forward for them. \nOP you clearly work very hard for your family which is of course commendable. Maybe have your downtime more loosely scheduled to help it fit in better. The first part of parenting is hard, it will pass. I sincerely wish you all the best \n\nOthers - I take my judgement as TA in my comment. OP has proved me wrong in this instance. I let past experience cloud me and (like many on this subreddit) commented too quickly.\n\nIt is simply impossible for a full time working dad and a sahm to ever truely understand the others point of view. \n\nEnough Reddit for me for a while.", "Maybe schedule time to read a book to the baby.  Just get into the habit of it and make it apart of yours and hers nightly routine. There are lots of children books. The baby maybe soothed by sitting with you and listening to your void which also gives your wife time for herself. She needs to also decompress. \n\nI agree with the other poster that said video games are for after the baby has went to bed and chores are done.", "Yta and if you bonded more with your child, there wouldn't be what you call \"mommy all the time phase\" . You're too self centered", "NAH, but word of advice: I have two kids, 1yo and a 4yo. I work until 5:00, and then my wife goes to her part time job until 8:00 (It's something she loves, her outlet, her decompression) I cook, clean up, and put the kids to bed. Every. Day. once that is done, I'm free to game until I pass out at 3:am if I wanted to. I'm also the one that gets up with the kids at night to give her a break, because she's with them during the days. \n\nIt's hard. *Really* hard. But you can get your \"me\" time in, AND prioritize your family. Find what works for everyone, and be present, you'll miss the time if you don't.", "YTA. Play your games AFTER bedtime. Your daughter is probably asleep by 8 at the absolute latest. After she\u2019s in bed, do your 30min - 1 hour game time. You get your game time, your wife and daughter get family time, everybody wins", "YTA.  With time being so precious, it's a slap in the face to your wife for you to automatically decompress by avoiding her and playing childish games by yourself.  Keep in mind, she probably hasn't had many adult conversations in the time you were gone.  Focus more on being a husband and dad and less about being some secret ops guy killing 8-year olds online.", "Dude. In 5 months you are going to be dealing with a newborn and a terrible twos toddler. You need to get this worked out now, because the shit is really going to hit the fan.\n\nIs your wife basically not getting any her time until the kid is in bed? Because that's unsustainable. She needs a break too. And it's going to be harder once baby 2 gets here.", "YTA\n\nBeing a full-time parent to an 18 month old is exhausting \u2014 she is as exhausted as you are. \n\nPay more attention to your daughter \u2014 actively engage her, don\u2019t force her to ask for your attention. And you\u2019re about to have another! The fun is only starting. \n\nSmall children are very time-consuming. Get some private time together via family/friends/sitters if you can. Take turns being responsible on weekends. \n\nRemember: This too shall pass. And they grow up really, really fast in hindsight.", "YTA, being there is more than sitting in the same room. And why are you not reading to your kid or playing with them? You get home at 6, do honey do\u2019s and eat, so it\u2019s what, 8 now. Then you go play video games for an hour or so. It\u2019s what, 9, 9:30 now. What time do you go to sleep to get up at 5?  10pm or so?  You have your priorities off or at least your definition of what decompress is. Your decompression time should be the time you spend with your wife and kid.", "YTA. Do you not realize that your pregnant wife is working more than you are? Put down the phone, video games, and whatever else is distracting you from your family!\n\nAlso, as a side note, it is perfectly developmentally appropriate for an 18-month old to request the same book 10 times. It's how they learn language. And yes, it's annoying as all get out, but you're skipping out on precious bonding time with your child.", "YTA - I get people need to decompress, but is it really a stretch to wait until your daughter is asleep to play video games?

Your daughter is in her mommy phase not because of her being 18 months old but for you ignoring her and not giving a shit about bonding with her. Even reading her a book feels obnoxious to you. You should be building the foundation of your bond on inconditional love from you to her and she is only finding how you despise her. It's sad.", "At the very least I\u2019m so glad to hear OP is able to accept his judgement graciously and is apparently taking people\u2019s suggestions/advice to be more present and take some of the load off of his wife.", "So to recap: you go to work, and your wife works all day taking care of a toddler. Based on your edit it seems she is solely responsible for preparing all three meals and all childcare from when she wakes up to basically dinner time - at which point you play on your phone and occasionally pay attention to your toddler. During this time, your wife gets some time to watch tv - but not really though because the toddler is going to her frequently during this time so this isn\u2019t \u201cher time\u201d but rather COparenting time. Then you eat dinner (which I assume your wife cooked), and then you have dedicated you time playing video games while you wife goes back to being solely responsible for a toddler. Oh and also you go to bed and she stays up with the kid, and is also solely in charge of bedtime. \n\nSo in her entire waking day, your wife gets no alone time and no real adult interaction besides you sitting nearby while playing on your phone. She gets no time for herself away from her child. You claim to do whatever \u201choney do\u201d tasks she sets you but do you help determine what needs doing? You go to work where you interact with adults, probably pee when you want to, and just generally get time away from home and constant childcare. When you leave work, you LEAVE work. Your wife is never off the clock. She is NEVER free to unplug and relax - and you\u2019re (checks notes) whining because she has the audacity to be upset with this arrangement and ask for what she needs. \n\nMy dude. YTA. Put the phone down, keep your daughter entertained and let your wife shower, watch an episode of a show, or just maybe sit and enjoy her family. Spend time with HER after dinner and let her talk to an adult.

(Highly recommend the last one to get back in your wife's good graces) \n\nNow you're probably thinking but I need my sleep!

But you need to organize a better schedule where you both get a little free time in.\n\nAlso I get that some kids wants the other parent and she\u2019s home more. But you need to step in sometimes when she only wants mommy. She wants mommy because she\u2019s used to mommy taking care of her and paying attention to her. It\u2019s not enough to just put the phone down when the child asks for attention, you need to be actively giving it. Your child will pick up on you being on your phone, and they\u2019re already picking up that you\u2019re not around much because your work so long (not your fault) but then you come home and they see you retreat or be on your phone.

Gaming addiction (not saying you have one but my SO does) is so toxic for families. Resentment builds up quick.", "YTA- I\u2019m going to tell you this as someone who experiences this.  My husband worked long hours too and to decompress he would come home and play COD.  When the kids were small this infuriated me because I had already spent the whole day taking care of them, had no adult interaction and now that he\u2019s home, it\u2019s more of the same.  I fantasized about smashing his gaming computer to smithereens, but I\u2019m not actually psychotic, so I never did it.  I did all the parenting work (or at least most of it, because he would show up if I snapped or nagged enough). Now my kids are older teenagers and they come to me for everything.  When we were struggling with our daughter at 16, he tried to step in and she flat out yelled at him \u201cYou don\u2019t even know me! And I don\u2019t care to know you\u201d.  He was devastated.  Now our son is 17 and he comes to me for girlfriend advice and when he has car issues.  I will ask him \u201cwhy didn\u2019t you call dad? I don\u2019t know car stuff\u201d and he shrugs his shoulders.  \n\nMy point, don\u2019t be that dad.  I didn\u2019t know how to change his behavior or make him see the damage that he was doing by not being \u201cpresent\u201d for them when they were young.  He regrets it so much now and he can\u2019t get that time back.  And don\u2019t take it wrong, because I do appreciate the life he gave us and that I was able to stay home with our kids.  He gave us a very stable life, but at what expense?", "YTA when is your wife getting decompress time?", "I\u2019m a 53f with a grown son and tween granddaughter, I like gaming too so I think it\u2019s ridiculous to call you childish for wanting to spend time decompressing with COD. \n\nWhat I do think is you aren\u2019t being fair with your wife. She\u2019s spent all day at her job too. And she\u2019d like to spend time with you. So when you get home, take 5 minutes and then spend time with her and your daughter.\n\nUntil the baby is asleep you are both on duty. I know how boring entertaining a baby is. I\u2019ve sat on the floor and rolled a ball, built block towers and played peek-a-boo until my brain was leaking out my ears. But that\u2019s how children learn. And you need to be incorporating lessons into play. Because giving her a good start is your job.\n\nSo if you are playing with stuffed toys, you name each animal and make their sound as you pretend the teddies are chasing her. If you have blocks, you name the colors. If you are reading her favorite book for the twentieth time, point to the words as you read them. Parents are their children\u2019s first teachers and you are falling down. \n\nYou are also falling down as a husband. After the baby is asleep, don\u2019t pick up your phone. I\u2019ll bet when you were dating you sat on the couch with her and held her hand and watched tv with her. Probably made out or flirted during commercial breaks. If you think the little bit of time you spend with your daughter is immensely boring, imagine how her day was. Your wife needs adult conversation and interaction. If you don\u2019t want to watch her show you can give her a foot or back rub or scalp massage during it. I guarantee she would appreciate the attention and probably is hurting. Offering to put lotion on her feet and/or legs is good too. She probably can\u2019t do that as easily right now. Giving her conversation and physical affection (and sorry, sex doesn\u2019t count for that) will keep her happier in your marriage and feeling more fulfilled as a person, wife and mother.\n\nFor the time being, you both need to give each other breaks on the weekends. You can spend some time gaming without interruption and in return she can take a nap, a bubble bath, read or however she wants to decompress while you take 100% charge of the baby for a set time.\n\nSo, yeah, YTA. \n\nBut because you care enough to ask and seem to be taking in the feedback, I have high hopes you won\u2019t be TA for long.

When he gets home, he pops in to say hi, goes to get changed out of his uniform, has a bathroom break then he's ready to \"tag in\" for daddy duties and give me a hand. Doesn't matter how tired he is, who our son is favouring that day, that he needs to decompress and is desperate to play video games and have his own time, he helps out and is a dad. Once our son is in bed is our time to chill out and decompress and do whatever we want, not before. Although he's been out the house and working all day, I've also been doing my job as a parent all day(with less breaks and social interaction), the exact same as your wife. I really hope you can have a talk with your wife and try to see things from her point out view and everyone commenting and change your routine and perspective to one that is agreeable to both of your needs, she needs that break just as much as you do.\n\nEdit: typo", "YTA - look, I get it. Toddlers aren\u2019t always exciting because they like to repeat activities to the nth degree. But my dude, you have to pretend to be interested.

The one year old will obviously need a lot of attention and constant supervision. touch grass dude", "YTA Not because you need to decompress but because you are not active or present when you are with your child. You take your lack of interest in what they're doing to mean you don't have to pay attention. Do you think your wife enjoys all the child programs all day long? Your child wouldn't be so dependent on your wife solely if you were more present with them too. Don't become a stranger to your child. \n\nSometimes being a parent means doing things you don't want to do and putting stuff like video games on the back burner. Maybe you can play more on your days off or while the child is sleeping but you helped create a person and now you must parent them. Give your wife a break. She shouldn't have to do every little thing with a toddler in tow. You mentioned a maid but all that does is clean up the house. Your wife is still watching your child.

You\u2019re a service manager, you nitpick what everyone does wrong all day and then play damage control to customers.

Some days I get to. Some days I don\u2019t and that\u2019s okay because being a parent comes first", "DH did a demanding job when our kids were young.  He would come home and take the baby for a walk while I finished dinner.  Our policy was that from 7am-7pm his job was working, my job was active parenting.  Once he got home everything remaining (chores, dinner, childcare etc) was 50-50.  I would often choose dishes rather than play with my child because it was less exhausting than a toddler at 7pm.  Those hours from 5pm-bedtime are usually the most challenging of the day, there is a lot to fit in that time and everyone is overly tired.  If DH had sloped off to spend an hour alone in the evening I would have been very resentful.  You're not only doing that, but then when you are with them you are not being fully present and using the excuse that your child likes mummy better to make your wife do most of the parenting.    \n\n\nI don't doubt you are very tired after a long day and working, but you get to have your commute time and lunch and coffee breaks to have some minutes to yourself, your wife likely has to even go to the toilet while answering questions and watching your kid.  She probably gets no more than two minutes tops break at any time during the day, she is responsible for keeping someone alive 24/7.  DH often would use his lunch to take a nap so that he wasn't so wiped when he got home.  \n\n\n  Actively parenting has to come first when you have children so that you have a close bond with them.  Bonding comes from doing the boring ordinary caring tasks more than anything fun.  Changing diapers, bathing, feeding etc.  This is time to put money in the bonding bank for you to withdraw when she is a difficult teenager. If she grows up with you as a constantly involved and active parent she will be more likely to listen when you have something important to tell her later in life.  \n\n\n  You might suggest to your wife that you do the pre-bed routine such as bath, diaper and reading or feeding your daughter dinner and then clearing dinner and playing (yes you can do both at once!) with her while your wife takes a shower, if your daughter gets used to you doing her bath every night, soon enough she will want you for bath every night.  Kids like routine.  \n\n\nYTA (sorry!)", "Soft YTA. I get that you need to decompress but your wife is home with your child all day and deserves a break too. Sit down with your wife, communicate what you both need and come up with a schedule that works for both of you. It might help if you implement an earlier bedtime for your toddler. For example, my husband works until 4pm. He watches the baby from 4-530. I watch the baby from 530-7 where he can game or do whatever he wants. We both do baby\u2019s bedtime routine together at 7pm. After he\u2019s asleep we eat and get time to hang out together or to do individual activities.", "YTA, my man.

I was with you until you mentioned the little one. My husband decompresses similarly to you when he comes home from work (except shower instead of dinner because of the time). I do the same.

However, it seems her main issue is that you not spending time with her and your daughter - and it\u2019s not the gaming that stopping that, it\u2019s your attitude towards family time. It doesn\u2019t sound like you\u2019re engaged at all in parenting, so no wonder your daughter only wants her mother. You need to do more than just sit in the room with them. No parent is interested in kid TV, but that doesn\u2019t mean you should zone out on your phone every second your daughter or wife isn\u2019t speaking to you. For example, you could initiate activities with your daughter - whether is playing a game or joining whatever she\u2019s doing - but it doesn\u2019t sound like you\u2019re doing any of that.", "YTA because you are underestimating how difficult being a stay at home parent is. \n\nDo you walk to the car alone?

Do you get to go to the bathroom alone? \n\nYou might need to decompress after a long day, but your wife does also. And she likely also needs some adult human conversation. \n\nHonestly, I would suggest resetting the baby\u2019s schedule to an earlier bedtime. If the baby went to bed between 7-8, that would give you time to play some video games, time for you and your wife to hang out together, and time for your wife to have some time to herself.", "I\u2019m all for decompression time and my husband games every day from about 9/10pm to midnight or 2 am on weekends.

But, I have two older kids who are in school, and am currently 28 weeks pregnant. \n\nYour wife doesn't get a break. She doesn't get to have a separate time for herself, or to spend with you.

When does she get her decompress time?", "YTA but you can totally fix it! Ask your wife what would help the most but I would suggest starting with giving her a break from being a SAHM for an hour or two. Maybe that means taking the baby while she does something she wants to do, maybe that means putting your phone in another room and watching an episode of a show with her. I\u2019m sure you can suffer through a show you don\u2019t like for one hour for your wife. Keep in mind, this time is NOT for her to catch up on more chores or household duties while you are being the primary parent. It is for her to mentally, emotionally, and physically recharge from her day. The most important thing is to recognize that being a SAHM is a job too. Domestic labor is grossly undervalued so it might be helpful to think of it in terms of what you would pay to have someone else do everything she is doing. How much would a full time nanny cost? What about laundry service? House cleaning? Cooking meals? That\u2019s what she is contributing to the household. It\u2019s also important to consider the mental toll of limited adult relationships. Unless she\u2019s spending a couple hours a day going out and spending time with other moms she\u2019s carrying a heavy burden of existing for the child and the home. You get to talk to other adults at work, you get occasional breaks, you get to use the restroom alone. She doesn\u2019t. \n\nOf course it\u2019s important for you to have time to relax and decompress. Gaming for an hour a day is great! Just be sure you are giving your wife a break from her 24/7/365 duties too.", "YTA. Does your wife get an hour to do whatever she wants each evening?

You're a father now.  Grow up. How do you not want to spend time with your child when you're gone all day?

My husband worked the same hours as you and came home and played with our kids. He took over 90% with them when he got home, to give me a break, but also because he loved spending time with our kids.

Yes.. \n\nAlready so many great comments here, but I have to echo that you need to find a balance in order for your wife's needs to be met as well. Not only is she spending 24/7 taking care of a toddler majority on her own, she also is not getting enough quality time with you. Sitting in the same room as her but being on your phone is not spending quality time together. \n\nBe more present in those times as a family and I'd also suggest having a few nights where you don't get on the computer - instead give your wife a break or just spend extra time with your family. \n\nYou are both working very hard and are exhausted and you're going to have to work together to achieve a balance so both of your needs can be met as much as possible, bearing in mind that as a spouse and as a parent, sacrifices will have to be made.", "Soft YTA.

I\u2019ll give you my advice from a SAHM with 2 kids and a husband who also worked really long hours when my boys were young. My husband also did what you did, he would come home and need a brain break, problem was I ALSO needed a touch break!

After a little while of this, husband would come home and I\u2019d ask him if he needed a min and he would say \u201c no, I\u2019d rather be with you and the boys.\u201d I think knowing we could lean on one another and the option to take private time helped us realize that being together, even just sitting playing legos with the kids but being in each others company was just as relaxing as the breaks. \n\nYour baby is 18 months old, she honestly wants mom all the time because mom is there all the time. Once you start being more present and showing her that you enjoy your time with her, she will want to spend more time with you! Kids at that age know who to go to if they need/want attention.

Might be something to do with familiarity, I'm not really sure. \n\nAlso, at this age, it's more difficult to get them to help with hobbies as they are usually not age appropriate (choking hazards, not coordinated enough, not tall enough, etc). At 4 or 5 years sure, but not really at 18 months. Might not even be coordinated enough to hold a paint brush.\n\nHowever, your general point does stand.

(A tip I can give: find shorter games that are offline and pausable at a moment\u2019s notice.

He is around on discord during the day if we ever need to talk about things, but he doesn't come online to play with us until after the toddler is put to bed.\n\nWhen ever the toddler wakes up, its very common for him to step away for a while to take care of the baby \"toddler enrage\" we would call it. I think the most important part is to schedule your \"me time\" around the toddler's schedule, so that it would be during the \"low maintenance\" times.\n\nYou work 12 hours a day, your wife takes care of your kid while you are gone. You both share the work once you get home, and put the toddler to bed so you can enjoy your free time while rotating with your wife to take care of the toddler if they wakes.", "Same.
