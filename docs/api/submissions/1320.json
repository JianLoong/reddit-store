You come home, you help,you do the chores with her!!!", "YTA. You have a toddler and your wife is home with them all day, her days are just as busy as yours. You can wait until your kid goes to bed to play your game and interact with your family when you get home from work. You're a parent and a husband, start acting like one or you'll end up an ex-husband and a weekend dad.", "U work 12h a day and then ur expected to take care of a baby right after? \nWhen she goes to her mother are u supposed to just freeze in time and wait?\n\nNta.", "YTA- softly tho. Your wife is asking you to spend more time with your family. Can you wait until the little one is down to play ?", "NTA. Needing to decompress after that long at work before you can switch to family time is absolutely reasonable. My bf needs this. The transition time is necessary for him most days and I've just learned not to try and have a convo while he's in those 30 or so minutes because his brain just can't after a full day of having to be fully engaged at work. If you;re absent for hours each time that would become an issue but 30-60 minutes then spending time with them is reasonable.", "I have two kids under 4 and fortunate enough to be employed with a company that has great benefits so I was able to take time off and be a stay at home dad for 4 months each for both kids. I thought it was going to be fun but oh boy being a stay at home parent is an eye opener.\n\nYour whole day revolves around the kid! When kids wake up at random hours you have to take care of them, then In the morning you wake up, change diaper, prepare breakfast, feed the baby, entertain the baby, put the baby for nap, get lunch ready/other chores, when kid wakes up feed the baby, entertain baby again, another nap time, get dinner ready/ do other chores, entertain baby again then your SO is finally home and all you want for yourself is maybe 15-30 minutes to poop alone or take a shower but no as opposed to giving you time, your partner pulls the \u2018im tired from work\u2019 and would rather unwind and play video games. YTA it\u2019s a lot of work being a stay at home parent. I look at being at work as my vacation as it\u2019s way less tiring.", "YTA sounds like you want in home accessories not a wife and children. Why on earth did you go ahead with another kid?\n\nYeah you need alone time, but mate, you're taking liberties.", "YTA Baby is with mom all day, she needs a break too. Her job comes with no breaks or vacation and no time to decompress because she's still watching the baby when you're home. \n\nGrow up, be a real father, and spend that time playing games and decompressing with your child before they goto bed. Give your wife a break. Enjoy the time with your baby, they grow up fast AND if you're not around now, they won't be around when they're older.", "YTA, as a SAHM with three kids, as soon as my husband walked in the door he took over with the kids.  So guess what?  There wasn\u2019t much of a mommy only phase with the kids cuz their dad was involved. What a lame excuse for not wanting to be a dad. Decompress my ass, when you become a parent you don\u2019t get to do that when the kid is awake.  Wow, just wow!\nBTW, my husband and I have been married almost 40 years and our kids adore him!", "YTA, where is your wifes time to decompress here huh? At least your workday ends, from the sound of your post your wifes never does. Be a better Husband and Father.", "YTA.  When does your wife get to deconpress?  I get needing you time,  maybe have a schedule where you guys trade off days getting an hour alone to do that,  but you are being solidly unreasonable at present", "YTA. What do you do to ensure that your wife gets 30-60 minutes of decompression every day? And no, napping doesn't count because your wife is sleep-deprived from being a SAHM to a toddler.", "YTA You may work 12 hours a day but you\u2019re a dad 24 hours a day.  You have 4 competing interests: your family, your job, sleep, and your personal time.  Right now you are giving 1/2 of your time to your job.  Then you have to divide the remainder of your time between sleep, family and yourself. You can\u2019t really take much time from sleep - I\u2019ll assume you sleep about 6 hours. Now you have 4 hours for yourself and your family. Take an hour for yourself. 3 hours for your family.  Is that enough time?  Are you happy being a father and husband for only 3 hours a day?\n\nCompare that with your wife. She is a SAHM 24 hours a day. She is always on call. She constantly has a kid attached to her. Even when your daughter is asleep, your wife can\u2019t get too into something because your daughter could wake up at any time.  \n\nHonestly, your household sounds very stressed. You are stretching yourself thin. Your wife has no reprieves. It\u2019s easy for me to say, you need a less demanding job especially if you want more you time. The 12 hr workday day and stay at home mom isn\u2019t making either of you happy.", "YTA - you\u2019re wife needs your help. She\u2019s looking after a toddler all day, growing another baby and then when you get home you want to decompress. When does she get time out. You need to start stepping up now as there will be a new baby soon. \n\nYou say that they nap during the day. Are you sure about that? I\u2019m sure at 18 months your daughter does, but does your wife? The most condescending phrase I heard as a mum was \u201csleep when baby sleeps\u201d. Not all babies / toddlers sleep for lengths during the day. Mine certainly didn\u2019t. And even if they do, there\u2019s no saying that the parent is able to fall asleep at that time. \n\nIt\u2019s hard being home with a small child and one of the biggest aspects of that is the lack of adult company. You gaming is depriving her of even more company.", "ESH,\n\nWhile I understand people calling you YTA for not spending genuine time and helping your wife out. It is rather crucial to be there in the moment rather than absent as that can shape the baby's development and interpersonal relationship with the parent. But I also understand that coming after a long day of work is exhausting, so no point in forcing yourself to look after someone half-heartedly if you're exhausted.\n\n I say ESH because you guys could communicate what each of you need and compromise a little, especially during a difficult time for your wife. You could let your wife know that you'd feel exhausted after a day at work so you wish to recharge by playing games and then you'll devote your time afterward to the baby so she could relax a bit. She would tell you what she needs as well.", "Your wife is telling you that she needs adult attention after spending ALL day with a baby. When you\u2019re there, you are constantly doing everything you can to engage in escapism. She\u2019s telling you, but you aren\u2019t listening. The day will come when she doesn\u2019t complain to you at all. And it will be because she has already left you in her mind. The only thing left, will be the packing. Once it gets to that point, there will be no fixing it. YTA", "hope it's not too late to say YTA, despite you already knowing it!", "YTA......\n\n\nWhy does the game come before your CHILD?!", "I dont think YTA but i also think youre at fault. set a certain amount of time for games and the rest of the time be present. Being a SAHM means youre on the clock 24/7 and she would like her husband to be present.", "YTA. Play video games after baby goes to bed. Your wife needs a break and I say that as a SAHD. The reason the baby is fixated on mom is because you aren\u2019t spending enough time bonding with it. I get that work is long and hard, but parenting takes priority.", "A soft YTA but this does sound difficult. You want some time to decompress after working/commuting all day, and your wife wants you to spend quality time with the family. Both very reasonable. Does she also want some alone time to decompress? Especially with another baby on the way, I\u2019d encourage you and your wife to have a discussion about finding some balance during the week so that you each have time to decompress and also have quality time together as a family, or at least work towards that some days.", "YTA. Worst thing is you\u2019ll never understand why.", "Maybe schedule time to read a book to the baby.  Just get into the habit of it and make it apart of yours and hers nightly routine. There are lots of children books. The baby maybe soothed by sitting with you and listening to your void which also gives your wife time for herself. She needs to also decompress. \n\nI agree with the other poster that said video games are for after the baby has went to bed and chores are done.", "Yta and if you bonded more with your child, there wouldn't be what you call \"mommy all the time phase\" . You're too self centered", "NAH, but word of advice: I have two kids, 1yo and a 4yo. I work until 5:00, and then my wife goes to her part time job until 8:00 (It's something she loves, her outlet, her decompression) I cook, clean up, and put the kids to bed. Every. Day. once that is done, I'm free to game until I pass out at 3:am if I wanted to. I'm also the one that gets up with the kids at night to give her a break, because she's with them during the days. \n\nIt's hard. *Really* hard. But you can get your \"me\" time in, AND prioritize your family. Find what works for everyone, and be present, you'll miss the time if you don't.", "YTA. Play your games AFTER bedtime. Your daughter is probably asleep by 8 at the absolute latest. After she\u2019s in bed, do your 30min - 1 hour game time. You get your game time, your wife and daughter get family time, everybody wins", "YTA.  With time being so precious, it's a slap in the face to your wife for you to automatically decompress by avoiding her and playing childish games by yourself.  Keep in mind, she probably hasn't had many adult conversations in the time you were gone.  Focus more on being a husband and dad and less about being some secret ops guy killing 8-year olds online.", "Dude. In 5 months you are going to be dealing with a newborn and a terrible twos toddler. You need to get this worked out now, because the shit is really going to hit the fan.\n\nIs your wife basically not getting any her time until the kid is in bed? Because that's unsustainable. She needs a break too. And it's going to be harder once baby 2 gets here.", "YTA\n\nBeing a full-time parent to an 18 month old is exhausting \u2014 she is as exhausted as you are. \n\nPay more attention to your daughter \u2014 actively engage her, don\u2019t force her to ask for your attention. And you\u2019re about to have another! The fun is only starting. \n\nSmall children are very time-consuming. Get some private time together via family/friends/sitters if you can. Take turns being responsible on weekends. \n\nRemember: This too shall pass. And they grow up really, really fast in hindsight.", "YTA, being there is more than sitting in the same room. And why are you not reading to your kid or playing with them? You get home at 6, do honey do\u2019s and eat, so it\u2019s what, 8 now. Then you go play video games for an hour or so. It\u2019s what, 9, 9:30 now. What time do you go to sleep to get up at 5?  10pm or so?  You have your priorities off or at least your definition of what decompress is. Your decompression time should be the time you spend with your wife and kid.", "YTA. Do you not realize that your pregnant wife is working more than you are? Put down the phone, video games, and whatever else is distracting you from your family!\n\nAlso, as a side note, it is perfectly developmentally appropriate for an 18-month old to request the same book 10 times. It's how they learn language. And yes, it's annoying as all get out, but you're skipping out on precious bonding time with your child.", "YTA - I get people need to decompress, but is it really a stretch to wait until your daughter is asleep to play video games? She\u2019s 18 months so I\u2019m guessing her bedtime can\u2019t be more than an hour or two after you get home from work at 6pm.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
