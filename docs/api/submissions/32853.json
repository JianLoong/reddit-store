I'm upset at what my husband got me for my birthday. Don't know if Im the ahole for feeling like this, or if he is for what he did.\n\nSo my birthday hasn't happened yet, it is tomorrow. Now you may ask how do I know what he got me. Well, we share our amazon account and I got a notification that a few packages were on their way. Im the one who mostly  uses our amazon account, and I know I have not ordered anything recently. I opened the notification because I thought someone had gotten into our account and ordered some stuff using our cards. But no, upon seeing the items in the order i knew it was him. \n\nIm super upset that he ordered these items this morning. A day before my birthday. We are currently carpooling to work. What was he expecting to do when we got home together and all those packages are there on our front porch?\n\nLast week I asked him if he was planning to get me anything because he had not asked me if I wanted anything in particular. He said he was but again did not asked me anything. I've been throwing hints at him these past few weeks that I want a new pair of crocs to wear as slippers around the house, that I need a new black winter coat, that im searching for a pair of black booties, that I need professional clothes for work, perfume and skincare im looking for.  Apparently all my hints fell on deaf ears.\n\nTo give you context I love my golden retriever dogs and reggeaton music.\n\nWell he got me golden retriever earrings\nA t shirt with a golden retriever \nA calendar of golden retrievers\nGolden retriever stickers\nAnd a blanket with karol g's album artwork.\n\nThose earrings i was going to buy them but I even told him I decided against it because i really wouldnt wear them.\nThe shirt he got me is not my style. I dont own anything like that, even on my off days. The shirt is not even perzonalized.\nI got a calendar a few weeks ago, and dont need another one.\nIm turning 36, what am i going to do with stickers???\nBlanket is cute, but i already have like 100 throw blankets.\n\nIm just so upset because i pride myself in buying thoughtful gifts for him. It takes me weeks to get his gifts together. I feel he couldnt be bother to go to the store to try to find me something or order from another website. Amazon screems I forgot and im lazy. And he was at home all weekend long doing nothing.\n\nI dont know if I should tell him how i feel now. We are celebrating over dinner with friends and we always open our gifts in front on everyone. I dont want to make a scene in front of everyone but i just want to cry about it.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1702338879, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18g85y8/aita_for_being_upset_at_what_my_husband_got_me/", "score": 11, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

That said, you are leaning towards being in the wrong.\n\nI guarantee that he doesn't recall a single one of your \"hints\". If you want something specific, clearly communicate it. Otherwise, he will try and find something unexpected as a surprise.\n\nIn this case, he wasn't thoughtless. He knew you liked something and went out and found items related to that thing. He may have missed the mark, but that doesn't mean that it was without thought. It's not a generic gift-card or gas-station flowers.\n\nAlso, some of your hinted gifts ideas are really bad ones. With shoes, coats, and clothing items, you really need to try them on to determine whether or not they suit you. Items can look really different on the body than they do on the hanger/website images. etc. Then there is the fact that women's sizing is seriously inconsistent. Even if he knows your normal size, he has a chance of getting it wrong when ordering it. Its setting him up for failure.", "NTA... but if I were your husband I would want you to tell me so I could do what I could at that point to make your birthday as good as possible as well as return them and get you something else, even if it wouldn't make it in time.\n\nIt's tough as a married couple. In general my wife and I buy the things we want when we want them, so there isn't a ton left. As thoughtful as she may try and be, it often isn't really what I would buy. I don't blame her, I think I am tough to buy for. \n\nAlso, look at your communication in your marriage. You mention dropping hints and him not getting them... that also means you weren't successful at communicating when you thought you were. Hints are a horrible way of communicating something that matters, don't set the relationship up for failure by using them.", "NAH\n\nI wanted to say N T A because those gifts are what you\u2019d get a little girl who loves golden retrievers.\n\nStill, I hesitate to call him TAH because maybe there\u2019s another big gift to go with it all, or maybe he\u2019s just bad at it. \n\nI feel like you should just roll with it though. He got you some cute stuff he probably thought you\u2019d like. Maybe he did forget, maybe he didn\u2019t think on it very hard. On balance, maybe that\u2019s all okay - you know him better than I do, so your call.", "NTA\n\ngifts given with 1/2 ass effort suck almost as much as no gift... like, couldn't he even make a run to Bath & Body Works?\n\nalso, most folks should know to give a spouse a heads up NOT to look at Amazon shared accounts around birthdays/gift giving time.", "So stop getting him thoughtful gifts. Put in the amount of effort he does.", "well op if your so upset about this then cancel the dinner so your not embarrassed and when ur done that u can have a sit down with him or you can tell him in future not to bother buying you a gift.  \n\nat least he managed to get u something which is more than alot get.  however it just might be there is a taste level difference or you have more time to be thoughtful on his gift and he doesnt have the time.", "YTA. Even if you put that much thought into gifts, the fact of the matter is that a lot of people don\u2019t. It\u2019s often not because they don\u2019t care, but because gift giving isn\u2019t their love language/as important to them.", "NTA - Did you cancel the order? I would've.", "NTA - he\u2019s put no effort into your gifts. He probably literally typed in \u201cGolden Retriever gifts\u201d into Amazon and got the first half a dozen things. You do need to talk to him about it though. Smile when you open them and when you\u2019re alone ask if it\u2019s okay if you return a few things as you won\u2019t use them and use the money to get some things you need. Possibly remind him that you did mention them beforehand. I have to say, I\u2019ve been married for over 10 years now and have had many situations like this and now tell my husband exactly what I want. Tonight I put what I wanted for Xmas in my cart and just passed him my laptop to pay. After being in your position several times and being upset that I organise everything for everyone\u2019s birthdays, Christmas, holidays etc and no-one puts any effort into anything for me, I just plan my own birthday too. Does he put effort into other people\u2019s birthdays? Because if he does, he\u2019s being an AH, but if he doesn\u2019t, it just might not be a big deal to him and that\u2019s not going to change overnight.", "YTA - first of all, you kinda invesated a lot of energy into finding out what he bought you even if the start happewned by accident. But after that, you looked for every single item in detail.\n\nIt seems like you dont have trust into your husband. Instead of letting him surprise you and maybe discuss the things with him afterwards, you are immediately raging over those presents before you even got them. You dont give him a chance at all and you dont know what his thoughts are", "NTA. You\u2019ve been telling him what you do want, and what you don\u2019t want (the earrings because you wouldn\u2019t wear them). He looked around, saw you have a lot of blankets and golden retrieve stuff and thought, \u201cbrilliant, I\u2019ll get her this cause she obviously likes these two things.\u201d\n\nit\u2019s okay to be upset. Return it for what you do want.", "YTA. Dude he did put effort. Maybe try appreciating what he got you rather than whining about what he didn\u2019t get you. Oh and be greatful that you have a partner that cares about you", "NTA and my old age thingie tells me you to ask if you are my ex wife, as I believe you may have just won \"points\" in the long-term relationship \"argument bingo\". If I am correct this is a \"high-value\" set of points because it is a \"birthday\" and so these points are set to \"never expire\".\n\nSo - happy birthday - and now you can smile on your birthday knowing you've got that one in the bank for your future with the S.O..", "YTA for getting mad about something that hasn't even happened yet. You don't know if those items are a silly side gift. You don't know if there's something else he might be getting you. If tomorrow comes and goes and there's nothing else, then be upset, but what's the point in being worked up ahead of time?", "YTA and a brat. You could have gotten nothing and honestly you probably should have gotten nothing. Be thankful he even thought about you enough to get you something.", "YTA. Respectfully, it sounds like you\u2019re being picky. Yeah, you gave him ideas on what you actually wanted. But everything he has bought you does sound like it was thoughtful to at least some degree. He\u2019s buying things based on your interests and likes. Not really understanding whether you need it or will use it for sure doesn\u2019t mean he doesn\u2019t love or appreciate you. Just maybe he\u2019s a bit oblivious. \n\nSome people just suck at buying gifts for people, but I think he\u2019s trying based on what you\u2019ve said. Also, most men are shit at picking up hints. He may have not gotten the things you hinted at because he didn\u2019t know exactly which brands, types, sizes, or styles to get. He may have chosen to play it safe with the things he got, thinking they were a safer choice. \n\nThe shirt not being your style doesn\u2019t necessarily mean he\u2019s thoughtless. It\u2019s really hard to buy clothes for people. Shirts tend to be the easiest but it can still be hard to nail someone\u2019s style. \n\nI\u2019ve failed several times with this for my husband so now I just avoid clothes lol. His response was just to laugh good-naturedly and thank me anyway. We used the shirt for painting and then later as a rag before throwing it out. Oh well, lesson learned. He didn\u2019t look the gift horse in the mouth, though and I really appreciated that. Be happy he\u2019s buying you things for you and not just things he likes thinking you will too. This is common and pretty thoughtless. So there\u2019s that at least.\n\nFood for thought.", "NTA. Go out before dinner and buy yourself something you want, a nice something, and wrap it and bring it to the party and give a gift to yourself.  If you want to be nice and not embarrass your husband, put his name on it like he bought it for you.  If you do decide to put his name on it, make sure it is something really, really nice.  Happy birthday!", "NTA- you have the right to be disappointed and I would be too. You need to be gracious and smile when opening the gifts and say in a charming way something like, oh wow thank you sweetheart this is great. Now I won\u2019t need anymore golden retriever stuff. I\u2019ve got everything I need. Put the calendar in the kitchen, sticker in the junk drawer and wear the T-shirt as a sleep shirt and go buy yourself a present. Dude- he took time IN ADVANCE to order something. \n\nLol just be thankful he didn\u2019t spend a lot of money on a bad gift. Now that would be a problem. Just sit in your feels for an hour and then get over it. Amazon wishlist is a good idea, too.", "NTA for being upset but I think you might be TA for acting upset. I\u2019m not trying to be a lame husband apologist here, but it does seem like he\u2019s trying to get you things you might like. Also, final judgment on him will have to wait until we see if he got anything you hinted about. Maybe he also got something not off Amazon so you don\u2019t know about that. \n\nAs far as ordering things last minute, that\u2019s just the way things go sometimes in this Amazon reality we live in. We are 2 weeks out from Christmas and I haven\u2019t even started shopping. I love and appreciate my kids and my other family more than I can express. Getting presents last minute doesn\u2019t negate that.", "NTA.  I know people will say you shouldn't be disappointed, it's the thought that counts, yada yada.  I wonder how those people would react to their partner getting them such useless gifts.  Would they just take it and not be unhappy?  I rather have my husband not get me anything than things that aren't my type or extremely childish.  For the thought to count, the person actually has to put some thought into it.\n\nYour spouse is the one person who should know you better than anyone.  It's insulting to you.  And men are perfectly capable of picking out great, thoughtful gifts for their wives.  All the men I know are able to do just that.  When you open your presents in front of everyone, you're going to feel embarrassed.  I suggest talking to him before you meet up with friends.  Tell him you saw what he ordered, ask him if that's your bday present.  If that's all he got, tell him the presents aren't your type and you will order something for yourself.  It's better to be direct with him before you're in front of others.  Be nice, but very direct.\n\nPersonally, I just straight up tell my husband some options I would like for my bday then he picks one or two.  Some people cannot pick up on hints (myself included).  For next year, just be direct and tell him some things you would like.  If he still doesn't do it, then stop doing so much as well.", "YTA be thankful you have a spouse and that he even got you a gift at all some people don\u2019t have that", "ESH. I HAAATE it when people hint and don't straight up tell me what they want.  Still, dude, you could have made more of an effort than that. \n\nI know what I'm getting for Christmas/my birthday already.  [Syphilis, gonorrhea, HIV, measles, mumps, rubella. ](https://www.giantmicrobes.com/us/)", "I did not. Not gonna lie and say it didnt cross my mind.", "> you kinda invesated a lot of energy\n\nIt takes zero energy to check purchases after getting emails that something that you didn't order shipped\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>you dont know what his thoughts are\n\nHe had no thoughts, that's the issue", "This is such a funny thinking. My husband thinks exactly the same way. \u201cShe has a lot of sth -> she likes it -> I\u2019ll get her more\u201d. I had to explain to him that it is not always the case. And I began writing a wish list (and sharing with him) - with items of different value, so that he can choose what fits his budget, and with direct links where to buy. Sometimes people are just this way (and I find it both funny and annoying at the same time)", "Be grateful for a partner who doesn\u2019t put any real thought into what he gets her? He got her stuff at the last possible minute, and he didn\u2019t listen when she tried to tell him about the things she liked/needed. Out of EVERYTHING she told her husband, he only heard \u201cGolden Retriever\u201d, and just got her G.R. related stuff. He did he absolutely MINIMUM. There is nothing wrong with her wanting him to put the same thought and effort into her birthday as she does to his.", "Wow. You might want to look into therapy.", "I would rather have nothing than things I will never use.", "Also, I don't think using Amazon means he's lazy. You can get everything there. \n\nAnd being upset its showing up the day before your birthday sounds picky too. It's still going to be there before. \n\nI dont see the problem with either of these.", "Nah, women need to stop being grateful for mediocrity", "Wow the bar is loooooooow!  Fkn hell Hahahha", "The bar is in hell at this point and even that\u2019s too high"]}
