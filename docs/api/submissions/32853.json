Now you may ask how do I know what he got me. Well, we share our amazon account and I got a notification that a few packages were on their way. Im the one who mostly  uses our amazon account, and I know I have not ordered anything recently. I opened the notification because I thought someone had gotten into our account and ordered some stuff using our cards. But no, upon seeing the items in the order i knew it was him. \n\nIm super upset that he ordered these items this morning. A day before my birthday. We are currently carpooling to work. What was he expecting to do when we got home together and all those packages are there on our front porch?\n\nLast week I asked him if he was planning to get me anything because he had not asked me if I wanted anything in particular. He said he was but again did not asked me anything. I've been throwing hints at him these past few weeks that I want a new pair of crocs to wear as slippers around the house, that I need a new black winter coat, that im searching for a pair of black booties, that I need professional clothes for work, perfume and skincare im looking for.  Apparently all my hints fell on deaf ears.\n\nTo give you context I love my golden retriever dogs and reggeaton music.\n\nWell he got me golden retriever earrings\nA t shirt with a golden retriever \nA calendar of golden retrievers\nGolden retriever stickers\nAnd a blanket with karol g's album artwork.\n\nThose earrings i was going to buy them but I even told him I decided against it because i really wouldnt wear them.\nThe shirt he got me is not my style. I dont own anything like that, even on my off days. The shirt is not even perzonalized.\nI got a calendar a few weeks ago, and dont need another one.\nIm turning 36, what am i going to do with stickers???\nBlanket is cute, but i already have like 100 throw blankets.\n\nIm just so upset because i pride myself in buying thoughtful gifts for him. It takes me weeks to get his gifts together. I feel he couldnt be bother to go to the store to try to find me something or order from another website. Amazon screems I forgot and im lazy. And he was at home all weekend long doing nothing.\n\nI dont know if I should tell him how i feel now. We are celebrating over dinner with friends and we always open our gifts in front on everyone.

That said, you are leaning towards being in the wrong.\n\nI guarantee that he doesn't recall a single one of your \"hints\". If you want something specific, clearly communicate it. Otherwise, he will try and find something unexpected as a surprise.\n\nIn this case, he wasn't thoughtless. He knew you liked something and went out and found items related to that thing. He may have missed the mark, but that doesn't mean that it was without thought. It's not a generic gift-card or gas-station flowers.\n\nAlso, some of your hinted gifts ideas are really bad ones. With shoes, coats, and clothing items, you really need to try them on to determine whether or not they suit you. Items can look really different on the body than they do on the hanger/website images. etc. Then there is the fact that women's sizing is seriously inconsistent. Even if he knows your normal size, he has a chance of getting it wrong when ordering it. Its setting him up for failure.", "NTA... but if I were your husband I would want you to tell me so I could do what I could at that point to make your birthday as good as possible as well as return them and get you something else, even if it wouldn't make it in time.\n\nIt's tough as a married couple. In general my wife and I buy the things we want when we want them, so there isn't a ton left. As thoughtful as she may try and be, it often isn't really what I would buy. I don't blame her, I think I am tough to buy for. \n\nAlso, look at your communication in your marriage. You mention dropping hints and him not getting them... that also means you weren't successful at communicating when you thought you were. Hints are a horrible way of communicating something that matters, don't set the relationship up for failure by using them.", "NAH\n\nI wanted to say N T A because those gifts are what you\u2019d get a little girl who loves golden retrievers.\n\nStill, I hesitate to call him TAH because maybe there\u2019s another big gift to go with it all, or maybe he\u2019s just bad at it. \n\nI feel like you should just roll with it though. He got you some cute stuff he probably thought you\u2019d like. Maybe he did forget, maybe he didn\u2019t think on it very hard. On balance, maybe that\u2019s all okay - you know him better than I do, so your call.", "NTA\n\ngifts given with 1/2 ass effort suck almost as much as no gift... like, couldn't he even make a run to Bath & Body Works?\n\nalso, most folks should know to give a spouse a heads up NOT to look at Amazon shared accounts around birthdays/gift giving time.", "So stop getting him thoughtful gifts. Put in the amount of effort he does.", "well op if your so upset about this then cancel the dinner so your not embarrassed and when ur done that u can have a sit down with him or you can tell him in future not to bother buying you a gift.  \n\nat least he managed to get u something which is more than alot get.  however it just might be there is a taste level difference or you have more time to be thoughtful on his gift and he doesnt have the time.", "YTA. Even if you put that much thought into gifts, the fact of the matter is that a lot of people don\u2019t. It\u2019s often not because they don\u2019t care, but because gift giving isn\u2019t their love language/as important to them.", "NTA - Did you cancel the order? I would've.", "NTA - he\u2019s put no effort into your gifts. He probably literally typed in \u201cGolden Retriever gifts\u201d into Amazon and got the first half a dozen things. You do need to talk to him about it though. Smile when you open them and when you\u2019re alone ask if it\u2019s okay if you return a few things as you won\u2019t use them and use the money to get some things you need. Possibly remind him that you did mention them beforehand. I have to say, I\u2019ve been married for over 10 years now and have had many situations like this and now tell my husband exactly what I want. Tonight I put what I wanted for Xmas in my cart and just passed him my laptop to pay. After being in your position several times and being upset that I organise everything for everyone\u2019s birthdays, Christmas, holidays etc and no-one puts any effort into anything for me, I just plan my own birthday too. Does he put effort into other people\u2019s birthdays? Because if he does, he\u2019s being an AH, but if he doesn\u2019t, it just might not be a big deal to him and that\u2019s not going to change overnight.", "YTA - first of all, you kinda invesated a lot of energy into finding out what he bought you even if the start happewned by accident. But after that, you looked for every single item in detail.\n\nIt seems like you dont have trust into your husband. Instead of letting him surprise you and maybe discuss the things with him afterwards, you are immediately raging over those presents before you even got them. You dont give him a chance at all and you dont know what his thoughts are", "NTA. You\u2019ve been telling him what you do want, and what you don\u2019t want (the earrings because you wouldn\u2019t wear them). He looked around, saw you have a lot of blankets and golden retrieve stuff and thought, \u201cbrilliant, I\u2019ll get her this cause she obviously likes these two things.\u201d\n\nit\u2019s okay to be upset. Return it for what you do want.", "YTA. Dude he did put effort. Maybe try appreciating what he got you rather than whining about what he didn\u2019t get you. Oh and be greatful that you have a partner that cares about you", "NTA and my old age thingie tells me you to ask if you are my ex wife, as I believe you may have just won \"points\" in the long-term relationship \"argument bingo\". If I am correct this is a \"high-value\" set of points because it is a \"birthday\" and so these points are set to \"never expire\".\n\nSo - happy birthday - and now you can smile on your birthday knowing you've got that one in the bank for your future with the S.O..", "YTA for getting mad about something that hasn't even happened yet. You don't know if those items are a silly side gift. You don't know if there's something else he might be getting you. If tomorrow comes and goes and there's nothing else, then be upset, but what's the point in being worked up ahead of time?", "YTA and a brat. You could have gotten nothing and honestly you probably should have gotten nothing. Be thankful he even thought about you enough to get you something.", "YTA. Respectfully, it sounds like you\u2019re being picky. Yeah, you gave him ideas on what you actually wanted. But everything he has bought you does sound like it was thoughtful to at least some degree. He\u2019s buying things based on your interests and likes. Not really understanding whether you need it or will use it for sure doesn\u2019t mean he doesn\u2019t love or appreciate you. Just maybe he\u2019s a bit oblivious. \n\nSome people just suck at buying gifts for people, but I think he\u2019s trying based on what you\u2019ve said. Also, most men are shit at picking up hints. He may have not gotten the things you hinted at because he didn\u2019t know exactly which brands, types, sizes, or styles to get. He may have chosen to play it safe with the things he got, thinking they were a safer choice. \n\nThe shirt not being your style doesn\u2019t necessarily mean he\u2019s thoughtless. It\u2019s really hard to buy clothes for people. Shirts tend to be the easiest but it can still be hard to nail someone\u2019s style. \n\nI\u2019ve failed several times with this for my husband so now I just avoid clothes lol. His response was just to laugh good-naturedly and thank me anyway. We used the shirt for painting and then later as a rag before throwing it out. Oh well, lesson learned. He didn\u2019t look the gift horse in the mouth, though and I really appreciated that. Be happy he\u2019s buying you things for you and not just things he likes thinking you will too. This is common and pretty thoughtless. So there\u2019s that at least.\n\nFood for thought.", "NTA. Go out before dinner and buy yourself something you want, a nice something, and wrap it and bring it to the party and give a gift to yourself.  If you want to be nice and not embarrass your husband, put his name on it like he bought it for you.  If you do decide to put his name on it, make sure it is something really, really nice.  Happy birthday!", "NTA- you have the right to be disappointed and I would be too. You need to be gracious and smile when opening the gifts and say in a charming way something like, oh wow thank you sweetheart this is great. Now I won\u2019t need anymore golden retriever stuff. I\u2019ve got everything I need. Put the calendar in the kitchen, sticker in the junk drawer and wear the T-shirt as a sleep shirt and go buy yourself a present. Dude- he took time IN ADVANCE to order something. \n\nLol just be thankful he didn\u2019t spend a lot of money on a bad gift. Now that would be a problem. Just sit in your feels for an hour and then get over it. Amazon wishlist is a good idea, too.", "NTA for being upset but I think you might be TA for acting upset. I\u2019m not trying to be a lame husband apologist here, but it does seem like he\u2019s trying to get you things you might like. Also, final judgment on him will have to wait until we see if he got anything you hinted about. Maybe he also got something not off Amazon so you don\u2019t know about that. \n\nAs far as ordering things last minute, that\u2019s just the way things go sometimes in this Amazon reality we live in. We are 2 weeks out from Christmas and I haven\u2019t even started shopping. I love and appreciate my kids and my other family more than I can express. Getting presents last minute doesn\u2019t negate that.", "NTA.  I know people will say you shouldn't be disappointed, it's the thought that counts, yada yada.  I wonder how those people would react to their partner getting them such useless gifts.  Would they just take it and not be unhappy?  I rather have my husband not get me anything than things that aren't my type or extremely childish.  For the thought to count, the person actually has to put some thought into it.\n\nYour spouse is the one person who should know you better than anyone.  It's insulting to you.  And men are perfectly capable of picking out great, thoughtful gifts for their wives.  All the men I know are able to do just that.  When you open your presents in front of everyone, you're going to feel embarrassed.  I suggest talking to him before you meet up with friends.  Tell him you saw what he ordered, ask him if that's your bday present.  If that's all he got, tell him the presents aren't your type and you will order something for yourself.  It's better to be direct with him before you're in front of others.  Be nice, but very direct.\n\nPersonally, I just straight up tell my husband some options I would like for my bday then he picks one or two.  Some people cannot pick up on hints (myself included).  For next year, just be direct and tell him some things you would like.  If he still doesn't do it, then stop doing so much as well.", "YTA be thankful you have a spouse and that he even got you a gift at all some people don\u2019t have that", "ESH. I HAAATE it when people hint and don't straight up tell me what they want.  Still, dude, you could have made more of an effort than that. \n\nI know what I'm getting for Christmas/my birthday already.

My husband thinks exactly the same way. \u201cShe has a lot of sth -> she likes it -> I\u2019ll get her more\u201d. I had to explain to him that it is not always the case. And I began writing a wish list (and sharing with him) - with items of different value, so that he can choose what fits his budget, and with direct links where to buy. Sometimes people are just this way (and I find it both funny and annoying at the same time)", "Be grateful for a partner who doesn\u2019t put any real thought into what he gets her? He got her stuff at the last possible minute, and he didn\u2019t listen when she tried to tell him about the things she liked/needed. Out of EVERYTHING she told her husband, he only heard \u201cGolden Retriever\u201d, and just got her G.R. related stuff. He did he absolutely MINIMUM. There is nothing wrong with her wanting him to put the same thought and effort into her birthday as she does to his.", "Wow. You might want to look into therapy.", "I would rather have nothing than things I will never use.", "Also, I don't think using Amazon means he's lazy. You can get everything there. \n\nAnd being upset its showing up the day before your birthday sounds picky too. It's still going to be there before. \n\nI dont see the problem with either of these.", "Nah, women need to stop being grateful for mediocrity", "Wow the bar is loooooooow!  Fkn hell Hahahha", "The bar is in hell at this point and even that\u2019s too high\n\nETA: OP is NTA.

Part of giving a gift is about the giver even though it really shouldn\u2019t it\u2019s about the receiver. So a simple fix would be to see if he thinks it would be fun from now on to get a \u201ccouple\u2019s\u201d gift like putting money away for a trip or get a dinner together out or a night away for a concert - something you can enjoy together instead of doing individual gifts. My husband and I don\u2019t spend a lot on \u201cfrivolous\u201d things so if one of us wants something it doesn\u2019t need to be a special occasion we\u2019ll just get it if we want it (within reason). This has saved so much time and unnecessary angst. We still get each other little surprises like flowers or candy or beer/alcohol with a note but for the big events, it\u2019s always a gift for us to enjoy together and honestly it\u2019s more fun to me than any sweater, shoes or blanket he would have gotten me. Moments are forever.", "Do not open gifts in front of people this year. I would just be honest with him. Tell him you received the notification from Amazon and saw what he ordered. And in your kindest, gentlest, politist way possible try to convey that those items are neither appropriate nor wanted.\n\nPersonally, I detest receiving gifts. They cause way too much anxiety.", "I think nta, you are allowed to be upset. I will add though that the gifts you mentioned like perfume, boots, or coat might be difficult for your partner to pick out. I've been with my husband a long time and I don't know if he'd like a coat I picked out", "Definitely feels like a grandma who doesn't know much about the kids.... you mention one time that you like golden retrievers, now THAT'S what they know and that's all they'll buy you forever.", "NAH\n\nHusband loves to get me things he thinks I would like. Sometimes it hits the mark, sometimes not. It's the same from me to him. It depends a lot on what's happening in our lives and our capacity to exert that kind of energy. (We've been together 26 years).  A gift doesn't indicate how we feel about each other. We buy stuff for ourselves that we need and want. The gifts are tokens. Sometimes they go in the give away pile.... and sometimes they grow on me because he knows me so well.", "NTA, but need more details/info.\n\n* First or second offense (or in a relatively recent marriage/relationship): us guys are dumb, and need to be educated why the lack of effort is lazy.

As a woman and wife myself, I cannot for the life of me understand why women give \"hints\" to men. Men are a thick as a rock when it comes to picking hints. They don't get it. Their brain doesn't work that way. Men are more straight forward. If you want something specific then be direct about it. What's this nonsense about dropping hints? You're 36 for Christ's sake! Not a teenager in her first relationship too shy to ask for gifts. \n\nYour husband didn't get you random bs. He actually put some thought into it and got you things he thought you'd like. In his mind you like your golden retriever so you'd obviously like GR themed items. Also, let's not be judgemental about stickers. A lot of people, even 60+ years of age, collect stickers. It's a hobby. It's not just for kids. \n\nIt's okay to be upset about not getting what you want for your birthday but it's not okay to take that hurt out on your significant other, especially when the problem happened because of your lack of communication skills. Your husband is not at fault here. Please be more direct with your wants and desires. Men are not good with deciphering this whole hint bs women tend to do.", "STICKERS!!! LMAO, I'm sorry, but that is the most riculous gift I've heard of for an adult, especially since you've shown no interest in stickers. The gift as a whole isn't great.

I like and love it no matter how stupid it is. This man takes care of me. The gifts don\u2019t matter-washing out a bucket of puke when I\u2019m sick? That matters. Bringing an ice pack for my migraine at 3am? That matters. If he buys me a plastic necklace with my name on it? You bet I\u2019m going to be happy.

Maybe focus on people instead.\n\n>  i pride myself in buying thoughtful gifts for him. It takes me weeks to get his gifts together.\n\nYou do what you enjoy.

I think your husband's gift choices demonstrates that he was trying to please you and I'm going to go against the grain and say that you should go along and be polite when your husband gives you these things. Perhaps there's something else he's planning that isn't coming from Amazon. Perhaps not. But you've got all of this angst about an event that hasn't happened yet and you're judging your husband for trying and not living up to your expectations-- and I'm going to say again that it's not even your birthday yet. If you confront your husband then he's going to know that you checked the notifications to see when he ordered your gifts. He could rightly say that he assumed you wouldn't open the boxes or even check them because -- why would you do that knowing you didn't order anything and the boxes were addressed to him? Maybe he thought you would really appreciate these gifts. In my family this is called \"lighthousing\", giving someone variations on a theme because they said they liked it once.\n\nSometime after your birthday, after you calm down, sit your husband down and let him know how much birthdays mean to you and how you'd like to be celebrated next year. Otherwise, I'm of the mindset that we aren't entitled to gifts and that this level of expectation takes the fun out of it for everyone.\n\nAnd you were a mid-December baby.

Is it possible that some of those other items you requested are going to be under the tree for you (assuming you celebrate Christmas?) \n\nI'm going to say NAH for the moment.", "I kind of think YTA.  At least it's not a candle, the gifts are aligned with your interests, that shows some thought.  He hasn't missed your birthday.  I don't think he's actually done anything wrong here.  Sometimes we don't like what we get as gifts.  Be a grownup and say thank you and buy yourself the crocs.\n\n\nBy the way, most of the stuff you were \"hinting\" at is super difficult to gift to others well.  You wanted him to puck out a black coat for you?  Clothing shopping is so subjective, and sizes range like crazy.", "YTA\n\nSo many things to unpack here. First off, if you know you have a joint account and you know (obviously) your birthday is coming up, you text him and confirm he ordered something, you don't open it up and see what's in the order. I don't buy for a second that you didn't know exactly what you were doing when you opened the notifications. \n\nSecond, stop dropping hints!!!! If you want something, say something. We're not mind readers and it's annoying as all hell when people expect others to read their minds. Shit, you could have literally made a wish list on Amazon and emailed it to him!!!!\n\nThird, how many gifts do you think you deserve?!? Shoes, slippers, perfume, clothes, makeup.... \"Amazon screams I forgot and I'm lazy\"... So what you're saying is that you've never purchased a gift for someone on Amazon?", "YTA, big time.  Spoiled, entitled, immature AH.  And you don't even make sense:\n\n>What was he expecting to do when we got home together and all those packages are there on our front porch?\n\nUh, what normal people fucking do when they order presents for people they live with.  \"That's your present, don't open it. Let me go wrap it.\"  Seeing a fucking *amazon box* isn't spoiling a birthday surprise, ffs.\n\nNot that you actually want a surprise.  Not that you want him to put *his* thoughts into a gift.  You just want him to be your personal shopper.  I mean, if you just asked for cash and bought your own very specific shit, you'd have to *do* something.  But you'd rather he did your errands like a good little butler and calls it a birthday present. \ud83d\ude44", "YTA\n\nHis gifts seem like they're intended to be lighthearted and humorous. Most people would laugh. Given that there will be an audience for the opening of these presents, him going for something funny and non-offensive makes sense. They all know you like golden retrievers. \n\nYOUR list seems like you're using him and your birthday for personal shopping. Did you seriously think he'd gift you a wardrobe of professional clothes? Everything you \"hinted\" for are things which are tricky AF to buy for other people. Would you honestly be ok with any black coat he got? Or any boots/ shirts/ pants he got? I'm thinking not. \n\n**You didn't actually want a gift from him.** You wanted cash to go shopping for yourself. \n\nGiven the high level of extreme pickiness, your outmoded emotional reaction, and your snooping, I am not surprised he took a while to make his choices. I would believe it if he said he expected you to snoop, so he ordered things the day-of to prevent you stewing about things for weeks and trying to get him to return it. \n\nAll in all, you are teaching him that giving you presents is an unpleasant, thankless, chore he gets yelled at for doing. Seriously consider how you would react if he started crying and yelling that you got him shitty gifts and didn't try hard enough. You'd be pissed and never, ever want to buy him another gift in his lifetime. \n\nIf you ever want presents in the future: Laugh and thank him when you open the presents in front of everyone, buy your own damn self new clothes, and give better, actually viable, gift suggestions next time instead of treating him like an Amazon shopping wish list.", "YTA.

Why be so upset before you know?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMight be a good time to have a talk with him about how important gifts are to you, just a thought?

You can\u2019t expect that others will match your energy/show their love in the same way. I love that you put so much thought and every into keeping your gifts thoughtful, but not everyone values endless searching for a super thoughtful gift the same. If you want to do that, it\u2019s amazing, but projecting that everyone *should* match your energy on it is not realistic. \n\n2. If there\u2019s a gift you specifically want, state it clearly.

Overall, NTA... but neither is he.\nSome guys just really, really don't pick up hints. Also, some people were never taught how to give thoughtful gifts. \nI've been upset at my significant other about this type of thing. Ultimately, I set him annual calendar reminders of what I like for gifts & it also says stuff like don't order from our shared accounts, listen for hints, etc. He never bought gifts growing up and I do all the gifts for our kids so..... it makes sense for us. He has direction & I don't get upset.", "NTA.

For me and my husband, it's \"I'd really like earrings for Christmas. Silver studs would be nice.\" And my husband picks something out with those preferences in mind. It's been working for a decade so far, so if you're not being this direct I recommend giving it a try. NTA but you shouldn't freak out at him and let it ruin your whole birthday. That would put you in AH territory.", "NTA.  Of course you have the right to feel upset, but some people just aren't good gifters.  I am, but since I know others aren't I don't compare my thoughtfulness to theirs.  Sounds like he tried in his own way.  His brain is just wired differently", "Does he do anything not gift related that is sweet or awesome?  I'm guessing gift giving is not his \"love language\" and maybe you should take it easy on him.  If he sucks at everything in your relationship, maybe start re-evaluating but if this is the only thing,  tread carefully if you do confront him.\n\nI'm guessing gift giving is part of your love language since you put a lot of effort into thoughtful gifts.  I'm a dude and I suck at gift giving, often forgetting to get gifts until nearly the last minute or after the fact.  I do my best to at least keep up properly for my SO and if it weren't for her reminders I'd forget gifts for half my extended family.\n\nMy love language is more to do things for people than buy them gifts.  My love language with my wife is most expressed in physical intimacy above all else.  I take it easy on my self with sucking at gift giving because I honestly spend more of my free time doing things for my wife than I do for me.  So that is my gift to her.  Huge amounts of my time to projects she wants done.\n\nI was a bit put off by your statement regarding the shirt not even being personalized.  What does being personalized have to do with anything.  Do gifts have to be personalized to be any good?  I'm not sure if you are high maintenance, but to my ears, that sounds high maintenance.\n\nIf it's important to you to get better gifts, bring this up gently.  It will be hurtful to him if he thought he did a really good job and you tell him you don't like them.  I would also point out the thought does count and sometimes it's better to like what you get than to get what you like.  Don't forget to simply be grateful. There could always be a better gift.\n\nAll this said, it does suck to get gifts you don't like and have them feel obligated to pretend that you do like them.  It's still probably best to simply thank him and move on for now.  And then next Christmas and next year be really explicit and obvious about the types of gifts you like to get.\n\nIf you do that, maybe he'll pick up the hint.  But if he doesn't I hope bad gift giving won't be a deal breaker.  Like let's say this guy is seriously awesome but then sucks at gift giving.  Is bad gift giving a good reason to start a confrontation or to cause hurt feelings?  If you think so, you probably have more issues than him.", "Sigh,  I, too, love a man with no gift giving abilities.

Hence it you could be telling that to multiple people and end up with multiple pairs. He went with the stuff you weren\u2019t looking at that he felt you\u2019d enjoy. Like the earrings for example, you mentioned that you liked them and said you wouldn\u2019t wear them much, in his mind he probably felt like you wanted them but just didn\u2019t want to spend the money on them. Everyone loves shirts, you love Golden Retrievers, it goes together. Depending on where you live blankets are good as well. He put thought into it maybe just not effort.

Overall I really can\u2019t blame him for avoiding all of those \u201csuggestions\u201d and going for something different\u2014it\u2019s probably what I would\u2019ve done in his shoes unless I knew very specifically what product you wanted and that you weren\u2019t planning to purchase it yourself.\n\nI think if you only handle this with anger/accuse him of not caring YWBTA, but you definitely should try to work through it constructively so this doesn\u2019t repeat itself in the future.

I\u2019d rather get a gift late than get a gift that\u2019s thoughtless, I\u2019ve both gotten and given late gifts and nobody gives a fuck as long as it\u2019ll come.", "I suppose the issue I take is if OP\u2019s gonna hold it against him then don\u2019t drop hints and solve all the problems. Instead say \u201cthis is what I\u2019d like and nothing else\u201d. Then the timing issue doesn\u2019t matter, the gift is better, hints (which are the second most passive form of communication shortly after sarcasm) don\u2019t have to be missed, and it doesn\u2019t matter that hubby is a bad gift giver comparatively.", "The word is \u201csubtle\u201d. Yw. Some men are terrible gift givers. I read another post today where she got nothing from her husband because once again, he forgot her birthday. Be gracious. If he\u2019s a good partner in other areas cut him some slack in this one. They\u2019re just material things. If it really bothers you though just quietly return stuff later because really, what will be gained by you getting upset?", "I'd love to hear more about this anecdote! What did he think she was giving him and how did he snoop? When and in what circumstances did he throw a fit? Were other people there for a bday party who then witnessed his freak out? Did he actually understand how badly he screwed up by the way he handled it? It sounds like he was an AH the whole time if he was calling her names and freaking out on her. Did he often behave this way? Or was this the first time?\n\nThe story really is a great comparison to OP's situation, because it emphasizes the root issue: how the recipient handles the situation, whether they are rude, mean, or ungrateful, that's what determines who the AH is.  \n\nOP, for example, could be 100% right about everything \u2014 their partner may be half-assing the bday with little regard for what they actually enjoy and would like to receive. But what will determine who the AH is, is how they behave. It's possible to communicate OP's confusion and disappointment without being mean. So long as they communicate openly but with kindness and politeness, OP is NTA.", "Yeah, because gifts that take a lot of work and planning are important to her. \n\nThey're not important to him. If you want to fault the guy for failing to give OP the gift she wants, so be it. But I see posts like this all the time, and it always amounts to people putting their desire for things ahead of the relationships with people.", "They are arriving on my birthday. By 9pm when im going to be having dinner with my friends.", "> If you can\u2019t be picky with your spouse then who the hell can you be picky with.\n\nYour interior decorator?  Your paid party planner? Basically anyone you are paying appropriately to provide you with the service of catering to your whims.\n\nYour partner on the other hand should get consideration and grace.  He bought her a pair of earrings *she was considering herself*.  He could easily have thought that she loved them but thought they weren\u2019t practical.  That isn\u2019t the bare minimum. Thats being picky, and being TA", "Adults aren\u2019t entitled to gifts. We should all be grateful for anything extra we receive. I was taught this was basic manners. You don\u2019t expect and you don\u2019t look a gift horse in the mouth. You say thank you and if you don\u2019t like the gift you donate it, regift, or throw it out. Expecting gifts is one thing, but then getting all pissy when it\u2019s not exactly what you wanted is another. This level of entitlement is why some people give up on gift giving altogether and just say f*ck it. First world problems. \n\nA lot of people celebrate birthdays by going out and doing something fun instead. This doesn\u2019t make them AHoles. Maybe OP\u2019s husband should go this route from now on to avoid being crucified by people for not being a perfect gift giver.", "I'd cancel it. \n\nThank him for thinking of getting something you'd like, but that, he didn't take into account all of the objections you stated above.\n\nThen, in the future, give him an actual list. \n\nI tell my husband exactly what I want, with room for him to \"surprise me\".\n\nThis shouldn't be a huge issue. It's a practical one.\n\nYou don't want to waste money, you don't want to be disappointed,  and you want to be able to treat each other to things on special occasions. \n\nCommunication is key.

They carried a lot of collectibles. I bought myself a figurine of a little girl holding 2 puppies because I love dogs, animals of any kind.

This clearly isn\u2019t his forte. \n\nIt\u2019s the thought that counts. He put in effort from what I can tell and she needs to give him some leniency.
