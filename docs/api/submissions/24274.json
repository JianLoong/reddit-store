Or, if it continues after that, I'd just take your sister/friends/whomever and leave to go somewhere else, she can join you when she's done with her call.  If you're watching a movie with her and she does this, just change the channel and watch something else or go to bed.", "NTA.\n\nPhone rings:  ok to get up and **excuse yourself** to answer it.  If you have company, keep the call short unless it's an emergency.  Call them back.  Pay attention to your company.  \n\nFianc\u00e9e sounds self-centered, inconsiderate, and immature if she's giving you the silent treatment.", "NTA...If she feels the need to take a call, she should at least have enough manners to excuse herself and leave the room.", "NTA I had a roommate who did this (wouldn\u2019t leave the room) and when they wouldn\u2019t change their behavior, I just kept on doing what I was doing. TV volume up loud enough to hear over the talking, etc. It\u2019s a bit more difficult in relationships. Your partner sounds like a child who also has main character syndrome.", "NTA, obviously. what she's doing is ridiculous and rude. \n\nbut you sure did put her on the defensive with how you approached her about it.", "NTA. \n\nSeems like the silent treatment is a nice reprieve from the constant noise you must hear living with her.\n\nIt is one thing to always answer the phone, it is another to not excuse yourself to take the phone call. She needs to be leaving the room when she answers the phone (assuming the call isn't like 30 seconds or less). It is so rude to have a phone conversation while others are in the room already chatting. \n\nSo first, no, you aren't overreacting and you even took her aside to address it privately. Second, stop allowing your time to be wasted. If she answers the phone when you are in the room with people, or just the two of you, leave and go do your own thing in another room. If you are watching a movie, pause it for 5 minutes and if she doesn't get off the phone, put the movie back on, bonus points for raising the volume if she is trying to talk in the same room you are watching TV on. Stop letting her stop everything and take up all the space.", "NTA she should not take calls during 1 on 1 time with you or family unless they are important. It's rude and shows she's bored of y'all.", "NTA at all. She\u2019s being extremely rude to you, to your sister, to your friends. If her conversation is so important that it needs to be had while you\u2019re doing something else she can sure get up and have that conversation elsewhere. But dammit I\u2019d be mad too if I was in the middle of a conversation with anyone (outside of work) and they took a call at all. Unless she\u2019s dealing with an emergency, those calls should wait and she should learn to respect those with whom she\u2019s present.", "NTA\n\nYour wife has a serious issue with manners. This is so incredibly rude to everyone around her and reeks of Main Character syndrome", "I\u2019m not sure how you could stand this long enough to propose to her. \n\nSounds like to me you\u2019d be in the middle of your proposal speech and if she gets a call she\u2019d answer it. \n\nThere is just zero respect for anyone coming from her especially for you. I have no idea how you can put up with that. NTA absolutely.", "NTA\n\nThis is common courtesy. If you want to take a phonecall, leave the room. Sure - unless it's the middle of a meeting or something, then answering, saying hello, then getting up and leaving is OK, but just sitting there talking to someone on your phone and disturbing whatever activity was previously happening in the room is rude.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

That is rude behavior.  Your are being disrespected.\n\nYou have guest over, and she answered the phone and had a conversation in front of you two?  She **needs** to leave the room, then you and your guest (your sister) can continue to talk.  Everyone is put on hold while she has the conversation in front of you.

We'll all be watching TV in the living room and she takes a call and sits on the couch for an hour chatting (i.e. shouting cuz she's been to a lot of concerts and is slightly deaf). She gets pissed if we turn off the TV and start doing other stuff (\"but I was just wrapping up!\") but also gets mad if we shush her or tell her to leave the room (\"this is my house and I can sit where I want!\" or \"I won't even be that long!\").

I've asked family and partners in the past if they don't mind taking calls on speaker if they have to take it in the same room, so i can at least feel like i'm being invited into a conversation rather than forced to endure one i'm excluded from.  \n\n\nThat said, jumping to demanding that someone to change there behavior to accommodate you before just describing how that behavior makes you feel can be an AH move.
