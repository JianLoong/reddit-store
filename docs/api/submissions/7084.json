For the last several months, one of my roommates, who i\u2019ll call V, has been having her mother basically live with us. She is almost always at the house, at least 4-5 days a week. She takes hours in the kitchen cooking, does laundry here, even parks in our driveway. After having to take my laundry to my parents house 20 minutes away several times because I have work clothes that I need washed while her mother is using our washing machine, I have been getting really fed up and feel like this is a total intrusion of our property. On Christmas morning, my one day off to sleep late, she woke me up at 9 am chopping a duck in our kitchen. There have been many examples like this, that have been building up over the last several months.\n\nRecently, I had to basically work 48 hours straight, and was excited to go home and have my girlfriend come over and cook us a meal. I had a ton of laundry to do and bring in from my car. As I get home, I see the mom is parked in the driveway. I bring in all my stuff from street parking to find the mom using our kitchen and washing machine. I see that V is not home, just the mother using our whole house. Fed up, I contacted the landlord. Who said she will talk to V.\n\nTwo days later, I come home to see the mother in our home, while V is not home, using our washing machine again. I decided to watch her exit the house and see that she has a key. I believe this is completely unreasonable and she should only be here as V\u2019s guest, while she is home. I contacted the landlord again to tell him and he said he agreed with me.\n\nLater that night, V and the mother confronted me for speaking to the landlord. She said that the mother cleans the house and is always very sweet to us, which is true. She called me out for not taking the garbage out enough, which is also true, but my justification was, if the mom is living here for free, she can at least do these things. I would be happy to do them if she left. I asked her to tell me how many nights a week her mom sleeps here, and she refused to answer. Her mom admitted to having a key when I said I saw her, and V accused me of basically creepily watching her mother when I said I also watched to see if she was the one doing laundry. They said they are doing V\u2019s laundry, but I see the mom taking loads in and out of her car. They also used the excuse that it is part of their culture several times, which I told them then they should find a place that they can live together where they both pay rent.\n\nI told the mother that she should not have a key to our home and only to come as V\u2019s guest. V firmly believes I am the asshole here, because she says, she pays rent so she can do as she pleases too, but I still feel like this is completely overstepping their boundaries.

She might only rent a room somewhere or might have downsized when V became a tenant in this house because they saw that she could have all these facilities for free. They're totally scamming you, OP.", "I saw some of the actual tribbles at a museum exhibit. They are as cute in real like as they were on screen.", "Oh they do, that's why they've been so KIND to you. So you'd feel bad to bring up any of the issues that you have :P", "that's the key...'occasionally'. V's mom's doing it consistently.", "> My main gripe was the mother having a key, being here while her daughter is not home and using the amenities for herself.\n\nGet with your other roommates.  Whenever anyone finds V's mom in the place without V, kick them out when first found.  If it keeps up, ask the landlord to evict V.", "NTA at all. Next time she\u2019s taking up the machine, take her wet clothes out and take the machine back. You\u2019re paying for the privilege, not her.", "NTA \n\nIf it's acceptable for one, it's acceptable for all - what would V (or V's mummy) do if your family member started taking over the kitchen and washing machine so that V's mother couldn't use them?", "NTA. It's a culture thing. They need to find a place together. If you can't use your own driveway and do laundry somewhere else. You should be getting a discount on rent. V and mom should pay the difference if they stay.", "Nta. One or two nights can let that slide, 4-5 nights all the time unless everyone is ok with it, means pay rent and contribute to the utilities bills or visit 1-2 days a week and do her own laundry in her own house", "NTA no one else besides those on the lease should have a key to your home, unless everyone unanimously agrees it's ok.  Same for her staying there and using your kitchen and laundry, and that would only be acceptable if she were contributing to rent and utilities.", "NTA for speaking up against the mother always being there, but you should have talked to V and the mother first before going to the landlord...", "And TA, but likely she is doing laundry for extra cash on the side. That is why she\u2019s doing laundry so much and loading it into the car. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if you guys are sharing the cost of that with extra electricity and water.", "NTA- I get that people have different relationships and cultural ties around parenthood\u2026 that being said that doesn\u2019t mean they have any right to cause undue stress onto you because of it.  V\u2019s daughter can find a way to accommodate everyone in the house\u2019s needs, or she can get a place where that sort of behavior is acceptable.", "NTA. Only paying residents should have keys and access to laundry.  Their culture is irrelevant, the mother needs to contribute if she's going to spend so much time there.", "NTA\u2026how would V (and your landlord) feel if your girlfriend moved in and monopolized utilities and parking?", "NTA.  Roommate can move in with mom.", "Nta", "NTA - this is intrusive of her to think it is ok for her mother to be there and use the house for whatever she wants, beyond what a temporary visitor would do.", "NTA. V needs to grow up. That's ridiculous.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nDid it ever occur to any of you that what V is doing is putting all of you in danger of being evicted.  \n\nThat her mother can not be living over there, staying there, doing all of those things, as now she could be considered a tenant.  And that could give the landlord a reason to raise the rent or to have notices sent to all of  you to vacate on the grounds of violating the lease.", "NTA, wow! V and her mom are truly dense or just planned to take advantage thinking you wouldn't speak up!", "NTA wtf", "NTA, and I'm not buying that this is something cultural, me thinks they're playing that card in the hopes of people turning the other cheek to their asshole behavior. My advice would be to start shopping around for a new place to live, because this sounds like it's only going to get worse, however if the mom's car is parked in the driveway, call a tow truck company to come tow that shit, or pile her damp laundry on top of the washer if she's hogging it up.", "Seriously! V better start paying for the increase in utilities from her mom always using the laundry machines and in the kitchen", "it's such an asshole thing to do too, did V ask all the roommates first or did it just start happening? She totally needs to be paying more for her mom to be over all the time. Is there a reason that V's mom NEEDS to do laundry here? I assume she lives close by why doesn't V go to her mom's house? If they're seemingly so dependant  on each other why did she move out at all? Why did she decide to live somewhere with roommates assuming she knew her mom would be over several times a week? \n\nThis is all so weird and completely not ok NTA, most people would do the same thing", "Exactly. They pay rent and bills instead of living with mum and get stuck with another's mom? I would have matched her out the door.", "V's mom is clocking up bills at their house so she doesn't have to pay for the energy costs.", "That\u2019s very weird actually. If it\u2019s that often.. okay maybe I\u2019ve been watching too many movies but could she be washing money xD ahaha", "Honestly the only culture I could imagine going softly in that direction would be Balkan. \n\nI don't mean this to be racist, it's just that people in Balkan countries tend to have way closer relationships with their parents/family than we have in western countries.", "They all pay rent. For their share. V's mom is freeloading and it is sickening she would do that to young adults based on her age....", "Yeah V pays rent. V's mom doesn't.", "They clearly had no interest in fixing the situation when confronted with it so honestly I get why she didn't want the drama and went to the landlord. Op shouldn't have had to explain that when you move out your parents don't move with you. Otherwise why move out?", "The amount of laundry youre describing makes me thing she's doing it for money on the side. This is not reasonable and she needs to be only allowed in if her daughter is home.\n\nNTA", "That is insane. When my housemate did that (not with a parent) I got rid of them.", "Shit! I didn\u2019t think of that!  Also the cost of the water bill\u2026..", "That\u2019s what I\u2019m thinking.", "Maybe she manages air bnbs.", "About the dryer: check the exterior vent for it, if you can find it.  I once rented a house that came with a washer and dryer, and the dryer took an eternity to get things dry.  After a few months, we discovered that was because the vent was packed with lint, and probably used by a rodent as a nest at one point.  It was so clogged, that the moist air couldn't vent, so it just sat in the dryer.  Once we cleared it, it worked like a dream.", "Why is OP complaining about the mother being there all the time running up their bills and taking over the house; she's really no tribble at all! NTA.", "Great reference to a great episode and a great example", "Always liked \"The Trouble with Tribbles\" from Star Trek TOS. Loved how DS9 revisited that episode.", "I think V is doing her own washing as well to 'save' on bills. That is waaay too much washing for just the housemate.", "Maybe she airbnb's her own place, which would explain rarely sleeping there, and washing lots of linens.", "And then there's an update in DS9, where they go back in time to that episode. Crew gets all dressed up in the original uniforms and they FX a bunch of the original footage into a DS9 story.\n\nTrials and Tribble-ations.", "I got to see a live outdoor performance of that episode complete stuffed tribbles as a part of the \"Trek in the Park\" production in Portland years ago.  It was a blast!", "People who take advantage ALWAYS know what they are doing. If they didn't they would be stressing themselves instead of others. That's the difference between decent people and the selfish lot. \n\nYou are being conned. You didn't agree to rent and bills for an extra adult. Think of it that way. So what if they offer food a few times? Does that cover the cost of rent and bills for another person?", "An ex-housemate had everyone over. Then I discovered they were there when she was at work! All day and all night. I told her I'm the owner of the house and don't do that so she needs to nip it in the bud (she initially claimed she never does that). As usual, I was away for the weekend. She knew I came back on a Sunday evening and messaged me saying her ex was at the house and she was at work. I told her he better be out of the house by the time I get back (I had to leave my friend's house early). She said 'he doesn't have any money do you expect him to walk into town?' (he'd travelled from far away but didn't have less than \u00a32 supposedly). I said if he was there when I got home I am calling the police.\n\nShe left after that so I didn't have to boot her out. She conned me out of the rent though.", "Talk again to the landlord. 4-5 days is not OK (in V\u2019s words, it isn\u2019t reasonable).", "Such a great DS9 episode.", "Unless she\u2019s feeding everyone and doing everyone\u2019s laundry,/chores then absolutely not ok. Especially since she\u2019s doing outside laundry (probably a side hustle)", "I didnt find out until like 20y later but I guess it was a \"twin\" episode to that Voyager where Tuvok remembers he was in Star Trek VI on Sulu's ship. And they had Takei in to do a whole episode. Some anniversary celebration/promotion or something."]}
