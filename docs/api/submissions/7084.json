For the last several months, one of my roommates, who i\u2019ll call V, has been having her mother basically live with us. She is almost always at the house, at least 4-5 days a week. She takes hours in the kitchen cooking, does laundry here, even parks in our driveway. After having to take my laundry to my parents house 20 minutes away several times because I have work clothes that I need washed while her mother is using our washing machine, I have been getting really fed up and feel like this is a total intrusion of our property. On Christmas morning, my one day off to sleep late, she woke me up at 9 am chopping a duck in our kitchen. There have been many examples like this, that have been building up over the last several months.\n\nRecently, I had to basically work 48 hours straight, and was excited to go home and have my girlfriend come over and cook us a meal. I had a ton of laundry to do and bring in from my car. As I get home, I see the mom is parked in the driveway. I bring in all my stuff from street parking to find the mom using our kitchen and washing machine. I see that V is not home, just the mother using our whole house. Fed up, I contacted the landlord. Who said she will talk to V.\n\nTwo days later, I come home to see the mother in our home, while V is not home, using our washing machine again. I decided to watch her exit the house and see that she has a key. I believe this is completely unreasonable and she should only be here as V\u2019s guest, while she is home. I contacted the landlord again to tell him and he said he agreed with me.\n\nLater that night, V and the mother confronted me for speaking to the landlord. She said that the mother cleans the house and is always very sweet to us, which is true. She called me out for not taking the garbage out enough, which is also true, but my justification was, if the mom is living here for free, she can at least do these things. I would be happy to do them if she left. I asked her to tell me how many nights a week her mom sleeps here, and she refused to answer. Her mom admitted to having a key when I said I saw her, and V accused me of basically creepily watching her mother when I said I also watched to see if she was the one doing laundry. They said they are doing V\u2019s laundry, but I see the mom taking loads in and out of her car. They also used the excuse that it is part of their culture several times, which I told them then they should find a place that they can live together where they both pay rent.\n\nI told the mother that she should not have a key to our home and only to come as V\u2019s guest. V firmly believes I am the asshole here, because she says, she pays rent so she can do as she pleases too, but I still feel like this is completely overstepping their boundaries.

With having your other roommates in agreement, it might help to resolve this. If that doesn't work, talk to your landlord again, and maybe get your other roommates to join you. Good luck OP.", "NTA. Not what you signed up for. She isn't on the lease. It is reasonable to set that boundary. Legally she should not have a key or be using your parking spaces.

But it also means you don't get to have things 100% your way. You have to compromise. So no, she can't just have someone else over as often as she wants.
