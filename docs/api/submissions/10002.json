You are judging based on what you have heard from others and not from how she has treated you or your child.

Tangential to that though - I just learned that Stockholm Syndrome is named after a kidnapping in Stockholm where police negligence endangered the lives of the victims more than the kidnappers ever did, so the actual events are the exact reverse of common meaning of the term.

Now that I know it upsets MIL, I'm questioning my stance. Perhaps answering her calls occasionally just to thank her for the baby gifts wouldn't hurt, but I'll have to be vigilant about where the conversation goes.", "Absolutely. Her husband is fielding the calls and thank yous and it should stay that way.  It sounds like it is well handled, and the only issue is GMIL complaining to MIL. Which will never end or be placated. If husband gets tired and doesn't want to do it anymore that's ok too, but it's not on OP.", "You mean if she actually told the truth about the reason for her behavior", "This is the answer. Vigilant courtesy.  Good luck!", "Totally fair. It's never easy, because you don't want to seem like you don't believe what your family is saying about her, and you don't want to wait until after she's hurt your family to take protective measures.\n\nI don't think you've been TA up to this point btw. You've been in an awkward situation and trying to do what's best given what you know.", "Yes, if she told the truth to GMIL she would be betraying her MIL confidence. The only thing that would do would create more family drama than she\u2019s already working with. Not only would she have a manipulative GMIL to deal with, she\u2019d have to deal with her MIL feeling like she can\u2019t tell her anything. \n\nWe are not obligated to build and foster relationships with people we don\u2019t want to. People that try to push that are AH. OP doesn\u2019t want in the middle of family drama so they\u2019re cutting off the person that seems to be the main source. There is nothing wrong with that.", "So everyone should lie for her instead.", "Did she ask them to lie? More than likely not. If they want to tell GMIL, that\u2019s their prerogative. If they aren\u2019t telling GMIL why she doesn\u2019t answer calls/texts, they are the ones that are lying. And again, they\u2019re probably lying to avoid drama, which is probably exactly what GMIL would do.\n\nBut personally avoiding someone because you don\u2019t want to get caught in the middle of drama/want anything to do with them is completely fine. No matter who they are. We are no obligated to like people just because their family or in-laws.", "NTA. As others have said you\u2019ve found a healthy boundary. Your MIL is unable to do that, that\u2019s her deal. She can\u2019t project that onto you.", "NTA. You do whatever you need to do to survive around this bunch.", "NTA just because she doesn\u2019t mind being her mothers victim doesn\u2019t mean you should be! Her grandson thanks her that\u2019s plenty!", "Nta - you just successfully cut off the generational trauma your GMIL wants to continue. Good job for recognizing this and putting a stop to it! She can't continue this with your kid now! \n\nLet MIL know that it stopped with her, you are not willing to put yourself or child thru the nonsense she went thru! And she should probably get some therapy so she doesn't continue it with your kid.", "NTA.  Just say to mil you'll try your best.", "NTA.  MIL is engaging in the same tactics GMIL used when MIL was a child, wanting you to entertain GMIL so she doesn't have to.  It's her decision not to cut GMIL off.  She doesn't get to decide your boundaries.", "Be like FIL", "Also that OP needs to be nicer to GMIL, but GMIL doesn\u2019t need to be nicer to OP. Why would you be nice to someone who isn\u2019t to you. NTA", "Thank you.\n\nOP, my sibling complained about me to their new partner and about their new partner to me when they were frustrated by either of us.  The problem is they never included the positive things because those were obvious right.  When we meet, we had preconceived ideas about each other and those ideas took years to undo after they got married.\n\nLike PartyOn person above, I can't judge this, although I suspect FIL's response and husband not saying anything means that MIL is (mostly) telling the truth.\n\nFamily dynamics are complicated OP.  Basically your MIL will complain to you how GMIL is treating her and then complain about how you are treating GMIL.  You can't really win here.  Just be polite and don't give your GMIL an opening.", "Exactly \n\nThe old saying \u201cthere is three sides to every story! Theirs! Yours! And the Truth\u201d", "NTA. \n\nkeep doing what your doing, if you give in to your mils demands then grandma will just turn her abusive attention onto you and baby and start abusing you two. Its way better to keep her at a distance, to ensure she doesn't abuse you or baby like she's done to mil. \n\nIf anything, suggest helping mil create distance from her mother to help her, emotionally and mentally.", "Right? No reason for OP to get sucked into MIL\u2019s crappy family dynamic. Stay strong, stay silent!", "Respectfully, no. MIL is not placing a vulnerable child in harm\u2019s way to escape GMIL\u2019s wrath. Sure, she\u2019s attempting self-preservation in asking OP to engage\n\nBut to suggest these 2 things are the same tactics? No. MIL is wrong to ask OP to keep the peace but she is not willfully placing her in harm\u2019s way. She isn\u2019t speaking badly of OP to take the heat off her. It\u2019s not the same.\n\nI get your sentiment but to compare MIL\u2019s request to the abuse she suffered as a child,\u2026 no. \n\nTo be clear OP is right to maintain this boundary", "Especially since it\u2019s his grandmother.  Each person responsible for their side of the family. The wife being the default secretary is so pass\u00e9."]}
