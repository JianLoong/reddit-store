Your actions were childish and disrespectful. You threw out something she paid for. How you felt about it was irrelevant.

It's just that simple.", "I've been a vegetarian for longer than you've been alive and I'm voting YTA.\n\nKeep your hands off other people's stuff. They teach this in preschool. You're an adult.", "You are the asshole because at the end of the day you wasted her money for moral reasons, which are subjective. The food product already exists. By throwing it away you are doing nothing to prevent the animal's suffering. I understand and share your moral concerns, but one could argue that the animal has suffered for no reason now.  \nMoving forward you need to come up with a better game plan to deal with disagreements. If you guys live together try asking her to not bring it into the home and to only eat it at restaurants. But if she says no you need to decide if this deal-breaker, because throwing away her stuff is petty and wasteful.", "YTA\n\nNo matter how you spin it you\u2019ll still come out as TA. It\u2019s like a vegetarian throwing away someone\u2019s steak or a steak eater throwing away someone\u2019s salad. \n\nYou\u2019re not god, get over yourself.", "YTA. It wasn't yours too throw away, and I cannot imagine that you made it easier to listen to your opinion by doing so.", "YTA\n\nHow would you like it if she threw stuff out that you like?

I\u2019d argue that since the animal is dead, it\u2019s best honored by USING the product.\n\nI\u2019m also not inherently opposed to any food(I raise and butcher my own), but have you seen how laying hens are treated at commercial farms? Why don\u2019t you point your outrage in that direct.", "YTA, you can feel however you want about foie gras, but you can\u2019t force your feelings about anything on anyone else. This is no different from any story on this sub where a vegetarian ransacks someone\u2019s kitchen and throws out all their meat, the bottom line is that it\u2019s theft and the offender can get off their high horse. I don\u2019t love the idea of foie gras either, but I still think you should apologize and consider reimbursing her or replacing it yourself", "You should feel bad because YTA.

This was a controlling move on your part and tbh -a bullshit move. She is absolutely right to call you hypocritical.

Nobody deserves to be treated like that.", "YTA we can't unilateral decision because you don't like the way something is done especially when you yourself ( possibly) eat meat . Agreed the way foie gras is donne is questionable but at the end it's not your decision to make \n\nI suggest you go back buy some in order to avoid the chaos that is about to occur", "YTA\n\n\nIt wasn't yours. You stole your gf's property to deliberately waste it. Of course you're the AH. \n\n\nTrying to control people is also entirely uncool. \n\n\nExpress an opinion by all means. Then leave it. You do not have the right to control anyone else.\n\n\nETA also pay your gf back for the money she spent", "YTA pay her back and apologize. You ARE being hypocritical and it is OBVIOUSLY her choice on what she can eat. The meat industry is incredibly messed up as a whole because capitalistic intentions WHATEVER YOU GET IT. One is not worse than the other!! And trust me, the chicken farming in America? They are pumped FULL of so many hormones they are practically crushed to death from their own body. Oh and eating meat isn\u2019t bad and is a sacred part to a lot of cultures when practiced ethically (white vegans take that as you will but take into account my family is indigenous and hunting is a part of our survival!) ANYWAYS two sides to one coin yada yada PAY HER BACK FOR THE FOIE GRAS SERIOUSLY you reacted to having your ego bruised so you tried to prove your point through actions that you knew would get a reaction. Did this even help the situation? Second of all, would your gf criticize you the same way you criticized her? \nSorry for the long winded comment with a passionate rant about the food industry.

Then stop playing the pain olympics between different animals and do something about your feelings - become vegan and dont wear or use leather etc. Otherwise get of your high horse.", "Yta don\u2019t force your opinion on others, throwing her stuff is disrespectful. How would you react if she threw your stuff away?", "Yta thats your opinion, in her culture its a delicacy. Be respectful to others culture esp a so", "Yta. She paid for it and it cost a lot of money. If you don\u2019t like it don\u2019t think about it don\u2019t look at it and don\u2019t eat it.

Also read a book\u2014 factory farming in America is horribly, nauseatingly abusive to the animal, the people processing meat, and the environment. You have absolutely 0 moral ground here.", "YTA. And she\u2019s right, meat farms are really no better. Do you think farm animals are out there thinking \u201cthank god I\u2019m dying slowly in a small cramped stinky cage instead of being force fed to death\u201d? Any feelings of moral superiority is just hypocritical", "YTA. You should talk with her like an adult and if this is something she won't change and you can't deal with, you should just break up with her instead of cowardly throwing it away when she isn't around. \n\nAlso throwing it away did nothing. The bird is already dead. In fact now she will probably end up buying another animal product to replace the one you threw away, so nice job on causing some more animal cruelty.", "YTA - not yours to throw away and not your $$ that bought it.  That shit isn't cheap.  I understand (and agree) that torturing animals should not be acceptable, but that's why YOU have the right not to spend YOUR money on it.  You do not have the right to throw away someone else's poor choices.", "YTA and a hypocritical one to boot", "YTA.  Your beliefs and values do not trump the beliefs and values of others.  If you have a problem with foie gras then you have have every right to refrain from buying and consuming it.

I hope you come home to find she's discarded every single item you own that contains animal byproducts (bye bye shoes, make up and many appliances) as well as anything produced with child and/or slave labor, which should effectively empty your closet.

You achieved nothing while causing conflict.", "God damn this is so typical that it's almost funny. \n\nYou don't have any right to dictate what other people eat, much less toss out things they already acquired with their own money.

After all tossing it away was your decision, you should take responsibility for it. \n\nYTA.", "YTA and if you think the American factory farming system is any better than you\u2019re absolutely clueless. Leave her damn food alone and stop being a hypocrite", "YTA\n\nDo you eat chicken? Because I promise every single one is tortured. Drink milk? That was created by cows that spend their lives constantly pregnant. Get off your high horse OP before your gf leaves you", "I'm french so I'm biased but I agree with your gf, if you're a meat eater, you're no better especially when it's something that you eat once a year. Also, a relationship is also seeing the big picture so let it slide.", "Yta and controlling behavior", "YTA. I\u2019m French and I\u2019d be pissed if my partner did that to me. At the very minimum I would want to be refunded for the price of what has been thrown away, but I\u2019d still probably hold a grudge for a while.", "YTA. The animal already died for it so now you completely wasted food and money.", "YTA, you wasted that animals life and now your gf will prolly go buy a second one if she was looking forward to it that much.", "YTA and a huge hypocrite.

No. Then hands off.", "YTA Did you think that by throwing the foie gras away that duck would miraculously not be dead or have been force fed? You don't get to demand that she thinks the way you do. No, I don't eat it, but I also don't throw it away if they do. Clearly, you think your culture is more morally pure than hers, congratulations AH", "YTA. She wasn't asking you to eat it.

But usually what happens is this:\n- You need to renew your stock of female chickens quite regularly because after two years a chicken will not produce as many eggs.\n- You either reproduce your own chickens or you buy new chickens that will produce your eggs. But the en result is the same.\n- The person who reproduces the chicken this time makes fertilised eggs by having selected male and female chickens interact.\n- There is no current method that does not damage the egg allowing to determine the sex of the future chick (although researchers are working on that)\n- The chicks are born, they select females from males. Females will grow up and maybe be sold, in all cases will have economic value because they will make eggs. Male chicks have no economic value, we don't know what to do with them so they're just cost to avoid, and they kill them as early as they can the way you can see on the internet which is very cruel.\n\nThe reason we don't make meat of those males is because they are not the same kind of chicken. There are breeds that were genetically selected to produce meat, in which both sexes can be used, and are not very proficient in making eggs at an industrial rate. And then there are genetically selected breeds for egg production, in which only females are useful and we only keep male reproducers because they would not make good meat.

Foie gras is just gross", "This is not all the way true. While most farms have mostly female chickens most egg production farms keep a few roosters around because having a rooster near hens keeps egg production higher. Also in the large set ups those flocks are as closed as you can get, which means they very very rarely bring in outside birds (really only if they notice issues that are connected to inbred coefficient depression). So these farms have to have a way of producing birds to replace old laying birds. Males can easily be sold to outside hatcheries or used in meat production (typically dog food since they don't grow as fast) or humanely killed for reptile food (chicks have to come from somewhere, but with the different sizes they have to grow a bit first).\n\nAlso dairy cow males are not killed at birth. Most are castrated and raised up as steers for ground beef or again kibble for meat eating animals, but others are kept in tact and sold to bull farms who help provide the seman to dairy farmers. And at this point most seman is sexed, so bulls are typically born when you aim for them (ie if you have an amazing milk cow you may opt to have her give birth to a bull to sell to the farm you buy seman from so you can spread her genetics around, especially if you are already keeping a daughter. Or if you know the baby you are breeding for will not replace an animal in your herd you could breed for a male to try and get a higher weight animal by slaughter time)", "...
