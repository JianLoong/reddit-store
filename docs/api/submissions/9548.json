{"id": 9548, "submission_id": "10xywtv", "title": "AITA for not giving my adopted daughter a down payment and a car after she already has both of these.", "selftext": "I (52M) have a wife (46F), daughter Emily (29F) and two sons (18M and 16M). We adopted our daughter when she was 12 so we have not known her as long as my sons. We operate a small grocery store in the area and our finances are relatively OK.\n\nWhen my daughter turned 18, we offered her to keep staying with us and help out with the store but she did not want to do that and chose to go to college out of state. I can understand as it was a prestigious school. We did not pay for her education but she never asked and seemed to manage fine, I think she got some grants but also took some loans which I assume were forgiven or paid off.\n\nI do not know her finances but she seems to be doing well, she has worked for many large tech companies, recently got a nice house (not super large but very modern and new), drives a nice car and dresses really fashionably. She has no partner and kids so i assume she can save a lot. We have always been on good terms.\n\nI bought my elder son a car when he was 17, plan to do the same for my younger son, and help them both out to get a start in life by paying their college and giving them a down payment for a house each.\n\nMy daughter never complained about not getting these and she had a good childhood since we adopted her and a nice house to live in. Recently she learned of our intention to give my elder son a down payment when he finishes college and ever since while we still see her and even go to her place, my wife and I feel like she is acting curt towards us so I feel there might be some resentment. But I do not see how I could really help her since she already has these things, does not plan to have kids unlike my sons, and is much more likely to earn more from her major than my sons (unless they take over our store someday). Obviously our bond is a little different since she was adopted as an older child but we still love her like our own.\n\nAITA\n\nEdit: No need to flame me. We just did not think of these things as she was already an adult when we made these decisions. I will talk to my wife and consider talking to my daughter about helping her with her mortgage. My daughter and us do really get along well and I am proud of her, she is a smart woman, went to a prestigious school and got a perfect GPA there and has an excellent job. My sons also had the option of running the store but she is the one who got us considering college and I had not realized how much more it costs now than in my time.\n\nBack when my daughter was 18 we could not afford offering a down payment for every child, but college and a car would have been possible. My daughter was allowed to use our extra cars but did not get a new one.", "created_utc": 1675959935, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10xywtv/aita_for_not_giving_my_adopted_daughter_a_down/", "score": 1281, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You adopted her. Why did you choose to bring her into your family if you were going to give her less than you do your other children.\n\nYou say you gave her a nice life. That's good. Why are you giving your other children a nice life AND financial support?", "YTA. You clearly don\u2019t view her as your daughter. It\u2019s very telling that you refer to her as your adopted daughter but you refer to your bio kids as your sons. Plus you claim that you don\u2019t know her as long as you have known your sons but that\u2019s not true. She\u2019s 29 and you adopted her at 12 which means you\u2019ve known her for 17 years. Your youngest son is only 16. You did nothing to help your daughter get settled into her adult life and here you are doing the opposite for your sons. Of course she would be angry. You\u2019re clearly one of those adoptive parents who think that their adopted child should be happy with whatever they get because you did her a favor by taking her in.", "YTA, sorry.\n\nMy parents sat me down and told me they could not help me with college or even trade school after high school and to figure it out on my own.  So be it.  I worked my ass off, got a full academic scholarship, and have been independent since I was 18.\n\nMy sister got her college paid for, after dropping out twice, a month long trip to Europe, a new car, etc, etc, etc.\n\nYou think I'm not resentful nearly 30 years later?\n\n\"but we still love her like our own.\"\n\nSigns point to bullshit.\n\nEdit: Thank you for the award!", "I want to get in on this before OP deletes it.\n\nYTA. 100%\n\nFirstly, you have adopted this child. That is you child. Doesn\u2019t matter if your sons have been in your life longer. Hell, she has been your child for about 17 years. Older than one of your sons and a year less than the other. Hell, you have 0 excuse as to why you are not closer to the daughter. You had 17 years for complete sentences to get to know her. The first 2 with your sons were babble and gibberish. \n\nSecondly, did the sons ask for the help you are giving them? If not, YTAx2. How dare you treat your children unfairly!? How dare you not provide the same help across the board!? How dare you try to make her the bad guy!?\n\nThirdly, even if she doesn\u2019t need the help, it would be nice. To not have to struggle or hustle is nice. To have a rainy day fund is nice. To just have the same help your siblings get would be nice. But no. You don\u2019t think she should.\n\nAnd, lastly, just because she isn\u2019t married or want kids doesn\u2019t make her less of a person or less deserving of help. Those are choices people make. She could adopt like you did. Or maybe, just maybe, she want to be happy and live life for herself. \n\nOP. I think you need to speak with a therapist that specializes in families like yours. Idk if you are doing it on purpose, but you are drawing a line of who your true family is. And it\u2019s becoming more and more clear. I would be upset if this was happening to me. \n\nYTA.", "YTA. Can you not see the disparity in saying your sons you will buy them cars, pay for college AND a house down payment? You also make alot of assumptions about your daughter. Assuming she did fine in college monetarily, assuming she has no loans. You should have a discussion with her. She may have a ton of debt and could use help. This is fixable. You should not do those things for your sons if you have no intention of not doing them for your daughter. You could contribute to her retirement etc to make things more equal. It makes zero sense to say you love her like your own while your own are getting completely different and preferential treatment. You need to take a good look in the mirror and see what you are doing here.", "Wait, you adopted her when she was 12, she\u2019s now 29, which means you\u2019ve literally known her longer than your youngest son and just a year off your oldest. \n\nYTA, if this is how you talk about her to strangers, it\u2019s no wonder she never brought up money with you guys.  \n\nHow do you not know how your daughter afforded to go to college? You assume she got grants and loans, she was 18 how would she have been doing all of that behind your back without even talking about it? \n\nNot even bringing it up in a conversational way, \u201cHey mom, dad, I\u2019m going to college and I got these awesome grants!\u201d  \n\nFrom this post I would say she probably very aware she\u2019s not as important as your birth kids.", "Your question appears to be, \u201cAITA for giving my bio kids a lot more financial support, well over $100,000 worth, than I ever offered to my adopted child, but, hey, she got to grow up in my house, so it\u2019s all good, right?\u201d  YTA and how you can say with a straight face that you love your daughter as much as your bio kids is beyond me. If you want to make a credible case for fairness or equal treatment, get out your check book & start making payments to your daughter until you get to equality.", ">but we still love her like our own\n\nDo you, though? You don't treat her the same you do your biological children. The fact that you think this person, who you chose to adopt, should just be grateful to have had a nice house to grow up in while your other children get all sorts of things you never gave her is awful. YTA.", "YTA \n\nHow is her adoption relevant? Either you see her as an equal child of yours, \u201cas if born to you\u201d or you don\u2019t.\n\nMaybe she never complained or sought your resources/assistance because she didn\u2019t know it was available to her. Maybe she\u2019s deep in debt and living on high interest credit cards. Maybe she has $100K in student loans. Maybe her nice clothing is thrifted. Maybe she doesn\u2019t have/want a partner or children because she feels she can\u2019t afford it, or believes she is incapable or unworthy of it due to whatever circumstances of her early years led to he being available for adoption. Maybe she really is debt-free and financially secure. You don\u2019t know. \n\nIf you have the means to provide a financial gift to her, decide that ahead of time and then have a conversation with her. Talk to her about how she didn\u2019t ask/you didn\u2019t offer when she was graduating high school. Or about how she appears to be successful but her siblings likely won\u2019t be so you\u2019re choosing to throw your money in support of them. Just be honest with her about why or are or are not doing similar things for her. \n\nMaybe she could use the extra money for therapy if she needs it, or philanthropy. Or travel. \n\nBut talk to HER. We can only make guesses.", "YTA - no, you clearly don\u2019t love her like your own, or she wouldn\u2019t have needed to ask for the same handouts in life that you are happily planning to give to both of your biological sons. Come on, stop playing dumb.", "YTa\n\nWhy were you expecting her to ask for help when she started college? \n\nIf you'd offered your \"daughter\" assistance so her life could a tad bit less stressful while in college but she refused it, that would be a different matter. That is not what happened. You didn't want to help her, you never asked how she was paying for all the things she needed, and you treat her like an orphan who should be grateful you \"adopted\" her.\n\n Gee whiz, OP, you aren't Parents of the Year- \"we still love her like our own\"... your own what?", "YTA. You keep saying you \"love her like your own\" but your actions speak much louder than those hollow words.", "HI, mom your exact age, here: Do you REALLY love her like your sons?? Cuz it really sounds like you don't.\n\nYou know next to nothing about her, have no intention of helping her get established in any way, have gone so far to say you don't even know how she paid for college, yet are willing help your sons monetarily with EVERYTHING?? And your reasoning is basically, \"I didn't bond with her like I did with my bio sons.\" Like, what??? How can you not see how unfair this is?? Whether you bonded with her or not is YOUR FAULT. You were the adult... you're still the adult, ffs! Step the hell up and take care of all your kids the same. \n\nOf course YTA. You're justifying playing favorites with your kids. GrossGrossGross.", "I. N. F. O. Why don\u2019t you know how your daughter paid for her post secondary education?    Good loving parents would know this, would have helped her plan, celebrate any scholarships but it looks like those conversations either didn\u2019t happen OR you\u2019re not sharing them with us \u2026.

There's no way you think you were in the right. In the situation you treated your adopted daughter less than you treated your sons. The easiest way to fix this would be to give the same amount to her and start reflecting on how you've treated her in comparison with your own children.", "YTA. The biggest of AH\u2019s. You adopted her, and treated her so different to your biological kids, and think that she had it \u2018good\u2019 because of your nice house and because you did her the favour of adopting  her? Like your some big saviour? That didn\u2019t even care enough to help her with college, or even find out how she was managing? And you\u2019re mad because she\u2019s \u2018curt\u2019. I would never speak to you again. Ever.", "YTA for the title and the very first sentence. She\u2019s your daughter. Your fucking child. Nobody cares that she was adopted. Nobody cares how long you\u2019ve known her. Except for you and your wife. The only favor you did her was house her for six years. Why did you even adopt her? The poor girl thinks she hits the jackpot getting a family at the age of 12 and then the second she graduates high school you cast her off. If you can afford to give the money to your sons you should be able to assist your daughter.", "YTA. As far as \"love her like our own,\" obviously not, as you need to differentiate. If you adopted her, she *is* your own. So, you gave her a nice house to live in? BFD, she might have been happier with loving parents and a less nice house. Further, you obviously are not at all close or emotionally invested in her...you seem to know nothing at all about either her college or life afterwards. And to top that off, you are treating your bio sons so much differently, obviously both emotionally and financially. I'm unsure if it's because she's a woman, (a different race?), or just crappy parenting, but you certainly shouldn't be surprised that she's \"curt.\" I'm surprised she speaks to you.", "Is she a stranger living in your house, because you appear to know nothing about her.

She deserves so much more than this.", "How or why did the adoption come about? Is she a relative of yours. You sound quite detached in your comments so not sure why you adopted her?", "YTA \n\nI'm smarter and more successful than my sister so the money wasn't the issue but when she was a Jr in high school my parents bought her a car. When I was a Jr in college my parents let me borrow their clunker for my senior year.

Does she not deserve the same?", "YTA, I am furious on behalf of your daughter. When you adopt a child, you treat them as equals period. You are clearly favoring your sons because they are genetically related and have known them longer (that statement was gross). It's not about the money, it's that her \"parents\" see her as less than their other children. She's probably feeling abandoned all over again.", "YTA. Don\u2019t treat your kids differently it\u2019s not fair.", "YTA - She recently got a new house. That's great! Did you help her with her down payment or give her money toward this purchase? No you didn't. So let's see you didn't buy her a car at 16, you didn't help her fund her college, you didn't help her get her house.... But for your son's you are buying both a car, paying for both colleges, and giving them a down payment for house. How do you not see how big of an asshole you are?\n\nIs she being curt? Probably. I mean you have showed her that you clearly don't care much for her or for helping her succeed, but will do everything in your power to see your bio kids succeed. I'm guessing that these are just examples of your favoritism that you are actually seeing. I wonder how long the list would be that she could give. Yes, you adopted her and made sure she had a nice house, was fed, and was safe, but did you really treat her as your own? I mean most of your info about her in this post were assumptions. And I'm sure she didn't complain because most adopted children already have been neglected and they don't want it thrown in their face that \"haven't we done enough by taking you in\" if they raise an issue about not being treated equally or wanting \"extras\". You need to apologize to her and you need to try to set it right by helping her as much as your bio kids. Yes, she has already bought her house but I'm sure she would love to be able to put a nice sized payment from you toward it so that she can have it paid off sooner.", "You\u2019ve known her for 17 years\u2026 And you say you haven\u2019t known her as long as your sons because what?

She is your child.", "YTA. How convenient that it apparently only occurred to you to buy your sons cars, pay for their college, and give them down payments for houses.

We adopted our daughter when she was 12 so we have not known her as long as my sons. We operate a small grocery store in the area and our finances are relatively OK.\n\nWhen my daughter turned 18, we offered her to keep staying with us and help out with the store but she did not want to do that and chose to go to college out of state. I can understand as it was a prestigious school. We did not pay for her education but she never asked and seemed to manage fine, I think she got some grants but also took some loans which I assume were forgiven or paid off.\n\nI do not know her finances but she seems to be doing well, she has worked for many large tech companies, recently got a nice house (not super large but very modern and new), drives a nice car and dresses really fashionably. She has no partner and kids so i assume she can save a lot. We have always been on good terms.\n\nI bought my elder son a car when he was 17, plan to do the same for my younger son, and help them both out to get a start in life by paying their college and giving them a down payment for a house each.\n\nMy daughter never complained about not getting these and she had a good childhood since we adopted her and a nice house to live in. Recently she learned of our intention to give my elder son a down payment when he finishes college and ever since while we still see her and even go to her place, my wife and I feel like she is acting curt towards us so I feel there might be some resentment. But I do not see how I could really help her since she already has these things, does not plan to have kids unlike my sons, and is much more likely to earn more from her major than my sons (unless they take over our store someday). Obviously our bond is a little different since she was adopted as an older child but we still love her like our own.\n\nAITA\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

That\u2019s a despicable reason and justification for adopting a child.

And now, for your birth children, you're offering more to them to help than anything you ever did for her.  Of course she's going to be upset.  She choose her as your daughter... but when she turned 18, she wasn't that.  She was a potential employee and not supported at all.  I'm surprised she still talks to you.  It feels obvious to me that she does not feel loved like she is one of your own.. and that you did treat her differently than your current two birth children.

You need to take a long, hard look at yourself and think about how your actions must look and feel to her. And remember that she sees how differently you treat her, the only adopted child and the only woman, from your bio sons. I don't care how well you're doing in life, that stings.

Yeah, most parents offer if they can help and don\u2019t make their kids ask. You don\u2019t even know how she paid for it or anything related to her finances? Seriously sounds like once she turned 18 and graduated high school, you pretty much checked out from actually caring.\n\n\u201cShe has no partner and kids so I assume she can save a lot.\u201d How out of touch with reality are you???? Not having a partner means she is paying for everything 100% on her own. You admit you don\u2019t know her finances. You have no clue how she\u2019s doing.

That right there is clearly showing that you don\u2019t care about her like you do your sons. This poor young woman probably already deals with feeling unloved, after having to be adopted at 12 years old, then you turn around and treat her like she\u2019s not really loved the same way as your sons?\n\nOf course she didn\u2019t complain about not getting these things. She didn\u2019t know it was a possibility. You act like you gave her the world just by allowing her to live in your nice house.

I\u2019m sure they didn\u2019t have to ask for these things, since you PLAN to give them these. \n\nAnd you sound incredibly judgmental in justifying your decision based off her decision to not have kids.

You have literally known her longer than your younger son. \n\nWhy would you adopt a child if you\u2019re going to treat them so different than your own. You have alienated her. You have treated her completely different than your sons. And she see it, I guarantee that. It basically sounds like you adopted her for the wrong reasons, like maybe the tax credits or so you\u2019d have a babysitter, not because you actually love her or care.
