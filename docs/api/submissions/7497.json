Let her mother get her butt out of bed and make her pancakes.\n\nNTA and what a weird argument.  Do people often mistake you for a servant or are they just that obnoxious?", "NAH - You don't have an obligation to feed anyone else, but it is also nice to look out for kids (especially relatives in that situation) when you can.  If I was on your side, and had cleaned everything up (assuming), I would be slightly annoyed about having to get it out and do it again.  I wouldn't have thought twice if the stuff was still out.  On their end, I would also be a little annoyed, as it seems like something that is pretty low effort and appeases a child.", "NTA - I\u2019m shocked another mother got upset at a pregnant mom who got up, made pancakes for her and those that were awake at the time, and then got too sick with morning sickness to make more before her own daughter could get any. That seems pretty selfish. I\u2019m sorry she made you feel guilty. That\u2019s a reflection of her character flaws, not yours.", "NTA- if everyone was up when you were flipping pancakes, you would\u2019ve made them. The SIL could\u2019ve just made them herself.", "NTA. I could see your SIL being upset if your niece was already up when you stated making the pancakes, or if it was later in the morning when you would reasonably expect other people to be up.", "NTA. No one else was up when you started.  And secondly their child woke up and was hungry. What would they have done if you weren\u2019t there? It\u2019s their obligation to feed them.", "INFO, your sisters phrasing is interesting. Have there been other instances of solo food making during the stay. Is this normal when you all visit?", "Info:  Is this a common problem where you only do for your kid? \n\nI just don\u2019t see why you\u2019d not make enough pancake batter to cover everyone. Or why your husband couldn\u2019t make a pancake for niece if you had to go lie down. \n\nIt just seems like there\u2019s some part of the story missing.\n\nBased solely on what you put in the OP, YTA.", "NTA. \n\nThey can make pancakes if they want some.

How about SIL makes her own kid pancakes if she\u2019s that bothered", "How would you know? Are you a mind reader? I would never expect someone outside my immediate family to cook for me. Just like I don't make food for everyone unless someone asks me first. NTA", "YTA- Short answer yes.  You didn't have morning sickness while making the batter. You could have made enough for everyone and only thinking of yourself is selfish. Being a mother, if your child woke up early and went downstairs only to be told to bad I didn't make any for you and sent your child back to you with no breakfast, you would be pissed to.

Children do not understand that type of dynamic, they just see pancakes and them not having any. \n\nThe adult thing to do would have been you or hubby whipping up a quick batch for your young niece as she's a child now she's crying and YOUR child now sees that as well and watched you or hubby not do it causing her to cry.  \n\nJust remember this when the shoe is on the other foot. No crying they could have done whatever that situation is when they repay the lack of favor. Just suck it because if you're NTA neither would they be.", "NTA - she wasn't awake.  How are you to know who wants them?", "nta i guess, i wouldn't call you an asshole over it, but common...

What I don't quite understand is why you wouldn't make batter for 4 people. It doesn't take noticeably more time to make pancake batter for 4 / 5 people than for 2 people.  \n\nIt's the same as baking a cake for 2 people instead of for the group, and then wondering why the group isn't stoked about it. You've infested their nostrils with the delicious smell of pancakes and served them disappointment for breakfast.", "NTA, You have no obligation to make breakfast for everyone and SIL is allowed her feelings but should have kept them to herself. However, cooking up a decent amount of pancakes and leaving them warming in the oven for others to have when they wake up would have been a nice thing to do while all on vacation together..", "NTA - her parents are more than capable of making them if she wanted some", "You're not obligated to make extra food for the others, but it would have been thoughtful to make a few extra in case (maybe one per person). I understand you not wanting to waste food and you weren't sure anyone else would eat them,  but they are fairly universally liked and you and your son could have eaten them the next morning. Pancakes are cheap so even if no one ate them, you'd only be throwing away maybe 15 cents per pancake. \n\nThe AH behavior is that you would have made them for your husband. She feels the same way your husband would feel if he liked them. Your SIL is hurt that you don't think of her as close family and give them the same consideration you would your own. She's also miffed that she has to get up and go through all the same motions when it would have been so easy for you to add a little more flour and one more egg (etc).\n\nINFO: If you didn't know if your husband liked pancakes or not, what would you have done?", "INFO how old is your niece?", "NTA - f\\*\\*\\* off, just because it would have been nice doesn't mean you had to make breakfast for everyone. \n\nBut if your SIL posted it here I could see me taking her side too. So, the situation sucks, not the people, and it's life, nothing is ever perfect.", "YTA because your cooking probably woke the niece up and then you decided to only cook for you and your son. When the little girl cried because you woke her up and ate all the food, you then woke up her parents at probably 5:30 am on vacation.", "NTA -- SIL is a lunatic", "YTA. Big time. It takes two seconds to whip up another pancake. When there are other kids around, I treat them like my own. I can\u2019t imagine doing that to a little kid, let alone my niece! That\u2019s just mean.", "I don\u2019t understand why you wouldn\u2019t have just made pancakes for everyone. I agree with your SIL. Yta.", "YTA....pancakes can be kept warm in an oven. That's just mean. Would you be ok if your SiL made cookies for her kid and when yours' came in from playing was told yea, sorry only made enough for my daughter.", "YTA for causing all this bs on vacation while using a shared space and not thinking of everyone while you\u2019re on a joint vacation with your in laws. How hard would it have been to make a couple more pancakes for a child? Do you do this often? Did you not think they would smell or see the food or are you so selfish you didn\u2019t care? It\u2019s also very alarming your morning sickness suddenly kicked in when you were being confronted about doing something that was perceived as selfish way to halt the conversation and gain sympathy so everyone would leave you alone. When your son is excluded and not thought of that\u2019s going to be on you bc you set the tone ppl only need to be worried about someone if they\u2019re in their presence. This is so tacky this is family your niece not a random stranger\u2026.", "YTA, you woke earlier but so did you son and your husband? Does your niece usually wake up early or it was only this time? Couldn't you explain to your husband that you were not feeling well and for him to fix something up? Did you had to wake up your nieces parents just so she wouldn't be bothering you?", "YTA the smell of cooking is going to wake someone up. Make some extra pancakes. Don't be rude. Damn.", "A 7 year old? Seriously? Your own niece?  Pancakes take 2 minutes to make at most. You are not a nice person.  Just wait til your kid gets karma due to your actions.  Hope his Aunt is kinder.  YTA", "Your actions make sense as described, but SILs do\nToo, from a place of, while on vacation, she was awoke at 5:30? AM, by a crying child because of the actions of your family. Why couldn\u2019t your husband whip up some pancakes for niece while you dealt with morning sickness?", "Ehhh NAH, maybe a super super super soft Y T A. Not even asshole, honestly, it\u2019s mild dickishness at worst. I totally see your side, but with pancake batter it really wouldn\u2019t take that much more effort, would it? Especially because it\u2019s in a shared space on vacation.", "Yep, YTA. Of course the other child woke up and wanted the food they could smell. And you have a child so you knew this was likely.", "YTA if I\u2019m making breakfast, I\u2019m making enough for everyone in the house.  Not waiting until it\u2019s gone and say \u201coh you were asleep, I didn\u2019t know other people ate breakfast when they wake up, sucks you slept and missed it\u201d wtf.", "YTA\nIt's a vacation with the family and you made something virtually guaranteed to attract children you knew were there. You should have made extra since you knew you couldn't make any after. \nOnly feeding one child pancakes is a jerk move.", "Sorry I think YTA. It's not like pancakes are hard. Making a few extra would have been no trouble. Morning sickness sounds kind of like a cop out to me honestly. I would think it was crappy if I were your niece's parents too. Of course you're not obligated to do it but she's your niece... The fact that you didn't just suck it up and make her some quick when she was upset seems odd to me.", "NTA but it wouldn\u2019t have hurt to make one or two extra.", "Love the fact that people that say NTA, are the same people that that lean more socialist but they responded in a capitalist way. She made them and  gave them to people she wanted to, she doesn't need to give to anyone else. Even though they are in the same home.", "I feel like if you are a guest you would want to do something like make extra pancakes for them out of good manners and courtesy. It is weird that you were well enough to want and make pancakes for yourself and son but were too sick to make a few pancakes for your niece and dumped her back upstairs onto her mom. Yta.", "I wont say YTA since you were sick, but couldn't your husband have made the little girl a couple pancakes?  I don't eat pancakes either but if I (a guy and husband) was in that situation that's what I wouldve done.  It takes about a minute to mix the batter and a couple minutes to cook.  If the situation was reversed and your child was up early with them and they were having breakfast, wouldn't you be annoyed if they said \"sorry no food for you, go wake your parents\"?", "YTA. The difference in effort from making pancake batter for 2 people vs making pancake batter for everyone is negligible. \n\nYou messed up.", "ESH. You could have easily made more batter, ffs, you knew there was another kid in the house. Did you expect her to not want any?

We\u2019d travel to meet relatives at least once or twice a year as a kid because we lived away from everyone whether it was another state or another country. Never would an aunt or uncle act feed their kids and not include me. It was just unthinkable. My parents would look out for my cousins like they were their own, just like others would look out for me and my siblings.

You don't have to stand there and cook for everyone, of course, but how hard is it to make whatever you want for yourself and your kid and then leave the bowl in the fridge for everyone else when they wake up?

No way if I was up with one of them at 5 would they make enough for the people waking up at 8,9 or even later than that. That\u2019s crazy.

Yuck.", "But if you don\u2019t get up until 8, now you\u2019re eating gross cold pancakes or dried out reheated ones.", "Pancake batter gets better as it sits. Ideally, you make it the night before for the best textured pancakes.", "I live alone and I eat pancakes every morning.

The batter lasts at least 3 days before I use it up, and it's actually better once it's rested a while.", "If you had made a bunch of pancakes while vacationing with my family, they likely would have been wasted.  The assumption that everyone likes pancakes is just wrong.  If you woke me up because my kid wanted pancakes but there weren\u2019t any left and you weren\u2019t feeling well, I would have gotten out of bed, told you to take care of your needs while I watch the kids, and then made more pancakes.  I wouldn\u2019t be mad at you, and I wouldn\u2019t even think twice about it.\n\nI\u2019m honestly shocked that people think it\u2019s wrong that you couldn\u2019t make more and woke up her parents.

Even as an adult, if you say you\u2019re making pot roast, for example, I mentally prepare myself for it to taste wrong. LOL", "Yeah, I'm sorry -- I don't think not having been pregnant disqualifies me from this particular opinion. I understand it was a craving. I understand the morning sickness. I do not think she owed the whole house pancakes. \n\nBut I do think she has to take the lump of having annoyed her SIL because the outcome of making pancakes at 5AM resulting in a crying 7yo who now wants pancakes from her formerly sleeping mother at 6AM was a predictable one.", "OP didn't have to make the pancakes, just set up the batter and have then ready to make as people woke up.", "That\u2019s actually what I meant. Her making extra batter is immaterial since any other adult could whip up more in 30 seconds.", "I was cracking up when i read that comment lmao", "I needed to vomit otherwise I would've made her some.

I don't like sweet breakfast much, and if I do like the item, I see it as a late night dessert type thing, not first thing you eat in the morning type food. I used to fight it. But then I took a different approach. He gets his fruit and veggies from lunch and dinner. I let him have dessert after dinner every night but if he got sugar that morning he gets sugar from fruit as dessert or maybe a handful of chips (if it's already been a healthy day). He eats very healthy but also gets his treats everyday and I noticed this caused him to eat less junk otherwise. Before he'd try to stuff as much junk as his dad would allow, which was a lot because he likes it, too. Now, since he knows he'll get dessert, he just waits for it. And since he just ate dinner, he's too full to eat too much. He's only 9 though, almost 10. We'll see how long it lasts lol", "UK pancakes are literally just eggs, flour and milk.

Everyone else was sleeping, why would she make for everyone", "Seriously, at most OP is \u201cslightly inconsiderate\u201c and I personally don\u2019t even believe that", "OP woke up at 5, making pancakes and eating them certainly doesn\u2019t take that long. It\u2019s not reasonable to expect her to predict the future.", "Exactly that!", "I agree on anything except for \"Not her kid, not her problem\": if the niece *had* been awake, it would have been an AH move to only make breakfast for herself and her child.", "Lol, for real, I don't understand how this YTA comment is getting so many upvotes. \nIt was fucking 5am in the morning with everyone else asleep, AND you were done by the time the kid walks in. If she still wants some, her mom can make 'em. Fuck 'em. I hope those pancakes were delicious.", "This exactly me: one egg, 1/4 cup flour and a lot of milk. But now my next door neighbour makes dozens of paper-thin pancakes and shares, I don\u2019t bother.", "It feels like the OP has the chore of being a cook for everybody because she was awake at 5 am. That seems very unfair, especially if she was awake because of a bad night's sleep caused by medical issues.\n\n\"The early bird catches the worm\" is the saying. That bird isn't expected to catch all the worms for the bird's extended family who chose to sleep in.", "Also forgetting the little girl came in after they were done. They act like she cooked and ate in front of her like bffr", "Just ignore this argument, no one would be saying you should have prepared 10-15 bowls of cereal if that\u2019s what you were making \ud83d\ude44", "That\u2019s what I\u2019m getting at too. Another point being that if she\u2019s hungry she\u2019s gonna get up. At least that\u2019s what\u2019s going on with my pregnancy. Sometimes I just get something for myself at random times like 2,3,4 or even 5 am just because I\u2019m hungry.", "The mental gymnastics people are making to try to justify a YTA veredict are astounding", "Sounds like a good rule once you've established it and everyone understands it.", "Why would you want cold pancakes when you can get help making them later on? I\u2019m sure OP was willing to help make more later. I have never seen anyone cook that far ahead of time in the morning at least in my family.", "My bf screwed up making jello once so this seems possible to me. And I screwed up Kraft Macaroni and cheese when I was 10. If someone isn\u2019t taught to cook or just doesn\u2019t know how it\u2019s very easy to make mistakes with basic dishes.", "That\u2019s not always the case. For example for me and my family, my boyfriend absolutely loves eating eggs in the morning wouldn\u2019t mind having them everyday. However not everyone wants to have eggs for breakfast everyday, sometimes they will want the same sometimes they won\u2019t. In that case sometimes if I cook thinking of everyone food goes to waste. What I do now to handle that is make good for me and my bf. If someone happens to come while we are eating I\u2019ll offer some if they accept I\u2019ll make some more for them. If not they make what they want. To add on I\u2019m sure it would be very unreasonable to wake everyone up just to ask them if they would also like some pancakes at 5AM IN THE MORNING.", "Amen to that. \n\nWe just got back from family vacation and it was pretty much a given that every time food was made  it was a \u201chow many people are having this?\u201d Moment. \nIf someone else\u2019s kid got up because they heard us up we definitely included them in our breakfast and I made them food to let the parent sleep.", "Except the other parents aren't pregnant, only op is. It makes no sense to compare them. Even then, op would be the asshole for demanding someone else make her kid breakfast.", "Pancakes are not complicated. For fucks sake what is wrong with you people? She got up at 5 fucking AM. Why the hell would she make for everyone on vacation when there's no way of knowing when they will be up or who will want pancakes and who won't. Pancakes take 5 minutes to mix the batter and two minutes to cook. If they want them when they get up, they can make them.", "Okay but batter takes like 30 seconds to make. It's not like the pancakes would have been cooked if she had done extra batter.\n\nWhat isn't being mentioned enough is why her husband couldn't help out.", "Do you think you need to be a Michelin chef to make pancakes? It\u2019s powder and water at its easiest.", "> If you are going to make something complicated \n\nbro if you think making pancakes is complicated, you need to up your cooking game lol", "Off that logic the OP should have meal prepped for the entire day and done all the cleaning because she's a guest. Like what the fuck, let someone make their own meal. It would be rude to even wake everyone up at 5am to offer pancakes as well lol. OP did nothing wrong. Insane how people cry out YTA on a preggo guest.", "She also said that he has no idea how to cook them either", "The batter keeps well for a couple of days -- some people claim it actually improves. I guess the  \"smart\" move would be to make extra batter and stuff it back in the fridge in case other people wanted pancakes later but OP is NTA regardless.", "Yes! When my husband and his brothers were teenagers, my in-laws would make piles and piles of pancakes and keep the freezer stocked. Even when it was just my youngest brother in law there, there would be at least one bag in the freezer.", "I go on vacation with my family sometimes to a cabin in Wisconsin. \n\nIf my grandpa, who doesn\u2019t sleep well, wakes up and makes himself and my mom, who wakes up if she hears anyone, some pancakes, and doesn\u2019t make me any *if it\u2019s 5am*. Who the fuck gives a shit. First of all, it\u2019s some pancakes, it\u2019s not like you stole all of her toys, kicked her, and shaved her bald. Second of all, my grandpa would just *make some more whenever I woke up* if I wanted any.\n\nGiven OP had some pretty bad morning sickness, and she passed the kid off to her parents, *why can\u2019t the parents just make their kid some fucking pancakes*. Why does everything have to be some massive argument. They\u2019re a family.\n\nThe in-laws are unreasonable here, OP was feeling sick, you seriously can\u2019t just step in and make some more pancakes for your *own fucking kid*?", "I salute your unsweetened applesauce. \n\nBut raise you real maple syrup - grade A dark amber, if I can\u2019t get grade B.\n\nI have no idea how people eat pancake syrup, it\u2019s just nasty brown corn syrup and is generally gross.", "The term \"morning sickness\" is used and accepted as pregnancy, so i would assume she is pregnant. \n\nI used to puke 20 minutes after eating anything after 5pm, with my first pregnancy. I would only puke this once per evening, though, so I would deliberately eat something just to trigger the puking and get it done so that I could then wat my dinner without puking it up too.", "What works for my kids and I is to cook everything first. Serve the eggs, sausage/bacon, fruit and they start munching on that while the pancakes are started on. Then make pancakes double the size of a half dollar. Give them 1-2 and good to go!", "Banana pancakes! Banana + egg + oats! Done :)", "Oooh another really good one.  \n\n\nThe Taqueria in my hometown does the extract and cinnamon. \n\n\nSometimes I'll use coffee creamer instead of milk for flavored pancakes."]}
