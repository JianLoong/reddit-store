He knew that his anniversary was coming up and failed to properly plan or expected free babysitting from family thinking that he could just guilt trip you. You had plans that involved money. Why didn't he take his kid with him or ask your parents to babysit? Even if he'd forgotten about such a momentus occasion it isn't your fault that he couldn't ask you ahead of time or over the phone.", "NTA. Where do people get off being furious at people because they won't do them a favor?? Where do they live that they can just demand people drop what they're doing and do things for them? You can always ask for a favor, but you have no right to be mad when someone says no, unless you're forever doing them favors and they never reciprocate, which doesn't sound like the case here.", "NTA\n\nYou've come to see your family for Easter, not to be a babysitter for your nephew. It sounds like you don't live near your family, so why should you miss out on family time when he could easily have arranged a babysitter?\n\nHis work schedule is not your problem. What would he have done if you weren't visiting? He's a total AH to assume you'd either have no plans, or you'd drop them all so he could have a night out.", "NTA. It sounds like there were at least four others in the house, so why is it all on you?", "NTA.   \nHe could have hired a sitter if you all were busy.", "NTA\n\nYour brother is being really rude. He shouldn't expect visiting family members to drop their plans to babysit for him. And why didn't he tell you he wanted you to babysit earlier?? Probably so you would have less time to think it over and realize he's pushing it on you last minute. He's an AH for not getting a sitter. It's an anniversary, he could have planned for it better much more ahead of time.", "failure to plan on his part does not constitute an emergency on your part\n\nNTA", "NTA - He is though for expecting you to drop your plans because he seemingly forgot about his anniversary and made last minute plans. If it was that important he would have found a sitter. Unless in an emergency, then good for you for sticking to your guns", "NTA. He didn't hire a sitter cuz he assumed you'd be available which is super entitled...", "NTA -- now you know he does not regard you as family, just a servant.", "NTA. You aren't a paid babysitter and they just assumed you would do it.", "NTA - you\u2019re not the family designated baby sitter", "NTA\n\nRelative or friend coming the last minute and thinks you are the babysitter right then and their is disrespectful. Your visiting because it\u2019s a family gathering right? Why should you have to take responsibility for an adult who could of and should of planned better.", "NTA.\n\nYour brother could have said plainly, \"Can you sit for my two-year-old on such and such date?\" Instead, he assumed, since he was calling you specifically, that you would sit for him when the time came.\n\nDirect talk is best with family members.", "NTA. \n\nHe decided what you should do with your free time. Weird that it didn't work out the way he imagined, but fantasies are like that sometimes.", "NTA  re-reading the post, I can see where your brother may have implied that he wanted you to babysit for them so that he could go out for his 5th anniversary, But I can also read that as letting you know that he would be unavailable Saturday night to do something because he was going out with his wife.  If he did not specifically ask you to babysit, then that is on him for waiting to ask you.  You already made family plans to spend time with your brother and sister by then.\n\nYour older brother is TA for assuming that you would be the baby sitter service when he did not specifically ask you earlier.", "\"You've had literally 5 years to plan for this night. If it were really important to you, you had any number of opportunities to secure babysitting services before the last minute. And the very fact that you are pressuring me and minimizing the extent of your request even after I've made it clear that I have plans--rather than acknowledging that you made a mistake due to your own irresponsibility and are asking me for a colossal favor where you would gladly be in my debt--is proof that you wouldn't value my time/effort and would take my service for granted.\"\n\nIt fascinates me that people like your brother would rather lie and claim that they are only asking for a small favor when they're really expecting the other person to make a big sacrifice on their behalf. Sure, that strategy often works once (by tricking the other person), but then it poisons the well for all future favors... Which is probably why he doesn't have anyone else he can ask for this favor.\n\nNTA", "NTA, he should\u2019ve said that he wanted you to be a sitter. If he had made it clear you would\u2019ve said no and he would just have to hire one. He\u2019s at fault.", "NTA, your brother sounds overwhelmed. He also sounds bad at planning. I bet there's a lesson here somewhere...", "NTA. Your brother sounds very entitled to dictate how you spend your time.", "NTA\n\nHe should have asked earlier before you made other plans", "NTA - Poor planning on his part does not mean an emergency on yours. If this was something meaningful and important, he shouldn't have waited until the last minute and make plans based on assumptions of others' free time.", "NTA- A lack of planning on your brother\u2019s part does not constitute an emergency on your part. He should\u2019ve asked earlier.", "NTA. His poor prior planning is not your problem. He knew the anniversary was approaching and should have made arrangements.", "NTA. You travelled to visit your family and spend time with them, not to be a babysitter.

NTA.", "NTA Your brother should have hired a babysitter. This child is not your responsibility. It was pretty presumptuous of him to assume you'd be willing to drop your plans to babysit. The fact that he's now throwing a childish temper tantrum is on him.", "NTA. Single female relative must bend to his will. \n\nWhat else could she possibly have to do while waiting for the perfect man to come along and make her life complete.", "NTA, you were basically blindsided and then guilt tripped.", "Info what's the problem?

Unless OP thought that she (?) was being asked to take her brother's GF out for dinner or join them, what else could her brother be asking for? Still NTA as it looks like brother hoped to railroad her into agreeing to look after the 2 year old. OP's parents could have done the childminding or they could have hired a babysitter. Being a parent means learning that the kid takes priority and sometimes you need to forego some enjoyable events that you might have liked to go to. In this case, it was the anniversary dinner. Although I wouldn't be expecting any favours from big brother anytime soon.", "Info: do you have a good relationship with your brother otherwise? Was he awful to you growing up or did he love and include you in his life? What kind of relationship do you plan to have with your nephew? \n\nI have a great relationship with my niece and nephew. I would willingly watch and play with them any time. I was the one swimming with them every summer. I would ditch my friends to swim with them. Those old friends aren\u2019t my friends anymore. My niece and nephew are still my niece and nephew. \n\nYears later my sister and my niece watched one of my twins for me; so our mom could come to the hospital with me and the other twin for a medical procedure. I didn\u2019t even have to ask; as soon as I got off the phone she instantly offered. IMHO that\u2019s what family does. \n\nI do and go out of my way for my family, when I wouldn\u2019t do it for just an acquaintance. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

One is the unasked, but possibly implied question to babysit.  The other is notifying the sibling that they have other plans and cannot do something with them that night.  I can read that both ways.\n\nIf he wanted her to babysit, he should have blatantly asked on the phone call, and not waited until after she arrived to ask.", "If those relationships aren\u2019t important to foster, then don\u2019t worry about what he thinks.
