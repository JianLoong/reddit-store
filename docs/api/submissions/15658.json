Due to lack of venues avaliable, we decided to have it at a park close to the house. It will be a simple party. Music, a bouncy house, cake, and friends. That is all. The problem is there's the open park, and then across the street there is a playground where kids normally play on the weekend. I wanted to have the party at the park because 1) it has outlets that are capable of handling the bouncy house 2) it is a large enough space where we won't encroach on anyone else's space, and 3) we won't have to spend the extra money on a generator for the bouncy house.  My ex-husband has been picking and tugging at me to swap the party for across the street because of the risk of a 3 year old trying to cross the street to go to the playground. I've told him thats an asinine reasoning because the location is on the far inside part of the park about a football field away from the road) and if the parents let their child get that far away from them that's not our responsibility. He's tossed everything out there to me trying to get me to change my mind and I've held firm so far but I'm honestly just so weary and tired of it. Finally i told him either we have the party at the playground, or we have the bounce house. We're not having both. He called me an asshole for not thinking of the safety of the children. I told him \"i am thinking about their safety. The location of the party will be far away enough from the road that if they do manage to get to it then darwinism will naturally take place. And their parents should've minded them a little better.\" I got called an asshole again for that statement.\n\nAITA", "created_utc": 1682436962, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12ymw92/aita_for_putting_my_foot_down_on_where_our/", "score": 46, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Generally speaking, when you're doing things like that you need to have a permit.", "Kinda harsh, and she probably won't even remember this birthday, so you might as well save your money and do without the bounce house", ">if they do manage to get to it then darwinism will naturally take place.\n\nThat is a super weird comment to make about little children. I think overall, there shouldn't be a fight about it- especially if everyone is responsible for their own child. That being said I'm leaning more towards YTA for that comment, and for thinking he's an AH for caring about the safety of children.", "YTA. I was at NAH until your statement. That was just uncalled for. Both of you think you are being practical and I think you both make fair points. Who is paying for the bouncey house and generator? Maybe whoever is paying gets to make the final decision. \n\nBut saying if a little kid gets hit by a car if they go to the park it's \"darwinism\" is frankly an AH statement all they way around. The fact that a parent would say that about the potential of someone else's child getting hurt is horrifying.", "This is a two-parter for me. It seems like your reasoning is sound, so NTA.\n\nHowever, your delivery sucks, so for that YTA.", "It is a childs third birthday. One that will most likely not be remembered. You two \"adults\" seem like you are still fighting divorce rights. A bouncy house seems kinda much at this point.", "Honestly, it kind of sounds like you just don't want to agree with your ex. Of course the kids are going to want to play on the playground that they love and that is in eyesight.", "NTA for putting your foot down on the location of the party but YTA for that hilarious statement.", "His concerns in general are valid but his reasoning isn't as strong if what you're saying is a football field away from the road. Parents are responsible anyways but kids are like ninjas so i also get it. Hes just trying to be safe and spending a little more for a generator is worth it compared to the chance of a kid getting hit by a car to get to the playground. Is there really no other choice or are you just putting your foot down because that's what you want when you both can be happy with addressing the concerns. \n\nI think there's room to compromise. Slightly,  YTA", "No judgement but the best thing to do practically might be keep the bounce house and tell all the kids and parents you\u2019ll be taking them over to the playground after. Kids see a playground and they want to be there. Doesn\u2019t matter how many times they\u2019ve been\u2014 it\u2019s extra fun to go with all their friends. Unless you have other activities besides the bounce house I\u2019d plan on their attention waning \u2014 and whining for the playground. Perhaps you can have both without having  to move the bounce house to a more crowded area.", "ESH.  I can't imagine why you two got divorced?", "The \"darwinism\" comment just flips it to the YTA column completely, when before that it was N A H.  Seriously, who says that if a toddler gets hit by a car it is just natural selection?  OP how would you feel if your daughter was the one to try to cross the street, dies, and someone just said \"well she deserved it because she was stupid\"?  The kids are TODDLERS, like damn lady.", "ESH\n\nI, personally, found your line about darwinism funny, but at the end of the day, you two will hopefully be co-parenting your child for at least 15 years and need to figure out a better way to resolve issues.", ">if they do manage to get to it then darwinism will naturally take place\n\nNTA for standing firm in what you want and what seems practical rather than some \"what if\" scenario that will likely never happen. And I agree with you. But wow, putting things like that (though it got a chuckle from me) could be construed as maybe a little insensitive? hahaha", "NTA and you don't want uninvited people turning up for the party if you host it at a playground. Doubt if you are able to lock the playground for just the invitees if its a communal one. Also with a bouncy house and 3 year olds, its better to keep them separate from the rest of the kids who may want to visit the playground, making your choice a lot better than the playground as it may have older kids and might interfere with the party. It might be worth asking your husband why his choice is so important and why he keeps demanding that it is done on the other side? Also with 3 year olds, doubt if any will walk all the way by themselves to the other side without their parents noticing.", "How about asking your daughter which one she preferred? Then go with that.", "Info- have you contacted the park district and are you going to allow kids who are in the area to use the bounce house? I think you\u2019re going to end up monopolizing a public park which would make YTA", "INFO: How would he feel about paying for the extra expense himself?  If you haven't tried that idea, tentative NAH.  If you've suggested it but he's refused because for some reason he feels it's your responsibility, NTA.  (I would also suggest maybe rethinking the music if you're doing it at the playground since as you say you'll likely be in others' space there.  Again, see how he feels when you bring this up, if you choose to do so.  Although I feel like he'd be a \"who cares about them, they can deal with it\" mentality from what you've outlined about him.)", "YTA put the bounce house near the playground.  They are 3 they will want to play.  If there is an extra cost for a generator, then tell him he will have to pay that.", "uh, I'm gonna go with ESH for this one. Y'all just seem like you're arguing just to argue at this point - his concerns are a little unfounded if the park really is that big, but your comments about Darwinism and lack of care about the potential kids being run over is a little weird, too. Not that it's a major risk, but your reaction to his concerns is a little on the gross side, too. If the playground isn't big enough to host the bouncy castle and the kids without disrupting other kids it probably should take place on the field, but your attitude towards your ex-husband's concerns is kind of weird and it feels like you're just using this as an excuse to push and pull for control over your kid with each other.", "ESH. I\u2019m guessing your toddler isn\u2019t a runner. Both of mine were, and I absolutely would have skipped any party that wasn\u2019t enclosed at that age, but that\u2019s my own experience with two particularly speedy explorers. \n\nIn any case, you both have valid points, and I think your husband is right that there\u2019s a decent chance of some kids beelining it to the playground, but if anyone chooses to partake in the party, they\u2019re signing up to manage that. To be clear, so are you. If you host a party, you are at least somewhat responsible for generally doing your best sure that people there don\u2019t actually die by avoidable actions. You\u2019d better be ready to run after any kid if her mom is distracted cleaning smooshed cake off her skirt or chitchatting with a friend.", "NTA and I venture to guess that he may be resentful that you have planned a super fun party? His reasoning is totally unfounded, if there is a park across the street from a playground, are you never supposed to have anything that's remotely appealing to children in the park? I'm sure you're not the only person that has ever had a kids party at the park. Maybe you should be mad at people for putting a playground in across the street from a park! Lol! What if kids playing in the park are tempted by playground equipment? He's being totally unreasonable and I expect that there are reasons that run deeper than some imagined danger.", "NTA for the opinion but you probably could've made it in a better way lol. Try to remember that it's a good thing he's worried about their safety even if he seems to be worrying too much.", "I vote for the party being farther from the playground because I would be more worried about other families (not guests) and children trying to get in the bounce house/ be a part of the activities.  You can make a trip to the playgroup a part of the day, one of you or a volunteer parent stays with the party setup. The other goes with the kids and their parents over to the playground.  (I\u2019ve done this). The fun of a bounce house will wane after about an hour so make sure you have plenty of other age appropriate games/ activities planned.  Realistically your child will not remember this birthday.  The bounce house will be more fun in the moment since the playground is a normal occurrence.  Make sure you let parents know you do expect them to stay with their young child.  (Feed them please).  NTA.", "NTA - I like the comment about Darwinism, it\u2019s so true but some how people get butt hurt by it.

You're allowed to do that.", "My niece had a bounce house at her 3rd birthday party a few months ago. She and the other kids loved it.", "The main reason why I'm putting my foot down is because the playground area is significantly smaller and the party is during prime playground hours. So you're talking about a bouncy house, 15-20 kids, similar amount adults in a space along with other families and children trying to enjoy a small playground.

So you may end up with even more than 15-20. But on the other hand 15-20 kids seems like too much for just an empty park/no playground and one bounce house. So I guess ESH?", "I don't see the problem with having the bouncy house but more of the compromise.  Sometimes it can be difficult but it's easiest for you in the long run. Have him pay for the generator and take it to another park maybe?", "I was trying to use sarcasm to point out that you both don't seem to compromise very well.", "So what\u2019s the issue?", "Personally I found that comment pretty funny, harmless dark humor doesn\u2019t make someone an AH imo, but maybe I\u2019m the problem lol. \n\nI agree though, ESH/NAH.

Is it a risk? Yes. Is that risk preventable as long as the adults present have at least 2 brain cells to rub together?
