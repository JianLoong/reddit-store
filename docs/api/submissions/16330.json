None of you are emotionally invested in this and you can be objective. If I am the one who is the asshole here I will accept it and do what I need to. But I do think I (35F) am right about this.\n\nTwo years ago this month my sister and brother-in-law (31 F&M) suffered a tragedy. Their four month old son died. They had decided to have him sleep with them in their own bed instead of getting him his own crib and it went wrong. It wrecked them. They were destroyed by it and they are still feeling the grief now. I helped pay for the funeral and the headstone. Both of them went on leave from their jobs and myself and the rest of my family and my BIL\u2019s family helped them out. We were chipping in to pay the mortgage, to buy groceries and for other bills. I truly did not mind and was happy to help any way I could. It extended beyond money and into things like driving them to therapy or doing chores around their house so everything didn\u2019t fall apart. It was bad and some days my sister and BIL couldn\u2019t even get out of bed.\n\nLike I said I was happy to help. But it\u2019s two years now. Neither of them are back at work and their leave ran out a long time ago so they\u2019re unemployed now. They\u2019re still grieving and not even close to getting back to normal (as close as a new normal can be). When it came time to give money for the mortgage and bills I said I could no longer do it. I am happy to still occasionally do things like drive them to therapy or do chores at their house but nothing financial. I have my own life to live. I just qualified for PSFL program the (public service loan forgiveness) since I\u2019ve been a public defender for 10 years now. I don't have any debt and can look towards saving for a down payment. I've run the numbers and talked to my advisor and it is something I can afford now.\n\nNo one is happy with me and I am getting called selfish and accused of turning my back on family. I think two years is enough. We don\u2019t have a big family and neither does my BIL. My parents have dipped into their retirement and I am pretty sure his parents and his uncle have too. His own brother is driving a car that is falling apart and still living with roommates instead of on his own because he\u2019s chipping in. Lots of their friendships have ended because people stopped wanting to give money because they could not afford it.\n\nSomeone told my sister and BIL that I won\u2019t be giving over any more money at all, or as much of my time as before and my sister tore into me. I have let it slide in the past when grief has been too much and she always apologizes after for being a jerk but not this time. My parents said they were disappointed in me. So I have to ask: Since everyone is against me and telling me I\u2019m the TA does it actually make me TA in this situation?", "created_utc": 1683162132, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1375aop/wibta_if_i_stopped_giving_money_to_my_grieving/", "score": 330, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

And you've been a very good sister to help out for these two years.\n\nIn the beginning profound grief can take a bunch of mental coping programs offline, and a person can be literally \"prostrated with grief\" ie unable to get out of bed. But part of moving forward with that loss, and living to honour the lost person, is an active choice to re-engage with life.\n\nAs a widow, I know that grief has its own processing timetable for the person(s) most directly affected. But honestly -- full financial helplessness, outsourcing normal responsibilities and demanding support for TWO YEARS is...excessive and worrying. So if you want \"permission to stop\" I would gladly give it. Your sister and BIL are free to feel their feelings, all of them -- but not to wreck your dreams and siphon your resources \"because tragedy\".\n\nNot surprised to hear that friendships have ended. Frankly anyone who is still impoverishing themselves to prolong this unsustainable situation is an ENABLER, not a helper. I'm glad you've decided not to be one of those folks anymore.\n\n>my sister tore into me\n\nYowch. Sounds like your sister is heavily invested in staying helpless and being coddled and cared for like a dependent child ...perhaps because if she gets on her feet and decides to adult again, she's going to have to *learn to live with* the dreadful consequences of the choice she made about her baby's sleeping arrangements. Many people cannot bear to feel profound guilt, and will do anything to avoid it -- including rage explosions. Just a wild guess -- I'm glad she has a therapist, anyway.\n\nSorry for the long answer -- your family has gone through hell but you, personally, do not have to choose to stay there and sacrifice YOUR dreams. Go forward -- and maybe some of the enablers will see your good example and follow you.\n\nNTA -- so, so, so NTA\n\n<Edited to add: Thank you very kindly for the award, kind Redditor>", "NTA. You've helped them for 2 years. It really is time for them to get back to work and for you to save for your own home.", "2 years?  Tragic yes, but 2 years?  I feel like they are fleecing you all for a free ride by now. If they are unable to live healthy productive lives by now, maybe it\u2019s time to get them committed so they can get some real help. NTA and to have to listen to someone tear into you because you aren\u2019t supporting their grown butts anymore is ridiculous.", "I am truly sorry for your family's loss, but NTA. They need to be going into intense counseling to deal with their grief, and all of those relatives who are chastising you should be working together to convince your sister and BIL to do just that.  \n\n\nThere is a saying that I learned on this sub: don't set yourself on fire to keep others warm. You need to take care of yourself.", "Absolutely, 100% NTA.\n\nI can't imagine what your Sister and BIL went through. However, whatever therapy they're in clearly isn't working. It's been two years. They have to become functioning adults. They can't leach off of you and your other family members forever.\n\nYour other family members are enabling them. If they're so concerned, they can find a way to make up for the money (YOUR MONEY that you are allowed to do whatever you want with) they'll no longer be receiving from you.", "NTA - This was an horrific tragedy for them with out a doubt, but 2 years is too long to let their family support them.  As so many have written on this sub:  You can\u2019t set yourself on fire to keep others warm.\u201d  You\u2019ve done your part and have your own financial goals.  Now it\u2019s on them.  I cannot imagine the pain of losing a child, nor can I imagine letting someone else support me for 2 years.", "NTA\n\nAt this point, giving them money is enabling them. \n\nBy no longer giving them money, you're indirectly helping them get back on their feet.", "I am so sorry for your family's loss and the suffering this has brought on everyone. \n\nIt has been so sweet of you to help them. Frankly, there was no real obligation for you to help them in the first place. You did it because it felt right, and the world would be a better place if more people helped lift each other up.\n\nThat being said, one has to find the fine line between supporting and enabling. I can't help but wonder how wallowing in it as opposed to getting back into work and life has drawn this process out. If I were in your shoes, I'd have a difficult conversation with my family about helping them move forward. Maybe that's getting them to move to a new space, start work again, or having them committed. They're either not actually talking to a therapist, not seeing a good therapist, or ignoring therapy. It's time to move forward. \n\nNTA", "NTA\n\ntwo years is above and beyond.", "You are NTA. If they are so debilitated that they cannot work after two years then they should be exploring disability benefits. Or they need to come around and join society again. And your family needs to stop enabling them. Of course what happened to them is an unimaginable tragedy. But they need to get past it and get on with their lives. It\u2019s not your responsibility to continue ti care for them. They are adults. It\u2019s time they acted like it.", "NTA  they are enabling and taking advantage.. once the other family get to a point where they are broke and cant afford to live hopefully your sister let them move in....\nU have your own life to live.... \nBlock them all..", "NTA. You have been supportive but it has been 2 years. At some point they need to start moving forward again. Enabling them to continue on in their current cycles of depression isn't helping them anymore.", "NTA. Yes, they suffered a horrific loss. But they have to learn how to get on with life.  If this is truly the product of grief they are not helping themselves by hiding from the world. \n\nAnd either way, they cannot expect their families to support them for the rest of their lives. OP you have to take care of yourself and plan for your own future. \n\nIt is great if you keep helping in small ways, but don\u2019t let them fob off all of their responsibilities. Keep them going to therapy, but it\u2019s time to rejoin the living.", "NTA. If she is capable enough to chase and guilt people for money, she is capable enough to go make her own.", "NTA. Regardless of the tragedy, and losing a child is about the worst, at some point in time you need to pull yourself together and move on with your life. That point in time is less than two years.", "NTA.  They need to pull themselves together.  It is completely unreasonable to expect family to support you for 2 years.  I can see a month but no more than that.  Life goes on.", "NTA. Expecting to be supported 2 years later is abusive and ridiculous.", "This is very tragic and I\u2019m very sorry for what your family is going through. But two years of financially supporting them is enough. The only way they will ever get to a stable place is by going through the motions of life like getting a job. Depression is a nasty disease but not something that should cause a financial impact to others like this. If they have a home they could sell it and downsize not force hardship on their family. NTA I\u2019m sorry you are being pressured by your family.", "NTA. Two years is a way to long. Granted people greave differently but it's time to go back to work. Get some serious grief counseling if they haven't. Don't let family play the guilt card. It's nice to help out but they've passed that point.", "NTA.\n\nThere is no timeline for grief, but no one is obligated to put their life on hold for someone else. Which is what you'd have to do to continue to financially take care of them.\n\nI can't imagine the grief of losing an infant, and desperately hope I never find out. But the fact that neither of these two is functional after two years says one of two things to me. A) whatever treatment and support they are getting is not effective and is not actually helping them or B) they don't want to get better. Maybe it's the trauma of losing a child, maybe it's realising that they like not having to work and worry about bills. But they aren't getting better and at some point you have to cut your losses and take care of yourself.\n\nThe rest of the family is mad because as the support circle around these two loses a member, it increases the burden on the remainder. And it's entirely likely that those who remain aren't ready to deal with the fact that things aren't getting better, and it's time to change tactics. Doesn't mean go straight to the school if hard knocks, but it might mean asking some deep questions no one's going to like the answers to. And some very hard, emotionally charged conversations that could damage relationships. But there's no winning for anyone here.\n\nSorry for your loss, but good luck with the house fund!", "NTA- As a parent who lost a child I understand their grief. Unfortunately life goes on and they need to go back to work. This will help with the grief process. Keeping busy will lessen the pain and horrible thoughts.\n2 years worth of financial assistance is more than enough. I\u2019m sure their therapists will tell them the same thing.\n\nAlso, how are they paying for their medical?\n\nEdit- I went back to work after 10 weeks. It wasn\u2019t easy at first but it\u2019s helped me become a part of the person I was before my loss.", "NTA!!! This is crazy.", "NTA\n\nIt's a sad and tragic situation, for sure. But you and the rest of the family members who have been contributing have gone above and beyond and it's untenable to do that forever.\n\nSounds like whatever therapy your sister and BIL are getting isn't helping at all. Maybe if they stop getting as much financial support as they have been they'll start to find a way out of the grief and inertia they've been experiencing. I sure hope so.", "NTA.

When their work leaves were about to run out, you and your family should have explained that they needed to face life and go back to work.  Yes, it\u2019s hard, but life is hard.

What happened due to their behavior was horrific, and my heart goes out to you and your family. \n\nPlease forgive me for suggesting a possible diagnosis and comments on treatment.

PTSD is characterized primarily by feelings of horror and helplessness in a life or death type situation. \n\nI think you need to have a gentle conversation with them, possibly in a family therapy session. Leave your family out of it, just have you and them. \n\nYou\u2019ve said a lot about how much you and your family are doing to help them. But what are they doing? I mean, after two years they are still massively depressed. To be fair, two years after what they went through is nothing. However, your family doesn\u2019t have bottomless deep pockets. \n\nAre they actively trying to heal? What is their plan? Do they go to therapy weekly? Do they think they have a good therapist(s)? Have meds been prescribed by a psychiatrist if indicated, and are they compliant with taking them? Have any therapies been tried that specifically focus on healing trauma, such as EMDR? Can they apply for an extension of benefits?\n\nIt might be helpful for the therapist to know that you are burning through your funds and can\u2019t afford to keep paying, yet are being pressured by other family to pay. Avoid speaking /for/ your family. Work as a team on how to create a plan that will help them get back on their feet, at least enough to bring in some income. \n\nThere is a severity level rating for depression\u2014mild, moderate and severe.

So, is there something they could be doing that they aren\u2019t that may help lessen their symptoms? Like meds, if the psychiatrist recommends them. Or if they\u2019re taking meds, is the dose high enough? When was the last time they had a psych med review? Have they made any progress at all?\n\nIt\u2019s not practical to continue supporting them if they aren\u2019t fully engaged, as best as their broken selves can be, in finding their way out of the middle of these dark woods. It\u2019s not enough to financially support them with fingers crossed in hopes they get better before everyone\u2019s money runs out. They need a workable plan, which might include moving in with family to save money. \n\nI don\u2019t have all the answers but that\u2019s my two cents worth. Be super gentle with them. Thinking they\u2019re going to lose their financial support may depress them further, or trigger anxiety. \n\nI wish you and your family the best.

To mitigate the blow of your support falling away, consider phasing out the help and for the remainder of the time conditioning it upon them going into grief counselling and therapy (which it doesn\u2019t seem like they have been benefitting of so far). As grief educator, it is something I occasionally come across: They have gotten completely stuck in their grieving process, likely due to feelings of guilt, in a way that renders them at this stage still unable to re-enter life. 2 years of being completely stuck like that is a phenomenon called complicated grief, that requires working closely with qualified professionals.", "NTA, it\u2019s a sad situation but they need to get on with their lives and work again.

They could very well still not be able to return to living semi normal lives. So I don't want to accuse them of just trying to get a free ride out of you and the rest of your family. But I can not fathom why everyone is more interested in being mad at you for not financially contributing and less interested in being concerned that after 2 years, your sister and BIL still need the help. Even taking the \"selfish\" concerns like not being able to retire or put money away for your own futures, I feel like your family should be seriously questioning your sister/BIL's mental health and how long it will be before they can live independently again.", "NTA. They have wallowed in grief long enough. It sounds like they actually need a firm push to get their lives back in order. I also tend to agree with others that their misery, while no doubt heartfelt, is ultimately self inflicted - they paid the price for indulging in quite risky behavior with their baby. \n\nAnd as a fellow public defender, your life is stressful enough and I\u2019m sure your pay isn\u2019t all that, either, that you can keep supporting two people who won\u2019t help themselves.", "NTA you can\u2019t do it forever.

Since they are unemployed they could get welfare and live in a rented apartment instead of a house with a mortgage. If there was some sort of plan on how to move forward that would help. Sorry you are in this situation.", "NTA at  best your sister and BIL are in a deep depression but at 2 years that is WAY beyond your responsibility and control. If your parents feel so bad they can move in with them so they can take care of them and you need to extract yourself from this for your own future and mental health", "I understand why it started, I couldn\u2019t comprehend going through something of that magnitude none the less being responsible for it. However, I think at this point the generosity is enabling them to stay in moment and not move on from it. While it may be painful to them having routines and social interactions is heathy and it\u2019s obvious those changes arent ones they are going to make themselves. Cutting off their funding to force them to heal is probably what\u2019s best for them, I just hope they are able to make the changes before they lose everything and are forced to.\n\nNTA", "NTA.  They accidentally killed their baby.  This will haunt them for life.  However, it doesn\u2019t mean everything is paid for and catered to them.  They don\u2019t get a free maid or home.

Do not let them house sit or live in it.", "NTA.  They made a decision that was a really stupid one and had severe consequences.  I can understand they are struggling.  But it has been 2 years that you have been supporting them.  You cannot put your own life and plans on hold for them forever, you need to be able to live your life.  You definitely are NTA if you say that you can't keep supporting them after 2 years.", "As another widow, I back this up as well. I did two weeks off for my husband before going back to work because I needed the money for my almost 7 month old and 9 year old. My bills wouldn't pay themselves and I sure as heck wasn't going to rely on family to help me. (My family would hold it over my head forever and I literally met his at the funeral).\n\nSo totally agree OP, NTA. One thing I gained from my process is no longer giving a fuck anyone thinks. If they try to manipulate you, cut them out. Its toxic behavior from them. If you need more information from me to toss at them, I'll be happy to provide more.", ">Frankly anyone who is still impoverishing themselves to prolong this unsustainable situation is an ENABLER, not a helper\n\nThis is a really good take. This is something you never truly get over. For the parents, there will never be a complete \"back to normal\". It's been 2 years and OP says they are still not even close to being back to self-sufficient. It sounds like they are taking no steps to get there and are not willing to take any. Like, do they just expect to one day feel better about it? They aren't putting any work in except for possibly therapy? Surely a therapist would not think this is healthy. \n\nAnd the family allowing them to stay stagnant by supporting this. No job, no social life, no responsibility, sleeping in all day - these cause depression, not solve it. Whatever has been going on is clearly not working, especially for the grieving parents.

But NTA for putting an end, OP has gone above and beyond.", "NTA. Has anyone in your family been able to talk to their therapists? What are they saying? I have to strongly agree that it may be time for some inpatient treatment. Whether that be voluntary or by court order. Something has to be done so they can process the trauma and get back to being half way productive members of society. They cannot expect the family to go bankrupt to pay their way for the rest of their lives. I don't know how everyone did it for 2 years.", "OP is NTA, but two years is nothing. And two years over the loss of a baby when it was your own fault? Two years is the blink of an eye.", "Life does indeed go on, whether we want it to or not. I suffered a stillbirth and had to go back to work less than three weeks later because that is what I had to do to keep my home, as did my husband. We miss and want our little guy every day, but the world didn't stop for us regardless of our emotional needs. Sometimes you just have to do what you have to do, even when the worst thing ever has happened to you. \n\nSeconding this NTA.", "That is my one concern about the situation.

I gave her warning this week that once the federal student loan repayment pause ends that I will no longer be able to do so. I wanted her to have enough time so that I wouldn't catch her off guard.", "This is an awful take! Did you miss the part where they literally killed their baby? Like this wasn't some freak accident, they went against common and well published medical advice for infant sleeping procedures designed specifically to literally prevent what happened to their baby!  Like yes it's terrible, but it was entirely preventable and now OP has funded their lifestyle for two years? Despite their grief those are 100% the most selfish and self absorbed people in the entire world. I hope OP has enough resolve to stop supporting them financially and emotionally and draw back from this dumpster fire of a situation. I'm surprised they didn't go to jail, honestly.", "Widow here too. We owned a business so two days after his death I was handling business decisions. OP is being used and also enabling their lifestyle at this point.", ">For the parents, there will never be a complete \"back to normal\"\n\nOh, absolutely true. \n\nAt some point, with baby steps, we make a new normal. \n\nAnd may never stop longing and wishing for the old normal...but we recognize that it is *gone*.", "I agree. It's terribly tragic, and I don't blame OP one bit. But two years isn't excessive. Not with something of this magnitude.", "It can mess you up permanently emotionally and mentally, but to disengage from life and existence - and expecting others to support you - for an indeterminate amount of time is where it stops being okay.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to forget that it was barely over 100 years ago that losing children was common.

Make sure that the baby sleeps without any stuffed animals, blankets, and toys in the crib and that the clothes they wear are fit and tucked. All of these things can cause asfixiantion if ignored.\n\nPlease listen to doctors and read the packets they  give you after discharge. It'll avoid preventable stuff like this happening. They are professionals and teach you this because bad things happen otherwise.", "Yes, but that doesn't entitle them to be financially supported for life as well.", "> accidentally killing your own baby might be a fucked up for life thing\n\nIt probably quite well might be.  But it also doesn't mean you can depend on your relatives to do everything for you for the rest of your life either.  \n\nAt some point you have to put your big person pants back on and start to look after yourself, take responsibility for your making sure you have somewhere to live, something to eat.\n\nOP is NTA", "A lot of marriages don't survive the death of a child either.", "I literally know nothing about children or raising them, and I'm genuinely horrified that anyone thinks having a baby sleep in bed with them is in any way safe.

I'm not the least bit surprised this ended in tragedy, how were they?\n\nEither way, I do think this would eff up any decent person.

Nobody should be asking them to \"get over it\" but after 2 years somebody has to tell them to snap out of it. There's nothing wrong with needing some help to get back to a piont that you can function, but at some point you actually have to try to function. Continuing in this stupor of broken sadness at this point is truly a choice. They just want to stay there without trying to get better. And it sounds like the rest of the family is bent on enabling this self-destructive behavior. \n\nGood for OP to try and let them know it's time to try to live again even if it hurts every minute. It's only when they actually try to move forward that they'll be able to start moving forward. Otherwise they'll be stuck in sadness and a drag on everyone around them for the rest of their lives.\n\nNTA OP, and good luck.

That said, totally abandoning their lives and living of charity can't go on forever.", "Focus. The issue isn't whether two years is or isn't the blink of an eye. They can grieve for the rest of their lives if they so choose. \n\nThe issue is that they expect everyone else to support them while they grieve. Two years. Seven years. Ten years. A completely ridiculous expectation.\n\nBelow this is a comment from a widow who very wisely says:\n\n*\"As a widow, I know that grief has its own processing timetable for the person(s) most directly affected.

My baby couldn't sleep unless I was holding him, so I was almost never sleeping. And when I did, I was falling asleep holding him.

We tried really hard to make her sleep in her crib but basically none of us slept for almost two weeks after we came back from the hospital. One time I was breastfeeding her in the middle of the night while sitting in an armchair and fell asleep and almost dropped her. I jumped awake when she started rolling down my knees. By then I was so sleep deprived and miserable that I was barely functioning and my husband had to go to work in that state, too. After that incident I thought \u201cFuck this, I\u2019m putting her in my bed\u201d. And it worked beautifully. I\u2019m a relatively light sleeper so I woke up whenever she moved or made a sound. It was a real lifesaver for us.", "The sister of a friend of mine had a mini mattress (with railings) they clamped to the side of the big bed next to the mom's head/torso area. I don't know if that's considered true co-sleeping, but it looked very cute imo.", "Same! My daughter slept either in my arms, by my side or in her stroller when we went outside. We tried everything and she wouldn\u2019t sleep in her crib EVER. I had a c section and was really slow on top if sleep deprived so if it wasn\u2019t for co-sleeping I would have probably gone nuts.", "I was so afraid this would happen to me that I set up a routine to try to prevent it.

I've known women who'd put their *shoes* in the back.", "When we first found out that my wife was pregnant, I set a routine: check the back seat *every single time* I get out of the car. I did it before we entered the \u201csleep-deprived autopilot\u201d mode, so that when we *were* running on empty, it would be automatic. Four years later, it still is, I *never* get out of the car without checking the back seat.", "That's the goal: maximum sleep.
