If I did soccer she wanted to do soccer and do it better. It was really annoying but I was always told she didn\u2019t really have a family so I should just try to grin and bear it. \n\nThen we got older and she moved out as well and we both got married within a year of each other. I hope this isn\u2019t the case but she got married to her bf of 8 months and I can\u2019t help but wonder if she did it because I was getting married. Anyway I got pregnant 2 years afterwards and had a healthy baby girl named Alicia. She had stillbirth 1 year later and then had a boy 2 years after that. When he was born he seemed normal and she bragged he was going to be a doctor and even bragged his birth weight was higher than my daughter\u2019s. She also bragged she was able to give her husband a son while I had a girl which was worth less which really pissed me off. \n\nWhen he was 1 he started behaving differently and got diagnosed with autism at 3. He is low functioning and probably can\u2019t live independently and my sister took it very hard. I think she put everything on her child and tried to have another one but kept having trouble conceiving and gave up eventually. Her husband left a few years later and she\u2019s been raising her son alone with some help from my mom. \n\nShe then started forcing everyone to celebrate her son\u2019s accomplishments with my daughter. My daughter did really well in gymnastics and later track and field and she insisted her son should get the same recognition and made the family also congratulate her son on him being great at track and field if they congratulate my daughter because \u201che would have done just as well if not better if he didn\u2019t have autism.

His accomplishments SHOULD be celebrated, his REAL accomplishments. Instead of hollow praise for stuff he hasn't done, the family should cheer what for him are major achievements. His mom is still in Full Competition mode and is clinging to what she wanted him to be, not to the worthwhile person he is.

You made your sister feel like she was just a burden or unwanted. Your sister was living in a family that didn't consider themselves to be HER family. Your sister has emotional issues that she needs therapy **because of how you and your mom treated her**\n\nYTA in the end.", " NTA/ even people with amazing grades/ extracurriculars/great MCAT scores don\u2019t get into medical school.\n\nFor her to say her son would\u2019ve been a doctor if he didn\u2019t have autism is a stretch by FAR. Also people with Autism DO BECOME DOCTORS- to blame this on autism is just wrong. \n\nSomeone in my medical school class had high functioning autism and did better than like 60% of our typical class. \n\nYour sister has a chip on her shoulder big time. I think it\u2019s great you stuck up for your daughter. Put your foot down every single time and tell her she doesn\u2019t need to come if she will be a party pooper the whole time.", "NTA. She needs therapy.", "NTA but why did it take until your daughter finished college to put your foot down?? How did she feel about having to share every accomplishment with her cousin growing up?\n\nYou should have taken some distance from your sister 20 years ago!", "You\u2019re NTA. And no one should be making you think that you are, especially your sister! Your mom shouldn\u2019t be going along with it either. \n\nYour sister should have figured out a way to celebrate her son\u2019s own achievements and successes, even if they\u2019re small. She should not be taking anything away from anyone else\u2019s accomplishments. That\u2019s rude and disrespectful. The \u201cas well or better,\u201d statements should be shut down every single time.", "NTA, but I have to relate to your nephew.\nI have a cousin with downs syndrome. The situation there is much like you described here, although not enforced by her mother. She has 2 sisters, and whenever they would have some big life event/achievement, she would include herself, and we'd congratulate her and play along with it. It made her so happy, we never had a problem with it, and it's not hurting her sisters in any way. It's just the way things were, and everyone was happy with it. \n\nSo, NTA, your sister is the a**hole, but maybe consider continuing congratulating/including the son for his sake, if it makes him happy. You shouldn't feel like it diminishes your daughters achievements, because it doesn't.", "NTA \n\nSis has issues.", "ESH.\n\nSounds like 2 now adult women who have been severely failed by all the parents/adults they had growing up.\n\nHalf sis was obviously jealous and/or mirroring older sis. And, half sis clearly was not given healthy and fulfilling relationships with adults when she was a child. OP responded to this in her own dysfunctional way because she was also a child who was not helped adequately by the adults in the situation. But, both are now adults who need to get over themselves and get in therapy to unpack and deal with their baggage.\n\nNow, for the new generation of kids:\nOP's daughter is clearly thriving despite the fact that always being compared to half-sister's fantasy child was definitely harmful to daughter. I sincerely hope she has the support and resources she may need if she ends up struggling with this history in the future. It's got to be damaging to a kid to grow up with this kind of background.\n\nHalf-sis is clearly delusional. I kinda give her credit for turning into a decent enough person to stick around and raise her kid despite how difficult it probably was given her background. But, she's failing her son by not meeting him where he is and not encouraging the maximum independence he is able to achieve. She needs to crawl out of her delusions and start recognizing her son's actual accomplishments, which he has if he's given opportunities to have his own accomplishments. His accomplishments may be different from his cousin, and may not be what the adults dreamed of for him, but he still deserves opportunities to accomplish things and have those accomplishments recognized on his own terms.\n\nEveryone looking down on half sis or her son because OP and half sis's dad is a disgusting cheating cheater who didn't have the fortitude to make sure his kids were properly cared for sucks especially hard. Put that blame and shame on dad, where it belongs. \n\nAnd, because it bears repeating, start trying to recognize and celebrate autistic son's accomplishments. And, if he doesn't have accomplishments to celebrate, get him some programming or something to give him those opportunities. Doesn't matter how small the accomplishments are, celebrate them.", "NTA but your sister just seems like a very sad woman. Maybe cut her a little slack and just humor her. Seems like she had a really rough life and you, not as much.", "NTA. Her own son absolutely can and should be celebrated, but for his own accomplishments. And his accomplishments would be directly tied to his ability. Hell, if drawing a picture was him doing a good job because that is his developmental level then that should be celebrated. But his accomplishments are separate from your daughter's and they don't have a damn thing to do with each other. Your sis is bringing on her own misery by being such an obnoxious person.", "NTA and I hate how she treats your nephew. I'm suspected of autism, and low functioning or not we are still actual human beings, and should be treated like one. She's treating her son like a toy and projecting her weird fantasies on him. Who says \"he would be a doctor if he didn't have autism\"??? She doesn't know what he would be like if he didn't have autism, because he would be a COMPLETELY DIFFERENT PERSON. Autism isn't some accessory. It shapes someone as a person. I just know she's one of those parents that makes her son's autism all about her and how \"hard\" it makes *her* life. Someone else said this, but your family should be celebrating *his* accomplishments, not your daughter's accomplishments that she thinks he would have, even if they're not as \"big\" accomplishments as becoming a doctor. I feel bad for that kid. I hope you and the rest of your family are treating him kindly, because it doesn't seem like she is.", "NTA\n\nI don't know about autism but wouldn't his mother's comments make him feel awful?? I have a nephew who is autistic and he would totally understand a comment like that. I just don't know if my wonderful nephew is high function or low functioning or what....\n\nSister sounds like she should have been in therapy at a very young age. She was the product of an affair, abandoned by her mother, probably felt like an interloper being raised by her dad's wife.... I can't even imagine how difficult that was for her as a child. \n\nLeft unchecked and enabled by your mother (\"be kind, it's not her fault\") her entitlement simply grew into a monster.", "NTA - and she's being incredibly cruel to her son.  Autistic people have accomplishments too, they don't need to have make believe accomplishments to make up for anything.  Maybe those accomplishments don't seem like that big of a deal to mom, but they are huge.  Did her son figure out how to tie his shoes after a year of OT practice?  Big accomplishment.  Did her son have a more in depth conversation than usual?  Big accomplishment (I literally email my student's parents whenever he expands his normal conversation routine because it's huge for him!)  There are so many things that Autistic kids accomplish and they should be celebrated, not some fantasy of what you would celebrate if you had neurotypical children.", "NTA. I feel bad for your sister, karma has her in chokehold. (Mostly your nephew) Misery loves company. I think it\u2019s time to cut contact. And the upmost respect for mother.", "Nta", "NTA. Also, I\u2019m much more mildly autistic than he is but I\u2019m also physically disabled and chronically ill and like - does she realise how shitty it feels to be told all the things we COULD have been, instead of celebrating our ACTUAL milestones?! It took me 2.5X as long as it should have to get my masters degree but do my family go around saying \u201cwell she could do it in 1 if she wasn\u2019t sick\u201d NO they say \u201cthat\u2019s amazing you\u2019ve achieved that, congratulations. We\u2019re proud of you\u201d I guarantee from this perspective that I and her child too have, it feels really shitty to be given pitty celebrations and not have actual milestones that we\u2019re genuinely proud of recognised. I have no idea his level of function but for example say like he has never been able to draw a picture and he finally draws one - CELEBRATE THAT! It can be just as big a celebration, but celebrate actually achieving moments to be proud of. She\u2019s probably also overlooking his real achievements while constantly making him feel inferior for not achieving what an abled person can \u2728", "I can't give a judgement here - I feel so sorry for everyone involved.  So, although no one is actually perfect here, the kindest judgement is probably NAH.  And yes, that's in spite of how annoying you find your sister.  \n\nOP, you're lashing out because you've been accompanied by an unwanted shadow sister all your life.  \n\nThe sister's delusional, because her father left her, her mother left her, her grandmother left her, and your mother took her in on sufferance.  You have no love for her either. How *can* she be expected to grow up happy & well-adjusted that way?  \n\nYour poor nephew, whom no body sees as he actually is - just as an imperfect copy of your daughter.  \n\nIt's probably too late for therapy so I think your mother is right - let it go, because anything else just increases the misery all round.", "Lady Catherine de Bourgh, in Pride and Prejudice. \n\n>\"There are few people in England, I suppose, who have more true enjoyment of music than myself, or a better natural taste. If I had ever learnt, I should have been a great proficient.\"\n\nI'm sure she also says something similar about her chronically ill daughter.", "Someone who never mourned the son they dreamed of and decided to love the son they actually have. \n\nI feel bad for the son. He's not the same person now that he was at three years old; I'm sure there were milestones that were just his that his mother could have celebrated with the family.

I believe it is because she feels she needs to be better in order to feel like she is a part of the family or to forget her own origins. Maybe she feels she has to do it otherwise she will always be an outsider because she isn't otherwise good enough.\n\nLots of mental problems there. I feel bad OP has had to put up with it all these years. OP is certainly NTA for wanting boundaries. Because in the end, it is a boundary issue really (well, and mental).", "This is honestly the best comment on here. I really feel like you hit the nail on it\u2019s head.", "Not to mention live with a family, where their father says she has no family... what is he suppose to be? Isn't he family. Add in his family apparently looks down on her for the actions of her parents. It is no wonder she tries to mirror op. I feel bad for op and her - though definitely more so OP at this point since it has continued so long and turned into such bitterness.  Then the sisters son has all of these expectations on him, and ops daughter cannot celebrate her accomplishments. Such a sad situation all around:( nta op needs to establish boundaries for sure.", "I agree with you wholeheartedly. I think the sister is extremely damaged. \n\nThat doesn\u2019t excuse her behavior but it explains it. I don\u2019t blame OP for her reaction though. She\u2019s also been pushed to her limit with what seems like no parental support. \n\nNTA OP and congrats to you daughter!", "Best reply here by a long shot. \n\nEdit: I read the latter part of your post and had some issues. I'll disagree on this: As far as your second paragraph and resolving the issue, OP cannot be the one to resolve the sister's issue not because she \"ruined that possibility\", but because she is not the appropriate person to do so on several fronts.  \n\nFirst, it's not her responsibility. \n\nSecond, she's probably not trained to do things like this.  This isn't something that can be ironed out with a nice conversation.  This is deep-rooted insecurity combined with very unhealthy coping mechanisms.\n\nThird, it's not a good idea for the object of the person's focus to be the one trying to engage her on it.  Nothing good is going to come from that.", "Of course she\u2019s not ok. Even before she was born, her existence would have been a major problem for multiple people. Then her father turned his back on her in favour of his proper family. Then her mother abandoned her. Then her grandmother abandoned her. So she ended up living with the family that she probably always thought resented her. Years later, she had a still birth, followed by one child who - let\u2019s be blunt - did not meet expectations. I\u2019m sure she loves her son, but she will also look around at all the people who have \u2018normal\u2019 children, see them achieve things that her son never will, see them forge their own paths in life, have their own families, and there will always be a sense of mourning for how her life turned out. \n\nI\u2019m not saying her behaviour should be enabled, but no she isn\u2019t ok and being judged as an AH on an internet post is not going to fix that. She needs professional help.", "[removed]", "I agree. NTA- your sister needs therapy", "Yes, all of this. Everyone in this story is a jerk. Yes, even OP.
