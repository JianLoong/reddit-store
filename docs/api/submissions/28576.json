I love her and am always excited to see her, although some of her hygeine habits are concerning to me.\n\nWhenever I'm home on leave, I'm often surprised by the mess our house is in. Don't get me wrong, I'm not a clean freak and I wouldn't expect a lived in house to be perfect. I feel like I can separate the standards expected in the Army to a normal setting and I don't expect my wife to have the place spotless. But our house verges on what I'd call squalid. I drive home to our front lawn piled with black bags, and there's plates of old food on random shelves and cabinets. Our wall beside the rubbish bin is stained brown where she throws tea bags in it from a distance and they hit the wall first, and the place never smells very good.\n\nI've asked before if she could tidy those bits up, not only because of how I feel but dirty surroundings like that really impact mental wellbeing, and it could degrade her health. Every time I say something she huffs like I'm her dad asking her to tidy her bedroom, and she says she'll do it later. I end up spending most of my leave sorting things out, only to come back to the same mess next time.\n\nI wondered if her mental health might be causing her to neglect things, and I spoke to her a bit but she wouldn't really listen.  I asked her mum and dad and they made it clear that she's always been untidy, and had to pay damages to previous landlords on old flats. Frankly she's been that way all through our relationship, but never quite as intensely and seemingly less so when I'm around.\n\nIt's one thing that we don't have children to think about, but it's not a nice environment for anyone and I think the final straw was on my last leave when I started finding used sanitary products on the bathroom floor rather than in the bin. \n\nI sat my wife down and implored her to tidy the place more often, because its her home too, she deserves a nice place to live and besides all that its a basic responsibility. She started off defensive but quickly became angry and accused me of bossing her around and expecting her to clean a large home all by herself every day when she has work to go to. I told her that I understand a place can get messy and she has a life and career to get on with, but her habits and attitude are lazy. She screamed at me to shut up and went upstairs.\n\nWe had a strained rest of my leave and I think she was more than happy to see me go.\n\nI don't know what to do. I feel the request is reasonable enough, but was I wrong to approach it as I did and call her lazy?", "created_utc": 1696853970, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/173qdms/aita_for_calling_my_wife_lazy/", "score": 204, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

This is mental illness. Lazy people don't always fold their laundry right away. Lazy people might have a few extra dishes in the sink, or let the lawn get too long or put off weeding the garden.\n\nLeaving trash bags on the lawn, throwing tea bags at the wall what the actual fuck?\n\nIf she isn't interested in helping herself, dude run. I don't know of you're planning on having kids or not but I think you know thay would be a poor choice right now. Regardless she's not planning on changing her ways. She needs to help herself.", "NTA. Your request isn't unreasonable and what you are describing is highly unhealthy environment to live in - not just mentally unhealthy, but physically so - breeding ground for mold, bacteria and pests. \n\nYour wife has always lived like this and in the past her parents have covered for her so she hasn't built in proper habits on how often to clean, how to keep things clean by doing things immediately (e.g. put the pads in the bin, not on the floor). I understand you love her very much and don't want to break the relationship but you need to communicate iwth her that she needs to build better habits and change because - yes, you are not her dad, but also more importantly she isn't your child that you should teach how to keep the house clean because they have never done that before.", "NTA\n\nAnd your concern is well founded.\n\nIts one thing to be 'untidy' but quite another to be 'unsanitary'. The old food will bring flies and other pests (cockroaches, rats etc) depending on where you live, which could be potentially life threatening.\n\nBut more than that is her mental state, thinking that living in that kind of squalor is acceptable isnt 'lazy' it is concerning.\n\nLastly, its a blessing you dont have children, who would be getting raised in that environment. If she isnt willing to get help, then is this the way you want to live?\n\nSomething to think about.", "Of course you want to come home to a clean house, I can see you\u2019re not expecting a show home but what you\u2019re describing is disgusting. \nYou could be right about her mental heath, with you being away so much it might not be good for her. But this is the life you both have and if it doesn\u2019t suit her then maybe it\u2019s time to part ways.", "NTA. This seems like more than just laziness though.", "NTA\nIs this military housing you are in. If it is and she is allowing the place to become this bad, you might want to get your housing officer involved to keep an eye while you are away to make sure that the Married Quarter is being looked after properly while you are away.\n\nYou could end up in trouble at work if she is not looking after your home.", "Calling her lazy isn\u2019t going to get you anywhere. It hurts to hear that. Of course it makes her defensive and angry.  Old habits are hard to change. And when someone never learned to make a habit of cleaning, it\u2019s even harder. But to be clear this is an unacceptable way to share living space with anyone. \nCan I suggest a different approach? Don\u2019t make it about her health (that feels patronizing). YOU have a right to feel comfortable in your own home. So tell her \u201cI can\u2019t feel at home or relaxed around trash and dirty dishes\u201d. \u201cI feel upset when I see \u2026\u201d. Make \u2018I\u2019 statements. \n\nThen pick just three things for her to work on. \u201cTidy the house\u201d feels huge and overwhelming and she will feel like a failure if she can\u2019t do it all. But a short list is more likely to be manageable \n1. Trash needs to go in trash can. 2. Dishes go back to the kitchen. 3. Pick one more. That is totally reasonable. She may not be happy about it, let her work through that. Try to give positive feedback for successful efforts. again, not in a patronizing way ie. \u201cgood job honey\u201d but instead \u201cthe living room looks so nice, thanks for your effort\u201d. \n\nOver time you can add something else to the list but start small. If any of those three requests start to slip on a regular basis, tell her \u201cthe trash is stressing me out\u201d not \u201cyou left trash around\u201d. \nAnd work with her. Don\u2019t just go clean by yourself. Set a day you both have some time (when you are on leave), make a list of cleaning tasks, blast some music and get it done together. \n\nGood luck!", "NTA\n\nKeeping a house clean, especially a large one when you are effectively living on your own is incredibly easy.  \n\nMy guess is there is some underlying mental health reason for it that should be addressed.  \n\nYour request isn't in any way unreasonable and the fact she got defensive and angry suggests something else at play.", "NTA but your arrangement does not work. If you have a job where you're technically never home, you need a partner who has a job like this, too, or is happy and capable of living on their own. Your wife sounds like she needs people around in her every day life and you sound like you don't intend on staying home permanently any time soon. Does she work at all?", "NTA\n\nWhat you\u2019re asking for is pretty much the bare minimum and would take ZERO effort to do differently or fix(well, apart from the wall stain but like, stop *throwing* tea bags?) I consider myself pretty lazy when it comes to cleaning up my house and I gotta say this sounds pretty excessive.", "NTA, but you are correct in thinking this may be a mental health issue. You need to contact someone in the mental health department of the hospital and try and get some help for her. Messy is one thing, what you are explaining is beyond healthy.", "NTA. But she's unlikely to get better. You should really consider leaving.", "NTA - she is lazy. If that is just a symptome or if that's the cause, it doesn't really matter. Why do we put down someone for being honest? What happened to being direct, to telling people the truth and people having the stoicism to take it on the chin and make amends?  \n\nI mean, we just create more fragility and egg shell walking if we stop telling the truth. \n\nCould he have framed it better? Yes. Did he try several times to? Yes. Did she react with anything else than contempt for his needs? No. NTA.", "Nta the wife is nasty", "Your request is not unreasonable especially when you provided the details you did about garbage, dirty dishes, tea bag stains, and hygiene products.  If her parents say she has always been this way, that is of concern and more than a bad habit to break.  You don't mention your finances, but maybe paying someone to come in and do a deep-clean and help her organize with the agreement that she will maintain from that point on could be an incentive to change.  It also may help to get her into therapy for some undiagnosed issues that are contributing, perhaps, issues that stem from her childhood.", "She does sound lazy AND childish.", "You were wrong to call her lazy or raise your voice, but you do have the right to tell her that you cannot live in a pile of garbage. Either she tries to live like a reasonable human being or you split up (I personally do not think that such a slob would ever change. She has already paid damages to numerous landlords because she did not learn from the consequences). It also does not bother her that her filth upsets you. \n\nMy mother once entered a neighbour's home to find dirty diapers all over the place, along with dirty dishes and laundry. Is this how you want to live once children come along. NO!", "NTA", "Since you only really spend time with her when you're home on leave maybe hire a housekeeper to come a couple days before you get home. You really shouldn't escalate a disagreement with a spouse to the level of screaming. I think it's pretty obvious that her \"mental health\" deteriorates somewhat when you're not around and it manifests in her losing interest in cleaning.", "NAH because it sounds like she is really struggling with mental health issues but you aren't an ass for wanting a reasonably clean house. I think calling her lazy was a bit much because this isn't just laziness, but something more. Maybe watch a few episodes of hoarders with your wife. Definitely get her some therapy. Maybe it's time for you to consider changing your career and be home more?", "YTA for calling her lazy but NTA got expecting a hygienic home.  This truly sounds like a mental health issue. Criticism generally doesn\u2019t motivate sustained change. A more supportive approach focused on her overall health & an offer to assist in a deep clean & maintenance plan might work better.", "So did you now know this before you married her?\n\nESH", "OP said she wasn\u2019t nearly as bad in the past, I would assume this is mental health related. She could be depressed, either way, she can\u2019t keep living like that. I would see if she would be willing to go to therapy. If not, you have to decide if it\u2019s a dealbreaker for you.", "NAH. This sounds like depression.", "NAH\u2026 she sounds like she has some kind of undiagnosed mental illness tbh. My mother is like this, cleaning is just impossible for her. Can you afford to hire a house keeper? Even occasionally to help with the bigger tasks? Also therapy.", "As a former military wife of 17 years, who dealt with many deployments and 4 kids... YOU are definitely NTA! \n\nDoes she realize that since you receive BAH you can get your CO involved if the condition is that bad and distresses you? If the condition is bad enough and wld cause legal fees against you they can get involved! Honestly,  wtf is she doing other than nothing? And please spare me the she's depressed because he's deployed speel ... you married a soldier knowing full well what it meant. If you can't handle it you leave , it does nobody any good to hang on. Especially to him when hes in the field, and her just sitting at home a depressed blob.", "NTA but I don't think you really think of her as \"lazy.\"\n\nIs there anyone who can come stay with her for a couple of weeks when you are away? They might be able to help identify what life looks like then versus you piecing things together based on what's present when you get home and the lack of responses to your inquiries. From there you can feel a bit more informed on how to move forward.\n\nSince you're willing to tidy things when you're around, maybe some of the work you can do can be things like creating a specific bin for her sanitary products and placing it under a sign that says what it is for. It's really hard to ignore a written sign every day (especially as she is working and supposedly driving, ergo her brain knows signs need to be followed). Place some clear contact paper on the wall behind the kitchen trashcan to protect the surface but also put a small waste bin next to where she usually makes her tea (use a label/sign for the countertop bin). This might help you learn more about what's going on. It might help her see what's going on and feel like you're not so absent that you're unaffected. This is all stuff that can be done immediately while you navigate the mental health angle (that is often met with a lot of resistance but this way you can feel like you are addressing something versus feeling lost and helpless).\n\nGood luck. Your fortitude will be your grace as you navigate these issues.\n\nThank you for your service.", "If she's working then try a housecleaner", "Hire a cleaning service to come by once a week.  It's literally as simple as that.", "ESH.\n\nCalling her \"lazy\" is not helpful.  She may be depressed or overworked, and she certainly seems to be a slob, but slob and lazy aren't the same thing.\n\nFor her part, yes she has a job but so do you.  It's not reasonable for her to expect anyone ELSE to clean up after HER.  She's living there alone for weeks or months at a time. Empty rooms only need to be vacuumed and dusted once a month.  She doesn't have to clean \"a large house every day\" she only needs to clean up after herself.", "Calling wife lazy - instant YTA\n\nYou can keep your attitude or your wife but you have to chose. It doesn't really matter if she has issues (mental health), doesn't find the time after work oder doesn't want to, it is how it is and it was that way from the start: \"Frankly she's been that way all through our relationship\".\n\nInsulting her doesn't say anything about her, only about you. \n\nIf you can manage, have someone help her out and/or do so yourself. You can also try to compromise but after calling her names, I don't think she will be willing to and I get that. If you can't come around with some solution, you should consider leaving. What you should never ever do is disrespecting her again, not matter if you and the whole world think you are right, because nothing in this world gives you the right to treat anyone that way.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I\u2019m not a professional, but I am autistic with a special interest is psychology and behavior, meaning I\u2019ve done *countless* hours of research and shit. It sounds like she has underlying mental illness(es) that have gone undiagnosed and untreated for a very long time, and I\u2019m willing to bet that her parents likely didn\u2019t *teach* her *how* to clean. Learning *how* to clean is critical to actually *doing it in adulthood.* what I would recommend, is that she seek a therapist and psychiatrist to help learn to cope with not only your absence being in the Army, but also just with general life stressors and trauma. I have some suspicions of at least part of what\u2019s going on; it honestly, with my limited context here, sounds like she is also on the autism spectrum but has gone undiagnosed, and it sounds like she meets a PDA profile (Pathological Demand Avoidance, which is a triggered response in the amygdala to perceived demands, where the demand triggers the amygdala and treats it like a threat to the person\u2019s autonomy). This sure complicates the situation but mainly because of the process of learning about autism, PDA, and handling it. *If it is this*, then please keep in mind that this has been all her life and that her parents are likely undiagnosed themselves and/or refused to acknowledge it in their own daughter. That first step is actually getting her *to* a therapist and psychiatrist though. There *are* ways to mitigate the responses from PDA, and honestly even if you don\u2019t know for sure that that\u2019s what it is, I\u2019d still learn how treat someone with PDA and subsequently apply that knowledge to your wife, like learning how to phrase things differently or reframe situations to make them seem less like a demand or threat to their autonomy for example. Just kind of observe her behavior and reactions to the changes in your own behavior. Then, if this isn\u2019t too much to ask *you*, is that when you\u2019re home, that you take some time to help her and show her *how* to clean, but making it seem more like a refreshing, mind-clearing activity than a chore. (It may seem \u201cchildish\u201d to some, but we live in a society that likes to crush anything that doesn\u2019t directly contribute to exploitation in the name of capitalism, even if it\u2019s for themselves.) I sincerely wish you both the best, and I\u2019m hoping this comment can at least provide some insight at the minimum.

It\u2019s one thing to be a slob but leaving your bloody used hygiene products on the floor instead of the trash and rotting food is way beyond slob. I would contact her parents again and get more details because untidy doesn\u2019t begin to describe it. Maybe have her mother come and stay with you but not tell her.

I struggle with bipolar type 2, ADHD that I can't currently be medicated for, depression, and anxiety. The depression makes it very hard to motivate myself to do anything. Yes, the state of my house makes my depression and anxiety worse, but it's still very hard to make progress. Also, ADHD has executive dysfunction as a symptom. Which means that even when I want to get up and do the thing, sometimes I can't. It's like flicking a switch to a light with a broken bulb. No matter how many times you flick the switch, the light isn't going to turn on. I can mentally make the decision to get up and put dishes away (flicking the light switch) but somewhere between making the choice and actually doing it something goes haywire, and I end up not being able to (light doesn't turn on). \n\nFor me, my house being cluttered and messy (and yes, sometimes downright dirty) isn't an issue of being lazy. It's an issue of not being able to. That said, I know it's not okay to live this way. I know both I and my kids deserve better. I've been through therapy. I've been told by therapists that I'm fine and have all the skills I need to learn and just need to use them. I'm on meds for the depression and migraines. If I could afford someone to come in once or twice a week to clean, I would jump at that chance, but I'm on disability and raising three kids as a single mom. Hiring someone just isn't in my budget. \n\nBecause of the medical and mental health issues that prevent me from cleaning, being called lazy hurts. It implies it's a choice when it's not. It implies that some part of me wants to live this way. It implies that I am the problem and not the mental health struggles. It dismisses those struggles in their entirety, and leaves me feeling unseen and unheard. \n\nAll that said, she may not be lazy. But she may be. Have you talked to her about why this happens? Literally use the question why. But not as a method to attack. As a method to understand. I can almost guarantee that it will help her understand as well. And if you can both learn why this happens then you have a much better chance of helping her correct the issue. If her reason why is that she simply doesn't care, is actually lazy, and has no desire to change, then you have a choice to make. You have to decide if you can accept that this is how things are or not. If not, you have to figure out a way to change the situation (hiring a cleaner for example) or leave the situation.

At the same time you might need to consider if this job and the Army as a employer are really right for you and your wife. \n\nI mean i'm sure your job is hard but sitting in a empty house can't be easy for her. Does she have much of a social life or is she just burying her self in work?

If she doesn't want to take care of herself and her mental health there is nothing you can do. Everybody is responsible for their own mental health and if she won't do anything you have to take measures to protect your own.

Add to that, if OP is spending all the time he's home cleaning, what time is he spending with his wife? Are they getting any \"date time\" in? OP's wife might be feeling neglected not only because OP is gone for long periods of time, but also ignores her when he IS home, in favor of tidying up the house.

We briefly discussed the possibility of adoption or fostering and eventually decided we'd be okay just us two.", "That sounds like it's the root cause of the problem right there. It's probably not fun living alone and loneliness can be a real drain on anyone who isn't used to it. She's also saying the house is too big, which probably translates to it being overwhelming to clean. Life is a little too much for her and she needs professional help. \n\nThrowing teabags on the wall and leaving sanitary products on the floor is not normal and is a sign of a severe underlying mental health condition. Give her your time and love and get her the help she needs.", "I struggle with depression and anxiety, sounds like your wife does too. When I was single and in my apartment I was worse but I\u2019d get tired of it and spend a few hours cleaning. Now that I\u2019m married and I too have a husband who works away a lot, never more than 3 weeks at a time,it\u2019s made me better because when he\u2019s coming home I know I have to set aside a few hours to mop, do bathrooms, vacuum, fresh bedding. \n\nThe understanding is he doesn\u2019t think about me being messy while he\u2019s gone as long as the house is clean when he comes home. Maybe try something like this. My husbands a very clean person, I\u2019m not and it works for us. Does she work? What about having someone clean the house?", "Whatever the problem is - my guess is mental issues, but in that area it could be a lot of different things, from my own experience I lived somewhat like that with undiagnosed ADHD and untreated depression - anyway, whatever the problem, **she has to recognize it as a problem** if anything is going to change.\n\nIt sounds like she really, really needs help, but it also sounds like she really, really doesn't think there's a problem, and those two things are pretty much incompatible.\n\nYou can't help someone who doesn't think there's a problem. All the people saying \"drag her to therapy\" see that there's a problem, but someone who's dragged to therapy against their will isn't going to have successful therapy sessions. \n\nSo you have to make some decisions, and they're not going to be easy ones. You may need to tell her that you cannot live like this, even if she thinks she can; that something needs to change, and it could be her going to therapy or it could be you leaving, but it cannot keep going like this. \n\n(There is a difference between a statement of consequences and an ultimatum. You are saying \"I cannot live like this; if we can come up with a solution, great, but if we can't, I will need to separate for my own mental health.\" That's absolutely legitimate.)\n\nIf you want to try and convince her it's a problem, and she says it's fine, maybe ask her about inviting friends over. Is she ashamed? If so, why, if she insists it's fine to live like this? (Also, the less she spends time with friends the worse her mental issues are likely to get, so it's a vicious cycle.) Does she mind if you send pictures of the house to someone? Again, if so, why? \n\nBut you may only upset her and still not get through to her, she will say she can live like this just fine, and that's where you have to decide if *you* can live like this or not. \n\nBecause if she doesn't see there's a problem, you only have two choices: accept this, or leave. Maybe leaving will be a wake up call to her, but maybe it won't. But she needs help - much more help than you are able to give, even if you were home all of the time. \n\n.\n\nI'll also note that yes, she probably is better when you're around more, because most of us with mental illnesses do a certain amount of \"masking\" (concealing symptoms) when others are around, and yes, that does include making an effort to clean when you really really really don't want to. So your being in the military is exacerbating the issue, but it's NOT the cause - it's just that you're seeing what happens when she's not masking.", "I mean your last sentence right there says a lot.\n\nWhat do YOU get out of this relationship? It just seems like it's very one sided and you're acting like a care taker.", "And the damages to the landlord....", "speaking with no data whatsoever to back me up i'll say that the single largest contributor to this kind of persistent behavior is long term depression.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nget her to a psychiatrist for a check up and go find a relationship counselor to talk about things like this on your next leave.  the method in which you are communicating is not conducive to actual progress in your relationship. if you guys keep talking things through like this and they keep ending in a blow up and resentment, you're going to fall apart regardless of who's actually \"right\" or \"wrong\" about the whole cleaning up thing or any other issue you might be trying to fix.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nthe communication is the core issue. fix that and the rest will fall in line. counseling works, try it.", "Her behavior is only going to get worse as time goes by.

Having parents that say 'she has always been untidy' is not an excuse.\n\nYou're so NTA but please try to get her some help.  Good luck", ">I started finding used sanitary products on the bathroom floor rather than in the bin. \n\nI had to put my phone down. That's vile.", "Pads on the floor is disturbing. Get a divorce.", "Her argument is she cant keep up with the housework in a large house and work at the same time. \n\nYou have no kids. \n\nYou are on leave. \n\nIt is her mess. She made her own mess and is now using that as an excuse why she cant clean up. \n\nNTA but she needs therapy, at least. You might want to reconsider this marriage.", "NTA\n\nAll issues aren't automatically mental illness. She's always been like this. The used sanitary products on the floor is disgusting. A lot of it is gross. Even if it is mental illness? She has to decide its a problem, get help and do the work. You cannot make her or do it for her. You have to decide if you can continue on like this, or not. You can offer the resources available for mental Healthcare, but you have to decide what you can handle.", "It seems like your wife has a real mental health issue from what you say. It could be depression or OCD or not coping with living alone - it seems like it's getting worse anyway.\n\nDid she grow up in a dirty house? Not from what you say. If she's alone in the house and out to work all day, then it shouldn't be hard to keep it clean and tidy.\n\nTherapy to get to the root of the problem is probably better than just stating your requirements. If she refuses therapy of some kind, you will have to make a choice.", "I agree this isn't laziness it is something deeper.  It could be mental illness or depression or even ADHD which can make cleaning seem overwhelming.  It is difficult to say from our armchairs.\n\nBut it would be reasonable to start with a visit to the doctor and maybe a therapist to explore what is going on.  If you could afford it maybe hiring a housekeeper for a couple of days a month might help keep things in a bit of order and not so overwhelming.\n\nAll that said, used sanitary napkins laying on the floor might be a breaking point for me..", "Doesn't sound like she's working. Cmon you can be expected to put a couple hours a week making sure the house is clean", "Question. You don\u2019t have kids with this woman - you don\u2019t see her very often and it sounds like you\u2019re just sort of worried about her most of the time and she treats your home like a trash heap. Why are you with her? Seems like you\u2019re not getting much out of this relationship.", "INFO: Have you offered to help clean or have someone else come in to clean while you're not there? If so, how did she react?", "NAH and this probably goes against the grain but here\u2019s why:\n\nOn her side- it sounds like she might be dealing with depression or ADHD- has she ever gotten assessed for this? My husband is also military and I know deployments can be hard on both spouses, especially if you\u2019re away from family and friends. It sounds like she might need some mental health support or therapy. \n\nOn your side: it\u2019s understandable to be upset about the house being messy, especially with sanitary products on the ground. I don\u2019t think calling her lazy was the best way to go about it, but I\u2019m not going to call you an AH for that because it makes sense that you were upset. \n\n\nOverall, there seems to maybe be something else going on with her aside from just laziness and it sounds like she needs some support in that.", "As someone with severe anxiety on a waitlist for an ADHD diagnosis who is currently living in a complete mess during a stressful week of back-to-back job interviews, my heart is full seeing the comments suggesting mental illness and adhd. People who struggle with keeping their living environment neat often get judged so harshly when in my case I really can't help it, my brain is burnt out from the interview prep and stress, the clothes on the floor and dishes in the sink just don't feel like a priority, even though they do bother me. We don't need judgment, just help <3 Although I do agree that OP's wife needs to seriously seek help this is not normal", "NTA.  She\u2019s lazy.  Clean a whole big house?  It\u2019s only her mess she has to clean up.  Literally just picking up after herself.  But yeah, she has some mental issues.  Suggest counseling or find a better living arrangement before kids appear in the picture.", "NTA. I'm sorry you're going through this. No one wants to come home to that type of environment. I agree with everyone else, though. Even if she's always been like this, it seems like something is wrong. \n\nI used to be that unhygienic and it was definitely a mental health issue. \n\nYou've talked to her about it, though. It seems like you've done everything right so far. Maybe be more honest with your feelings. Frame it differently. Try to come up with solutions together to tackle the problem. Reiterate therapy, maybe hire a cleaner once a month if you can afford it. \n\nIf she doesn't change and it bothers you that much, you might need to reevaluate.", "Send a cleaning crew in once a month, even if you have to take a second job to do it. It's unbelievable how much just a helping hand matters.", "Is she neurodivergent and co-dependent on you? You being gone might be harder on her than you think. \n\nNTA, but a gentle hand and trying to help will go a long way. I think you handled it well, but her defensive reaction and just how bad she gets when you\u2019re gone tells me there\u2019s more to the story, especially with her parents saying she\u2019s \u201calways been like this.\u201d\n\nSome of the advice in here is a bit harsh. Come from a place of love and understanding and that should help.", "Tell her to have a thyroid function test done. She could be just exhausted.", "Either pay to have cleaners regularly show up or divorce her. She's not going to change.", "NTA.   Either she gets therapy or you get a divorce.   If she won't help herself then she will just drag you down.", "NTA . If she won't seek therapy and or refuses to change her hygiene, I'd really reconsider staying with her. It's disgusting you have to ask her to clean up . Like you said it doesn't need to be spotless but there shouldn't be plates with food laying around (it brings bugs), trash on the ground(also brings bugs), & -this especially shouldn't even have to be asked /said -dirty, used , bloody sanitary products shouldn't be thrown on the floor instead of the trash \ud83d\ude37. Instead of trying to change she just gets defensive and seems happy when you leave again. What kind of life partner is that or home is that to go to ?", "It was the used sanitary napkins left on the floor for me!  That's enough for divorce.  That's not \"lazy.\"  That's just nasty!", "> Lazy people don't always fold their laundry right away. Lazy people might have a few extra dishes in the sink\n\nI feel attacked.", "I agree to this. She needs to go to the dr could be anxiety/depression and or add. My husband probably could of made this same post years ago , not to that extreme but to a certain extent but we did have 3 young kids at the time. I finally got put on anxiety and add meds which have helped out a lot.", "If you can afford it, why not pay for someone to come and clean your home? The reality is that she\u2019s not an orderly person: we don\u2019t know whether it\u2019s from \u201claziness\u201d (so judgemental, btw); mental illness; neurodivergence; all of the above or none of the above. Work with this reality and outsource the cleaning. If you love her and want to build a life together, this is a classic \u201cthrow money at the problem\u201d situation. Otherwise, it\u2019s a pretty fundamental incompatibility and understandable that you don\u2019t want to live like this. YTA for calling her lazy instead of working with her as a team (or breaking up as a team) to find a realistic solution.", "Get her assessed for adhd", "That's just normal. You're normal not lazy.", "There's a difference between cluttered but clean and cluttered but filthy. Leaving food out to go moldy and bloody pads/tampons on the bathroom floor goes beyond being an untidy home and full on into a filthy home.", "Important question to ask here too", "Yes, OP. Your wife sounds like a hoarder. She is hoarding trash. I couldn't stay in a relationship like that."]}
