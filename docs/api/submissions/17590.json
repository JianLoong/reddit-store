I know that for a lot of us, that a disrespectful attitude would have never been tolerated by the people who raised us and it gives us almost a hairpin trigger to see it displayed before our eyes. I know that I\u2019m in a constant battle to not respond to my children the way I was responded to when I was growing up. Is OP displaying appropriate behavior? No, but there could be deeper issues here than we can gauge with just this one post. Parents are responsible for setting boundaries with their children and teaching them to be respectful. And the best way to do that is to display the appropriate behavior ourselves. \u201cDo as I say, not as a do\u201d is not a thing anymore.

OP, telling your parent to shut up is quite obviously going to have a negative impact, and I think you knew that when you said it and then proceeded to repeat it. Maybe you have some big feelings about your father, or something else that surfaced in that moment and you felt frustration and lack of control over your emotions. You may feel like an adult a lot of the time, but you are still very young. You are still growing, in mind and body. You have a lot of maturing to do and can benefit from the guidance of adults that you trust, whether it be your parents or others. If you have a fairly good relationship most of the time, do your best to get along with your dad while you\u2019re still home and enjoy the rest of your childhood. You\u2019ll be all grown up before you know it. \nIf you don\u2019t, try and stay positive.

You call yourself a good kid. See, my 19 year old is a good kid, and one of the reasons that I know this is that he has never told me to shut up, or laughed at me when I was upset with him. You\u2019re not \u201cbasically an adult,\u201d he is legally responsible for you, which makes you a minor living under his roof, and subject to his house rules. It\u2019s not your bedroom door you were fixing, it\u2019s his, see. I don\u2019t know why he wanted you to stop fixing it, there\u2019s context missing there, but that would help. \n\nAnyhow, I guess because you\u2019re \u201cbasically an adult\u201d he can\u2019t stop you from going out, that\u2019s true enough. Just like you couldn\u2019t stop me from changing the internet password at home, and removing the data package from your phone plan, if I were your parent. I guess you can play your game and find out what he\u2019ll do.

Good luck to you. \n\nAlso, YTA, kid.\n\nETA: I read through some comments, I see you broke your door, I\u2019m going to guess by slamming it, and your dad was yelling at you because he wanted you to fix the door.

A lot of the \"arrogance\" people associate with teenagers is really just young adults trying to set boundaries with parents who aren't yet ready for that.\n\nI think you did about as well as you could have. You are at the age where a smart father would start trying to negotiate with you rather than make decrees.

The fact he  comes home from work and starts shouting immediately makes me suspect this guy is not necessarily hitting it out of the park in terms of fatherhood.\n\nOne thing I would suggest you consider: just because your father is acting like a jerk doesn't make it okay for you to do the same. At some point, you need to hold yourself to a higher standard than the (fairly low) one he sets for himself. It's shockingly easy for men who resent their father to turn into him anyway. (There have been some great movies made about this, including both *Star Wars* and *The Godfather*.)

No Dad can\u2019t take clothes, and a roof, and food, and safety from the kid. That\u2019s neglect and with the safety possibly straight up abuse. \n\nAnd it\u2019s not going to do any good. The kids going to turn 18 in the next year or so. \n\nAnd save the snarky terms of endearment for until after you gain reading comprehension, Honey. It\u2019s a much better look that way.", "You can be reported for neglect if you take all his clothes away, and you should be reported.", "\"shut up\" isn't cussing. And respect goes both ways. It's not just blindly given. As a parent it is the obligation to provide the aforementioned basics, otherwise you chose to have kids just to neglect their basic needs. They both blew up and acted immaturely instead of having a very simple conversation. ESH.", "Also, I feel like people are missing the fact that OP was being berated before he snapped.", "Right so many kids these days and young adults are SO entitled. We are all lucky in the scenario of parent and child to have one another and a lot act like their parents are disposable. I\u2019m not kicking my kids out at 18\u2026. But it\u2019s also still the home I pay the bills for therefore I am the one who enforces the rules and one of those rules is we respect each other and as long as you\u2019re a child under my roof if you CUSS as me then you\u2019re grounded\u2026 and if you\u2019re an adult under my roof and you cuss at me then we may need to discuss boundaries and if living together is the appropriate course. That simple.", "Notice: Nothing about how often their kids talk to them anymore post-moving out lol", "People who deserve respect receive it. Simply having your gametes meet another person's gametes does not magically endow you with respectability. I'm so glad you're happy with yourself, though - you'll need it later, I'm sure.", "Of course. And that's why there are mandated reporting laws. So they get the support needed.\n\nI was just curious as to what parents OWE kids that you tell them. \nLove. Shelter. Food. Values. Limits and structure. \n\nI love that I get down voted but really I'm just curious.", "That should always be our goal. Do better than our parents.", "Yeah, the exact exchange my siblings and I have had with my parents hundreds of times growing up", "*Chefs kiss*", "But he didn\u2019t threaten to take those things? He just said he\u2019d ground him or take the phone. I can agree that the phone thing might be too much but he\u2019s the parent - grounding isn\u2019t abuse nor is it wrong to use on a teenager.\n\nHe told his son not to tell him to shut up and the son did again and is clearly being disrespectful.\n\nThe dad shouldn\u2019t yell or get in his face but it\u2019s the dads house - he DOES get to make rules.", "Perfection", "All a confusion of them remembering a similar situation when they were young. People in real life know social cues. People on Reddit don\u2019t. If somebody is giving short answers or has a disinterest tone, either disengage or just watch. Not a parenting tip but just an assumption of how the conversation was going with OP and father. Main question is why did OP feel the NEED to go to that level? We see it all the time with kids having to keep their activities more secretive as their parents go nosier and nosier. OP resorted to that way of speaking when his regular options were not working.", "Only thing they're writing about is money, so... yeah. One of those. And someone who writes paragraphs in multiple comments to protest about how amazing-sparklemagic a parent they are.", "Parents have a responsibility to provide their children with housing, food, and safety. Those things are mandatory.", "Parents do owe kids shelter, food, and clothing. They owe them love too.\n\nIt's sad that you believe that CPS calls are enough. I've called 3 times for the same kid. I have colleagues that have called every day for weeks. Sometimes all we can impart is the mantra a kid needs to survive the abuse until adulthood.", "Because I'm pretty sure doors don't break on their own, I'm guessing you had something to do with it breaking? \ud83e\udd14", "You broke the damn door \ud83d\udc80", "Not the most adult response. I thought you were responsible?", "Where did I say CPS calls are enough? I literally said that the students can get support and resources. I literally said parents owe them love, shelter, food and clothing. \n\nWhy are you being combative when I never once said what you're implying?", "My cousins were hard-core door slammers and definitely broke a few doors. But this was \"in need of anger management\" type slamming. They've also punched holes in the doors and had cocky attitudes like OP.", "> And that's why there are mandated reporting laws. So they get the support needed.\n\nNot who you were replying to, but you kind of did, right there. The sad truth is reporting abuse almost never gets kids the support and resources they need.", "I didn't say that was enough. The poster is speaking about students. There are laws that we have. It doesn't mean that's the end of the line and that's all we do. It takes a village is a saying for a reason.\n\nAnd you're sadly right. It isn't enough to get the support. But people involved can do more. \n\nI also acknowledge their role in those situations by saying \"of course\" in reply to them telling abused children their statement."]}
