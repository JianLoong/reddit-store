OP is an AH but a parent's job is to provide those things for their kids, even when the kid is acting like an entitled brat. That's what happens when you have kids.  They shouldn't be used as leverage in some very immature, on both sides, power play", "Was with you until you started using things parents are morally and legally obligated to do as some sort of leverage and pissing contest of who does more.

So much stuff you never think about having to have.", "He blamed me for breaking it so I just fixed it because I don't want him in my room", "Lmao.

I don\u2019t think, so. Does he pay his phone bill he\u2019s 17 I don\u2019t think he can sign a contract at 17 so I don\u2019t think he pays his own phone bill so there are plethora of ways that Dad could punish that disrespectful ungrateful little brat", "Yeah, my state gives parents basically no way to control 16 or 17 year olds. Physical force is technically allowed but I've heard the state rarely feels it is justified.\n\nIn states like Texas corporal punishment of 17 year olds is allowed though so his dad could legally hold him down and beat him with a belt. And if he punched his dad for that his dad could probably call the cops.", "Based on OP's post I don't really trust anything they say.", "Maybe he did fix it and the kid keeps breaking it. Funny he doesn\u2019t say why the door was broken.", "OP says his dad was busy. He likely didn\u2019t want to wait for his father to fix it, and could\u2019ve been breaking it or making a lot of noise.

Superb acting to this day!", "100% I've had to tell students this same shit. \"Your parents are adults and that means THEY are responsible for THEIR actions and they OWE you not the other way around.\" Raising kids to be grateful ends up making them feel worthless if you do it wrong.

This kid needs to remember where he came from and to have some respect.", "Not if the kid broke the door...", "OP didn't say his dad made him fix it, nor why he was being \"yelled\" at, or how the door got broken for that matter.

But OP is at the point where he\u2019s almost out. Ideally he\u2019ll see sense and have an adult conversation with dad. Hopefully OPs description of his dads parenting is exaggerated so OP has someone who can teach him to have adult conversations without resorting to childish displays of temper, as shown by both parties if things happened exactly as written. \n\nBased on the post, ESH, but really I\u2019d just say it\u2019s a kid being a kid and a dad not clearly thinking through his show of force.", "Comments like yours make me so glad my mom apologizes to me everyday for how she treated me growing up.", "You sound like a controlling AH.", "> OP didn't say his dad made him fix it\n\nhe now has added a comment saying he did", "[deleted]", "Why would I break it?", "In a different part of the thread OP gets pressed about who broke the door and repeatedly tries to dodge the question then just stops answering when no one buys his weak responses.

You are no longer a child. You are not an adult yet, but you are no longer a child, I don\u2019t know where you live and honestly your parents must have extreme patience. My parents by now would\u2019ve turned off. My phone would\u2019ve made me get a job and pay rent. You are lucky to have a family that puts up with BS. You are not a slave chipping in and doing household chores that\u2019s not slavery, they also are not required to pay you for the chores you do if some parents do that great awesome not every parent is required to do that you are 17 start acting like it", "Then leave.", "Jesus the dramatic entitlement", "Wait until you get your own place and realize you do nothing at home in comparison.", "Then gtfo", "They're an enthusiastic asshole and failed to realise that's supposed to be a fun flair, not reality.", "And he has now also said his dad told him to fix it because he broke it.", "I think the kid has 2 accounts and he\u2019s trying to stick up for himself with 2 throwaways lol", "What are you talking about?
