Sarah held a party at her house, and I decided to stay and help her clean up and stay the night, which turned out to be a big mistake. For context, Jake has always been weird towards me, making comments about my appearance every time I was near him for years, even after I tried telling him that I was gay. I've been out to my friends and parents for a year, but my parents never fully accepted it and grew distant after I told them.\n\nEventually, after cleaning up, I sat down on the couch, and he decided to sit next to me and start talking. At first, we discussed normal topics like school, but it quickly turned to my love life. I already saw where this was going but thought it would be rude to change the topic or leave. As expected, he asked if I had a boyfriend, and I said no. He then said he liked me and asked me out. I politely told him no, and he responded , \"My life would be so much easier if I were gay; then, I wouldn't get rejected by girls.\"\n\nI immediately blew up on him, saying that he was lucky he never had to experience not being able to tell parents about a crush that they asked about because they thought it was gross, or not being able to introduce them to a partner because he knew that they would always want them to be of the opposite gender.I went on to mention more things but at this point I was crying and stoped. He just sat there shocked and didn't say anything, so I just left and went home.\n\nThe next morning, I received texts from Jake's friends saying that I was an asshole for breaking Jake's heart and blowing up on him. I haven't responded yet. I don't know if I should feel bad or not. Jake purposely interrupted me anytime he flirted with me, and I tried to tell him that I was gay, but I probably shouldn't have blown up on him. AITA?\n\n\n\n\nContext and Update \nI feel like I need to provide more context regarding multiple things in the situation.\n\nFirstly, regarding Jake, I'm not sure if he knew I was gay. He has been flirting with me for years, and when I told him I wasn't interested, he persisted. I started hinting that I was gay, but that didn't stop him. When I outright told him, he still continued to flirt with me. Maybe he doesn\u2019t accept it, but I don't really know. Since then, I have tried to tell him every time he flirts with me, but he interrupts me every time. Additionally, this is not the first time he's similar remarks and has even made some homophobic comments and jokes, but I've always been afraid to say anything.\n\nSecondly, regarding me and why Jake's remark made me blow up on him, coming out was a difficult thing for me. I lost a lot of people, and the people who hurt me the most were my parents. For context, my parents have always been very involved in my life, so losing them was very difficult. I've been in therapy for a while, but it's still a very sensitive topic for me. After Jake made remarks like this before, and being genuinely a pain to me, I was at my breaking point.\n\nNow for an update. I talked to Sarah about the whole ordeal, and she told me that Jake talked to her about it but didn't mention his  remark. Instead, he said that I had led him on and that I was a bitch for making him think I liked him and then cruelly rejecting him. Sarah already knew that I didn't like him and that I was gay, so she didn't believe him. She also confronted his friends and told them to leave me alone, along with some not-so-kind words. Besides that, I haven't done anything because I've been dealing with family issues. I'm sorry I don't have a big update, but thank you for all the advice, and I'll keep you updated.", "created_utc": 1682665544, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/131kbs2/aitah_for_blowing_up_on_friends_brother_after_he/", "score": 2439, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Jake and his friends are delusional \u2014 what did they think you were going to do, pretend you weren\u2019t gay so that Jake could go out with you? Nonsense. There was never even going to be a glimmer of hope you\u2019d feel the same way about him because he\u2019s a man and you\u2019re *a gay woman.* If Jake\u2019s friends are saying that you were an asshole for breaking his heart, then in some way they hold you responsible but you must understand that you are *not;* you\u2019re not responsible for someone else\u2019s feelings.

I would\u2019ve lost my patience at the same point. As a gay woman myself I\u2019ve been in this very same position and honestly, sometimes being absolutely blunt about it is the only way that the message will get through. I\u2019ve had men flat out disbelieve me, tell me they could turn me straight (as if it was some kind of switch), or that I just hadn\u2019t found the right man, etc. Sometimes the bluntness is necessary and it sounded like it was in this case.\n\nAnd maybe Jake doesn\u2019t want to hear it but perhaps it is his personality that means he\u2019s getting rejected by girls.

Just sayin...", "NTA but don\u2019t hold a grudge. He seems immature, ignorant and as someone with a low self worth. Is he amazing friend potential? No. But your reaction also seems a little over the top. Not completely unwarranted but. A bit much. But it might be that we use the word \u201cblew up\u201d differently. To me it seems escalating.

Though I do believe there is some merit to getting in the door easier so to speak, I've always been friendly and nice so skewed a bit. When you're dating guys it just is in my eyes easier to find someone good when guys are more forward and you get twenty messages and weed them out, versus giving someone attention and a chance just because they are the only person that messaged you back.\n\nBut the amount of actual dating material clicks isn't actually much higher just a small bit.\n\nAs a straight guy nearly 100% of women that engaged me in conversation were dates, good times and at least friends. As a gay guy like 80% just want to fuck if not a bit more. And then dating as a trans gal now I think its 99% just want to fuck and I'm back to the same odds as when a straight dude for finding someone I click with.\n\nBut the vastly different replies and at least casual dates do make things feel super skewed until you realise its just as hard meeting someone you click with. The alienating feeling of struggling to even get someone to hang is something I haven't forgot, when now being trans and not anything special I could still get a date on any given night if I wasn't taken. But that doesn't reallt mean anyone is going to love me if I were a shitty person to others, just means you meet the much lower barrier for initial meets. But I don't feel totally chill compleltley disregarding how much easier it is to meet people, even if attributing your failings to not having that option is gross. \n\nLike most things in life being x way is better in some ways and worse in others and not a uniform thing. \n\nBeing able to meet cute guys whenever and narrow dating choices down and end up with better partners is pretty sweet. Losing the majority of my family over my identity, never feeling safe outside alone, making my own medication as its gatekept but transphobic systems, being judged constantly... not really worth just meeting guys easier lol.

He either thinks she isn\u2019t actually gay, thinks it was just a phase, or he can\u2019t accept her orientation and so he asks if she has a boyfriend to try to invalidate her sexuality.\n\nHopefully my explanation made sense, that\u2019s my interpretation of it anyway.", "Ok, then we just see it differently.

When we go out and *try* to find a date, we are inherently trying to start a relationship before we have actually established these things, and then trying to force them to happen. The end result of this is a lot of unhappy relationships between people who only admire each other's appearances, with nothing in common other than a desire to not be single.\n\nInstead, take the time and energy you would spend on trying to find someone to date, and put it into other things that you care about. We, as humans, require social contact, so find groups of people with similar interests to you, and build normal, friendly relationships with them regardless of gender, with no ulterior motives. Find a way to be happy as a single person, because if you don't know how to be happy alone, you will accept things that you shouldn't, and it will distort your relationships.\n\nEventually, you will most likely find someone who you can trust, who you admire, and who has similar goals for their life as you do, and who feels the same way about you.

And most people aren't great at things the first time they do them, so it's not necessarily bad for people to try out low-commitment romantic relationships before they settle down. It gives people more perspective and context for what feels good and healthy, what feels bad and unhealthy, and it helps them get a sense of their personal quirks and what's unique about any given partner versus just the standard foibles of a relationship.\n\nI think you perspective is probably informed from either experiencing in or watching people rush into unhealthy relationships, and there's something to be said for chilling out and letting things happen, but I'm not sure you realize that you're advocating for people never to date until they maybe find their One True Love, which is actually pretty regressive. People, especially women, are often much more vulnerable in their first relationship, and it's actually to their benefit to have some past experiences before committing their life to someone, no matter how much they feel their goals align. Time can't grant experience if you never experience anything, and while some maturity will come naturally, and platonic relationships can help inform some aspects of romantic relationships, I think very few people are romantically mature enough for a lifelong commitment in their first relationship.", "It's hard, because if you're trying to be good, and listening to women on the internet (which, I want to be clear, is very much a good thing), it's never acceptable to ask someone out if they're in any setting that's not intentionally set up to broadcast that they're waiting to be asked out, but I think there's a bit more nuance there.\n\nOne thing is that if you make hard and fast rules like that, you're trying to account for the lowest common denominator, I.E. hopelessly delusional men that assume every smile is an invitation.\n\nYou *aren't* the lowest common denominator. You're sensitive, chill, and easily willing to take no for an answer. You can probably afford to trust your judgement that there's chemistry more than you might have been led to believe. From what you've said, you can be trusted to know non-creepy ways to ask women out, even in less obvious situations. A classic is to leave a phone number on your receipt, so that you're not putting in-the-moment pressure on a server/barista/whatever, but giving them the opportunity to reach out if they feel like it.\n\nThe other big thing is, find a hobby/past time, and do it consistently. Become a regular, familiar face. the thing that's hard is, you can't only be there to hit on women, or it *does* become creepy. But if you're doing something fun and social, and you talk to people while there, and then eventually you happen to be talking to a woman and hit it off, and after a few times of seeing her you're like \"Hey, no pressure, but would you like to get coffee sometime?\" that's completely different from the \"mining a hobby club for dates\" that you've undoubtedly heard complaints about.\n\nI think possibly, in trying to be good, you've talked yourself out of all but the most forced opportunities for dating (in which people are going to have the highest standards, since they're faced with a veritable buffet of mediocre options, and, and I think this is actually pretty under recognized, *people that are bad candidates for relationships will be overrepresented*. Seriously, I think bars and apps are going to be full of serial fuckboys, social misfits, and people with weird expectations. People that are good candidates for dating are usually already in relationships, and if they aren't, they're usually not actively looking for them for too long. The \"regulars\" at bars and on dating apps are going to be people that have been trying for a long time to find someone to date, and failing. Some of them, like you, it might be through no fault of their own, but women are going to have their hackles up, and the chances of finding a reasonable, chill person to just hang out with are going to be lower).\n\nWow that was an insanely long parenthetical. Sorry for that crime against formatting.\n\nAnyway, it sounds like you have great intentions, and decent chances, but your instincts are probably tuned a bit too cautious, because again, and this is actually great and will work out in your favor in the long run, you spend a lot of time trying to listen to women. I would ask your friends if they have any friends to set you up with, or ask out someone you keep running into at like the bookstore or coffee shop or whatever that you thought you had decent chemistry with, but didn't want to be a creep. If they're not into it just be extra chill and give them space, but don't disappear on them, and you won't have caused any real harm.\n\nAnd if all else fails, people say it's really really effective to either get a dog (you meet people while walking around what want to pet your dog), or to join a hobby that's more popular with women (take up yoga, or I've heard Salsa dancing is really really good for this, since it's all women trying to do something romantic and fun and kind of hot, and at the end of the day you learn how to dance in a cool way). Again, I trust you to be chill enough to not make it weird. There are some men that absolutely should *not* try to find a date in a yoga or salsa class, since they'll spend the whole class staring at the women and end it by standing at the door asking every single woman out one at a time before letting them leave. Take heart that you have the sense not to do that, and can be trusted to be a little more aggressive than you might have thought, as long as you're sensitive, patient, and willing to hear that you overcorrected and need to chill back out.", "Of course I know that even inside the LGBTQ+ community there are toxic dynamics just as in every human community. \n\nIt's just that, from my perspective, the difference in treatment is astounding.\n\nI mean, I'm an hairy, overweight guy who had never been told anything good about his appearence.

I lost a lot of people, and the people who hurt me the most were my parents. For context, my parents have always been very involved in my life, so losing them was very difficult. I've been in therapy for a while, but it's still a very sensitive topic for me. After Jake made remarks like this before, and being genuinely a pain to me, I was at my breaking point.\n\nNow for an update. I talked to Sarah about the whole ordeal, and she told me that Jake talked to her about it but didn't mention his  remark. Instead, he said that I had led him on and that I was a bitch for making him think I liked him and then cruelly rejecting him. Sarah already knew that I didn't like him and that I was gay, so she didn't believe him. She also confronted his friends and told them to leave me alone, along with some not-so-kind words.
