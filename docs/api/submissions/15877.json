Jake and his friends are delusional \u2014 what did they think you were going to do, pretend you weren\u2019t gay so that Jake could go out with you? Nonsense. There was never even going to be a glimmer of hope you\u2019d feel the same way about him because he\u2019s a man and you\u2019re *a gay woman.* If Jake\u2019s friends are saying that you were an asshole for breaking his heart, then in some way they hold you responsible but you must understand that you are *not;* you\u2019re not responsible for someone else\u2019s feelings.

I would\u2019ve lost my patience at the same point. As a gay woman myself I\u2019ve been in this very same position and honestly, sometimes being absolutely blunt about it is the only way that the message will get through. I\u2019ve had men flat out disbelieve me, tell me they could turn me straight (as if it was some kind of switch), or that I just hadn\u2019t found the right man, etc. Sometimes the bluntness is necessary and it sounded like it was in this case.\n\nAnd maybe Jake doesn\u2019t want to hear it but perhaps it is his personality that means he\u2019s getting rejected by girls. Being gay wouldn\u2019t make that easier.", "NTA. He didn\u2019t listen to you. He actively ignored you. Sounds selfish and ignorant. Needed the reality check you gave him.

He isn't at fault your parents are homophobic AH.", "Yeah, I think you need to seek some professional therapy. You are obviously dealing with some issues regarding your orientation and other's acceptance of that.

Just sayin...", "NTA but don\u2019t hold a grudge. He seems immature, ignorant and as someone with a low self worth. Is he amazing friend potential? No. But your reaction also seems a little over the top. Not completely unwarranted but. A bit much. But it might be that we use the word \u201cblew up\u201d differently. To me it seems escalating. He\u2019s not responsible for your parents many flaws and might not be aware of wether you by gay meant bi - again ignorant.

It's a comment that me and my friends said a lot when in his age.  \nYour blowing up comes from your own feelings, and while I feel sorry for you and hope you will find your inner peace (and your parents accept you the way you are), this was more about letting your anger out.", "Yep your the asshole let people think being gay is easy change the stigma don't spread the worry. Even if it a lie. Straight gay bi behind every person's eyes are things going on you have no clue about. Don't be so quick to judge and you should of just laughed and said something like everyone thinks you already are.

Yes, he sounds it from the way you've described it and the whole victim complex thing is annoying as fuck.\n\nI don't get the \"He interrupted me I tried to tell him I was gay\" sounds like you never told him. How could he interrupt you telling him you're gay on purpose if he didn't already know you were gay. Unless he's psychic? \n\nTo me it sounds like he probably didn't actually know you were gay, he's made a comment that he shouldn't have after you've turned down and without realising the implications of what he's said. \n\nBlowing up on him because he said he wishes he was gay? Not an excuse to blow up on somebody. Bit of an over reaction. Especially if he's not aware you're gay.

Though I do believe there is some merit to getting in the door easier so to speak, I've always been friendly and nice so skewed a bit. When you're dating guys it just is in my eyes easier to find someone good when guys are more forward and you get twenty messages and weed them out, versus giving someone attention and a chance just because they are the only person that messaged you back.\n\nBut the amount of actual dating material clicks isn't actually much higher just a small bit.\n\nAs a straight guy nearly 100% of women that engaged me in conversation were dates, good times and at least friends. As a gay guy like 80% just want to fuck if not a bit more. And then dating as a trans gal now I think its 99% just want to fuck and I'm back to the same odds as when a straight dude for finding someone I click with.\n\nBut the vastly different replies and at least casual dates do make things feel super skewed until you realise its just as hard meeting someone you click with. The alienating feeling of struggling to even get someone to hang is something I haven't forgot, when now being trans and not anything special I could still get a date on any given night if I wasn't taken. But that doesn't reallt mean anyone is going to love me if I were a shitty person to others, just means you meet the much lower barrier for initial meets. But I don't feel totally chill compleltley disregarding how much easier it is to meet people, even if attributing your failings to not having that option is gross. \n\nLike most things in life being x way is better in some ways and worse in others and not a uniform thing. \n\nBeing able to meet cute guys whenever and narrow dating choices down and end up with better partners is pretty sweet. Losing the majority of my family over my identity, never feeling safe outside alone, making my own medication as its gatekept but transphobic systems, being judged constantly... not really worth just meeting guys easier lol.

And as a straight dude it pains me to have him among our ranks.", "NTA", "NTA - I am 43F and have been out since I was 16.  I get hit on by a lot of men, my go to response is to say, \u201cWell, thanks for asking - however, you and I are both into the same thing, get it?\u201d - then I see lightbulbs.  The last incident was at the ER at the hospital - was there for active seizure activity and got hit on by the dude next to me who was a mental health patient.  Once I told him the line above he was like, \u201cOh that\u2019s cool I can dig that.  I already have a gf at home.\u201d\n\nAgain, NTA!!!!  My parents were also AH about me being gay as they were very Catholic.  I moved out ASAP at age 17.", "NTA\n\nHave you ever heard about priming a geyser with detergent? This is the same thing, but using really badly chosen words. I don't think the guy was trying to be an AH, but just had no idea how to respond to you, and tried, and failed, to lighten the mood with misplaced humor.", "NTA.  Some guys just can't get a clue.  I really don't know how much more you can say to someone to tell them you aren't interested.  Hope he realizes how big an AH he is and just leaves you alone.", "NTA when will guys learn that women don\u2019t owe them shit in terms of liking them back.", "So you're supposed to say yes to a proposition from someone you don't like, who's not even the same gender you're attracted to bc rejection hurts thier feelings? Ok then if dude's so desperate he should be held to those standards and accept literally any romantic advance directed at him.", "NTA. Leaving aside everything since when did rejecting someone's advances become a wrong thing to do. You had a right to blow up on him after him repeatedly harassing you.\n\nAnd does his friends not know that you're gay. Straight person asking out a gay person is pretty asshole thing to do", "NTA. Dude sucks so much he\u2019d be rejected by everyone, no matter their sexual preferences or gender identity.", "INFO: have you tired dating women?  \nHave you tried dating women as a man?\n\nOver a couple of years I got maybe 40 \"likes\" from women on Tinder, a lot of those were scammers and some were men pretending to be women.  \nI set the same profile to bisexual.\n\nWithin a day I got 100 likes from men.\n\nThere are a lot of different factors and genralising just gives a general not individual picture.  For some aspects, people who are interested in men have it a lot easier.\n\nIn other aspects it's a lot worse.\n\n>I immediately blew up on him, saying that he was lucky he never had to experience not being able to tell parents about a crush that they asked about because they thought it was gross\n\nThis isn't limited to homosexuals, plenty of straight people have this exact experience.\n\n>, or not being able to introduce them to a partner because he knew that they would always want them to be of the opposite gender.\n\nIn some (but much less) cases this also happens too.", "NTA. What he said, especially in you circumstances is hurtful and your response was absolutely understandable. He tried to get pity and instead got what he deserved", "NTA. He didn't accept your boundary the multiple times you set it. He and his friends need to learn to accept rejection.", "NTA. He is not only an asshole,but an idiot.", "NTA - call them a bunch of homophobes, and block them.", "Jake is cute hahaha, he thinks that if he's gay they wouldn't reject him hahahahaha, in the gay community there is a lot of toxicity when it comes to relationships and that's only if we talk about relationships because in other areas many times you have to deal with people who hate you because they have nothing better to do, NTA", " I assume the friends recieved a highly skewed version of events. But even if they didn\u2019t, they are friends of the guy, sooooo\u2026..", "He wouldnt because guys are easy", "Exactly.  It\u2019s really obvious just from this brief description.  \nAlso, his friend sucks, putting that \u201chow dare you break his heart\u201d energy onto OP, for simply declining to date him.  OP doesn\u2019t owe this guy anything!", "According to last paragraph, doesn\u2019t seem she told Jake she was gay, but in any case, NTA", "I wonder what Jake told his buddies though. I can only imagine he told them a sob story.", "She outright told him she was gay.", "Did you skip over the part where this has been going on for a long time and she previously outright told him she\u2019s gay? \n\nWhy is it her responsibility to tiptoe around his delicate feelings forever? She has been clear that she\u2019s not interested in any men, he didn\u2019t listen, continued to annoy her with unwanted attention, and when she finally loses patience with his incredible insensitivity, he cries to his friends who blow up her phone with accusations of cruelty, and you\u2019re saying SHE\u2019s the asshole?? \n\nWay to keep enabling asshole men. We must protect THEIR feelings at all costs. (/s)", "So it\u2019s her fault that he talks over her and won\u2019t let her speak for long enough for her to explain?", "None of that makes her an asshole.", "It's so easy dating being gay that I forgot all the people I lost in my life as a result! /s", "What are you on?", "Her parents are homophobic. No amount of therapy is going to make that not hurt.\n\nYou can be 100% confident in who you are and still be upset that there are people who hate you based on the simple fact of who you are.", "hee hee!", "She could just say \"I'm gay\" how can that be talked over repeatedly. She clearly has no issues shouting. \n\nThey're both assholes.", ">I think this is the main thing straight guys see. \n\nSpeaking on personal experience: being a straight guy who isn't conventionally attractive means it's not exactly easy to provoke interest in a woman, or even receive a compliment.\n\nSo when it happened that gay men hit on me and when it's only gay men who told me I was attractive.....well, honestly I have often regretted not being gay (or at least bisezual) because it would have been easier in SOME aspects.", "  He\u2019s out of his mind with entitlement, avoid being alone with him in the future.", "Have you ever come out to someone?", "Cause idiots like that still wouldn't take that for a answer they would then say things like \"No your not\" or \"Prove it\" so snapping on him was the only way for OP to get him to leave her alone so NTA", "As a lesbian who came out at 19, I can assure you that many guys see \"I'm gay\" as a challenge, not a rejection.", "Correction. He would have still tried to hit on her/ask her out and harass her. You DO understand that men are told \"I'm gay m\" of \"I gave a girlfriend\", \"I'm inab lesbian relationship\" and they proceed to still harass a woman with things like \"you just haven't had the right man\" \"you just need my dick and you wont be lesbian anymore\" \"can I join in the middle\" and so many other variations of this. \n\nOr they get violent, or extremely angry because she's not swooning over his advances and falling at his feet at the mere chance of being with him. Men will and have gotten dangerous when rejected and it increases when it's a woman who is gay. Because they can't grasp and feel it's a personal attack for a woman to prefer another woman over them.\n\nHell being a woman is dangerous regardless because men have proven time and time again that they don't respect NO. (and so have women. They ain't innocent either. But you tend to see more accounts of men in this than women)\n\nShe tried to tell the creepy guy and he refused to allow her to speak and talk. Then instantly tried to aft like being gay was the easiest thing in the world. It's not. Often even in this day and age you will lose friends and family simply because you aren't straight. Jake clearly does not care or cares to know what people apart of the LBGTQIA+ community goes thru if he \"wishes\" he was gay so he wouldnt he rejected. He's be rejected anyways with his mindset.", "I acknowledged, that I might be wrong, but still we don't know. How is it ok to assume, that he's one of those guys, and be downvoted when saying he isn't. There's no indication in either way. \n\nAlso, the core of the problem is not about him asking her out, it's about his dumb \"gays have it easier\" comment and he did not know she's gay.", "Here's a thing, I don't make assumptions, I take facts. A fact is, he did not know, she's gay. All we know is he was \"weird\" which I would guess are his lame attempts of compliments and his obliviousness towards her not being interested. Cause his weirdness is described as commenting her looks. We don't know more.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo while I admit I might be wrong, the thing is, both of us might be right in terms of whether he would or wouldn't have asked her out if he had known about her orientation, the fact still stays this:\n\nHE DID NOT KNOW SHE WAS GAY AND SHE BLEWED UP ON HIM WITH HER OWN ISSUES.\n\nI am fascinated how easily people get to defend her and call him shitty with very little facts over one dumb comment.", "No, those are all just your judgmental assumptions, which I would not be afraid to call blatant sexism. Yes, men can be like that, yet there is exactly 0% indication about any of those, there's nothing about her ever saying there's no chance of romantic endeavor for them.\n\nJust as well the creepy -  he made comments about her looks. How about he was just clueless dumb guy?\n\nWhat are you commenting about is your projection of molesting guy, where literally nothing points that way and not accepting any other explanation as other people here.\n\nAnd again, I agree with that part about LBGT+ people - but his dumb comment wasn't made from malice, but from self pity without the intention of hurting OP. Her blowing up was about her issues, which I sympathize with, but aimed at wrong person.", "I am completely baffled as to how you read the quote \u201ceven after I tried telling him that I was gay.\u201d and thought \u2018*oh, obviously that means it is fact that he didn\u2019t know she was gay. I only collect the facts*\u2019. I am so fascinated as to how you came to the conclusion that \u201che didn\u2019t know she was gay\u201d is a fact. Like. . . where did you get that information from? Are *you* the guy OP is talking about?? Because there is no evidence in this post that proves that he for a fact did not know she was gay."]}
