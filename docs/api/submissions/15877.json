Jake and his friends are delusional \u2014 what did they think you were going to do, pretend you weren\u2019t gay so that Jake could go out with you? Nonsense. There was never even going to be a glimmer of hope you\u2019d feel the same way about him because he\u2019s a man and you\u2019re *a gay woman.* If Jake\u2019s friends are saying that you were an asshole for breaking his heart, then in some way they hold you responsible but you must understand that you are *not;* you\u2019re not responsible for someone else\u2019s feelings.

You can\u2019t help that he had feelings for you \u2014 you rejected him politely, his answering comment was immature and ignorant.\n\nYou shouldn\u2019t feel bad for what you said. I would\u2019ve lost my patience at the same point. As a gay woman myself I\u2019ve been in this very same position and honestly, sometimes being absolutely blunt about it is the only way that the message will get through. I\u2019ve had men flat out disbelieve me, tell me they could turn me straight (as if it was some kind of switch), or that I just hadn\u2019t found the right man, etc. Sometimes the bluntness is necessary and it sounded like it was in this case.\n\nAnd maybe Jake doesn\u2019t want to hear it but perhaps it is his personality that means he\u2019s getting rejected by girls. Being gay wouldn\u2019t make that easier.", "NTA. He didn\u2019t listen to you. He actively ignored you. Sounds selfish and ignorant. Needed the reality check you gave him.

He isn't at fault your parents are homophobic AH.", "Yeah, I think you need to seek some professional therapy. You are obviously dealing with some issues regarding your orientation and other's acceptance of that. Your reaction was WAY out of line. \n\nIf you truly felt confident and comfortable in yourself, you would've been able to handle that a lot more tactfully. Just sayin...", "NTA but don\u2019t hold a grudge. He seems immature, ignorant and as someone with a low self worth. Is he amazing friend potential? No. But your reaction also seems a little over the top. Not completely unwarranted but. A bit much. But it might be that we use the word \u201cblew up\u201d differently. To me it seems escalating. He\u2019s not responsible for your parents many flaws and might not be aware of wether you by gay meant bi - again ignorant.

But blowing up\u2026that\u2019s a bit much in my opinion.", "ESH, while his comment wasn't the best in that situation, but he didn't know you're gay and it was not meant against you. It's a comment that me and my friends said a lot when in his age.  \nYour blowing up comes from your own feelings, and while I feel sorry for you and hope you will find your inner peace (and your parents accept you the way you are), this was more about letting your anger out.", "Yep your the asshole let people think being gay is easy change the stigma don't spread the worry. Even if it a lie. Straight gay bi behind every person's eyes are things going on you have no clue about. Don't be so quick to judge and you should of just laughed and said something like everyone thinks you already are.

Yes, he sounds it from the way you've described it and the whole victim complex thing is annoying as fuck.\n\nI don't get the \"He interrupted me I tried to tell him I was gay\" sounds like you never told him. How could he interrupt you telling him you're gay on purpose if he didn't already know you were gay. Unless he's psychic? \n\nTo me it sounds like he probably didn't actually know you were gay, he's made a comment that he shouldn't have after you've turned down and without realising the implications of what he's said. \n\nBlowing up on him because he said he wishes he was gay? Not an excuse to blow up on somebody. Bit of an over reaction. Especially if he's not aware you're gay.

Though I do believe there is some merit to getting in the door easier so to speak, I've always been friendly and nice so skewed a bit. When you're dating guys it just is in my eyes easier to find someone good when guys are more forward and you get twenty messages and weed them out, versus giving someone attention and a chance just because they are the only person that messaged you back.\n\nBut the amount of actual dating material clicks isn't actually much higher just a small bit.\n\nAs a straight guy nearly 100% of women that engaged me in conversation were dates, good times and at least friends. As a gay guy like 80% just want to fuck if not a bit more. And then dating as a trans gal now I think its 99% just want to fuck and I'm back to the same odds as when a straight dude for finding someone I click with.\n\nBut the vastly different replies and at least casual dates do make things feel super skewed until you realise its just as hard meeting someone you click with. The alienating feeling of struggling to even get someone to hang is something I haven't forgot, when now being trans and not anything special I could still get a date on any given night if I wasn't taken. But that doesn't reallt mean anyone is going to love me if I were a shitty person to others, just means you meet the much lower barrier for initial meets. But I don't feel totally chill compleltley disregarding how much easier it is to meet people, even if attributing your failings to not having that option is gross. \n\nLike most things in life being x way is better in some ways and worse in others and not a uniform thing. \n\nBeing able to meet cute guys whenever and narrow dating choices down and end up with better partners is pretty sweet. Losing the majority of my family over my identity, never feeling safe outside alone, making my own medication as its gatekept but transphobic systems, being judged constantly... not really worth just meeting guys easier lol.

I\u2019m not very good at communicating tone through text.\n\nMy point was mostly that we don\u2019t actually have any evidence that he did or didn\u2019t know she was gay before this situation. The only information that we have is that she tries to tell him she was gay multiple times in the past but he either forgot about it, or he just didn\u2019t care. My perspective is that he probably just didn\u2019t care \u2014 I\u2019ve seen a *lot* of situations where a straight man will disregard a woman telling him she\u2019s gay because he either:\nA. thinks he can \u201cfix\u201d her.\nB. thinks she\u2019s lying.\nC. thinks it\u2019s just a phase and once some time has passed he can flirt with her again and she\u2019ll accept it.\nD. thinks she\u2019s just had bad experiences with men and that she\u2019ll \u201cturn straight\u201d once she realises how good he is.\nE. just straight up doesn\u2019t care\n\nWith the information OP has provided, I\u2019m inclined to believe he probably *did* know she was gay, and just disregarded it for one of the above reasons. Obviously that\u2019s just my personal interpretation but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s an unreasonable interpretation considering OP claimed she\u2019s tried to tell him about her orientation in the past, and that this isn\u2019t a very uncommon situation for gay women to be in.\n\nHim asking her if she had a boyfriend could be for the same reasons. He either thinks she isn\u2019t actually gay, thinks it was just a phase, or he can\u2019t accept her orientation and so he asks if she has a boyfriend to try to invalidate her sexuality.\n\nHopefully my explanation made sense, that\u2019s my interpretation of it anyway.", "Ok, then we just see it differently. If I had thought the same way as you did, I would have agreed. It really is him asking her is she has a BF that makes me think that (my) way, otherwise I would have probably thought also he's one of those \"I can fix\" you people.\n\nBut the way I understand it, is that he just didn't know, and his comment was just a self pity instead of malice. If OP confirms that he in fact did know, it's NTA for me.\n\nThanks for explaining"]}
