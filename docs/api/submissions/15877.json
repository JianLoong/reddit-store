You lost your patience after years of him being annoying, it\u2019s understandable when he\u2019s interrupt you when you were talking and you\u2019ve tried more than once to tell him you were gay.\n\nAnd this is nonsense:\n\n>Jake\u2019s friends saying that I was an asshole for breaking Jake\u2019s heart \n\nYou\u2019re gay. Jake and his friends are delusional \u2014 what did they think you were going to do, pretend you weren\u2019t gay so that Jake could go out with you? Nonsense. There was never even going to be a glimmer of hope you\u2019d feel the same way about him because he\u2019s a man and you\u2019re *a gay woman.* If Jake\u2019s friends are saying that you were an asshole for breaking his heart, then in some way they hold you responsible but you must understand that you are *not;* you\u2019re not responsible for someone else\u2019s feelings. And also, since you\u2019re gay, you never could have been responsible for his heart in the way that he wanted you to be. You can\u2019t help that he had feelings for you \u2014 you rejected him politely, his answering comment was immature and ignorant.\n\nYou shouldn\u2019t feel bad for what you said. I would\u2019ve lost my patience at the same point. As a gay woman myself I\u2019ve been in this very same position and honestly, sometimes being absolutely blunt about it is the only way that the message will get through. I\u2019ve had men flat out disbelieve me, tell me they could turn me straight (as if it was some kind of switch), or that I just hadn\u2019t found the right man, etc. Sometimes the bluntness is necessary and it sounded like it was in this case.\n\nAnd maybe Jake doesn\u2019t want to hear it but perhaps it is his personality that means he\u2019s getting rejected by girls. Being gay wouldn\u2019t make that easier.", "NTA. He didn\u2019t listen to you. He actively ignored you. Sounds selfish and ignorant. Needed the reality check you gave him. Good on you for having the confidence to put him in his place.", "Is he bi?\n\nI'm not so sure if I can say N-T..A because...he said something insensitive, after he was rejected but you reacted not with normal calling out or criticism l, you blew up on him, getting all emotional, crying and yelling and them leaving. \n\nI would say ESH\n\nHe should learn to take rejection better without making snide remarks afterwards and you should learn not to throw your emotional trauma on someone who has nothing to do with it. \n\nHe is not your parent. He isn't at fault your parents are homophobic AH.", "Yeah, I think you need to seek some professional therapy. You are obviously dealing with some issues regarding your orientation and other's acceptance of that. Your reaction was WAY out of line. \n\nIf you truly felt confident and comfortable in yourself, you would've been able to handle that a lot more tactfully. Just sayin...", "NTA but don\u2019t hold a grudge. He seems immature, ignorant and as someone with a low self worth. Is he amazing friend potential? No. But your reaction also seems a little over the top. Not completely unwarranted but. A bit much. But it might be that we use the word \u201cblew up\u201d differently. To me it seems escalating. He\u2019s not responsible for your parents many flaws and might not be aware of wether you by gay meant bi - again ignorant. At the same time you\u2019re perfectly within your rights to educate him and be offended. But blowing up\u2026that\u2019s a bit much in my opinion.", "ESH, while his comment wasn't the best in that situation, but he didn't know you're gay and it was not meant against you. It's a comment that me and my friends said a lot when in his age.  \nYour blowing up comes from your own feelings, and while I feel sorry for you and hope you will find your inner peace (and your parents accept you the way you are), this was more about letting your anger out.", "Yep your the asshole let people think being gay is easy change the stigma don't spread the worry. Even if it a lie. Straight gay bi behind every person's eyes are things going on you have no clue about. Don't be so quick to judge and you should of just laughed and said something like everyone thinks you already are. I know you think your all grown up at 20 but you more then like haven't made it threw a quarter of your life yet.  20 year Olds are not especially now days. Few are at that age. You carry resentment for being judged by your peers and you hate it right so don't do to others what you hate being done to you", "NTA. Jake needs to learn what \u201cno\u201d means & Sarah needs to tell him to back the fuck up. Even if you were straight, his behaviour still wouldn\u2019t be acceptable. Tell his mates to fuck off & worry about their own lives.", "NTA a real \"nice guy\" Isn't he and his friends just love him and care for him so deeply /s throws up immediately... just eww. Don't reply, you aren't in charge of spoiled brat and his oh so precious feelings you did nothing wrong he is ignorant asshat.", "NTA \n\nPersonally, I would respond to his friends: \n\n\"I have been telling Jake that I was gay for YEARS, yet he still continued to pursue me knowing there was zero chance. Jake brought the rant onto himself this time by stating that he would be better off gay so that he wouldn't be rejected by girls and I got upset and told him just a little of how difficult life really is as a gay person. If you are still thinking that Jake is the one in need of sympathy, I ask that you remove my contact information from your phones and never speak to me again.\"", "This. His problem isn't the gender of people he's attracted to, it's his shitty personality.", "Lol he\u2019s basically thinking \u201cI\u2019m not the asshole everyone else is!\u201d\n\nNTA", "I\u2019d say that yeah she was projecting a lot and it wasnt personal to him, OP has a lot of healing and accepting to do. But him playing victim is also a weird move. Ultimately OP you are NTA, I just think you\u2019re hurting and you deserve love and acceptance from those you hold close.", "Jake has been creeping on OP for years (luckily their age gap is minimal, but still it's uncomfortable behaviour). His interest seems only based on OP's looks.\nJake can't take a hint and even actively interrupts OP when she's been trying to come out.\nJake made a vile and unfounded comment that's entirely devoid of empathy and reeks of entitlement. \n\nI don't get where you see low self-worth?\n\nETA Being queer myself, my opinion is that it IS a micro-aggression to expect OP to giggle charmingly and \"educate\" Jake on all the pain and crap we get to deal with just for being who we are.\nOP didn't blow up \"at\" Jake. She experienced yet another moment where she was first harassed as a woman and then invalidated for her queer identity. Jake just sat and gawped in the splash zone of OP's legitimate emotions.", "What the fuck???", "Another entitled \"nice guy\". I am sorry for your brother. You are definitely NTA. I would try to avoid his friend, he sounds like a whiney butthurt homophobe, who sees gay women only as a waste of potential (sexual) partner for him. I bet he treats girls and women around him only as a list of traits, that either suit and compliment him or the opposite. Not as human beings. \n\nI sense Andrew Tate and Jordan Peterson vibes :(.", "NTA In future, please pay more attn when you feel pressured to violate a safety boundary \"to be polite.\" He has consistently ignored your romantic disinterest and lack of consent to pursue a dating relationship. He is angry that real life you is deviating from the script in his head for his imaginary version of a compliant interested heterosexual \"you.\" That's 100% a \"him\" problem. The intensity of his anger and disappointment speaks only to his dedication to his imaginary world and insistence that women bend to align with it.", "NTA. He is and so are his friends. \n\n\"NO\" is a complete sentence. \n\nYou do not owe this guy your heart. It is not your job to manage his feelings.", "NTA, jake probably gets rejected by girls because he doesn't respect them and probably feels like he is owed a gf.", "NTA. Gee. I wonder why he can\u2019t get a date? Dude sounds like a real peach \ud83d\ude44", "I am going against the grain here and say YTA/ESH.\nI would say atleast in blue states it is true. Especially, he will not be as often rejected. To show this is true, just make an account as an average men on Tinder vs Grindr. Tinder is literally skewed if you are not in the Top-20% in terms of looks, while on Grindr you always find somebody who is dtf.", "Is the guy an asshole? Yes, he sounds it from the way you've described it and the whole victim complex thing is annoying as fuck.\n\nI don't get the \"He interrupted me I tried to tell him I was gay\" sounds like you never told him. How could he interrupt you telling him you're gay on purpose if he didn't already know you were gay. Unless he's psychic? \n\nTo me it sounds like he probably didn't actually know you were gay, he's made a comment that he shouldn't have after you've turned down and without realising the implications of what he's said. \n\nBlowing up on him because he said he wishes he was gay? Not an excuse to blow up on somebody. Bit of an over reaction. Especially if he's not aware you're gay. Given the \"tried to tell him\" and \"Purposefully interrupted before I could tell him\"\n\nI'd say you're both the asshole here. But you're just young and these things happen.\n\nBut yeah BTA or YTA", "ESH. You don't need to blow up on him. Most of the time when some blows up before exhausting polite communication, they're being an AH.\n\nHow about: \"If you spent some time understanding what life is like for gay people\u2014myself for example\u2014you would sound like less of an idiot.\"", "Big NTA \n\nYou break the man's heart? Really? Well, he should have stopped his \"flirting\" as soon as you said you were gay. Let's hope he learned his lesson (even if i doubt it) but don't feel bad about what happened.", "NTA. Also (if you feel safe) what about messaging the friends \"I'm a gay woman. Do you not think your friend deserves to be with someone who actually fancies him?\".", "NTA\nHas he met another out gay man? Stereotypes being stereotypes, gay men are way more selective about shit than women when it comes to putting up with gender to bullshit.", "How dare you reject someone you aren't attracted to? NTA obviously... But yeah, he deserved all of that. He sounds so self centred. So sorry your parents aren't being supportive, and I hope in time they will educate themselves and accept you as you are, and ask for your forgiveness.", "NTA\n\nHe\u2019d get turned down by men too.", "Broke his heart? Are we just supposed to never reject guys now?! NTA", "Very much so \ud83d\ude02 my first immediate thought when I read this", "He'd at least have sex though, cause what's all that matters to him. For a lot of inexperienced straight guys the reason they want a girlfriend is because they want to have sex on the regular, like they (think they) deserve. \n\nHe would still encounter the same issues, mainly that his personality would drive people away, and maybe he's got a big dick or is good at sex, that'll be even worse. People would bang him, then just yolo out and only make contact when they want some ass. \n\nEventually he accepts that he is now the meat, and develops an alcohol problem because bartenders are the only ones that say more than 3 sentences to him and also smile.\n\nSauce: former gay-bar tender", "Me, a single bisexual: \ud83d\udc80", "\u201cI just kept crawling and it kept working!\u201d", "Yes.

What did he want you to do, date him for years and years only to find out that his time was wasted because no matter what he tried, you're still just as gay as the day you two met? No. No, no, no. Absolute nonsense. He needs to pull his head out of his not gay as$ and get his terrible personality *straight*ened out and try to have some legitimate relationships with people who are actually likely to be interested in him for who he is. NTA sweetheart, you did nothing wrong. Keep setting and keeping your boundaries", "\u201cJake has always been weird towards me, making comments about my appearance every time I was near him for years, even after I tried telling him that I was gay.\u201d", "> Eventually he accepts that he is now the meat, and develops an alcohol problem because bartenders are the only ones that say more than 3 sentences to him and also smile.\n\nwell that got dark quickly", "I think this is the main thing straight guys see. Though I do believe there is some merit to getting in the door easier so to speak, I've always been friendly and nice so skewed a bit. When you're dating guys it just is in my eyes easier to find someone good when guys are more forward and you get twenty messages and weed them out, versus giving someone attention and a chance just because they are the only person that messaged you back.\n\nBut the amount of actual dating material clicks isn't actually much higher just a small bit.\n\nAs a straight guy nearly 100% of women that engaged me in conversation were dates, good times and at least friends. As a gay guy like 80% just want to fuck if not a bit more. And then dating as a trans gal now I think its 99% just want to fuck and I'm back to the same odds as when a straight dude for finding someone I click with.\n\nBut the vastly different replies and at least casual dates do make things feel super skewed until you realise its just as hard meeting someone you click with. The alienating feeling of struggling to even get someone to hang is something I haven't forgot, when now being trans and not anything special I could still get a date on any given night if I wasn't taken. But that doesn't reallt mean anyone is going to love me if I were a shitty person to others, just means you meet the much lower barrier for initial meets. But I don't feel totally chill compleltley disregarding how much easier it is to meet people, even if attributing your failings to not having that option is gross. \n\nLike most things in life being x way is better in some ways and worse in others and not a uniform thing. \n\nBeing able to meet cute guys whenever and narrow dating choices down and end up with better partners is pretty sweet. Losing the majority of my family over my identity, never feeling safe outside alone, making my own medication as its gatekept but transphobic systems, being judged constantly... not really worth just meeting guys easier lol. Even if that singular aspect of something sounds like it would be easier and especially when that aspect is only a bit better.", "Emphasis on the word \"tried\". She obviously didn't tell him, otherwise he would have not asked her out.", "How exactly do you picture a situation of \u201cI tried to tell him I was gay\u201d going? How would that conversation go without, at some point, the words \u201cI\u2019m gay\u201d coming out?\n\nAlso, that second part is bullshit. There are so many men who don\u2019t give two shits if a woman is gay, they\u2019ll still come onto them."]}
