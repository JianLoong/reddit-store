I believed him. Even though I knew I shouldn\u2019t have about this. He said he\u2019s not watching before just to watch anyways and he doesn\u2019t tell me the truth to spare my \u201cfeelings\u201d basically. We\u2019re both pretty sexual people and even if I get nothing from it, he knows he can ask me for (almost) anything and I\u2019ll (almost) never tell him no. \n\nWe had a rough first couple nights home and I was planning on giving him a little \u201cgift\u201d just because I knew 6 weeks was gonna be hard for me so I knew it would be for him too and we were both stressed already. But of course it came up and he was already irritated with me so he just blatantly told me this time he did it. I got upset and let my insecurities and feelings play into my reaction. I felt disrespected and hurt because he lied to me again after reassuring me. \n\nIf he saying he\u2019s not going to do something and I find out later he is doing that thing but knew I wouldn\u2019t like it from previous conversations then I believe my reaction was pretty reasonable.

Realistically very few people are getting off to their imagination, so they watch a bit of porn and voila, job done and on with your day. It\u2019s nothing deep", "Are you upset about the porn or that he\u2019s having a wank without you? I can kinda understand the porn thing but I think it\u2019s a little unreasonable to expect him to completely abstain for 6 weeks if he doesn\u2019t have to. \n\nCongratulations by the way!", "Nah\n\nYou\u2019re post-partum, sleep deprived and your hormones are going awire. \n\n-> you need to deal with your insecurities. This is a partnership so your partner should I help you out, but you should be holding the brunt of it. You\u2019re saying he is doing nothing to make you insecure but you still are. You can\u2019t take it out on him. This is for you to seek out help for. \n\n-> he was trying to help by saying he would hold off porn, but he realised he was not able to. That\u2019s ok. Same way as someone might say \u201cI\u2019ll stop drinking sodas\u201d or \u201cI\u2019ll read a book a week\u201d or anything. sometimes you take resolutions and you fail then.

(I know you\u2019re forced to not do anything so having support would be nice, but that\u2019s why he hadn\u2019t told you until you bagged him to). \n\n-> you took it out pretty hard on him when you realised he failed. He is never going to come clean again to you over anything if you don\u2019t learn to let minor things go. \n\nAs things are, you need to re-evaluate your expectations. I\u2019m not a man so I don\u2019t know if holding off masturbation for 2 months is possible or not, but he showed you he couldn\u2019t. Accept it. That\u2019s ok, that\u2019s fairly natural I\u2019d say. \nHis needs (if we can call it that?) are not linked to you, so work out on your insecurities and just let this go.", "NTA, he straight up lied to you. all you\u2019re asking for here is honesty. if you had asked him not to and he said he would, and then you were upset about that, id be on his side, but that didn\u2019t happen. he should be honest with you and it\u2019s completely within your rights to be mad that he lied to you. that being said, i wonder if this is less about the porn and more about something else going on behind the scenes? also, probably not the best time to be having big discussions about your relationship when you have a brand new baby keeping you up at night. wait until you start to feel rested again and then have some discussion about this and tell him that you just want him to be honest with you, and if he lies to you and you find out later that he lied, that will hurt your feelings more than if he was just honest in the first place.", "Why are so many people in here acting like watching porn is a cardinal sin\n\nI've seen multiple comments about \"well would you be upset if your girlfriend watched porn!?!??\"\n\nI've never been in a relationship where we both didn't openly watch porn!!\n\nThese comments are crazy today \ud83d\ude02", "So he\u2019s allowed to masturbate he just can\u2019t look at anything besides pictures of you? And you have to be involved in any masturbation, he\u2019s never allowed to do it alone anymore because you\u2019re insecure?  You had a baby and you\u2019re engaged this is what you\u2019re worried about?  He clearly loves you if he has committed to you, he was probably trying to spare your feelings by not telling a heavily pregnant insecure woman \u201ctoo bad I\u2019m going to watch it whether you like it or not\u201d.  It sounds like you would have been unhappy regardless of his answer so he tried to pick what he thought was the nicer response to a rather silly and controlling request.  Sure he picked wrong, but there are more important things in your life right now than dictating the rules of another persons masturbation.  If he\u2019s helping you with the baby and being a good partner cut the guy some slack, it is a stressful time for you both and he couldn\u2019t predict and make promises how he was going to be feeling before actually being in the situation.", "I\u2019m so confused about why he even has to tell you if he\u2019s watching porn or not? Unless you both religiously watch it together and he\u2019s sneaking off to watch by himself I\u2019m not getting it. \n\nWell, I get he lied but I\u2019m not sure why he had to anyway. It feels a little controlling and I don\u2019t for one second thinking he freely offered to stop watching. Was it something you asked/suggested and he\u2019s agreed to save an argument?", "NTA- He lied to you. Period. It\u2019s okay to be upset when someone lies to you. He should have been honest when he realized he couldn\u2019t go without. Whether or not that in itself would have been upsetting for you is another thing. I hope you heal well and have a more peaceful weeks following this.", "YTA\n\nDon't take this the wrong way, but holy fuck you're annoying. You nag him to the point where has to lie to you so you don't start. You come off like a massive prude in your post. \n\nLet him be.

My partner knows why it's a deal breaker for me he was willing to accept it as something I require in a relationship. \nI have been experienced being with someone with a porn addiction and I'm not willing to go through it again. This is why discussing deal breaker are so important even before you enter the relationship so they can decide if it's something they are willing to do. \n\nIf you're ok with porn than that's ok too. But if it's going hurt the person you're with shouldn't they be allowed to make that choice.

To go behind your back and do something you specifically made clear you don't like is gross behavior. Especially when you JUST gave birth. Now I know there will be comments like \"p0rn isn't cheating\" and \"It's just a man thing\" but that's all bs.

Something clicked for him. I think he still watches when he is away working, but he insists he doesnt and has a locked folder of photos/vids of me he asks me to send. So he does watch porn but its me. It makes you insecure, it's not real life, it's degrading to women, there's several reasons he should not watch it and the fact he won't even quit after you just had his baby is disgusting imo. He should be catering to you and the baby. If he seriously needs to jerk off he doesn't need any assistance. Sounds like he lied cause it was easier than arguing that he doesn't agree and doesn't care at all about your feelings.", "I think most of the men (which on here it mostly is) don\u2019t understand how they would feel if their woman was watching videos, fantasizing about all the thick girthy ____ going inside them. I think your feelings are completely valid. You don\u2019t deserve to feel unwanted or not lusted over. I do believe you should have been more open about how it makes you feel, truly, but it is not an excuse. It sucks that men believe lusting over other women is excusable, but I totally understand where your coming from. Especially due to you just having a baby. Can\u2019t he look at old pictures of you? Can\u2019t he fantasize loving on you? That just makes me disgusted that it seems like he cant. I\u2019m sure your a beautiful woman, don\u2019t let this get the best of you.

So can you live with the fact and stay in a relationship when he lies to you?\n\nThen there is this issue. You had a baby and of course that mean no sex for a minimum of 6 weeks. The fact you are worried about his sexual gratification during this time period is crazy. If he is your dedicated partner, dedicated to you the relationship, respects you 100% and thinks of you and not only himself then he will wait those 6 weeks. If he cant consider you just gave birth to a tiny human, what you and your body went through and the healing process is brutal on you physically and mentally then he has a issue with sex. Sex addiction is real and it sounds as if he may be dealing with this.\n\nTo add you are 2 weeks postpartum and you emotions are all over the place right now. Your insecurities are in overdrive as well. So you saying \"my thighs are too fat and my stomach sticks out\" before the pregnancy and birth journey is nothing compared to how you feel now. I had 3 kids and was insecure prior to having kids. My thought was my husband will never want me again. You feel like the most u attractive person on earth. My youngest daughter has 4 kids and suffered from severe postpartum depression and sicosis(how ever its spelled) after every birth. Her insecurities went through the roof also. Its a natural thing you are going through. Please be aware of your feelings emotions and thoughts right now. You can slip into severe postpartum and sicosis very quickly. Its dangerous for you and your baby. Watching my daughter go through this and become suicidal scared the shit out of me.\n\nYou should be focusing on your baby and healing right now. Thinking about his sexual satisfaction at this point is unnecessary and is just making it worse for you mentally. \n\nYou both need to do some deep thinking about continuing your relationship. This problem is just the tip of whats going on deeper between you two. Ive been married 28 years and have gone through issues like this. This is way deeper than just p0rn and sex. For now you need to focus on you healing from pregnancy and birth. Focus on your baby getting bigger and stronger. You focusing so much about something like this right now iant good for the baby or you. I hate to say this but you continuing to nag about this issue right now is getting you no where. After you heal and your emotions get more stable I reccomend some couples therapy as well as individual counseling. Im not calling you nuts but you need to work on you. You cant be there for your baby if you are not fully there yourself. \n\nIn the end you both are the assholes in this situation.", "You should control him more.  Every guy watches, get over it.

Aside from the porn itself, insert anything else into the situation and you have a reason to be upset about this. I also don\u2019t like that you seemed resigned to the idea he\u2019d be watching porn due to your recovery after pregnancy. You went through pregnancy and childbirth and have to physically recover here and meanwhile he hasn\u2019t gone through any of that yet can\u2019t watch porn on your behalf? Seems like a trivial ask in comparison to me.\n\nI hope he is otherwise very supportive and helping anywhere he can while you recover and adjust with the baby at home. You must be so exhausted and definitely need your man helping however he can.", "NAH. You asked a simple thing of your partner, he agreed, then did it anyway. It's as simple as that", "For me ESH. 6 weeks after a baby is so unbelievably stressful for EVERYONE involved. Your fianc\u00e9 should never lie to you, that\u2019s a given. But at the the same time, perhaps there are some things that should go unspoken. Some men feel shame for watching porn, especially if their partner knows. He probably doesn\u2019t want to lie and feel like he\u2019s hiding it, but you making him promise to stop is just setting you both up for failure, 6 WEEKS AFTER YOU HAD A BABY. If he doesn\u2019t have a noticeable problem, like a very obvious porn addiction, then for the sake of your relationship, let that shit go. You will be both be much happier. He won\u2019t have to \u201clie\u201d to hide his shame for doing something that to him, probably isn\u2019t a big deal, and you won\u2019t have to stress and be miserable feeling guilty that your partner is not satisfied after you just had a baby 6 WEEKS AGO! (I keep emphasizing the time because it\u2019s so recent) As a 31M who is a father to two boys, 13 and 7, I will say that he definitely needs to get a better perspective on what you are going through right now. Better communication is definitely needed here on both sides. So to summarize my judgment and why I say ESH, he sucks for lying and causing mistrust in your relationship but you also suck for putting an unreasonable expectation on him. You both should communicate on how you\u2019re feeling and try to find a solution that makes you both happy. Hope everything works out and enjoy your new bundle of joy \ud83d\ude01\n\nSide note, post nut clarity is a real thing and i guarantee that when he\u2019s done handling business, he\u2019s completely turned off by the porn.", "Porn is cheating.

The question is: Am I wrong for feeling bad, because he lied to me multiple times instead of acting like an adult and TALKING about it? As she stated, she never asked him to stop. She just told him that she was uncomftorable if it. HE then had the genius idea of saying that he'll stop, without actually doing it. Him stopping with masturbating wasn't the only solution. He can for example masturbate to her nood pictures instead.\n\nI would be so worried about the future with the kid. He clearly doesn't see lying as a big thing, even after she has stated that she doesn't like it. What else will he lie about?", "There is no such thing as a survivor of porn industry lol\n\nIt's like saying that an ex bank employee is a survivor of the financial industry because they were abused by their boss.", "he doesnt and i dont either:) we both find it dumb and know what porn addiction leads to and how women are treated in the industry.", "Still unsure \ud83e\udee4 as to your intentions but moving past it.", "Yeah, but from what little information we have it seems like she really had a problem with it from the beginning and was being kind of passive aggressive about it, like \u201cwell I *know* you\u2019re going to watch it *anyway* so I  guess I\u2019ll just have to deal with it.\u201d He probably felt guilty and lied about it just to try and alleviate some of her feelings during what was naturally such a stressful time for her. I\u2019m not saying he was in the right either, but I can understand why he did it. I mean if she knew he was going to do it and understood/didn\u2019t care, why bring it up to begin with?", "I'd also lie if there was already issues/arguments in past bout porn lol", "This is why we have the gran section", "Yeah and we just watch it to check out the uh furniture and the uhhh set pieces. Yeah. Just making sure everything\u2019s up to code. Don\u2019t come in though, I\u2019m going to be busy for like 15-75 minutes.", "yeah thats why theres categories like petite, slim, ebony, tall, asian etc etc.. :D sure\nthing\n\nyes people might be watching porn for the sex act but dont act like they dont also watch it for just one person out of the two LOL", "right? majority of the downvoters r definitely addicts and excuse the porn industry as a whole ( when its inherently bad and imo porn shouldnt even exist without strict rules around it )", "She hasn't once mentioned that he's not supporting her or carrying his weight. \n\nHe understands that while she won't try and stop him, she doesn't love the idea of him using porn. He obviously just tried to save her feelings. Perhaps the fact that she just went through a whole pregnancy is exactly why he tried to tell a little white lie instead of being honest and upsetting her.", "And if he was truthful would you back off ?", "Not saying it's right or wrong, but this is an example of a woman nagging and a man saying whatever needs to be said to appease her.\n\n...Akin to **\"Honey does this dress make me look fat\"**  \ud83e\udd7a... Tell her what she wants to hear, and keep it movin!", "Check his browser history.  He probably does it more than you think \ud83e\udd14.   I agree it's a horrible industry.", "Or you would sit down and talk about the fact that she is clearly bothered by it and how to resolve it. I think lying is not justified in any case here.", "HAHAHA", "Dude, you keep saying \"you\" as if I'm the person who posted this. I'm not OP. \n\nIf he was truthful it'll progess the situation so they could talk about things such as why, can I help, it makes me feel this way and come to a compramise or conclusion. Then it wouldn't have to be spoken a out again. So yeah, she would back off if he actually bothred to talk about the issue and not just lie. That's how communication works \n\nDude, if you don't know this I don't think you've got very healthy communication model,  if your partner values communication highly, I think they might be internalising unhappiness or might express this as an issue to you. You say this as if all communication is nagging.", ">saying whatever needs to be said to appease her.\n\nClearly, this isn't appeasing hear. Just have a conversation for gods sake. She has stated multiple times in the post and in the comments that the biggest issue is that he is lying to her.", "The reality is had he said \"No honey I'm going to watch porn and jerk off till the cows come home\", the shit would have hit the fan anyway. There is no right answer here..."]}
