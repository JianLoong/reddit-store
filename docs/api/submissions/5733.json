We met my first year of college through my best friend/his cousin Priya. Last 8 years have been magical & couldn\u2019t have asked for a better partner to grow with. Within those years, we both graduated as engineers, landed amazing jobs & grew within our companies fairly quickly allowing both of us to be very well off financially. We bought our dream home, got engaged, moved in together, traveled the world , and had our now 2 year old daughter. During these eight years he has met everyone in my family and they adore him. For some reason I didn\u2019t get to meet his. Whenever I asked when he\u2019d introduce me he told me what seemed like valid excuses. Big one being his parents mostly staying back home. He loved me and treated me amazingly so I didn\u2019t give him a hard time about it, his cousin also confirmed everything he said. \n\nRaehan has been wanting to go to Pakistan to help his family for a while. He finally decided 2022 was the year. Told me he was going for 2 months but informed me (while away) that he might have to stay for 6. During his time away, Priya came to stay with me for a bit, one day while on FT with her mom (I was sitting next to her) her mom said she was invited to a wedding back home and asked Priya if she wanted to come along, long story short, we found out it was Raehan\u2019s wedding which obviously shattered me. Couldn\u2019t believe it tbh, Priya and I decided to show up without him knowing. After running it with my family, went to Pakistan, and arrived at his wedding looking FINE AF. I thought he was being forced until I saw how overjoyed he was. When he saw us, he looked like he just saw a ghost, I also had our daughter who ran and hugged him. He looked shattered while holding her. Priya privately informed his wife with proof and I still don\u2019t know how that went down. I danced the night away with our kid, enjoyed the food, music & drinks and he was literally frozen. We flew back home the next day and he has been blowing my phone up since. Every one thinks I should\u2019ve announced everything at his wedding but i\u2019m good, just the fact that I enjoyed his wedding more than he did was enough. I decided to take a \u201cgetaway\u201d trip outside the country with my daughter and honestly don\u2019t want to come back to our cold state. I love it here & might consider moving here with her. I found out he cut his trip short, and has been completely shattered he might never see us again, He clearly choose his parents wishes/ new wife over me and my daughter so he shouldn\u2019t have access to us & for that his friends say AITA. So AITA for crashing his wedding and not talking to him & WIBTA if he loses access to our kid at least for now?", "created_utc": 1672095879, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zvzo2l/aita_for_crashing_my_fianc\u00e9s_wedding_abroad/", "score": 82, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Like it would be one thing if he broke up with you but what did he think was going to happen? He would just have 2 wives/families that didn't know about eachother? That would have eventually led to him being kicked out of at least one family so I don't think he gets to act all surprised about it now.

You don't have the legal right to keep him from his child. I'm sure this whole thing has been very painful. Get an attorney for child support. You need to keep quiet! about details of everything!

Forget about them.", "you arent the asshole at all, man what a dick move on his part, i\u2019m sorry you went through this. it doesnt seem like you\u2019ve discussed custody with him though, and you should definitely make custody arrangements with him, because he might be an asshole but if he chooses to be a good father then he should be allowed to.", "NTA. Sorry, but he deserves everything coming his way. He chose to lie to you and your daughter. File for full custody and child support.", "NTA. So you had to go abroad cause he went back home to get married. My questions are\u2026Was he ever gonna come back? Was he just gonna act like you and his daughter never existed? If he was gonna be away for up to 6 months from what he told you he had no problem not being with his daughter to begin with then.", "NTA. But I would be more concerned about what he and his family would do with your daughter if they were to get her into their custody. As a woman, her rights as your\u2019s may be far more limited were they to take her away from you into another country. As an unmarried woman, in their eyes and possibly in the eyes of the government of their country, you would possibly be viewed as unfit to keep your daughter. \n\nPlease be careful not to leave your daughter alone with him or his family. You may not think he\u2019s capable of doing anything towards your daughter but you didn\u2019t know he was capable of abandoning you to marry someone of his family\u2019s choosing. \n\nYou obviously don\u2019t know him as well as you thought, through no fault of your own. He was literally leading a double life. So please don\u2019t trust him with your daughter.", "NTA I had a friend who went through something similar like you. She dated a guy from that subcontinent, got engaged, and was full on planning the wedding and everything, bought the dress, started putting deposits, etc. He was over there \"trying to convince\" his parents and in the end, caved. He owes her thousands of dollars for multiple plane tickets she bought for him, plus wedding expenses, and he just ghosted her. Even insulted her and had hid behind his family and had them insult her too. She was devastated for a long time. He chose his family over her, like your (hopefully) ex. You don't owe anyone anything, OP. Stay where you are, don't tell him for a while. Better yet, move on, get married, and then you can see him, with your new family. You're still young and very successful, I'm sure you're a catch. I know there's someone out there who will cherish you and love you and your daughter. You've been stuck with this AH since you were 18. But you're still in your prime. You can do it! Maybe you can start with therapy to unpack this, and then start dating again. Hopefully you can sell that place and have your family get your stuff to put in a storage unit for you to collect later. Good luck! You're a badass!", "YTA. \n\nRegardless of your situation you were not invited and I dont think its appropriate to crash anyone's wedding. \n\nI would be careful taking the kid away from him because that sounds illegal and might lose you custody in the long run. \n\nIm not sure how the marriage system works across nations. Just because you are his fiance in one country does not necessarily mean you are so in another. There also are religions such as muslim that advocates for multiple wives.", "Yes OP please give us a update once you have had time to heal. Right now you will probably be in shock and deep down its going to be a very emotional time. What was he planning on doing with your daughter, you and his job with the new wife? How long has he been seeing his wife etc.", "Well he's married to someone else now so I'd say so. I don't know what he thought was going to happen but I love that he seems so surprised and heartbroken by this.", "yeah it reads like OP wanted to test the plot of something", "Yeah this gave me Marian Keyes vibes", ">it is not your place to project your own response to the massive betrayal onto your child\n\nThe guy went to another country under the guise of 'helping family' and secretly married someone else. I would be terrified of him taking their daughter and refusing to return.

Love the words of wisdoms. Yes, I\u2019m hurt but healing. My daughter is priority & I don\u2019t want her to lose her relationship with her dad but he deserves to sweat a little. I don\u2019t want to see him just yet. We\u2019re enjoying ourselves on a trip and will stay here until I\u2019m emotionally ready to go back to the states. Also, he kept her a secret her whole life, a part of me wants to make sure she\u2019s no longer a secret if he wants her in his life.", "I don\u2019t plan on denying him access to our child, she deserve to have her father in her life, but he kept her a secret and his family besides his cousin and her family don\u2019t know about our little girl. If he wants her in his life, he needs to introduce her & make her priority.", "I mean, if she'd ever write a song about a guy who wasn't white.", "Isn\u2019t morally wrong to have a child with someone, propose to them, then lie and tell them you have to visit family when you\u2019re actually getting married to someone else who DOESNT know about the woman and child he left in America???????? I feel it\u2019s morally wrong to have two separate families and hide your child from the family they could have. I\u2019m with OP. He needs to sweat. You don\u2019t know if he would just take the kid with him to his new wife and never let OP see her again.", "Yes & no. He\u2019s been a wonderful father, took care of her, spent a lot of time with her & she adores him. However, he kept her a secret all her life. He comes from a large family and hasn\u2019t introduced her to anyone. If he wants to have a relationship with her, I think he needs to introduce her to the people who mean the world to him. He literally left us due to fear of rejection from his family. Imagine what happens when they reject her? He\u2019ll obviously just cut her off, he already pretends like she doesn\u2019t exist. I just need him to prove that he won\u2019t do that to her again.", "I mean yeah, I feel like letting your daughter be your \"dirty secret\" and then abandoning your family to secretly marry someone else while tricking your child and partner into thinking you're just on a trip and are coming back counts as being a bad father.", "I can't speak from experience but I really think not having a father would be better then growing up as your father's shameful secret, any child deserves better than this.", "I had to remove a chunk explaining all this due to word count.  He had valid excuses for not introducing us.  He claimed his parents retired back him and spend most their time in Pakistan. He did introduce me to 2/4 of his siblings.  He also told me that his parents and Desi parents in general give their children a hard time and when they want to be in interracial/ religious relationships (which we were) and that he was trying to warm them up to the idea.  He was afraid of being disowned and I didn\u2019t want to push him and was waiting for him to be comfortable. I refused to marry him until I met them though, I didn\u2019t want in-laws who hated me.  As for involving my daughter, I brought her with me to introduce her to her grandparents but decided it wasn\u2019t worth it.  I plan on sharing custody.. just need to stay away for a bit.", "Thats BS. Full stop. He hid his child from his family. Why should he get to have unlimited access to a child he wouldn\u2019t even claim to the people who mean most to him?", "Heartbroken that he got caught. Pathetic.", "I would absolutely watch this romcom. Probably more of a romdram but still.", "> If it was my kid I wouldn't allow him unsupervised access with her until theres a court order not allowing the kid out of the country with both parents permission.\n\nA good & logical idea.", "I most definitely would NOT leave the child alone with the father especially in Pakistan.\n\nThis is not a country that is fair to single mothers and I would bet that the courts would favor the father if he had physical possession.", "Nta. Do you! The best revenge is being successful and moving on. Find someone else, make a family and ur new hubby will become ur daughter's father. That's the best revenge. Don't even bother letting his fam know ur daughter. What a complete buffoon ur hubby is. Can't man up and stand up to his parents at the cost of his child and wife. Nta", "Your daughter isn\u2019t a dirty fucken secret, she isnt his shame. Fuck this guy (not literally lol). You do what\u2019s best. This guy is going to bounce anyway and go back to his home country to be with his wife and have kids. I don\u2019t think your daughter will have a relationship with him unfortunately. His family will not allow his \u201cfilthy mistake\u201d to be part of his life\u2026 disgusting if you ask me.", "You need a custody and child support agreement that includes taking your child out of the country only with your permission.", "That is beyond reasonable. He doesn't deserve to be in there life if he's going to treat her like his dirty secret.", "You should contact a lawyer specializing in international custody cases immediately. I don't think it would be a good idea to have your kid go to Pakistan with her dad anytime soon, possibly ever.", "Which is why he is also TA. Relax. There's also nothing to indicate he would \"take the kid\". If anything, OP is the one doing that right now.\n\nIf you think she's right then fine, i don't really care. If you would keep a daughter from her father to make him \"sweat\" then you can argue that on your own time. The justice system does not look kindly upon it, which has been proven time and time again.", "Totally agree. Now he\u2019s married and will probably have children with his new wife\u2026 unfortunately your daughter will be an afterthought. Lawyer up.", "Take him to court. Get an agreement in order to protect yourself. I don't know what country you live in but he could try pressing kidnapping charges against you.", "Absolutely, what I meant was : she used something that is gonna hurt her daughter to be petty to her husband. She could have been petty all on her own instead of bringing the baby into this ? I remember shit that happened to me when i was two, i vividly remember some of them. I hope her daughter wont.", "Full stop??? \n\nPlease, the courts don't and won't care why they split unless he was physically abusive to the baby.", "Yeah but there's not enough indicating that he wouldn't either. It wouldn't make sense given he wants to keep his daughter a secret from everyone (we can have a whole discussion about her being his dirty secret if we want to talk about what's best for the kid), but marrying someone else when you apparently want to be with your fiance/mother of your child/partner of 8 years also doesn't make sense. All we know for sure is this guy 100% absolutely cannot be trusted and I would be afraid to take such a gamble with my child knowing he could disappear to another country with her anytime.", "They will care. Especially if he has legal residency in another country. If the kid wasn\u2019t born there and the mother resides in the country the kid was born then the courts will give the mother custody, and the father visitation. Especially if he\u2019s married in the other country. And before you pull the \u201cdual citizenship\u201d card, yes he could do that but he\u2019d have to get the moms and the courts approval. Which he clearly won\u2019t get.", "What exactly did you think was BS and was, therefore,the end of the discussion?"]}
