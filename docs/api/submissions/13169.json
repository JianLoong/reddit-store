Brother is living with the consequences of his own actions. You are not the cause of this - brother caused this by being a homophobic jerk. He had a choice - if this really disturbed him, he simply could of left the room as opposed to throwing a tantrum. Also, it is the parent's house - they are the ones who make the rules, not Brother.\n\nThe tactic of getting friends or family to gang up on someone like Brother is doing is typical of people who are naturally abusive or just plain bullies. It's the sign of a coward. And I'm sure there is an easy way for him to no longer be homeless: apologize and agree not to throw homophobic tantrums while living with his parents.", "NTA.
