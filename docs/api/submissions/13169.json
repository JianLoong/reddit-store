I don't think it's shameful to live with your parents as an adult. But to be 26, constantly cycling through jobs, and living with your parents? He needs to grow up.

Or did he lose her bc of this?", "NTA \n\nSuper weird of him being upset with you and your boyfriend showing any kind of affection. Pay attention to what he said in his fit.

They were not only tolerating your boyfriend\u2019s brother\u2019s lack of steady employment and most importantly they support whatever kind of relationship both of their sons have-one heterosexual and one homosexual. They sincerely wanted you and your boyfriend, their son, to have a loving relationship. They absolutely don\u2019t want or need to control your relationship. They just wanted you to feel accepted by them and that made them very happy. What doesn\u2019t make them happy was 1. Boyfriend\u2019s brother treating their home like he owned it and 2. Extended family sticking their nose where it doesn\u2019t belong. Don\u2019t feel guilty about having a loving relationship. Your boyfriend\u2019s brother got himself kicked out of his parents house, not you. You didn\u2019t go off about his relationship. You didn\u2019t treat their home as if you owned it.

Then it wasn\u2019t his parents who minded the pda, it was his brother who thought it was fine to grope his girlfriend in front of everyone which is  so disrespectful.", "NTA. Also LOL. He needs to learn a lesson. If you cant respect people who are different than you, you will end up homeless. You literally cant function in society. Sure the super rich get away with it but the majority do not.", "Nta.\nBut I want you to consider that maybe the brother is probably spreading stories at whichever house he is crashing at. If somebody says anything or asks, perhaps you need to say that what happened is between him and the parents and that if they are that curious maybe they should ask the parents.

If a woman is too interested in a man, she's not as much of a threat to him physically, whereas if a man is interested that's more of an even fight, should it come to a physical altercation. And I believe some men feel threatened by this, even if it's subconsciously.  \n\n\nMeanwhile, women navigate a world where half the populace is a potential threat because of the strength difference and they cope. Men who do fear other men like that should human up.", "So he\u2019s actually 14?", "You probably did his parents a huge favor.", "Word", "His lack of plans to save up and move out is potentially connected to his display of entitlement to his parents\u2019 home.", "But when he lives on the charity of other people, he has to understand that he can\u2019t act like an asshole and continue to have a place to live. This is a FAFO moment for him and well deserved by the sound of it.", "Or he is one of those \u2018chicks with chicks\u2019 is ok bc it\u2019s \u2018hot\u2019 type of people.", "I'm glad you posted this, I couldn't understand before.

In middle school I actually went through a brief incel/homophobic phase because of 9gag & certain subreddits like Tumblr in action.\n\nI was struggling with accepting my bisexuality (and just figuring out that I was), and developed some internal homophobia.\n\nI kept it *all* private & online. In person I never showed it. When I came out to my close friends, some were quite surprised.\n\nOne friend I've had since elementary school shocked *me*, by saying she related, and also went through an internal homophobic stage in middle school.\n\nAs I became more social irl/spent less time online, I started to mature & move away from it.

He experienced consequences for being a massive bigot because his parents are absolutely delightful people. :) Listen to them telling you that they're happy that you feel comfortable to be the loving couple you are, not the jerks who support the homophobe.
