BF\u2019s brother is a homophobic asshole who violated his parent\u2019s standards while living in their home. Bonus points for BF\u2019s parents for knowing how to support their gay son.", "NTA. At all. And give those parents a high five from me :)", "NTA, but dude, confusing title. I thought you were making your bf homeless. I'm glad his parents are good people. I guess they're pretty disappointed with their other son. Sadly we don't get to pass on all our values.", "NTA You haven't done anything, you have just exisisted and someone else has reacted.\n\nThis guy could have not given a fuck, gone to another room or been happy for you but now because they couldn't be an adult about shit they have been asked by adults to leave the premises those adults own after what has been many chances given by those same adults .", "NTA.\n\nHE got himself evicted. Actions have consequences.  He decided to have a homophobic meltdown and his parents said not in our house.", "NTA.  He caused himself to be homeless.  Play stupid games and win stupid prizes", "NTA. Brother is living with the consequences of his own actions. You are not the cause of this - brother caused this by being a homophobic jerk. He had a choice - if this really disturbed him, he simply could of left the room as opposed to throwing a tantrum. Also, it is the parent's house - they are the ones who make the rules, not Brother.\n\nThe tactic of getting friends or family to gang up on someone like Brother is doing is typical of people who are naturally abusive or just plain bullies. It's the sign of a coward. And I'm sure there is an easy way for him to no longer be homeless: apologize and agree not to throw homophobic tantrums while living with his parents.", "NTA. I also love the parents.", "So NTA. He is out of line. It is. It his house. He is not in a place to tell you how to behave in it, only the parents are. Feel no guilt, live your lives and enjoy the relationship you have with your boyfriends parents. Show them support through this situation.", "Well the AH in this story is pretty obvious and wearing a cape of homophobia and a staff of rage. NTA", "NTA, brother and his homophobic outburst made himself homeless.  Don't like it?  Don't look. Odd how it was totally okay he was doing the same thing and worse with his girlfriend but I guess because in his mind it's \"normal\" that's okay. \n\nLove is love is love.  Even it it doesn't like what someone considers \"normal\" who gives a fuck? Having someone love you is amazing in itself. Whether it's boy and girl, boy and boy, girl and girl, nonbinary and trans, WHO CARES?  The world would be SO MUCH BETTER if people minded their own fuckin business.", "NTA - There are opportunities for people to demonstrate the values they say they have.

His homophobia did that.", "Nta, bro is homophobic and made himself homeless, that\u2019s on him. Just wish his gf was there that day to leave him too", "NTA\n\nYour boyfriends brother is a homophobic prick who needs to get over himself, and cudos to the parents for putting their foot down and supporting you!", "NTA  this man is a homophobic jerk & his parents are right in not tolerating that behavior.   This is a grown man we're talking about.  It's time he started living on his own.  Maybe some real life experience will make him a better human.  Go NC with anyone supporting his awful behavior.", ">Now me and bf are playing block wackamole with his extended family calling us horrible shit for \"making\" his brother homeless (hes couch surfing). \n\nI would think that the only answer to the flying monkeys is telling them how appalled you are that they aren\u2019t supporting their family and are trying to cause pain to your BF\u2019s parents. They should be ashamed of themselves. Decent people would be horrified to flaunt their bigotry in front of others. If they feel BF\u2019s brother\u2019s behavior is acceptable then they are welcome to house and pay for his choices themselves.", "NTA. He can apologize and go back to his parents at any moment.

Brother is and an a-hole though and from what it looks like, a bigot. Parents are correct in their actions as well. Seems like brother got consequences for his own actions.", "NTA - What awesome parents and how sad they've created such an awful son. Honestly they've probably been hoping he would pull something unforgivable like this to finally kick him out. I'm sure extended family will be singing a different time after he's been in their couch for a couple weeks", "NTA. Your bfs parents sound amazing, and if your bf is half as polite and understanding as them, you gotta wife him up. Also, it's not your fault. It was your best parents' decision to kick him out.", "This was really confusing until I realized you were a gay couple. At first I thought the brother was just anit-PDA in general (PDA of any kind is so uncomfortable for me so ibwas feeling empathetic) but it sounds like hes only anti-pda specifically because you are gay so NTA", "NTA, I love it when homophobes suffer.", "ESH. \nEverything was fine until you decided to engage in more PDA out of spite.
