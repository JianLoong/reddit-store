I did go and see him the day after the surgery which my GF told me I should go. He was scheduled to be released on Friday and I promised to help get him home with my mom so I had told my GF that we should schedule a time for Saturday so we can go see a house and this is both of our first house. Our lease in our apartment expires in 9 months.\n\nFriday comes and I get word that they are changing the release day to Saturday. I tell her that they changed it to Saturday and asked if we should still try for Saturday. She got upset and started telling me that my sister's should help, even though they will be the ones helping during the recovery (I live about an hour away from my parents while my sister's are about 10 minutes). I said I promised I would help and I think that I could still make it if it's in the morning but she might have to go by herself (rescheduling was not an option for her).\n\nThe day comes and as I'm about to leave, she says to wait and she will come with to the hospital. I thought that was great she could help but the entire way there I got chewed out because it was his fault for eating bad and being overweight or that my sister's needed to help; this went on for about an hour.\n\nWe finally got close to the hospital and I said you can drop me off and then leave if you want (she was just going to wait outside, I probably shouldn't have said anything). She said okay that's fine. Then she saw a subway (she didn't eat lunch) and decided that she wanted to get a sandwich (we were told the release time and we were there about 15 minutes before that time. I got out and ended up walking close to a block to the hospital while she got her food. \n\nShe then proceeded to leave saying I made a choice and sees where my priorities lie and left me at the hospital without a car to get myself home. So now I need to ask my sister's to take me back to our apartment.\n\nTLDR: AITA for choosing to help my dad over going to see a house?", "created_utc": 1697309003, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/177w3rd/aita_for_helping_my_dad_out_of_the_hospital_and/", "score": 91, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
