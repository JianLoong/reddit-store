When I enter a mosque or temple I take off my shoes. You are complaining about being asked to wear a formal dress (which is gorgeous by the way) because it is not your style.  It's not as if what you are being asked to do is immodest in Indian culture. \n\nYTA.", "YTA. \n\n1) are you white or otherwise differently cultured from the bride? because the outfit you want to wear is v immodest compared to what she wants the bridesmaids to wear/what she herself is wearing. just because it\u2019s vaguely desi doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s her actual culture \ud83e\udd72\n\n2) also, A-lines are probably more readily flattering on most body types than a crop top sari.\n\n3) also also, it doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s \u2018not your religion\u2019 \u2014 it\u2019s HER wedding and you\u2019re invited to participate in an event from HER culture, and if the bride wants her bridesmaids to match/dress modestly then they should without question\u2026.because that\u2019s a normal request from a bride.\n\nhope it\u2019s worth throwing your friendship away i guess??", "YTA. Your job is to support the bride, and that includes wearing the outfit she chooses (within reason, which this is).

More importantly, that dress is damn gorgeous.", "You're a bridesmaid, and she's buying the dresses? Wear the damn dress and stop complaining.\n\nYou have 100% the right to refuse being a bridesmaid though.

It\u2019s the bride\u2019s prerogative to decide what dresses she wants in the wedding. You\u2019re a bad friend for trying to bully her into doing things your way. She is not a bridezilla at all.", "YTA. It's not bridezilla of her to ask to stick to the same dress style, it's actually pretty normal and expected. And yes, there is a notable difference between the outfits in terms of modesty. \n\nYou, of course, have a right to back out of being a bridesmaid over the dress. But do you really  want to throw out a friendship over an outfit you'll wear for several hours?", "YTA.\n\nThe only difference between what you want and what she wants is the exposed flesh. The silhouette is basically the same.\n\nYou can go into the intricacies of modest or not modest all you want, and I suspect I'd fall on your side of it ... but it's not your wedding, and she's not asking that much of you (clothing wise).", "Why on earth is it ok for you to wear a different dress and uncovered abs at someone else\u2019s wedding?", "YTA - its the bride's prerogative to select the dresses that SHE wants for HER wedding.  You don't compromise on this.

First of all, it's become pretty standard custom that the bride gets to choose the bridesmaids' dresses, and unless she demands that they wear something which literally doesn't come in their size, or has a similarly extreme problem, the bridesmaids are expected to shut up and go with it. \n\nI don't necessarily understand the desire, myself. I refused to tell my friends what to wear when it came to my own weddings, and they came in a lovely mismatched collection of whatever they already owned that they felt like wearing that day.\n\nBut this isn't about me, and it isn't about you. It's about the bride at this particular wedding, and she is well within normally acknowledged rights to choose what her bridesmaids wear. \n\nSecond of all, the outfit you want to wear really isn't as modest as the one she chose, and she's within reason to be concerned about that if this is a religious wedding (or even if she, or one of her family members or in-laws whom she wants to appease, is simply a religious person). It doesn't matter that you're not a member of that particular religion -- the people who would be looking at you are, and she has every right to say, \"It will make them, or me, uncomfortable if they have to see *me* present a woman who is immodestly dressed by their standards at *my* wedding. You're welcome to wear whatever you like anyplace else, and I won't judge, but at my own wedding I don't want there to be a religious conflict.\" \n\nEither accept her judgment about what you wear at her wedding with good grace, or else bow out of being a bridesmaid.", "I thought most brides chose the dresses for their bridesmaids. YTA", "I was all ready to say N T A until I saw your pictures. You want to wear a crop top in place of her choice with full coverage and sleeves? \n\nThat is way too drastic a difference. Not to mention how weird it will look to have all the wedding party in those styles and you there with your belly out. \n\nYTA for all that. But if you don't want to wear her dress, then don't be a bridesmaid. But don't be surprised if you're not friends anymore after.", "YTA man Op would it kill you to wear that dress one time on someones wedding holy", "YTA. Her wedding, her choice. The dress she has chosen is beautiful & will complement her dress well. They are miles apart in terms of modesty. Honestly as part of a bridal party you are there to support the bride not to try & look hot anyway. I\u2019ve seen bridesmaids wear worse. If you don\u2019t want to wear the dress then don\u2019t be a bridesmaid.", "YTA, so you want to wear a crop top to her wedding. You\u2019re more than unreasonable. Even without seeing the pictures you were TA, the pictures just proved that you\u2019re an even bigger AH.", "YTA. The dresses are completely different. You obviously won't fit in with your crop top so its better that you back out.", "Haha YTA. Bridesmaidzilla", "YTA. This is a day about her. Not you. Even if you feel like the dress doesn\u2019t compliment you, it\u2019s what she wants and she is the one getting married. I\u2019m a lesbian on the not so fem side and wore a dress for my friend since she wanted all of the bridesmaids to have the same dress. I sucked it up. Because it wasn\u2019t about me. Some brides choose a theme for dresses and others want their bridesmaids to wear the same dress and if that\u2019s what she wants and you want to be her bridesmaid then you should wear it.", "YTA. It\u2019s her special day. She could just cut you out of the wedding. I would.", "YTA. It\u2019s not Bridezilla to want to same dress for everyone. The one you chose is vastly different. Modesty is subjective and if she wants her bridesmaids completely covered, that\u2019s her choice. The one you chose shows a lot of skin  it\u2019s her choice not to allow it. You are making it all about you. It\u2019s not your day.", "YTA. It\u2019s HER wedding. I think the dress she chose for you is absolutely gorgeous!!!!!", "YTA. Her day, her choice. It's not about you at all. Do her a favor and back out now since you really don't understand what your role is as a bridesmaid.", "YTA. The bride gets to pick the outfit. That\u2019s not Bridezilla at all, it\u2019s literally just the norm. Your job as a bridesmaid is to show up in the outfit you were told to wear.", "YTA. There is a clear difference in modesty between the linked dress that D chose, versus the outfit you want to wear. It doesn't matter if you aren't a part of the religion \u2014 D is, and it's up to D what theme or outfit cohesion she wants with her bridal party, since it's her wedding.", "YTA \n\nBasically no bridesmaid in the history of weddings has liked the bridesmaid dress. You suck it up and wear it because *this isn\u2019t about you*. Wearing something different draws attention to yourself, and for what? Because you\u2019re so focused on yourself you haven\u2019t realized that no one else will be? \n\nShe\u2019s making the very standard demands of her bridesmaids that the vast majority of brides make: that you wear the coordinated look with the rest of the wedding party. You are the one causing drama.

She\u2019s not being a bridezilla\u2026 unless the bride says you can choose your own dress, you wear what they picked out. If you don\u2019t wanna do that, don\u2019t be a bridesmaid. You\u2019re there to support the bride on her day.\n\n\nAre bridesmaidzillas a thing?", "YTA it is her wedding and she has the final say. The day is hers to be the center of attention", "YTA, if you won't wear the dress, pull out and let someone who will take your place. Don't personally attack your friend for planning her wedding.", "YTA . Is a bridesmaidzilla a thing? If you don\u2019t want to wear the dress she picked, turn down the offer to be a bridesmaid. But as others have said, it\u2019s about her and not you, and if you care about her, you\u2019ll wear the dress she picked and be supportive.", "YTA. \nIf you don\u2019t see the difference between the two dresses on your own, my explanation won\u2019t help.", "Oh yeah, YTA. If you don't want to wear the outfit, kindly back out now.", "YTA. It doesn\u2019t matter whether you follow that religion or not. It is her wedding and should follow what she sets as guidelines. She\u2019s not acting like a bridezilla, you are just trying to make her out to be one because she\u2019s not going along with your disrespect to her and her religion. You should have respected her wishes. Good for her that she didn\u2019t oblige to your stubbornness and disrespect. It\u2019s her day not yours.", "YTA.  Yes the bridesmaidzilla.  The dress you want to wear is not modest, especially in comparison with the long sleeve bridesmaid dress the bride chose.  Regardless of modest or immodest, the choice is the bride's.  It is her day \n\nMaybe you could try not being a narcissist for at least the day of the wedding.  The day of the wedding, the bride is the main character,  not the guests, not the bridesmaids, not you. Im sure that is difficult for you to comprehend that you will be at an event and not be the focus of everyone's attention.", "YTA. With a friend like you, who needs an enemy? This is her wedding, and she gets to pick the bridesmaid dresses. There\u2019s no compromise here. \n\nAnd the outfit you want is clearly leaps and bounds more immodest than what she has chosen. Suck it up and be there for your friend. Or lose the relationship entirely.", "This is so dumb, of course YTA. \n\nBridesmaids don't (usually) choose the outfit. Either wear what the bride picked or bow out.\n\nThe only 'zilla here is you", "YTA. It\u2019s not about you. If you don\u2019t want to be a bridesmaid, just step down and attend as a guest.", "YTA.  The dress she picked is gorgeous and you want to wear basically a bra top with a skirt.  So inappropriate.\n\nYou sound very entitled.  Just drop out if you can\u2019t respect the brides wishes.", "YTA. Apologize to your friend. If you don\u2019t want to wear it, step down and just attend as a guest.", "YTA. She's not being a bridezilla. This is a perfectly normal request. Plus your choice would likely take attention away from the Bride herself. This doesn't feel like a religious butting of heads and more like you can't stand a moment out of the spotlight. Do everyone a favor and drop out.", "Wow YTA. You make it sound like she wanted you to wear a puke green potato sack. Her choice isn\u2019t that bad. A good friend wouldn\u2019t complain about this, surprised she asked you to be a bridesmaid", "You\u2019re not the main character - stop trying to make her wedding about yourself. YTA", "YTA If you don\u2019t want to wear the bridesmaid\u2019s dress she picked out, then you should bow out of being a bridesmaid. If every single bridesmaid had to be in love with their bridesmaid dress, then we would never have the gem that is the movie 27 Dresses. And then my husband wouldn\u2019t have a secret guilty pleasure movie. Where would we be then?", "YTA. It is better for her to find a friend who actually supports her and wants her day to be perfect. She\u2019s just asking you to wear a full dress instead of a crop top, and you can\u2019t do that for one evening for your so called friend?\n\nEdit: BTW her picking a dress for her bridesmaids is very standard for a bride, and doesn\u2019t make her a bridezilla. I do have a feeling I know who will be one, though\u2026", "Um, that dress absolutely is NOT similar. YTA", "YTA. Brides get to choose the bridesmaid dresses and there\u2019s nothing wrong with what she picked. You just don\u2019t like it. She could pick chartreuse satin ballgowns and she would be well within her rights. You don\u2019t have to like it, it\u2019s not for you. \n\nIf you\u2019re not ok with truly standard parts of being a bridesmaid, you should attend as a guest before you completely blow up your relationship with the bride.", "YTA", "YTA. That's a normal bridesmaid dress. What you are suggesting doesn't fit in with her wedding.", "YTA\n\nWhat you picked is much less modest. At a glance, I'm assuming a Desi wedding and her family might be Muslim.  Bare midriff is gonna be an automatic no-go. If you don't want to wear it, don't be a bridesmaid.", "YTA. You are not the main character. Why are you trying to be? I think that her choice is beautiful, by the way", "YTA. The fit will be weird on you? The dress she picked is beautiful.

I\u2019m speaking as someone who is of desi heritage. I understand that you\u2019d prefer to wear the lehenga. And you\u2019d prefer to be a part of the bridal party. But you can\u2019t have both things. I\u2019ve worn lehengas, salwars, etc. All are beautiful in their own ways. But the lehenga in the pic you provided is not what your friend is comfortable with. These will be in her wedding pics forever and she cares about her bridesmaids being covered. That isn\u2019t brizezilla behavior. So what matters more to you? Wearing the outfit you want or being a bridesmaid. Either answer is fine, but calling your friend names is rude and uncalled for.\n\nEdited to add: as an Indian American you should know how to have some cultural relativism.

Brides get to pick the dresses and colors they want for the bridesmaids. Also that dress is gorgeous. Wearing a crop top is not appropriate to her and that is all she should have to say. She absolutely isn't a bridezilla but you seem like a bad friend. Just suck it up and wear it for a few hours. I don't understand why that is too much to ask of you. Many of us have worn truly ugly bridesmaid dresses because we love our friends and it is only for a day.", "YTA. She's not a bridezilla at all. When I first heard you say it wouldn't suit you, I was sympathetic thinking that perhaps you were overweight or what not. No instead you just want to show off your midriff and you're willing to throw away a friendship over that. It's not your wedding.

She made a perfectly reason request that literally all brides make which is for her bridesmaids to wear a dress of her choosing. You just wanted to stand out and feel special which is why you insist on where a belly bearing outfit despite her obvious want for something more modest.

On her wedding day?", "YTA.", "YTA. \n\nFirst off, when you are in a wedding party you are basically an actor in a show.

And ugly as hell loafers. Square toes. You just do it because you love the person. \n\nYou clearly don\u2019t love your friend enough to be her bridesmaid.

The fact that it\u2019s a crop top in a modest wedding also makes you a bigger AH.", "YTA \n\nIf you don\u2019t want to dress like the other bridesmaids, then don\u2019t be a bridesmaid. Pretty simple.", "YTA be fuckin' for real right now. There's no way you're this dense to think the dress you picked is modest like the one she picked. Also it's not your wedding! It's your friend's wedding what she says goes on her special day, if you have a problem with that then don't be apart of it. As a bridesmaid you're there to support her & love her that's it, if you can't do that bc you don't like the dress she's asking you to wear then you're a shitty friend & should bow out of the wedding.", "YTA simply because it\u2019s D\u2019s wedding not yours.

Drop out officially, you can\u2019t handle being there for someone at this level.", "YTA. What is wrong with you that you think that those dresses are anywhere near being the same???

The chosen dress is gorgeous, your selection would look trashy next to the bride and other bridesmaids. It\u2019s inappropriate for her chosen aesthetic. You sound extremely self centered and like you\u2019re not a good friend at all.", "YTA. These two things aren't even close in modesty. Your entire midriff is exposed in the dress you've picked. As far as bridesmaid's dresses go the one she picked is actually quite cute. Either wear the dress or step aside as a bridesmaid. Definitely don't continue to badger her about wearing a dress that she considers immodest. Even if you aren't a follower of her faith, you are participating in a religious ritual so you should respect the faith as a participant in the wedding.", "I would have been thrilled to wear that dress that the bride selected.  It is absolutely gorgeous.  The bride is trying to discreetly tell you that she doesn\u2019t want your midriff on display at her wedding.  \n\nI wore many absolutely hideous bridesmaid dresses without a peep of complaint to bride or to anyone who might let my opinion slip.  It\u2019s the couple\u2019s day and celebration.  If you agree to be a bridesmaid and the bride picks out a burlap sack for her bridal party to wear, the world won\u2019t end if you put it on without complaint, smile for the wedding and reception photos and after everything is said and done, throw it out/set it on fire/etc.\n\nI tried to consign my dresses and they were such horror shows that the consignment stores declined to accept them.  I stuck them in the back of my closet and when my nieces were old enough to enjoy playing dress up, I brought them over (along with the shoes and costume jewelry) and cut the dresses down to size for my nieces (they loved that I left the back full length \u201clike a princess\u2019s train\u201d).  In their defense, they were 6 and 3 at the time.", "YTA. If she says it\u2019s not appropriate, she has her reasons. It doesn\u2019t matter whatsoever what your opinion is.

She's not asking for anything outlandish, whereas you ARE in comparison. \n\nIf you don't want to be a part of the wedding, don't be a part of it- trying to hold your own attendance hostage to get what you want has clearly backfired, with the bride telling you \"okay, sure\" on you backing out. \n\nWas your friendship really worth permanently altering (if not ending) for this? Because you wanted an exposed stomach at someone else's wedding, knowing they wanted more modest and covered clothing? Ooft.", "Of course YTA how did you type this out and not see that. Bride chooses the dress and bridesmaids wear that dress. I have worn unflattering dresses I would never have chosen as a bridesmaids but that is literally par for the course in being part of the wedding party. Your friend is in no way a bridezilla and the fact that she already tolerated your BS speaks volumes to her patience.", "You seem insufferable..  You might think your custom dress is modest but you actually know her.  You even said you both are different regions and knowing her must make you aware of the cultural differences.  If you are that insistent about following your own customs and won\u2019t just wear the f*cking bridesmaids dress like the rest us do then bow out.  You insisted on your way and couldn\u2019t get your way so you stomped your feet like a toddler and \u201cstomped out the playground\u201d.   That should be relief to bride and not make her sad, planning a wedding is a lot of work and very stressful.  Did I really have to explain that to you?!  She\u2019s the main character of her movie (her wedding) not you.  \n\nMy lack of knowledge could make me wrong but the picture makes me believe it\u2019s just a dress that isn\u2019t part of custom in India.  Someone let me know\u2026", "YTA....and a terrible friend", "Tell her to message me, I\u2019d rock the hell out of that dress! YTA", "YTA but my favorite wedding drama stories are where the bridesmaids are the entitled AHs so thanks for the giggle.", "Let me make this simple, straightforward, and easy for you. Drop out of being a bridesmaid. Because YTA.\n\nOh and, PLEASE don't go to the wedding especially if you're gunna show up in a sari or lehenga that's showing your belly and back. Because that's NOT modest in ALL cultures/religions.\n\nI love the Bride's choice for her bridesmaid dresses. I'm a little surprised she chose red since she's also wearing red but I guess that's why she went with an outfit that's not so decked out so everything is balanced.\n\nBesides, the one you wanna wear is so over rated at this point for bridesmaids. Don't get me wrong, it's also beautiful and I love a floral skirt but it has run its course for now.\n\nBased on your comments, you're Desi. From one Desi to another.. and I don't really say this to people but.. are you really THAT DUMB?! Jeeeez girl.", "lengas are very popular to wear at weddings and bride is gonna be in for a rude awakening when she sees all the guests wearing them", "OP must be blind.", "I had a bridesmaid like this. She stressed me out so much my ex almost booted her from the wedding, and she was his friend more than mine.   \n\n\nIf it were the bride we were talking to I'd say good riddance.", "I\u2019m thinking OP doesn\u2019t know what modest means. It doesn\u2019t just mean to cover your tits.", "A beautiful dress, at that!", "And this isn\u2019t even that bad, because this beautiful dress is far from being hideous. But I guess if we\u2019re not showing off our midriff then we can throw a fit about it.\n\nOP, listen to the person above me. Shut up and wear the dress the bride wants, or follow through with your threat and drop out so she can replace you with someone supportive.", "The only way I'd side with a bridesmaid on this was if the dress was more revealing than they were comfortable with, or didn't have proper bust support.\n\nBut at the end of the day, wear what the bride wants, or step down as a bridesmaid.", "Yup.", "I'm not white, both me and D are Indian-American but we're from different parts of India and different religious backgrounds", "Agree on it being gorgeous! I swear I have 27 bridesmaids dressing and none of them are that stunning!", "OP would still be TA even if the dress she picked was better because it\u2019s not her wedding. She doesn\u2019t get to decide, the bride does. If OP has a problem, she can drop out. But the bride isn\u2019t a bridezilla for wanting a certain outfit.", "In fairness to OP, what she wants to wear is a sari with a relatively short blouse, which is appropriate wedding attire among Indian Hindus. But... she is the TA for not wanting to flex.", "I actually didn't dislike the dresses I had to wear for being a bridesmaid in either wedding I've been in officially. The first it was all about the prom style dresses and I wore the top portion a bit after but during a purge it was the first thing to go (we paid for the dress and she handled organizing alterations); the second wedding the bride gave us a color and said to get whatever dress as long as it was that color, but I still double checked before I ordered to make sure it was okay with her - I still have that dress because it was a lot more casual and it has POCKETS.", "Indeed, when my sister got married she wanted her bridesmaids to wear purple, long dresses. In summer. A season where no purple formal dresses are to be found anywhere. Not only that, but its a color that never looks good on me.\n\nStill went out of my way to try to find one and wore it. Thank goodness for goodwill because I couldnt find one for shiet lol.", "They are here!", "But it\u2019s mOdeSt too\ud83d\ude44", "The 'bra top with a skirt' is a traditional Indian outfit called a lehenga.

I want it for myself.", "Also the dresses she chose go with her actual wedding dress. You just picked something you want to wear \u2026 if you don\u2019t like the bridesmaids dresses don\u2019t be a bridesmaid: that simple.", "so yes, you\u2019re differently cultured from the bride. different parts of India and different religious backgrounds. You said that you think your option is perfectly modest and culturally appropriate, well maybe in your culture from your are with your religion but she explained that from her perspective, from the point of view of her culture and religion, that outfit is inappropriate. Also the aesthetic of your pic and hers don\u2019t match at all, her pick is fancy and ornate and clearly belongs at an important expensive event. Your pick is cute but it\u2019s far too casual, doesn\u2019t match and looks more like it belongs at a relaxed beach wedding then a formal, religious ceremony.

Imagine the cost of paying for a venue that large.", "But your friend doesn\u2019t want you to wear it to *her* wedding.  Look, part of being a bridesmaid is wearing what the bride requests, within reason, & the dress she picked seems very reasonable. YTA.", "That's fine. It is still less modest and not what the bride wants you to wear.", "But clearly for your friend, modest means covering the midriff, arms, etc. unlike this outfit. She is allowed to want that for her wedding. She decides what bridesmaids wear", "Maybe as a guest. if you want to go as a guest, that\u2019s an option you can suggest.", "Yes In SOME Indian cultures. In Pakistani culture or more traditional Indian culture, you ABSOLUTELY would be wayyyyy too revealing. Gosh, just drop out of the wedding. YTA", "No. The skirt is a lengha. The top is a choli.

But they aren't Muslim. And I have a feeling D is. \n\nWatch 27 Dresses. That movie is about what a bridesmaid is. It's not something you do for yourself. It's something you do for someone else -- and a KEY part of the experience, historically, is wearing stuff you would NEVER wear under your own direction. You are under your own directly MOST of the time, I imagine. This is a circumstance in which you have agreed to be at her service and part of that is dressing how she asks you to dress. \n\nThe alternative is just never be a bridesmaid. Valid. \n\nBut you should apologize for calling her a bridezilla because nothing she did or said was unreasonable."]}
