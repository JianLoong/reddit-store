When I enter a mosque or temple I take off my shoes. You are complaining about being asked to wear a formal dress (which is gorgeous by the way) because it is not your style.  It's not as if what you are being asked to do is immodest in Indian culture. \n\nYTA.", "YTA. \n\n1) are you white or otherwise differently cultured from the bride? because the outfit you want to wear is v immodest compared to what she wants the bridesmaids to wear/what she herself is wearing. just because it\u2019s vaguely desi doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s her actual culture \ud83e\udd72\n\n2) also, A-lines are probably more readily flattering on most body types than a crop top sari.\n\n3) also also, it doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s \u2018not your religion\u2019 \u2014 it\u2019s HER wedding and you\u2019re invited to participate in an event from HER culture, and if the bride wants her bridesmaids to match/dress modestly then they should without question\u2026.because that\u2019s a normal request from a bride.\n\nhope it\u2019s worth throwing your friendship away i guess??", "YTA. Your job is to support the bride, and that includes wearing the outfit she chooses (within reason, which this is).

More importantly, that dress is damn gorgeous.", "You're a bridesmaid, and she's buying the dresses? Wear the damn dress and stop complaining.\n\nYou have 100% the right to refuse being a bridesmaid though.

It\u2019s the bride\u2019s prerogative to decide what dresses she wants in the wedding. You\u2019re a bad friend for trying to bully her into doing things your way. She is not a bridezilla at all.", "YTA. It's not bridezilla of her to ask to stick to the same dress style, it's actually pretty normal and expected. And yes, there is a notable difference between the outfits in terms of modesty. \n\nYou, of course, have a right to back out of being a bridesmaid over the dress. But do you really  want to throw out a friendship over an outfit you'll wear for several hours?", "YTA.\n\nThe only difference between what you want and what she wants is the exposed flesh. The silhouette is basically the same.\n\nYou can go into the intricacies of modest or not modest all you want, and I suspect I'd fall on your side of it ... but it's not your wedding, and she's not asking that much of you (clothing wise).", "Why on earth is it ok for you to wear a different dress and uncovered abs at someone else\u2019s wedding?", "YTA - its the bride's prerogative to select the dresses that SHE wants for HER wedding.  You don't compromise on this.

First of all, it's become pretty standard custom that the bride gets to choose the bridesmaids' dresses, and unless she demands that they wear something which literally doesn't come in their size, or has a similarly extreme problem, the bridesmaids are expected to shut up and go with it. \n\nI don't necessarily understand the desire, myself. I refused to tell my friends what to wear when it came to my own weddings, and they came in a lovely mismatched collection of whatever they already owned that they felt like wearing that day.\n\nBut this isn't about me, and it isn't about you. It's about the bride at this particular wedding, and she is well within normally acknowledged rights to choose what her bridesmaids wear. \n\nSecond of all, the outfit you want to wear really isn't as modest as the one she chose, and she's within reason to be concerned about that if this is a religious wedding (or even if she, or one of her family members or in-laws whom she wants to appease, is simply a religious person). It doesn't matter that you're not a member of that particular religion -- the people who would be looking at you are, and she has every right to say, \"It will make them, or me, uncomfortable if they have to see *me* present a woman who is immodestly dressed by their standards at *my* wedding. You're welcome to wear whatever you like anyplace else, and I won't judge, but at my own wedding I don't want there to be a religious conflict.\" \n\nEither accept her judgment about what you wear at her wedding with good grace, or else bow out of being a bridesmaid.", "I thought most brides chose the dresses for their bridesmaids. YTA", "I was all ready to say N T A until I saw your pictures. You want to wear a crop top in place of her choice with full coverage and sleeves? \n\nThat is way too drastic a difference. Not to mention how weird it will look to have all the wedding party in those styles and you there with your belly out. \n\nYTA for all that. But if you don't want to wear her dress, then don't be a bridesmaid. But don't be surprised if you're not friends anymore after.", "YTA man Op would it kill you to wear that dress one time on someones wedding holy", "YTA. Her wedding, her choice. The dress she has chosen is beautiful & will complement her dress well. They are miles apart in terms of modesty. Honestly as part of a bridal party you are there to support the bride not to try & look hot anyway. I\u2019ve seen bridesmaids wear worse. If you don\u2019t want to wear the dress then don\u2019t be a bridesmaid.", "YTA, so you want to wear a crop top to her wedding. You\u2019re more than unreasonable. Even without seeing the pictures you were TA, the pictures just proved that you\u2019re an even bigger AH.", "YTA. The dresses are completely different. You obviously won't fit in with your crop top so its better that you back out.", "Haha YTA. Bridesmaidzilla", "YTA. This is a day about her. Not you. Even if you feel like the dress doesn\u2019t compliment you, it\u2019s what she wants and she is the one getting married. I\u2019m a lesbian on the not so fem side and wore a dress for my friend since she wanted all of the bridesmaids to have the same dress. I sucked it up. Because it wasn\u2019t about me. Some brides choose a theme for dresses and others want their bridesmaids to wear the same dress and if that\u2019s what she wants and you want to be her bridesmaid then you should wear it.", "YTA. It\u2019s her special day. She could just cut you out of the wedding. I would.", "YTA. It\u2019s not Bridezilla to want to same dress for everyone. The one you chose is vastly different. Modesty is subjective and if she wants her bridesmaids completely covered, that\u2019s her choice. The one you chose shows a lot of skin  it\u2019s her choice not to allow it. You are making it all about you. It\u2019s not your day.", "YTA. It\u2019s HER wedding. I think the dress she chose for you is absolutely gorgeous!!!!!", "YTA. Her day, her choice. It's not about you at all. Do her a favor and back out now since you really don't understand what your role is as a bridesmaid.", "YTA. The bride gets to pick the outfit. That\u2019s not Bridezilla at all, it\u2019s literally just the norm. Your job as a bridesmaid is to show up in the outfit you were told to wear.", "YTA. There is a clear difference in modesty between the linked dress that D chose, versus the outfit you want to wear. It doesn't matter if you aren't a part of the religion \u2014 D is, and it's up to D what theme or outfit cohesion she wants with her bridal party, since it's her wedding.", "YTA \n\nBasically no bridesmaid in the history of weddings has liked the bridesmaid dress. You suck it up and wear it because *this isn\u2019t about you*. Wearing something different draws attention to yourself, and for what? Because you\u2019re so focused on yourself you haven\u2019t realized that no one else will be? \n\nShe\u2019s making the very standard demands of her bridesmaids that the vast majority of brides make: that you wear the coordinated look with the rest of the wedding party. You are the one causing drama.

She\u2019s not being a bridezilla\u2026 unless the bride says you can choose your own dress, you wear what they picked out. If you don\u2019t wanna do that, don\u2019t be a bridesmaid. You\u2019re there to support the bride on her day.\n\n\nAre bridesmaidzillas a thing?", "YTA it is her wedding and she has the final say. The day is hers to be the center of attention", "YTA, if you won't wear the dress, pull out and let someone who will take your place. Don't personally attack your friend for planning her wedding.", "YTA . Is a bridesmaidzilla a thing? If you don\u2019t want to wear the dress she picked, turn down the offer to be a bridesmaid. But as others have said, it\u2019s about her and not you, and if you care about her, you\u2019ll wear the dress she picked and be supportive.", "YTA. \nIf you don\u2019t see the difference between the two dresses on your own, my explanation won\u2019t help.", "Oh yeah, YTA. If you don't want to wear the outfit, kindly back out now.", "YTA. It doesn\u2019t matter whether you follow that religion or not. It is her wedding and should follow what she sets as guidelines. She\u2019s not acting like a bridezilla, you are just trying to make her out to be one because she\u2019s not going along with your disrespect to her and her religion. You should have respected her wishes. Good for her that she didn\u2019t oblige to your stubbornness and disrespect. It\u2019s her day not yours.", "YTA.  Yes the bridesmaidzilla.  The dress you want to wear is not modest, especially in comparison with the long sleeve bridesmaid dress the bride chose.  Regardless of modest or immodest, the choice is the bride's.  It is her day \n\nMaybe you could try not being a narcissist for at least the day of the wedding.  The day of the wedding, the bride is the main character,  not the guests, not the bridesmaids, not you. Im sure that is difficult for you to comprehend that you will be at an event and not be the focus of everyone's attention.", "YTA. With a friend like you, who needs an enemy? This is her wedding, and she gets to pick the bridesmaid dresses. There\u2019s no compromise here. \n\nAnd the outfit you want is clearly leaps and bounds more immodest than what she has chosen. Suck it up and be there for your friend. Or lose the relationship entirely.", "This is so dumb, of course YTA. \n\nBridesmaids don't (usually) choose the outfit. Either wear what the bride picked or bow out.\n\nThe only 'zilla here is you", "YTA. It\u2019s not about you. If you don\u2019t want to be a bridesmaid, just step down and attend as a guest.", "YTA.  The dress she picked is gorgeous and you want to wear basically a bra top with a skirt.  So inappropriate.\n\nYou sound very entitled.  Just drop out if you can\u2019t respect the brides wishes.", "YTA. Apologize to your friend. If you don\u2019t want to wear it, step down and just attend as a guest.", "YTA. She's not being a bridezilla. This is a perfectly normal request. Plus your choice would likely take attention away from the Bride herself. This doesn't feel like a religious butting of heads and more like you can't stand a moment out of the spotlight. Do everyone a favor and drop out.", "Wow YTA. You make it sound like she wanted you to wear a puke green potato sack. Her choice isn\u2019t that bad. A good friend wouldn\u2019t complain about this, surprised she asked you to be a bridesmaid", "You\u2019re not the main character - stop trying to make her wedding about yourself. YTA", "YTA If you don\u2019t want to wear the bridesmaid\u2019s dress she picked out, then you should bow out of being a bridesmaid. If every single bridesmaid had to be in love with their bridesmaid dress, then we would never have the gem that is the movie 27 Dresses. And then my husband wouldn\u2019t have a secret guilty pleasure movie. Where would we be then?", "YTA. It is better for her to find a friend who actually supports her and wants her day to be perfect. She\u2019s just asking you to wear a full dress instead of a crop top, and you can\u2019t do that for one evening for your so called friend?\n\nEdit: BTW her picking a dress for her bridesmaids is very standard for a bride, and doesn\u2019t make her a bridezilla. I do have a feeling I know who will be one, though\u2026", "Um, that dress absolutely is NOT similar. YTA", "YTA. Brides get to choose the bridesmaid dresses and there\u2019s nothing wrong with what she picked. You just don\u2019t like it. She could pick chartreuse satin ballgowns and she would be well within her rights. You don\u2019t have to like it, it\u2019s not for you. \n\nIf you\u2019re not ok with truly standard parts of being a bridesmaid, you should attend as a guest before you completely blow up your relationship with the bride.", "YTA", "YTA. That's a normal bridesmaid dress. What you are suggesting doesn't fit in with her wedding.", "YTA\n\nWhat you picked is much less modest. At a glance, I'm assuming a Desi wedding and her family might be Muslim.  Bare midriff is gonna be an automatic no-go. If you don't want to wear it, don't be a bridesmaid.", "YTA. You are not the main character. Why are you trying to be? I think that her choice is beautiful, by the way", "YTA. The fit will be weird on you? The dress she picked is beautiful.

I\u2019m speaking as someone who is of desi heritage. I understand that you\u2019d prefer to wear the lehenga. And you\u2019d prefer to be a part of the bridal party. But you can\u2019t have both things. I\u2019ve worn lehengas, salwars, etc. All are beautiful in their own ways. But the lehenga in the pic you provided is not what your friend is comfortable with. These will be in her wedding pics forever and she cares about her bridesmaids being covered. That isn\u2019t brizezilla behavior. So what matters more to you? Wearing the outfit you want or being a bridesmaid. Either answer is fine, but calling your friend names is rude and uncalled for.\n\nEdited to add: as an Indian American you should know how to have some cultural relativism.

Because who cares what I think unless it's my own wedding?", "actually it's a lehenga not a saree, which is still an appropriate wedding attire in general so she is right about it being cultural  \nbut she is obviously ta for complaining when the dress the bride chose has literally no problems and she just wants to wear something revealing   \nalso even though lehenga is the go to wedding attire, a lot of us wear the skirt a little higher and maybe a longer top if we're not comfortable with showing too much skin", "OP points out that the bride is indian but not the same religion which suggests the bride might be muslim.", "It's common for Hindu weddings in India.  Not for Muslim weddings.  It would be absolutely disrespectful to wear that as a bridesmaid to a Muslim bride.", "came here to say this. YTA", "If I had an award, you'd have it now.", "oh come on - you cant give an a$$hole the excuse of an \"illness\". OP is just a selfish prick.", "Plus, it looks cheap compared to the other dresses. I've been to an Indian wedding before and everyone was dressed so elegantly. It was impressive.", "Indian culture is very diverse. This would be considered immodest in many Indian sub cultures. It\u2019s not common to show your midriff and wear sleeveless clothes everywhere in India.", "Thank you for your explanation!", "It's not perfectly fine for Muslim Indians.", "That\u2019s... not modest. At least not for the Tam Brahm Fam\n\n(Meaning the second pic of OP\u2019s choice)", "Totally not modest for many Indians. Unless you wrap the dupatta around like a sari to cover all the midrift.", "I wore this exact outfit to my brothers, friends, cousins etc wedding. However going against brides wishes isn\u2019t great. I just wanted to point out that cultural things are not the same across cultures so if the original commenter doesn\u2019t understand that, they shouldn\u2019t assume!", "Just for fun google \u201ctraditional Indian outfits\u201d and see what comes up \ud83d\ude1c", "I agree. I might also have been swayed  if her body type would look horrible in the dress and it was triggering for OP. However, if OP can pull off the two piece dress, she\u2019ll look great in the bride\u2019s pick. They\u2019re both beautiful, btw. If OP can\u2019t suck it up for one day, she\u2019s not much of a friend.", "And the chosen bridesmaids dress complements so very well!", "DUDE, I reverse image searched the bridesmaid dress and it's like $60. Screw OP, we should ALL get one.", "me too! Both the wedding and bridesmaids dresses are absolutely stunning!", "Most people regardless of color are reasonable and respect the brides preference and I\u2019s say even more so when it is something cultural as most people would want to be respectful.", "I don't mind the matchy matchy - but I'd do what the second bride who I was bridesmaid for did (picked a color, left style up to us) if I ever had a ceremony with a bridal party and maybe have an appointment day for the bridesmaids to pick dresses out after bridal gown day or something.", "Just have the wedding at the beach, venue problem, solved!", "You forgot the drunk karaoke!", "\ud83d\udc4d I love / hate that we have a commonly understood shorthand for this type of behavior.", "...I think it was joke", "Wait. You mean that a nation as big as the Indian ***subcontinent*** has more than one culture?!? I\u2019m shocked\u2026 /s", "OP is still an asshole btw. just providing some context because to me i was actually surprised the bride said it was immodest", "Got it! Thank you \u2661", "what are they \"assuming\"? It's still a crop top by definition.", "I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s not a traditional outfit, but that doesn\u2019t take away from the fact that it is also a crop top", "That was my thought. I don't see how the bride's choice would be unflattering when OP is happy to show their midriff. The only issue I could possibly see is maybe OP has a short torso and high waist and the dress the bride picked looks more suited for someone with a long torso and  low waist.. But I would think that's something that could be addressed with tailoring\n\nEdit: I went back and looked at the dress again and I think I was wrong. Looks like an a-line style dress which is *made* to suit basically any figure", "The bridesmaid dresses ARE a perfect complement! The bride has amazing taste.  This wedding is going to be breathtaking. \ud83d\ude0d", "Well sure, no one said otherwise. But when we are presented with someone who is NOT respecting the bride's culture, it is relevant to find out whether it's out of ignorance or malice.", "Problem solved! Carry on, handsome journalist who may have read u/allmykidsareheathens comment.", "*HOW COULD I FORGET THE DRUNK KARAOKE?!* \n\nShame on me.", "If the bride is Muslim, which is seems is likely from the post, then it\u2019s understandable why she wouldn\u2019t want her bridesmaid to wear a sleeveless lehenga", "I assumed OP might have been Muslim, in which case they probably would consider it immodest.  Especially if the family is a bit more conservative", "Tbh, my best friend is a Punjabi Hindu and when I read what OP wrote before looking at what the bride originally requested I thought it was the color that was the problem \ud83d\ude02 \n\nBut, as someone else mentioned, there are different cultures across India and then on top of that not every one wants to follow tradition.", "No worries!! Happy to have a civil discussion on Reddit lmao", "This comment somehow has the same energy as random white celebrities wearing indigenous cultures head gear to music festivals and calling them costumes \ud83d\ude02", "Right?  I so want to go to this wedding!  It will be AWESOME!", "You guys have me cracking up!", "yes i agree", "Interesting. Your comment gives off the same energy as someone deflecting when realizing they\u2019re wrong", "We need to find out if the bride has a Reddit username name, contact her, smooze her, become her friends and bring up the idea of us going to wedding\u2026 OP would know what if she has had a username but I don\u2019t she wants to help us\u2026. She\u2019s probably in a bad mood now\u2026 I also REALLY want to go the wedding as well!"]}
