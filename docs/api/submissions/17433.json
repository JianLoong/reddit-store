He's a great coworker and is excellent at his job.  We've worked together for a little over 5 years.  Dave is in a wheelchair.  If you ask him about it, he'll tell you that he's a disabled veteran.  However, his disability isn't service related.\n\nRecently we've finished a job for a big client under time and under budget.  The company gave our team big bonus checks last week and our manager thought we should all go to a steakhouse to celebrate.  A few of us decide to go to a local brewery afterwards.  I have a coworker give me a ride after dropping my car off at home.\n\nAt the brewery I start chatting with this woman let's call her Amy.  Amy and I really hit it off.  She's there with some friends and we all end up sitting at a table.  One of Amy's friends is being really friendly with Dave.  Amy and I get up to get another drink.  I mention how her friend seems to like Dave.  Amy says her friend also served and Dave is a disabled veteran.  Probably because I had been drinking, I tell her a secret.  Dave's disability is from a drunk driving accident, not service.\n\nAfter that round, Amy and her friends go to use the restroom.  When they get back, Amy says it was nice chatting and says she still wants to keep talking to me.  I go sit with them for the rest of the evening.  Amy's friend is pissed about him not telling the truth and calling himself a disabled veteran.  Her friends talked her out of telling him off and making a scene.\n\nMonday at work one of my coworkers asks if they did something to piss them off.  I tell them the story.   Later Dave comes over and calls me an asshole, goes off about how hard it is to find people who are willing to date someone in a wheelchair and tells me to mind my own business.  I apologized and said I shouldn't have said anything, but considering how pissed off she got, maybe it was something Dave should have told her.  Dave says screw you and leaves.  It's become somewhat of an office gossip subject, and I've heard different opinions from my coworkers against my will.  Reddit, AITA?\n\nEDIT: To clarify, yes, Dave did serve. But according to Amy's friend (I don't know that much about it) disabled veteran means disabled due to service. Otherwise it's a NSR (non-service related) disability which is a different classification by the VA.  Dave has a DUI, he was drunk driving.  According to him his vehicle went off road and he hit a tree.", "created_utc": 1684286488, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13jn9vv/aita_for_telling_someone_why_my_coworker_is/", "score": 433, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He isn't a disabled veteran, he is a veteran who is disabled. Sure it wasn't your place as other people mentioned but you surely saved them both a lot of time. When you say you are a disabled veteran (at least in the US) it is VERY implied you were disabled while serving, not while in a drunk driving accident.", "[deleted]", "I'm honestly on the fence... I know everyone else is going straight for you being the AH but at the same time, lying about your past like that is a real AH move. Especially if you know someone or have someone in your life who's been affected or killed by drunk driving, it's no wonder that people don't respond well to that and get angry. It would be an immediate no for me and if I were her, I would want to know that info.\n\nOn the other hand, it wasn't really your business and not your story to tell. If it were someone that you were close with, I would understand you wanting them to have that information, but this was a friend of a coworker you hardly knew.\n\nOverall, I'm gonna say ESH", "To be very honest with you, I don't think so.  I think what Dave is doing is wrong and disrespectful to actual veterans. What was going to happen when the lie fell apart? It seems like he makes himself the victim of everything without taking the consequences of his own actions into account. He wants the air of character and bravery but hasn't actually exemplified either one, This isn't your fault.", "NTA. I dunno\u2026 with this particular lie, it feels a bit like \u2018stolen valour\u2019.  If I was another veteran, I would feel pretty mislead. \n\nAlso, he was using it as a lie to pick up women!? Jfc. You\u2019re never the asshole when you warn someone that they\u2019re being lied to.", "He is a disabled veteran (OP says he served), but his disability isn't connected to serving in the military. He's very clearly relying on people hearing \"disabled veteran\" and making the reasonable assumption that those two things are connected in order to get laid. Sure, it's not OP's story to tell, but she noticed him lying and spoke up. Would *you* be happy about someone deliberately misleading you to get in your pants? NTA.", "ETA: ESH. Dave is being deliberately misleading to lure women, which is very disgusting. But your motivation wasn't \"This guy is genuinely a creep, and your friend should know about it.\" It was \"I'm drunk and spilling someone else's secrets to a girl I like.\" Did this info need to come out? Yes. Was that any part of why you did it? Apparently no. Do some introspection, OP, because it sounds like you did the right thing for dickish reasons, but at least you did the right thing, and here's hoping you can work out how to do that for the sake of other people and not because you gossip when you drink.\n\n\nINFO: Dave was \"injured in a drunk driving accident?\" Is that all you know about it? Those words? Because I know a guy who died in a drunk driving accident. He wasn't the drunk driver.\nIf he was driving drunk, I'll say ESH, because he's an asshole for driving drunk, and you're an asshole for spreading that around just to be petty when the only good reason to share it is if he still does it and is a danger to others. \nIf you don't know, then YTA, because scaring someone off of a guy she liked when he might well have been a VICTIM is some top-tier crap.\n\nAlso, he is KINDA technically a disabled veteran. He is a veteran, and he is disabled. But that's pretty misleading, since his disability is not service-related, and the general usage is in the benefits-eligibility sense, so he does suck for that one way or another. But that's a general sucking, not necessarily an in-this-specific-situation sucking. He is lying to women by permitting an incorrect assumption based on intentionally using a term in a non-standard way, and that's shitty. So ON THE WHOLE, everyone sucks here. But the way you tell this, you ONLY snitched on him because a woman liked him and you were drunk, AND you might have given a different wrong impression of him, depending on how his accident actually happened. Not a good look.\n\nEDIT: Actually, you know that he's in a wheelchair due to a drunk driving accident, but you don't actually say whether he HAS disabled veteran status. That's also important. Does he definitely NOT have a service-related disability in addition to his mobility problems? It doesn't sound like you like this guy much at all, so I wouldn't be surprised if there's something more he just never disclosed to you.", "It wasn't really your story to tell, so YTA.", "ESH \u2014 Dave is obviously being deliberately misleading but it also wasn\u2019t OP\u2019s part to share this info", "Soft YTA\u2026\n\nPerhaps Dave\u2019s drinking is from trauma he suffered during his military service.

My body is trashed.  None of my surgeries are a\u2026direct\u2026result of an injury but years of abuse to my body.", "YTA - Not your story to tell, ever. Don't justify your action citing how 'pissed off' someone was. Take full responsibility for your words. You are an ahole.\n\nFact: David is a Veteran. People who assume facts about his disability means the fault lies the them & their assumptions. Just like most new people we meet, as time goes by Dave holds the right to clarify aspects of his life but you do not. Your words are a breach of trust and an intrusion in his life. Know better. Do better.", "Yeah, YTA. I'd say it's his business what he wants to share with whom. You also say you mentioned the DIY after you'd been drinking, suggesting it's not something you'd ordinarily say. You should've minded yr own business. Since you work together, you could try apologizing and seeing if you can make it up to him somehow.", "YTA.  Never your place to tell someone else why someone is disabled.  A disabled veteran doesn\u2019t mean someone who was disabled in service, it\u2019s a veteran who is disabled.  Not to mention there are other types of disability that can\u2019t be seen.", "not your circus, not your monkeys. You didn\u2019t have to involve yourself. This is a coworker and you should work on being professional with your coworkers. YTA\n\nEdited to add a comment I made in a different part of the thread:\n\nHe could also be sick or traumatized about talking about his accident. A quick \u201cdisabled in service,\u201d most of the time does not get any follow up questions and he doesn\u2019t have to be retraumatized every time someone asks. People will ask you invasive questions all the time when you\u2019re disabled. To a future partner he might disclose his actual accident in private.\n\nEdit to your edit. You made it seem like it was just a accident involving a drunk driver, not that he was a driver. I\u2019m not excusing him drinking and driving, but it can be way more complex than we know. He could have been dealing with a drinking problem caused by ptsd of his service.", "YTA. Stop spreading rumors and snitching. Gossiping is  the worst.", "INFO: Did you hear Dave state he is a disabled Veteran?  \n\nIf so, do you understand he can be a veteran and acquire his disability during active duty or post separation?  The term is accurate in both scenarios.", "YTA. He\u2019s disabled and a veteran, so he\u2019s a disabled veteran. Just because it\u2019s not service connected doesn\u2019t change either of those descriptors. You interfered in the development of his relationship and never gave him an opportunity to clarify.", "YTA, wtf OP?!\n\nIt is not your story to tell. You ruined his reputation and his friend's trust in him! You should have minded your own business. Try apologizing...", "YTA.  You have your nose where it doesn't belong!", "YTA so you\u2019re judge jury and executioner because you know a couple things about another equally complex persons past?

But after he explained that he doesn't need the added obstacle of explaining the worst mistake of his life to women he's just met, you should have just apologized and dropped it there.  \n\nFollowing up your apology with a judgmental criticism about how Dave handled meeting  this woman, was pretty insensitive considering how  much fear of judgment he clearly still lives with. He also didn't need his anxiety reinforced about how poorly some women will react to how he wound up in the chair. \n\nThere's also a thing where people have a tendency to talk down to people in wheelchairs.

That would still more honest than saying he was injured in the line of duty.", "Lying about something such as drunk driving would also be a turn off for me. \n\nIf you are irresponsible enough to lie about how you get injured to make yourself seem heroic then you are an ass. When I\u2019m reality so many people have died due to reckless drivers \n\nYou were also a bit tipsy so maybe didn\u2019t fully process that is was bad to say. \n\nEven though it wasn\u2019t your truth to tell I think it\u2019s an important enough truth, and that the only reason he doesn\u2019t like you sharing it is because he looks bad and now he lost a date.

His disability is his own consequence and it\u2019s well deserved IMO, because too often do drunk drivers disable or KILL other innocent drivers. Yes it\u2019s hard as a disabled person to date and find real connections, but that doesn\u2019t exempt you from the evil shit you\u2019ve done lol, and he knows that - which is why he lies by omission.", "YTA.

That\u2019s something private about a mistake he\u2019s made in his past. Whether I think it\u2019s right or not, it makes sense that he wouldn\u2019t be entirely honest about it. It\u2019s his decision when he wants to share that information with a partner. I\u2019ve got some dark things in my past and it took me six months to share that information with my boyfriend, and I sure as hell would *never* share that on the first date. Is it a bit of an AH move to call yourself a \u201cdisabled veteran,\u201d maybe.

He literally wrote,  \u201cProbably because I had been drinking, I tell her a secret.\u201d He didn\u2019t do it because of some moral compass or to stand up for what is right. Not justifying Dave, but again, this sub is AITA and OP was one, in my opinion.", "Yes, but none of this is OP\u2019s to share. Even if it was a battle story, other people\u2019s disabilities and reasons behind them aren\u2019t yours to tell.

I'm currently in the military and if I found out someone was essentially saying they were a disabled veteran when asked about a specific thing like said wheelchair and that's not the actual case I would be so pissed like the female veteran was. \n\nAnd I am sure he may have another disability it's the fact that he is making it seem like the military put him in a wheelchair and not his actions to make himself look better. And most veterans with PTSD or other disabilities that are considered small (like breaking a bone, hearing loss, etc.) don't say that they are a disabled veteran unless it is specifically asked. My uncle broke his back while he was in service and never once have I heard him call himself a disabled veteran, just a veteran.", "Honestly, I feel like guys like Dave are likely sick of people leading their first meeting with \u201chow did you end up in a wheel chair\u201d and has shortened the answer that makes people stop asking more intrusive questions around his trauma. These are subjects than can be covered when you actually know someone.", "Dave is pretty much lying to get pity sex and attention, his drunk driving crippled him, he had it coming using the phrase \"disabled veteran\" as if service is what put him in a chair.", "I understand your point, but at the same time, he was watching a woman be lied to and taken advantage of. If you see something, say something.", "OP says accident happened due to Dave being drunk.

If everyone asked you the same question about a traumatic event in your life, you might shorten that answer as well.", "This isn't about how he chooses to share the story of how he became disabled.

I am, in fact, a disabled veteran.

You don't have to make up lies or confess your sins.\n\nThis was a deliberate scam in order to get laid and that's so disgusting. OP probably should not have disclosed the DUI status, but informing the women he was scamming was the right call. Just saying he is lying about his backstory and that he did not get disabled due to combat is enough.", "NTA.

Not just with woman. My guess is Dave is likely tired of being asked upon first meeting of anyone \u201cso how did you end up in a wheel chair?\u201d So he has shortened it to stop a long line of very rude questioning. This is how people treat those with visible disabilities, like they have the right to ask a series of private questions right off the bat. Many folks having coping tools to combat that.  So I do believe it\u2019s about how Dave chooses to share.\n\nOp did not say he tells a big tale about being wounded in battle, he simply said \u201cDave says he\u2019s a disabled veteran.\u201d Is he relying on a technicality? Sure! Does this likely stop intrusive questioning? Absolutely.", "Truthfully he should just tell them to fuck off for being rude, but not everyone is that forward. Right or wrong, \u201ctraumatic car accident\u201d will prompt more questions from rude folks. Disabled veteran typically doesn\u2019t. People mind their manners more with this statement. Since he also does it at work, seems like a way to skirt the third degree from folks that believe they get to ask visibly disabled folks \u201cwhat happened??\u201d when they don\u2019t even know him.

They don\u2019t magically have their libidos stop working after an accident, and it\u2019s a blood flow to the area thing, as well as tested working properly.  \n\nWheelchair users (including paraplegics) can and do have sex all the time, including kinky sex.

However: there's a big difference between disabled veteran - which 100% means was disabled in the line of duty, and veteran who is also disabled. There's no shame in being the latter, but claiming to be the former is absolutely stolen valour from the perspective of armed services, and he for sure knows it.", "1, not your business how disabled people's genitals work, weird question.\n\n2, not everyone who uses a wheelchair is paralyzed.

Still no one is owed that explanation.", "OP specifically said that when Dave expressed his anger, he launched into how hard it is for someone to find dates when they're disabled.  The truth is that it's Dave's own fault he's disabled. He got drunk, He crashed, he can't walk anymore. To potential dates that is one big Red Flag.  So he pretties it up and pretends he became disabled not due to his own recklessness but  due to serving the country because it sounds more heroic. This isn't to stop intrusive questioning. It's to improve dating chances and seem like a way better person than he actually is, using dishonesty.", "It seems awfully convenient if the only answer he can give that doesn\u2019t have follow up questions is one that paints him in a completely misleading positive light.", "Yup that\u2019s all I can think too.", "Hi, you're actually talking to someone who has broken their spine. Never felt the need to lie about it to get babes though.", "No-one is owed an explanation, sure. But it's still an asshole move to lie about it. You can also just say \"I don't like to talk about it\".", "He said it in that setting, yes, as flirting is what was occurring at the moment,  but he also doesn\u2019t share this widely. Nor should he have to. Do you share all of your medical and mental health history while flirting? Or with your coworkers? Would you appreciate it if your coworker knew this and shared it for you, because maybe it\u2019s a red flag? Dave can\u2019t cover this up so easily, so it sounds like he found a rude question silencer. \n\nMy point still stands, I don\u2019t believe Dave needs to hang a sign on the back of his chair that reads \u201cdui\u201d. You don\u2019t know how old he was, or what he has done with his life since. He\u2019s got a reminder of it daily, I don\u2019t think he has to beg new people for forgiveness when they rudely ask \u201cwhat happened???\u201d He JUST met this person, I don\u2019t believe people are owed your life story upon their first interaction. You certainly aren\u2019t owed detailed reasons for disability upon first interaction. I\u2019m just saying, the answer does stop the rude questioning of strangers. Is it right? I don\u2019t know. But it does sound effective", "Sure, he should probably tell people rude enough to ask to fuck off, but some people aren\u2019t good at asserting themselves and making others uncomfortable. I\u2019m not saying he\u2019s perfect, I\u2019m not even saying he is right or wrong, he\u2019s hanging on a language technicality, I\u2019m just saying I see how this shuts down the questioning quick without feeling like you\u2019re being unkind. Regardless, it\u2019s not other\u2019s to share for him.", "Nobody thinks that Dave needs to hang a sign on his chair but I'm fairly certain a lot of people would have a problem with finding out that Dave lied to them about being disabled due to service in the military when he wasn't and is only doing so to hide a very concerning fact.  People aren't owed your life story but it isn't ok to tell them a pack of huge lies to make yourself seem heroic, especially  just to date."]}
