Let's call his friend James. Before this trip, I have already noticed James dropping some subtle jokes here and there about the inferiority of women, example, we played a board game once where he insisted it had to be males vs. females, and when they beat us in one round (we won the other rounds), he made a comment like, \"It is like taking candy from a baby!\" Stuff like that. \n\nAnyway, fast forward to this trip. Started off well, but again noticed he would make such comments at least once a day. We played charades where he again asked to do it males vs. females, and when they won, he mentioned a few hours later, \"The highlight was getting to beat women.\" Another time, my boyfriend and I were pretending to play fight (our thing), and my boyfriend then said \"I'd be a real piece of shit if this was for real.\" And then James chimes in, \"As far as I am concerned you are the piece of shit for not following through with it for real. Ha ha.\" All smiles and jokey. But really? \n\nI was mainly upset at my boyfriend for reacting passively and sometimes laughing along politely as well, so I finally told him to tell James this is not OK and it makes me uncomfortable. James then texted me a civil apology along the lines of \"I am sorry you got offended but I want to clear the air.\" Privately though, my boyfriend showed me their text conversation where James said things like \"Dude I am not OK apologising over a few jokes. That's not cool man. Why do women do that man? But anyway my girlfriend is no better with drama.\" BLOOD BOILED as soon as I saw that. I then texted back an extremely direct reply to him saying his apology is insincere and if he doesn't understand how annoying his comments are for any self-respecting woman to listen to on the daily, I have nothing to say to him and I will never see him again.\n\nAlso keep in mind, a few days prior, he had a massive fight with his girlfriend where she packed her bags and was ready to leave the holiday. I had to track her down, and console her woman-to-woman, try to explain his point of view and get her to return. It makes me even angrier James has not an ounce of empathy for him making me feel uncomfortable, who has been nothing but nice to him thus far, and even helped with his argument. Is it so hard to say \"I didn't mean to offend, but I get it and will not make these comments in front of her anymore.

He should have stamped on this before it got that far.", "NTA. The first rule of making inappropriate jokes is that the second someone tells you they're uncomfortable, you stop.\n\nThe dude used \"beat women\" as a punchline. He told your BF to be physically violent with you. He sent a female friend to bring back his ex, instead of engaging with her like an adult.\n\nThese are warning signs that James might be an abuser. (He might also be an asshole). I'd maybe check up on his girlfriend, though, just to make sure that she's okay and safe", "Nta, it sounds like his friend likes to hurt women emotionally and then play victim. Not what you or your bf  need to be around", "NTA. James was an AH for the jokes, for the fake appologies (\"I'm sorry you got offended\" blames you, the right thing to say is \"I'm sorry I said things that made you uncomfortable\") and for the texts to your bf. Do yourself one better and stop seeing that guy.", "NTA. This kind of snide putdown disguised as jokes is AH behavior any day. You did the right thing here, and the fact that James can't own up to his shitty behavior probably means he's not worth either of your time.", "NTA. The guy clearly has real issues with women, and I can't really understand why you would convince his gf not to leave. But whether said in a \"joking\" way or not, most of them definitely aren't jokes, especially condoning physical violence to women.", "INFO: What happened between his girlfriend and him? It must have been pretty bad if she was willing to leave..\n\nI assume I'm missing some context here because I don't see why you'd defend the pig when he treats other girls badly and then get offended when he does the same to you.\n\nNTA for cutting him off though", "NTA of course, but also FYI: \"I am sorry you got offended but I want to clear the air\" is not a civil apology, it's an accusation. It contains two parts: 1) YOUR reaction is the problem and 2) despite that, I (not you) am the bigger person by talking about how you're the problem.\n\nA good apology contains all of the following: 1) Acknowledging the damage caused (e.g. \"you were hurt and felt unsafe around me\") 2) Identifying what the apologizing person did wrong (e.g. \"I made jokes that rely on centuries of discrimination as their punchline, which reproduces and perpetuates outdated ideologies\") 3) Reasons for the behaviour, but not excuses (e.g. \"I have internalized misogynistic worldviews\") 4) What's different now (e.g. \"And since realizing that, I have read up on my issues online and reflected on them, and realized I was wrong. In the future, I'll refrain from making these jokes\")", "ESH\n\nWhy you didnt say anything?\n\n\nYou cant laugh about his jokes all the time and say nothing about it and then escalate it via SMS while you are together on holidays.\n\nYou are totally immature.

It's clear from how he reacted to my boyfriend, the person closest to him, that he would still have had an asshole reaction. And who said I did it via text?
