I honestly have never understood why other women think they\u2019re cute by acting this way. It\u2019s really irritating and immature behavior.", "NTA, but if you noticed the mind game already, you should have done that every single time it happened since now. Don\u2019t let her think that acting that way is acceptable by always giving in, waiting for her taking forever to decide etc. You proposed, she said no, you proceeded. This should just be your normal routine. If sometimes you want to be nice and still bring her something, why not. It would be different if she just asked you to bring her anything, because anything is something, so she would have asked. But don\u2019t let unhealthy habits install into your relationship, especially if you know she does it on purpose, expecting you to figure it out.", "NTA\n\nI hate this insipid game of \u2018guess what I have want when I don\u2019t even know what I want.\u2019 As a society, we need to do better at communicating our wants and needs more directly, and also not negatively judging people when they are direct.", "Tell her you left her food at the corner of \"I don't want anything \" and \"Why didn't you get me something\" \n\nThose streets can be found on the roundabout in the town of \"Nobody is a mind reader\" \n\nSeriously,  what kind of nonsense is that?

She literally said she didn't want anything, so the only person she has a reason to be upset with is herself. You're not responsible for feeding her and she didn't ask you to get her something. And it sounds like she's perfectly capable of going out and getting her own food.", "NTA\n\nIf she said she didn't want anything, she has to own that. It sounds more like an attempt to manufacture something to be mad about in place of something that would be unreasonable to be mad about that she did not want to articulate.", "NTA, she\u2019s a child. It\u2019s boring. Pandering to these games is not your responsibility and will get old, quickly.", "NTA", "NTA - you asked her and she said she didn\u2019t want anything. Not your fault you took her at her word.", "NTA. Especially because you stated that she has played this \"game\" before. Not everyone has the patience to humor other people's indecisiveness when they're hungry and tired. Maybe she will be courteous and mature next time and give you an actual answer that she means. If not, that is no one's problem but hers.", "NTA but you could have made it clear you're not playing, since you know that she does this. saying something like \"if you don't ask for anything i will not get you anything, i'm tired and hungry and in no mood to be cutesy\" would have preemted this reaction and probably avoided the conflict.", "Totally NTA. FAFO man.", "NTA, you asked. She said no. You only would have been TA if you didn't ask.", "NTA this has always been one of the dumbest things I hear about people doing.\n\nIf you want food **fucking ask for it**. Don't be all \"no I'm fine\" and then try to eat the other person's food. Unacceptable behavior lol", "NTA \n\nBut you are asking for trouble. I am not saying condone the behavior.

She very easily could have told you, \u201cI want X.\u201d And if she doesn\u2019t like the place you chose, why would she want food from there anyway? Good grief.", "NTA. She should use her words and say what she wants.", "NTA, why say you don't want anything and then turn around and get mad at you for not getting her anything? Sounds like she is looking for a reason to get mad at you. You did the right thing though by putting your foot down and not letting her get away with that. If you didn't, she would push the envelope and do that every time.", "NTA but next time warn her that \"No\" means you're not getting any of mine. And stick to it.

And please keep buying food for you only when she plays this game. Maybe she will learn to decide or stop the games.", "NTA - and well played, sir.  Well played.", "NTA. People who pull shit like that should be completely shunned by society and made to stand in the corner when they do it. No one worth knowing would do something that obnoxious.", "NTA. Maybe she'll learn from tjis.", "NTA, don't play the mind game with her. Either she wants something and should say such, or doesn't. You're not a telepathist. She could've even texted you if her mind changed and/or asked if you could grab her a snack.", "NTA\n\nYou are not a mind reader.\nShe is a big girl and either needs to say what she wants or accept that you will take her at her word when she says nothing.", "Unless your gf is 14 you've got a long row to hoe, dear.

If you want something, say so, if you don\u2019t, don\u2019t try to eat mine. You said you weren\u2019t hungry, that\u2019s a YOU problem.", "Mostly NTA, she should have expressed that she wanted something. Since she told you she didn't want anything, she didn't get anything. \n\nTelling her to go and get it was definitely rude, and you seem to know your partner well enough to know she would have liked something. Making a second stop isn't a huge deal. \n\nNTA, but not thoughtful. She should have used her words.", "NTA - but if there was no food and you know the game she plays, you should have gotten something for \"yourself\" then gave it to her - which would have made you 'thoughtful and sweet'.  Lesson learned?", "Just throwing this out there: For many women, sharing food is an indicator of intimacy. So, on one hand, a woman will decline food, then want to eat from her partner's plate in order to gauge the level of intimacy in the relationship. It's infuriating, but it may also be an explanation...?", "NTA but remember yall are in a relationship, and do you really want this to be the way your relationship goes? Is this the hill you wanna die on? Is it worth ending up single?", "Me either. Like they get to overrule their partners and take their food. It\u2019s selfish and far from cute.", "I'm a woman and I also find this very irritating.

Their food kinda sux. We just had that last week. etc etc etc.\n\nMe: Fine you pick.\n\nDad/Bro: Ok, we'll think about it and get back to you.  \n\nThey don't.

OP shouldn't have to go get food for her after.", "The lesson to me would be she is high maintenance and run.  The GF should learn", "So be manipulative and enable her existing bad behavior. Any more stellar advice for this guy?", "What? No, that's terrible advice.. \n\nOP has no lesson to learn here, because OP did nothing wrong. \n\nThey're both adults, he asked if she wanted something,  she said no. \n\nBuying something for \"himself\" just to give to her is just letting her think this behavior is fine. It's not fine,  OP has talked to her about it before and she still does it. She should not be encouraged.", "> you should have gotten something for \"yourself\" then gave it to her\n\nNo. She should be an adult and ask for food if she's hungry instead of saying she doesn't want anything.", "I said there was nothing filling. We had food but nothing to fill you up after a long cardio work out.", "That\u2019s fine, but tell me you want food", "If she breaks up with him because he didn't get her the thing she said she didn't want,  then bullet dodged for OP. \n\nA discussion should be had for sure, but OP did absolutely nothing wrong here.", "You did the right thing. I used to pull the same crap when I was a kid and into my early 20s, not because I thought it was cute or because I enjoyed playing games but because of childhood damage. But after going hungry a few times I realized people were genuinely offering, it wasn't a bad thing to accept or to be hungry. \n\nNot saying that's what your girlfriends deal is, but hopefully after doing this a couple more times she'll just say what she wants.", "NTA\n\nI was ready yo call you an AH until I got to the part where she said she didn\u2019t want anything.  That\u2019s her problem at that point", "NTA, she was taken at her word, so she needs to grow up and deal with the choice she made!", "NTA, she's a grown individual who is able to communicate her wants and needs.

You asked if she wanted anything, she said no, she didn\u2019t get anything. Then she\u2019s mad at you? That\u2019s immature and unreasonable. You said you have spoken to her about this issue before and she\u2019s still doing it, so you have no choice but to take action\u2026in the form of listening to what she said a.
