But then go on to say she's becoming unable to shop at Costco, because of various infirmities. If you're there to do the physical things she can't do, then why would taking her into the store not be on your list? You had to go and find her and she had panicked.  I don't think you can really dictate to her how she gets her social life, if she finds shopping in Costco suits her, I don't think you should take that away from her. If you really refuse to go in there is there someone else close by who might be able to take her along? Otherwise, I'd say just do it, it'll only take a couple of hours of your time and will make her happy. Two hours out of your day will make an old woman happy. So yes, YTA, sorry.", "YTA. Let me repeat, YTA. Your elderly grandma with vision problems and PTSD loves Costco. Who tf cares that you don't like it. Maybe the employees find your grandmother delightful and enjoy interacting with her. I get not wanting to spend hours cruising the aisles, but maybe if you went in, the process would be quicker. It would definitely be safer for her. Shopping is a social event for her. It's cruel to take it away from her. Shame on you.

Which to me would include taking her places as she isnt able to navigate them on her own. Suck it up, take her shopping and be glad you can still spend time with her.

She doesn\u2019t have much time left - you should use it to prioritize her time over yours. If you love her (even if she has narcissistic tendencies) just give her this.  Set some boundaries with her and let her know you can only invest X hours per week at Costco.  Let her enjoy what is left of her life without trying to control it because you don\u2019t share her values. \n\nYou will regret it later - feeling guilty when she\u2019s gone.

After that Costco visit it\u2019s now clear you can\u2019t leave your grandmother on her own in Costco anymore. One of the most challenging parts of caring for aging relatives is knowing when to respect their independence and autonomy and when you need to step in and insist on helping. \n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean you have to cater to everything your grandmother wants or exactly when she wants it but you do need to make sure she is safe. Maybe the solution is to go to Costco less often but still accompany her or something like that.\n\nIt really sounds like your grandmother is bored and wants more social interaction. It might help to see if there are any resources in your area she can use. I do not know what city you are in but many community centers and libraries in the United States have senior specific events and programming. Some cities even have community centers that are dedicated to the needs of seniors. \n\nMaybe you can look up some options and then talk with her about what programming or events she might enjoy.", "YTA\n\nIn almost any other circumstance, I\u2019d say NTA because I fucking loathe Costco. \n\nBut, this is the deal you made.

Both my husband's and my grandmas had really hard lives and only occasionally shared their memories and I know there was more to learn.\n\nYTA.

She wants to maintain her independence. To you she is 84. Her body is 84 too. But her heart is not. It is probably 20. She wants to enjoy her life. Not stay cooped up at home waiting to die. That is why she chats with the staff at Costco. That is why she tells you that it is her way of socialising. \n\nGo in and protect your Grandma.

Sounds like fun.", "Take her in to Costco and help her at her own pace. Do not try to speed things up, HELP HER. Pick up stuff and put it in the cart. Help at checkout which is a bear at Costco.

She will be gone soon, how will you feel knowing you deprived her of one of her last pleasures. If it really is taking too long, tell her you will go on Saturday at 5pm so you can urge her out when they are closing, it still gives her an hour but not two hours.

Do better you selfish person.", "Info: is your grandmother a Holocaust survivor?", "Go in with your grandmother, wtf.", "Gentle YTA - you agreed to this arrangement. \nHowever, she does have limitations. It may be time to ask Grandma what she gets and wants out of the trip. \n\nIf this is her major social outing - let it be so! Start early. Have a sit at the food court before you shop. Talk to her about your week, what that couple over there could possibly be doing with three ficus trees and a box of clearance Christmas bulbs. Whatever. \n\nCould you divide the list? Perhaps she gets one cart and can chat with staff and get the perishable items, while you zoom through and get the shelf-stable items. You can also offer to bring the cart to her to check that it\u2019s all right. That way you feel productive and she gets a smaller, more manageable list but still gets her social interaction\u2026AND you\u2019re close enough to help. Also, her brand-loyalty won\u2019t be as bad with perishable items. \n\nExplain to her that you WANT to help her. You are GLAD she likes going and socializing - but this is not just about Costco. \n\nMath it out for her. You spend X time commuting to work. You spend X time working. You then spend X time shopping. Tell her that you\u2019re happy to shop on (tues, thurs, Sat) but would rather spend time with her at home (mon, wed, fri, sun).  Ask her to cook with you. Sit and watch a movie/show together. Whatever. \n\nPerhaps divide it - for the weekly sales you pick up x store and y store, you shop together at z store and Costco. \n\nShe sounds lonely. Maybe instead of dumping her off at the senior center, take her someplace she can have interactions - or go with her to the senior center until she makes friends.  \n\nYour grandmother will not be around forever and the guilt will eat at you after, especially because if you do not take steps to alleviate your irritation you will feel relieved - and the guilt from *that* is horrible. You and she both deserve better.", "YTA. Calculate the fair market value of the rent you're not paying and the fair market value of the time you spend helping her.  My guess is that the value of your time is far less than the unpaid rent.\n\nI sympathize, though. If your grandma is particular about finding everything on her list, it would be frustrating to go to Costco. Those assholes intentionally rearrange the store every day to make you hunt for everything.  That's not the place to go if you're adamant about finding everything.  But, you're probably not going to get an 84-year-old to see the logic in that.", "Look, I get, I really do as I take my 85 y.o. Mom to the grocery store. I know full well this will take as long as it takes because she loves to poke around, go down each aisle because what if there is something new, chat with the deli man, the cheese lady, etc. After the store we go to the pharmacy and do it all over again. This gives her some semblance of the independence she once had and desperately misses.  \nYou are making her navigate one of those huge carts, at her age, unstable, with PTSD, partially blind and alone.  \nShame on you. YTA", "NAH   Everyone is acting like OP is just doing two hours a week at Costco but it\u2019s more than that. Pharmacy, Groceries and miscellaneous trips, probably some doctors visits. I know whenever my grandmother would have us over for a quick favor it would turn into four hours every time. \n\nIt\u2019s not grandma\u2019s fault that\u2019s her preference and she\u2019s entitled to her fun assuming she\u2019s not bothering the staff, but it\u2019s not unreasonable for OP to have boundaries.", "Nor sure if anyone pointed this out but, based on who was in power in 38. This makes sense. Grandma doesn't want to admit she needs help because they used to \" put down\" people who weren't perfect or who got old and needed help. I get where you are frustrated. My grandpa and another family member both had MDB and it was not fun.if you know what the lost should be I'd try and pre-shop as much as you can.

I disagree.\n\nI think you're at your wits end, as many caregivers are today. Yes, you're saving on rent, but you're performing an invaluable role as primary caregiver for your grandmother - a huge burden.\n\nLook, I think you need to use some of the money you're saving on rent towards your grandma's care. If you can't stand being in Costco for that long, you need to hire a granny-sitter for the visits.\n\nTaking care of our ageing family isn't a transactional business (no rent vs caregiving). Taking care of her is your duty. Perform it with compassion for her - and for yourself. It is hard when the elderly are irrational and obstinate, so please spend some money to make your job easier.\n\nAll the best.", "This sounds exactly like my FIL.

Genuinely? You would literally rather let your disabled grandmother RISK HURTING HERSELF than to sit through two hours of shopping with her. You would rather deny your grandmother the NECESSARY socialization that SHE PREFERS because it's inconvenient to you. You would rather let complete strangers huff and puff at her for shit she can't control, than to be by her side and advocate for her if she needs it. You're okay to sit in the car while your grandmother is alone close to a panic attack because you don't want to waste time. You're okay with denying your grandmother possibly one of the few things that she has left of her independence because it's a hassle.\n\nYour grandmother needs you and all you have to do is take her where she needs to go in exchange for free rent.
