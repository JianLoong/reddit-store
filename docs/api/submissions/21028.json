I\u2019m 15 weeks pregnant with our first, and he just had knee surgery yesterday. We live in NYC but he is from the UK. \n\nLast week, my brother in law (32M) decided to visit us for the first time. He\u2019s a failure to launch- never had a real job (unemployed now), lives at home, no gf, games all night and sleeps all day- I could go on. When he arrived, he was the houseguest from hell- no thank yous when we picked him up or took him anywhere, always complaining, leaving clothes and trash spewing in the livingroom and bedroom (including used tissues by the bed which I can only speculate what\u2019s in them), and embarrassed me at my job. He gave my husband a panic attack- because his fear is when his parents are gone his brother will be our problem. Oh, and he said he wants to move to the US and would come back in August to live with us until he figures out what he wants to do (they are US citizens- my father is law is American) Didn\u2019t ask just said it- our only spare room will be the babies room and we have no extra space, in NYC it\u2019s shocking we have as much as we do. \n\nWhen he left, it was early morning and he never said thanks, goodbye, or texted. That was the straw the broke the camels back and I wrote him a text saying I was really disappointed in how he treated us and until he changes his ways it\u2019s best he not stay with us but i do want to build our relationship at a distance for now. I wish my husband had said it but he\u2019s not blunt and neither is his family. \n\nNow my in laws are involved and upset with me. My British husbands culture is to be very passive and they were shocked how direct I was but won\u2019t tell me this, only tell my husband when I\u2019m not in earshot of FaceTime calls. While my husband defended me, it\u2019s left a strain where conversations are just awkward. \n\nNow his parents are saying they want to stay with us for a few weeks to be here before and after the baby is born and I told my husband no. I don\u2019t mind at all if they stay in an Airbnb on our street or at a nearby hotel but we are cramped, about to be a new family of 3, and I just don\u2019t want to play hostess- they are also messy but not as bad as my BIL. \n\nMy husband feels I\u2019m asking them to spend money on lodging for no reason and wants to deal with it with more conversations because his mother is in denial that my BIL needs help, and is dragging his feet in having a conversation with them.

The few weeks after having a child are absolutely crazy and you need people in your corner who are going to not stress you out further. People who want to stay with you should be people you know will actually help with cleaning and cooking and people you don't mind if they see you stressed, sleep deprived, boob hangin' out, and unshowered. If your in laws aren't going to be that for you, then don't let them stay.", "NTA and if your husband won\u2019t do it then you\u2019re going to be in constant turmoil managing his emotions with their aggressiveness. A \u201cfew weeks\u201d, after you\u2019ve had a baby? That\u2019s a no from me.", "NTA. If you don't establish firm boundaries with your in-laws now, they will walk all over you as long as you are married to this guy. It's his job to stand up to them and present a unified front with you. If he can't do that, maybe get him into marriage counseling before things become unbearable.", "NTA.  Establish your boundaries and stick to them like glue.", "NTA, those boundaries will be very important.  Tell them soon about not staying with you.   They will likely be way more work than just the new little one.  Congratulations on the new little one too.", "NTA at all. Dont let him come back. This is a nightmare waiting to happen. You know what he is and it wont get any better. \n\nBut as someone from Britain, passivity is not part of our culture. Look at our history lol", "NTA. \n\nYou're 100% correct that BIL is not your family's problem. He needs to take some responsibility for himself. I can see why he's not welcome. \n\nAs a brand new mum, it's totally understandable that you don't want to host your in-laws. They can stay a shorter time at an Airbnb if they're worried about finances. If you wanted to be super nice, you could contribute a few $ toward that, but it's not a requirement. Your focus is your baby, not your in-laws.", "NTA- you need to set those boundaries now that no visitors are allowed til a few weeks after the baby is born. If you have to , get the hospital nurse to tell him for you as a precaution with a newborn. They advise this anyway to let the newborn and you get settled in and bond time. I hope it works out for you!", "NTA. You are pregnant with your first child, this is a time for you and your husband to get excited about and prepare for the baby. You've already expressed that the only spare room in your home will be the baby's room, so there's already not enough space for your in-laws to stay. You also mention that they are messy, and if they're coming to visit with the intention of helping you with the baby, that is counterintuitive if you have to take care of a baby and your in-laws. Really, while you're pregnant and after you give birth, you should be getting your affairs in order, spending time with your husband, and enjoying any time off you have (I'm guessing you both work because NYC is uber expensive). It's pretty well known that you're going to come up on a lack of sleep, if you're breastfeeding that's a whole new thing, you now have a third family member to care for, this is a huge change in your life and you guys deserve privacy and time as a family without having to take care of other people. Plus, if you're only 15 weeks, you still have a ways ahead of you and you might not be physically comfortable enough to take care of other people; I hope you have a very smooth and easy pregnancy, but morning sickness alone would be reason enough not to want to host people in your house. It would be one thing if they could integrate seamlessly in your life and actually help you, or if you have the space, but your post doesn't sound like that, it sounds like you would really have to be a host rather than relaxing during your pregnancy. It's probably better for your marriage and your baby if you set boundaries now.", "NTA- you need to set those boundaries now that no visitors are allowed til a few weeks after the baby is born. If you have to , get the hospital nurse to tell him for you as a precaution with a newborn. They advise this anyway to let the newborn and you get settled in and bond time. I hope it works out for you!", "NTA. You will be tired, most likely in pain, experiencing trying to nurse perhaps. You will need your husband there for you and your baby and not to entertain and take care of his parents. It sounds like it would be so stressful to have them in your house and ruin your privacy.", "NTA. Hell no. But push them off but be abundantly clear with your husband. Anything can change- you could be put on bed rest, baby can come early or late, etc. You are fighting for your family and your sanity as new parents is going to be already under a great deal of stress. And if you feel this way now, wait until that child is born. Your protective instincts will be next level like you can\u2019t imagine.. It can be a wonderful, bonding experience for all 3 of you, or a chaotic hot mess. Maybe have 1 completely amazing person come for 2 weeks, about 2 weeks after the birth, so you guys can get your feet wet first, as a new family if 3. It\u2019s precious time and soak it in. Infants absorb everything- and I mean everything! And the first 2 months are critical to healthy brain development. That baby will feel your stress a mile away. Don\u2019t do it. \nYou are an American. Your baby will be, too. In NYC. Directness is part of the deal. Not rudeness, but New Yorkers are as real as it gets.", "NTA.  You will be recovering from pushing a whole human or of your body.   That is not the time to be entertaining other folks.  They can stay away until you are able to deal with them.", "NTA.  Visit for a few weeks?  No way. Baby will be up every couple of hours to eat. What if you want to sit in the living room and watch tv  or just sit there in the dark?\nHis parents will be sleeping where???  No, not in the other bedroom,, that is the nursery. \n\nWhat if you want to walk around in underwear and a t shirt because you're going back to bed after feeding baby?\n\nHotel is perfect....and rhey can visit 5 days.", "NTA.

You set a clear boundary and good for you. You certainly don\u2019t need the added stress during your pregnancy of having to entertain people in your home 24/7. Plus, yes the Brit\u2019s are known for sweeping things under the rug and not make waves and some are succinct like a fine honed blade. But decisions have to be made in terms of how THEY decide how to deal with their overgrown inconsiderate, coddled, rude, entitled child. Not you or your partner. I also understand that your husband is trying to keep the peace, as well as you are. But setting a boundary and being blunt are not a bad thing. Sometimes you have to be to get the point across. So no NTA. Relax, take it easy, take care of your growing family. And congratulations on the upcoming arrival of a little human into your lives!", "NTA. So the in-laws either want to turf the BIL problem off on you or escape him by coming to stay with you, possibly indefinitely because FIL is a citizen. Say \u201cTerribly Sorry, but that (whatever) is impossible\u201d, repeat as needed.", "NTA. Tell your husband he can tell them no and be nice, or you will then them no like it is.", "NTA - they will stay and expect you to look after them at the same time you are getting ready to give birth and after you have given birth and are trying to look after your baby.        \nYou will be expected to do everything for them because it\u2019s classed as hospitality.        \nDon\u2019t listen if your husband says he will look after them or they are here to help because neither are true.", "This is making me cry a lil (I\u2019ll blame it on the hormones) it\u2019s been a rough few days and you said in a few sentences what I\u2019ve been trying to articulate. Thank you.", "Totally this. This is the utmost important time for your family (the 3 of you) to learn about each other and make your routines. People visiting who aren\u2019t helpful will slow your progress further and add more stress since when they leave is when you can try to establish that attachment and routine again. Plus you wouldn\u2019t just delivered a baby\u2026. It\u2019s not fair to you to host", "All this. If your husband cannot back you then you'll have IL problems for the rest of your life.\n\nNTA", "That's what I was thinking! Lol", "I know. I didn't get that comment at all.  None of my family are passive about anything.", "This is everything. Yes, we both work crazy hard jobs and my sickness has been pretty awful, while BIL was here I was collapsing in bed by 7pm from aches and exhaustion. BIL also made a comment that him being here would be a help to us, my husband shut that down. \n\nExtra pinch of hurt is I\u2019m the horrid one for saying I didn\u2019t want him to visit but not that he was the horrid one for causing stress. He sent me flowers this week as an apology but I\u2019m not convinced they weren\u2019t from my in laws trying to make me think he\u2019s sorry. I\u2019m at peace never knowing.", "Google the Lemon Clot essay. You read it and then read it again with DH. Tell him that it\u2019s time for him to step up and be your husband and be a father to this new lil one. The three of you are now family and anyone else is extended family. That means the three of you come first and you do what is best for the three of you\u2026not to keep the peace by not upsetting his parents. They sure have a big set inviting themselves to stay in your home at such a vulnerable time.\n\nThis is a hill to die on. I would encourage you to push for couples counseling to help your husband understand how wrong he is, how to stand up for himself, how you can both set boundaries, and most importantly, tell his parents that if/when something happens to them you will not be supporting BIL so he needs to get his shit together and become a productive member of society and provide for himself  because it\u2019s not your job.", "On the plus side, that comment did make me laugh. Wtf lol", "When people show you who they are, believe them the first time. If it sounds out of character for your brother-in-law, who just took advantage of you and made a mess of your house and then alluded to living with you in the near future, suddenly sends you flowers that you're skeptical were from him, go with your gut. They're either from your in-laws who are making it look like he's nicer than he is, or they're from him and he's trying to butter you up so he can get something from you later. People like that don't change, the kind of guy who leaves a cum tissue on someone else's carpet does not turn around and send flowers. Just saying.\n\nYou know what, if you're not going to do it for yourself or your marriage, do it for your baby: do whatever you need to do to have the easiest pregnancy possible. You will have plenty of opportunities to lose sleep after the baby is born, take the wins where you can get them now, because it's only going to get busier from here. Do whatever you can to keep your sanity, even if other people are not happy with it. And your husband needs to support you, you're a family but right now you are the one carrying his child that both of you are responsible for, so he needs to make sure that you are healthy and that your pregnancy is not more difficult than it needs to be, because that could negatively affect the baby. Your job as a mom and his job as a dad are to make sure that your pregnancy runs smoothly. If that means the in-laws don't get to stay during the pregnancy or after the birth, so be it.", "I had forgotten about the lemon clot essay. As I remember it is very interesting. I shall read it again. Im way too old for that to be relevant to me, but I have children who are of an age where pregnancy wouldnt be any surprise.\n\nThanks for the reminder!", "NTA in no way after having a baby do you need to host anyone! If they come they stay else where. That is exactly what hotels and Airb&b were created for.", "NTA.\n\nJust...not the asshole. Tell your husband he has to stand by you and your baby now, and the rest of his family need to deal with that.", "Absolutely 100% NTA!!! Not only is it extremely rude for anyone to just invite themselves to stay in someone else\u2019s home, but to treat you like a parent or caregiver (in your BIL\u2019s case) or do so when you\u2019re expecting your newborn (in your PIL\u2019s case) is completely out of order! \n\nHaving a new baby to care for is ABSOLUTELY a good reason to ask someone to pay for their own accommodations should they choose to visit at that time. So is not having the space to host them in a way that is comfortable for them AND you!", "Exactly. \n\nI would have told BIL to fuck off and don\u2019t come back.", "He came up to our bedroom last night, and I said \u201cso I did a thing\u2026\u201d and showed him. He follows this subreddit and I wanted him to hear it from me. He wanted me to edit and add that they are citizens, which like- still doesn\u2019t change if iata or not IMO. \nTo his family, it\u2019s absurd and unheard of to travel and not stay with relatives. I know for a fact this upsets other relatives who bite their tongue but talk to me privately about their untidiness or how they try to help but make things worse (like tried to vacuum a wet rug on the deck and broke the vacuum but of course didn\u2019t offer to replace it). \n\nI had to go to London for business for 2 weeks a couple of months ago- and my husband said it would be awkward if I didn\u2019t stay with them at least for the weekend, even though my company paid for a 5-star hotel. I just did day visits and I didn\u2019t think it was awkward at all. \n\n\nIt sounds like I\u2019m mad at my husband but I\u2019m not. He\u2019s awesome and We\u2019re aligned in terms of end goal. A few people mentioned we might need counseling and tbh our comms our fine- he just tries to compromise with me because I\u2019m easier to address than his parents. I do think that his family needs counseling though, and they\u2019ve skated by being inconsiderate too long, and it rubs off on my BIL.", "If hubby insists tell him fine you'll stay with your family until they go home. You need support not more work.\nNTA"]}
