Its good that you're sticking up for your son, but it seems like the problem might be closer than you think. Also you're just going off assumptions until he feels comfortable enough to share that part of himself with you- might want to think about why he hasn't yet.\n\n INFO needed:  Does everyone in your family joke about things like that all the time or did your daughter step out of line as well? It's an unfair double standard if its not \"normal for your family\" but she joked anyway and you let that go because she is your daughter while the other one is only a would be in-law. \n\nI know families who do joke about everything where no subject is taboo or \"off the table\" and it really is just all in good fun and everyone jokes about everything but I can't tell from the info given if that's how your family dynamic works.", "NTA... and if your son doesn't have a problem with her homophobia, I wonder how he feels about Kai being gay", "So you assume your son is gay (he's not out yet, so yes, it is an assumption), you assume Nora made a face and a comment about the joke not being funny because she was 'disgusted by the thought of your son being gay', and assume it's becayse of her religion.\n\nAnd based only on these assumptions not only you decided to break your promise to pay for the wedding, but also you just can't wait for her to say 'something that slightly offends' your youngest son so you can justify not attending the wedding. \n\nYTA.", "Soft YTA here.  Though I think it is fair to let your son know that if Nora disrespects Kai you are not going to be paying for the wedding.  That seems like a fair line to draw.\n\nHowever, I'm not sure Nora's comment was out of line.  Your daughter's joke was, especially if Kai is not out to his family.  Making a joke about a person's sexuality when you don't have it confirmed and in a somewhat derogatory fashion is both dangerous and unfunny.\n\nEven if one believes that being gay is \"wrong\" or a \"sin\" - does not mean that one is going to be disrespectful of the person as a person.  Plenty of religious people are able to grasp that it is their religion, not the other person's.  Granted, plenty can't and are incredibly vocal about it.  You state that she has made other comments - maybe those rise to the level of taking this action.  Without the specifics, hard to tell.  But given the situation as described, you daughter was more disrespectful of Kai than Nora was.  Are you still paying for her wedding?", "YTA, but not for your question. This reminds me of another post by a young woman. All of her friends were absolutely convinced she was gay.\n\nWhen she pushed back about their assumptions, they said that she did not act feminine. She pointed out that they were the ones being homophobic if that was their only reason. \n\nApparently, this attitude of yours about homosexuals is so prevalent that it has rubbed off on your daughter. Her jokes about her brother's sexuality are now a not so subtle form of bullying.", "NTA. Sticking up for your son is commendable\n\n(would be pretty funny though if Nora was right and he's not actually gay)", "Nora is TA here.  You should speak with whatever son is engaged to her about your feelings regarding her comments towards Kai. \n\nI'd frame it as you can't support or be involved in any events where one or more people blatantly disrespect any other family members.\n\nIt's his decision in the family v fiancee battle.  If you force the decision, you may end up losing your son to Nora", "NTA. Your daughter needs to chill the fuck out tho, That\u2019s not fresh. And Nora is obviously the asshole.", "YTA\n\nYou're escalating the situation \\*so\\* much without really clear or strong foundations. Going back on a promise to pay for a wedding and effectively telling your son you don't want his chosen partner in your family is a great way to never speak to either of them again after a few years. Is that really what you want? \n\nIf Nora was openly homophobic, directly spewing hate speech at your son, and had tensions with others, sure, I could see being firm. Feel free to correct me, but right now you've only pointed out three pretty poor reasons:\n\n1. She didn't like a frankly lazy sexual joke your 16yo daughter made while ordering food. A lot of people wouldn't appreciate that.\n2. She's religious and \"we know what that means.\" We don't, actually. Religious people aren't a monolith. There are some hateful ones to the LGBTQ+ community, yes, but there are also some who deeply care about and respect the community. \n3. She seems to think he's straight. Ok? He hasn't come out yet, so nothing's really official. Not exactly a bad look to try your best not to assume about someone. Especially as someone not actually in the family yet and probably not as close to Kai, I don't think it's unreasonable for her to either be hesitant pre-out assuming he's gay or just be somewhat unaware.\n\n>As a matter of fact if she ever says something that slightly offends Kai I won't even attend their wedding.\n\nThis line right here is what sank it for me. It seems almost like you're just itching for an excuse to not go. As a parent, you should be trying to connect and compromise with kids, not driving them away. How does Kai feel about all this? It's his opinion that actually matters, not yours.", "NTA. It doesn't matter if any of your kids are gay or not.  Nora is a homophobe and not wanting to pay for the wedding of a homophobe is absolutely reasonable.", "~~YTA Nora might not like that joke because~~ YOUR SON ISNT OFFICIALLY OUT AS GAY! She could feel its in bad taste to \"joke about outing someone\". Until someone officially tells you that they are gay/bi its ok to assume that they are straight. Why? BECAUSE THEY ARNT OUT! Its not cool to force someone out of the closet.\n\nEdit: Ya'll I posted this comment before majority of MAIN INFO was posted by OP in comments. Nora is homophobic and said being gay is a sin. That info was not put in the main post which is terribly IMPORTANT INFO that changes literally everything.", "Nora could have just made that comment because no matter what side of the fence you are on about being gay it\u2019s a tasteless joke. Your family is making a lot of assumptions and Kai is stuck in the middle of it.", "So Kai isn\u2019t out, and may or may not even BE gay. Somehow you\u2019re fine with public family jokes about his sexuality. But you\u2019re NOT fine with Nora being offended by the public shaming.

You say have suspicions, but unless and until he comes out to you, you do not know he is gay.

Not all religious people have a problem with homosexuality. Perhaps she was reacting to the fact that your daughter\u2019s teasing isn\u2019t appropriate.

Sticking up for Kai.", "NTA it sounds like Nora is homophobic and I think you need to make that clear to your son (the one who is marrying Nora) about the reason. However, joking about it when Kai isn\u2019t ready to talk about it isn\u2019t supportive either.\n\nJust a comment, not all religious people are automatically homophobic. Sadly, I know many are but the Anglican Church and other denominations can be more accepting (it obviously varies with each country and congregation). My daughter was baptized by an openly gay Anglican minister who lived with his partner and was widely supported by the church and congregation of the church, many of whom are elderly. Be careful you don\u2019t try to make an assumption of all people who are religious.", "Have you ever talked to Nora about this? Because without speaking to her, you're just making assumptions.

You have the prerogative to pay or not to pay for whatever you'd like. So, strictly for not paying, and learning background about Nora through your comments, it does seem that she was being a homophobe, and you decided you'd had enough. \n\nThe qualification comes from my honest bafflement about how it got to this point. \n\nBUT you say in a comment that Kai is thrilled that you're not paying for the wedding, so I suppose my bewilderment doesn't really matter in the grand scheme of things. Kai feels supported, and an avowed homophobe is facing some consequences. Unfortunately, it seems like she isn't going anywhere.\n\nINFO: You mention that you promised \"years ago\" that you'd pay for their wedding. (Edited)\n\nDid you make this promise to your son before he was with Nora? Or once they were together? \n\nIf you did once he was with Nora ...\n\nWhen did Nora begin displaying her homophobia? Is this a relatively new thing (e.g. in the last 2 months she converted to a very socially conservative religion, or she went down a bad Reddit hole), or has she always held those beliefs and displayed homophobic behavior all along?\n\nIf it's the former, then I can see why you'd react strongly: suddenly she's treating your son badly after accepting him for at least 2 years. \n\nIf it's the latter: what about this specific situation was the catalyst for your reaction? Has no one said anything to her before this? If everyone knows she's homophobic, why has her behavior gone on this long?  How does her fiance/your son feel about how she treats his brother?

That makes both of you AHs. \n\nYour daughter's behaviour isn't normal sibling jokes. It's abusive. You seem to allow your other kids to do the same. How could Kai possibly come out to a family that treats him so badly? He's probably counting the days until he can escape. \n\nNora is treating him badly because of your family's assumptions and behaviour. That makes her an AH.\n\nInstead of focusing on Nora, stop your kids from bullying Kai, with punishment if they make any comments or jokes. You all need to apologise to him and then respect his privacy.", "Nta but honestly you should have a)cracked down on the hotdog joke and and b) already had the convo with Kai about how he can be himself and be open about who he loves, you love him just as he is. Who knows what inner turmoil he is feeling if he insists his boyfriend is just a friend? That would help set the tone for how others treat him too.

We don\u2019t tolerate homophobia here\u2019 etc. it feels like an over reaction to some because one minute no one is acknowledging Kai\u2019s sexuality or openly supporting him, the next you are not paying for a wedding because you are so appalled at negative comments.

Or is she just taking Kai at face value when he says he's straight to respect his boundaries?\n\nEdit based on comments: You're NTA for not wanting to pay for their wedding, as it does seem based on your comments that she actually is homophobic. I will say, I'm not a huge fan of how your family is handling the Kai situation. You should definitely make sure he knows you love him not matter what, but it does seem like he just doesn't want to discuss his sexuality with any of you.

I guess she thought it would be funny to order burgers for everyone but order a hot dog for Kai.

Why are his subjective ideas of what's 'offensive' suddenly her problem?  I mean, you don't have a problem with your own daughter 'joking' that Kai prefers hot dogs because he loves having dicks in his mouth.\n\nSo, to sum up, you're mad at Nora, who you think is homophobic based on a stereotype but don't know for sure, for an ambiguous comment about an actually homophobic joke made by your daughter, which to your mind is fine, about your son, who you assume to be gay based on no real evidence.  Oh, and if the son is, in fact, gay, then your daughter would appear to be, from what you've written, purposefully trying to out him.\n\n\nSounds to me, honestly, like you just don't like Nora, tbh.

In other words, if he were observed for example making out with a guy, you wouldn't be describing him as \"obviously gay\", you'd just cite that evidence that he's potentially feeling same sex attraction. Even then you don't actually know that; people sometimes experiment. If he were openly in a romantic same-sex relationship this might make \"obvious\" more justifiable, but it seems if this is indeed the case he is concealing it.\n\nWith regard to the latter interpretation of \"obvious\", wherein you are inferring his sexuality on the basis of his mannerisms, then I regret to inform you that this would be prejudice. Homosexuals are individuals within a heterogenous group. Like in all men, there is variation within personality characteristics, and this includes those which might be affecting your perception of Kai as homosexual. Common characteristics include \"effeminacy\" and \"sensitivity\". But these characteristics also exist within heterosexuals; there do exist some very effeminate heterosexual men. Sure you could probably demonstrate that the average homosexual man is more effeminate than the average heterobro, but the point is you shouldn't assume a person's sexuality on the basis of their behaviour.\n\nWhy shouldn't you? Well, in doing this you're reinforcing a stereotype. \"Gay men are like this\" becomes \"men like this are gay.\" This  attitude can make it harder for men to come out, either because they are ticking those stereotype boxes and fear the \"we always knew\" reaction, or because they're not \"obvious\" and then fear being scrutinised and reinterpreted through a now distorted lens.\n\nAll this to say:\n\nIf you want your children to feel safe to tell you important information like their sexuality, then you need to show them it's safe. Your daughter's joke was cruel and disrespectful. It communicated \"I know your secret\", which is quite sadistic considering Kai doesn't seem ready to tell you if he is actually gay. Imagine the shame this \"joke\" must have caused your child to feel.\n\nYour son's fiance is a homophobe. You all know it. This would definitely add to the turmoil a closeted gay young man would feel. Who wants to \"cause\" family drama by being the object of the hatred of another family member?\n\nYour son is being bullied by his sister in a house where everyone quite brazenly assumes his sexuality, with a sister-in-law-to-be who openly shows disgust at the mere mention of homosexuality. If I were in your family, I wouldn't feel safe to come out, however \"accepting\" you might be of it.

Kids can be sensitive (which is fair, the world is not a pretty place) and he's already holding back with you (though any shame may not be related to you). I've seen it happen in my own family, even without any jokes. Maybe I'm biased?\n\nAnyhow, regardless of the circumstances, it seems a little cheap to me (also literally, >>> hot dog sausages). Though part of me does wonder whether I'm just being a wet blanket and if it could actually just break the ice somehow? \ud83e\udd14\n\nEdit: I'm just assuming he's gay here.

Did the straight men get served tacos or clams? Gross. Like anyone at the table wants to visualize what your son likes or wants sexually.

It was by choice, because I was embarrassed of my own family, and wouldn't want to expose my crushes to my source of constant embarrassment. \n\nI think yall probably got some unhealthy habits as familial unit that are not 'normal' but have been normalized.

I would sit down with her and your son and lay it out. Something like, \u201cI understand that you have strong feelings about homosexuality, and it\u2019s your right to think what you want. But in our family, homophobia is not acceptable. So if you want to be accepted by our family, you need to understand that negative comments about gay people of any kind will not be tolerated.

They\u2019re not owed it, but I do think it should be clearly stated as to why, along with the above conversation. But one thing I think you may want to discuss with your son before marrying her is what happens if they have a child who is gay? Can he marry someone that he already knows would not accept her own child if they were gay, knowing the harm that does to a child? I think he needs to think about that very seriously.
