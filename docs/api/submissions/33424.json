Its good that you're sticking up for your son, but it seems like the problem might be closer than you think. Also you're just going off assumptions until he feels comfortable enough to share that part of himself with you- might want to think about why he hasn't yet.\n\n INFO needed:  Does everyone in your family joke about things like that all the time or did your daughter step out of line as well? It's an unfair double standard if its not \"normal for your family\" but she joked anyway and you let that go because she is your daughter while the other one is only a would be in-law. \n\nI know families who do joke about everything where no subject is taboo or \"off the table\" and it really is just all in good fun and everyone jokes about everything but I can't tell from the info given if that's how your family dynamic works.", "NTA... and if your son doesn't have a problem with her homophobia, I wonder how he feels about Kai being gay", "So you assume your son is gay (he's not out yet, so yes, it is an assumption), you assume Nora made a face and a comment about the joke not being funny because she was 'disgusted by the thought of your son being gay', and assume it's becayse of her religion.\n\nAnd based only on these assumptions not only you decided to break your promise to pay for the wedding, but also you just can't wait for her to say 'something that slightly offends' your youngest son so you can justify not attending the wedding. \n\nYTA.", "Soft YTA here.  Though I think it is fair to let your son know that if Nora disrespects Kai you are not going to be paying for the wedding.  That seems like a fair line to draw.\n\nHowever, I'm not sure Nora's comment was out of line.  Your daughter's joke was, especially if Kai is not out to his family.  Making a joke about a person's sexuality when you don't have it confirmed and in a somewhat derogatory fashion is both dangerous and unfunny.\n\nEven if one believes that being gay is \"wrong\" or a \"sin\" - does not mean that one is going to be disrespectful of the person as a person.  Plenty of religious people are able to grasp that it is their religion, not the other person's.  Granted, plenty can't and are incredibly vocal about it.  You state that she has made other comments - maybe those rise to the level of taking this action.  Without the specifics, hard to tell.  But given the situation as described, you daughter was more disrespectful of Kai than Nora was.  Are you still paying for her wedding?", "YTA, but not for your question. This reminds me of another post by a young woman. All of her friends were absolutely convinced she was gay.\n\nWhen she pushed back about their assumptions, they said that she did not act feminine. She pointed out that they were the ones being homophobic if that was their only reason. \n\nApparently, this attitude of yours about homosexuals is so prevalent that it has rubbed off on your daughter. Her jokes about her brother's sexuality are now a not so subtle form of bullying.", "NTA. Sticking up for your son is commendable\n\n(would be pretty funny though if Nora was right and he's not actually gay)", "Nora is TA here.  You should speak with whatever son is engaged to her about your feelings regarding her comments towards Kai. \n\nI'd frame it as you can't support or be involved in any events where one or more people blatantly disrespect any other family members.\n\nIt's his decision in the family v fiancee battle.  If you force the decision, you may end up losing your son to Nora", "NTA. Your daughter needs to chill the fuck out tho, That\u2019s not fresh. And Nora is obviously the asshole.", "YTA\n\nYou're escalating the situation \\*so\\* much without really clear or strong foundations. Going back on a promise to pay for a wedding and effectively telling your son you don't want his chosen partner in your family is a great way to never speak to either of them again after a few years. Is that really what you want? \n\nIf Nora was openly homophobic, directly spewing hate speech at your son, and had tensions with others, sure, I could see being firm. Feel free to correct me, but right now you've only pointed out three pretty poor reasons:\n\n1. She didn't like a frankly lazy sexual joke your 16yo daughter made while ordering food. A lot of people wouldn't appreciate that.\n2. She's religious and \"we know what that means.\" We don't, actually. Religious people aren't a monolith. There are some hateful ones to the LGBTQ+ community, yes, but there are also some who deeply care about and respect the community. \n3. She seems to think he's straight. Ok? He hasn't come out yet, so nothing's really official. Not exactly a bad look to try your best not to assume about someone. Especially as someone not actually in the family yet and probably not as close to Kai, I don't think it's unreasonable for her to either be hesitant pre-out assuming he's gay or just be somewhat unaware.\n\n>As a matter of fact if she ever says something that slightly offends Kai I won't even attend their wedding.\n\nThis line right here is what sank it for me. It seems almost like you're just itching for an excuse to not go. As a parent, you should be trying to connect and compromise with kids, not driving them away. How does Kai feel about all this? It's his opinion that actually matters, not yours.", "NTA. It doesn't matter if any of your kids are gay or not.  Nora is a homophobe and not wanting to pay for the wedding of a homophobe is absolutely reasonable.", "YTA Nora might not like that joke because YOUR SON ISNT OFFICIALLY OUT AS GAY! She could feel its in bad taste to \"joke about outing someone\". Until someone officially tells you that they are gay/bi its ok to assume that they are straight. Why? BECAUSE THEY ARNT OUT! Its not cool to force someone out of the closet.", "Nora could have just made that comment because no matter what side of the fence you are on about being gay it\u2019s a tasteless joke. Your family is making a lot of assumptions and Kai is stuck in the middle of it.", "So Kai isn\u2019t out, if he even is gay. Somehow you\u2019re fine with public family jokes about his sexuality. But you\u2019re NOT fine with Nora being offended by the public teasing. In spite of what you\u2019re telling yourself, Nora may not be the actual homophobe here. Take a look in a mirror.

Not all religious people have a problem with homosexuality. Perhaps she was reacting to the fact that your daughter\u2019s teasing isn\u2019t appropriate.

However, joking about it when Kai isn\u2019t ready to talk about it isn\u2019t supportive either.\n\nJust a comment, not all religious people are automatically homophobic. Sadly, I know many are but the Anglican Church and other denominations can be more accepting (it obviously varies with each country and congregation). My daughter was baptized by an openly gay Anglican minister who lived with his partner and was widely supported by the church and congregation of the church, many of whom are elderly.

Is this a relatively new thing (e.g. in the last 2 months she converted to a very socially conservative religion, or she went down a bad Reddit hole), or has she always held those beliefs and displayed homophobic behavior all along?\n\nIf it's the former, then I can see why you'd react strongly: suddenly she's treating your son badly after accepting him for at least 2 years. \n\nIf it's the latter: what about this specific situation was the catalyst for your reaction? Has no one said anything to her before this? If everyone knows she's homophobic, why has her behavior gone on this long?  How does her fiance/your son feel about how she treats his brother?

Who knows what inner turmoil he is feeling if he insists his boyfriend is just a friend? That would help set the tone for how others treat him too. Being open also makes it easier to pull bigots up on their behaviour at the time it happens, eg \u2018excuse me Nora, but kai is perfect just the way he is - who he loves, we love. We don\u2019t tolerate homophobia here\u2019 etc. it feels like an over reaction to some because one minute no one is acknowledging Kai\u2019s sexuality or openly supporting him, the next you are not paying for a wedding because you are so appalled at negative comments.

I will say, I'm not a huge fan of how your family is handling the Kai situation. You should definitely make sure he knows you love him not matter what, but it does seem like he just doesn't want to discuss his sexuality with any of you.

I honestly took this, on initial reading, to absolutely be her defending Kai from that utterly unnecessary homophobic 'joke' from your daughter.\n\n>  She is religious so I don't think I need to explain how she feels about gay people.\n\nThis is just as bigoted and unfair as any homophobia.\n\n> As a matter of fact if she ever says something that slightly offends Kai I won't even attend their wedding.\n\nIs Kai made out of glass?  Why are his subjective ideas of what's 'offensive' suddenly her problem?

Like what's the worst case scenario here??? Kai actually is straight and just super affectionate but you make a stance against someone homophobic becoming part of the family?  Okay then at least you're grandkids will feel safe and accepted when the time comes", "What about this particular moment made you decide not to pay for the wedding? If you've always known she's homophobic, and you've always known she doesn't accept Kai, why did *this exact moment* make your decision? \n\nIf she's been homophobic all this time, you've all known it, and you've said you'll pay for the wedding up to The Hot Dog Incident, why did THAT push you over the edge?\n\nEdited to add: I'm asking all these questions because I'm honestly on the fence about this issue. You stood up for your son against a bigot! ... after years of ignoring/overlooking her behavior. She's always been that person, apparently, and chances are good she'll continue to be that person. Not paying for their wedding isn't going to change that, and her fiance seems committed to her, regardless of her treatment of his brother.", "I think YTA if you paid for your older kids wedding and promised to pay for this son\u2019s wedding, and are now refusing, especially based on this comment. His sister teased him and she said not to tease him and you\u2019re now refusing to pay for the wedding???? Over reaction.", "INFO: have you made it clear enough that she knows?\n\nNot about the wedding part (like a dangling carrot, but I'm with you), but did she know that you're not only silent on the issue but will one to act? (kudos, btw)\n\nJust pointing out that what's missing from your post is what and how was communicated, even from Nora, hence everyone is unsure who-saw-what", "You realise a lot of your comments are pretty homophobic?? \u201cIt\u2019s pretty obvious\u201d, \u201cwe know the truth\u201d. You\u2019re also extremely prejudiced about people who celebrate religion \u201cShe\u2019s also religious so I don\u2019t think I need to explain how she feels about gay people.\u201d Whilst pretending you are open minded you are in fact bigoted against anyone\u2019s else\u2019s opinion if it doesn\u2019t align with your own.", "Don\u2019t give your word originally if you want to add conditions later. He\u2019s still breaking his word.", "just jumping in that I also found this joke to be very cringy, not out of homophobia, it\u2019s just not very funny and sort of crass.", "You might want to put this in an update so that those that are saying you're the asshole think that this is her first time commenting on this. Since this is not the first I still think NTA.", "Ask her how old she was when she decided she was heterosexual? I would do the same thing you\u2019re doing. Homophobia, racism, anything along those lines should not just tacitly be accepted. NTA", "Then, fair enough. If she's been openly homophobic, then that's the issue. \n\nHow does her fiance/your other son feel about how she treats his brother?", "You didn't actually give any examples.", "The \u201cjoke\u201d was horrible regardless of Nora. Your daughter is not handling this well. AT ALL.\n\nYou\u2019re nta for not wanting to pay. I will say, though, that you should have this conversation with your son (Nora\u2019s fiancee), asap.\n\nAlso teach your daughter some maturity and appropriate behaviour. \n\nN T A if you can see these things are necessary. Your daughter can learn. Pretty sure Nora is a homophobic AH. And I wonder why your son puts up with it and won\u2019t support his brother?", "OP you're NTA and a good parent for standing up for your son, and I would definitely add an edit about catching Kai and his \"friend\" kissing so all these naysayers will stop with this bs. :)", "You're not. That person is being obtuse. When my brother came out to me I told him, \"I know. It's obvious.\" Because it was obvious.", "Its obvious is super condescending and not really needed. You can have your suspicions but it doesn\u2019t really need to be said. \n\nAlso the fact that you let your daughter openly mock him, no wonder he doesn\u2019t feel safe to come out. She\u2019s 17 not a baby, and knows what she is doing is cruel.", "he hasn't come out to you. or anyone in your fam", "Eh, I wouldn't pay  be for the wedding of a bigot either, and I would be sorely disappointed in a child marrying someone that religious.", "I didn't say that op has to out Kai to decline payment. I meant that they should be mindful of that and not say it is because of Kai. It is perfectly acceptable to say \" I don't like homophobes\" and leave it at that.", "And you know they aren\u2019t dating because???", "His sister is being a homophobe too. But I bet he\u2019ll still pay for her wedding one day.", "It is possible to laugh something off even if you dislike the joke. Why? To not create a scene. To not seem weak. To not seem overly emotional.", "It definitely seems like bullying.", "It\u2019s bullying. If you can\u2019t see that making jokes implying homosexuality towards someone who hasn\u2019t come out is bullying, then you\u2019re part of the bullying problem.", "What a riveting and thoughtful response! Did it take you a while to think of it?", "Easy then, NTA. You did it to protect and honor your son. Him being officially out or not out or whatever doesn\u2019t matter. The goal of your action was attained, and the channel you took made sense. Why support someone who doesn\u2019t support your family? You wouldn\u2019t, so that\u2019s what you did. \n\nA1 Father! Hope your other kids end up with loving and caring spouses your family deserves it!", "It is the default, though. Maybe look up the actual meaning of the word.", "So can you explain to me why you need \"to be out\"? I am straight and I never needed to be out, so why gay people do? Can't they just love who they love without the need to announce it?\nAnd just to add: one of my closest friends is gay. He never actually \"came out\". We just knew and nobody really questioned anything when he started dating boys ( we were around 14 at the time).", "Ah, so your gay perspective must speak for all gay people?  LOL", "If he had a boyfriend would be insist they were \u201cjust a friend\u201d to his parents though? Or would he just introduce them as his boyfriend?", "no we can\u2019t that would be gay", "It\u2019s her money and she doesn\u2019t have to pay.  \n\nWhy should she pay for a wedding for someone who literally hates her other son? Will Nora say Kai can\u2019t be in the wedding? What will Nora say when Kai gets married? Will she refuse to go? \n\nOP is ensuring her son Kai isn\u2019t relegated to second class citizen status by Nora.", "Sounds like the reply of someone who hasn\u2019t encounter homophobia. You\u2019re being a great mom OP!!", "You\u2019re saying he\u2019s homophobic because he knows his son is gay??  That is fucking retarted lmao how do you even survive the day without help?", "It doesn\u2019t make you a \u201cbigot\u201d to stand against homophobia. What a dumb comment.", "Won\u2019t someone think of the homophobia fianc\u00e9\u2019s feelings?!?! \ud83d\ude31", "Telling someone it\u2019s obvious might be condescending but people can think literally whatever they want. He never verbalized anything and never did anything wrong.", "Just because someone hasn't come out doesn't mean you can't see the writing on the wall. Kids tend to think they are a \\*lot\\* more subtle than they actually are lol", "And he probably never will. I don't think he will wake up one day and announce \"I'm gay\" \n\nI can already imagine him marrying his boyfriend when he still hasn't said the \"magic words\"", "Again, I'm not convinced she's a bigot based on the information we have. There's just so little. And frankly, it seems a little bigoted of you to be blindly against your child marrying someone just because of their religious beliefs. I don't know your full story or context, and don't feel like arguing that rn, but just pointing out how that looks.  \n\nYou're free to do, pay for, and accept whatever you want. But if your child has chosen a partner they want to commit with for the rest of their life, you have to accept as a parent that refusing to accept them is going to lead to losing contact with your kid. Maybe you're ok with that consequence, but you can't ignore it.", "Kai literally said so to OP. It\u2019s rude to keep assuming so after someone says they aren\u2019t, no matter the genders.", "Ok let's ignore what actually happened and go on with the fake version of events that you came up with.\n\nYou probably know better than me it's not like I was there /s", "Ok let me explain to you what is \"not\" bullying.\n\nIf two people are joking and they are both laughing and enjoying their time, then it's not bullying.\n\nI have 5 kids and none of them are as close as Kai and my daughter are. He adores his \"baby sis\" as he calls her", "I think you should edit and add this to your post. That Kai is happy you stood up for him.", "Hi, I\u2019m a pansexual trans-non-binary person. I\u2019m generally perceived as a masc-leaning cis lesbian. \n\nBeing \u201cout\u201d isn\u2019t about making announcements. It\u2019s about not hiding who you are. It\u2019s a man introducing husband at a work event. It\u2019s a woman mentioning her girlfriend in casual conversation. It\u2019s a trans man mentioning his trip to the gynecologist to a close friend. It\u2019s living authentically. I never made an announcement about being gay/queer, but I don\u2019t hide it. That\u2019s what being \u201cout\u201d means.\n\nEdit: typo.", "No I was just giving my perspective thats all", "And he might not be \u201ctotally\u201d gay as there\u2019s a wide spectrum between gay and straight. Perhaps he\u2019s still figuring out where he is on this spectrum and you\u2019re trying to pin him into a box he\u2019s not comfortable with. \n\nLabels suck. Just let him know you\u2019ll love him no matter what as long as he\u2019s comfortable in his own skin.", "Did you ever think the way you tease him by buying a hit dog because he likes dick is why he doesn\u2019t come out?  Did you buy hotdogs for your DILs?   Did you buy clams for your sons?  No, just your gay son?   Do you see a problem there?   You sexualize your supposedly gay son in front of his family and NO ONE wants that!!!!", "It would be odd for him to marry that guy without acknowledging that they were dating, though, and right now, you've said he won't do that.\n\nI haven't officially come out to certain people as in 'sit down I have to tell you I'm bi,' but I've mentioned that I have a girlfriend. If your son is actually in a relationship with a guy, but won't introduce it as a romantic relationship, that's very different than him just not talking about his orientation one way or another, but telling you about a specific relationship.", "And he should not have to \"come out.\" You know who he is, he may never want to announce it, and commenters are jumping on your post without thinking of what you are saying here. You have your hackles up over your future daughter-in-law for a reason\u2014she has shown her disdain, there is no mistaking it\u2014and you are definitely NTA.", "This is the case with my sister. She never felt it necessary to announce that she was gay. She has just lived her life with her same sex partner and everyone knows.", "Maybe he doesn\u2019t feel comfortable since it doesn\u2019t sound like anyone called her out on it. When no one called her out on it he may not know where anyone stand, or if people would defend him against her comments once he\u2019s out.", "Yep, and I also tell my mom that I\u2019m not dating the girls I bring home for the holidays. Doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m not a lesbian? You seem confused here..\n\nWhether they\u2019re dating, screwing, or testing the waters. They are,* say it with me*, gay!", "Oh damn, I didn't realize you are a mind reader!", ">right now, you've said he won't do that.\n\nMaybe this is the opposite of the common assumption and Kai is SO comfortable he doesn't even have to think about NEEDING to \"come out\". My straight friends don't go around \"coming out\" to their parents, they just bring their bf/gf home to meet them. I'll be glad when it's the same expectation for us too.", "Right? Why are people acting like there\u2019s a set way to be gay. Like, you have to make an announcement? Why can\u2019t they just do them and if they don\u2019t want to make an announcement they don\u2019t? If they do then they do?", "To my reading, OP said he wasn\u2019t going to pay for their wedding anymore, & that he wouldn\u2019t even attend their wedding if she kept making homophobic comments, or said anything that even slightly offended his son. To me, that very much counts as calling it out & defending his son.", "The only person confused here is you. People don\u2019t tell the truth about relationships for a lot of reasons (you in your example). All the info someone not in that relationship has is what they\u2019re told, because friendships and romantic relationships can look similar from the outside. \n\nIf some says they\u2019re friends with someone, not dating, it\u2019s wrong to assume they\u2019re lying about that. I\u2019d think a fellow lesbian would understand that.", "And I didn't realize people here are clairvoyant. We were both wrong I guess", "But when they bring their gf or bf round they don\u2019t insist they are \u201cjust a friend\u201d. I think that\u2019s the key difference.\n\nSaying it\u2019s obvious this is his boyfriend when he\u2019s insisting that is person is just a friend is not the same as him not needing to come out. If he was so comfortable he didn\u2019t need to come out why wouldn\u2019t he say this person is his bf?", "People are offering a potential alternate reasoning for behavior. They're not saying that is what's happening, just that it MIGHT be. You're stating without a shadow of a doubt that you KNOW what's going on in other people's heads."]}
