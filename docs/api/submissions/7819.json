It was probably hard for your brother to hear that, and face his own disappointment towards your dad because he had a different experience.

If he truly wants to be a better person he would own his mistakes, not pretend they didn\u2019t happen.", "NTA you told him what happened because he asked. I don\u2019t know why people think we have to keep family members bad behaviour a secret.", "NTA, this matter was bound to arise sooner or later, your brother probably asked everyone in the family already and they refused to answer, leaving you as the bearer of the bad news that his dad is not perfect...", "NTA \n\nYou've been honest with your brother and it's normal that he and your father had an argument over it. \n\nI wouldn't worry about their relationship either because they'll make up after your brother sees that your father knows he fked up and is actually sorry.\n\nI hope sooner or later you'll feel better enough to have a relationship with your father too.", "Absolutely positively NTA. Your brother ask and you answered honestly. What happens from there is not your responsibility and whatever shit your brother gave you dad about it, your dad deserved! It not even your Uncle\u2019s place be in the middle of! I\u2019m glad to see you and your brother seem to have a decent/good relationship. Childhood trauma is hard to leave behind, especially without any time of professional therapy.

He chose to act the way he did even though you told him that it was in the past and he should treat it like that, you told him it is between you and your dad, but he chose to involve himself, which is his right. You shouldnt blame yourself for someone else's actions, whether those actions are the actions of your dad, your mom or your brother.", "NTA, He asked and you just told him the truth.", "NTA.\n\nThe truth was going to come out eventually. The way I see it, this was inevitable. Your dad emotionally abused you and now he has to live the rest of his life knowing he ruined the relationship with his son, his ex-wife, and probably his youngest son", "Your brother (16?) asked and you were honest with him - that your father may be a great dad to him, but he never was to you. What your brother does with that information is up to him. **NTA**", "NTA If Dad was truly sorry and changed, he would own his past evils, not make it YOUR responsibility to protect him.", "NTA. Truth hurt. Your father is trying to be better but the past cannot be cancelled. You didn't put your brother against him. Your brother listened to both sides and made a decision.", "Sorry things sucked for you. Sometimes parents fuck up big time. There's no book. One thing I've noticed is that we're in these family cycles that just repeat if we don't do anything about it. I hope you don't find yourself in your dad's position some day.", "NTA. All you did was tell your brother the truth about your dad. You didn't ask him to do anything about it, that's a decision he made on his own. And he's allowed to know anyway.", "How much you want to bet the father told the younger brother a sanitized version of the truth? There's no way a 'great' father would admit how shitty he was before so how would he explain his oldest son being estranged? \n\nNTA because I highly doubt your father was truthful about why you and him aren't talking and I bet that's what your brother has issues with. Not that you told him the truth but that you told him a different story than what your guys father told him.", "NTA\n\n\nYou told the truth.
