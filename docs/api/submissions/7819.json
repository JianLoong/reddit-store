I\u2019ve had similar talks with my half sisters when they were around that age (im 14 & 18yrs older than them). It boiled down to, we may have had the same father physically but that man is two very different dads to his children. \n\nI held off that convo for a long while & even made the first round very soft bc I wanted them to come to their own conclusions. As we\u2019ve gotten older (eldest is in her 30s now) more truths, from both sides, have come to light. He lied to them about me their entire lives. And come to find out, he is just a different kind of asshole to my sisters; still an ass though! And unfortunately has them so trauma trained from his narcissism/ toxicity they still do everything they can to not rock the boat; including hiding their relationship w me from him. \n\nDid the same w my cousins. I\u2019m a decade+ older than my cousins & I kept the knowledge of my mother\u2019s altruistic narcissism & her parents\u2019 litany of toxicities to myself & just backed away from the fam bc the cousins were too young for this to be put on them (im forever a protector too). Now, they\u2019re all in their 30s & due to way too much death we have become a LOT closer. Mother didn\u2019t like this and disparaged me to my cousins any chance she got, including outright lies. So I went nuclear-lite & called her out in the family group chat. \n\nBoth of my life givers now refuse to acknowledge my existence. Come to find out, toxic humans don\u2019t like when their victims call them out. Who knew!\n\nOP, do not take on the GUILT your abuser is trying to put on you for speaking your truth & lived experiences. The guilt is part of their toxicity & what toxic humans use to manipulate & control. Dear ol dad *might* be feeling bad about how he treated you but the overwhelming big sad he\u2019s feeling is that the child he cultivated to not know the full breadth of who he really is, now does. \n\nYou very well may have unlocked some insight for your brother. Daddy dearest may not be the shining father you think he\u2019s been to your brother & brother may be putting pieces together about his own childhood that happened behind closed doors & now has the validation to understand things & see things more accurately. Or maybe he\u2019s just disgusted w his dad bc he treated you so terribly & that\u2019s valid as well. \n\nContinue to be there for your bro & be sure he knows you are a safe & non-judgmental, non-guilt-ridden space that he can turn to. My sisters continue to reveal more things to me as the years & decades wear on bc they know I unconditionally love them & would never judge them or use their words & feelings against them. \n\nYou did good OP; your male life giver is the problem here, not you. You\u2019re NTA.", "Uncle is a bit of a shit-stirrer", "That\u2019s assuming the father really did feel shame instead of just looking away from the \u201cdisappointment\u201d. I can\u2019t imagine that the father even really wants to make amends with OP. \n\nOP is NTA in every possible way", "Exactly! Now is the time for the dad to step up and explain that he was wrong in what he did, and he tried hard to learn from his mistakes so he didn\u2019t repeat them with the younger brother. People can be dumb and stubborn and not see what they\u2019re doing until it\u2019s too late, and while it doesn\u2019t excuse any of his past shameful actions, he is trying to be a better person. That he doesn\u2019t expect forgiveness because no matter how sorry you are, sometimes sorry comes too late, but he hopes that he can do better now and continue to do better in the future. That\u2019s how he steps up and owns what he did. I hope he does that.\n\nEdit to say: NTA It\u2019s so hard to come to terms with how your parent is human and makes mistakes. And some parents make HUGE mistakes. I feel for these brothers. It\u2019s heartbreaking what the older brother went through. Explaining the past isn\u2019t wrong, especially because he said that his relationship doesn\u2019t effect the younger brother\u2019s\u2026 he explained it all with respect to his brother\u2019s feelings and experiences.

Disagree.", "That method of thinking makes me shake with fury. It's like people saying that the life of the person who did harm shouldn't be ruined over a \"mistake\", it takes zero account for how the victim will forever carry that trauma. That even after decades of therapy, it can still peek out and fuck things up.", "Same, my dad gave up drinking and drugs when my sister was born. I feel like the practice baby.", "IMO, if OP\u2019s father was feeling bad, there wouldn\u2019t have been a fight with his other son. \n\nBut you\u2019re probably spot on. His father probably just found a different, more subtle way to be abusive to his second son.", "Yeah Uncle is a jerk here.", "Well, that's the only motive for telling someone to keep a wrong done to them a secret: protect the reputation of the offender. If Dad doesn't feel that way, then Uncle's the one who wants that done, which is none of his business.", "But then you're saying that no one is allowed to grow and to change. The Father was an AH totally, but he learned from his mistake and has grown and gotten better. He deserves some credit for that. Not forgiveness maybe, but credit for accepting his faults and actively working to change.", "I don't see anyone telling OP to keep secret about his and his father's relationship in his post."]}
