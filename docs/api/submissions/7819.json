It boiled down to, we may have had the same father physically but that man is two very different dads to his children. \n\nI held off that convo for a long while & even made the first round very soft bc I wanted them to come to their own conclusions. As we\u2019ve gotten older (eldest is in her 30s now) more truths, from both sides, have come to light. He lied to them about me their entire lives. And come to find out, he is just a different kind of asshole to my sisters; still an ass though! And unfortunately has them so trauma trained from his narcissism/ toxicity they still do everything they can to not rock the boat; including hiding their relationship w me from him. \n\nDid the same w my cousins. I\u2019m a decade+ older than my cousins & I kept the knowledge of my mother\u2019s altruistic narcissism & her parents\u2019 litany of toxicities to myself & just backed away from the fam bc the cousins were too young for this to be put on them (im forever a protector too). Now, they\u2019re all in their 30s & due to way too much death we have become a LOT closer. Mother didn\u2019t like this and disparaged me to my cousins any chance she got, including outright lies.

Daddy dearest may not be the shining father you think he\u2019s been to your brother & brother may be putting pieces together about his own childhood that happened behind closed doors & now has the validation to understand things & see things more accurately. Or maybe he\u2019s just disgusted w his dad bc he treated you so terribly & that\u2019s valid as well. \n\nContinue to be there for your bro & be sure he knows you are a safe & non-judgmental, non-guilt-ridden space that he can turn to. My sisters continue to reveal more things to me as the years & decades wear on bc they know I unconditionally love them & would never judge them or use their words & feelings against them. \n\nYou did good OP; your male life giver is the problem here, not you.

Now is the time for the dad to step up and explain that he was wrong in what he did, and he tried hard to learn from his mistakes so he didn\u2019t repeat them with the younger brother.

That he doesn\u2019t expect forgiveness because no matter how sorry you are, sometimes sorry comes too late, but he hopes that he can do better now and continue to do better in the future. That\u2019s how he steps up and owns what he did. I hope he does that.\n\nEdit to say: NTA It\u2019s so hard to come to terms with how your parent is human and makes mistakes. And some parents make HUGE mistakes. I feel for these brothers. It\u2019s heartbreaking what the older brother went through.

I guess your brother is a teenager now, he probably has his own problems with your father, regardless of what you've told him about the past. But I know for a fact, it does not automatically means their relationship is broken or broken beyond repair. Figuring out that our parents are human, that they make mistakes, and how imperfect they can be is a part of growing up. If your father was actually a good father to your brother, they have a good chance to keep having at least a decent relationship.\n\nWhat is a little worrying here is not your part in this whole thing, but the reason why they fought.

I am ashamed and don't know how to make amends.  I am very sorry for my actions.\n\nBut no, he didn't.  He cried to his brother and now your uncle is blaming you for telling your brother of your experience.  None of this is your fault.", "Oh OP, reading your post really brought back memories to my younger self. When you're a child and you have parents who are constantly telling you how much of a failure you are - I wouldn't be surprised if he even made you feel suicidal at times. Your trauma is real and if you think it's the best for your mental health to cut off your dad forever that if absolutely your choice and you need to do the best for you. I grew up with a very tiger-like mom who was always comparing me with her friend's daughters and criticizing my grades when they weren't up to par. At the time hearing it hurt so much that I even thought that I should just die because she then she would just be happier because it seemed like I was never enough. Your dad never made you feel like you were worth anything when you were growing up and that shit sticks. I'm fortunate enough that eventually my mother stopped treating me like this when I got older and listened when I told her how I felt when I was younger.\n\nI would like to say that I think, looking at how your dad is treating your brother that he has learned from his past mistakes because he never wants your brother to go through what you had to go through. I don't know exactly how or what your brother and father fought about - was your father defensive and insistent that he never treated you wrongly and that you were just telling lies? If so run far far away because you 100% do not need someone like that in your life and there are absolutely parents out there that will never admit they hurt their children because of their own justifications. Or was it your brother getting mad at your father because of how he treated you in the past and perhaps your father was shocked and wished you spoke to him? I don't know - I want to believe your father grew and has the capacity to see his mistakes and can own up to how he hurt you but I am not him and you are not under any obligation to talk to someone who hurt you.\n\nNTA.", "NTA. All upu did was tell the truth.", "NTA and as much as it sucks for you it looks like he learned from his mistakes and did better with your brother. Your past is your past no reason to hide it.

This brought back a lot of flashbacks for similar things I won't go into here. But reading about your grades gave me chills as it reminded me of a guy at my high school who was rather quiet, kept to himself. One day some of the students who were musicians began playing after some kind of assembly ended. They were playing The Fifth Dimension song *Aquarius/Let The Sun Shine In* when this quiet kid began singing the *Let The Sun Shine In* with all his heart and soul in it! No one knew he sang and here he is with a voice blessed by angels and a delivery like Otis Redding! People were raving about his singing and hoped it would happen again. A few weeks later, on report card day, we learned that rather than face his father with a less than perfect report card, he hung himself in the back yard before his dad got home.\n\nSo many of us, including me, could have gone that way. So you told the truth. After he asked.\n\nGlad you have your family, and if your mother is still living I hope she's well and like most of us here I'm glad she stood up for you.\n\nBest wishes in all that you do, you deserve to enjoy life.", "NTA.\n\nI had to have a version of this talk with my half-sister. She was working through the disturbing realization that the wonderful parents she had (my mother and stepfather) were the terrible parents to 3 other kids (me and my two stepsiblings). Terrible to the point that all three of us have gone no-contact.\n\nI am glad she had a great childhood. But the difference hurts.", "You did the right thing here. You didn't seek him out to tell him, you didn't initiate the conversation, he asked a question, you gave a truthful answer. Not your fault. The fault lies with your dad and if he was a decent human being, he'd have approached you before the funeral and apologized. Would it have made a difference? Only you can decide that.", "NTA.  Your brother asked you why you didn't speak to your father and you told him.  You didn't make a scene at the funeral and you didn't hang a billboard about it.  You were asked a question and you answered.  Your uncle needs to understand that just because you were raised in the same house doesn't mean you had the same experiences with each parent.  While my brother and I lived in the same house and had some similar bad experiences  with our mother, our overall relationship with our mother was very different .  He was older and was out of the house earlier, while I was much younger and bore the brunt of our mother's attention.  Our adult relationship with our mother was very different consequently.  That can be hard to see from the outside.  I don't think you did anything wrong.", "NTA. In general - if you don't want people knowing about the horrible things you've done - don't do horrible things. By that I mean, he has to own up to his own actions and choices. He's a grown man. Also, from what you wrote it doesn't sound as though you trash-talked your father to your brother, and you didn't just start shouting from the rooftops unsolicited - your brother asked you point-blank. It sounds to me as though all you did was tell him your side of the story. If your father has something to add, he can (and maybe/probably has), and if he - not your uncle - has a problem with you answering honestly when your own brother asks you a question, he can work on his own communication skills and come talk to you himself.", "NTA. Your brother has a right to know, and he asked for the truth.", "I\u2019m anticipating this conversation coming with my little half brother. He\u2019s 17 years younger than me.

It's not on you about what consequences your father got from him STILL not being remorseful of his past and current wrongs. Just because you had to go NC doesn't mean every day that your father does nothing to rectify his failure as a father with you, adds more hurt to the situation.

Nothing was I did was ever good enough.", "NTA\n\nHe asked a question and you were honest with him. You also made it clear to him that the dynamics of him and your dad are different. It\u2019s hurtful that your dad was that way to you, but you have the nuanced appreciation that your brother didn\u2019t go through that because your dad learned his lesson and did better. That doesn\u2019t mean you will talk to him but it\u2019s ok for your brother to continue to talk to him. Your brother made a decision to confront his dad. He didn\u2019t have to. But whatever reason he did, is not on you. There\u2019s a chance his dad lied about why you two were distant. There\u2019s a chance he feels robbed of the chance to have an older brother in his younger years. There\u2019s many reasons why your brother confronted him and none of them have to do with you nor is it your responsibility. Your brother could\u2019ve kept a private conversation to himself and he chose not to. I will say your uncle is messy. He should\u2019ve called your dad not you. Your dad is grown. He needs to learn how to properly talk to his children.", "NTA if they were asking you to talk to him, they should have expected that question to come up. If they were going to have a problem with how you might answer it, they should have dealt with that before asking you to talk with him so everyone could decide if thats what they actually wanted to happen.", "NTA. Your brother asked and you answered. If your answer lead to a fight, it\u2019s likely because your father had lied and told him something vastly different or nothing at all.

You aren't required to keep that a secret just and your brother has his own relationship with your dad.", "NTA. But I think we are missing some details. \n\nDad didn't talk to you at the funeral.

If your dad has been a good dad to your brother, they can get past a fight, even if it's about something serious. And if they can't, that's not your fault. He asked and you were honest. You didn't set out to cause a problem or tell him he should be angry at your dad.", "So dad was mean got it", "NTA\n\nAll you did was tell the truth, if your father was truly remorseful he would at the very least apologize.\nHe hasn't, he got a do over with your stepbrother and swept his past under the rug instead of doing something about it.", "NTA.  You don\u2019t know what kind of Dad he was to your brother after you cut contact. Maybe the conversation prompted your brother to examine some things.

NTA.", "Definitely NTA", "NTA, I'm going through a very similar situation with my younger sister and my dad. Personally, I think it's your right to tell your story to your brother when you felt comfortable enough to do so. He was gonna find out eventually.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nAs siblings, you have the absolute right to share what happened to you. Now he just knows the truth.", "NTA.  My heart goes out to you OP.  I was never openly called a disappointment like you were, but to my parents an A was expected, a B was worthy of genuine concern, and a C was seen as how most people consider an F.   So many times I was made to *feel* worthless.  And then my parents wonder why I\u2019m so hard on myself in everything else I do. \n\nPlus I knew people who really did have it as bad as you.  This kid in my class once  I remember had a meltdown because he got a 98/100 on a test and didn\u2019t want to \u201cface\u201d his parents with it.  It was heartbreaking and kind of scary. \n\nIt\u2019s not like you went to your brother and volunteered your past with the intention to cause a rift between him and your dad.  *He* asked *you,* probably because no one else would tell him, and you even said he shouldn\u2019t let the past taint his relationship with your dad now because your dad improved. \n\nWhile I\u2019m really glad your dad didn\u2019t repeat the cycle with your brother, that doesn\u2019t erase what he did to you. It doesn\u2019t erase that he should have never abused you in the first place.  His past and his mistakes are his own to deal with.  Plus, you are not in control of or responsible for how your brother takes and uses the information.  And he probably would have kept digging anyway until he found out the truth, one way or another.  \n\nDon\u2019t be so hard on yourself.

If they didn't fight because of this, there would probably have been any other reason later.  \n\n\nOn another side, and this is a personal opinion, I wouldn't recommend to hold resentment for so long. I understand your father hurt you, but from what you say, he's grown and as you've cut contact, you've never really given him the chance to rebuild the relationship. Sometimes parents try and fail, that doesn't mean they don't love us; they are doing their best.  \n\n\nOf course, what you've told us is just a snippet of your story and there may as well be much more info that we ignore that support your decision to go NC.

Not that as survivors we don\u2019t often suffer a lifetime from the things we experienced but because I believe deeply in restorative justice, compassion and that people can and do change. All of which is possible if the person who has been abusive is willing to truly make amends- to listen to the consequences of their actions from the folks who survived their behavior and attempt to rectify where they can. Im not saying any of that is easy, or common, but perpetual punishment and rage both don\u2019t work and are ultimately not great solutions for survivors.", "When I was 18 I reported a relative of my dad's for assaults that spanned several years as a child.

It\u2019s been a useful thing to lean on when I\u2019m struggling. Fact is my dad was someone who routinely bullied and abused children- he blames the violence he experienced as a kid for that behavior now but the truth is he was an adult who made the choice not to get any help and just go on abusing his kids until my mom left him.

He has no obligation to remain in contact or to provide forgiveness, but it's absolutely ridiculous that you have this self-aggrandizing punitive masturbation that no one can change, even when the victim themselves is acknowledging a positive change in behavior.\n\nAs someone who has also experienced their own traumas. What you're doing isn't pro-victim, it's just anti-rehabilitation.\n\nYour comments are uninformed, unexpected and unnecessary.", "Actually the father did admit he was wrong and asked for forgiveness. The son refused, which is his right. The father is ashamed of the way he treated OP and hasn't kept doing it with the son he had later. That was right there in the post.\n\nDuring counseling that I have had I was encouraged to talk it out with my emotional abuser. The idea being that you'll never be able to get past it and grow if you only focus on what was done to you. \n\nI'm sure if it had been physical violence the counselor's advice would not have been the same.", "You don't, you can't nor should you go into it with that mindset. Reconciliation helps both the victim, offender and society at large. The idea is to heal the wounds and create a healthier framework for future engagement, if you're looking to restore what can never be returned, you're cornering yourself into a position of perpetual resentment.\n\nI never said it works for every problem, I just said that it's generally a healthier approach. It works primarily when the person who did harm (like OP's father) wants to heal the trauma caused.", "That is your experience.  Doesn\u2019t mean it works or should apply to all.\n\nI\u2019m in therapy and not once has my therapist recommended that I talk it out with my abuser, who was entirely emotionally and mentally abusive.\n\nI\u2019m past it, as in that I have healed my own trauma within myself and with my loved ones around me as support.  But that doesn\u2019t mean I need to forgive or acknowledge my actual abuser to continue forward."]}
