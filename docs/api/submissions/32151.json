It would make more sense to leave him in place, taking care of the house, then upend everything. She could go into the house and two months later decide to go somewhere else, leaving you to find someone to fill the hole in the home again. I doubt your friend would go back out of fear of being kicked out again if she changes her mind. \n\nI'm also being selfish here. Don't know how old the kid is, but the addition of a kid and dog would probably mean damage to your things that you left, or at least having to move it to storage to make room for the two. \n\nI feel your offer of assisting with rent is more than fair, your friend deserves to stay in the house, and your SIL needs to find something else out.", "NTA.

Meaning, you couldn't evict you friend until February as we are into December. I assume SIL needs a place to stay before then.\n\nAlso... As the home was YOUR inheritence, you want to keep any rental income and repairs away from your marital assets, or you are giving away half your inheritance to your wife in the event of a divorce.\n\nThe house should have NOTHING to do with your marriage.

SIL already has a workable plan that allows her the family support she currently needs. Not to mention that once she moves herself, child and pet into a home she can\u2019t afford as a single mother, she\u2019s never going to leave.

Besides it would would just be wrong to kick him out.", "It's not like she is homeless she was going to her parents, who can help with her son. I get your Sister wants to be the hero in the story. But your SIL may be best with her parents and if she reconciles with the husband and moves back. Now you have kicked your friend out and the house is empty.  Too many variables here that don't make sense to kick him out while he is paying rent and taking care of the home for you. And agrees to your conditions on visiting. \n\nTo keep the peace, I would say give it six months if she is still at the parents house. You can revisit the conversation.", "NTA. Your friend was there first and is a great tenant. SIL can move with her parents, you dont owe her anything. It would be different if the house wasnt occupied. Keep communication open with your friend, as it seems your wife would not be above trying to manipulate him to leave to get her way.", "NTA, if you ran the rental as a business would you feel right kicking tenants out every time someone in the family could use it?", "NTA. \n\nAlso, kicking him out by January could be illegal where you live without a hefty payout. Where I am, you need to give a minimum of 3 months notice and last month free rent to evict for family/landlord to move back into the place.

It took me a couple times before I permanently left my EX.  Happens.  Probably be good for SIL to stay with parents since they can help with childcare and getting her safely on her feet.\n\nFamily rentals tend me to nightmares here on Reddit so you won't get much push back from anyone who's been around awhile.", "NTA\n\n1.) it is your house\n\n2.) your friend has proven to be trustworthy, is taking care of the house, is keeping up with the rent, basically a perfect tenant, while your wife's sister might not be.

I think the right thing to do is let your friend continue to rent your house. As you've said he hasn't done anything wrong. And honestly you have no idea what's going on happen with the SIL. She could end up changing her mind and going back to the husband and you would have hurt your friend for no reason. You've even offered to help the SIL financially. Don't let them bully you into ousting your friend.", "NTA. She\u2019s asking you to break a commitment and then totally subsidize her sister\u2019s housing.", "NTA.\n\nI don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair to kick someone out for another person (if that person isn\u2019t you, moving home). It\u2019s a huge deal to move out of a house and very stressful and I don\u2019t know that it would be fair to do that.\n\nI\u2019m sorry that your SIL is going through a hard time\u2026 but she can find another place to live.  That responsibility isn\u2019t yours and it shouldn\u2019t be your burden\u2026", "NTA\n\nYou were already very generous in letting her other sister stay in your inherited home.  \n\nShe left because she wanted to move back to her parents.  And your friend who needed some help is living there under the same requirements as your first SIL \n\nIt\u2019s your house that you inherited.  So you wife can ask you how much longer your friend plans to rent from you but if he isn\u2019t ready to move out yet then second SIL needs to look elsewhere.  It isn\u2019t like she will be homeless or living in her car.  \n\nAnd yes your nuclear family\u2019s needs, which is your wife and any kids you have, would take priority over your friend\u2019s needs depending on what the lease you signed with him says.  But your SIL is not your nuclear family and her wants don\u2019t trump your friend\u2019s needs IMO.", "I have certain friends who I value more than family in certain contexts. Just something to think about.", "NTA Don't do it. Our relative was going thru a hardship. Gave her the friends and family discount thinking it would be a year or 2 at most and it ended up being years. She was a very good tenant, but we left a lot of $ on the table compared to \"market\" rent (she paid about 75-80% of market) and the carpet got worn, appliances needed repair etc without much extra revenue to cover it. It's very hard to ask family to leave and since it's your \"spare\" house they feel like you won't mind. If you do it, get a lease and have an escalation of the rent written in if you start below market price.", "NTA for many reasons but also I just think you are completely right you should never kick someone out for not doing anything wrong and I think under the circumstances you did the right thing in offering to help chip in for her to get her own place and I hope your wife will understand that eventually but just know you did nothing wrong", "NTA\u2026you\u2019re too nice.

It\u2019s your house, and while \u201cfamily first \u201c is a nice thought. It\u2019s often a horrible thing in reality.", "NTA. However depending on where you live, if your friend has gotten mail at this residence, whether or not there is a contract, he has established residency and you **can't** kick him out without going through the proper channels for a legal eviction. Which can take anywhere from weeks to months to settle in court before an eviction actually takes place. All in which time your SIL still wouldn't be able to use your home.", "NTA.", "NTA", "NTA. Bummer for SIL, but them\u2019s the breaks.", "This is an ethical problem and never ever do something unethical no matter who asks it. You may lose for not doing, i don't know what your wife would do, but you will lose more if you do, your self-esteem, at least. And she will absolutely use your lack of ethics and you will have no argument for not wanting to do what she wants and go deeper and deeper.", "Not knowing where you  live it is hard to say with certainty, but even if you don't have a signed lease, your friend could put up a fuss and make it very difficult to get rid of. Where I live once you establish tenancy (and that is really very easy to do), you literally have to be evicted even if you are not paying rent. Squatter's rights. Such a charming term. Anyway, your friend is not a squatter and is paying rent, even if just a token amount. He deserves better treatment than what your wife is suggesting.", "You helped your friend out for 9 months, you have been a good friend but now someone else needs help.

Especially if I were trying to get out of a marriage gone bad. That said, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s unreasonable to say no. Your friend has been a good tenant, he\u2019s doing you a favour, don\u2019t wanna rock the boat. \n\nYou mentioned that your wife is mad - is there a chance that it\u2019s more concern about her sister, nephew, and mother?

OP, check your municipal laws on notice to evict (regardless of the reason).", "NTA\n\nMy husband and I had a rental at one time and my sister plus her family were looking for a place to rent. My mom said I should get rid of our renters and rent to them. I told her the renters have done nothing wrong and I am not going to get rid of them. She wasn\u2019t happy but I told her that\u2019s not right. My sister and her family had just started looking but were not going to be homeless. They found a rental soon but I still don\u2019t feel like I did anything wrong. \n\nKeep making good decisions.", "NTA. Don't do that to your friend. Also, if sil has a kid, being real here, they will NEVER LEAVE. And it will always be about \"making a child homeless.\" Avoid it all", "So your wife is ready to go to court and pay damages and fines for kicking out a good tenant. Plus she can pay in repair all the things her family. Your wife can raise the money to built her sister a place to live.", "Just because SIL2\u2019s personal circumstances have changed, doesn\u2019t mean yours or your tenant\u2019s have. \n\nIf I were in your position OP, no matter how hard it is, I wouldn\u2019t evict my friend from the current arrangement for SIL2. \n\nI\u2019d help out where I reasonably could, but not by evicting the friend. Ask your wife how SHE would feel in tenant/friends position. Would she happily move for the family member? I doubt it. Would she still be friends, or would resentment fester and bitterness set in? \n\nI\u2019m sorry you\u2019re in this position OP. NTA. \n\n\n\nNTA.", "NTA. When you rent a house it becomes someone's home.  Even if your tenant was a total stranger it would be wrong, and possibly illegal, to kick him out.", "NTA-it is your inheritance. If you wish to have your friend there, that\u2019s the way it is. You already helped her younger sister. You are not obliged to have her other sister live there. Her sisters life decisions are not your responsibility.", "NTA. I can completely understand both sides but I\u2019m definitely in agreement removing your friend from what\u2019s already a successful arrangement would be silly. \n\nEspecially if you\u2019re also offering to help pay for rent for her own place. Why does it have to specifically be your house?", "NTA, it's your house that you inherited, you get final say.", "NTAH", "Not the ahole. But I think you need to be charging a bit more than \u201csymbolic\u201d if it\u2019s gonna be in this high demand.", "NTA\n\nAt the risk of sounding cold,  from the story the SIL made the decision herself to leave her husband not the other way around. She made a choice and not the other way around unless some extreme circumstances were omitted. But that is the assumption I am making without added context. She has to live with those choices and it is not fair to kick out a good tenant and friend. Not to mention, eviction laws can be hard to enforce on bad tenant. I doubt it would be legally sound.", "NTA. I had a similar situation but no family involved. My \u2018friend\u2019 wanted me to evict a young couple so her dead beat son could move in. I refused. End of \u2018friendship.\u2019", "NTA, keep your friend in the home.", "NTA. Like others have said - you *have* a tenant, and that tenant has rights.", "NTA... that would involve going back on your word. The only way this could happen is if you gave your friend lots and lots of notice. This isnt what your SIL2 needs", "Outside of the potential damage, friendship and possible legal issues . \n\nWould she be intending to live there forever at a reduced rent?  It makes more sense for her to be supported at the parents house with childcare etc while she transitions into this new lifestyle and building from that point. \n\n\nMy mother had MH issues growing up so that likely influences my view, but what if she moved into your property and struggled in anyway, be that with employment , finances , or just taking care of things totally alone? \n\nYou\u2019ve already committed to helping your friend and he\u2019s seemingly on the right path. The offer of financial assistance is incredibly generous", "NTA and your SIL the rude ass bastard and entitled prick can go to hell along with your wife.", "NTA \n\nNot sure where you are, in our province tenants have rights. The only way an owner can evict one is by selling the house or moving back in. That does not include other family members who never lived there or are owners being able to move in. \n\nForget the relationship, you have a tenant living in your property. You\u2019ve established a verbal contract, one that you\u2019ve accepted for months.", "Exactly. That and the fact that friends and family equally important when they\u2019re in need. If his friends has proven to be a good tenant, then I don\u2019t think the wife should have even mentioned removing him from the place since she doesn\u2019t own it and he(the friend) is not freeloading.", "I can assure you that, if your friend has taken care of the place to a level of extreme responsibility. Your friend is very scared and wants to stay in protected shelter.\n\nYour sister-in-law with all those kids are going to wreck the place. Seen it before, I'm a realtor with lots of rental experience. Problem with divorcing SIL, is that she will feel entitled in about 3 months, and you'll have a Cascade of problems. And everything will be mentioned as the problem was already there when she moved in.\n\nIf you're going to let your sister-in-law move in. Hire a professional property inspector just like when you buy a property, tell them you don't need the inspection stamp but you need to find every problem with a photograph. You want to documented that you left the house to her in a specific quality and condition. Because it's going to come back and bite you so hard you have never felt like the exorcist  your head spinning.\n\nI can't stress enough to do the inspection. It'll also protect you from any potential liability and lawsuit. I don't put it past anybody anymore to sue a family member. Cuz it's easy money, and because the house doesn't have a mortgage it's full of equity", "This seems as simple as \"first come first served\". And this is his friend's home now. It's not fair to arbitrarily kick him out. Op could explain it as \"if I start renting it out based on who is \"most important\" to us or who needs it more we'll be opening up a huge door of annoyances hurt feelings and destroyed relationships. Not to mention your sister has a back up option and we will be helping her, my friend doesn't have that luxury. This way we help both parties instead unnecessarily sacrificing one for the other.\"\n\nI wouldn't mention the inevitable damage from the dogs or the kids, apart from them making a flimsy promise to not damage anything (and since they promise not to damage anything you have no reason not to give them the house) it would likely just insult the sister and wife and cause a bigger issue.", "OP really shouldn\u2019t have offered to help with rent. Overly generous. These SILs are adults. They need to pay their own bills like adults!", "That was my thought exactly. The SIL is lucky to have her parents to move in with. Friend would probably end up homeless or couch surfing, if lucky. Let the friend stay, and if things change..\ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "No, his wife is being an AH and only thinking of her sister. She doesn't give a S\\*\\*\\* about the friend living there now.", "Especially a friend during holidays! NTA! Very few move on nye!", "She's not, but she changes when her family is involved", "I'm honestly tempted", "You're absolutely right, she's been talking about leaving him for almost a year", "If he lost the wife over that\u2026 she isn\u2019t the one for him.", "If the wife wants to leave for this stupid reason, he should pack his bags and move to that house himself", "He didn't say she even asked, he said his wife wanted to offer it to her. Don't malign the SIL.", "No, not Immediately but by January", "My house is fairly close to theirs, and has more space and bedrooms (3vs2), she hasn't said directly she wants it, but is implied in how she mentions it", "Also this is your parents home\u2026 not your wife\u2019s home. I hope she can respect your family enough to know that you already did one SIL a favour which was very kind of you\u2026. Don\u2019t burn bridges with your friend over this\u2026.", "So your argument about OP lack of ethics is kicking out Op friend to the streets so his SIL can rent the place. Do you see any irony in your comment about \u201clack of ethics\u201d because he\u2019s not doing what his wife wants?", "I actually considered this for a second, but my friend works from home and a noisy kid running around is out of the question", "I mean he already offered to rent sis a different place. But nooooo wifey says it has to be this one. She needs a Real Shit talk with someone to smack some sense back into her.", "It's not cool to dump a reliable tenant for an entitled family member.  It's his house, not his wife's in any way.", "LAME.\n\nWhy kick out a tenant that has proven they're responsible and reliable? That is absolute bs. Especially since there's no proof OP's SIL will meet that standard. Hard NTA.", "SIL has a familial family home to go back to, where is the friend supposed to go? Especially in this days economy?", "Sister in Law", "And in my province - you can\u2019t even evict somebody if you sell or move back in. Only the landlord and tenant board can do that.\n\nNta - I understand where your wife is coming from, family is important. But kicking your friend out would be an asshole move.\n\nYou don\u2019t have a space available to help her. There\u2019s nothing you can do.\n\nBut if you did decide to kick your friend out in favour of your sil, I hope that everything everyone is predicting will come to pass because you\u2019d be a huge asshole and deserve it.", "As soon as I read son and dog I knew what OP\u2019s future would be,\na wrecked house. Kids destroy houses and quickly. I\u2019d much rather have a tenant with an animal than a child.", "You helped out one sister, and offered to help the other sister in another reasonable way. \n\nIf you\u2019re wanting your friend there for another year and haven\u2019t got a contract in place, I\u2019d make one asap and that will solve the issue for now.\n\nIf you don\u2019t need the money from his rent, put it into a seperate fund and say it\u2019s for the older sister, and your wife and her family is welcome to contribute to it if they want to help out.", "I\u2019m sorry but she very much is if she can\u2019t see how wrong this would be to kick out anyone but especially a friend in this housing crisis. You don\u2019t get a pass on being unkind or entitled just because it\u2019s family.", "Ya my husband gets like this as well and I\u2019ve reminded him that I am his family too. In the same way that you are your wife\u2019s. What\u2019s in your best interest should be paramount, and that\u2019s having a consistent caretaker for that house and maintaining your friendship. Your SIL will be fine with her parents.", "I was just thinking the same, haha.", "lol, the wife can move into a new place with her sister, the kid and the dog!", "That's pretty much immediately.", "For something like this you'd at least want to give your friend 3 months to find new accommodations. Legally its only 1 month, but its a kick in the pants to do that to someone. \n\nHonestly, I think you should tell your wife to back off and let her parents take care of your SIL instead of screwing over your friend.\n\nNTA", "To clarify, does SIL2 want to move to your house? I don\u2019t think it\u2019s your wife place to offer something that\u2019s not hers to someone who hasn\u2019t asked, and who likely wants to stay with her parents to help her in her new normal for the next year.", "Wondering how long your friend and you have been friends? It really doesn't make a difference. I wouldn't kick the friend out, just wondering.", "Nope. Doing what his wife is unethical. He would pay no matter what he does. In my opinion, the price of acting unethical will be more severe. I don't see the irony.", "He is a house/sitter tenet paying minimal while he goes through a rough patch. for nine months appears the entitled one to me. The only one entitled is the bro who wants to keep his free ride going.  \n\nIt is in OPs power to help out his family and work with his wife to solve a problem.  Instead he is more interested in his bromance. He leaves his wife dangling. Nothing admirable about him at all, and the fact he sees his behavior as admirable makes my head spin.", "1) Because they took him in as a favor because he was going through a rough patch and they happen to need a sitter. Now they don\u2019t need a sitter, does that leave them on the hook for as long as rough patch needs it? Since when did he get a free ride because? \n\n2) He married into a family; this means they aRE HIS FAMIlY too! His nephew and sister-in-law are in crisis. No where does he say they are irresponsible, just they are homeless living with her parents.  If his wife is in distress he is in distress. He needs to cut the bromance and man up.", "Ohhh, that makes so much more sense", "Agreed.  When booking hotels I call ahead to ask what their policy is about children. \"Family friendly\" hotels are wrecked.  Teeth marks on armchairs and weird stuff lost under the bed that stinks after a while, grubby finger marks on windows and walls.  Not interested.\n\nI'd rather stay somewhere that allowed pets than children because children are vicious tornadoes, and those rooms don't get cleaned very well as it is and they know the next family they put in there is just going to do it again so why bother?", "Ok Boomer...", "She has insinuated (not sure if that word is correct), as she always does to get her way", "\ud83e\udd2e", "I'm not a boomer.  I don't even want to live in the same building with children, much less trust them not to destroy the place.  They are loud and parenting is not trendy these days.  I work from home.  I don't need to hear your kid teething while you're trying to make another one.", "No, you do not insinuate moving into a place that is already occupied. That\u2019s a dick move. I can see why she\u2019s getting a divorce. But she did decide to move back with her PARENTS, not your house. And she hasn\u2019t asked explicitly. She has massive support behind her, I\u2019m guessing your friend only has you. If this was a jointly owned house with your wife you would still need to both agree. Your wife really has no say here. Ask your wife how much she\u2019ll contribute to your friend as compensation."]}
