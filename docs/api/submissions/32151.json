It would make more sense to leave him in place, taking care of the house, then upend everything. She could go into the house and two months later decide to go somewhere else, leaving you to find someone to fill the hole in the home again. I doubt your friend would go back out of fear of being kicked out again if she changes her mind. \n\nI'm also being selfish here. Don't know how old the kid is, but the addition of a kid and dog would probably mean damage to your things that you left, or at least having to move it to storage to make room for the two. \n\nI feel your offer of assisting with rent is more than fair, your friend deserves to stay in the house, and your SIL needs to find something else out.", "NTA.

Meaning, you couldn't evict you friend until February as we are into December. I assume SIL needs a place to stay before then.\n\nAlso... As the home was YOUR inheritence, you want to keep any rental income and repairs away from your marital assets, or you are giving away half your inheritance to your wife in the event of a divorce.\n\nThe house should have NOTHING to do with your marriage.

SIL already has a workable plan that allows her the family support she currently needs. Not to mention that once she moves herself, child and pet into a home she can\u2019t afford as a single mother, she\u2019s never going to leave.

Besides it would would just be wrong to kick him out.", "It's not like she is homeless she was going to her parents, who can help with her son. I get your Sister wants to be the hero in the story. But your SIL may be best with her parents and if she reconciles with the husband and moves back. Now you have kicked your friend out and the house is empty.  Too many variables here that don't make sense to kick him out while he is paying rent and taking care of the home for you. And agrees to your conditions on visiting. \n\nTo keep the peace, I would say give it six months if she is still at the parents house. You can revisit the conversation.", "NTA. Your friend was there first and is a great tenant. SIL can move with her parents, you dont owe her anything. It would be different if the house wasnt occupied. Keep communication open with your friend, as it seems your wife would not be above trying to manipulate him to leave to get her way.", "NTA, if you ran the rental as a business would you feel right kicking tenants out every time someone in the family could use it?", "NTA. \n\nAlso, kicking him out by January could be illegal where you live without a hefty payout. Where I am, you need to give a minimum of 3 months notice and last month free rent to evict for family/landlord to move back into the place.

It took me a couple times before I permanently left my EX.  Happens.  Probably be good for SIL to stay with parents since they can help with childcare and getting her safely on her feet.\n\nFamily rentals tend me to nightmares here on Reddit so you won't get much push back from anyone who's been around awhile.", "NTA\n\n1.) it is your house\n\n2.) your friend has proven to be trustworthy, is taking care of the house, is keeping up with the rent, basically a perfect tenant, while your wife's sister might not be.

I think the right thing to do is let your friend continue to rent your house. As you've said he hasn't done anything wrong. And honestly you have no idea what's going on happen with the SIL. She could end up changing her mind and going back to the husband and you would have hurt your friend for no reason. You've even offered to help the SIL financially. Don't let them bully you into ousting your friend.", "NTA. She\u2019s asking you to break a commitment and then totally subsidize her sister\u2019s housing.", "NTA.\n\nI don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair to kick someone out for another person (if that person isn\u2019t you, moving home). It\u2019s a huge deal to move out of a house and very stressful and I don\u2019t know that it would be fair to do that.\n\nI\u2019m sorry that your SIL is going through a hard time\u2026 but she can find another place to live.  That responsibility isn\u2019t yours and it shouldn\u2019t be your burden\u2026", "NTA\n\nYou were already very generous in letting her other sister stay in your inherited home.  \n\nShe left because she wanted to move back to her parents.  And your friend who needed some help is living there under the same requirements as your first SIL \n\nIt\u2019s your house that you inherited.  So you wife can ask you how much longer your friend plans to rent from you but if he isn\u2019t ready to move out yet then second SIL needs to look elsewhere.  It isn\u2019t like she will be homeless or living in her car.  \n\nAnd yes your nuclear family\u2019s needs, which is your wife and any kids you have, would take priority over your friend\u2019s needs depending on what the lease you signed with him says.  But your SIL is not your nuclear family and her wants don\u2019t trump your friend\u2019s needs IMO.", "I have certain friends who I value more than family in certain contexts. Just something to think about.", "NTA Don't do it. Our relative was going thru a hardship. Gave her the friends and family discount thinking it would be a year or 2 at most and it ended up being years. She was a very good tenant, but we left a lot of $ on the table compared to \"market\" rent (she paid about 75-80% of market) and the carpet got worn, appliances needed repair etc without much extra revenue to cover it. It's very hard to ask family to leave and since it's your \"spare\" house they feel like you won't mind. If you do it, get a lease and have an escalation of the rent written in if you start below market price.", "NTA for many reasons but also I just think you are completely right you should never kick someone out for not doing anything wrong and I think under the circumstances you did the right thing in offering to help chip in for her to get her own place and I hope your wife will understand that eventually but just know you did nothing wrong", "NTA\u2026you\u2019re too nice.

It\u2019s your house, and while \u201cfamily first \u201c is a nice thought. It\u2019s often a horrible thing in reality.", "NTA. However depending on where you live, if your friend has gotten mail at this residence, whether or not there is a contract, he has established residency and you **can't** kick him out without going through the proper channels for a legal eviction. Which can take anywhere from weeks to months to settle in court before an eviction actually takes place. All in which time your SIL still wouldn't be able to use your home.", "NTA.", "NTA", "NTA. Bummer for SIL, but them\u2019s the breaks.", "This is an ethical problem and never ever do something unethical no matter who asks it. You may lose for not doing, i don't know what your wife would do, but you will lose more if you do, your self-esteem, at least. And she will absolutely use your lack of ethics and you will have no argument for not wanting to do what she wants and go deeper and deeper.", "Not knowing where you  live it is hard to say with certainty, but even if you don't have a signed lease, your friend could put up a fuss and make it very difficult to get rid of. Where I live once you establish tenancy (and that is really very easy to do), you literally have to be evicted even if you are not paying rent. Squatter's rights. Such a charming term. Anyway, your friend is not a squatter and is paying rent, even if just a token amount. He deserves better treatment than what your wife is suggesting.", "You helped your friend out for 9 months, you have been a good friend but now someone else needs help.

Especially if I were trying to get out of a marriage gone bad. That said, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s unreasonable to say no. Your friend has been a good tenant, he\u2019s doing you a favour, don\u2019t wanna rock the boat. \n\nYou mentioned that your wife is mad - is there a chance that it\u2019s more concern about her sister, nephew, and mother?

Secondly your wife's family is not above your friend, they are actually on the same level so you don't owe them anything, you are not responsible for them.

Your wife is also kind of an asshole in this situation because she also thinks nothing of throwing somebody out on the street.. Both your friend and your sister-in-law are in bad situations it would seem, the difference is your friend had nowhere to go where as your sister-in-law could have stayed where she was until she found another place. The fact that you offered to help her with rent so that she could move to another place demonstrates that you do care about her situation so you want to help but now you're being made to feel like crap because your friend also needed help and he got there first. If I were you I would stand my ground and not throw your friend out because he hasn't done anything wrong.

If she is feeling insecure about it, then full disclosure is a good way to start being financial partners in your relationship. Talk about your concerns and find out what your long term financial goals are and work on those together.\n\nAlso, do some research on the rental laws in your location. Your tenant has rights in most jurisdictions, even if you don\u2019t have a lease. It is in your best interest to know exactly where you stand legally with your rental property and tenants. I also suggest drawing up and signing a lease with your current tenant and never renting your property again without a signed lease.
