God, I worry about all the internalized shit that they\u2019re going to deal with. \n\nA lot of people are going to sit here and tell you that you did the right thing, that you stood up for yourself but not me. You\u2019re a little coward who brought innocent children into a fucking racist mess and you should be ashamed. And if you said you didn\u2019t know, then even worse.", "You need to leave. There\u2019s no love there at all", "NTA\n\nWhere were the kids during this conversation as I'm assuming they were with you?  Did they hear what was said?\n\nHow old are the kids.  Teenagers could be 13 and 14 or it could mean 17 and 19.\n\nHow 'black' are the kids and what do their racist grandparents think of them?  Do they spend any time with them?  A whiter child might be more liked than a dark complexion child.\n\nIs your wife okay with her children being called the N word?  Either by anyone, or what about her grandparents?  I'm not sure you could call it a term of endearment even if does come out of their grandparents mouths.\n\nYour wife either doesn't know how to stand up to her parents or she believes what they are saying.\n\nDoes your wife work at all?  Or are you the only one providing an income?", "Correction. You need to have a serious conversation with yourself and decide if you want to continue being married to a woman that thinks it's okay for her family to not only speak about like that, but to you like that as well. She has shown you true and racist colors. Believe them. \n\nShe may not think she feels the same way as her family, but the fact she is defending them says she feels that way about YOU. This will not change. You have some long, hard thinking to do. You may need to tell her she does, too. Then the two of have some serious decisions to make.", "Thank you for asking this, I had never heard of this either.  Very thankful that this thread explained well enough to understand what and why this is terrible, and in a kind and informative way.\n\nNta op. I'm so sorry you're dealing with this. I really and truly hope you and your wife can find a healthier way to proceed for the children's sake", "She\u2019s denying that they were being racist. She says they were just trying to help me.", "She's normalised it, not recognising what her family are saying is understandably interpreted as offensive because it's \"just how they are\", a standard enabling excuse. The family straight up said OP was either too dangerous or non-committed to the kids and she didn't hear it as racism.\n\nOP needs to watch the access the kids have to their mother's side of the family because just by being bi-racial they may be getting derogatory treatment.", "Omg of course NTA but next time, as soon as it happens, call out to your wife and repeat exactly what they said, in front of them. \n\nI\u2019ve don\u2019t this before. Works like a charm. Your spouse can\u2019t accuse you of exaggerating and the perp can\u2019t deny it. \u201cHey wife, your dad just said\u2026\u201d\n\nNow, of course it should have never happened, and I\u2019m astonished your wife has never heard their attitude\u2026 but let\u2019s call them all out. How are they to your children?", "Interesting.  It's not a racist slur where I am so I would never have worked out what the P word was.", "Better yet, ask the wife if she plans on joining in! \n\nNTA"]}
