She already owns a home that she is making money as an airbnb.  She's tacky and cheap.", "Meh, I'm going mild YTA. I mean, does it really matter if the $ you would have spent on a butter dish goes to something else instead? It's pretty common for people to register for honeymoons & add-ons to them now, and those often don't allow for a smaller gift than the $250/person scuba dive or something like that. At least with this \"housing fund\" they're making it super simple for you to support their married lives together. \nI say don't stretch your budget to contribute a higher amount than you would have on a traditional gift & then move on. If that's $40 then it's $40 toward their mortgage & literally makes no difference to you in the end.", "Soft YTA, just give them what you\u2019d normally spend on a wedding gift. This isn\u2019t the time to be passive aggressive with a charity donation and try to make a point. If you can\u2019t truly celebrate the couple them just don\u2019t go.", "ESH. It sounds like she doesn\u2019t need money for a house, so it\u2019s kinda tacky to ask for it. But, bottom line, they want cash as wedding gifts. For you to give yourself a gift for their wedding is just as tacky, and that\u2019s what you\u2019d be doing. Donating to a charity YOU want to support instead of one they\u2019ve asked for a donation to and support. Either don\u2019t give a gift, give what they\u2019ve asked for, or give them something they can use.", "NTA \u2014 it\u2019s still tacky asking when you already have a house, have little/no debt, a great job, and don\u2019t need it. It\u2019s really selfish.\n\nYour idea of a charitable donation in their name is great! I\u2019d do that.", "YTA. Don't give any more than you normally would but do you really care if you $ goes to a home making item or the mortgage? Is it possible they are looking to upsize for any possible children in the near future?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Yes she\u2019s exploiting her parents. But that\u2019s between her and her parents.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to join in her lowbrow approach to life by making a big deal about it. Else, don\u2019t go to the wedding, don\u2019t get them a gift and hold your ground.", "Light YTA. I wouldn't necessarily call the wedding gift request \"tacky\"- I actually know a number of couples that asked for honeymoon/home saving donations in lieu of traditional gifts. It seems like a pretty common trend among millennial couples nowadays. Her rationale towards wanting to put together a house fund might be confusing, but honestly the time of wedding gifting isn't really the time to get super hung up on personal ethics. If you don't want to respect the wishes of the bridal couple then you shouldn't attend the wedding. And if you're willing to put money towards a charity or whatever, there's no reason why it should make a difference to you if that money goes to a nest egg instead.", "Personally I don\u2019t see the issue. People ask for gifts at a wedding anyway why is this any different to buying them a gift. It\u2019s better than people wasting money buying gifts they don\u2019t want or need. You don\u2019t even have to give them much money for it", "Soft YTA. Why does it matter to you where the money goes? Give to the couple or don\u2019t. Why purposefully give the amount you\u2019d spend on the couple elsewhere just to prove a point?", "NTA - you feel the way you feel. But giving to a charity \"in their name\" isn't giving them a gift at at. It will come across as that your intention is to stick it to them and it will cause a rift in your friendship. They won't learn some bigger message. So, if you were planning to buy them a $100 gift just give them the cash (or some cash), if you were planning to give them something more person, go ahead and do that.", "I think a donation in their name would be very nice.", "YTA. Wedding gifts are for what the couple wants, not necessarily what they need. By your description, they are well-off enough to afford any household items or honey moon plans they'd like, so they don't NEED those either. Maybe they want to pay off their mortgage faster. Maybe they want to upgrade. Maybe they're waiting for a better time to sell and buy a home that's an upgrade when housing and interest rates come down. The fact that you're upset that the money that you'll spend on their GIFT is going where they want it the most, rather than where you think is more appropriate, is just bizarre to me.", "Okay, but by that logic, she\u2019s also exploiting her wedding guests. We\u2019re in the position of not going/not contributing and looking like assholes, or going and paying for something she\u2019s not bothering paying for- her parents and Airbnb are. I guess that\u2019s kind of my hang up, wedding gifts are meant to celebrate and improve the quality of life for the couple, and I know it\u2019s not my job to teach her.\n\nI also had to edit that not going isn\u2019t a option- without getting into it, it would be noticed and offensive. \n\nThis is the third time she\u2019s made the request (both prior engagement parties), she\u2019s offered no alternatives, and it\u2019s obvious that since her and her fianc\u00e9 don\u2019t want for anything (wedding/honeymoon are paid for) and she knows guests bring gifts, she\u2019s asking for this instead.", "Totally fine with honeymoon/home funds, and I\u2019ve given to those in the past.\n\nIt\u2019s the fact she owns a home, is asking for us to pay her mortgage, while she lives with her mother and is contributing nothing there, while making money on her own property.\n\nIt\u2019s strange to ask loved ones to pay your bills while you\u2019re living on someone else\u2019s dime, and cashing in on this property you\u2019re having us pay for.", "That\u2019s true- the charity thing isn\u2019t to teach them anything, I just don\u2019t feel like there\u2019s anything I can give them that they\u2019d want or use. We\u2019re very different people lol. \n\nOther weddings I\u2019ve been to, where the couple already has a house and wedding/honeymoon is paid for, they ask for charitable donations to causes they care about. I figured it would be a non-offense option, but I could see it looking passive aggressive.", "Does it matter what she's calling it? If you were going to spend $150, then you contribute $150. Where that's allocated is not your concern.\n\nIf you want to donate to a charity, you can have your own event and ask for donations to a charity of your choice. \n\nIf you're envious of these people or find them greedy and not worth your time, end your friendship and don't attend the wedding.", "Unfortunately, not going to the wedding isn\u2019t an option, because I would decline. Long story short, my absence would be noticed and I already bailed on one of the engagement parties because I didn\u2019t want to contribute to their house and not show up without a gift.\n\nI think where the difference lies in wedding gifts are typically given to help improve the quality of the life of the couple- either upgrading home goods, being able to have a nicer honeymoon, etc. Thats how you celebrate the couple.\n\nThe guests contributions would be going to a 30 year mortgage, basically thrown into a well, one she\u2019s avoiding to pay currently by living with her parents without contributing to them (firsthand account from her mother), and generating a passive income with.\n\nI get all money just goes into a \u201cpool\u201d at the end of the day, but this isn\u2019t improving the quality of their lives and no one\u2019s been given an alternative. If every guest went and gave a gift, we all would\u2019ve given 3 contributions to her mortgage that she\u2019s not even paying- her parents and Airbnb are. And now her wedding guests too.", "It doesn\u2019t matter in the end tho, does it? If you\u2019re giving her money to help for her \u201chouse\u201d then that frees up money for her to buy things for said house like upgrading home goods as you mentioned is acceptable."]}
