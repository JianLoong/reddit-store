Maybe they want to upgrade. Maybe they're waiting for a better time to sell and buy a home that's an upgrade when housing and interest rates come down.

My husband's cousin got married shortly before we did (her's had been planned for the previous year, but Covid!), and in lieu of gifts, they wanted monetary donations at least enough to cover the plate. All fair, right? \n\nWell, the plates were 150$ a pop, and to top it all off, the man she was marrying was an actual millionaire. They already had two houses, cars, a boat, fancy vacations, the like. The wedding was over 100K, and the bride's dress cost more than my own catering and hall combined, lol. Needless to say, we did not give them 300$, although we did give them some money. It felt a little outrageous though, for poor us to be asked by a millionaire to pay for his wedding. NTA.", "NTA\n\nI would give the mom a check \"for rent on behalf of the married couple\".

NTA.", "In Korea, it's tradition for the guests to give cash to the bride and groom at the wedding (when you arrive to the wedding, you put your cash in an envelope with your name then place the envelope in a box), to help offset the costs of the wedding or honeymoon. I don't see any problem with providing cash in lieu of a gift, I don't see a difference between giving money verses a gift. I guess the only problem would be stating that the money was for the house if it's already paid for. I think maybe if they just said they would prefer cash over a gift and omitted the house part OP would have less qualms about it, but even then I don't think it matters that much, you're giving them cash regardless at the end of the day.", " it's also worth considering the cultural and emotional aspects of gift-giving. Some people believe that giving a physical gift or something symbolic adds a personal touch to the celebration and reflects the giver's thoughtfulness and care.

What good would giving unwanted gifts do when you can far more easily give the exact same amount in cash?", "Two of my closest friends married each other last summer. They had provided two registries - a traditional one for gifts and a monetary one for their honeymoon / house  (the groom moved into the bride\u2019s house and it needed renovations). I didn\u2019t know which one to use so I texted them and asked which they honestly preferred - cash or the air fryer? The bride responded that she only set up the traditional registry because her mom insisted on it, as older relatives preferred to send an actual gift. That\u2019s all she said and didn\u2019t tell me they preferred the cash, but the message was clear. So I priced the air fryer and gave them the equivalent in cash. Everyone was happy and even if they didn\u2019t spend my exact cash gift on honeymoon / house, I didn\u2019t care. It was a gift and they could use it however they wanted! Let them buy groceries or a new toilet or a special night out. When I give someone a birthday gift, I don\u2019t demand to know exactly how / when they\u2019re going to use it, wear it or or display it. A wedding gift is no different. Especially if the couple are older and established, they don\u2019t need help  setting up their new home together. One of them probably already owns a blender.\n\nIf I wasn\u2019t a close friend, I wouldn\u2019t have texted and asked, but I\u2019m close enough to actually care that they liked my gift. Many newlyweds just return any unneeded gifts and use the cash anyway, and that\u2019s their business. \n\nI\u2019ve been to weddings where the couple specifically asked that all gifts be donations made to a specific cause, rather than to themselves. It\u2019s not uncommon for wealthier people and / or people who are strongly devoted to a specific cause. \n\nA wedding is a special celebration of love for two people committing to each other and starting their lives together. Give them the gift that they want! It\u2019s not that difficult. It\u2019s about *them*, not the guest that they invited to share the moment with.", "Yeah, I\u2019m clearly picking up who\u2019s reading the entire post or skimming and reading comments and making assumptions.", "Not sure what you\u2019re asking here tbh. Their current home is an investment property, because they aren\u2019t living in it, they\u2019re making money off of it, thus an investment property.

Unbelievable!

This isn\u2019t fair!\u201d\n(OP, probably)\n\nSeriously though, traditional wedding gifts barely make sense anymore. Most people getting married have already set up their household, and they have mostly likely combined said households, so now they have 2 of everything.

Could do without the cheesy housing fund line but they probably schemes that up together to seem desperate to their wedding guests.
