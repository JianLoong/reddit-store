Maybe they want to upgrade. Maybe they're waiting for a better time to sell and buy a home that's an upgrade when housing and interest rates come down.

Where I live (Deep South) it\u2019s customary to give a gift that\u2019s roughly the equivalent of v the meal. It\u2019s not unheard of to give someone a card with cash.

Depending on the situation, and how the bride is asking, it might be more honest for her to just say the fund will be going towards a house. \n\nIf you gave a regular gift, you\u2019d have no say in what she did with that after the wedding, so why are you being judgey about how she would use your cash gift?
