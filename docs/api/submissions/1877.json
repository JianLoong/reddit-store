My mom has made some very bad decisions, my brother and I were taken from her as young kids due to unlivable environment. She lived off spousal support from my dad for ten years until it ran out. Put me in 10K of debt through HS and college as I took care of her and paid our bills. My boyfriend (now husband) even paid some bills for her in high school. She never worked. Freeloaded everyone. \n\nI eventually moved out with my husband. We have a newborn and I have lost my job so I\u2019m working multiple freelance gigs to make ends meet as I interview places. My brother cut her off. She\u2019s been living with her parents for years, got a part time job last year\u2026 but my grandma recently died and grandpa went into a home. So she\u2019s been living in a mobile home paying some rent. Well not paying full rent caught up to her.\n\nShe went to a motel but now has run out of money. Could basically be homeless tomorrow. Am I the asshole for not financially helping her? Living with me is not an option due to space, my newborn, her dog, my relationship, etc. While I have savings, I feel like I need that to be mine especially since I was laid off. My husband and I have worked very hard (60+ hour weeks) for years to have our home and our life and have saved as much as we could for emergencies. I just don\u2019t know if I\u2019m the asshole to not help her. \n\nShe claims she just needs one night as she has a loan coming through soon. My fear is one night, opening that door, turns into more and more. I love my mom but I don\u2019t want to keep enabling her.  Could I afford one night? Yes. But\u2026 I\u2019m opening that door I feel. \n\nAm I the asshole?", "created_utc": 1667977382, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yqbcu2/aita_mother_possibly_homeless/", "score": 40, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your mom is exhibiting learned helplessness.  People will always bail her out and she expects it.  It\u2019s going to be a hard lesson but she\u2019s got to get her act together.  If she has to go stay in a women\u2019s shelter it may be the wake-up call she needs to finally pull her weight.", "NTA \"She claims she just needs one night as she has a loan coming through soon.\" Bullshit. The only loan she would be eligible for would be from people that make her un-alive if she doesn't pay it. And you know she will NEVER repay it. You WOULD be TA if you gave her any more financial assistance because you would be enabling her. Do not open that door - don't even look through the peephole. Don't fuck up your life. Your CHILD needs you - your mom needs to be left to suffer the consequences of a life of bad decisions and taking advantage of others. I know that sounds harsh, but that's life.", "Definitely NTA, it is totally okay to say that you\u2019re not in a place financially where you can lend out money like that", "NTA.\n\nPoverty is horrible, and she's desperate, but that doesn't mean you can help her.", "NTA. You're not responsible for your Mom. Her situation is really sad, but you're correct in thinking you may be enabling her by letting her stay even one night.", "NTA.  Lock and bar that door.  Remind yourself that she is an ADULT capable of caring for herself, she just chooses not to.  This is not your burden to carry.  You have your family now that is priority.  No shame in that whatsoever.  If you must, send her a giftcard.  Other than that, let it be.", "NTA. You don't owe your mom anything and it sounds like she's finally reaping what she sows. It's time for her to find a job and start financially supporting herself.\n\nSome people gotta hit rock bottom before they can actually start climbing out of the gutter. Eventually you got no where to go but up or out of this life.\n\nLet her figure it out. You owe her nothing and have your own baby to look after. She can sink or swim.", "NTA and do not help her. Helping her will only hurt her in this situation. You owe her nothing.", "NTA. And I say that as a mother. She has had her whole life making her own choices and catering for herself, and now you must have your life and put yourself first.\nThis isn't the first pickle she's been in and she'll manage to wing it like she always has, you take care of your wee family and pay her no mind.", "NTA. She wasn\u2019t there for you or your brother when you needed her, then put you in debt at a young age and you know it will never just be one night. I wonder if there\u2019s even a loan coming - or are you expected to be her piggybank again?   \n\n\nYou have your own family now and can\u2019t risk your financial security again for her", "NTA, you're right, opening your home for one night will turn into more and more. If you give her money she'll expect to always receive money from you.", "Obvious NTA", "NTA past experience tells u its a horrible idea, u should pay heed to it's learnings. once a freeloader always a freeloader.", "NTA. You grew up into a responsible adult, no thanks to her. Time she learns to do the same.", "NTA. You don't have to pay it back, ever. Pay it forward, your child takes precedence over your mum 10/10 times(especially your mums dog), she needs to figure it out on her own, maybe let her eat at yours some nights to help with food costs but don't give her any money. I don't know what social programs are available to her but there should be enough to live.\n\nGood luck", "NTA - you are not in a position to help and your experience has taught you that she will drain everything you have and leave nothing for you. But you are a parent now, and she will be taking from your child. \n\nIf that\u2019s not enough to make you draw the hard line, then consider this \u2014 how are you going to get her out of your house? If she\u2019s pushing so many buttons to get into your house, how much worse do you think it will be when you have to kick her out? And you will have to kick her out. You know that she\u2019s not going to leave voluntarily.", "NTA. Do not let her in for a single night. You don\u2019t really have the capacity and she\u2019ll try to make it permanent.", "NTA, you don't owe her. This will never end if you help her. Some lessons are harder to learn", "You can't help her out financially. You don't have much in the way of disposable income. Tell her that. And tell her to get down to the county and apply for some government assistance.\n\nNTA.", "NTA. But this feels way above Reddit's pay grade.\n\nMaybe you could offer to pay for her motel stay for one night, as she claims that's all she needs until her loan comes through. Of course, you are not obliged too and this would only be a kindness and with the benefit of the doubt. Though, honestly, it doesn't seem like the loan is real.\n\nI do hope your mom gets out of this rut she's placed herself into. But sometimes, people just have to reach rock bottom to make them realize they need to pick themselves up.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

She could be suffering from mental health issues, or some form of disability, I'm not sure where you are, many places have resources to help deal with these.

You've escaped her and you know letting her into your home now will be unhealthy for everyone.", "NTA Your first priority for is your husband, baby and you. If you have to take away from them to help her then you definitely shouldn\u2019t do it. What she is asking is taking away so the answer is No. if this was a rare occurrence then I would be saying help her but it\u2019s not. It\u2019s been going on your whole life.

She asked could she at least come over for dinner, I said yes.  She conveniently FELL in the hallway, no witnesses, screamed that she wrenched her back, she was in pain and in spasms, she insisted on staying until she healed, or she threatened to sue me.
