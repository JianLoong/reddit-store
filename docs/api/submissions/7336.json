So I am not supported by dad and his wife. Wanted that out of the way first.\n\nSo anyway. My parents divorced when I was 11. My dad remarried when I was 17. His wife is Haley. Haley's younger sister recently went through a divorce and her two daughters are having a hard time, so she asked me to speak to them because I was the only person she felt she could ask, who had been through a divorce. I said sure. Her girls were honest that they wanted their parents back together and how they hated that both their parents already had a boyfriend and a girlfriend and they just wanted to be a family again, without new people. I told them it was okay to feel that way. They said people have told them they should be glad their parents are doing what makes them happy and that they don't have an unhappy home. I told them that how they feel is okay. That they could be happy that their parents are happier, and still wish that they hadn't been unhappy together. I told them they might be glad some day, or they might never be glad it happened, but still be okay with it and acknowledge that while it was tough, others are far happier. I told them life is messy and divorce can make life messier and our feelings about that are never wrong. I assured them that it can get easier but sometimes you need someone like a therapist to talk about it with. But ultimately, there is nothing wrong with there being sadness when you think about it, just like there's nothing wrong when people are happy their parents divorced. They asked how I felt. I told them I would always wish my parents had been happy together and could have had a happy and healthy marriage together. But I am still glad for them that they are happy. They were happier after the talk.\n\nTheir mom ended up talking to them in front of Haley and she didn't like what the girls had said about her talk. She went to my dad and then the two of them tackled me on saying I would always wish my parents could have been happy together. Haley said if that had happened she wouldn't be in my life and that I should be glad that they divorced so I could grow my family. Dad said I spoke like my brother (long story but he and dad are not close anymore). I told them the girls needed to hear the truth and I hadn't shared with the two of them because I never intended to try and say my parents should have stayed together. But I can feel how I feel. They said I shouldn't ever say it. I told them they could not dictate how I speak to others, and especially to kids who were going through hell and I knew how they felt. They told me I was talking back like a child. They were unhappy with me and I with them.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1673720014, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10bv542/aita_for_telling_my_dad_and_his_wife_that_they/", "score": 1288, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Instead of an intact original family unit? SHE THINKS YOU SHOULD HAVE **WANTED** TO HAVE STEPPARENTS INSTEAD OF HAPPY PARENTS?\n\nHaley is delusional.\n\nIt's one thing to be happy that your parents found love after unhappiness, to make the best of your family breaking up, and to learn to care for new stepparents. All of those things are healthy and good. But what Haley is suggesting is that *back when you still had an intact nuclear family, you should have wished for it to FALL APART so you could \"grow\" it with additional stepparents, etc.* No one wishes for their family to dissolve unless something is very wrong, nor should they.  Haley is very confused, is suggesting something deeply unhealthy, and needs therapy. You can care for her and even love her, but that doesn't mean that you should have wished for a life with her in it back when your family was intact. \n\nYou are NTA, and you're 100% right with everything you told those girls. It was sensitive, thoughtful, and supportive of their complex feelings around their changing family. Good for you!", "NTA  \n\n\nGreat job in sharing your experience in a thoughtful & unbiased way. Sounds like they expected you to do PR for their relationship. So glad you didn't", "NTA\n\nYou were open, honest and no judgemental. You validated their feelings. I don\u2019t think they could have asked for a better talk.\nYour dad and Haley should afford you the same courtesy of allowing you to have your own feelings about life.", "NTA. What you said made sense because there is a high probability of the girls' parents never getting back together and how they feel now is okay and over time they will become okay with the fact that their parents arent together. Your father and his wife are assholes because they're making you feel bad for something that you felt years ago when your parents divorced. Its not about them and it's not like you're not happy for them now.", "NTA.  You are right.  People feel how they feel.  I understand why it might hurt Haley, but that is also okay.

Your dad and step mum are going on the defense and taking your words out of context. They sound insecure. Honestly, I'm really impressed with what you said to the girls and couldn't have said it better myself. Divorce causes trauma, even if the divorce was amicable. You're right, you can wish your parents had a happy marriage but also be happy where they are now. Your step mum is putting words in your mouth and taking it way too personal.", "NTA.\n\nThank goodness these girls have you in their corner, because you are probably the only adult in their life who is validating their emotions during this difficult time rather than telling them to put on a happy face and ignore how difficult everything is.", "NTA.

It\u2019s not about our feelings it\u2019s about theirs. The kids can hope they parents will get back together, it\u2019s up to the parents to set expectations. Parents who put their lives ahead of their kids in any situation is repulsive. It\u2019s downright monstrous in a divorce situation.", "Nta perfectly stated imo", "NTA. They asked you to talk to the girls from your own experience. You did so. They didn't ask you to put any other restrictions on what you'd say to them, and you were under no obligation to accept any such restrictions if they did ask you to. But you especially had no obligation to read their minds about what they wanted, for heaven's sake.", "NTA. Your comments were mature and thoughtful and truthful. There is nothing wrong with wishing you still had your parents together and that they could have worked it out. That is a totally natural feeling that most kids of divorced parents have.

You were asked to talk with the girls because you know what they are going through and could help. That's what you did.

That\u2019s the ideal.

They don't know how to have a friendship, they don't know how to listen and learn from other people's knowledge.", "I am one of the olds so am not good with memes, but isn't this a variation of the whole,\n\"Go do a thing\" / person does a thing / \"no not like that\" family of memes?\n\nThey don't get to ask you for honest and accurate information then get mad when you provide it.\n\nNTA", "Hayley is mad that OP isn\u2019t happy enough about her . LOL, that\u2019s wild \ud83e\udee0", "Exactly, you are supposed to feel the emotions as they happen, not stuff them down because that\u2019s a recipe for unresolved trauma later!", "NTA\n\nIt's pretty clear that OP was expected to tell the girls to just 'suck it up' by putting on happy faces and just 'getting over it' as quickly as possible. Instead, OP had a calm, insightful, compassionate and VALIDATING discussion with the girls which is much, MUCH healthier than what they were demanding from OP.\n\nYou did the right thing. Your parents are acting childish, and will probably continue giving you grief about it, but I think you already know that you did right by those girls.", "NTA they asked you to have a talk with them, clearly your dads wife has a high opinion of herself, they sound like AH\u2019s", "NTA. You said all the things you needed to. You grow your own family in life. It isn't always via your parents, step or otherwise.", "NTA. Your parents are in denial. Stand your ground and tell them this is how you feel, and they cant change the way you feel.\n\nThey are simply expressing their shame.", "I feel exactly the same way. I learned very young it was easier to be the \u201cquiet good kid\u201d and now I\u2019m trying to retrain my brain so I don\u2019t fuck yo my kids and it\u2019s HARD!  I can only hope that it will pay off and they won\u2019t have to struggle this same way.", "Well\u2026 the non-private debrief is why. Who does that? Why would the parent demand to know what OP said, much less in front of Haley? These are not secure people. \n\n(I realize OP never said \u201cdemand\u201d but generally as a parent, I find it super uncool to pump children for information. Especially in the presence of another adult, it\u2019s just disrespectful. The correct move is to get treats and go for a drive and let things emerge.)", "All the OP says is that the mom had a talk with the kids in front of Hayley. It doesn't say the talk was to find out what OP told the kids. The mom speaking to her kids is reasonable since they've clearly been trying to understand the kid's feelings...the whole post is because Hayley and the mom were concerned about kids (if they weren't then OP would never have spoken to the kids). \n\nThe kids talked about what OP said during the talk with the mother. Nothing suggests that the point of the talk was to find out what OP said or interrogate the kids. Also clearly Hayley has been a support system for her sister hence her asking OP to get involved in the first place.\n\nHayley flying off the handle doesn't say anything about the parents pumping kids for information or doing anything other than talking to their kids about the divorce to work through it.", "\"Talking back like a child\". In other words you were having the temerity to stand up for yourself as an adult. Hell no, you are NTA.  They are. I think you did a wonderful job of talking with those kids and they are lucky to have someone like you who understands and validates what they are going through.  To many divorcing parents have an attitude that kids should just suck it up and put on a happy face.  It's unbelievably selfish.", "NTA - they want their kids not having emotional damage efter doing things that make people hurt. You cant erase the hurt of others by telling them how to feel. They're acting very emotionally immature. They need to take responsibility for the hurt they caused.", "NTA - why is Haley so insecure?", "NTA. What? What you said was so level, so even, so reconciliatory...You are not talking 'like a child'. You are being very adult and honest about everything. Your dad and stepmom are selfish children who want everyone to adore them and for no-one to have their own feelings.", "Nta. I wish I had someone like you to talk to my daughter. You were honest and real. You weren\u2019t bitter or angry. You said things that they could relate to. Your parents are making an issue because of THEIR feelings and insecurities. You did good.", "The only people I have met that are glad their parents divorce are ones where one of their parents were abusive or a massive asshole. So by that metric, the parents should be glad OP feels that way."]}
