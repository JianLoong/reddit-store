So I am not supported by dad and his wife. Wanted that out of the way first.\n\nSo anyway. My parents divorced when I was 11. My dad remarried when I was 17. His wife is Haley. Haley's younger sister recently went through a divorce and her two daughters are having a hard time, so she asked me to speak to them because I was the only person she felt she could ask, who had been through a divorce. I said sure. Her girls were honest that they wanted their parents back together and how they hated that both their parents already had a boyfriend and a girlfriend and they just wanted to be a family again, without new people. I told them it was okay to feel that way. They said people have told them they should be glad their parents are doing what makes them happy and that they don't have an unhappy home. I told them that how they feel is okay. That they could be happy that their parents are happier, and still wish that they hadn't been unhappy together. I told them they might be glad some day, or they might never be glad it happened, but still be okay with it and acknowledge that while it was tough, others are far happier. I told them life is messy and divorce can make life messier and our feelings about that are never wrong. I assured them that it can get easier but sometimes you need someone like a therapist to talk about it with. But ultimately, there is nothing wrong with there being sadness when you think about it, just like there's nothing wrong when people are happy their parents divorced. They asked how I felt. I told them I would always wish my parents had been happy together and could have had a happy and healthy marriage together. But I am still glad for them that they are happy. They were happier after the talk.\n\nTheir mom ended up talking to them in front of Haley and she didn't like what the girls had said about her talk. She went to my dad and then the two of them tackled me on saying I would always wish my parents could have been happy together. Haley said if that had happened she wouldn't be in my life and that I should be glad that they divorced so I could grow my family. Dad said I spoke like my brother (long story but he and dad are not close anymore). I told them the girls needed to hear the truth and I hadn't shared with the two of them because I never intended to try and say my parents should have stayed together. But I can feel how I feel. They said I shouldn't ever say it. I told them they could not dictate how I speak to others, and especially to kids who were going through hell and I knew how they felt. They told me I was talking back like a child. They were unhappy with me and I with them.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1673720014, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10bv542/aita_for_telling_my_dad_and_his_wife_that_they/", "score": 483, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

These parents are going to have a rough time with these girls. If they aren't going to validate how these girls feel, they are setting themselves up for some very rebellious teens.\n\nIf they had a script that they wanted you to deliver, they should have told you. You would have refused. This is all on them.", "**NTA**\n\nAnd this . . . this is just WOW:\n\n> two of them tackled me on saying I would always wish my parents could have been happy together. Haley said if that had happened she wouldn't be in my life and that I should be glad that they divorced so I could grow my family.\n\nYou should be GLAD THAT YOUR PARENTS DIVORCED, not because they were unhappy together but so you could . . .  have a bigger family? Instead of an intact original family unit? SHE THINKS YOU SHOULD HAVE **WANTED** TO HAVE STEPPARENTS INSTEAD OF HAPPY PARENTS?\n\nHaley is delusional.\n\nIt's one thing to be happy that your parents found love after unhappiness, to make the best of your family breaking up, and to learn to care for new stepparents. All of those things are healthy and good. But what Haley is suggesting is that *back when you still had an intact nuclear family, you should have wished for it to FALL APART so you could \"grow\" it with additional stepparents, etc.* No one wishes for their family to dissolve unless something is very wrong, nor should they.  Haley is very confused, is suggesting something deeply unhealthy, and needs therapy. You can care for her and even love her, but that doesn't mean that you should have wished for a life with her in it back when your family was intact. \n\nYou are NTA, and you're 100% right with everything you told those girls. It was sensitive, thoughtful, and supportive of their complex feelings around their changing family. Good for you!", "NTA  \n\n\nGreat job in sharing your experience in a thoughtful & unbiased way. Sounds like they expected you to do PR for their relationship. So glad you didn't", "NTA\n\nYou were open, honest and no judgemental. You validated their feelings. I don\u2019t think they could have asked for a better talk.\nYour dad and Haley should afford you the same courtesy of allowing you to have your own feelings about life.", "NTA. What you said made sense because there is a high probability of the girls' parents never getting back together and how they feel now is okay and over time they will become okay with the fact that their parents arent together. Your father and his wife are assholes because they're making you feel bad for something that you felt years ago when your parents divorced. Its not about them and it's not like you're not happy for them now.", "NTA.  You are right.  People feel how they feel.  I understand why it might hurt Haley, but that is also okay.  Sounds like you were appropriate and compassionate with those kids.  Thanks for that.", "NTA\n\nYou were open and honest and they asked you to have the convo so\u2026..\ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nAs a stepparent myself, I have no reason to believe that my steps would have preferred that their parents stayed together. I hoped that my first marriage would have worked out too. That\u2019s not a negative about current relationship. But people don\u2019t marry planning or hoping to divorce.", "NTA.\n\nSometimes the truth hurts.\n\nETA:  what you told the girls reminds me a lot of the ending of Mrs. Doubtfire.", "NTA. Your dad and step mum are going on the defense and taking your words out of context. They sound insecure. Honestly, I'm really impressed with what you said to the girls and couldn't have said it better myself. Divorce causes trauma, even if the divorce was amicable. You're right, you can wish your parents had a happy marriage but also be happy where they are now. Your step mum is putting words in your mouth and taking it way too personal.", "NTA.\n\nThank goodness these girls have you in their corner, because you are probably the only adult in their life who is validating their emotions during this difficult time rather than telling them to put on a happy face and ignore how difficult everything is.", "NTA. You were honest with two girls who needed honesty. I hate this old school parenting view of just insisting kids are ok. \u201cYou\u2019re ok. It\u2019s ok. It\u2019s ok. No, you\u2019re fine\u201d. Like let kids feel their feelings for a hot minute. If you\u2019re sad be sad!! It\u2019s ok to be sad!", "NTA. As a divorced dad, we made sure our kids still came first. It\u2019s not about our feelings it\u2019s about theirs. The kids can hope they parents will get back together, it\u2019s up to the parents to set expectations. Parents who put their lives ahead of their kids in any situation is repulsive. It\u2019s downright monstrous in a divorce situation.", "Nta perfectly stated imo", "NTA. They asked you to talk to the girls from your own experience. You did so. They didn't ask you to put any other restrictions on what you'd say to them, and you were under no obligation to accept any such restrictions if they did ask you to. But you especially had no obligation to read their minds about what they wanted, for heaven's sake.", "NTA. Your comments were mature and thoughtful and truthful. There is nothing wrong with wishing you still had your parents together and that they could have worked it out. That is a totally natural feeling that most kids of divorced parents have. Haley is being immature in how she is handling this. You didn\u2019t say anything wrong.", "NTA\n\nSome parents only see the world through their own eyes. If they are unhappy with their former partner so are the children.\nBut that is not true.\n\nChildren still love both their parents and the dream of growing up in a happy nuclear family.\n\nIf the parents and their new partners respect and accept the children's feeling the children will with time learn that it is better that their parents are not together anymore.\n\nApparently you touched a sore spot with that you told the children but you spoke the truth.", "NTA. You were asked to talk with the girls because you know what they are going through and could help. That's what you did. Sounds like they really wanted you to have approved talking points and only say what they are comfortable with. Nothing you said is out of line and it will probably help them.", "NTA", "They sound toxic af. Seems like your brother has the right idea.", "Nta", "NTA.", "NTA\n\nWhat you told the kids was the truth and validated their feelings. You also let them know that they can feel bad because the parents didn't stay together AND feel ok about them being happy.\n\nYour father's wife seems insecure, which is not uncommon for a step parent, but it is not ok for her or your dad to tell you how to feel or what to say.\n\nI think you did right by those kids.", "NTA Every child wishes their parents were together and happy. That\u2019s the ideal. You acknowledged that\u2019s what the girls were feeling, explained that that doesn\u2019t always happen and it\u2019s ok to be unhappy about that. \n\nYour dad and step are acting like jerks because a) you pressed dad\u2019s divorced parent gilt button.. and he got defensive, b) you made step feel diminished..", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
