However, just because you are not obligated to solve that problem for them, you still are obligated to do your best to warn them of an impending problem.  \n\n***And, finally, what will be more costly in the long run for you . . . saving the cost of half of the fence . . . or breaking your word and potentially having neighbor problems from here on out?***", "NTA... however if you want to have a say in the type if fence and it proves useful to you then paying half is a neighborly thing to do", "NTA. your garden and his dog, his problem", "Not your dog, not your yard, not your problem. NTA", "NTA. No one can tell you what to do with your property.", "Info: Did you know the bushes were preventing his dog from escaping? And if so, did you notify him you were removing the bushes?\n\nEither way, you're not responsible for paying for the fence. But if you were aware of the situation and didn't notify him, then this goes from N T A to E S H.", "NTA ... wtf ... are we at a point where a person has to justify removing things on \\*their own\\* property because neighbours can't be bothered to take proper care of their pets?\n\nPoor pets I guess...", "YTA - you should have mentioned you were going to remove them, becaue you knew this would be an issue. That way they could have had a chance to solve it.\n\nYou shouldn't have agreed and changed your mind.\n\nYou shouldn't have told him you had changed your mind in a rext and you shouldn't have written it like an asshole.", "YTA for not having the common sense to realize that if you remove the bushes, the dog will get out. You should have given the guy some warning at the very least. Did you even care if the dog could be lost or killed with this new freedom? Jerk.", "An invisible fence like the one my neighbour has would be better, only downside is teenagers are able to hear that frequency (17000 hz)", "I just googled it and a load of states just popped up. It\u2019s called a shared fence law. \n\nI\u2019m pretty sure it originated to avoid shared fence repairs falling on a single party. I\u2019ve had to pay half on repairs at least twice in my life.", "Because if there isn\u2019t a fence there should be. Under law the right to have a fence dividing property exists, the benefits of having a fence go to both parties. If there\u2019s inadequate fencing half needs to be paid.", "Not the neighbors problem to deal with their dog. They can pay for the fence.", "A fence  is usually on the boundary. Both are responsible", "I had one for my dog, they have fail safes for dogs that escape and the collar deactivates after x amount of zaps. Not really harmful.... Bastard dug and jumped my fence, the ole zappy zap zap was my only other option", "Typically teenagers, at 28 I can still hear those things. Drives me crazy", "From what I understand the only fence was the bushes. I have the same sort of deal with my neighbors and tbh I'd be upset if my neighbors riped them all out without even a head up so we could find alternative fencing for my pup. Just because OP has the right to landscape however they please that doesn't mean it wouldn't be nice to give a warning that they need to find a way to keep the dog in", "Yeah but there's no reason to be a jack ass and not tell the neighbor. It would cost you nothing, Infact not doing so could strew over. What happens if OP didn't realize the bushes were actually not on his side of the line?", "Because you are responsible for half your boundary fencing regardless of wanting it, it\u2019s considered a property right and obligation like paying taxes", "Everyone that trains their dog with shock collars is a massive asshole", "That makes no sense. If I don't want a fence, why should I have to pay for someone else's?! My next door neighbors don't have a fence, nor do their neighbors on the other side. We have a fence, and so do the folks behind them. Why the hell should they be responsible for their neighbor's fence, when they clearly don't care to fence in their yard?!", "There's a difference between training your dog with a shock collar and an underground fence. I swear reddit sees buzz words and loses its ability to fucking read.", "NTA, my neighbor took down his fence, and complained, kept running his lawn tractor into our wooden fence we kept up to keep our dogs safe. Our dogs safety is our responsibility, your neighbors dog is your neighbors responsibility.", "NTA for saying you won't pay for the fence, but if you knew the bushes were keeping the dog in YTA for not discussing it with the neighbors before removing the bushes.", "NTA. But the Old saying good fences make goes neighbours definitely  applies. If it's not crazy money and you can afford it,  I'd consider  a 50/50 split myself. It's not very nice being awkward or falling out with a neighbour and if you have to live beside them for years and years then 50/50 split to save your newly landscaped garden might be worth it. Of course you are not obliged to but its hard to put a price on peace and quiet and a good neighbour is priceless.", "NTA - However I don't think your neighbor is crazy for asking you to. I can see where they're coming from. \nBe aware though (at least where I live in Canada) if the fence is built on the property line you are required to pay half. I would check where you live and, if this is the case, work with your neighbors.", "You should look up your local (city/state) laws; where I live you are responsible for half the cost of a boundary fence whether or not you want it there. It varies by location what the rules are\u2014that you have to pay if it\u2019s part of enclosing your own yard, that you have to pay if you have animals on your property, etc etc. so the first thing to do is look it up!\n\nAnd after that NTA. It\u2019s nice they got done free benefit from your bushes but they were on your property and it\u2019s your right to remove them", "NTA his dog his problem", "Exactly this. I get the feeling 99% of the commenters here aren't homeowners, are are reacting based on what they *feel* should be how it works. \n\nThere are a TON of laws governing property lines between neighbors, including: fencing, trees/limbs, driveways, grass/shrubs, etc. \n\nFew of the comments here are useful or correct, and this is one of the few that are spot on.", "Nah, there does not need to be a fence to control a dog.  There are these amazing things called leashes.  The owner of the dog needs to be in control of their pet.  Using the neighbor's bushes is a lazy way to do it.  And only works until said bushes leave.  I am impressed the bushes worked, my dogs would have absolutely found a way through if there was a squirrel involved.   \n\nWhy does OP have to be thinking not just about his property but also the pets of his neighbor?  They are not his dogs, not his problem.  It would have been polite to tell them, but if anything something along the lines of \"hey the bushes are going away next week, FYi, so make sure you keep an eye on your dogs\" would have been more than enough.\n\nAs far as who is responsible for a fence, time to brush up on your local rules and regs.  Some of them don't make sense. \n\nWhen I moved into my current house we had a fenced yard but it was a hodge podge of the surrounding neighbors fences.  All were old and all were 4 feet tall.  I had large strong giant breed dogs.  I had max height fences installed soon after moving in to make sure that the dogs were safe.  It was my expense and responsibility because they were my dogs.", "My next door neighbors don't have a fence, and neither does their neighbor on the other side. We have a fence, as does their neighbor behind them. Why on earth should they have to pay to maintain our fence, or the fence of the folks behind them?! They clearly have no need or desire for a fence. So why should they have any responsibility for it?!", "Depends where you live, as I said in my post. In some countries there's legislation to sort all this out.  I'm pretty sure that in my previous UK home I was responsible for the fence to the left hand side of the back garden.", "What am I talking about?  Wow. I mean, heaven forbid that things might work differently in other places than where you live.  As another poster has already said, that's the law in England.", "I mean, I don't get the impression that OP understood that these bushes were forming a fence for the dog.  He was just doing some landscaping, and, voila!, suddenly his neighbor wants a bunch of money to help put up a fence to keep the neighbor's dog in.\n\n(Again, I'd chat with the neighbors about this for months before I actually got around to it, but I accept that this is not a requirement.)", "Saying I don\u2019t want it is an easy get out of paying for fencing you\u2019re otherwise benefitting from. It\u2019s easier to encode into law 50/50 responsibilities, in a large majority of suburban and regional areas of this world fencing is normal and appropriate for keeping in stock, for pets and privacy, America is an anomaly for not having fencing in suburban areas.", "No matter how you call it, that shit is illegal where I live and that's not without reason", "NTA. His dog, his problem.", "INFO what are on the other sides of your neighbors yard? I\u2019ve never seen a shrub that could contain a dog. What were they? Cactus?", "NTA- but honestly it would have been nice to give the neighbors a heads up. I certainly don\u2019t think your obligated to pay for anything but if you know they rely on the bushes and they\u2019ll need to figure out another boundary, it would be kind to inform them. I\u2019d be pretty irritated if my neighbors took down their portion of fence without simply letting me know, so I could plan accordingly.", "YTA. Depending on the laws in your area, you may or may not be in the clear legally and have every right to do this and refuse to pay for part of the fence, but you had to know that something on the boundary means that your neighbour is affected by it. It's courtesy to tell your neighbour you're going to do something like this so they aren't left scrambling.", "I agree, NTA for saying no, but YTA for saying you'd pay half then backing out, and YTA for not consulting your wife first before committing. That is a two-to-one YTA on this one.", "Tell me you're fond of animal torture without telling me you're fond of animal torture", "I don\u2019t know why you are getting down voted for this. We have two tiny dogs and a huge yard. They love having the electric fence. Each set it off once and never again. They spend hours each day outside.", "Where I live the fence is built in the boundary and both home owners are responsible for the cost of a simple chain link fence. If one home owner wants a more elaborate fence they are responsible for the cost of the elaborate fence -50% of what a chain link fence would cost.", "Because people saw \"shock collar\" and immediately assumed it was the inhumane version. Reading comprehension in the presence of certain words is expecting too much.", "You had many options like a deeper and higher fence or keeping an eye on him while he was outside. You chose animal abuse. Says a lot about you.", "An underground fence that sends a beeping warning to the dog as it starts getting closer and delivers one quick shock when crossed is a lot different than a remote controlled shock collar. We even shocked ourselves with the collar before putting it on the dog to make sure it wasn't insanely high.", "\"An underground fence that shocks a dog is different than a collar that shocks a dog\" LOL\n\nKeep trying to justify shocking your dog, I'm sure that won't make you look like more of an AH.", "Aww, you left out some important words in that sentence. Deliberately misinterpreting what people say must make it very easy to justify your opinions."]}
