Though if that's the route you're going to take you'll probably need to accept your neighbour coming into your yard to retrieve his dog on a semi-regular basis. Personally I'd put up a fence on my side to keep them both out, but you're not obligated to do that if you don't want to.", "NTA. You are exactly right, he was using your plants as a way to keep his dog in, not your problem! If you had trimmed them all the way back, he would have the same issue.", "NTA. He wants to contain his dog to his backyard? Then he pays for the fence.", "NTA\n\nyou aren't obligated to change your landscaping or pay for anything because your neighbor wants you to.", "NTA and your neighbor should know better as a home/pet owner. The responsibility of their dog's behavior is on them, not you or your wife.\n\nYou may want to put a camera in the backyard, though.", "Nah, NTA, maybe you could have warned him you were taking them out beforehand, but you are in no way required to help him keep his dog in his yard. That's his responsibility. And it looks like he came to you for the cost of the fence, not because he was annoyed you hadn't spoken to him about it first.", "NTA his dog, his responsibility. Unless you live in an HOA or there\u2019s a city code requiring the boundaries to have a fence, and the bushes were considered as fencing, you should be able to landscape your property how you like.", "NTA but it was a pretty presumptuous move to agree without talking to your wife. In doing so the neighbors are going to see it as an AH move.", "NTA.  It's their dog, so their responsibility to keep it in their garden.  It was just luck that there was a hedge on your property acting as a fence for a while.  Perhaps you could have given them a heads up first so they could have installed one before, but either way, it's on them to protect their dog, and if the fence is not something you want or need, and is not on your property, then there is no reason you should pay any of it.", "Info: Who is legally responsible for that boundary line?  They should be the ones paying.", "This kinda depends on if there is a fence already there but just not where the bushes were and who actually owns said fence/border because it's their responsibility. I feel like more INFO is needed regarding property line and what else is separating your garden from there's? As I assume there's just a gap where the bushes were and it's not the entire line of the gardens but I may be wrong...", "NTA. His dog, his fence.", "Info: did you tell him before you removed the bushes? Did you know that removing the bushes would cause a gap in the fence line?", "Soft AH because you could have talked to them first, given them a chance to make arrangements to secure their dog. They may not have the money right now for a fence. Technically not your problem, but still a dick move. \n\nBut really, you need to check the property documents to see which one of you is responsible for the fence. One of you will be. This will depend where you live, but I'd be surprised if there isn't something in the property documents.\n\nOnce you know that, you'll have a legal answer rather than an internet judgement.", "Admittedly fence law is very variable but where I am if there\u2019s no fence and one party wants to erect one, as long as it\u2019s a \u201creasonable\u201d fence (ie not excessively fancy or something) both neighbours need to pay 50%.\n\nYTA.", "YTA no research on who might actually own the boundary line, for all you know you might have destroyed your neighbors property.

If you have a problem with their dog in your yard then put up a fence, but if I was them I\u2019d just leave it as is \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f \n\nDon\u2019t complain about the dog though lol", "INFO was the bushes your or your neighbours. Or were the bushes the boundary line.\n\nIt looks like you destroyed commonly owned borderline bushes. If so you would be lucky to get away with paying for a half a new fence.", "I don't know what the rules are where you're from, but here every neighbour has the right to a 2m high fence, costs to be shared between both parties. So your neighbour could demand that a fence be placed on the property line and you would be legally required to pay half.\n\nRegardless of the rules, I would be very upset if my neighbours just took out the boundary between our two yards unannounced and refused to cooperate to restore it. YTA", "INFO\n\nDo you know where the property line is?

It\u2019s hard to believe your neighbor had the nerve to ask you to pay for a fence in the first place!  You have zero obligation to help with the cost of a fence to contain his dog.

Your property, you can do what you like with the trees. \n\nWhere I'm from a fence on the boundary line is a 50/50 responsibility, whether the neighbour wants the fence or not. A fence inside the boundary line is the responsibility of whoever's property it is.\n\nI had a long battle with the neighbours at my parents' house because they refused to go 50/50 on a suitable fence to keep both of our dogs in their respective yards; the original fence was 1.5ft tall and looked like an equestrian show jump obstacle. My dog could walk over it, their dog could walk under it. It got to the point where I sent them a council-supported letter via registered post to create a paper trail that I had tried to negotiate with them. This cued the expected \"Why didn't you just talk to us in person?\" response. \n\nIn the end I got a surveyor out so we could build just inside the property line. Turns out the original fence was actually 1ft into our property. They didn't want to pay the thousands it would cost to buy that 1ft of land off us, so now there's a 6ft fence on the boundary line that was paid for 50/50.", "NTA he should have a fence on his property that keeps his dog in.

Honestly, I\u2019d pay the entire cost of putting a privacy fence between my property and such an entitled neighbor.

No one is responsible for a fence because no one has to have one.  If they or their neighbor want a fence they can each pay to get one on their own property.  It\u2019s not really a legal issue.", "Bs. They don\u2019t have money for a fence, that\u2019s not OPs problem. They can walk their dog around their yard with a leash like alllll the other people that don\u2019t have fence\u2019s, myself included. \n\nOP is not in any way shape or form obligated to consult his neighbors before making changes to his own property (barring circumstances that actually do affect the neighbor such as driving through their yard to reach the back of his property, etc).", "From the post where it quotes OP\u2019s text, the bushes are on OP\u2019s property - not commonly owned", "I think it\u2019s more common that the maintenance of a shared fence to be shared between the owners rather than having to share the price of building new when only one party builds it.", "That is literally the dumbest thing I\u2019ve ever heard. \u201cHey if you don\u2019t want MY dog in YOUR yard, that\u2019s YOUR problem so YOU build MY dog a fence to keep him in MY own yard\u201d.

The pet owner would be responsible for containing their animal on their property", "Only if you both agree. However if one of the owners does not agree then no one can force you to pay 1/2 of a fence. Unless you took down a fence that belonged to the neighbors especially one that on their property. That the determining factor is where the fence was placed and who paid for it. If I put a fence on my property and the neighbor takes it down then I could sue them\nfor the cost of the fence. We own two different properties. One we paid for the fencing we needed to keep our dogs safely enclosed. At the other property one side of the fence went down and then the other fence to the other neighbor went down. Both times we paid for the materials the other neighbors took care of the labor. It just depends on what you and the neighbor agree on.", "I don't think that is true. If my neighbor wants a fence and I don't, why should I pay half?", "It occurs to me there may even be legal consequences for the OP removing the boundary."]}
