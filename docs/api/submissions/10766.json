I (26f) was terrified as my family has had a rough go of miscarriages. I went to the doctor, everything was okay, but we were still only 8 weeks and things go wrong all the time. That night my husband (29m) came home and said Karen (63f; yes, real name) was digging into him at lunch asking if I was pregnant. He played it off and told her no. (Husband and I are teachers in the same building.)  The next day, Karen came into my class and announced my pregnancy after \u201cguessing\u201d and no facts. I told her and my class no, just a routine physical. My 7th graders got awkward and pretended they didn\u2019t hear. She left my room and that evening I ran into her at a local restaurant. She kept asking me why I was avoiding her. I said I was upset and needed space, she didn\u2019t give me space. I warned her that if she asked one more time, I was not going to hold my tongue. She asked. I went on a rant about how inappropriate it was to assume pregnancy for anyone, if I was pregnant, she stole our thunder by starting a rumor, if I wasn\u2019t she started a rumor that could be painful; I could have infertility issues and struggle to conceive or carry a child; I could have found out bad news at the doctor; or I could have even been at the doctor doing biopsies for cancer in short she did not know and should not have dug. She scoffed and said \u201csorry\u201d while walking away. A lady near by came over and hugged me and said she was proud of how I handled myself. I wish more people of the older generation understood boundaries and praised people for sticking up for themselves. \n\nFor the next 4 weeks, she refused to talk to me or my husband, talked trash about a program she helped me for and I implemented to our co-workers, and has acted like a child in any regard around us.\n\nBut I lied to her\u2026 We are 13 weeks today. We announced our pregnancy last week and Karen said she was so excited that she was right and asked if her and I were okay. I said I needed space but she is constantly waving and in my face asking how I feel. I believe she is doing this in hopes I just get over it. But honestly, I don\u2019t know if I have the space to forgive her right now. \n\nSo, am I the asshole for yelling at her in public and lying to her even when she was right?", "created_utc": 1677203858, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11afg4s/aita_for_telling_my_coworker_off_in_a_public/", "score": 854, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

As others have said, you need to take it up the chain. How far up you go (only to the principal? Does it need to go to the superintendent? That type of up the chain) is up to you. Something to consider, since you have mentioned that you do have a family history of miscarriages, would be finding someway to talk about it to your students. They are old enough to understand the differences between miscarriages and abortions, but what they don't understand is the effect that rumors can have and you really don't want a nasty rumor to start in the even the worst happens. Perhaps a letter can be sent home to parents to that effect so that between the school and the parents the rumors could be squashed before they can even start. This could also be a good teaching point that many don't touch on because of the sensitive nature and learning how to be tactful and kind now could go a long way in the future. Just a suggestion, and with everyone working together something \"safe\" could be pulled together, if you feel comfortable enough. While it is your personal medical information and it can be hard to even mention it, don't be afraid to say that due to familial medical history this could be a problem, so be kind. I'll use myself as an example: I drink very little or not at all, and when someone offers, I typically say not now thank you since alcoholism runs in the family from one side and I choose to not risk falling into that trap but maybe in a bit I'll get something. It's actually quite impressive how many people say \"Ok!\" and actually not push the issue whether or not I actually do get the drink that time. Perhaps something similar could work for you. I'm not sure what could be said in your scenario, but that is where working with the parents and perhaps the school's counselor to come up with some sort of lesson to actually teach about this side of pregnancy comes into play. I don't have kids, so I don't know how anything is taught in the schools now, but I do know that if miscarriages were taught during sex ed/biology classes it was more of a mention that it could happen and it was almost treated as a shameful and taboo thing.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
