That night my husband (29m) came home and said a teacher (63f) was digging into him at lunch asking if I was pregnant. He played it off and told her no. (Husband and I are teachers in the same building.)  The next day, Teacher came into my class and announced my pregnancy after \u201cguessing\u201d and no facts. I told her and my class no, just a routine physical. My 7th graders got awkward and pretended they didn\u2019t hear. She left my room and that evening I ran into her at a local restaurant. She kept asking me why I was avoiding her. I said I was upset and needed space, she didn\u2019t give me space. I warned her that if she asked one more time, I was not going to hold my tongue. She asked. I went on a rant about how inappropriate it was to assume pregnancy for anyone, if I was pregnant, she stole our thunder by starting a rumor, if I wasn\u2019t she started a rumor that could be painful; I could have infertility issues and struggle to conceive or carry a child; I could have found out bad news at the doctor; or I could have even been at the doctor doing biopsies for cancer in short she did not know and should not have dug.

As others have said, you need to take it up the chain. How far up you go (only to the principal? Does it need to go to the superintendent? That type of up the chain) is up to you. Something to consider, since you have mentioned that you do have a family history of miscarriages, would be finding someway to talk about it to your students. They are old enough to understand the differences between miscarriages and abortions, but what they don't understand is the effect that rumors can have and you really don't want a nasty rumor to start in the even the worst happens. Perhaps a letter can be sent home to parents to that effect so that between the school and the parents the rumors could be squashed before they can even start. This could also be a good teaching point that many don't touch on because of the sensitive nature and learning how to be tactful and kind now could go a long way in the future. Just a suggestion, and with everyone working together something \"safe\" could be pulled together, if you feel comfortable enough. While it is your personal medical information and it can be hard to even mention it, don't be afraid to say that due to familial medical history this could be a problem, so be kind. I'll use myself as an example: I drink very little or not at all, and when someone offers, I typically say not now thank you since alcoholism runs in the family from one side and I choose to not risk falling into that trap but maybe in a bit I'll get something. It's actually quite impressive how many people say \"Ok!\" and actually not push the issue whether or not I actually do get the drink that time. Perhaps something similar could work for you. I'm not sure what could be said in your scenario, but that is where working with the parents and perhaps the school's counselor to come up with some sort of lesson to actually teach about this side of pregnancy comes into play. I don't have kids, so I don't know how anything is taught in the schools now, but I do know that if miscarriages were taught during sex ed/biology classes it was more of a mention that it could happen and it was almost treated as a shameful and taboo thing.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

The fact that she made it to 63 years old doesn't mean she hasn't been an asshole all her life. I am only 3 years older than her and would never have done what she did. It wouldn't even occur to me that I should announce something I wasn't 100% certain about and wasn't my business to announce.", "That\u2019s what I\u2019m saying. She should know better!

I will take further actions if you don't leave me alone\"", "NTA- you handled it perfectly. You didnt make drama at work. You told her to back off before, when she didnt, explaining why what she did was fucked up. You didnt namecall or throw any low blows. You told her the problem with her behaviour. \n\nI am always so glad to see teachers who are like you. Thank you for your service", "When I was way much younger I had a curse, I knew a woman was pregnant very early in her pregnancy. I also am the infamous person whose social brain is slower than her tongue (autism there). Result, I would look at a friend and exclaim: \"You are pregnant!\". This was done with no malice and my friends understood that and explained how unwelcome it could be. \n\nIf even I with my lack of social clues got it, that colleague should have understood it easily unless she really doesn't care about you. She is just a nosy person who is probably one of the main hubs of rumours about everyone in the school and she wanted to have another juicy news to add to her daily output.  \n\nThose people are the worst, despiteful, narcissist, and enjoying the power it gives them to rule over everyone by passing rumours over them. It is a kind of power to be able to destroy or uphold people reputation and she is getting a high from it. \n\nYou were absolutely right to push back for your right for a healthy boundary.

So maybe 9 weeks? \n  \nI hadn't told anyone yet, and I was glad that I hadn't. Dealing with their sympathies and awkwardness was not something I wanted to have to endure while also dealing with the realization of all my fears.

Walking into your room and announcing to 7th graders no less that you are pregnant is just a dick thing to do. and weird given their ages. Why on earth someone would discuss their teachers pregnancy to (at least where I live) middle schoolers is just beyond baffling. \n\nIt's YOUR pregnancy NOT hers. She took that right from you to decide when to announce and ruined it making an important life decision out of your hands.

The AUDACITY of her inserting herself into your life like that is shocking. \n\nHow empty is her own life that she thought this was at all her business?!?! I would have even said NTA if someone like your own BFF or your Mom did what she did, but a random coworker? JFC. Nothing about that was appropriate on her part. Nothing. \n\nAnd you listed a lot of great reasons why it wasn\u2019t her business, but you missed one. What if you lived a state that is going to try to sue/punish women who access abortion care? She starts a rumor at school that you\u2019re pregnant when you\u2019re not and then the pregnancy doesn\u2019t materialize. What happens when someone reports you to the state as having had an abortion?\n\nShe was so out of line and I\u2019d put it on file with HR.", "Congratulations!

It's enough that there was cause to warrant it.\n\nWho cares if the rest of the staff sees her as the bad guy? She shouldn't have to explain the whole situation to people in order for other people to approve of her decision. \n\nIt's not about them. It's about her. Rational adults understand that some things are not their business.", "She wasn't \"right,\" she was wrong to discuss your private health status with students.

I find it weird that she was under the illusion that any of this was her business.  You are not friends, she is merely an acquaintance by dint of you both working at the same school.  She came into the classroom and started going on about being pregnant in front of the students, so you should not feel bad for calling her out in a public place.

That she did that alone is justification for reporting it.", "No, especially if you emphasize that you and your husband tried to handle it privately with her, and that she has been ignoring your efforts to enforce boundaries with her. \n\nHas your husband had any further confrontations with this woman?

Not even slightly.\n\nBut she clearly saw your earlier conversations as hypothetical situations. You should tell her the truth now. You didn't want to announce your pregnancy early because of a history of miscarriages in your family, meaning you didn't want to have to explain it to kids if the worst happened. She needs to know what a complete and utter asshole she was.", "I will add she is a woman I know through a local sports league we do, not a total stranger.", "Oh my word, I am so sorry!
