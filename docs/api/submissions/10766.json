I (26f) was terrified as my family has had a rough go of miscarriages. I went to the doctor, everything was okay, but we were still only 8 weeks and things go wrong all the time. That night my husband (29m) came home and said a teacher (63f) was digging into him at lunch asking if I was pregnant. He played it off and told her no. (Husband and I are teachers in the same building.)  The next day, Teacher came into my class and announced my pregnancy after \u201cguessing\u201d and no facts. I told her and my class no, just a routine physical. My 7th graders got awkward and pretended they didn\u2019t hear. She left my room and that evening I ran into her at a local restaurant. She kept asking me why I was avoiding her. I said I was upset and needed space, she didn\u2019t give me space. I warned her that if she asked one more time, I was not going to hold my tongue. She asked. I went on a rant about how inappropriate it was to assume pregnancy for anyone, if I was pregnant, she stole our thunder by starting a rumor, if I wasn\u2019t she started a rumor that could be painful; I could have infertility issues and struggle to conceive or carry a child; I could have found out bad news at the doctor; or I could have even been at the doctor doing biopsies for cancer in short she did not know and should not have dug. She scoffed and said \u201csorry\u201d while walking away. A lady near by came over and hugged me and said she was proud of how I handled myself. I wish more people of the older generation understood boundaries and praised people for sticking up for themselves. \n\nFor the next 4 weeks, she refused to talk to me or my husband, talked trash about a program she helped me for and I implemented to our co-workers, and has acted like a child in any regard around us.\n\nBut I lied to her\u2026 We are 13 weeks today. We announced our pregnancy last week and Teacher said she was so excited that she was right and asked if her and I were okay. I said I needed space but she is constantly waving and in my face asking how I feel. I believe she is doing this in hopes I just get over it.

As others have said, you need to take it up the chain. How far up you go (only to the principal? Does it need to go to the superintendent? That type of up the chain) is up to you. Something to consider, since you have mentioned that you do have a family history of miscarriages, would be finding someway to talk about it to your students. They are old enough to understand the differences between miscarriages and abortions, but what they don't understand is the effect that rumors can have and you really don't want a nasty rumor to start in the even the worst happens. Perhaps a letter can be sent home to parents to that effect so that between the school and the parents the rumors could be squashed before they can even start. This could also be a good teaching point that many don't touch on because of the sensitive nature and learning how to be tactful and kind now could go a long way in the future. Just a suggestion, and with everyone working together something \"safe\" could be pulled together, if you feel comfortable enough. While it is your personal medical information and it can be hard to even mention it, don't be afraid to say that due to familial medical history this could be a problem, so be kind. I'll use myself as an example: I drink very little or not at all, and when someone offers, I typically say not now thank you since alcoholism runs in the family from one side and I choose to not risk falling into that trap but maybe in a bit I'll get something. It's actually quite impressive how many people say \"Ok!\" and actually not push the issue whether or not I actually do get the drink that time. Perhaps something similar could work for you. I'm not sure what could be said in your scenario, but that is where working with the parents and perhaps the school's counselor to come up with some sort of lesson to actually teach about this side of pregnancy comes into play. I don't have kids, so I don't know how anything is taught in the schools now, but I do know that if miscarriages were taught during sex ed/biology classes it was more of a mention that it could happen and it was almost treated as a shameful and taboo thing.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You went easy on her. She invaded your privacy, and took it upon herself to gossip about your body. She would be dead to me.", "NTA. She was disclosing private medical information without your consent, and you had every right to tear a strip off of her", "NTA\n\nI thought it was VERY common decency that you NEVER ask if someone is pregnant. Apparently this lady really missed the memo!", "NTA. And I think you need to go to HR and/or your superiors about this, because it's affecting your work, and her harassment is causing you stress that is bad for your health. You want this officially documented, because she seems like the type to retaliate by continuing to tell lies about you, and generally whoever reports first is more likely to be believed.\n\nETA: Specifically, you need to tell HR that she announced confidential medical information about which she had no actual knowledge to your class of children, and that when you told her that was not okay, she retaliated against you by refusing to confer with you or your husband on work-related matters and by spreading false negative rumors about a school program you're involved in. Tell them that you consider her continued behavior to be pregnancy discrimination, and that you are asking for protection from the continued stress of her hostile actions.", "NTA even a little bit. I had a coworker take it upon herself to start telling customers that I was pregnant the day I announced to my colleagues, and I was livid. Can\u2019t imagine what my reaction would have been if I\u2019d been in your situation.", "NTA\n\nYou should have reported her right away because what she did was very inappriorate and rude.  She basically invaded your privacy.  You still can go and tell the principal or BOE because she may do the same to others, you never know.", "NTA\nYou should cut her out", "NTA- privacy matters.", "Next time she asks how you feel, ask her why she wants to know because she'll tell people what she wants to anyway whether it's her business or not.", "NTA and you don't have to forgive her. Tell her to back off and leave you alone or HR will have to get involved. She sounds like a lunatic.", "I know that when you read posts on reddit you generally have to go with the all of this totally happened and 100% true but the stranger at the restaurant hugged me has real strong \"And everyone clapped and they gave me a  key to the city\" energy. NTA if this is all true btw and im sorry you had to go through that.  \nReport her to HR because that has to be violating so many rules.", "NTA.  I'm a former teacher, so I know how kids and schools are.  Everything you said was spot on.  YOU didn't approach HER in the restaurant, SHE approached YOU.  She was out of line from the very first time she approached your husband about it.  I'm glad that woman gave you a hug!  I would have given you one as well.\n\nI taught with a woman who apparently conceived on one of the last couple of days before her husband deployed to Iraq.  She actually thought she was \"late\" due to stress.  Once she found out she was pregnant, she couldn't get in contact with DH to share the news.  She didn't have family in the area (they were waiting for their house to sell to move to our area) and she didn't want to get their hopes up in case something went wrong.  She trusted me enough to tell me before anyone else (once she knew she couldn't reach DH).  I said absolutely nothing about it to anyone.  Not even when I had to drive her to the ER because she was spotting.  I got her home just in time to run back to my apartment, shower, change, and make it to work.  Everyone thought I was coming down with something.  I didn't correct their assumption because I wasn't going to betray my friend's secret.  Friend was fine.  People eventually guessed why I was exhausted that day after my friend mentioned she'd had some problems early on and she was glad I was able to help.", "NTA....you are right that coworker was wrong and you were right to set them straight on it. But your coworkers actions and reactions had nothing to do with the older generation not understanding boundaries. She is just wrong. No need to generalize negatively about an entire group of people because you are unhappy with one person. Younger people sure take offense when some boomer says disparaging things about all millennials. Generalizations are almost always wrong and are often hurtful.", "NTA and honestly f that woman, I wouldn't even entertain letting that woman close to me again, that's such a shitty thing to do and she obviously has no concept that it's shitty.", "BTW, Congrats on your pregnancy! And best of luck.", "It's not a grudge, it's a boundary. Don't feel bad about maintaining it.\n\nShe isn't a safe person for your emotions. Keep her out.", "Don't think anyone would blame you for holding a grudge in this situation. Your co-worker had no right to do that. I agree with those who said that you need to report her.", "Why haven\u2019t you reported this behavior yet??", "NTA. Well worded response to old lady nosiness! \nCongrats on your baby bump! Woohoo!", "Sounds like she needs an early retirement then. She doesn\u2019t have any right to be spreading rumors like that and if she\u2019s this brazen about it then it\u2019s definitely happened before. If you make a complaint make sure to use strong language, not cursing but if you point out it\u2019s creating a hostile work environment that should send up red flags to the people you need to complain to, even if they only recognize it because they could get sued for that.", "You go up to him and say, \u201cI actually misrepresented the situation between me and teacher because I was more focused on my pregnancy after a difficult history, but this is still weighing on me and I need more concrete action taken to prevent this in the future, especially as my attempts to get some space from teacher are falling on deaf ears without any administrative intervention.\u201d And then, be very polite, but very firm. Specifically use the words, \u201ctried to share private medical information, made me incredibly uncomfortable in front of the children, corned both myself and my husband, and hasnt been respecting my request for space from the issue.\u201d Do not minimize. Tell the principal exactly what you said to the teacher\u2014 that was uncalled for. I could\u2019ve been going in for a miscarriage, especially as I\u2019ve had them before, not that it\u2019s anyone\u2019s business (if you\u2019re comfortable sharing, otherwise don\u2019t), I could\u2019ve had a cancer scare or even a diagnosis or I could\u2019ve found out I was infertile. Or, it could\u2019ve been absolutely nothing. Either way, trying to start that sort of drama in front of kids is unprofessional, not to mention a MAJOR violation of my medical privacy.", "File a formal report. Harassment, unprofessional behavior, whatever. This woman's behavior falls under many categories.", "I think you are an excellent teacher and downright impressive for turning this personal emotional situation into a very important lesson for your students.", "This. OP, your coworker is engaging in gender-based harassment and is discussing your medical concerns with the children in your class. It is 10000% inappropriate and your HR or your union need to be told what\u2019s going on so they can read her the riot act.", "YOU did not,  and will not be, the one causing the drama!!!!!! This isn't on you! Wish I could hug you.  Don't feel badly about telling your truth!\n\nNTA!", "Even if she were in a position where it HIPAA would apply, it's only a violation if she came by the information through her organization. Guessing based on circumstantial evidence and being nosey AF doesn't count, as wildly inappropriate as it is.", "Just be careful throwing the term \"hostile work environment\" around, as that's a specific legal term that doesn't always line up with how a layperson would understand it. It has to be based in a protected class. This probably would count since it has to do with whether or not you're pregnant (hence being gender based because cis men can't get pregnant), but it's something to keep in mind for future work place issues."]}
