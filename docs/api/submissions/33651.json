And you never spoke to your son about anything to do with values, how to treat others, etc? Where are you expecting his moral compass to come from? You are his parent. Parent him.\n\nBut good for you for standing up to your horrible wife and family. If your family is very religious, shouldn't they be against bullying and physical aggression? Don't let hypocritical people confuse you. You want your son to grow up to be a good person. If that isn't what they want, I don't know what this religion could be.\n\nI'm between N.T.A and E.S.H. but at least you are trying to take a stand and do some real parenting, which is what will help your son be able to have actual relationships and function in the adult world, so for now - NTA.\n\nEdit:typo", "ESH.  Your son\u2019s behavior is awful and I won\u2019t give him a pass on it.  But it also sounds like you have abdicated responsibility for an important part of parenting over the years, and even now are taking the easy way out by just imposing a draconian punishment that isn\u2019t going to teach him anything and will only drive him away from you and back to the negative influences.\n\nAs a parent, you should have been teaching him values all along.  You should have been discussing politics in an age-appropriate way so he develops a good understanding of issues like racism and gay rights.  By not doing your job as a parent, you left a vacuum for his mother and social media personalities to fill.  So you may not have taught him these awful beliefs, but you had a role in their development.  \n\nAnd what he needs now is not the lazy approach of taking away his social media access (but realistically, only when he\u2019s at your house).  But you\u2019re not actually teaching him anything to counterbalance what he\u2019s learning elsewhere.", "ESH. Sounds like you neglected your son for years. The fact that you have a baby and a job doesn't justify the fact that you didn't spend more time getting to know your son. And how the heck did you not know your wife was like that? You were a lazy parent for years as far as your son was concerned and now he's grown up to be an asshole since you didn't bother to teach him any positive values.", "ESH, your son and wife for obvious reasons, you're not TAH cor punishing him, but for not having any idea that your wife thought these things or was teaching your son them, and not talking to him at all about these important matters while he was growing up. You let him become this racist and homophobic person while you sat back and ignored it.", "Start talking to you son about these things. If you don't teach them, someone else will.", "Your first problem here is that you\u2019ve married a racist and homophobic woman and you haven\u2019t gotten onto the same page about discussing the values you actively want to instil in your children. This is going to be the most difficult part to address. \n\nYou\u2019re not necessarily an asshole for punishing your son, but what you also need to understand is that arbitrary punishments like removing video games and tv, and grounding him will do absolutely nothing to teach him the compassion, kindness and respect you want him to develop. These are punitive measures, not educative. In fact, they may push him even further into that world as he may feel further isolated from you and could develop resentment due to these punishments being so disconnected from the issue at hand. \n\nIf you want your son to become a respectful and inclusive person, you AND YOUR WIFE need to teach him those values explicitly, demonstrate them yourselves and talk about issues in the world. Not talk about politics leaves him wide open to other influences outside your family. It\u2019s like teaching your teenagers about sex. Never discussing it won\u2019t encourage them to abstain. \n\nAs someone who works with teenage boys on these issues, I also just wanted to add that the research around male teens and the alpha male influencers on socials etc show that boys are yearning for strong, positive male role models who portray a positive narrative around what it is to be a man. If a boy has this is his life, he\u2019s much less likely to be susceptible to these influencers. \n\nWishing you and your family all the best. You\u2019re not the asshole and you want your son to have the right values, but it seems to me that some reflection, discussion and education is necessary here for the whole family.", "So to be clear:\n\nYour former wife is a homophobic racist. Your current wife is a homophobic racist.  Your family are homophobic racists. And you are shocked that in your lack of attention, your son has turned into a homophobic racist?\n\nESH", "YTA, but not for punishing your child. It\u2019s a little late, but speak up for justice now\u2014or you\u2019re one of them.", "This goes beyond grounding. Internet addiction is a serious threat for impressionable high schoolers. If you\u2019re able to spend some extra time with him, I would get both of yourselves involved in community work so he can meet a diverse array of people. Do you have something called Air Cadets or Navy Cadets where you\u2019re from? My brother did that when he was in high school and he got to meet all kinds of people outside of our Catholic school community and most of the overnight activities were either free or were partially subsidized.\n\nFrom my experiences, children that young who resort to spewing hate and bullying behaviour are themselves struggling with something. If you have insurance, it might also be worth looking into a therapist.", "I don't think this is real.\n\nThis sounds like it was written by a 13 year old.", "ESH. you should\u2019ve paid more attention to your son as he was growing up. Knowing that your family is racist and homophobic, maybe discuss how these views are problematic. But you\u2019re not wrong for punishing him. He would think what he did was okay if you didn\u2019t.", "NTA But you sure as hell will be if you don't go nuclear on your racist homophobic wife and family.  This is seek legal consul, therapy, and get the hell our of there territory.\n\nShe is going to turn your children into hate filled racists and bigots.  Is that what you want?\n\nRun like your pants are on fire as soon as possible for both you and your children's sake as your resolve is already wavering.", "I always love the phrase \u201ctad racist\u201d. When someone\u2019s a \u201ctad racist\u201d towards me, I get a tad angry and hurt. And when I retaliate back, I just give them a \u201ctad slap\u201d for their \u201ctad racism\u201d. Racist is racist. POC had to settle for the term \u201cmicro-aggression\u201d because others couldn\u2019t handle \u201caggression\u201d as a stand alone word. Which is ironic, cause those committing \u201cmicro-aggressions\u201d are often the folks who are quick to say someone defending themselves verbally is \u201caggressive\u201d. Mmmm hmmmm\n\nI will say, it\u2019s in that you didn\u2019t know. Your privilege allowed you to ignore it or not look at it. People don\u2019t wake up and become racist or homophobic. It\u2019s a very beautiful journey. \n\nIm queer, a person of colour, and melanated. It\u2019s important to call that out as we all know, the darker the skin the more hate we receive. I can tell you this, I lost 5 years of high school, I was shamed on so many fronts, and so embarrassed that I never went to my parents (I don\u2019t blame them, I blame those who did it to me without repercussion). I had to repeat my final year in order to barely graduate, my marks declined year over year, while my mother was a principal and my sister was achieving A\u2019s. You taking away your sons electronics is shit. Him staying home for 8 months is shit! Why, because the kids he impacted are NEVER getting that time back, they have not forgotten the hate that was spewed from his mouth and encouraged by your spouse and quite honestly, your religion.\n\nYou need to take your son to each of those children\u2019s homes. When my mom found out, she dragged me to every single fucking house, told the parents to bring their kids outside and told them they come near me again, they\u2019ll be hearing more than just her words. She told each of them to apologize or she would have them expelled! It stopped. And you know why she came to find out, after 5 years of this, I cracked. I chased 4 guys and I got sent to the office for losing control of myself as a result of words! \n\nYour son did this to those kids! Your family did this to those kids! You don\u2019t get to say \u201ctad racist\u201d. You don\u2019t get to say \u201cit\u2019s my wife and kid\u201d.  \n\nYou\u2019re the asshole for not punishing your son justly. But embarrassing and shaming him the way he and his friends have done to god knows how many innocent kids and their families. To damaging them and treating them with violence! He has no TV and gets to sit in his room after school. Ya, I went to therapy and self defence after school. \n\nGo pray to God, that\u2019ll likely repair the damage he\u2019s done.", "ESH. How could you be so unaware of your family?\nYou have a lot of conversation to catch up on with your son to help guide him as he is forming his ideology. Punishment alone won't work, nor will pushing your own ideas on him. Make sure you communicate the 'why' to your beliefs.", "There are influences everywhere, you must realize that your decision to 'never bring up politics around him' is closely related to how he developed.\n\nGetting rid of his video games and tv is a weird punishment, disconnected from what you think he did wrong and not useful for making him understand. For that misstep and a drought of parenting on your part, I'm saying YTA. But you can still try to teach him and get him away from those influences. You aren't an asshole for trying to do that.", "You are the asshole... because you didn't raise your son. \n\nYou gave every excuse why you didn't see how he became the person he is now. But the only reason that could happen is because you were not there to guild him to become a good person. You failed to teach him morals and values. You left that to his mother, tiktok, podcasts etc. You failed to raise your son. \n\nThe punishement you gave him was deserved. Now what are you going to do to change the trajectory of your son's life? \n\nRight now he's becoming a hateful person, because you are not showing him a better path. \n\nYou have to step up as a parent.", "No, lessons must be taught from early.", "ESH", "Probably should have done some parenting. If your family is Christian, ask them where in the bible \"Love thy neighbor\" had \"except if they're immigrants or gay or anything but white and hetero\", because that's not in the bible. \"Love the sinner\" is also in there somewhere. Judgment is left for God and it's not their business.  By making it their business they're actually going against the word of God.", "YTA until you divorce your wife", "Sounds like your surrounded my assholes", "Yea um his mom is the AH", "NTA.  \n\nAnd your wife and your family sound very religious.  \ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4c", "I think I just witnessed a panic attack in written form. \n\nNTA for giving him consequences, but you're going to have to get him out of the friend group that allowed it to begin with.

You should be monitoring what crap he\u2019s looking at online.", "Sadly, a close scenario happened within my family, but not with a good result. My brother was liberal and his wife conservative. At first, it didn't seem like a big deal. They had a nasty divorce because she wanted to be a SAHM and he couldn't afford that. So she cheated her way into it. Yeah, I know. Conservative values.\n\nTheir three kids spend every other weekend with my brother. Ex-SIL moved them to a more conservative part of the state. Long story short, she became a rabid MAGA and so did my nephew. I think he's even worse than her. He cut off contact with our side of the family because we're too liberal. I'm over it and have no desire to see the little sh!t. His \"values\" are appalling: racist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic, all the phobs.

You're not an AH for freaking out about this, but you kinda neglected your son's education, so you have as much responsibility as mom here for his actions and lack of values. That being said, I don't think taking away his video games is going to solve the problem, which is that he's racist, homophobic and a bully. You really need to take serious action and properly educate him about this stuff before it's too late. Taking away stuff from him will only result in him resenting you ('cause he probably doesn't understand that he's wrong if mom is enabling this behavior) and reinforcing the real problem. \n\nMom is most def the AH tho.", "NTA\n\nYou're doing your job as a responsible parent and showing him there are repercussions for his actions.
