Your reasoning for not splitting something is that he's being petty, but aren't you being petty too? You don't want his child with another woman using the stuff, so you'd rather your child with another man use it. Is it worth causing office drama just to keep him from getting a share? Splitting it is very reasonable and you should get it over with so you can both move on.", "If I were his new gf, I\u2019d be sooo embarrassed knowing he was bothering his ex about splitting the baby stuff that THEY bought together for OUR baby. He left those things with YOU when he left. He doesn\u2019t get to randomly come back like 4 months later and bombard you with guilt for not splitting items that he didn\u2019t give af about. like, he not only left you, but also intentionally wanted to hurt you by throwing in that asshole bullshit about \u201cnever actually wanting kids with you\u201d, so I wouldn\u2019t even continue communicating with him at this point about anything that isn\u2019t strictly work related. \n\nLike, is he gonna bother you everytime he remembers something useful that he may have bought or that you split on during the time you were together?? Did he also ask you to return any passed Valentine\u2019s Day gifts to give his new girl yesterday too?? Like, what a loser. You don\u2019t even owe him an answer let alone giving him half of that baby stuff.", "ESH you are both acting like children when you are both about to bring children into the world. If he paid for half then give half, and move on with this person that you have no ties to anymore.", "INFO\n\n>The situation is a bit messy since we work together and I slept with our mutual friend, Nate, after our breakup. I\u2019m 17 weeks pregnant with Nate\u2019s baby\n\nSo you've been broken up for at least four months and he's only now coming for you for money?\n\nDepending on where you live, if it's been more than 30 days since you left property behind, you don't really have claim to it anymore. \n\nIs the only reason he wants the money now because his girlfriend is pregnant? Did he not care when you first broke up?", "Light ESH. \n\nThis situation sucks. \n\nMy advice to you is to give him some cash to pay for his half of the stuff, but keep the stuff itself. You probably aren't morally OBLIGATED to do that, but it should shut him up at work, make you look like the bigger person, and let you keep all the stuff you picked out without having to imagine him and his new kid wearing it or using it.", "well wouldn't it be easier to just split it and get it over with? why put yourself through that at work?", "ESH here for a multitude of reasons but you shouldn\u2019t have to give anything back.

Assuming nothing wild like thousands of dollars worth of goods or heirlooms.", "NTA. \n\nYour ex wants things he got when he was trying to make a family with you and went back on it, then makes a family with a woman I assume he cheated on you with, and now wants those items for himself. \n\nI do think it was a little shitty to sleep with a mutual friend after the breakup, but your ex is far worse than that. \n\nEdit: My original judgement was ESH (ex for demanding things, op for sleeping with a mutual friend) but after a conversation with another redditor I\u2019ve decided to change it.", "ESH\n\nYou're both acting like children. And you're about to HAVE CHILDREN!!! Grow up and act like mature, responsible parents to be.\n\nYou want to stop being the office gossip?

Grow up and give him half of the items since he helped pay for them.", "NTA.\n\nHonestly, under different circumstances I\u2018d say it\u2018s fair to split them, but he *clearly* only wants to pick on you and make your life more difficult.\n\nHe doesn\u2019t want children and he doesn\u2019t need the stuff.
