We get along, but recently he has not been pulling his weight. I don\u2019t do many chores, he does, but then again I don\u2019t make much of a mess.\nThis month, he did not pay his rent. I pay it, and he usually sends me the money to pay me back. I paid for the entire thing and it has been two nights since it was due. I have a better job than him, but he should still have his rent money due instead of spending it on games and other stuff.\nLast night, while he was out, I locked the door. Although he has a key, we have a second lock that locks from the inside that we put on at night when both of us are home. I locked the door with the second lock so he could not get in. He knocked for about an hour straight, then seemed to leave. I got a ton of text messages calling me names, saying I was selfish, and that I know he doesn\u2019t get paid for another week. I told him that he shouldn\u2019t spend all his money on eating out and other stuff that isn\u2019t necessary, and he left me on read.\nThis morning I unlocked the door, he came inside and said he was moving out back to his parents\u2019 house.\nAITA for locking him out when he didn\u2019t pay his rent on time?\n\nEdit: He hasn\u2019t missed before but he has a history of not paying me back for other things. I mentioned the rent to him and he said he\u2019s \u201cget to it,\u201d then went out with his friends.

Second doesn't even sound like you talked to him about it and just locked him out. Third is most important, you did this at night without knowing he had some where else to go.  That's not just being an AH that's evil", "YTA. You can't lock somebody out of their home for being 2 days late on rent. That's illegal. Are you seriously suggesting someone should be made homeless, even temporarily, for being 2 days late on rent?\n\nIt's not as though his non-payment even put your housing situation in danger; you were just being a petty AH. I'd move out, too, if I couldn't depend on my OWN HOME being open to me.", "Ok, so he was TWO NIGHTS late and he hasn\u2019t missed rent before? And you lock him out? \n\nMost states require a three day notice to pay or quit before the landlord can even start the eviction process. What you did was probably illegal, not to mention wildly irrational. \n\nI\u2019ma go out on a limb and guess that you don\u2019t pay your own rent, your parents send you a check that covers housing and allowance. Nobody who pays their own bills would act with this extreme disregard for someone who is two days behind. \n\nIf your roommate sees this I\u2019m happy to find a good lawyer for them. You\u2019re just wildly awful at being a human.", "YTA. It was a pretty immature move to lock him out rather than communicating with him about the issue. Yeah, he needs to be mature enough to pay his rent on time, but I think you both could have avoided some issues by just talking to one another.", "YTA ever terrible landlords need to give notice to do crap like this", "Can't wait until he gets home before you one night.\n\nYTA.", "YTA.  \n\n\nSo, instead of ...you know... ***COMMUNICATING*** with him... you just arbitrarily lock him out?    \n\n\nWow dude.  Two days?   There are way better and more mature ways to deal with this than that.", "YTA: That is an unlawful eviction. If he isn't paying rent you have to speak with them about it and understand why. Even then you have to give them notice, usually 30 days, before locking them out. Different states and cities have different rules on how to go about kicking out a roommate, and randomly locking them out one day is definitely not one of them. You are lucky he didn't call the police.", "YTA \u2026 enjoy paying all the rent now.", "YTA: Not because of the contents of this story, but based on your post history to your account, it\u2019s only a matter of time before this gets taken down for being a repost.", "YTA, I get the frustration of having a roommate being late on rent. But there are a 100 different ways it could have been handled.", "YTA majorly. That\u2019s his home too- and if he doesn\u2019t pay there are legal paths to handle it already established in society.", "You are literally admitting to criminal actions on the Internet. YTA.", "YTA. Adult communicate their problems. You are not the landlord and are not allowed to deny your roommate access to the apartment.", "Major YTA. This isn\u2019t legal and you obviously didn\u2019t even attempt a conversation with him like a grown up.", "You are. Rent was due two days ago? And you\u2019re acting like this? Locking him out which is illegal? And throwing judgments at him? You\u2019ve screwed yourself out of this months rent I guess. Because if I were him I wouldn\u2019t pay it.

Better hope none of his friends are preLaw or you might find yourself in court.  I love kharma", "Some people must be straight up sociopaths. What the hell- how could one possibly not see how fucked up this is and have the audacity to go on reddit asking AITA? That\u2019s just crazy I would seriously suggest you seek therapy as I cannot imagine you could function normally in modern society if you think doing something like this would be acceptable in any case. The red flag was already there when you said \"He does chores, I don\u2019t but I also don\u2019t make a mess\" .. that\u2019s already problematic enough but I wasn\u2019t prepared for what was to come.. get help OP", "YTA \ud83d\udcaf he should of called the police on you for illegally locking him out.", "Not only are YTA, but your roommate might have a case to seek legal action against you for this.", "YTA.  Now you get to pay all the rent yourself every month.  Great job. /s/", "YTA and could be sued for an illegal eviction. If someone doesn\u2019t pay rent then a legal process has to be followed to kick them out. You can sue him in small claims court for the rent he didn\u2019t pay.", "YTA. By now you should know that was highly illegal.", "YTA. You\u2019ve lived together for 2 years and this is the first time he\u2019s ever been late on rent, and your first reaction is to lock him out of his own home? I don\u2019t blame him for moving out after you pulled an AH stunt like that. \nAlso info: what \u2018other things\u2019 did he not pay you back for?", "Obvious YTA. Jfc", "Yeah, ESH. When you're waiting for half the rent, nonchalance is infuriating and when you're owed money in other ways it makes it hard to believe that you will get it. He hasn't paid you back for other things, and that sucks.\n\nHowever.\n\nBig however.\n\nYou can't just lock someone out when they're two days late. You need to communicate with people; you share a home, after all. If he pays the rent reliably and always has, this is unreasonable, immature and illegal. \n\nHe's also - in your own words - doing chores and contributing around the house, so other than this, how is he not pulling his weight? You said he's never not paid the rent.\n\nI'd move out too.", "Yta...you both must be young though. I'm assuming.  I'm hoping.\nYou both sound like you have growing up to do", "This is super not legal. I really understand your frustration, he does seem irresponsible and I understand that not being paid back for rent can cause you some financial strain. In this case, the best option would be for your roommate to start paying your landlord directly (instead of reimbursing you) if they are on the lease. This way the landlord can deal with the late rent and take appropriate (and legal) action if they desire. If your roommate is not on the lease and they sub-lease from you, you must follow appropriate Landlord and Tenant Board laws for eviction which includes serving the appropriate forms. Many Landlord and Tenant boards are very lenient on tenants and refuse to grant an eviction if the tenant does keep up with a repayment plan or repays all rent owed by an eviction hearing date (which can take months!)- so 2 days late on rent is really negligible.", "Big YTA.", "YTA. That was petty. Grow up and discuss things.", "YTA. You (as far as the information we have states) never said \u201cpay me back right this instant or I\u2019ll lock you out tonight.\u201d We only have your word to go by that he squandered his money on unnecessary things, for all we know he buys the groceries and pays the utility bills. You state he\u2019s never been late paying rent before, so it\u2019s not like this was a long time coming or anything. \n\nYou\u2019re just being a petty b. I\u2019d expect this from a 17-19 year old but my dude, with all due respect, grow up.", "YTA. You've been living together for two years, he never missed rent, does most of the chores and two days of being late you lock him out?. Think about it. That was such an awfully mean thing to do.", "Yta! You locked him out without warning! Wth is wrong with you! Not only is that an AH move its illegal in most places.", "YTA. You know it. You\u2019re being self indulgent.", "YTA. You\u2019re also short-sighted. I would be stunned if he actually paid you the rent now.", "YTA pretty sure that's illegal", "YTA. Who the fuck are you to lock someone out of their own home? I hope he calls the cops on your ass.", "YTA. What was your reasoning behind this? That he would pay you rent overnight? Hopefully he does move out cause you\u2019re weird af.", "YTA. What you did was illegal", "YTA.  Sounds like he should have called the police non emergency number and the landlord.", "YTA and you better hope he doesnt decide to take you to court because what you did was very much against his rights.", "YTA. You not only did not communicate how you were feeling to him but you endangered his life by having him spend the night outside of the house. You should\u2019ve asked him when he looked like he was going to have the rent money and go from there. Now you\u2019re gonna be stuck paying it all by yourself. AND it\u2019s not like he doesn\u2019t contribute to the house at all. You said he does most of the chores.", "MASSIVE YTA. You suck", "YTA. It's his house too. If you have concerns about payments, take it to the courts.", "YTA. He should have just called the police. What you did was illegal.", "YTA\n\nYou're lucky he didn't call the cops you... jeez.\nIt's perfectly valid he wants to move out, so have fun paying the full rent from now on.", "YTA. You are not the landlord, and have no legal right to prevent someone from accessing their lawful residence. Also\u2026this seems like a fairly extreme action to take without first having a complete conversation with your roommate about the late rent and his timeline for paying. It sounds like this relationship isn\u2019t working. Move out or don\u2019t renew your lease with this person.", "Clearly YTA.\n\nSounds like you're more frustrated with The fact he buys video games. But honestly as long as you get your money back that invites a couple days late. It's not your business what he buys. You are not his financial adviser you are not his account and you are not his parent.", "Yeah, you're YTA.  You're not the fucking landlord.  And stop paying for him.  Go to the landlord and tell them instead of covering his ass.  Oh and wow, he does most of the housework too.", "YTA and immature.", "YTA how freaking dare you. You had no right to lock him out. What makes you think that is okay?", "INFO: Are you the landlord, or just a fellow tenant?", "ESH. He definitely should've been paying his rent, but you should try communicating before resorting to locking him out", "YTA\n\nHe was late with rent for two whole days, and you already thought that was way too long and locked him out of his home? Way to show some basic sympathy to any human, let alone the person you've been living with for the last two years.\nThe chore situation and the \"I have a better job than him\" thing are irrelevant to this.", "ESH\n\nYou far more so, though. You locked him out of his own house.\n\nUse your words. Talk to each other. Sort it out. Don\u2019t just decide he should know better and lock him out of his own house.\n\nAnd do your own chores.", "Let him move out", "ESH. He lives there. Whether he's paid his portion of the rent to you or not is immaterial. He is legally entitled to access his lodgings, full stop. If that had been me, the cops would have been involved.\n\nIs he being a chud for not having his half of the rent, or otherwise being financially responsible? Sure, but obviously this is a known issue, and does not rise to the level of being rendered homeless (even for a night) by a roommate, and neither does it give you licence to lecture him about how he spends his money.\n\nAnd now you're on the hook for full rent. Well done.", "Yet another ESH situation that everyone's confused on! Yes YTA for locking him out That's illegal! You should have just not paid his part of the rent.\n\nHowever he's also the AH! He should have saved his money from his last paycheck to pay his rent not expected you to cover it for an extra week till he gets paid again! However even the landlord wouldn't have locked him out if he didn't pay his part! \n\nYou both suck and you shouldn't live together!", "NTA. Do people not understand that you paid his portion of the rent with YOUR money and he didn\u2019t pay you back? Idc if what you did was illegal, he shouldn\u2019t mess with your money, esp if he\u2019s not paid you back for stuff previously. Take this as a lesson to never pay for anyone\u2019s rent again, though.", "Seems like it could have been a conversation before locking him out. \n\nESH", "Everyone, I did talk to him about it. He then chose to go out and spend money with his friends instead of saving up for rent.", "NTA but where I live it\u2019s illegal to lock someone out of their home, even if they haven\u2019t paid their rent, without first going through the proper legal channels.", "Idk I find it hard to say YTA. A lot of people in the comments must just have a lot of money laying around to condone a roommate choosing not to pay their share of the rent. It\u2019s not like she\u2019s the landlord and this is just an investment property, if she didn\u2019t cover his half they both could have ended up homeless! It\u2019s not fair to her to be expected to cover his half of the rent with no problems, no warning, and no thanks. Locking him out might have been a bit much but to know that you owe your roommate for covering your part of rent (and for other things apparently) and then wasting your money to go out and buy unnecessary things before paying them back? He shouldn\u2019t be using her like this. 2 days is a long time to ignore the fact that you didn\u2019t pay your rent and now your roommate is out at least a couple hundred dollars if not more! Saying OP needs to be the one to communicate with him is absurd, he needs to focus on paying her back and getting his priorities right.", "[deleted]", "yta. you're not the landlord. you can't just lock him out like that. I don't care about his history of not paying back, although that would've been a good indicator NOT to be roommates with someone. So you have a history of not making good choices.", "Talk about the nuclear option. Did you try talking to him first? Or was that too radical? YTA", "Yta. Once he moves out, you will have to pay all the rent all the time until you find someone else to move in.", "YTA and this is illegal. He\u2019s a couple days late and you\u2019re treating him like shit? That\u2019s fucking wild ma\u2019am. Like this is so horrible I wish it were fake", "YTA what you did is illegal. Your grievances need to be solved through court.\n\nIn my area, actual landlords often give a 5 day grace period before issuing a 10 day notice. You flew off the handle.", "Soooo he's never been late on rent and you also knew he'd be getting paid the following week.\n\nI get that this was shitty of him but locking him out sounds like a last resort move, it was weird to use it as your *first* resort.\n\nI would be irate too tbh but your move solved *nothing*.", "op=YTA\n\ntwo days late--even the landlord can't lock him out at that point.  They can charge him a late fee--and so can you if you wish,  but locking him out NO.\n\nHope you enjoy paying the rent by yourself until you can find a new roommate who'll clean the apartment and pay rent on time(which he's done according to you every time before this time for TWO YEARS).", "YTA goddamn have you ever learned not to burn bridges? You had no legal basis for this and I hope he sues you for intentional infliction of emotion distress~", "YTA, how do you not see that?", "Two days late and you lock him out instead of talking to him about it? YTA, and also a criminal.

You're super lucky they didn't call the cops", "YTA and a huge douchbag.", "Yeah YTA on a massive scale! Congratulations on being the most immature person and biggest ahole I\u2019ve seen on here all weekend\u2026 I really hope he moves out for good.

This is his home too, and you are acting extremely immature about this. You said it yourself, you have a better job than he does and you still expect him to finance the way you do? Do you have any human decency? I would be moving out as well.", "YTA, and a psycho too. Now instead of getting half of the rent paid, you\u2019ll pay the whole thing alone. Good for you.", "I cannot imagine how horrible it is to be a roomate of yours. YTA", "YTA. You locked him out for being two days late with the rent and you didn\u2019t even warn him first? Definitely an AH move.", "You are Vindictive and rude. If you felt comfortable to pay it all,why then turn around and punish him? Plus you knew when he gets paid. He can go out to decompress doesn't mean he has full amount of rent especially if he normally pays you back minus the little things which YOU COULD HAVE ASKED for the money back but chose not to. AH move.", "YTA. There are other ways of dealing with it. You could have told him that if he doesn't reimburse you when rent is due, you'll stop paying his portion and ask the landlord to take his portion from him directly.\n\nIn fact, that would have been a better approach because your landlord could legally evict the guy then. What you did was illegal and basically made the living situation hostile. I don't blame him for leaving.", "Why is your first reaction to someone being *two days* late on rent locking them out of the apartment? \nThat is extreme and incredibly unhealthy. You are a major AH.", "YTA. Not only are your actions illegal, they\u2019re cruel. You don\u2019t get to decide what he spends his money on, even if you think you\u2019re right. You both pay rent so the place is equally his as well as yours. It is not for you to decide he isn\u2019t welcome there because you are not the landlord; you pay rent just as much as he does. Get off your high horse and grow up. He deserves a better roommate because frankly, you sound like a pain to live with. I hope he\u2019s doing better. I\u2019d move out too if I were him.", "Yta you can't lock someone out for being two days late", "YTA. You literally made someone homeless because they were two days late on rent.
