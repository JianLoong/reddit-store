Jack used to take public transit and I used to be stuck in traffic on the QEW (local highway that's notoriously slow) so being able to take the HOV and cruise into work cut my commute time in half, it was a win win. \n\nThe problem, Jack smells awful. Like not just like a little BO after a workout, but like fucking rank rotting onions. At work its tolerable but sitting in a car for almost 40 minutes a day is just unbearable, and the smell lingers for long after he's gone so my car just permanently smells abysmal. So after about 2 weeks of commuting together I had enough. \n\nI decided that I should probably just be honest with him about the reason, and told him that the body odor was becoming unpleasant for me and that I didn't want to carpool anymore. He got really upset, telling me that it was unfair for me to just decided out of the blue to double his commute time and make him pay for public transit. When I talked to my girlfriend she said I should've at least asked him to shower or something before just refusing to drive together, but previous complaints have been made in the office and he didn't change his behavior so I assumed there was no point here.

He's gotta know that his hygiene is going to cause major problems in life. Better to learn the lesson like this than something way higher stakes.", "NTA\n\nIf several people already told him his hygiene sucks and he still isn't willing to change anything then this is fully on him.", "NTA\n\nThe only compromise you could have made would have been to give him a little bit of notice so he can adjust his plans.  But, smells are just such a big deal, I don\u2019t know if it would have been fair to you.  If you can\u2019t stand the smell, you don\u2019t have to carpool.  Hell, you never have to carpool with anyone.", "NTA and maybe that\u2019ll help him understand that stinking up shared spaces won\u2019t go unpunished his whole life. While it may not be a fireable offence it\u2019s certainly reason enough for people to spend as little time as possible in his vicinity.", "NTA, but I knew someone like that. I felt bad for them.\n\nThey had an extreme sensitivity to most antiperspirants. They showered daily, so it wasn\u2019t a hygiene issue. Turns out they *could* use the \u201cclinical strength\u201d antiperspirants sold in stores.\n\nI\u2019ve also read articles of some people whose biochemistry just causes them to smell very poorly.\n\nThis person might have a physiological issue going on. But if you\u2019re driving on the QEW, I would hope he has access to healthcare and hopefully prescriptions that can help with what\u2019s going on. He\u2019s just got to do something to address the situation.\n\nAgain, I feel poorly for this guy, but you can\u2019t make yourself sick and ruin your vehicle.", "NTA \n\nSmelling bad is genuinely the worst insult someone can receive imo, how has he not changed?", "NTA. \nYou done him a favour by telling him about his BO. Probably the best case of cruel to be kind. Not easy to hear but for his and everyone\u2019s benefit really. \nAlso, he was using public transport before, it\u2019s not as if this was his first and only method to commuting to work. He was getting a great bargain by chilling as a passenger, assume free ride into the office in less time and more favourable conditions than a bus. \nYou on the other hand making all the effort, and then having to stomach bad BO, especially when he was told about it before by others, was getting the short end of the stick. It wasn\u2019t a pleasant conversation but your NTA.", "NTA You had an arrangement and it wasn't working for you so you ended it. You didn't sign a contract in blood to carpool forever more. He should be grateful to have had a break from public transit for two weeks.", "NTA", "nta.", "Strictly speaking NTA I guess because nobody is obligated to drive the guy to work.\n\nI do think maybe you were short-sighted though.    If instead of cutting him off altogether you had made your willingness to commute with him contingent on him doing something about his body odor then everybody would have won (you, him, and your co-workers). \n\nIt sounds like you don\u2019t know much about what is causing his issues (you mentioned a medical condition, but you don\u2019t know the details).  So who knows whether there is more he could do to deal with it.", "Nta\n\nErmagerd, the consequences of one's actions...", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I don't think it's always about not showering I think sometimes it's also what environment they live in and if he's depressed who knows what environment he lives in. My best friend used to smell bad ALLL the time even if he showered and washed his clothes he would still smell because his place was full of rubbish literally and no matter how many times we told him it took my ex moving in and him getting a gf before he cleaned up his place, for real. Sometimes you got to acknowledge at least that they could be in a bad place right now and can't seem to sort this.", "NTA!! It is not okay to penetrate someone's olfactory orifices with odious odors! Fuck that. You should not feel bad. *He* should feel bad.", "NTA - you can decide whether or not you want to carpool.", "Nta he had to pay before you car pooled. Your car your choice.", "NTA, that sounds truly unbearable. I also applaud your honesty.\n\nDo you think it's from not bathing/not washing his clothes? Because if it is, since you've already been honest, you could give him another chance. Make him sign a contract that, before getting in your car, he will have showered with antibacterial soap, THAT MORNING, and wear freshly laundered clothes. This is not a guy who needs to be treated with kid gloves... if he's never learned good hygiene, spell it out for him. And if he breaks the contract, his ride is over. \n\nThe reason I think it's worth another shot is that if he didn't stink, it would be a good deal for both of you. Sitting in traffic is not fun. The carpool lane would cut your commute in half. \n\nThe only other option I can think of is to put a luggage rack on top of your car and have him ride up there.", ">telling me that it was unfair for me to just decided out of the blue to double his commute time and make him pay for public transit\n\nHis commute time is based on how far he chooses to live from work. His public transport costs are based on what the local transit authority charges, as he didn't choose to provide himself with an alternative way to get to work. Neither situation is caused by you nor your fault. The appropriate response would have been to thank you for the time and money you saved him while you carpooled.\n\nIf he wants to carpool, why doesn't he provide a car? You could drive to his place and park, and then use his car to ride in together. That way he only damages his own vehicle.", "NTA. It was a tough situation. A lot of people would have avoided telling him it is because of his BO, but I think that you will do him a favor in the long run if you do.", "NTA\n \nHe\u2019s aware. You didn\u2019t belabor it.", "Your car, your choice. Sucks for him to have to go back to public transit but that\u2019s not your fault. You didn\u2019t leave him in any different position than what he was in before. \n\nHe can be mad. Mad and stinky.", "Yeah, as far as I can tell it is a medical issue which is why I feel particularly bad. Also unfortunate fact about Canadian healthcare, even though it is mostly public lots of things aren't covered, including dental, optometry and most egregiously prescriptions.", "And honestly even if he didn't smell, you would still be \"NTA\" if you didn't want to drive him to work. It's your car, your choice. He's a working adult and isn't entitled to your car or a ride!", ">His commute time is based on how far he chooses to live from work.

I truly feel for the dude, but yeah, still NAH.", "So it\u2019s not that he has bad hygiene, it\u2019s that he has a medical condition? I feel like you shouldn\u2019t have left that out of the OP. It definitely changes the situation. You\u2019re not an AH for not wanting to put up with the smell. Be he isn\u2019t one either if he has no control over it."]}
