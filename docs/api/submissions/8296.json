He was getting a great bargain by chilling as a passenger, assume free ride into the office in less time and more favourable conditions than a bus. \nYou on the other hand making all the effort, and then having to stomach bad BO, especially when he was told about it before by others, was getting the short end of the stick.

If instead of cutting him off altogether you had made your willingness to commute with him contingent on him doing something about his body odor then everybody would have won (you, him, and your co-workers). \n\nIt sounds like you don\u2019t know much about what is causing his issues (you mentioned a medical condition, but you don\u2019t know the details).

I don't think it's always about not showering I think sometimes it's also what environment they live in and if he's depressed who knows what environment he lives in. My best friend used to smell bad ALLL the time even if he showered and washed his clothes he would still smell because his place was full of rubbish literally and no matter how many times we told him it took my ex moving in and him getting a gf before he cleaned up his place, for real. Sometimes you got to acknowledge at least that they could be in a bad place right now and can't seem to sort this.", "NTA!! It is not okay to penetrate someone's olfactory orifices with odious odors! Fuck that. You should not feel bad. *He* should feel bad.", "NTA - you can decide whether or not you want to carpool.", "Nta he had to pay before you car pooled. Your car your choice.", "NTA, that sounds truly unbearable. I also applaud your honesty.\n\nDo you think it's from not bathing/not washing his clothes? Because if it is, since you've already been honest, you could give him another chance. Make him sign a contract that, before getting in your car, he will have showered with antibacterial soap, THAT MORNING, and wear freshly laundered clothes. This is not a guy who needs to be treated with kid gloves... if he's never learned good hygiene, spell it out for him. And if he breaks the contract, his ride is over. \n\nThe reason I think it's worth another shot is that if he didn't stink, it would be a good deal for both of you. Sitting in traffic is not fun. The carpool lane would cut your commute in half. \n\nThe only other option I can think of is to put a luggage rack on top of your car and have him ride up there.", ">telling me that it was unfair for me to just decided out of the blue to double his commute time and make him pay for public transit\n\nHis commute time is based on how far he chooses to live from work. His public transport costs are based on what the local transit authority charges, as he didn't choose to provide himself with an alternative way to get to work. Neither situation is caused by you nor your fault. The appropriate response would have been to thank you for the time and money you saved him while you carpooled.\n\nIf he wants to carpool, why doesn't he provide a car? You could drive to his place and park, and then use his car to ride in together. That way he only damages his own vehicle.", "NTA. It was a tough situation. A lot of people would have avoided telling him it is because of his BO, but I think that you will do him a favor in the long run if you do.", "NTA\n \nHe\u2019s aware. You didn\u2019t belabor it.", "Your car, your choice. Sucks for him to have to go back to public transit but that\u2019s not your fault. You didn\u2019t leave him in any different position than what he was in before. \n\nHe can be mad. Mad and stinky.", "Yeah, as far as I can tell it is a medical issue which is why I feel particularly bad. Also unfortunate fact about Canadian healthcare, even though it is mostly public lots of things aren't covered, including dental, optometry and most egregiously prescriptions.", "And honestly even if he didn't smell, you would still be \"NTA\" if you didn't want to drive him to work.

He did shower twice day as he was a mechanic.  His shoes had to be kept outside because they stank so badly.  Cleanliness was the issue. \n\nHe had renal cancer.  Once chemotherapy started, no more eye watering body odor.", "LOL fuck no. You are NTA. He smells, you don't want to smell it, he won't fix it. Does it need to get more complicated than that? \n\nIt's a known issue he won't address, anything else in regards to his reaction is his problem. Transit costs, time to get to work, even asking him to \"shower\" (this is disgusting btw to even have a convo like this with a coworker) has nothing to do with you.\n\nYou've made it clear what you need and he won't do it.\n\nDone and done.", "OP was honest even tried it and it didn\u2019t work", "NTA. You aren't doubling his communte time or making him pay for transit, that was his previous circumstance. After a couple-few weeks trial period, you decided to stop cutting his commute time in half or saving him transit costs. And at your own inconvenience as well.

Avoiding booze, smokes, and foods like asparagus and fish helps a lot.  He can also get different medicated washes.  There are two types.  One exists in the arm pits and groin, the stinky areas.  The other is a bit more body-wide and involves more proteins on his skin.\n\nI think hotter showers are actually good, too.\n\nThis link has some really good advice:  https://thompsontee.com/blog/bromhidrosis-unpacking-excessive-body-odor/", "It's got nothing to do with hygiene. OP has commented that it is a medical issue.", "Also botox helps. NTA", "I came down to the comments to say this! Instantly thought of this at the onions comment. You can shower every single day, and it doesn't matter, you start to smell again shortly after. If I don't put on a suffocating layer of prescription anti-antiperspirant/deodorant on the affected areas, I will start to smell within 30 minutes of showering, and it's MORTIFYING. He needs to see a doctor if this is the issue.", "Yeah that comment of him wasn't there yet when I made my reply.", "Yeah, that\u2019s burying the lede. He can\u2019t help it. It kind of makes OP a TA for not disclosing that in the first place so we could make a proper judgment and that whole its been brought up at work so he didn\u2019t ask him to shower, he didn\u2019t ask bcuz the poor guy can\u2019t help it.", "Hard disagree. The OP, because he could handle the odor in the office and had likely never driven in a car with the guy, probably thought that it wouldn\u2019t be that awful. Until they were closed up in a car together for 40 minutes. Medical condition or not, nobody has to put up with that just for the sake of convenience. Add to that the fact that this info is not new to the guy and he\u2019s not done anything (or at least hasn\u2019t found a workable solution) to his body odor means the OP is NTA.", "Whether he can help it or not, it's not OPs burden to bear.  OP is still NTA.", "NTA", "Ugh, the QEW!\n\n  Could you have tried asking him to shower/do something to not smell? Maybe. Should you have had to do that? No. Are you in the wrong for not wanting his smell to infect your car? Not at all.

If there is a prescription that will help,  some prescription companies offer discounts on their website maybe he can look into that.", "NTA\n\nI have walked past people with extreme bo and it just ruined my day.

I used to have a colleague like that and had to use different excuses not to take her even though we lived close-by.

Then on a work placement the boss called him in to the office and said staff were complaining about his BO. (He said it wasn\u2019t him it was his boots).

But it's out there now and you know. Not that I think OP should have to tolerate overwhelming stink that soaks into his car, but I feel for the guy. If he has the condition I think he does, showering isn't sufficient, which I found out the hard way. You start to stink again within about 30 minutes of showering, and it's upsetting and embarrassing to know you just showered, put on clean clothes, and splashed on a bit of perfume or cologne, and now you smell like perfume/cologne and rotting onion.\n\nMine requires Hibiclens washes and a thick slather of RX antiperspirant and deodorant, and OP's country is crappy about prescriptions.
