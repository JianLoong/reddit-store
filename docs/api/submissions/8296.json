He has been made aware of the issue, has done nothing about it, so let him face the consequences.\n\nEditing after seeing that this is a medical issue and not bad hygiene. I still stand by NTA, because bad BO, regardless of the issue, is difficult to stomach.

One day he injured himself and couldn't drive. I lived just a few blocks away from him, so he asked if I would be his ride until he could drive again. His office mates asked me to talk to him about his odor. Turns out he bathed every day. He used a cologne that he really liked, but it apparently did not mix well with his natural body chemicals. That was the cause of the odor. He didn't realize that he stank, he only smelled the cologne. The office mates gifted him with a new cologne.", "NTA. Unfair to return him to the state he was in 2 weeks ago?

The smell issue aside, how your coworkers commute to work is not your problem.", "NTA - tough situation but I feel like you addressed it as gently as possible.", "Tough one, but if you ended the arrangement without giving him a chance to improve the situation I would consider you TAH.  IF you give him the chance to improve the odor, and he does not, then you're NTA for ending the arrangement.", "NTA \n\nI was going to say a soft Y T A until you mentioned comments in the office. He has no excuse at that point. Don't let him make your car stink to high heaven, it can be a pain to get the smell out.", "NTA and it has nothing to do with hygiene. Driving someone to work and always being the driver can be straining.", "NTA---he should be taking care of his own personal hygiene without someone needing to tell him.  I don't blame you at all!", "NTA You didn't MAKE him pay for public transit.  You saved him from it for two weeks.  I wouldn't help him again even if he did fix himself up, because he's ungrateful and deflecting blame.", "So this is someone who\u2019s has been notified of a body odour issue at least once before you and has not yet rectified the situation.  It\u2019s not your job to get the fella to work and I think you were right to be honest as to why you didn\u2019t want to carpool anymore.  Although he may have been hurt, he cannot wonder why.\nNTA", "NTA. He probably has depression or other issues that may cause him issues with hygiene maintenance but at the end of the day you don\u2019t have to put up with that if you are doing somebody a favor. It was probably smart to be honest and just do your own thing because if it\u2019s already been brought up before it\u2019s just going to make it more awkward when you tell him and he doesn\u2019t change and then you have to stop driving him anyway", "NTA.\n\nAnd wait - if he\u2019s complaining about paying for public transit, does that mean he wasn\u2019t contributing to your carpool?", "NTA, it really just comes down to it being your car.", "NTA. He knew he stank before you started carpooling and didn\u2019t care.", "No hahah it's your car.", "Nta. BO and jobs are a very gray, sensitive area. Do you have a medical issue or are you not showering and using deordant/antiperspirant for some reason? Ultimately it is up to you as it's your car. You can choose not to pick him up. You aren't forcing him to take public transport...that's on him.", "NTA\n\nYou don't have to carpool with anyone you don't want to. Him saying it's gonna double his commute time by taking the bus is his problem and manipulation on his part towards you. Fuck that.", "NTA - Good on you for telling him so he can address the problem.

He is not dealing with it.", "Hard to say... have you tried to figure out if this person has a condition or a problem? maybe it's not a matter of having a shower, but going to the doctor.", "NTA.   It amazes me that people carpool at all.   Back when I was doing the corporate grind, that little 35 minute ride to work was the only solitude I ever got.   I've got a loud-mouth lazy husband at home, I've got people barking at me at work.  That little bit of peace and quiet driving back and forth to work in rush hour traffic - crazy as it seems - was what held my sanity together - how pitiful is that?   Slightly less pitiful than losing my sanity all to give somebody a ride to work.", "NTA? You could do that for two weeks???? Day two and it would have been over for me, but then again at day one i would already said something to him, like, if you smell tomorrow morning you will not sit in my car.", "As a Buffalonian who frequently took advantage of that Ontario drinking age, I can't believe the memories that just flooded me at seeing 'QEW'.... So thank you for that. \n\n>was unfair for me to just decided out of the blue to double his commute time and make him pay for public transit\n\nThe smell aside, what would happen if you got a new job or your hours change.  You are not responsible for Jack's commute. NTA", "NTA.

You're making them all suffer just because you can't suck it up. \n\n/s\n\nI used to ride public transit regularly to work. I also used to travel long distances by bus. I ALWAYS made it a point to be freshly showered before getting on the bus that morning. It's a simple courtesy to other passengers. Kind of like not blasting music from your phone without headphones while on the bus. \n\nYour co-worker is the one who is being rude by not only ignoring how his hygeine habits affect others around him, but by making you seem like you're the AH because you won't put up with his odor. \n\nIf you don't want to shower, that's your choice. But don't expect me to allow you in my personal space (or car) if you choose that.", "Likely a medical issue so could be not the poor guy's fault either but still NTA \n\nThere's nothing \"unfair\" about someone deciding to not give others a ride for any reason.

OP is an asshole because he doesn\u2019t want his car to stink? Sure, it\u2019s a medical issue, but it\u2019s also a problem. Strong smells permeate fabric and then it becomes OP\u2019s problem. It is not the same thing as a glass eye. Grow up.", "DRYSOL.

It\u2019s not that I\u2019ve anything against autistic people, it\u2019s that I\u2019ve something against bullshit and it just so happens that a medical condition makes those with that condition more prone to bullshit.", "What does Canadian healthcare not covering dental *for adults* has to do with this? \nBesides, If they\u2019re in QC they can get RAMQ to cover a fair amount for prescriptions (and if it ain\u2019t covered then it probably is cheap enough so a working man can afford it, IE 10-50$ ballpark).

Nothing changed. OP acted like he was being noble and being frank so the guy can fix the problem by telling the truth ... But since the guy knew and it is a medical issue that can't be changed it isn't noble it is rude. OP also left out that it was a medical issue in the original post, which feel like an AH thing because it effects judgement.\n\nAnd your somewhat right about the glass eye statement because that isn't necessarily distracting or unpleasant  let me fix it :\n\nIt is like telling a person with Tourette Syndrome that their tics are too annoying and distracting  to be around. Yes they may be bothersome,  however it is out of the person's control and just rude to say that", "I Use something called drysol and it changed my life. If anyone is suffering from excessive body oder and stress sweating, its an absolute life saver. Its a prescription but its not prescription deodorant.

There is not much to help this medical condition. I did say OP was NTA. But to say it's his fault... No. That's not cool. You can be heartless, but I refuse to be. So just stop.", "Hard disagree. OP mentioned somewhere that he knew about the BO but didn\u2019t realize it would be as bad as it was in the car. A confined space changes one\u2019s tolerance for strong odours.
