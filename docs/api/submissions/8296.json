I still stand by NTA, because bad BO, regardless of the issue, is difficult to stomach.

One day he injured himself and couldn't drive. I lived just a few blocks away from him, so he asked if I would be his ride until he could drive again. His office mates asked me to talk to him about his odor. Turns out he bathed every day. He used a cologne that he really liked, but it apparently did not mix well with his natural body chemicals. That was the cause of the odor. He didn't realize that he stank, he only smelled the cologne. The office mates gifted him with a new cologne.", "NTA.
