That impulsiveness and adrenaline rush is real.", "The brother is TA because he made a promise he couldn't fullfil and then guilt tripped OP about it", "Nah I know a good amount of 30-somethings who will change your mind about that real quick", "As someone with a lot of family in their 30s, I disagree, their desire to speed is the same as when they were in their 20s. Some just do it more responsibly, like in tracks. Others, do it less responsibly, but still aren't speeding down every road and only when there are no people and they have a clear view of everything ahead of them on a straight road.\n\nI would also say its pretty likely he'll speed a bit for his daughter like 60 in a 40. or something.", "I am also team Petty", "What a cynical way to view the world.", "Love this! \ud83d\ude02", "The fact these people are trying to force him to do stuff for someone who isn\u2019t his child is low key annoying", "That or go to a dealership to do a test drive", "You have one, too? We hated when my dad would test drive the sports cars at dealerships and he would always punch it when he could. It got to the point where my mom, sister, and I made sure we were seated next to what we affectionately coined the \"Oh Shit\" handle. He almost made one of the salespeople throw up one time when he did it and while the salesperson was panicking, my sister and I just rolled our eyes and leaned back while grabbing the handles.", "We don't know how old the niece is, luxury sports cars don't really accommodate car seats. So if they had to get rid of it before she could ride without one the girl may not have gotten the opportunity before.", "And? Why shouldn\u2019t people in general act in their best self interest? Being selfless is absolutely useless especially in a situation like this.", "And it\u2019s ok to be petty and say no, especially when other factors are contributing. It\u2019s his car. He doesn\u2019t have to share.", "Obviously the probability of you being correct is greater. My point is that OP is asking for judgment on his specific situation. If you\u2019re judging a specific situation, you need to ask for the particulars instead of assuming that you know what the answer is based on probability. I had a math teacher in high school who was fond of the phrase \u201cTo ASSUME is to make an ASS out of U and ME.\u201d", "Oh, I think that\u2019s precisely what\u2019s up. I think he wants to drive the car and is using his kid as an excuse. That\u2019s why offering to take her for a ride is a great idea - makes the brother look like an ass if he declines something he claims his daughter wants to do.", "That's what I thought too but then I reread the post and saw it was 2-3 months ago that he got rid of it.", "What if one's self-interest includes being selfless? *Then* what?", "Agreed. Funny how people here tell OPs to go full petty, but when an OP actually acts petty, they're judgmental and saying Y T A. It's OP's car, end of discussion. It's his choice who gets behind the wheel. If niece is in the car or not is irrelevant at the bottom line. Going to my own drum here, and saying OP is NTA.", "I\u2019m not saying that OP should let his brother drive his car. But I\u2019m saying that there\u2019s probably data showing that drivers under 25 are a significantly higher risk.\n\nSomeone has never seen Ferris Bueller\u2019s Day off and it shows.", "The thing is, it is normal to refuse a college student that is trying to impress his GF borrowing your sports car. The demography has a reputation of being reckless to impress others. As laid out in the post of OP we have no reason to think the brother acted like a dick to OP. So why would people cheer on OP for starting with being petty? \n\nObviously it is OPs car and he can do whatever he wants and he is not an AH for refusing, he is an AH for the reason he gives in the post though. \n\nThis sub does not judge 'do you have the right to' it just judges if you acted like an AH", "Yeah, brother himself set the standard, but now cries 'no fair!!' NTA OP", "I love that movie & wish I could have done that in high school."]}
