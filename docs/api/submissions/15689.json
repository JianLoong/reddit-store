I presume he did not trust you because you were an immature college student trying to impress a girl with vanity. Your brother's situation four years later is much different. \n\nI'd normally say ESH or NAH, but you and your brother both have different reasons for refusing each other's requests. I'd say yours is much more asshole-ish. Maybe I'm reaching too much, but by your maturity here I could definitely see why your request was denied earlier on.", "NTA your brother shouldn\u2019t have promised your niece anything before asking you first.

How can I put this?\nPeople are calling you petty, but you are the younger brother, so you learned it within the family dynamic that spawned your older brother.\n\nYour older brother voluntold your car to his kid because 'show off'??

Grow up.", "having an 20 something year old drive a sports car to impress a girl is different than adult trying to make a little girl happy. it would be one thing to say no because he can't be trusted but you did it out of spite. teenagers tend to be less trustworthy with fast cars and girls, so you can't blame him.", "Nta- if it was really about his daughter , he would ask you to take her for a ride .\n\nThis is all about him wanting to look good at after school pick up.", "NTA. regardless of OP's reasons at the end of the day, it is his property.", "F always being the bigger person!!

Obviously, you two are not close.\n\nThat being said, I fully agree with you in shutting down his request.  I would go a step further and initiate full no contact after this.  He fell on hard times?  Boo hoo.  Siblings are just the worst anyway, so I say ban him and his family from your life.
