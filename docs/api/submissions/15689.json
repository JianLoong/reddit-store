That's what people who have any sort of relationship would do.\n\nThe most likely scenario is that Bigbro wants to borrow the car to impress someone. Someone who is not a little girl.

Have I gone insane? \n>\n>I wouldn\u2019t let anyone anywhere near my sports car.\n\nCompletely agree.

Insurance rates drop at 25 unless you have an accident history. Drivers under the age of 30 have the slowest reaction times.\n\nIf he was under 25, and we can assume it's likely, then he's not exactly first choice for driving an expensive car. If he had an accident while driving it, it would have been a legal issue because he wouldn't be on his brother's car insurance and his brother would have been on the hook for any damages. So I'm sure some folks think he's an AH for asking, especially at that age.\n\nHowever, the question OP is looking to have answered is not if he's the AH for asking, but if he's an AH for saying no to his brother since his brother said no to him. And based on that, I'd say NTA.\n\nHis brother called out of the blue because he doesn't try to maintain a close relationship with OP outside of holidays. He doesn't do anything to try to foster a relationship between OP and his niece (if OP would even want that). And rather than asking if OP would be willing to give the niece a ride, he asked to drive it himself, which even though they're older, there's still the same insurance risk.

Therefore, I don\u2019t trust her with my car. \n\nI wonder exactly why OP doesn\u2019t trust his brother to borrow the car? Is it just because he didn\u2019t let OP drive his sports car 4+ years ago or is OP concerned that his brother, for example, would keep it longer promised?

Like if u live in America, having some1 else drive your car who gets in an accident, even if it isn't their fault, can negate the insurance companies obligation to cover it if they aren't listed as a driver on your insurance plan. We know insurance is expensive AF, so many who need to drive to work but barely make ends meet let their insurance lapse or don't carry it at all, leaving the rest of us screwed, and many insurance companies do everything they can to find any loophole to get out of paying for the claim. \n\nNone of us have to lend anyone our car for any reason and it's reasonable to say no. \n\nThe only thing that makes OP kinda suck just a tiny itty bit is they admit it's like petty revenge b/c his bro said no when OP was in early 20's. If he had just said no, OP wouldn't suck just a smidge. OP isn't an AH even for his petty revenge since the bro deserves it for being hypocritical, self-centered, entitled, and making a promise to his kid w/o actually asking first. \n\nI thought it was going to be like, my bros car broke down and kid is stuck at extracurriculars or school, not just for a joy ride in a cool car.
