We see him occasionally and he comes to holidays, but he doesn't speak to any of us or acknowledge us. She won't babysit her grandkids because it wouldn't be fair to Owen to have them in the house.  We once even went on a vacation together and he just doesn't speak to us. Everyone tolerates it because MIL is really happy and she is a nightmare to deal with when she isn't happy.\n\nAnyway my kids are getting old enough to notice that he ignores all of us.

MIL got upset and said I was being selfish and demanding, and to just leave Owen alone. I said it isn't fair to my kids and I am sick of being disrespected.

He thought she was a psycho? Why does he keep showing up to \u201cstrangers\u201d holidays and sitting there in silence?", "NTA\n\nYou don't need to be around Owen. Your kids don't need to be around Owen. MIL doesn't need to bring Owen to \\_family\\_ gatherings.\n\nOwen doesn't want to be part of the family, so you're entirely justified leaving him out of any family happenings.", "NTA.\n\nWhat you're doing comes down to this: You are not required to set you or your children up for Owen to be rude to you. Being welcoming to guests in your home does not mean that they, or their children, are \"your problem,\" in any meaningful way, so Owen is taking your MIL's promise (which was batshit in the first place) to a strange and distant land by not speaking to people when they come to holidays.\n\nYour MIL made a promise to Owen, but YOU did not. You did not agree to have an ogre travel with you on family vacations. You did not agree that every Christmas morning would involve some dude trying to pretend there were no children on the premises. You did not agree to continue going to MIL's house an infinite number of times so that you could be made to feel incredibly awkward there.\n\nYour MIL's (again: completely batshit) promise has certain costs to keep. One of those costs probably should that your MIL's children and grandchildren will not be hanging out at her house, coming to holidays, or inviting her massively unpleasant partner to their homes. That is what your MIL chose when she chose Owen. If Owen wants to be left alone, fine, but \"being left alone\" is not a thing that comes with dinner invitations.\n\nI don't get why your husband is okay with this situation - it must have really sucked to have your mom decide that her happiness rested on being able to pretend you didn't exist. You are not making drama for no reason, the drama has always been here, and it has been fucking THOROUGHLY repressed by the people at Drama Ground Zero. You are about a mile away from Ground Zero, and your sense of self was not vaporized, so... this is a totally reasonable quantity of drama. MIL has been creating misery for years, she's just upset now because there is a consequence.", "NTA.\n\nIf Owen doesn't want a family, what is he doing at family gatherings?  If the gathering is at the house he shares with your MIL, he should at least make an effort to acknowledge the guests, whether he views them as family or not.\n\nYou have a right to stay out of situations that make you uncomfortable.

NTA\n\nThis woman is a self-absorbed horror and her husband is the perfect complement. \n\nWhy would you want to spend any time with them? Does Owen acknowledge your husband or does he sit there and only speak to his wife??\n\nI wouldn't go to anything with them, nor would I invite them to anything.

You can not do anything.

That agreement was made and accepted by both, not your call to change it.  \n\nI don\u2019t think you\u2019re the AH for keeping your kids away. TBH, Owen sounds like a rude jerk. I can understand not wanting to raise the teens however to act like y\u2019all don\u2019t exist and won\u2019t talk to you is beyond.  I don\u2019t even know why y\u2019all would go on vacation with that fool.

Because other people aren\u2019t required to be enamored with your children. They just have to not be AH\u2019s. \n\nOwen avoiding everyone isn\u2019t really an AH move in my opinion. \n\nFrankly, most people I know (and I\u2019m mid 40\u2019s) had a relative or friend of parents who was a little crabby or didn\u2019t like kids. Know what all of us kids at the time did? We steered clear and spent time with the people who showed interest in us. \n\nFurther, the fact that your MIL won\u2019t babysit seems like the real underlying issue and the thing is, just because she\u2019s Gma doesn\u2019t mean she is required to babysit. For all you know, she simply doesn\u2019t want to and is using Owen as an excuse. \n\nOf course spend your time as you wish. But to think that somehow your absence will be seen as punishment is pretty short sighted. If you wanted to punish Owen, you would have taken your kids\u2014and hyped up on candy with noisy toys. You keeping the kids home only hurts you/your husband\u2014it\u2019s a gift to Owen and anyone else who doesn\u2019t have a lot of tolerance for chaos and noise that children often bring to any situation. \n\nNAH", "ESH.\n\nThey are entitled to their life.
