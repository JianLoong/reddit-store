He thought she was a psycho? Why does he keep showing up to \u201cstrangers\u201d holidays and sitting there in silence?", "NTA\n\nYou don't need to be around Owen. Your kids don't need to be around Owen. MIL doesn't need to bring Owen to \\_family\\_ gatherings.\n\nOwen doesn't want to be part of the family, so you're entirely justified leaving him out of any family happenings.", "NTA.\n\nWhat you're doing comes down to this: You are not required to set you or your children up for Owen to be rude to you. Being welcoming to guests in your home does not mean that they, or their children, are \"your problem,\" in any meaningful way, so Owen is taking your MIL's promise (which was batshit in the first place) to a strange and distant land by not speaking to people when they come to holidays.\n\nYour MIL made a promise to Owen, but YOU did not. You did not agree to have an ogre travel with you on family vacations. You did not agree that every Christmas morning would involve some dude trying to pretend there were no children on the premises. You did not agree to continue going to MIL's house an infinite number of times so that you could be made to feel incredibly awkward there.\n\nYour MIL's (again: completely batshit) promise has certain costs to keep. One of those costs probably should that your MIL's children and grandchildren will not be hanging out at her house, coming to holidays, or inviting her massively unpleasant partner to their homes. That is what your MIL chose when she chose Owen. If Owen wants to be left alone, fine, but \"being left alone\" is not a thing that comes with dinner invitations.\n\nI don't get why your husband is okay with this situation - it must have really sucked to have your mom decide that her happiness rested on being able to pretend you didn't exist. You are not making drama for no reason, the drama has always been here, and it has been fucking THOROUGHLY repressed by the people at Drama Ground Zero. You are about a mile away from Ground Zero, and your sense of self was not vaporized, so... this is a totally reasonable quantity of drama.

Know what all of us kids at the time did? We steered clear and spent time with the people who showed interest in us. \n\nFurther, the fact that your MIL won\u2019t babysit seems like the real underlying issue and the thing is, just because she\u2019s Gma doesn\u2019t mean she is required to babysit. For all you know, she simply doesn\u2019t want to and is using Owen as an excuse. \n\nOf course spend your time as you wish.

I\u2019ve heard he talks a lot of shit about us with her sister", "Her kids were in high school. They couldn\u2019t just walk away and unfortunately none of them will because there is an inheritance at stake", "Sounds like my mom and her child free husband.   It's awful and not ok.  I recently went no contact due to their behavior like this.  My family doesn't deserve that treatment ever again says me!", "+3 vote to not at all, remove the kids from the situation.", "MIL may have unilaterally made promises to Owen, but you didn't. Your husband didn't. Your kids didn't. \n\nI can't imagine it's healthy for kids to grow up believing it's perfectly ok for an adult family member to treat them this way.", "You can remove yourself from the situation. You can take a stand for the dignity of yourself and your kids. Even if this means your husband goes running to mom's house with the kids because she holds his purse strings, the kids will see one of their parents who refuses to lower herself to that level, and will have the option, as they get older, of following your example instead of his.", "I'm so sorry for this, for you and your mom. my mom hated me because, as she constantly reminded me, \"I ruined her life.\" I don't know what else to say, but keep yourself safe and be kind to yourself. what she is/believes is not the norm. one of my fav song quotes, \"...there are guides and spirits all along the way who will defend us...\" Kingdom Hall by Van Morrison .....sending a big hug", "ugh, sorry you are in this situation. I hope you get some peace.", "I\u2019m sorry you/your children have to go through this. I had my children young but I knew there were certain family members we wouldn\u2019t be spending extended periods of time with. My mom called me petty/vindictive, but my kids didn\u2019t grow up with the same insecurities I did. Sometimes it was hard OP because, I was use to being treated a certain way, but when I see how happy and loved my kids feel, the distance was definitely worth it. I hope you and your husband can reach a compromise that benefits your children.", "oh give me a break. you had NoO iDeAaa you\u2019d be upset with someone being directly rude to your children? you were a grown adult and  made a choice, stop telling other people how to live their lives. quite honestly your little tidbit abojt the lack of free babysitting is telling. if owen is so awful to your kids why would you even WANT him babysitting? you were fine with this until you realized you weren\u2019t getting childcare", "He stopped being the victim the moment he married a woman with children. At that moment, he DID sign up for it. Regardless of what she told him on the airplane...eventually the truth came out and they agreed to continue the relationship.", "Don\u2019t exactly think you are an a**hole but kind of disagree with your logic. Saying this as an ancient old lady. \n\nSome members of my family were not perfect. They made mistakes. They never admitted to or apologized for these mistakes. Had I cut these people out of my life, I would have hurt myself. Some of the things these people did to support me and to try to please me were actually wonderful. \n\nYou can explain to your children that mil\u2019s husband is an a**hole. Kids can understand. If he is not attacking the kids, but just ignoring them, your explanation will keep them from being damaged. \n\nMy family was not perfect, but my life was greatly enriched because of my parents, great-grandparents, grandparents, and my brother. We all have the freedom to make our own choices -good or bad. I am not and have never been perfect. Fortunately, my now adult children tease me about my imperfections and don\u2019t hold them against me. Their lives were enriched because I allowed them contact with all of their relatives-those who were mostly good and those who were imperfect. As adults they were able to separate the wheat from the chaff.", "YTA. Self-esteem is an internal thing NOT external.", "You're a shitty writer MIL troll. Take a class.", "NTA NTA NTA. kids notice things like this. its really damaging!", "NTA \n\nSeeing your comments ig everyone in your husband's family just loves Money. Not wrong we all love money. but they seem to Forgive your MIL who chose to NOT have her kids to have HER husband. I would say go NC with your MIL and her husband. tell your husband that you and your kids will not be attending the family events if MIL brings the owen guy. I don't see Owen guy is wrong here in any way. but you MIL and you Husband is the AH", "NtA but just don't go. If your husband wants to go then he can take the kids and it's his job to explain what's up when they ask about it. Just drop the rope.", "NTA why would go anywhere with a grownass man who ignores you? That is just antisocial. You go hang out with people who want to be with you. Owen says 'you are nothing to me'. Fair enough, now Owen is nothing to you or your family. Why would anyone tolerate being around Owen or invite him to anything even he is so obviously against having a normal social interaction with people in that setting. Eg if you went travelling with friends and ran into someone they knew, you would be polite and friendly if they introduced you even though they are strangers and have no long term relationship.", "ESH. To be honest, I'm not sure what I just read. How tiresome everyone is.", "Mil married a man that is not interested in kids and acts like their not there so if that\u2019s the case the you and the kids won\u2019t exist in their world, your husband can be his moms friend or whatever he likes. But it sounds like this hurt your husband and is desperately trying to keep whatever relationship with his mother that she will give him.", "Why would you attend a brunch where one of the hosts doesn't want you there? NTA.", "ESH - you can't make your MIL or her husband change and you don't have a right to ask. This doesn't mean no consequences. Don't go to events where your MIL's husband is going to be, don't invite him into your home. Protect your children if you need to but don't use them as a cudgel against your MIL because you don't agree with her choices. As an aside you don't have a right to free babysitting just in case that's the issue.", "YTA. \n\n> Everyone tolerates it because MIL is really happy and she is a nightmare to deal with when she isn't happy.\n\nFor ever putting up with this.", "NTA it doesn't hurt Owen to be respectful in person. It's fair to not ask for child care, but he's gone too extreme. Why subject yourself and your children to someone so passive-aggressive to give the silent treatment at all times.", "YOur MIL is a weirdo. Your husband needs to grow a pair too.", "ESH. You for going behind your partners back to your inlaws. \n\nYour partner for not backing you on this.\n\nYour MIL for lying to her then-boyfriend (and some more, but this was the first...)\n\nOwen for being an ass to people in his wife's life.", "NTA. Maybe you should just take this ignoring thing to a higher level. Don\u2019t just pretend by not speaking to him. Pretend he doesn\u2019t exist in that space. Teach your kids that they can sit where he is or play where he is. If you \u201caccidentally\u201c spill your drink on him; make sure to apologize for spilling it on the couch. Don\u2019t let him eat or drink at your house. \u201cHey, where\u2019s that full plate of food going\u201d, as you grab it from him, wrap it and put it away. If MIL enters the house first, shut the door on him and lock it.  The fun will be endless", "NTA and don't let your husband put any other thoughts in your head, you're teaching your kids not to tolerate such rude behavior to cover up a blatant lie of a grown woman.\n\ninfo: what exactly is this \"Misery\" and \"sadness\" the MIL went through WHILE CHEATING, which was so intolerable by her own kids?", "NTA. Start talking to the partners of the siblings here. I suggest you guys make your own holiday/vacation plans. Then on the MIL hosted ones only the actual siblings go. If MIL wants to attend your events she can do so but without Owen. Tell them those are family centric events and Owen isn\u2019t family.", "Yea this. I also wouldn't be surprised if Owen is being dragged to these family functions by MIL.", "MIL and Owen both sound like horrible people.  Don't force Owen to speak to or acknowledge your kids - he won't say anything nice and you know that.   Teach your kids that not all people are nice people, that they still have the duty to be kind and polite even if he isn't, but not to put any importance at all on Owen.  Or MIL either - I mean what kind of woman makes a deal like that?", "NTA.  What a batshit crazy situation.  I don't blame you at all; being ignored grinds on my nerves and would have made me paranoid even at a young age.  Stand your ground - if MIL wants to see the grandkids, she can visit without the additional nutjob.", "This should really be the top comment, it breaks the situation down perfectly.", "This is probably the best answer I've ever read in AITA. Great job!", "Trick is they both are and that's why they work so well together. You can't have your cake and eat it too, he decided to stay so clearly it wasn't that much of a dealbreaker and he's not that much above her", "Ok, so reading through your comments and realising there's this whole money controlled relationships thing going down I would say you need to get counselling advice and ongoing therapy for the kids as they grow up to support them in understanding the financial control of relationships. This is an incredibly harmful family pattern to pass on. I have grown up with some family members having a financial relationship and it NEVER ends well! My sister wasn't dependant on my uncle but I remember him telling her he would disinherit her if she continued dating a Malaysian guy (he was really racist). She just ignored him but this is the kind of thing relatives do when they think they have financial power in the family.", "She isn't disrespecting Owen's boundaries, just protecting her own children. Shouldn't she be allowed to maintain her own boundaries as well?", "Why do you want a relationship with this woman?", "Sounds like another reason to limit contact to me.", "There it is. I was wondering when the money bit was going to come. I wasn't understanding why someone ignoring you and your kids is such an issue. Don't talk to him, don't invite him to your house. How is this such a big deal? The big deal is that your husband is more than ok to be around this man because he's always around your MIL and she's the money tree. Owen might be an AH, but so is your MIL and your husband. Your are an AH because you want to change MIL's and her husband's behaviour without trying to change your own husband's first.\nESH.\n\nETA - tell your kids not to mind the rude man, that you need to put up with him because if not, there won't be any money for them when grandma dies. This way they won't be hurt and will learn a great moral lesson: it's ok to be rude to people as long as they're potentially rewarded with money. /s", "The MIL is a monster and needs a serious reality check. I am hoping your husband eventually comes around and so do his siblings. Everyone indulges this insanity, if all the siblings take a stand, MIL might have to examine what she has done. She doesn't deserve to have her family in her life. Owen sounds just as delusional. Who goes on a family vacation and doesn't acknowledge the people he is with?! \n\nNTA", "What is she protecting her children from?  Being ignored?", "Unless I'm totally reading this wrong, she is upset that Owen doesn't want anything to do with her children.  He is not aggressive towards them, either physically or verbally.   So they are not in any harm.\n\n> Anyway my kids are getting old enough to notice that he ignores all of us. I am worried it will hurt their self esteem or they will internalize bad behavior.\n\nThese are kids that will need a trophy for not winning, so they don't get their feelings hurt.", "According to the post, yes", "Just adding that it\u2019s telling that she\u2019s so happy with a man who refuses to acknowledge her children and grandchildren.  It sounds like her \u201c made up\u201d life is what she\u2019s always wanted.", "Yes, from being treated like they don't exist. And why is this a problem anyways? Owen certainly isn't the one who cares if the grandkids don't show up so OP isn't doing anything to disrespect his boundaries. She just doesn't want to have to make sure that MIL gets to have her cake and eat it, too.", ">MIL gets to have her cake and eat it, too\n\nWhat cake is she getting? \n\n\nThere will be lots of people in those kids lives that will treat them like they don't exist.   They have to learn to just move on.  Owen is not obligated to love them or interact with them just because he loves their grandmother."]}
