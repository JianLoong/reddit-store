He thought she was a psycho? Why does he keep showing up to \u201cstrangers\u201d holidays and sitting there in silence?", "NTA\n\nYou don't need to be around Owen. Your kids don't need to be around Owen. MIL doesn't need to bring Owen to \\_family\\_ gatherings.\n\nOwen doesn't want to be part of the family, so you're entirely justified leaving him out of any family happenings.", "NTA.\n\nWhat you're doing comes down to this: You are not required to set you or your children up for Owen to be rude to you. Being welcoming to guests in your home does not mean that they, or their children, are \"your problem,\" in any meaningful way, so Owen is taking your MIL's promise (which was batshit in the first place) to a strange and distant land by not speaking to people when they come to holidays.\n\nYour MIL made a promise to Owen, but YOU did not. You did not agree to have an ogre travel with you on family vacations. You did not agree that every Christmas morning would involve some dude trying to pretend there were no children on the premises. You did not agree to continue going to MIL's house an infinite number of times so that you could be made to feel incredibly awkward there.\n\nYour MIL's (again: completely batshit) promise has certain costs to keep. One of those costs probably should that your MIL's children and grandchildren will not be hanging out at her house, coming to holidays, or inviting her massively unpleasant partner to their homes. That is what your MIL chose when she chose Owen. If Owen wants to be left alone, fine, but \"being left alone\" is not a thing that comes with dinner invitations.\n\nI don't get why your husband is okay with this situation - it must have really sucked to have your mom decide that her happiness rested on being able to pretend you didn't exist. You are not making drama for no reason, the drama has always been here, and it has been fucking THOROUGHLY repressed by the people at Drama Ground Zero. You are about a mile away from Ground Zero, and your sense of self was not vaporized, so... this is a totally reasonable quantity of drama.

Know what all of us kids at the time did? We steered clear and spent time with the people who showed interest in us. \n\nFurther, the fact that your MIL won\u2019t babysit seems like the real underlying issue and the thing is, just because she\u2019s Gma doesn\u2019t mean she is required to babysit. For all you know, she simply doesn\u2019t want to and is using Owen as an excuse. \n\nOf course spend your time as you wish.

If he doesnt want to have to interact with the rest of the family, then he doesnt need to come. MIL should understand that at least. The fact that she still drags him onto these things and gets butthurt when people confront her is astonishing. I dont even understand why Owen is coming along! It feels like his still bitter about MIL having a family and just wants to ruin it all!??? If he truly didnt care for MILs family he wouldnt be there at all!!!\n\nFor sure, your children deserve to have a grandma who cares for them and steps up from them as well. If MIL cant do that then too bad, guess she wont be seeing the children either.", "NTA - agree with another commenter that suggested that you can't make Owen be kind to your kids but that means that Owen isn't invited and you won't visit MIL if Owen is home. If she wants to have a relationship she can do the traveling and if she chooses to spend holidays with Owen, alone instead of with her kids and grandkids that is her choice. If it means her relationship with her kids and grandkids deteriorates to nonexistent that is also her choice", "Nta, read your posts, read your comments and i have to say this is so incredibly bizarre. \n\nBut of course you are entitled to your boundaries and if Owen wants to pretend you guys dont exist yet refuses to stop attending family gatherings then he definitely knows what he is doing and how it makes you feel and is simply going out of his way to hurt people's feelings.", "Seems like a lose lose situation all around but NTA. Seems like your in laws and husband just put up with this crap.", ">Obviously Owen thought she was an absolute psycho\n\nOwen was right, not that he's much better. Why would you subject your kids to that?\n\nNTA", "unpopular opinion but YTA.\n\nlooks to me like owen didnt marry into the family. he married only ur MIL. which was clear as the agreement was made. hence, he doesn\u2019t owe u anything - yes even interacting w the kids. \n\nur NTA for worrying about ur kids picking up this habit from him. BUT there are other ways to combat this rather than running and crying that he needs to interact w ur kids. ur MIL can come over to visit/go out with u guys without owen. \n\nand lastly \u2728dont force people to do things they dont want to do!!!\u2728", "NTA. Your response of not going places where he will be was the correct one. Your husband has shown that he doesn\u2019t have the spine to stand up to your MIL, so you have to do what you can to protect your kids.", "DIVORCE will make the 'you & grandkids don't exist' real to MILzilla & her creepy husband. Your husband is a joke.\nNTA!!!", "Agreed- also why is MIL mad the kids aren't there if she thinks it's so inappropriate to have them around Owen or unfair to him? Sounds like OP is okay with his boundary by removing the kids entirely from the situation.", "Look out for your kids because your husband's family is dysfunctional and he's probably also got messed up boundaries.", "This Owen guy is honestly one of the weirdest characters I've read about on this sub and I've read....a lot of posts over several years lol. \n\nI ask, as a childfree person, can other childfree people just be normal, wtf \ud83d\ude02", "Brutal. I like the clarification that this was considered harsh enough behavior to justify dueling (and presumably potentially killing) the person doing the cutting.", "My husband and kids wanted to. Owen seemed to have a good time just with MIL and her kids are always going to take a free vacation", "Babysitting is literally not the issue.", "She has dibs on all of the holidays, meaning my kids would miss out on all family celebrations. she is rarely willing to visit without him and she always seems different without him, a little sad and on edge, so my husband refuses as she is easier to deal with when he is around", "The issue is she wouldn't come without him and no one else would come without her. My husband also isn't willing to as he finds her more difficult without Owen around", "> so why doesn\u2019t he just consider you in that light?\n\nI've been told, though idk how much he's actually said, that he hates us and thinks we have hurt MIL but he isn't allowed to talk about it. Allegedly he talks a lot of shit with MILs sister about all three of her kids.", "He just won't speak to her kids or grandkids. He's very close to her sister and BIL and gets along ok with her dad. MIL hosts most of these events so they are at his house. He also knows how co-dependent she is and I think would feel guilty if he wasn't there. He won't talk to us but he does have to calm her down a lot when she begins to get upset.", "The OP above says he only talks to the mom\u2019s sister and such but none of the ADULT CHILDREN OF HIS WIFE.\n(Emphasis just bevsuse that is some BAT SHIT)", "You husband is the biggest asshole and you need to rethink your marriage. He is willing to hurt his children for a situation that his ADULT mother created.\n\nHe is a horrible father and probably shouldn\u2019t be one if he thinks what his mother is subjecting his children to is psychologically okay. Horrible father.", "This is such a weird dynamic. Ive seen alot of post like this where the mom remarries and the partner doesn't like the kids but they don't care cause he means nothing to them. Like......... I get he wants to keep mom happy but like the partner should put in the effort the woman has kids if he's so childfree don't date and marry women with kids", "Imagine if everyone in the family acted this way. Hey hubby, your cousin's new wife isn't really anything to us, I don't think I'll acknowledge her existence when we're around her. Oh, and so-and-so has a boyfriend, but you know, he's not really anything to us, so let's just ignore him too. And your aunt remarried, he's not anything to us, let's pretend he doesn't exist. Actually, here's a list of relatives we deem worthy of our attention.\n\nEveryone would think it was shitty behavior if you did this. Why your husband, and apparently others, give this AH a pass is beyond me. It's ridiculous behavior whether it's your family or his. Just weird toxic family dynamics.", "New rule: when visiting MIL home, Owen stays in the bedroom.  When MIL is visiting you Owen stays in the car. Deal acknowledged.", "Ok, so the only one being bothered by the whole situation is you?\n\nYour MIL was TA once when she liked about having children and cheating on her husband.\nBUT everything afterwards are NAH situations. It was clear from the beginning that Owen didn't want anything to to with anyone bit your MIL.\nYou and your family are benefiting with freebies while only having to endure someone that is only ignoring them. I don't see any harm being done there.\nYou can still choose to only meet her alone or (as you already did) just stay home.", "Yeah that\u2019s though. It\u2019s not good for the kids to miss out and at the same time it sucks for them to be subjected to someone like Owen. Like I honestly don\u2019t know which is worse. But you are definitely NOT the AH here. I hope you guys can work it out", "Who is the \"no one else would come without her\"? Your husband's siblings and their children (the cousins) who are also being openly ignored by Owen? Why wouldn't anyone show up without MIL and asshole Owen?\n\nIf MIL's children are kowtowing to her because she has money (as her ex seems to be indifferent to her husband's behavior toward their children/grandchildren) I think her kids are in for a BIG unpleasant surprise in the future. If MIL pretended her kids didn't exist to \"get\" Owen, and is fine with him pretending her descendants don't exist now, it's very probable that Owen, and Owen alone, will inherit your MIL's estate.\n\nI have no idea what value MIL's children see in continuing a relationship with their mother who, by all accounts, would be happier/just fine if she didn't have them. However, family dysfunction like this always has its inexplicable manifestations, and one of them seems to be children who cannot break emotionally free from toxic parents, even when they recognize it. \n\nOP should keep herself and her kids far away from this. The kids not seeing their cousins is least negative outcome of an overall bad situation. Who wants to remember a childhood where step-grandpa *never* acknowledged any of grandma's kids or grandkids, and grandma was OK with that? It would much more long-term damaging than not being able to see your cousins. This family is insane.", "Well sometimes as a adult you have to be around people you would rather not and be nice to them. This behavior is like when a 5 year old gets mad and refuses to look at their mom or dad.", "He views himself as a victim since she lied until he was in love with her and then it was too hard to break it off. I guess this is the only way to make it fair in his eyes because he is always claiming he didn't sign up for this", "\u201cWhat\u2019s this? An abandoned house that happens to have a cooked dinner inside? Must be my lucky day!\u201d", "Gmta. I was wondering if this was before OP got married.  If yes, OP is TA for assuming this would change.", "My two SILs are very financially dependent on her. Then her sister is 100% team Owen and her kids wouldn't disobey her by coming", "Why do you need to see this woman at all?", "LOL the way to make it fair is getting out of the relationship. The fact that she lied for that long and he didn't relize that says alot about their relationship. \n\nYou didnt do anything wrong you just made him more comfortable.", "because it is important to my husband and they are his kids as well. Also I don't want my kids missing out on all the family stuff with their cousins", "So yeah this is why your husband has no spine. Mommy still pays", "Now I get it. NTA Btw. The reason no one says anything is all about future inheritances IMO.  This is so bizzaro!", "So, your husband sold his spine. And you need to either agree with it, or have your husband get very upset at you for potentially destroying his payday.", "What a family!", "Also the reason Owen is around \ud83e\udd2d"]}
