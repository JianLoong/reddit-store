He thought she was a psycho? Why does he keep showing up to \u201cstrangers\u201d holidays and sitting there in silence?", "NTA\n\nYou don't need to be around Owen. Your kids don't need to be around Owen. MIL doesn't need to bring Owen to \\_family\\_ gatherings.\n\nOwen doesn't want to be part of the family, so you're entirely justified leaving him out of any family happenings.", "NTA.\n\nWhat you're doing comes down to this: You are not required to set you or your children up for Owen to be rude to you. Being welcoming to guests in your home does not mean that they, or their children, are \"your problem,\" in any meaningful way, so Owen is taking your MIL's promise (which was batshit in the first place) to a strange and distant land by not speaking to people when they come to holidays.\n\nYour MIL made a promise to Owen, but YOU did not. You did not agree to have an ogre travel with you on family vacations. You did not agree that every Christmas morning would involve some dude trying to pretend there were no children on the premises. You did not agree to continue going to MIL's house an infinite number of times so that you could be made to feel incredibly awkward there.\n\nYour MIL's (again: completely batshit) promise has certain costs to keep. One of those costs probably should that your MIL's children and grandchildren will not be hanging out at her house, coming to holidays, or inviting her massively unpleasant partner to their homes. That is what your MIL chose when she chose Owen. If Owen wants to be left alone, fine, but \"being left alone\" is not a thing that comes with dinner invitations.\n\nI don't get why your husband is okay with this situation - it must have really sucked to have your mom decide that her happiness rested on being able to pretend you didn't exist. You are not making drama for no reason, the drama has always been here, and it has been fucking THOROUGHLY repressed by the people at Drama Ground Zero. You are about a mile away from Ground Zero, and your sense of self was not vaporized, so... this is a totally reasonable quantity of drama.

Know what all of us kids at the time did? We steered clear and spent time with the people who showed interest in us. \n\nFurther, the fact that your MIL won\u2019t babysit seems like the real underlying issue and the thing is, just because she\u2019s Gma doesn\u2019t mean she is required to babysit. For all you know, she simply doesn\u2019t want to and is using Owen as an excuse. \n\nOf course spend your time as you wish.

If 1 adult thinks that is crazy and would rather not bother attending the event\u2026 sounds reasonable to me.\n\nWhere I think that you are TA is allowing this person to come to your events. If he doesn\u2019t want to interact with the family, don\u2019t allow him to pull a power play. Rescind his invitation. All his presence does is add unnecessary drama.", "NTA. Owen is an AH and MIL is prioritising him over her kids & grandkids. Which is her prerogative but comes with consequences.", "NTA, but you should give up on any notion of MIL being an attentive grandma.\n\nSounds like MIL is living out a long cherished fantasy about being childfree, and she's using Owen as a facilutator for that fantasy lifestyle. You can't guilt or shame her out of that.", "NTA. If she really wants to go have another life then she should go have it and stop trying to live two lives where one of them pretends the other doesn\u2019t exist.", ">  she promised the kids would never be his problem and he wouldn't have to have anything to do with them.\n\nOwen and MIL got married and he just pretends her family doesn't exist. We see him occasionally and he comes to holidays, but he doesn't speak to any of us or acknowledge us.\n\nSo does he want to be part of the family or not? If he pretend the family don't exist, then no family gathering. \nIf he comes anyway, the minimum is to be polite and acknowledge you exist. \nNTA", "NTA. \n\nHe wants to pretend like you don't exist. She wants to let him. Then you don't exist to them. Go NC or as LC as your husband will allow. I wouldn't ever be seen with them or let them come to my house again.", "NTA \n\nI think the obvious solution is to stay away. MIL sounds like a toxic piece of work. She wants to have her cake and eat it too. Life rarely works like that. \n\nStay far away.", "You should probably bring this up with Owen and say you don't want him over anymore. Not to vacations or to your house because he isn't your family. You don't have to put up with him. Same with MIL.\n\nNTA", "X\nSafe poop poop p pop p pop p", "NTA\nThis all sounds totally happy and normal, right Owen?  Owen, Owen?!", "NTA", "NTA if he wants to act like she has no family he should not benefit from family functions, should have no interaction with her children or her grand children. this is a choice that he made and one that she agreed to. therefore she should attend and host family functions without the one person who clearly has not interest in being family. this is on her, not you.", "MIL chose some rando over her grandchildren. \n\nNTA", "NTA. Their agreement is their agreement. You don\u2019t have to like it or be around it.", "what a weird situation", "NTA - although I have to say, I wouldn\u2019t be too bothered about Owen not talking to your kids. They probably don\u2019t care about him at all, when it has always been like that. \nI grew up with my uncle being married to a woman who didn\u2019t like children and she was at every family gathering, I didn\u2019t even notice her until I was like 10 or so and I never cared about her, she was just there. As long as Owen only ignores them and isn\u2019t mean to them or tells them off all the time, it should be fine.", "NTA, I despise people who put their partners above their children in such ways. I had a parent like that growing up and even though things are different now I still feel hurt.", "op=NTA\n\nThat is an insane ask.  Go to visit someone who treats you(plural) like you don't exist. Nope.  If MIL wants to see kids, she can come to your house(she can babysit there too--if she wants to spend extra time with grandkids) or she can meet up at places where Owen is not.\n\nYour husband is rude to demand your kids be treated like that.  You, however, as an adult can regulate your emotions and live with Owen \"ignoring\" you.", "NTA. Just cut them both off. You don\u2019t need your kids to be around that toxicity.", "Owen was right about one thing your mil psycho", "NTA, why does he attend family gatherings if he's pretending her family doesn't exist?", "NTA. You don't need that in your kids life. Also, if your kids are old enough to start internalizing Owen's behavior, you should sit them down and have a talk with them about it. By giving them context, will help them recognize and understand bad behavior as opposed to leaving them to figure it out on their own.", "YTA. You and your kids aren\u2019t entitled to Owens\u2019s attention \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f He isn\u2019t insulting you are doing anything hostile, he just does doesn\u2019t interact with you.", "I agree. Cut him out of your lives. How he acts towards you guys is absolutely disgusting. You're adults and he can't even be bothered to acknowledge you being near him. \n\nIn fact, the fact that he did that to you to begin with when you were possibly minors is dispicable. \nChild free fine. But that doesn't mean no manners and acting as of children don't exist.\n\nHe married a woman with kids. The fact he wasn't responsible for the kids is fine. But to ignore them for the rest of their lives is ridiculous. \n\nNTA.", "Yes he went. MIL is rarely willing to come without Owen and it\u2019s a huge sore spot for my husband because he claims I don\u2019t know how she used to be and I don\u2019t want to see that side of her as she seemingly can\u2019t self regulate without owen", "That is literally what OP did and MIL is pissed at her.", "Apparently before she met him she was completely out of control and the kids dreaded her being home from work. I know she self harmed and apparently had a nasty temper. She hated being a mother and felt trapped. She also created a vicious cycle because she felt like they only saw her as a paycheck but really the only thing she could do well wasprovide", "She desperately regrets her kids and he gave her the chance to pretend it never happened. The only family member she actually loves, in my opinion, is her sister and Owens close to her", "She didn\u2019t tell them until they were older when she begged the girls to consider not having kids but it was pretty obvious as she was self harming in front of them", "He apparently really hates them. This is all hear say but apparently he talks a lot of shit to MILs sister about how we make his skin crawl, how he feels we abused MIL", "He hasn\u2019t seen it but Owen always claims he doesn\u2019t want her money as people wanting her money is a huge sore spot (and he\u2019s filthy rich) and MIL claims she is giving it to her kids because she knows she failed to raise them and worries about them being homeless. Her lawyer is top notch", "I wish your other in-laws would do the same if they too have kids.", "It\u2019s important to her and he gets along with the rest of the family", "Her kids are adults now, with their own children, and he still won't talk to them? I think what the person you're responding to meant is: *he* thought that *she* was psycho???!?", "I don\u2019t but I can\u2019t make the decision entirely on my own. My husband wants co tact and my kids desperately want to go to family things", "I thought this too", "He\u2019s richer than she is", "There is always malicious compliance.\n\nIf The kids don't exist to Owen, then Owen doesn't exist to them?\n\nNot sure how old your kids are, but if someone doesn't exist, then you can't \"bump\" into them....You can't hit them with the beach ball... whatever.", "I can sorta see not wanting to be a part of the family, however not being a part of the family, yet being around the family is weird as fu*k. Your husband maybe your MIL\u2019s child, but he and you are adults, does Owen not interact with you? If so that\u2019s disrespectful as fu*k. Women who put having a man over their children, are a \u2018special\u2019 breed.", "I\u2019m going to say between you and Owen, N A H. Your MIL though is a massive AH. \n\nWho the actual fuck lies about being married with kids like that? I don\u2019t give a rats ass if she was depressed and wanted to play pretend. She was manipulative from the beginning.\n\nOwen doesn\u2019t want to be around or hang out with kids. He doesn\u2019t have to. If he was intentionally being mean to them, calling them names, etc., that would be rude, but simply not wanting to engage with them isn\u2019t. Not everyone likes kids. \n\nYou also dont want to be around someone who doesn\u2019t want to engage with you and your kids, and that\u2019s fine too. You have  every right to stay home if you don\u2019t want to see him. \n\nYour MIL sounds awful.", "NTA. It's unbelievable what lengths some people will go to keep a partner by their side, even when they are complete AHs.", "NTA. He doesn't want to be part of the family, your family doesn't need to be subjected to him. Your mil can come around is she wants to be part of your lives, without him.", "Kinda TA\u2026and allow me to explain my position. Your mil made an agreement to be with Owen and is happy with him. Is he going to the extreme by ignoring you all? Definitely, but you didn\u2019t ask us if he was TA. Your children will meet people throughout their lives that are rude, mean, insufferable, self centered, etc.  While I understand wanting to protect them, you aren\u2019t doing them any favors by shielding them and asking mil to change. Explain to your kids, in age appropriate terms, that Owen isn\u2019t like other, friendlier people\u2026he prefers to be left alone. That all they ever need to do is give a polite hello/goodbye and go about their day. That not everyone likes everyone and that is okay. The important thing is to be kind and respect other people while not allowing themselves to be walked on or feel hurt because someone doesn\u2019t like them.", "NTA\u2026 But there is a great opportunity for petty revenge. Just make fun of Owen all the time. Go to events and be an noxious, snarky, crafty. Teach you kids to pretend he\u2019s a ghost who can\u2019t talk to them.  Owen sounds like a capital A.", "NTA. Owen doesn\u2019t need to look after your kids, but to completely ignore you and them is just damn rude.", "Owen is such a child himself, how can he stand to be around himself?! NTA!", "NTA I wouldn't want to be around him. Mil can come visit alone", "Why would Owen be at family gatherings when he so clearly doesn't want to be part of the family?\n\nAnd what kind of AH can go on holiday and just pretend the other people doesn't exist?\n\nYou're NTA, but your husband needs to grow a spine. It's not normal to just ignore people and pretend children doesn't exist because it's an \"inconvenience\".", "NTA. If it was me I\u2019d completely remove myself and my kids from MILs life. If she can\u2019t watch them and all of y\u2019all\u2019s relationship is catered to her and owens needs that\u2019s just not fair.", "Yeah, tbh it doesn\u2019t sound like he wants to be there at all. He\u2019s only going because MIL is dragging him there, and I bet she\u2019s hoping to chip away at their agreement and frog-in-boiling-water him into interacting more with her kids, while he\u2019s on high alert because he suspects if he interacts with the kids MIL will try and manoeuvre him more into breaking their agreement.\n\nMIL made a deal with the devil and needs to start paying the price. She can live her ideal childfree marriage with Owen, and have her family completely separate. She cannot have both. She made that choice when she manipulated a man who made his feelings clear on kids into a relationship, and made him a promise that was insane to make. Now she gets to live the life she chose", "And OP is actually doing her part in honouring MILs agreement to Owen.\n\nHe wants to be seperate from MILs family life and let\u2019s face it, is only at events because MIL cajoled him into going. OPs insisting on her keeping her promise to him by not having him interact with the wider family. He\u2019ll probably have the time of his life going fishing with the boys while she\u2019s away", "Because mil isn't real and this is part of the weird mil troll bs but focused on the \"uwu my mom is happy with this man who hates her kids!!! Why are u being so dramatic she's happy that's what matters!!!\" aspect", "He's ok with mom pretending neither he or his family exist for some dude's sake, only because *if she's unhappy she's unpleasant*.\n\nMil was toxic before Owen, poor guy this woman must suck as a mom.\n\nHe should grow the f up and remove his family of this toxic woman and the ogre she decided to marry.", "Just wondering if he does the same with his own family now. I know there has to be at least one or two kids around", "Yup - 100% agree.", "THIS IS THE WAY.", "Which will get the reaction, \"No, I'm not getting involved in you and Mil's fight. Stop trying to cause drama.\"", "Because they won't risk being cut off by going along with OP's attempt at a power play."]}
