I was employed at a mid sized grocery for 3 years and 2 days ago was the final straw. We had been short staffed for several months, on my team there were supposed to be 7 employees and we only maintained 4. We would hire workers but they wouldn't work out for one reason or another, so we were consistently at 4 employees. With this, we had to constantly stay later than scheduled to make sure the job got done. Upper management would be pissed that we stayed late and also pissed if we didn't finish so we were always in trouble.\n\nTwo weeks ago they hired a new guy, Bob and at first he seemed pretty decent. I started to notice little things he was doing wrong (like stocking stuff crooked or in the wrong spot). Ordinarily I wouldn't have cared but part of my job involved working after him so it would take me longer to do my job because I had to fix his mistakes. I informed my manager(James) that he needed to work with this guy and train him better. .. that didn't happen.\n\nTo be more clear about the job: we get a truck and stock every other day. In between truck/stock days one of the crew straightens up the store... usually it's me. So I end up seeing and fixing whatever things the other guys screw up.\n\nLast Monday, James tells me that the store manager isn't happy that I'm staying late on the off truck days. He says it's wasting the budget and I need to leave on time. I take him to one of the aisles that Bob works and show him  several sections that are slowing me down and explain to him that the store manager would flip if he saw it... so does he want me to fix it or not. I tell him if he trains Bob better then I can leave on time. He agreed that it couldn't be left unfixed and said he would talk to Bob. Again, that didn't happen. Bob kept doing what he had been doing, so the next two off truck days\"(Tues & Thurs) I didn't fix it and left on time.\n\nWhen I got to work Saturday, I get a verbal write up for the things I didn't fix because the store wasn't in good condition. I stayed and made sure the store was good and ended up leaving later than scheduled,\n\nMonday when I get to work I get called into the store manager's office and written up again(James wasn't there). This time for \"wasting payroll\" for staying late on Saturday. He goes on about how I was warned, how it shouldn't take that long to straighten the shelves. I let him say all he had to say and then I told him he could find someone else to do it and went home.\n\nNow James has been texting me asking me what happened and asking me to come back. He says that he explained to the store manager why I was taking so long and he said I could come back because \"we're so understaffed\", \"the crew needs me\" and I \"shouldn't be without a job at Christmas time\"\n\nEDIT: Thanks to all who wish me well in finding another job.
