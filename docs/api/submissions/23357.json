{"id": 23357, "submission_id": "15c70s9", "title": "AITA For having my neighbor's car towed and causing her to lose her job?", "selftext": "About a year ago a new neighbor moved in next to me. She does not have a driveway and I do, so she has to park her car on the street. Occasionally, I would see her car parked in front of my driveway. Usually I would just park on the street and not say anything, or I would go and ask her to move her car. This went on for a few months, and she eventually got a parking ticket for parking in front of my driveway and stopped blocking my driveway entirely.   \nIn May, my neighbor was parking her car in front of my driveway again. I asked her again to please not block my driveway. She said she would make no promises because she didn't know how to park on the street. I told her that she needed to learn how to park better because she lived in a neighborhood where that was the only option for most people, and that it wasn't my problem that she didn't know how to parallel park. She got extremely angry and all of the good will between us stopped after that argument. At the beginning of July, she started a new job where she had to work nights, and our schedules were now totally opposite of one another. I would come home and her car would always blocking my driveway, and when I went to leave for work in the morning her car would always be blocking my driveway. After about a week of not being able to access our driveway, I asked my husband and he said it would be best to just let it be because working nights is stressful and she's probably under a lot of stress having starting a new job.  \nI didn't agree with this, but I kept my cool. About two weeks ago, I got home from a bad day of work very angry and decided to do something about it. I called the police and let them know that someone was blocking my driveway. They said they would send out a tow truck to have the car moved. The tow truck driver began to pick up the car, and as this was happening my neighbor ran out screaming and begging with the tow truck driver to not take it because she would lose her job. I felt no regret. She was doing something illegal and had already got a ticket for this once before, she had her warning. The tow truck driver just told her it would be $800 to pick up the car from the city lot. This whole time she was saying some pretty mean things to me, calling me names, calling my husband names, and threatening us. I have not seen the car on the street ever since.  \nA few days ago, I saw her outside and she began screaming at me telling me that she lost her job. I said that I was sorry for what happened, but that it was her fault for blocking my driveway. My husband and I talked about it, and he said that while he was on my side he felt that I was an asshole for getting her car towed and making her lose her job, and that we should at least pay her the $800 to get her car back. I'm not sure if they added on extra fees for storing the car for this long now, and I don't think we should pay her anything, because I had already tried being nice once before and it didn't work out.

The neighbour is victim to the consequences of her own actions. Stupid games and prizes and all that...", ">I would have supported keying her car or something else that might make her angry, but not making her lose her job.\n\nIncredibly absurd take. You'd rather have OP commit a crime than call the police?\n\nOP didn't make her neighbor lose her job. She lost her job because she is an ignorant asshole. You reap what you sow.", "OP didn't make her lose her job. The consequences of her OWN actions did. And OP could have been arrested for vandalizing her car. What ridiculous advice.", "neighbor caused those consequences herself. she was warned multiple times to stop blocking their driveway and instead of learning how to park on the street she continued doing something she was told not to do. op is NTA", "What, someone called a tow truck? - the only correct answer op should've said \n\nOp didn't call a tow truck", "Are you the one who blocked the driveway? Because you seem to share the same disillusionment as the d*ck who couldn't learn how to park.\n\nIf someone doesn't want to deal with the consequences of breaking the law, which often has monetary ramifications, then they should probably just ... abide by the law? It's not OP's problem this person can't figure out legit parking.", "So why shouldn't he be able to use his driveway? That women being unable to park correctly shouldn't be her fault. Seems to me she should have learned to park correctly. She asked many times for not block her driveway and she did anyway", "Are you joking? The neighbor is facing the consequences of her own behavior. Don't want tickets or your car towed? Then don't block someone else's driveway.", "The is classic FAFO. OP asked the neighbor to stop illegally parking and blocking her driveway. Neighbor refused. Neighbor now gets to deal with this crazy new thing called *consequences*", "While Reddit have most definitely upped my suspicions I would have come to this conclusion even before joining Reddit.", "If the neighbor is the other woman, that explains why she keeps blocking OP on purpose.", "I moved to a place with street parking about 2 years ago, and did the same thing. I had someone show me, watched a YouTube video, and then just practiced doing it, and now I can parallel park with no issues. \n\nIf OP's neighbor is going to live in a place that only has street parking, the burden is really on them to learn. They don't get to block driveways just because they're lazy.\n\nIf they genuinely have issues with it, I'm sure there are places where they can take driving courses that cover parallel parking with a qualified instructor, and I'm certain that course would be less than the cost of retrieving the car from a tow company (plus the tickets).", "I literally learned to parallel park the night before my drivers test and I\u2019ve never had an issue with parallel parking. If she doesn\u2019t feel like she can learn on her own he can have a friend help out for an hour. I\u2019ve taught like 5 people how to parallel park or how to get better at it. It\u2019s just laziness and entitlement at this point", "Do you know how many bad neighbor story end in property destruction or worse? A lot! I\u2019m willing to say he\u2019s probably thinking about that more than he\u2019s fucking or thinking about fucking the neighbor.", "That\u2019s true but her not being able to parallel park shouldn\u2019t turn into her problem. She should have found a place to park where there was no parallel parking, even if it\u2019s down a couple streets.", "Then she must do without cement!\nShe can throw some thin wooden boards\n\nOr she can just park her car on the ground..\u2026..   I don't care \u2026\u2026Just she stays out of the OP's driveway", "She also didn\u2019t care if her car prevented the OP from getting to work, and potentially leading to OP getting fired.", "Exactly", "That\u2019s why you invest in a good security camera system with sound. Which is a better place to invest the money.\n\nThen if she is stupid enough to do anything send her to jail! She will eventually learn. Play stupid games win stupid prizes!", "100% agree with you. She could have someone teach her, but she did not. She's a class A jerk, and found out what happens.", "The threat of prison hasn\u2019t stopped people before, so why would it stop her?! There\u2019s so many escalating bad neighbor stories starting at arguments leading to property destruction and final physical violence(possibly death). \n\nOP is right, but I can understand where the husband is coming from trying to keep it from escalating more. I\u2019ll say this\u2026if we\u2019ve seen anything from recent videos of neighbors or random people, it doesn\u2019t take much for people to snap and become physical violent.", "So the only safe option is to give into the bad neighbors?", "No placating people like the neighbor isn\u2019t the answer! \n\nWhen they think they can manipulate and bully you they don\u2019t stop.\n\nStories like this make me glad I live on about 100 acres in the middle of no where!", "No, I\u2019m not saying that. **LET ME BE CLEAR\u2026I SAID OP WAS RIGHT**. I just said I get why her husband didn\u2019t want to escalate it further. At this point, I\u2019d tell OP to complete stop engaging.", "It\u2019s crazy how I said **OP was right\u2026.** Just don\u2019t get caught up in a game of who can one up the other person because that\u2019s when it gets dangerous.\n\n**EITHER WAY\u2026LET ME REPEAT THAT OP IS RIGHT FOR GETTING HER CAR TOWED.** There\u2019s two reason why I brought up potential escalation because it does happen pretty often and to say he probably doesn\u2019t want to fuck the neighbor unlike many here will say", "I understand what you mean. It is a shame you have to think that and people have to worry about this kind of issue.\n\nThat\u2019s why I am glad I live where I do! I could not stand to live in a place where you have to deal with worrying about people destroying your property.", "Don\u2019t get me wrong, my neighbors are hella chill. But I have seen neighbors who\u2019s been complete assholes. Additionally, with me being black I do have to watch how I interact with certain people because escalation can lead to some bas circumstances for me and my friends."]}
