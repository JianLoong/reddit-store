She doesn't overdress but she never wears any casual clothing. She always wears makeup and gets her hair and nails done regularly. Annie showed up briefly at the group once, and once she'd gone I had a couple of them ask me if I'm \"pressuring\" Annie about her appearance after she's given birth and is stressed with work and the baby. I wasn't happy with this. While I respect the effort Annie makes with her appearance, I absolutely do not pressure her to make the amount of effort she does, and she's been dressing this way long before we met. I told her what they said but she didn't mind, and said they were \"just concerned.\" \n\nAlso, a couple of times they've \"inquired\" about how much I do around the house, whether I'm doing enough for the baby, and that they \"hope I'm not making Annie have to do more after work\". None of the women have been asked these questions. \n\nI was doing some shopping yesterday when I bumped into one of the ladies. It's been a while since the last meeting so I asked when we would be meeting up again. She said she'd check the groupchat. I'm not on the chat and didn't know there was one. She told me who the admin was, and I texted her later to ask if I could be added just so I could be kept in the loop. The response I got was \"It's more of a mum's thing\" but she said she would like to add Annie. \n\nI spoke to Annie about this when she got home, and told her that while she can do what she wants, I don't want anything to do with these people. They're judgmental, rude, sexist snobs. Annie said that was a bit harsh and that it was probably just \"differences of opinion gone too far\". I told her they were pr*cks, which upset her because she feels a \"kinship\" to them because they \"shared\" each other's pregnancies. \n\nI'm sorry but these are nasty human beings. I get that we're all tired and stressed with our babies, but I've been treated with utter contempt since I started going to these things without Annie. If Annie wants to keep in touch with them when she has the time that's fine by me, but I'm not going to be involved.", "created_utc": 1684508728, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13ly513/aita_for_telling_my_wife_that_her_friends_are/", "score": 364, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He is an incredible father and fills that role much better than I could. \n\nI have a real problem with the gate keeping moms groups do when it comes to Dads who are in a similar situation as them. \n\nThat being said, you should and an open sage talk with your wife and make sure she doesn\u2019t actually feel that pressure weather from you or elsewhere, also have the conversation about how she feels about your contribution and make sure you are on the same page. The only reason I say that is because if any of my friends were to talk to my husband like that, and say things about him like that, I\u2019d be pretty damn upset at them and I would not brush it off to him. But if I were complaining to them about that kind of thing, then I might say something like \u201coh they\u2019re just concerned.\u201d\n\nAlso the friends might just be projecting their own experiences with their own husbands ms", "NTA. My husband was a SAHD for 5 years, and even his siblings called him my housewife.

Clearly, it was a little bit harsh in the wording, but you were frustrated and didn't feel like your wife was completely hearing you and being supportive the way you were hoping. It does sound like the group isn't a good fit for you and that they are being sexist by consistently making assumptions about you and your family dynamic based on antiquated stereotypes, so I understand you not wanting to be around them. \n\nI do understand where your wife is coming from to a certain extent in terms of them going through the pregnancies together and forming a bond over it but honestly, if they're treating you poorly she should be more concerned with that than with keeping up appearances in a group that would so quickly dismiss her husband. You're the one home with the child and most likely need that \"village\" support from people going through the same thing but they seem quick to push you out and that's a real shame on both sides; they're missing out on a different perspective as well as keeping that community from someone who could use it because of their own close-mindedness.\n\nSorry you're going through that and hopefully your wife will come to understand and be more supportive and I hope you can find another group nearby that offers you the support you deserve.", "Wow.  Is \"toxic femininity\" a thing?  Because it seems to be with these gals.  You are NTA.

Agree with those who've said they all just sound jealous. I'd stay away from them and seek out other parents maybe in your neighborhood or local area with young kids instead.", "NTA \n\nThey're judgemental and probably jealous of your wife. Ask your wife why she needs to hang out with them first.", "Seems to me they could have said this to your face at the last meeting you attended if that is how they felt instead of being cowardly about it all.  I would be glad not to be around people who believe you control, pressure, persuade, or abuse your wife in some way.  I'm surprised your wife isn't standing by you more than she is, but that is her choice.  I agree with your assessment of them.

I hope You're telling the whole truth because I seem to be going against popular opinion here so far in saying NTA.", "So what\u2019s the actual issue here?

You guys aren\u2019t meant to be friends. I don\u2019t really think they\u2019re the pricks you think they are though, but that\u2019s simply a matter of personal opinion.", "Nta. Let's say that you and your wife were in an engineering group. You went inactive, while she remained active. The men in said group don't respect her work; they create a group chat without her; they constantly question her abilities; and even reach out to you so that you can \"double check her work for mistakes\". She complains to you, and you brush her off by saying that you and the group bonded over a mutual project; so you know they weren't malicious.  Would your wife be okay with that? Probably not. \n\nThen your wife takes this problem to reddit. Like the responses you're reading here, the people here are calling her out for complaining, citing that, historically, women aren't as good at math and science as men. Also, there aren't many women engineers, so your wife needs to understand why she's getting disrespected and shunned. \n\nThat's what's going on with you. You are a victim of sexism. Don't let these nasty broads try to convince you otherwise.", "NTA. It looks like an FDS group is slowly adopting your wife.", "[deleted]", "No judgement. It does not sound like there is a conflict here. \n\nThey pretty obviously want to hang out with you just as much as you want to hang out with them. Your wife is not saying you have to maintain contact. You are not saying that your wife can't maintain contact.\n\nWhere is the conflict?", "ESH. it sounds like a group that is concerned about your woman's well-being.

Thousands of women are pressured every day to get back in shape immediately after pregnancy, thousands support husbands and still take care of the house. Your situation is different. OK. you are a rare case. Explain that. Doesn't hurt.", "So...soft ESH. You absolutely have a right to equitable, respectful treatment and mutually supportive relationships. And you don't have to have anything to do with these women and their judgements. You also deserve empathy from your spouse when people are treating you in such a nasty way. Your spouse hasn't shared your experience so is having a hard time wrapping her head around your harsh words. She's coming off as lacking empathy because you're coming off as attacking people whose nice sides are the only sides she's seen. You both would be better off getting out of your heads and into your hearts: talk about the way *you felt* when you were having those interactions with those women. Then clear your life of contact with them and focus on your own family and lives. \n\nSorry you have had to deal with this crappy behavior on top of all the changes to do with having a baby.  Rooting for you. Enjoy the baby, and all the best.", "YTA. I'm not... Really sure what's your issue here. Probably a lot of these women have experienced their partners or seen others not pulling their weight. This tends to be more common with male partners due to ingrained sexism. And it seems to have become a women's group, which kinda sucks but... The level of anger seems disproportionate.

If Annie was the stay at home parent and a group of men asked her if she was doing enough around the house, and said they hoped she wasn't making more work for her husband when he got home?  In fact, people have said this to women throughout most of history and feminists have been working for decades to end this kind of disgusting attitude. \n\nYes mothers have been devalued, disrespected, shamed, belittled etc. since the dawn of time.

They are definitely AH.", "BS\n\nIf the genders were swapped here you'd be all over these people. This is a great father being prejudged by assholes", "I think his reasoning is he's being singled out of the group because he's not a woman. The only reason they don't want him there is because he's not a mom.

Not in any particularly accurate way but it's still an issue.", "none of that makes it okay to be treating op like shit just because he's a man.", "so because they probably have partners who suck and decided to be assholes to op and he's not happy with it, he's an asshole? get out of here with that nonsense.", "[removed]", "One of my good friends is getting back in to playing hockey after her first pregnancy 8 years ago.

I would have walked away, but I was taking a drink break after doing a few hours of work around the house, including an oil change on my motorcycle. At that point I just wanted to see how much material he could come up with. 45-minutes was impressive. I had some good follow-up questions that I can't remember. I think one of them was what to do if I'm working from my back and everything is upside down. Sometimes it amazes me that we figured out how to have a baby in the first place...", "That shit infuriates me.

There is no conflict here. Not everyone is meant to be friends.", "And that\u2019s fine. OP is allowed to dislike them. But if he doesn\u2019t care if his wife is still friends with them, there isn\u2019t a conflict. Depending on where OP lives, there are probably other SAHP or even SAHD groups he could join. Not everyone is always going to get along. These women don\u2019t have to like OP.

You can't twist every situation into being about how women are the victims", "You didn\u2019t officially vote, but you were defending them saying they weren\u2019t pricks. Calling someone a prick is basically calling someone an AH, jerk, or dick etc. by your writing, it sounds like you don\u2019t think these people did anything wrong, which they clearly were being judgmental jerks. \n\nAlso, even though it kinda seems like this situation has come to a resolution, there definitely is conflict. \n\n1st conflict: OP vs these \u201cfriends\u201d. OP is looking for us to back him up and reassure him that these people suck since his wife thinks he is overreacting \n\n2nd conflict OP vs wife: OPs wife isn\u2019t backing him up and minimizing the hurt that her friends are causing on her husband\n\n3rd conflict: OP doesn\u2019t want to be around the \u201cfriends\u201d: this seems to be the conflict you are focusing on. While true, it kinda came to a close with OP saying his wife can go without him, we don\u2019t know if Annie is going to agree to that. She may still tell him he\u2019s overreacting. We don\u2019t know. Even if she agrees, this isn\u2019t a great compromise because she\u2019s keeping these toxic people his life by keeping them in her life. Even if this compromise works out, it still doesn\u2019t erase the other two conflicts I mentioned. \n\nAlso just because a conflict has come to a resolution in the post, doesn\u2019t mean we can\u2019t give judgement on who was the AH.", "The conflict is his wife's lack of support. She shouldn't want to be around people who think so low of her spouse", "And all that excuses the sexism? That's the conflict, he's had a bad experience and his wife is downplaying it.....", "There isn\u2019t a conflict if OP is fine with her still being friends with them. OP\u2019s actual query was whether or not he was an asshole for calling them pricks. He\u2019s entitled to his opinion, so no he\u2019s not. The rest of it is irrelevant. Whatever the reason these women don\u2019t like him (maybe they\u2019re all super sexist, maybe their husbands aren\u2019t pulling their weight and they\u2019re projecting, maybe OP\u2019s wife made a comment in the past and now they think ill of OP\u2014 we don\u2019t know anything other than they dislike OP and he dislikes them), this group of people isn\u2019t meant to be friends with OP and vice versa.\n\nOP did not ask if his wife was an asshole for still wanting to be friends with these people. He\u2019s actively encouraging it. AITA for having an opinion is not an actual conflict.", "That\u2019s still not a conflict. OP told her he was fine with it. If he doesn\u2019t have an issue with it, that\u2019s not a problem. It\u2019s not like he said stop being friends with these horrid people and she said no way. He said I\u2019m fine with you continuing to be friends with these people, but I don\u2019t want to be.", "He told her he didn\u2019t care if she maintains friendships with these people. If he does not care, why would she? The only disagreement here is she doesn\u2019t think they are pricks. They probably haven\u2019t been to her. And quite honestly the fact that they all just randomly decided OP was horrible despite all evidence to the contrary makes me think perhaps OP\u2019s wife made some sort of comment in the past. I suppose it\u2019s possible a random group of women all decided that OP wasn\u2019t cutting it in the dad department and being a chauvinist, but it\u2019s not particularly probable.\n\nI still don\u2019t think there is a conflict here. OP can think these women suck, but if he isn\u2019t going to have a problem with the wife maintaining a relationship with them, there\u2019s nothing else to be done. She\u2019s entitled to her opinion too, and it would be really odd for that opinion to be that they suck if he expects her to continue being friends with them.\n\nEdit: typo", "And again this excuses the sexism?", "No, but that doesn\u2019t really matter. If they\u2019re sexist, they\u2019re sexist. No one is able to force these women to think better of OP. If you want me to say OP\u2019s wife is an asshole because she\u2019s choosing to be friends with these people still, I\u2019m not going to because I never voted in the first place. If OP tells his wife that it\u2019s fine to maintain her friendship with them, that\u2019s between them. OP is entitled to his opinion about these women, but at the end of the day, this isn\u2019t a conflict for AITA.", "A not supporting a spouse on the receiving end of sexism isn't a topic for AITA?", "That isn\u2019t what OP asked. OP\u2019s query was is he an asshole for calling these people pricks, not is my wife an asshole for disagreeing with my opinion of her friends."]}
