{"id": 17653, "submission_id": "13ly513", "title": "AITA for telling my wife that her \"friends\" are judgmental pr*cks?", "selftext": "When my wife Annie was pregnant, we were part of an antenatal group. Most of the women there are either on maternity leave or have left their jobs since having their babies. Annie is a senior engineer and I'm a primary school teacher, so she makes a lot more money than me, so she went back to work pretty soon after our baby boy was born, while I'm taking a year out to look after him.\n\nThe group stayed in touch and meet up occasionally, and problems started pretty soon at these meetings. \n\nFirstly, Annie loves fashion and clothes. She doesn't overdress but she never wears any casual clothing. She always wears makeup and gets her hair and nails done regularly. Annie showed up briefly at the group once, and once she'd gone I had a couple of them ask me if I'm \"pressuring\" Annie about her appearance after she's given birth and is stressed with work and the baby. I wasn't happy with this. While I respect the effort Annie makes with her appearance, I absolutely do not pressure her to make the amount of effort she does, and she's been dressing this way long before we met. I told her what they said but she didn't mind, and said they were \"just concerned.\" \n\nAlso, a couple of times they've \"inquired\" about how much I do around the house, whether I'm doing enough for the baby, and that they \"hope I'm not making Annie have to do more after work\". None of the women have been asked these questions. \n\nI was doing some shopping yesterday when I bumped into one of the ladies. It's been a while since the last meeting so I asked when we would be meeting up again. She said she'd check the groupchat. I'm not on the chat and didn't know there was one. She told me who the admin was, and I texted her later to ask if I could be added just so I could be kept in the loop. The response I got was \"It's more of a mum's thing\" but she said she would like to add Annie. \n\nI spoke to Annie about this when she got home, and told her that while she can do what she wants, I don't want anything to do with these people. They're judgmental, rude, sexist snobs. Annie said that was a bit harsh and that it was probably just \"differences of opinion gone too far\". I told her they were pr*cks, which upset her because she feels a \"kinship\" to them because they \"shared\" each other's pregnancies. \n\nI'm sorry but these are nasty human beings. I get that we're all tired and stressed with our babies, but I've been treated with utter contempt since I started going to these things without Annie. If Annie wants to keep in touch with them when she has the time that's fine by me, but I'm not going to be involved.", "created_utc": 1684508728, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13ly513/aita_for_telling_my_wife_that_her_friends_are/", "score": 22, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

But if you go back make sure you wind them up by telling them that all your wife does is her hair and make up and does nothing around the house. They sound jealous", "NTA 100% ask you wife how she would feel if the situation were reversed. My husband is a SAHD also. He is an incredible father and fills that role much better than I could. \n\nI have a real problem with the gate keeping moms groups do when it comes to Dads who are in a similar situation as them. \n\nThat being said, you should and an open sage talk with your wife and make sure she doesn\u2019t actually feel that pressure weather from you or elsewhere, also have the conversation about how she feels about your contribution and make sure you are on the same page. The only reason I say that is because if any of my friends were to talk to my husband like that, and say things about him like that, I\u2019d be pretty damn upset at them and I would not brush it off to him. But if I were complaining to them about that kind of thing, then I might say something like \u201coh they\u2019re just concerned.\u201d\n\nAlso the friends might just be projecting their own experiences with their own husbands ms", "NTA. My husband was a SAHD for 5 years, and even his siblings called him my housewife. The difference in how men and women are treated in parenting roles is astounding, and these women have made a lot of negative judgments about you perpetuating a stereotype that, in reality, you're clearly breaking.", "NTA - You voiced your opinion. Clearly, it was a little bit harsh in the wording, but you were frustrated and didn't feel like your wife was completely hearing you and being supportive the way you were hoping. It does sound like the group isn't a good fit for you and that they are being sexist by consistently making assumptions about you and your family dynamic based on antiquated stereotypes, so I understand you not wanting to be around them. \n\nI do understand where your wife is coming from to a certain extent in terms of them going through the pregnancies together and forming a bond over it but honestly, if they're treating you poorly she should be more concerned with that than with keeping up appearances in a group that would so quickly dismiss her husband. You're the one home with the child and most likely need that \"village\" support from people going through the same thing but they seem quick to push you out and that's a real shame on both sides; they're missing out on a different perspective as well as keeping that community from someone who could use it because of their own close-mindedness.\n\nSorry you're going through that and hopefully your wife will come to understand and be more supportive and I hope you can find another group nearby that offers you the support you deserve.", "Wow.  Is \"toxic femininity\" a thing?  Because it seems to be with these gals.  You are NTA.  Try to find some other, supportive new parents to hang with.", "NTA and the only reason your wife thinks they're ok is because she doesn't see them from what you've said. Agree with those who've said they all just sound jealous. I'd stay away from them and seek out other parents maybe in your neighborhood or local area with young kids instead.", "NTA \n\nThey're judgemental and probably jealous of your wife. Ask your wife why she needs to hang out with them first.", "Seems to me they could have said this to your face at the last meeting you attended if that is how they felt instead of being cowardly about it all.  I would be glad not to be around people who believe you control, pressure, persuade, or abuse your wife in some way.  I'm surprised your wife isn't standing by you more than she is, but that is her choice.  I agree with your assessment of them.  NTA", "NTA If you're telling the whole truth then those women were discriminating against you. I hope You're telling the whole truth because I seem to be going against popular opinion here so far in saying NTA.", "So what\u2019s the actual issue here? You don\u2019t like these people and don\u2019t want to be involved with them, and they don\u2019t really want you to attend their gatherings either. Problem solved. You guys aren\u2019t meant to be friends. I don\u2019t really think they\u2019re the pricks you think they are though, but that\u2019s simply a matter of personal opinion.", "Nta. Let's say that you and your wife were in an engineering group. You went inactive, while she remained active. The men in said group don't respect her work; they create a group chat without her; they constantly question her abilities; and even reach out to you so that you can \"double check her work for mistakes\". She complains to you, and you brush her off by saying that you and the group bonded over a mutual project; so you know they weren't malicious.  Would your wife be okay with that? Probably not. \n\nThen your wife takes this problem to reddit. Like the responses you're reading here, the people here are calling her out for complaining, citing that, historically, women aren't as good at math and science as men. Also, there aren't many women engineers, so your wife needs to understand why she's getting disrespected and shunned. \n\nThat's what's going on with you. You are a victim of sexism. Don't let these fem-bots try to convince you otherwise.", "NTA. It looks like an FDS group is slowly adopting your wife.", "So you're feeling what a lot of women have felt for thousands of years - left out and prejudiced against due to your gender. I think you have gone a bit hyperbolic, but they haven't been great either. ESH.", "No judgement. It does not sound like there is a conflict here. \n\nThey pretty obviously want to hang out with you just as much as you want to hang out with them. Your wife is not saying you have to maintain contact. You are not saying that your wife can't maintain contact.\n\nWhere is the conflict?", "ESH. it sounds like a group that is concerned about your woman's well-being. And you should be able to understand where these questions come from. Thousands of women are pressured every day to get back in shape immediately after pregnancy, thousands support husbands and still take care of the house. Your situation is different. OK. you are a rare case. Explain that. Doesn't hurt.", "So...soft ESH. You absolutely have a right to equitable, respectful treatment and mutually supportive relationships. And you don't have to have anything to do with these women and their judgements. You also deserve empathy from your spouse when people are treating you in such a nasty way. Your spouse hasn't shared your experience so is having a hard time wrapping her head around your harsh words. She's coming off as lacking empathy because you're coming off as attacking people whose nice sides are the only sides she's seen. You both would be better off getting out of your heads and into your hearts: talk about the way *you felt* when you were having those interactions with those women. Then clear your life of contact with them and focus on your own family and lives. \n\nSorry you have had to deal with this crappy behavior on top of all the changes to do with having a baby.  Rooting for you. Enjoy the baby, and all the best.", "YTA. I'm not... Really sure what's your issue here. Probably a lot of these women have experienced their partners or seen others not pulling their weight. This tends to be more common with male partners due to ingrained sexism. And it seems to have become a women's group, which kinda sucks but... The level of anger seems disproportionate. What were you even hoping to get out of these social interactions?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Just people that don't want to associate with each other, so they shouldn't.", "While I don't know how to feel about the \"fem-bots\" thing (I've never heard it before so I have no reference) I agree.\n\nYou aren't telling her she can't, you're expressing the way they've treated you (poorly) which is valid and fair. \n\nNTA OP and maybe bring up to your wife Unimpressed's role-reversal example", "FDS?", "So he is the symbolic martyr for what women felt for centuries.\n\nWhat a wonderful way to bring about equality and encourage stay at home dads.

No way.", "okay but just because men have oppressed women in the past, doesn\u2019t mean that op gets treated like crap by the women in the group?", "Why is he TA? All he is doing is taking care of his baby and that entitles the members of the group to treat him rudely? No way. He did and said nothing wrong.", "Hard disagree.

What's op's fault for their husbands not caring about their kids??", "His issue is that HE is the primary caregiver for his child, yet because he's a man these women assume he's not pulling his weight as a parent and a partner. They have no basis for this assumption and are not scrutinizing the other members of the group in the same way. Can you imagine what people would say if the roles were reversed? If Annie was the stay at home parent and a group of men asked her if she was doing enough around the house, and said they hoped she wasn't making more work for her husband when he got home?  In fact, people have said this to women throughout most of history and feminists have been working for decades to end this kind of disgusting attitude. \n\nYes mothers have been devalued, disrespected, shamed, belittled etc. since the dawn of time. That absolutely needs to change.  However, the way to do that is NOT by treating fathers who are clearly supportive of subverting traditional gender roles, and being proper parents and partners, with the same disrespect as women have endured for centuries.  I'm not saying OP needs any kind of special acknowledgent or praise for simply doing his job as a parent.  I am saying he does not deserve condescension simply because he's a man.", "Hopefully for OP\u2019s sake there are other parent groups in the area where he might like the people/feel included more. Hell, I\u2019d even say look for a SAHD group in particular.
