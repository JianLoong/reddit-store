Nobody really likes hanging out with their family when they're in their late teens, it's totally normal. It's also normal to want to spend your birthday with friends or doing something you enjoy doing.\n\nHowever, you will probably enjoy seeing them when you're older. And they'll probably be nicer to you once your teenage years are past. People are judgemental of teens in a way that they aren't with young adults, and the fact that your family does want to spend regular time together is a good thing. \n\nWith that in mind, I can understand why your mum is upset that you would rather do what she perceives as \"nothing\" than hang out with the family. Your parents love you and probably want to celebrate your birthday. Could you maybe say you get overwhelmed by all the relatives and that you'd like to go out for a nice dinner with your parents/ have a takeaway of your choice and cake at home in the evening? You can still spend the daytime doing your art, but I'm sure Mum would appreciate you including your immediate family in your birthday.", "Oh, that will at least explain the rudeness, and your bluntness.  It's a bit more forgiving.

I struggle in working out what to do on my birthday for family involvement. I've settled on a plan that usually works out well - a nice walk somewhere (you're moving with external things to talk about, it's pleasant and it is a set time) followed by coffee/drink and walk back. Then a takeaway/special dinner. This is enough to tire people not to want a late night, and an early cake dessert is the end of things. I can feel grateful for having people to celebrate and care for me, but not feeling like I am endlessly entertaining or being 'on' and waiting around. I often prefer alone time with entertainment but appreciate their are people in my world who want to meaningfully connect even though it might not always be super fulfilling for me at the time.", "NTA while you may have to love your family you certainly dont have to like them", "Oof. I'm going against the grain here, light YTA. Not for what you said, but for *how* you said it.\n\nI get that you're a teen, and teens generally don't like spending time with their parents, but, you could soften the blow. \"A party isn't something I'm interested in right now, I'd just like some time alone to decompress.\" Comes off a lot differently than \"I don't like spending time with you.\"", "YTA", "Nta", "NTA.
