I've met her a handful of times and until this incident didn't think one way or another about her. There've been a couple of weird things prior and after asking my friend, no Molly isn't on the spectrum or have food aversions. Which leads to why I'm posting here:\n\nA friend invited us out, and she asked if Molly could come along. While we were ordering Molly kept making a big deal with the waitress about how she didn't want 'raw' shrimp with her meal, she wanted it cooked. Molly pointed to the table next to us where one of the people had grilled shrimp and said \"That's what I mean, I don't want raw shrimp. I want it cooked.\" The waitress was a champ and told her she'd ask if they could substitute tempura shrimp for the regular grilled shrimp. While the waitress was gone, my friend told Molly that the shrimp is cooked and not raw, it's just grilled. Molly went on a whole tangent about how it didn't look cooked to her, insisted that it was raw. Whatever, we order and try to drop it. A couple of us got regular shrimp with our meals, myself included and I got a side of tempura shrimp cause that stuff is good.\n\nSo here's where I might be the AH: When we got our food and started eating Molly made another comment about how she didn't get how we could eat 'raw' food like that and we were going to get sick. I had enough and told her that our food is cooked, and the only difference between our shrimp and hers was the breading, so I peeled off the tempura from one of my pieces, and held it and a regular grilled shrimp up to her and went \"See? They look the same, the shit is already cooked you're just being willfully ignorant.\" Molly excused herself to the bathroom and the vibe was killed after that. We got our food to go and paid right after that, and I did apologize to the rest of my friends. My friend, and another of our friends have been on my case the past day and a half over this and keep telling me I need to apologize to Molly. I don't think apologizing to her is warranted in this instance though- its one thing to have a hang up over a food item, but it's another to keep making comments after you've already had something explained to you.

Does she need every kind of meat covered by a breading so to hide the meat appearance underneath?

The name unfriedshrimp is funny btw.\n\nShe's 30ish and old enough to take the criticism she dished out. My guess is, it was your tone, not the words, because clarifying information with a demonstration doesn't warrant a person going to the bathroom, and two people thinking you need to apologize.\n\nI also can understand why you'd be upset. It's one thing to be wrong, but to be confidently wrong and using your words, having a \"tangent\" based on wrong information...well, that's irritating. If it was your tone, then you can apologize for your tone, without apologizing for the information.  I'm sorry I raised my voice, yelled, screamed, belittled you, etc; doesn't mean the information itself was wrong. It just means you recognize you could've said it in a calmer or in a different fashion. \n\nOnly you and the people there know your behavior.

Now if you make any attempt to educate people you get accused of hurting their feelings and need to apologise. Ignorance and hurt feelings trumps education and truth. It is a very worrying trend to allow people to go around sprouting nonsense and misinformation.

She was being very annoying and inappropriate about it, but you probably shouldn\u2019t have called her \u201cwillfully ignorant.\u201d Simply peeling off some of the tempura and saying \u201csee, they\u2019re the same inside\u201d with a smile would\u2019ve done it. I mean she was being willfully ignorant, but some things speak for themselves.", "NTA I\u2019ve known people like Molly who have some weird hangup that\u2019s factually wrong, which is fine, but they won\u2019t shut up about it to an annoying extent. She was criticizing your food at a dinner - you did a fine thing to shut up someone being irritating", "YTA\n\nYou know Molly is wrong, the waitress knows Molly is wrong.  You really didn\u2019t have to prove a point to her.  Treat stuff like this, like telling kids there is no Santa Claus.  Does it hurt you that she is like that?  No.  So leave it alone.", "ESH. She was being rude. I guess some people think that makes it ok for you to be rude. But she was upset enough by your tone that she felt she had to leave the table, probably to cry in the bathroom, and the people who were actually there think you were in the wrong.\n\nThere were other ways to handle it, including just directly asking her to stop criticisng other people's food. But you snapped at her, and made assumptions about her intentions. I can't imagine why anyone would be \"willfully ignorant\" about shrimp.", "YTA The waitress knew what she was talking about so I assume this is a common mistake. She handled it well and let it be a non issue. You, who have nothing at stake in this meal order, wrecked a dinner over small talk. \n\nObviously Molly doesn\u2019t cook seafood, and to be offended on behalf of seafood is odd.
