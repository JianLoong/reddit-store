I've met her a handful of times and until this incident didn't think one way or another about her. There've been a couple of weird things prior and after asking my friend, no Molly isn't on the spectrum or have food aversions. Which leads to why I'm posting here:\n\nA friend invited us out, and she asked if Molly could come along. While we were ordering Molly kept making a big deal with the waitress about how she didn't want 'raw' shrimp with her meal, she wanted it cooked. Molly pointed to the table next to us where one of the people had grilled shrimp and said \"That's what I mean, I don't want raw shrimp. I want it cooked.\" The waitress was a champ and told her she'd ask if they could substitute tempura shrimp for the regular grilled shrimp. While the waitress was gone, my friend told Molly that the shrimp is cooked and not raw, it's just grilled. Molly went on a whole tangent about how it didn't look cooked to her, insisted that it was raw. Whatever, we order and try to drop it. A couple of us got regular shrimp with our meals, myself included and I got a side of tempura shrimp cause that stuff is good.\n\nSo here's where I might be the AH: When we got our food and started eating Molly made another comment about how she didn't get how we could eat 'raw' food like that and we were going to get sick. I had enough and told her that our food is cooked, and the only difference between our shrimp and hers was the breading, so I peeled off the tempura from one of my pieces, and held it and a regular grilled shrimp up to her and went \"See? They look the same, the shit is already cooked you're just being willfully ignorant.\" Molly excused herself to the bathroom and the vibe was killed after that. We got our food to go and paid right after that, and I did apologize to the rest of my friends. My friend, and another of our friends have been on my case the past day and a half over this and keep telling me I need to apologize to Molly. I don't think apologizing to her is warranted in this instance though- its one thing to have a hang up over a food item, but it's another to keep making comments after you've already had something explained to you.

She then proceeded to insult the food of the others at the table.\n\nI honestly think I would have done the same thing, but it just wouldn\u2019t be worth it. If someone is not using logic, then no amount of logic will ever change their mind. Op could\u2019ve dragged Molly to the kitchen and hold her head to grill to watch the shrimp cook in real time and it would\u2019ve somehow prove her point (in her twisted mind at least).\n\nBut unless she\u2019s going to go on a smear campaign against or call the health inspector on the restaurant, then there is nothing to lose letting her spin her wheels and even less to gain. Op is wasting their energy on a fool\u2019s errand that doesn\u2019t even have a promise of a reward at the end.\n\nYou can lead a horse to water but you can\u2019t convince it the grilled shrimp is cooked.", "This was me as a child. I was terrified to eat Buffalo wings because kid me thought it was buffalo meat.", "Probably because every other person would just be referring to it as \u201cred meat\u201d because nobody colloquially refers to pork/beef/veal/whatever as \u201cmammal meat\u201d.

I am someone easily put off food if certain things are said, but I\u2019m also socially anxious and conflict avoidant, and likely wouldn\u2019t dare to chime in even if Molly\u2019s comments were upsetting me because I don\u2019t want to disturb the peace. OP shutting her down with the fact that the food is fine, not gross, it\u2019s cooked, there\u2019s literally no difference\u2014that\u2019s something I could see being the one thing that could fix my appetite in that moment.\n\nThis is the problem you run into when you try to use empathy to extrapolate what MIGHT be the case. You relate to one person present and toss aside everyone else who you also know nothing about. At that point, of course you could add all kinds of context to make anyone at that table the AH. But persistently making comments about how gross other people\u2019s food is is a mean thing to do, and it\u2019s just not appropriate to expect *OP to be a doormat when the kid gloves were already tried and failed.", "I agree and very well said!

I mean it\u2019s just logic to me. \n\nOr.

I bit my tongue a thousand times for every time I did speak up and there comes a point where\u2014and you hit the nail on the head with it\u2014willful ignorance can\u2019t just be overlooked.

What makes it even worse is that she reacts like a 5-year-old when told the truth.  \n\nPeople like this are annoying as hell and people encouraging this behavior (like Molly's friends) even more.  If she is able to dish out, she needs to be able to take it.", "Reminds me of my grandmother.
