Children cry, it happens. He shouldn\u2019t have made that comment and you went completely nuclear in him. \n\nMy advice to you is to get your child familiar with dogs. He will go to friends\u2019 homes with dogs. People now bring their dogs everywhere. He needs to know how to feel comfortable around them.", "ESH.\n\n\nIs it well known that this establishment has dogs with owners eating outside? Sort of sounds like it as two people with dogs rocked up. \n\nAnyway, he sucks because he thinks a baby crying is something that can be controlled quickly and suggesting you leave because of it. Also for taking his not very social dog into a place where other dogs could be. \n\nYou suck for escalating the situation and yelling infront of your already upset baby. That wasn't exactly going to help your situation was it?\n\nI have a kid. If she got fussy like that in public I took jer away from others until she calmed down. Parents do indeed get to eat out with their babies, but you also have to be mindful of others when you do so. The sound of a baby crying is designed to be annoying so you don't ignore it.", ">I flip out, tell him to shut the fuck up and blame his dog for why my kid is crying\n\ni was leaning towards E S H but for this alone, YTA for going absolutely nuclear rather than having a calm conversation. \n\n  \nits not just about the guy. its about everyone else at the restaurant and theres a difference between a dog growling for a couple seconds and a baby crying for more than a few min \n\nmaybe take anger management classes", "ESH. His dog disrupted people\u2019s meals.\n\nYour child disrupted people\u2019s (besides this guy\u2019s) meals. It is not reasonable to expect people to put up with 30 seconds or \u201ca few minutes\u201d of your baby\u2019s crying. It\u2019s obviously not your fault the baby is crying, babies just do that but that\u2019s why people hire babysitters or walk their kids outside away from other diners when they start getting fussy.\n\nAlso choosing to engage and escalate with some stranger with temper problems while your 10 month old around isn\u2019t great.", "ESH\n\nIf it's a pet friendly patio, one bark/growl and then calm is not out of the expected for a dog especially if they're working on socializing and the dog was corrected immediately which sounds like what happened. A crying baby is also a fact of life. \n\nThe problem is that both of you made unreasonable demands of the other, you went to a pet friendly patio and was annoyed that there were pets being pets; he went out in public where babies exist and was annoyed by baby and made an out of line suggestion for you to move.  \n\nYou both escalated needlessly, yes he was rude but you also could have reacted much better to wind it down instead of make things worse. Classic you can only control your reaction not what other people do.", "Esh did you yelling help calm down your kid?  Or did it upset him more? \n\nHis dog disturbed people's lunches and so did your kid.\n\nYou also say your kid has minimal exposure to dogs for his safety but think it's tooootally safe to flip on a stranger?  What if the dude was a nut job and decked  you one?????", ">Its maybe 30 seconds and the other guy tells us maybe we should take him away. I see no reason to do that and I tell him he'll be fine in a few minutes. My kid however isn't calming down as quick as we hoped. The guy pipes up again and says my crying kid is ruining his meal. I flip out, tell him to shut the fuck up and blame his dog for why my kid is crying.\n\nWell that escalated quickly. ESH. \n\nYou for flipping out and cussing him out. Did the aggravation soothe the baby? Baby cries are annoying and if it wasn't people wouldn't try so hard to quiet them. If mom noticed he wasn't quieting down, it makes sense to move away, maybe the baby is scared and needed to be in a safe space. \n\n>Another guy with a dog shows up. The dog barks/growls at him. The guy gets his dog to be quiet. The other dog doesn't react at all.\n\nSo, he was able to quiet his dog immediately. That makes him less of an AH. Clearly dogs are allowed and they're outside having them further away from people. You're entitled to be there too, but recognize it's more reasonable to have their dog outside. \n\nHe's an AH for losing his cool and saying the baby is ruining his meal. At the same time, baby cries can drive people crazy and his dog bark that was quickly quieted, causing your baby to cry, isn't a reason to not take baby somewhere he feels safe. \n\nMost people will walk away from a crowd with their crying baby out of respect for others. If you say he wasn't calming down, then he should've been taken away from everyone instead of engaging with a man who may be a lunatic. I'm putting more blame on you, because I live in a state where people love guns and escalating a situation with your baby is not mature or safe. Your child's safety comes first, sometimes you have to swallow your pride and avoid people who may be deranged and try to harm you.", "NTA. To be clear, I dont have any kids. I do have three dogs. I also dislike it when people bring small children to restaurants and let them scream or misbehave or whatever. \n\nAnd I think the other guy was in the wrong here. For one, if it comes down to it, people > dogs at restaurants. Except maybe actual service dogs, of course. \n\nTwo, him telling you to take your kid away when they hadn\u2019t been crying for very long (even if it was more than the 30 seconds as you say, it doesn\u2019t sound like your kid was in distress for a while and y\u2019all just sat there) was uncalled for. Especially since it was his dog that growled/barked at the other dog and started the chain of events (I guess dog barking ok, baby crying not ok?) \n\nDude sounds like a prick. NTA.", "NTA, My dogs are my kids, and if mine made a noise to make a child cry, I would have been so apologetic. I definitely would not have acted as this guy did. (But I also have never taken my dogs anywhere like a restaurant).", "NTA - Most people should expect to encounter a child at a restaurant. Especially if it's day time hours. Kids and babies cry sometimes (shocking I know). Now, dogs are also welcome at patio's, but the guy who's dog is reactive to other dogs probably should know that and not take him in public. Telling parents who are actively trying to soothe their child, that the crying is being an asshole. Like if it was sustained crying for minutes, or the parents weren't even trying to calm the kid, but that doesn't sound like the case. - Now you did escalate the encounter, but eh, he was an asshole and it shouldn't have caused you to leave.", "INFO: Was this a dog friendly establishment? \n\nESH. If this is in a public setting and a dog friendly establishment.\n\nI think it's rude and lacking empathy for someone saying the crying is ruining his meal. If it's that annoying, then I think the person could leave. Not make rude comments. It's a 10 month old for pete's sake.\n\nBut flipping out and escalating the situation by saying \"shut the fuck up\" ? Yikes.\n\nBasically ya'll handled it poorly.", "I don\u2019t think OP is TA. It\u2019s okay for babies to cry when they get scared. That guy with the dog was being an A-hole about it though.", "ESH.  There was no need for all that. Instead of being bigger people you both escalated the one-upmannship bullshit.  The hostess should have bounced you both, because I almost guarantee the other diners around you were annoyed with your nonsense,  and were simply mature enough not to comment on it", "ESH - it was neither the fault of the dog nor the child. All y\u2019all grown ass adults were literally blaming literal non-verbal beings for y\u2019all\u2019s inability to eat food in a semi-shared space.", "NTA not only did the dog scare your kid, I\u2019m sure he could feel the dog owner\u2019s anger as well. Kids can sense that stuff immediately. I absolutely would have stuck up for my kid in this situation. Eff that hothead. With that being said, I did used to carry my kids away from others eating if it went on too long. It was rare I had to, but if I couldn\u2019t calm them quickly, I\u2019d pick them up and walk outside or if on the patio, up the block.", "NTA\nWhat entitled A H demands a baby leave in a public space. You're fine OP", "Yes, YTA because you apparently decided to get into a shouting match with someone at a restaurant. Not due to the underlying situation. If he had a yappy growling dog, you can have a whiny crying baby. So having a kid that cries does not make you an asshole, just a very ordinary parent. You should have just ignored him not escalated into a shouting match.", "YTA it's very simple. He got his dog to calm down, so the dog can stay. You couldn't get your kid to calm. You're the asshole.", "NTA.    \n\n\n1. Why would the dog have to go to the restaurant in the first place?  You complain when the dog gets to a growl. Are you going wait until the dog jumps on the baby (or the wife) before you object?\n2. He was there, you showed up, his dog barked, your child cried.  Somehow that's your fault? \n3. | *He tells me if I can't handle my kid I shouldn't be going out to eat.*   \nWell, if you can't keep your dog from growling, maybe you shouldn't be taking your dog out to eat.", "YTA\n\nYou said it yourself. He got the dog to stop. You didn't get your kid to stop. Kid starts crying and not stopping. You take them away to calm down. \n\nYour kid could have been startled by a waitress dropping something. The dog stopped. Good for him on training him.", "ESH - I have a reactive dog and although I would love to be able to bring her to busy places like patios, I know she would act like an asshole, so I don\u2019t. He also shouldn\u2019t have given you so much trouble for a crying baby. That\u2019s ridiculous. \n\nIt would also be a good idea to help familiarize your little boy with dogs. You don\u2019t have to be super friendly with them, but if he grows up with no exposure to them he might not learn how to act safely around them if he ever finds himself in that situation. I\u2019ve seen some not very dog-savvy kids get knocked down because they didn\u2019t know how to act around them.\n\nIt also feels like you two are very polarized on the kids vs dogs spectrum. Interesting to see it play out.", "NTA - The baby got scared, it happens. A lot of people think that whenever a baby cries it needs to be removed immediately, which is not always possible and, in my opinion, a really strange expectation to have. Babies are allowed in public spaces, and they\u2019re going to cry from time to time. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to ruin anyone\u2019s meal to hear a few minutes of crying. The dog owener was unnecessarily rude.", "YTA, my man. I sympathize with you, your wife, and your kid (dogs barking and snarling at each other can be anxiety inducing at any age) , and I'm sure dealing with a small child is hard, however, you were not at a private place in a private environment, like your home. You were in a public place where a bunch of people completely separate from your family also wanted to go out and enjoy a meal in the nice weather. You had the ability to step away with your kid and let others around you go back to enjoying their experience. Not doing it is definitely AH behavior. You also escalated the situation with the guy who had a right to voice his feelings as you were probably ruining his meal and you insulted his dog. Definitely AH behavior as well. All of that unpleasentness could have been avoided by just stepping away for a second with your kid.", "NTA people with dogs who take them everywhere can be so impossible. The dog made your kid cry. Your kid wasn\u2019t crying for no reason. You could have reacted better but sounds like you were in a tough position. Situations are always way harder when your kid is crying.", "NTA. Where children should be and what to do when they cry can be a dicey sometimes, but here the dog\u2019s barking caused your baby to cry, so the dog owner has no justification here. Even without dog, he shouldn\u2019t do more than complain to restaurant. Unless they don\u2019t allow babies, it\u2019s the man\u2019s prerogative to stay or leave. If the restaurant thinks you\u2019re being too loud, they could ask you to leave. The low blows at your parenting are ridiculous.", "Dogs do not belong at restaurants period. If I want to eat with a dog I'd go to a kennel not a restaurant. Kids and babies are humans who eat food thus belong at restaurants. Nta. \n\nI'm getting very tired already of the warmer weather and entitled dog people bringing their barely trained dogs everywhere. Iv almost gotten bit 2x in 1 week both times by inattentive owners letting their dogs roam on long leashes not paying a care to them. The 2nd dog tried to take a bite out of my baby who's fingers were dangling from the pram AFTER I yelled at the lady to watch her dog who nipped at my leg as she walked past. That was a 2 for 1 special just today. \n\nIf your dog hasn't had exstensive training keep them on a short leash or keep them at home.", "ESH - He was an AH and so were you. I would have been on your side if you didn't blow up and call his dog shitty. Such an overreaction on both ends.", "Ugh, a crying kid at a restaurant and a parent not caring. YTA", "YTA, I\u2019m not a kid family. Stop ruining everyone\u2019s dinner.", "YTA and nobody wants to hear your darling angel cry for several minutes. Apparently the dog owner quieted his dog immediately. Which means he handled the situation.\n\nYou did not.\n\nOh and before you drink up all the NTA\u2019s you are receiving, these will melt away once your little prince turns 3 and is so accustomed to behaving badly that he runs around in a restaurant while you think \u201cit\u2019s cute\u201d.  \n\nYou are getting a pass because he\u2019s 10 months. Maybe you feel entitled because you believe nothing and nobody should tell you or your kid to stop doing something. It\u2019s too early to tell. You should have removed the crying kid from the other patrons. You could have taken him for a short walk for the crying duration.\n\nAway from the dog wouldn\u2019t have hurt.

I dealt with the same issue when my youngest was smaller, she\u2019s 3 now and just starting to accept dogs. She loves to see them run around, when they\u2019re jumping and licking at her or barking loud it\u2019s another story.

However, that comes with several sizeable responsibilities, including consideration for people out in public. People have allergies, phobias surrounding dogs (including trauma due to bad experiences with dogs), phobias about germs, general anxieties about having their personal space invaded (dogs being social creatures can often infringe on the personal space of people, simply looking for rubs and attention, even on leashes and especially certain super-friendly breeds, and so much more). \n\n\nPet owners have become increasingly entitled and inconsiderate about their own desire to have their animals with them everywhere, and it comes at a cost to others who shouldn't be required to accommodate them, sometimes a high cost.\n\n\nService animals are one matter, and the dog owner has very stringent requirements that must be met for these helper dogs. Therapy dogs have value and should be rightly allowed in certain circumstances, are also a consideration. Regardless, that's not the case the majority of the time. People find it perfectly acceptable to just cart their (non-service/non-therapy) dogs anywhere and everywhere these days, and that's becoming a huge problem for many people in the public at large. Pets do not belong in restaurants at large. Nor do they belong at grocery stores, salons, and other such places.\n\n\nNobody \"needs to get used to dogs\" to the extent that is being advocated in that comment, and those who choose to not associate with dogs regularly - for any reason whether medical or personal - should neither be villianized or forced to have such repeated interactions in public places. \n\n\nWhen having a dog in a public space (park, sidewalk, and the like) the ability for physical distancing exists to avoid or limit close (physical, visual and auditory) contact, and the length of time for that contact is significantly temporary and minimalized. To have them at an establishment such as a restaurant or shopping center can literally ruin the experience and hinder the normal and rightful movement of others, and that's both unnecessary and unfair to the public at large. \n\n\nThe mindset that others need to accommodate a dog owners convenience to have their pet at the hip most of the time in public places is extremely unreasonable and highly inappropriate. It is becoming a huge problem for too many, too often, and it's become widespread. The self-entitlement is actually sickening.\n\n\nI expect I'll get majorly flamed and down voted for this, but my view on this from comes from a place of being a huge animal lover who takes their responsibility as a pet owner as seriously as the need to display common courtesy and consideration to others in public places.\n\n\nThe OP is NTA, the patron he had to deal with reeks of self-entitlement, and the comment that outright implies that OP and his child need to get used to this sort of thing and be more accommodating to dogs and their owners is ridiculous and downright inappropriate. \n\n\nThis is the type of scenario that displays why good people cannot have nice things.", "Or just maybe people leave their dogs at home.", "Kids don\u2019t NEED to be familiar with dogs.", "No. Dogs aren\u2019t for everyone \u2026 and they shouldn\u2019t be allowed in places of hygiene.

And when I said misbehave, I meant like let their kid run around and expect the staff to supervise them (have experienced that myself when I was a bartender) because that\u2019s rude and also unsafe. As far as crying goes- babies and sometimes kids, cry. That\u2019s life. Now if the child cannot be soothed after a reasonable amount of time (what constitutes reasonable varies depending on the situation) then yes, the parent should remove the kid from the situation and try to calm them down so as to minimize the disruption to the other people around (also this seems to help kids calm down).", "Honestly my issue is that (according to OP) this dude was real quick to be like \u201cyou should take that kid out of here\u201d, followed soon thereafter by complaining about his meal being ruined. Like my dude, it\u2019s an outdoor eating area that apparently allows both dogs and small children. So it\u2019s not a fine dining establishment. And one should not expect a quiet dining environment either. Dude\u2019s dog can bark and growl to communicate it\u2019s feelings but the baby crying in response to barking and growling is unacceptable? Nah. If you expect people to be cool with your dog- of whom they may be fearful or to whom they may be allergic, and who may or may not be properly trained and might proceed to bark and growl at any other dog that shows up- in a dining space, then you have to give parents some grace when if their kid is scared by your dog barking and growling. \n\nI stand by my assessment.

The dog owner was absolutely prioritizing his dog over the baby (which, normally, fair - it\u2019s his dog, and the baby is a stranger - but the \u201cproblem\u201d here was due to the combination of dog and baby) instead of thinking of removing the dog from the situation, he thought the best thing was for the baby to leave.", "I feel like people are deeply misunderstanding what OP wrote tho.

Kid throws a tantrum that won't stop during the middle of dinner? There was a phase where my husband and I would take turns taking the kid to the car while the other parent finished their meal, paid, and got the rest of the other parent's meal boxed up for later.

Settles baby on her lap with bottle and tries to deal with a toddler that's awake about 4 hours before she wants to be. You and me both kid.\n\nOh well it's 4 hours I'll live, they may not but I will. Finally we're wheels up, and toddler is really starting to feel the ear pressure. I dig out gum and hand it to Mom. Baby is done with the bottle and starting her pre scream process, while Mom is teaching her toddler how to chew gum...\n\nI close my eyes and go somewhere more pleasant like the dentist.\n\nThen I feel a huge tug at my beard. Apparently I'd dropped to sleep because before either adult was fully aware the baby had used my beard to pull herself into my lap, snuggled into my nest and promptly went to sleep.\n\nMom does the omg I'm so sorry thing and tries to retrieve baby. I covered baby with the edge of my jacket and with my best smile and stage whisper \"hell no, she's asleep, let's do everything to keep it that way\".\n\nOpen mouth stare... I say sorry, I know it's your baby I was just being funny and dreaming about going back to sleep. Toddler fusses, Mom turns takes 3 seconds to deal with that looks back at me and baby both with eyes closed and says are you really sure? 1 eye open I said absolutely. I don't really expect you to leave her in my lap, but I'm 100% ok with her sleeping in my jacket.\nI have 1 of my own about the same age as your other one.\n\nFor the rest of the 4hr flight baby and I slept like the dead, Mom got some peace and quiet time with her toddler.\n\nMe? I got the best damn sleep on a plane before or since.", "For sure! I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything wrong with either dogs or kids on patios. That\u2019s not the issue here", "Absolutely agree", "No. You\u2019re wrong. Humans before PETS at restaurant. Period.", "I wish I could never be subjected to a dog but here we are.", "Dogs should be left home because they are dangerous and gross.", "You are exactly right. If you punish the dog for growling, the warning cues go away because the dog has learned that they aren't alright, and next thing you know the dog bites a kid \"out of nowhere\" even though it wasn't out of nowhere at all, it was just the dog learned to not give warnings and go straight to the next step when they don't feel comfortable.", "Oh, you're right! He is a \ud83e\udd80 . . .even creepier than lobsters, but I'd still be his friend.", "I mean I firmly feel the crying child has as much right to be on the patio as a dog, much less a barking dog. That\u2019s where you bring children when they are having a fit- outside. \n\nWould that guy be miserable if a couple walk-in down the street outside had their crying child? No it\u2019s a patio."]}
