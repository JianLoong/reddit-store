He will go to friends\u2019 homes with dogs. People now bring their dogs everywhere. He needs to know how to feel comfortable around them.", "ESH.\n\n\nIs it well known that this establishment has dogs with owners eating outside? Sort of sounds like it as two people with dogs rocked up. \n\nAnyway, he sucks because he thinks a baby crying is something that can be controlled quickly and suggesting you leave because of it. Also for taking his not very social dog into a place where other dogs could be. \n\nYou suck for escalating the situation and yelling infront of your already upset baby. That wasn't exactly going to help your situation was it?\n\nI have a kid. If she got fussy like that in public I took jer away from others until she calmed down. Parents do indeed get to eat out with their babies, but you also have to be mindful of others when you do so. The sound of a baby crying is designed to be annoying so you don't ignore it.", ">I flip out, tell him to shut the fuck up and blame his dog for why my kid is crying\n\ni was leaning towards E S H but for this alone, YTA for going absolutely nuclear rather than having a calm conversation. \n\n  \nits not just about the guy. its about everyone else at the restaurant and theres a difference between a dog growling for a couple seconds and a baby crying for more than a few min \n\nmaybe take anger management classes", "ESH. His dog disrupted people\u2019s meals.\n\nYour child disrupted people\u2019s (besides this guy\u2019s) meals. It is not reasonable to expect people to put up with 30 seconds or \u201ca few minutes\u201d of your baby\u2019s crying. It\u2019s obviously not your fault the baby is crying, babies just do that but that\u2019s why people hire babysitters or walk their kids outside away from other diners when they start getting fussy.\n\nAlso choosing to engage and escalate with some stranger with temper problems while your 10 month old around isn\u2019t great.", "ESH\n\nIf it's a pet friendly patio, one bark/growl and then calm is not out of the expected for a dog especially if they're working on socializing and the dog was corrected immediately which sounds like what happened. A crying baby is also a fact of life. \n\nThe problem is that both of you made unreasonable demands of the other, you went to a pet friendly patio and was annoyed that there were pets being pets; he went out in public where babies exist and was annoyed by baby and made an out of line suggestion for you to move.  \n\nYou both escalated needlessly, yes he was rude but you also could have reacted much better to wind it down instead of make things worse. Classic you can only control your reaction not what other people do.", "Esh did you yelling help calm down your kid?  Or did it upset him more? \n\nHis dog disturbed people's lunches and so did your kid.\n\nYou also say your kid has minimal exposure to dogs for his safety but think it's tooootally safe to flip on a stranger?  What if the dude was a nut job and decked  you one?????", ">Its maybe 30 seconds and the other guy tells us maybe we should take him away. I see no reason to do that and I tell him he'll be fine in a few minutes. My kid however isn't calming down as quick as we hoped. The guy pipes up again and says my crying kid is ruining his meal. I flip out, tell him to shut the fuck up and blame his dog for why my kid is crying.\n\nWell that escalated quickly. ESH. \n\nYou for flipping out and cussing him out. Did the aggravation soothe the baby? Baby cries are annoying and if it wasn't people wouldn't try so hard to quiet them. If mom noticed he wasn't quieting down, it makes sense to move away, maybe the baby is scared and needed to be in a safe space. \n\n>Another guy with a dog shows up. The dog barks/growls at him. The guy gets his dog to be quiet. The other dog doesn't react at all.\n\nSo, he was able to quiet his dog immediately. That makes him less of an AH. Clearly dogs are allowed and they're outside having them further away from people. You're entitled to be there too, but recognize it's more reasonable to have their dog outside. \n\nHe's an AH for losing his cool and saying the baby is ruining his meal. At the same time, baby cries can drive people crazy and his dog bark that was quickly quieted, causing your baby to cry, isn't a reason to not take baby somewhere he feels safe. \n\nMost people will walk away from a crowd with their crying baby out of respect for others. If you say he wasn't calming down, then he should've been taken away from everyone instead of engaging with a man who may be a lunatic. I'm putting more blame on you, because I live in a state where people love guns and escalating a situation with your baby is not mature or safe. Your child's safety comes first, sometimes you have to swallow your pride and avoid people who may be deranged and try to harm you.", "NTA. To be clear, I dont have any kids. I do have three dogs. I also dislike it when people bring small children to restaurants and let them scream or misbehave or whatever. \n\nAnd I think the other guy was in the wrong here. For one, if it comes down to it, people > dogs at restaurants. Except maybe actual service dogs, of course. \n\nTwo, him telling you to take your kid away when they hadn\u2019t been crying for very long (even if it was more than the 30 seconds as you say, it doesn\u2019t sound like your kid was in distress for a while and y\u2019all just sat there) was uncalled for. Especially since it was his dog that growled/barked at the other dog and started the chain of events (I guess dog barking ok, baby crying not ok?) \n\nDude sounds like a prick. NTA.", "NTA, My dogs are my kids, and if mine made a noise to make a child cry, I would have been so apologetic. I definitely would not have acted as this guy did. (But I also have never taken my dogs anywhere like a restaurant).", "NTA - Most people should expect to encounter a child at a restaurant. Especially if it's day time hours. Kids and babies cry sometimes (shocking I know). Now, dogs are also welcome at patio's, but the guy who's dog is reactive to other dogs probably should know that and not take him in public. Telling parents who are actively trying to soothe their child, that the crying is being an asshole. Like if it was sustained crying for minutes, or the parents weren't even trying to calm the kid, but that doesn't sound like the case. - Now you did escalate the encounter, but eh, he was an asshole and it shouldn't have caused you to leave.", "INFO: Was this a dog friendly establishment? \n\nESH. If this is in a public setting and a dog friendly establishment.\n\nI think it's rude and lacking empathy for someone saying the crying is ruining his meal. If it's that annoying, then I think the person could leave. Not make rude comments. It's a 10 month old for pete's sake.\n\nBut flipping out and escalating the situation by saying \"shut the fuck up\" ? Yikes.\n\nBasically ya'll handled it poorly.", "I don\u2019t think OP is TA. It\u2019s okay for babies to cry when they get scared. That guy with the dog was being an A-hole about it though.", "ESH.  There was no need for all that. Instead of being bigger people you both escalated the one-upmannship bullshit.  The hostess should have bounced you both, because I almost guarantee the other diners around you were annoyed with your nonsense,  and were simply mature enough not to comment on it", "ESH - it was neither the fault of the dog nor the child. All y\u2019all grown ass adults were literally blaming literal non-verbal beings for y\u2019all\u2019s inability to eat food in a semi-shared space.", "NTA not only did the dog scare your kid, I\u2019m sure he could feel the dog owner\u2019s anger as well. Kids can sense that stuff immediately. I absolutely would have stuck up for my kid in this situation. Eff that hothead. With that being said, I did used to carry my kids away from others eating if it went on too long. It was rare I had to, but if I couldn\u2019t calm them quickly, I\u2019d pick them up and walk outside or if on the patio, up the block.", "NTA\nWhat entitled A H demands a baby leave in a public space. You're fine OP", "Yes, YTA because you apparently decided to get into a shouting match with someone at a restaurant. Not due to the underlying situation. If he had a yappy growling dog, you can have a whiny crying baby. So having a kid that cries does not make you an asshole, just a very ordinary parent. You should have just ignored him not escalated into a shouting match.", "YTA it's very simple. He got his dog to calm down, so the dog can stay. You couldn't get your kid to calm. You're the asshole.", "NTA.    \n\n\n1. Why would the dog have to go to the restaurant in the first place?  You complain when the dog gets to a growl. Are you going wait until the dog jumps on the baby (or the wife) before you object?\n2. He was there, you showed up, his dog barked, your child cried.  Somehow that's your fault? \n3. | *He tells me if I can't handle my kid I shouldn't be going out to eat.*   \nWell, if you can't keep your dog from growling, maybe you shouldn't be taking your dog out to eat.", "YTA\n\nYou said it yourself. He got the dog to stop. You didn't get your kid to stop. Kid starts crying and not stopping. You take them away to calm down. \n\nYour kid could have been startled by a waitress dropping something. The dog stopped. Good for him on training him.", "ESH - I have a reactive dog and although I would love to be able to bring her to busy places like patios, I know she would act like an asshole, so I don\u2019t. He also shouldn\u2019t have given you so much trouble for a crying baby. That\u2019s ridiculous. \n\nIt would also be a good idea to help familiarize your little boy with dogs. You don\u2019t have to be super friendly with them, but if he grows up with no exposure to them he might not learn how to act safely around them if he ever finds himself in that situation. I\u2019ve seen some not very dog-savvy kids get knocked down because they didn\u2019t know how to act around them.\n\nIt also feels like you two are very polarized on the kids vs dogs spectrum. Interesting to see it play out.", "NTA - The baby got scared, it happens. A lot of people think that whenever a baby cries it needs to be removed immediately, which is not always possible and, in my opinion, a really strange expectation to have. Babies are allowed in public spaces, and they\u2019re going to cry from time to time. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to ruin anyone\u2019s meal to hear a few minutes of crying. The dog owener was unnecessarily rude.", "YTA, my man. I sympathize with you, your wife, and your kid (dogs barking and snarling at each other can be anxiety inducing at any age) , and I'm sure dealing with a small child is hard, however, you were not at a private place in a private environment, like your home. You were in a public place where a bunch of people completely separate from your family also wanted to go out and enjoy a meal in the nice weather. You had the ability to step away with your kid and let others around you go back to enjoying their experience. Not doing it is definitely AH behavior. You also escalated the situation with the guy who had a right to voice his feelings as you were probably ruining his meal and you insulted his dog. Definitely AH behavior as well. All of that unpleasentness could have been avoided by just stepping away for a second with your kid.", "NTA people with dogs who take them everywhere can be so impossible. The dog made your kid cry. Your kid wasn\u2019t crying for no reason. You could have reacted better but sounds like you were in a tough position. Situations are always way harder when your kid is crying.", "NTA. Where children should be and what to do when they cry can be a dicey sometimes, but here the dog\u2019s barking caused your baby to cry, so the dog owner has no justification here. Even without dog, he shouldn\u2019t do more than complain to restaurant. Unless they don\u2019t allow babies, it\u2019s the man\u2019s prerogative to stay or leave. If the restaurant thinks you\u2019re being too loud, they could ask you to leave. The low blows at your parenting are ridiculous.", "Dogs do not belong at restaurants period. If I want to eat with a dog I'd go to a kennel not a restaurant. Kids and babies are humans who eat food thus belong at restaurants. Nta. \n\nI'm getting very tired already of the warmer weather and entitled dog people bringing their barely trained dogs everywhere. Iv almost gotten bit 2x in 1 week both times by inattentive owners letting their dogs roam on long leashes not paying a care to them. The 2nd dog tried to take a bite out of my baby who's fingers were dangling from the pram AFTER I yelled at the lady to watch her dog who nipped at my leg as she walked past. That was a 2 for 1 special just today. \n\nIf your dog hasn't had exstensive training keep them on a short leash or keep them at home.", "ESH - He was an AH and so were you. I would have been on your side if you didn't blow up and call his dog shitty. Such an overreaction on both ends.", "Ugh, a crying kid at a restaurant and a parent not caring. YTA", "YTA, I\u2019m not a kid family. Stop ruining everyone\u2019s dinner.", "YTA and nobody wants to hear your darling angel cry for several minutes. Apparently the dog owner quieted his dog immediately. Which means he handled the situation.\n\nYou did not.\n\nOh and before you drink up all the NTA\u2019s you are receiving, these will melt away once your little prince turns 3 and is so accustomed to behaving badly that he runs around in a restaurant while you think \u201cit\u2019s cute\u201d.  \n\nYou are getting a pass because he\u2019s 10 months. Maybe you feel entitled because you believe nothing and nobody should tell you or your kid to stop doing something. It\u2019s too early to tell. You should have removed the crying kid from the other patrons. You could have taken him for a short walk for the crying duration.\n\nAway from the dog wouldn\u2019t have hurt.

People go to eat food and enjoy themselves not be disturbed by animals and crying.", "ESH, he shouldn\u2019t have said anything to you and you shouldn\u2019t have escalated so quickly.

I am a dog owner and dog lover but they do not have equal status.", "OK, I\u2019ll take the bullet here.\n\nBabies and dogs don\u2019t really need to be in restaurants\u2026unless it is like a Chuck E Cheese.  \n\nYes, I am a jerk.", "I'm sorry.

I dealt with the same issue when my youngest was smaller, she\u2019s 3 now and just starting to accept dogs. She loves to see them run around, when they\u2019re jumping and licking at her or barking loud it\u2019s another story.

Dogs have their own brains and even well-socialized dogs can have their moments. So can people. \n\nThen the baby began crying. Usually if the baby can't settle fairly quickly it's appropriate to take the kid somewhere else for a few minutes to let them calm down. There were other people there, uninvolved, who also probably didn't want to listen to the crying baby either. \n\nThen the dog owner went off the rails. His dog's behavior is what unsettled the baby, so he bears some responsibility here. He wasn't categorically wrong that they should have removed the baby from the area to help calm down but he was the wrong person to mention it given his involvement. \n\nAnd then it became a dick measuring contest between dad and dog owner. \n\nESH.

That usually (especially in a 10mo) is enough for them to go \"oooh, I see something new and different and I'm distracted from whatever made me cry\". It's not even about taking them to cry elsewhere - taking them elsewhere often stops them crying.", "Could you explain please why do people who aren\u2019t interested in dogs as pets, need to teach their children about all the different breeds and which breeds you don\u2019t run around and such?\n\n\n\nIsn\u2019t it the job of the \u201cresponsible \u201c dog owner to manage their pet and ensure it doesn\u2019t hurt or chase others? Say, the dog owner takes their dog to a park that allows dogs, shouldn\u2019t it be their responsibility to ensure their dog is under their control and not just randomly running after people?", "Yeah, that\u2019s why my vote was ESH/ slight YTA just because of OP escalating the situation when he is the one with the more annoying companion", "Didn't you know, there's a button we're supposed to press? It instantly makes them better! Ugh, I wish. Ppl suck.\nAnd the more these random ppl stress the parent out, the more upset the baby will be because they'll pick up on your anxiety or whatever emotion we're feeling.\nIf anyone ever shares the truck in instantly calming them down, message me! I, desperately, also want to know", "I've always wondered (no kids of our own): does [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kR3q9sXM7WA) actually work?  (The doctor himself says it only works up to about 3 months.)", "No issue with that. I paid more to fly with my children after all and should have expected more respect and care. I didn't choose the seat. The airline did.", "But we\u2019re not saying you shouldn\u2019t go to the restaurant. We\u2019re saying if your baby starts wailing and can\u2019t be consoled quickly, step outside with them until they\u2019ve calmed down. I would expect the same courtesy from someone taking a phone call or someone with a dog that won\u2019t stop barking. If you\u2019re disrupting others, you should do your best to remove yourself and the disruption until it passes. \n\nSo, no, we\u2019re not saying that people with children can\u2019t go out. But if you choose to have children - or take phone calls in public or bring your dog everywhere - you should accept that your outings may be interrupted or cut short.\n\nPeople shouldn\u2019t snap at parents the minute their kid starts crying or acting up. But nor should parents let their kid continue to do so in for an extended period of time when the solution is simply to pause the meal and take the kid out for a few minutes. Can\u2019t we all just extend a basic level of courtesy to each other?", ">So because people have children they can't go out? And before you say baby sitters, not everyone can afford them or has family to help.\n\nThen maybe they should reconsider going out, yes. The rest of us don't matter less because you chose to have a kid. \n\n> I know babies crying is annoying and can be frustrating for others, but ya know what? It's 1000x worse for parents.\n\nBullshit. It's not \"worse\" for you. It's your kid; you live with the screaming and can tune it out. I watch parents do so all the time. You having a kid doesn't automatically mean you're the worst off in every situation.\n\n>How about asking if they need a hand instead to see if they need anything that can help instead of making them feel worse?\n\n\"This person is ruining your night by refusing to remove their screaming child. Why don't you enable them?\"", ">Weddings are completely optional events, where they serve alcohol. Eating is not optional. Terrible comparison.\n\nWtf. Going to a restaurant is 100% optional", "Wedding completely optional.. not always, family weddings not optional, if my 10m old cried in a church i would leave with them, calm them down and return.\n\nEating in a restaurant is completely optional, always, Moving seats, going indoors, moving away from the trigger for the child crying is always an option.      \nJust as the dog owner calmed his dog, the parents could also have done so.   \nIt seemed to continue way beyond 30 secs of crying the way i read it, I would imagine the parents reaction to the dog was reinforcing the idea of fear in their child. It wasn't barking anymore, this was a perfect teaching opportunity to reassure the baby about the dog.", "Brunch at a nice restaurant is now not optional. I hate reddit for shining a light on the poo-pidity of the masses these days. I said poo-pidity mods, so pls dont ban me.", "I have a small well behaved dog that I walk on a very short lead. She isn't even as high as my knee and she can't get more than 3 feet away from me. 2 different children on 2 different occasions have literally run into traffic when they were startled to see her - note that they were just startled because she is small and quiet so they hadn't noticed her. Both kids were super lucky not to be hit by passing cars. \nMany different children have launched themselves at my dog when they see her and she has been startled.  Those kids were also very lucky that my dog is gentle because lots of dogs would have bitten or reacted badly to being jumped on/poked. \nThis is why teaching kids how to interact with dogs is important even if the parents don't have dogs. The kids with too much fear or not enough respect for dogs can behave erratically and put themselves in significant danger.", "And the guy complaining chose to bring his barking dog to a restaurant. Personally I find that 1000x more annoying than the baby. Dog barks are louder and more startling than a baby crying. If this guys dog couldn\u2019t handle other dogs in the area it shouldn\u2019t have been brought to a restaurant. Plenty of dog friendly parks that guy could have eaten at instead. Or just kept the dog at home.", "Trained support dogs don\u2019t bark at other dogs. If the dog barked it\u2019s not trained.", "I love dogs. I like dogs better'n I like most kids actually. I have no problem with support dogs. I have a problem with shitty entitled owners who dont control their dogs & expect everyone else to put up with them \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nAn *actual* support dog is trained *NOT* to randomly bark at other dogs in public because theyre actually working. If the dogs barking, it's not trained \n\nEntitled people are the worst, period. \nWhether thats entitled dog owners who think theyre precious baby should be put first no matter the situation or entitled parents that think everyone should put up with lil Jimmys tantrums... No one wants to deal with that shit \n\nYes crying babies are annoying but that baby was only crying after the dog came in barking & scared him", "100% this..\n\nThe dog was no longer barking, the parents did not like dogs and were not interesting in engaging with it to help eliminate the child's fear.   \nThey'll have left that day with the child remembering that a dog barking made mommy and daddy tense and worried..  not that they saw a quiet and well behaved dog for 99.9% of the time."]}
