We recently married in July. Hasn\u2019t  been a month yet.  I am 7 months  pregnant with our first child together. We are a blended family of 6. He has 3 kids, 2 of whom lives with us. \n\nMy husband sister(30 female) and her two kids (9f&5M) recently moved in with us. To begin, my husband never asked me if I was ok with her moving in. I found out through conversation with her. I can\u2019t tell you exactly why she\u2019s here but I\u2019m sure it\u2019s because she\u2019s a single mother and struggles. Our household was not the only or even best option. Their parents have a house with PLENTY of room.\n\nNow my issues! I tried discussing with my husband the living arrangements prior to her moving in. Our 3 kids all have their own bedroom. His sister is occupying our extra master bedroom. So she has plenty of space. My husband told our kids Saturday morning to pack their rooms up because everyone rooms would be changing. Our girls (15&12)would be moving into our teen son (16)room together, it\u2019s the biggest of the 3 and our son would be getting the 2nd biggest room while his niece and nephew get the smallest room. This is a decision that was NEVER discussed with me. Our girls  agreed to let the 9yr sleep with them on a weekly bassy while the 5 year old remains in the room with his mom. My husband said no. I suggested that his niece could stay in the room with my daughter and my daughter advised she\u2019s ok with that she just doesn\u2019t want to loose her room. He denied that request. He stated that his niece and nephew shouldn\u2019t be uncomfortable while living here. I feel completely uncomfortable and disrespected in HIS home.\n \nI packed my daughter room and she is now sleeping on the couch. I told him I would be moving because he is making decisions for our household as if it\u2019s just his. He responded I\u2019m overreacting! I am in the process of moving out. AITA because I don\u2019t think my kids should have to give their rooms up?", "created_utc": 1692639497, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15xedtl/aita_for_not_wanting_my_kids_to_give_up_their/", "score": 2080, "replies": ["NTA.

He needs to discuss these types of things with you AND your kids as it effects you all.\n\nIf he won't listen, perhaps contact your inlaws and see why they can't take their daughter and grand children in.\n\nDon't back down with your husband on this. He is very in the wrong, has shows he doesn't care to ask your opinion and when he has it has shown he won't take it into consideration. He is also disadvantaging his own children and risks making them feel like they've lost their home.\n\nGood luck.", "NTA, it's barely been a month and your husband is disrespecting you and prioritising his blood relatives over your children and YOU, his own wife.\nAsk yourself what he's going to be like in a year, or ten. \nYou're not overreacting. You need to leave with your children and find your own space, where they and you can be comfortable. Your husband's house IS NOT that space.\nI know that you might be reluctant to move out after only a month, or to give up on so new a marriage (if you decide the marriage is untenable), but you have ONE life and it's far too short, for you to waste giving your energy to a man who obviously does not consider you an equal partner in your marriage.\nMy advice: GET OUT NOW AND STAY GONE, if not for your own happiness and peace of mind, then for your kids.", "Nta", "NTA. That should have been a joint decision to allow someone else to move in, and certainly a family decision about where they will sleep. Sounds like his parents have plenty of vacant bedrooms, I\u2019d take all the kids and go stay with them.", "NTA. Neither you nor your kids should feel uncomfortable living in your home. He absolutely should've discussed his sister moving in and changing bedrooms around with you.\n\nYou're absolutely not overreacting. He's being completely disrespectful to you and your kids.", "NTA. \n\n>I told him I would be moving because he is making decisions for our household as if it\u2019s just his.\n\nThis is the bigger problem. Your husband doesn't see you as an equal partner, he sees you as a subservient. He thinks that what he says goes, and that you just have to accept it. Well, you don't.", "If my wife did any of this she would get a divorce faster then the sister could unpack her stuff.", "ESH.\n\nThe reshifting of the room assignments seems reasonable. Your husband should have talked to you about it. If this is the only hiccup, your deciding to move out is extreme. \n\nI wonder if cooler heads would allow a conversation to work it out?", "And his own kids!", "Why is the amount of children they have of any concern to you? Rude", "Not too late to annul that marriage.", "She\u2019s 7 months pregnant", "That might be tricky since they\u2019re his bio kids, not hers.", "\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23", "That still only comes out to 5, as baby isn't born yet. Husband, wife, one child of husband who doesn't live with them and two who do. Honestly I wouldn't care if it weren't for the fact that the numbers were clearly wrong and completely distracted me from why she came here in the first place.\n\nIt's just confusing for readers and I feel may have distracted from OP's point more than she wished. I legitimately had to scroll back up to re-read the situation so I could say NTA with certainty, all because the numbers *immediately* commanded my entire attention.", "What context exactly?  They've been together for 5 years, presumably living together for some of that time and living comfortably until the sister **just now** gets moved in!\n\nTell us why exactly in this context OP was irresponsible for OP to get pregnant?", "She also has a daughter. She says \u201cour kids\u201d but then later also says \u201cmy daughter\u201d a lot. So her husband has a boy and a girl, plus another kid elsewhere, and she has a daughter. That\u2019s 6.", "\" I *feel completely uncomfortable and disrespected in HIS home*.\" HIS home? Not \"our\" home? Why are you with him if you have no rights, he gives you no consideration and  even his sister gets treated better than you? NTA", "NTA\n\nGet out of there. He doesn\u2019t respect you. Don\u2019t put yourself or your children through that toxicity.", "NTA and I don't think this will work, he doesn't care about your opinions at all, he only wants to do whatever he decided alone, do you want to keep married this way?", "NTA. Kick your sil out of the master and move in there with your daughter until you can find somewhere to move. SIL can move in your husband\u2019s room", "Esh. Youre married, you're supposed to be a partnership. It sounds like both of you are more interested in getting what you want, as opposed to what is best for your marriage. If yoh don't learn to communicate with each other better and respect each other, your relationship is ultimately doomed.", "One question, who is paying for the house?", "New PREGNANT wife. Also, where is the baby supposed to go once they're too big/old to sleep in mom and dad's room? Yes, I know that's a decent amount of time until it's an issue, but it feels like the situation with SIL living there is going to be fairly long-term. None of the older kids is going to want to share with a baby.", "And I'm sorry, the sister took their master room? Oh hell no.", "They soon have 5 kids total... that is not nessarily a shocking amount in my opinion  O.o they clearly have the finacial means- the space, etc \n\n\nSIL and her kids are the problem.", "Two teen girls sharing a room is reasonable?", "I know a woman whose stepdaughter asked to live with her after she divorced her dad. He was *that* bad.", "7 months is a bit too far along to avoid the other logistical issue though", "He has 3 kids, 1 of which doesn't live with them, she has a daughter, blended family of 6 but only 5 in the household.", "She has a bio daughter she's moving out with", "I'm still confused.  She says blended family but she has no kids yet", "Don\u2019t feed the troll", "You know, I think you're probably right. I think all the confusion is that OP put a section at the top that references kids in the home, and when she said \"our 3 kids\" in the third paragraph I assumed that the kid that didn't live with them still had a room in the home.\n\nShe doesn't reference her daughter specifically until much later in the post, which only seems to have confused the situation farther. I assumed she was talking about one of husband's girls when she got to that part.\n\nOP, how many kids in total do YOU AND your husband have, not counting the baby that's brewing? I know it's not the most important thing on your mind at the moment, but if you could clarify the number of kids and room situations I think this can all be resolved.", "I'm still confused too, but another person who replied to me seemed to have a good answer. It appears that OP has a daughter *herself* (as in not her husband's) which she simply failed to include in the opening part describing the kids that live with her.\n\nShe does mention \"my daughter\" a lot later in the post, and assuming the child who *doesn't* live with them doesn't have a permanent room in the home then her daughter is the extra in her example.\n\nI asked for further clarification, but I'm not sure it'll come.", "The whole point of the post is that she has a kid that's getting fucked over and they're moving out. Read.", "What the.", "Who moves another family in after less than a month of marriage? I would never want to move in with any relatives if the had only been married a month I feel like I might get psychologically scarred. Also doesn\u2019t he not realize stress can cause miscarriages or birthing complications? I personally find this stupid not to mention detrimental to all the kids.", "Nta.  Stick up for the kids, he won't", "The fact that he did not even tell you she decided she was moving in, let alone even ask your thoughts on it, show he doesn't see you as a partner. Having someone move in to your home is not something you can decide on your own when you are a couple. \n\nAnd then to rearrange the kids rooms, indicating that his sister being there is a long term thing, is just more of the same. \n\nHe did not consult you on someone moving in, so yo moving out is not something he gets an opinion about. \n\nNTA", "does he think he is a king?", "No, you are moving out because he is a bully and disrespecting you and the kids. NTA. Move out with those kiddos.", "Sounds like he\u2019s trying to make them comfortable and when folks become comfortable they NEVER leave! Obviously, he talked about this with your SIL. I don\u2019t care how big of an argument it becomes, \u201cwe\u2019re not playing musical chairs with the rooms and she has 90 days.\u201d", "NTA.", "NTA \n\nThis is ridiculous. He\u2019s not treating like a partner at all. Definitely love if he\u2019s not willing to include in important conversations regarding your children and home\n\nEDIT: also, if you\u2019re in the US. In most states your daughters can\u2019t share a room with your son if they\u2019re past the age of 8. I know in my state it\u2019s illegal because they don\u2019t want cases of incest happening.", "He has 3 kids (one doesn\u2019t live there) and she has a daughter. Plus she\u2019s pregnant with their child", "If she takes her kids that won't be the issue. Generally the issue with that is when men move out of the family home, it gives more weight to the argument that the mother is the primary caretaker. Thus the mother is usually allowed to remain in the primary home with the children, to minimize disruption to them. The father has already severely disrupted their lives by moving in his sister and her kids and making everyone move rooms. If the house is fully  marital property, They're simply going to consider who is providing the children with a more stable situation. In this case, because of the husband's actions, the wife removing the children from the home was probably the best thing for them since otherwise they would be left with a father and an aunt who don't seem to care about their needs. \n\nThere's also the fact that it sounds like the father owned this home before the marriage. If that's the case, regardless of if the wife stays or leaves, he will most likely be granted the house. Even if the house is determined to be now converted to marital property and the wife is owed half the value that the marriage put into it, they're not going to make him move out of the house that he lived in before they got married.", "What are you basing that on? I read it again carefully and it really isn\u2019t clear. She refers to all three kids as \u201cmy kids,\u201d \u201cmy daughters,\u201d \u201cmy daughter,\u201d and said that \u201cI am in the process of moving out.\u201d She also just has three comments, none of which mention which kids are whose.", "They're a blended family of 6, he has 3 kids, 6-3=3, him and her equals 2, 3-2=1, 1 must be her child. Plus she says she's packed her daughters room up and she's currently on the couch until they move out."]}
