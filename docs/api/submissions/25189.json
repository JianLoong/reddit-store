We recently married in July. Hasn\u2019t  been a month yet.  I am 7 months  pregnant with our first child together. We are a blended family of 6. He has 3 kids, 2 of whom lives with us. \n\nMy husband sister(30 female) and her two kids (9f&5M) recently moved in with us. To begin, my husband never asked me if I was ok with her moving in. I found out through conversation with her. I can\u2019t tell you exactly why she\u2019s here but I\u2019m sure it\u2019s because she\u2019s a single mother and struggles. Our household was not the only or even best option. Their parents have a house with PLENTY of room.\n\nNow my issues! I tried discussing with my husband the living arrangements prior to her moving in. Our 3 kids all have their own bedroom. His sister is occupying our extra master bedroom. So she has plenty of space. My husband told our kids Saturday morning to pack their rooms up because everyone rooms would be changing. Our girls (15&12)would be moving into our teen son (16)room together, it\u2019s the biggest of the 3 and our son would be getting the 2nd biggest room while his niece and nephew get the smallest room. This is a decision that was NEVER discussed with me. Our girls  agreed to let the 9yr sleep with them on a weekly bassy while the 5 year old remains in the room with his mom. My husband said no. I suggested that his niece could stay in the room with my daughter and my daughter advised she\u2019s ok with that she just doesn\u2019t want to loose her room. He denied that request. He stated that his niece and nephew shouldn\u2019t be uncomfortable while living here. I feel completely uncomfortable and disrespected in HIS home.\n \nI packed my daughter room and she is now sleeping on the couch. I told him I would be moving because he is making decisions for our household as if it\u2019s just his. He responded I\u2019m overreacting! I am in the process of moving out. AITA because I don\u2019t think my kids should have to give their rooms up?", "created_utc": 1692639497, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15xedtl/aita_for_not_wanting_my_kids_to_give_up_their/", "score": 125, "replies": ["NTA. As you said, you're a blended family of 6 and he's acting like a family of 1. He's paying more deference to his sister and her kids than his new wife.  You are doing the right thing by taking a stand and showing him this will not be tolerated.", "NTA Is your husband your partner or Lord and Master? Who the heck moves in another family into a martial home without discussing it with their spouse. If it's his way or the highway, I'd take the highway too. He sounds insufferable.", "NTA.  Continue moving out.  Your husband is a controlling AH and you will never get your house back from his sister.", "Yikes. NTA. \n\nThe red flags are waving like a wacky waving inflatable arm flailing tube man outside of a used car dealer. \n\nGood luck to you with that new baby if he is already doing this 1 month after marriage. You're married. You both should be involved in any decision regarding your shared living space... again, yikes.", "NTA he shouldn't be making these decisions without speaking to you first and his sister should be moving out way before your children have to make sacrifices.", "NTA, why is he deciding everything on his own? And ehy did he move a family in your house without consulting? His sister should go live with their parents if they need so much space, all of your kids need to move for", "NTA. Moving his sister and her kids into your family home is a major decision that you should have been included in making.", "NTA.  He is 100% in the wrong and there is no way his sister should never moved in without your agreement.", ">My husband sister(30 female) and her two kids (9f&5M) recently moved in with us.\n\nIn the famous words of founding Father Ben Franklin\n\n**Fish and visitors smell after 3 days**\n\n>To begin, my husband never asked me if I was ok with her moving in.\n\nYour husband needs an education about treating his wife and family better.\n\nNTA", "NTA.\n\nWow, sorry the wedding already happened. This will not be a good marriage since he's not a partner. You are not overreacting; he's making unilateral decisions without your input, including having other HUMANS MOVE IN WITHOUT A DISCUSSION.\n\nGiving up the rooms is only part of it, his inability to acknowledge you are rightfully entitled to be part of major decisions is entirely wrong of him.\n\nLegit red flags.", "NTA\n\nHe should not have moved her and her kids at the expense of YOUR own family\n\nAnd you are completely justified moving out. He is the one being disrespectful", "NTA.   This is not okay to make familial decisions that are one sided.   You are his partner, not his chattel", "INFO: Does he own the house or do you own the house together? Does he have a habit of making big decisions without consulting you?\n\nIf he owns the house, he's still in the wrong, but you just have less of a leg to stand on. \n\nObviously, no matter what, you two are married and need to be making these decisions together. The fact that he steamrolled you and didn't even blink an eye doesn't bode well for this marriage. He's deciding who lives in your house, where they sleep, how long they stay, etc.. ALL of this should be a *joint* decision. If he's not okay with that and keeps insisting you're overreacting, start thinking about moving out for good. He has control issues and that never ends well.", "Sounds like one of those creeps whose family of origin always outranks family by marriage. A spouse is not a partner in the Western sense of the word. NTA", "NTA - but are you sure marrying this man is the right thing for you and your children? Your kids aren't luggage cases that can be moved around to make space for other people. You guys should be spending this time bonding as a family and learning to live with one another.\n\nAs an outsider looking in, I don't think your children are valued members of the family. I totally understand it is difficult to blend families. My son and I moved overseas to be with my husband and it was difficult to adjust, however, my husband always made it a point for my son to feel comfortable and welcomed. I never even had to make a peep. I think that if you let this go on, one day you will regret allowing your kids to be treated in this manner.\n\nEdit: spelling", "Time to get an annulment.  \n\nNTA", "NTA. He made two major decisions without even asking your opinion. It's obvious that he sees it as his house and he shouldn't have to ask you what you think.", "NTA.  Dude made a big decision without talking to the rest of the household and double down on it when pretty much everyone else living there said no.  Some might see moving out as an overreaction but this dude needs the shock to his system.  If you end up talking to the sister, remind her that your decision isn't about her, its about her brother's unacceptable behavior.", "NTA. Not even a little bit.", "NTA Marriage is a partnership but he didn't ask to you about his sister beforehand and you've had no input on the way rooms are arranged. If this was originally his house before you got married and still is just his name on the title, you need to make clear that while it might be his house, the space inside the walls is also your home and you will be treated as an equal partner -- or else.", "NTA. I don't think moving out is an overreaction. A tad avoidant, certainly, but it is a reasonably peaceful move.\n\nYour husband should never have made either large decision without consulting with you.", "*I feel completely uncomfortable and disrespected in HIS home.*\n\nNTA. It is not HIS home, it is your joint home. He is married and should not be making unilateral decisions. \n\nYou did not over-react. If he can't see how wrong he is, you are better off without him.", "Best to get out now, because his behavior will NEVER change. He's finally showing you who he really is. NTA", "NTA.  It's not about the kids rooms,  It's about him making every decision as if he's the only one in the house.  Not happening.   You didn't agree to the sister moving in,   You didn't agree to the room changes and he won't compromise.   This is not a marriage it's a dictatorship. Be done with him.", "NTA\n\nIt depends on who owns the house. If you both do, then the decision on who can live there and who sleeps where, is for both of you to discuss.\n\nIf he owned the house before you married and moved in, then while he SHOULD be discussing with you all decisions, depending on the laws of your State, he might legally be permitted to make those decisions (I say this from experience with my ex) -- even if it doesnt mean he is morally right in making those decisions.\n\nRegardless of either of the two above statements, when you become a FAMILY you discuss things with each other that will impact the entire family, and him unilaterally making those decisions (and then gaslighting you by saying you are overreacting) is an AHole move (and huge red flags!)\n\nI would move out, with my kids and file for divorce.", "NTA.  Your husband is running your house like a dictatorship.  You are apparently allowed no input.  I would have flipped out when he told his sister and kids they could move in and he didn't even bother to tell you much less discuss it.  Hill to die on.", "NTA, but does your husband frequently make big decisions without consulting you? Did he even say how long they are staying and whether they are responsible for contributing to the household financially or in other ways like sharing cooking, cleaning, or other chores? Are you expected to pay for them and take on the responsibility for extra persons?\n\nYou are NOT overreacting. His sister and her kids are GUESTS. Your kids were there first, and they shouldn't be impacted by your husband's SOLO decision to move his sister and her kids in. If anything, she should share a room with her own kids. You've offered plenty of concessions, all of which were rejected.", "NTA, and get out of this mistake of a marriage as soon as possible. Your husband has no respect for you or your family.", "NTA. He's controlling. Divorce him", "NTA, F all that,  moving out was the best decision you could make.", "NTA. It makes no sense that HE is making unilateral decisions that effect everyone, especially with it even discussing it with you. Absolutely not okay.", "NTA. Husband is one, totally.", "NTA. If he doesn't want you to leave, he'll start listening to you and stop making g edicts.", "NTA. You have a *massive* husband problem though. This is some unacceptable shit from him: \"To begin, my husband never asked me if I was ok with her moving in.\" You're wise to move out", "You're NTA. If your husband is going to make unilateral decisions that have an impact on the entire household, you can do the same.", "NTA. He is a big AH for doing this without your ok and there are huge red flags here about how unbalanced your relationship is going to be if you stay. Divorce him!", "NTA - This dude sounds like a real Tyrant and doesn't give a crap about anyone's opinion but his own.", "NTA\n\nIt sounds like he decided that now you are married he is the lord and master and everyone will do whatever he wants.  \n\nYou either stand up to him and deny his right to rule, or you pack up and move out.   Then, you can hit him up for child support for the child you are carrying.  Since it sounds like you have a good relationship with his children, you can tell them they are always free to call you if needed.\n\nGood luck", "Nta. Holy crap! Why didn't you immediately kick the sister out! No discussion first? He can go too!", "I\u2019m sorry you have to go through this while pregnant. NTA! And you did right by leaving and not putting up with that, I mean 9 people in a house and you have to shut up because it\u2019s his house? Nah nah, if he doesn\u2019t understand why you left, being married doesn\u2019t sound promising\u2026", "NTA - sounds like your husband is dating his sister! Very weird behavior!", "1. Did he marry you or his sister? If the answer to #1 is the latter, and it sounds like at least in the communication department it might be, it might be time to get your kids out of this situation.", "BREAKING NEWS! Family with large amount of children and red flags is pregnant. ESH.", "NTA - he said it himself, it\u2019s his house.\n\nHe\u2019s been dictating the occupancy.\n\nHe\u2019s decided room orders.\n\nIt\u2019s all his. And his actions reflect that.\n\n**You deserve a space that\u2019s yours too, since apparently this home is only his.**\n\nHis sister was fine before.  She needs to figure it out, be absolutely doesn\u2019t get to make all of these unilateral decisions.", "NTA\n\nDude is thinking he is the only one whose decision matters.  He's taking better care of his sister and her kids than he is his own wife, her kids, and his kids.  Hubby has been watching a bit too much of the 'Hub.", "INFO: how many & which kids in this description are yours and not his?", "Simply put you're NTA. Not only did your kids get shuffled into a box in your own house, but it happened without  you having ANY knowledge or input into it. I get that your husband wants to help his sister feel comfortable but that shouldn't come at the cost of you or your kids' comfort.", "INFO where is the baby going to go? \n\nAlso- you have 3 step kids and one on the way, correct?", "INFO: Does he own the house?\n\nHe's making a lot of unilateral decisions.\n\nNTA", "NTA But there\u2019s way bigger issues going on here. Your husband doesnt respect you at all making these decisions all on his own.", "NTA - If he is going to prioritize his sister and niblings over his wife and unborn child then it's going to be a really short marriage.", "NTA, good mama bear. I wouldn't want my kids to give up their rooms either. Definitely wouldn't be ok with wife making that decision on her own.", "NTA.  Did he forget you live there too?", "Good thing is that it\u2019s not even a month so maybe an annulment can work", "She is already married. Maybe it can be annuled."]}
