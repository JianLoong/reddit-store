We recently married in July. Hasn\u2019t  been a month yet.  I am 7 months  pregnant with our first child together. We are a blended family of 6. He has 3 kids, 2 of whom lives with us. \n\nMy husband sister(30 female) and her two kids (9f&5M) recently moved in with us. To begin, my husband never asked me if I was ok with her moving in. I found out through conversation with her. I can\u2019t tell you exactly why she\u2019s here but I\u2019m sure it\u2019s because she\u2019s a single mother and struggles. Our household was not the only or even best option. Their parents have a house with PLENTY of room.\n\nNow my issues! I tried discussing with my husband the living arrangements prior to her moving in. Our 3 kids all have their own bedroom. His sister is occupying our extra master bedroom. So she has plenty of space. My husband told our kids Saturday morning to pack their rooms up because everyone rooms would be changing. Our girls (15&12)would be moving into our teen son (16)room together, it\u2019s the biggest of the 3 and our son would be getting the 2nd biggest room while his niece and nephew get the smallest room. This is a decision that was NEVER discussed with me. Our girls  agreed to let the 9yr sleep with them on a weekly bassy while the 5 year old remains in the room with his mom. My husband said no. I suggested that his niece could stay in the room with my daughter and my daughter advised she\u2019s ok with that she just doesn\u2019t want to loose her room. He denied that request. He stated that his niece and nephew shouldn\u2019t be uncomfortable while living here. I feel completely uncomfortable and disrespected in HIS home.\n \nI packed my daughter room and she is now sleeping on the couch. I told him I would be moving because he is making decisions for our household as if it\u2019s just his. He responded I\u2019m overreacting! I am in the process of moving out. AITA because I don\u2019t think my kids should have to give their rooms up?", "created_utc": 1692639497, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15xedtl/aita_for_not_wanting_my_kids_to_give_up_their/", "score": 883, "replies": ["NTA.

Get out and don't look back.", "NTA- If he wants to share his life with his sister and not discuss any of that with his wife first then she can be the replacement without the benefits. \"Trash goes out on Tuesday, Electric is due the 1st of each month and don't forget to check the mail.\"", "Info: the house was, by any chance, received as inheritance? Because he\u2019s the son, he got the house, despite his sister?", "NTA. He sounds like a dick. Why should your kids suffer because his sister can't get her own place? Why do you have to suffer because of this? Her and her kids should all share a room and be grateful. I wouldn't let people move rooms if they were letting me stay in their house. That's so incredibly rude and complete entitlement imo. I'd be pissed if this was me.", "NTA", "Just tell him you don\u2019t want his ex there", "YTA\nWhy are you staying quiet and allowing this.  At the end of the day, you are a willing participant in uprooting your family.  \n\nOP needs to tell the SIL no and tell her to figure out her situation.

He doesn't respect her as a person.", "You married him", "This sounds like a messy and horrible situation to find yourself in while pregnant. Provided you didn\u2019t accidentally misconstrue something in these conversations, I think you\u2019re NTA. \n\nHopefully you\u2019re early enough in your marriage that divorce could be easy, but maybe you can talk this out and try to cool things off.

I think you're right to move out. Not only did he decide the room arrangements without discussing with you, he invited his sister and kids to live there without asking you. It's a bad sign of things to come, as far as I can see.", "NTA at all.\n\nAlso I'm rather surprised that your husband managed to go for five years without showing his controlling asshole tendencies.

I get that some men see themselves as \"man of the house\" in terms of decisions but the way you're framing the story is that he didn't discuss anything with you at all, I'd say having the sister move in without prior discussion is even more egregious than the children changing rooms without discussion.\n\nIf it's his home originally I get that he might feel entitled to make some of the decisions, but without prior discussion just shows total lack of respect and demonstrates he's a terrible communicator.", "NTA. \nHe isn't consulting you at all.", "Divorce! NTA", "NTA. This is something that should have been discussed between you and him before his sister ever moved in. Also wtf.

I hope op stands her ground cause it\u2019s just going to get more cramped after the baby is born.", "If she moves out now, it may difficult for her to get it back if they divorce.
