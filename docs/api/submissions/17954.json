As long as you participated in the activities, you were a part of the event.

Haley's behavior is extremely problematic. \n\nCalling you out (incorrectly) as \"super rude\" is a rudeness itself.  You did her no harm. It's not as if she noticed during dinner that you only had a drink and encouraged you to have some fruit or whatever, so we can't think of her as a keen hostess.  \n\nTrying to tell you what you should have done instead (again, incorrectly) is also rude and bad boundaries.  We can't change the past, berating you is pointless, and telling other adults how to order and what to eat is ludicrously bad manners.\n\nTrying shame you with what other people will think is far out of line.  Some people have guilt and shame issues and could suffer a real injury being berated that way.\n\nBut the kicker is trying to threaten you with public perception of disordered eating.  That is unacceptable on so many levels.  \n\nIf you did have an eating disorder, she wouldn't just be pushing your buttons; she'd be mashing your keypad.  Eating disorders are one of the conditions most likely to end in death.  It's not a joke.\n\nIf you did have an eating disorder, it would be a diagnosable condition that spans physical and mental illness, both protected under the Americans With Disabilities Act, potentially violating your rights and possibly exposing the employer to liability. \n\nHaley might have felt embarrassed for making a thoughtless choice of restaurant.  Maybe she was trying to provoke you so she could have a fight and work out her feelings.  Maybe she just has terrible boundaries.

Then people would really notice something off, though I'm sure they know why you weren't eating. It's almost impossible to hide that you're vegan when socializing (ppl claim vegans just can't help but bring it up, but then they bring us to BBQs and roll their eyes when we can't eat anything)\n\nAlso, as a vegan, I can relate and it's kinda silly how sensitive non-vegans get to the fact that we don't bend our ethics in order to accommodate their feelings around food. My work just sent me a thank you gift in the mail, non-vegan brownies, and my coworkers know I'm vegan so they immediately said they were sorry I got a gift I can't enjoy and I said, no problem, I have non-vegan friends that I can give them to and it's the thought that counts. But if they had said \"just eat them to make us feel better, it was a gift\", I'd question how it could be a gift to me to make me uncomfortable and put me in this situation over a brownie. The same goes for the gift of your company-paid meal that wasn't really an option to you. The real gift is the social connection anyway, so Haley needs to get over her failure at choosing an accommodating restaurant and do better next time.", "NTA. There was no problem at all. She's creating a problem. Sheesh", "NTA", "NTA, it's no ones business if you eat or not? I mean I dont understand how this is affecting her? Either way, she should mind her business", "NTA. Never adjust your beliefs \"so no one would complain\" fuck that.", "You should make a complaint about her to your superior. Screw the group complaining. \n\nNTA", "No you don't have to order but it's rude of her to use the company card and exclude you from dinner. That's a HR issue", "NTA.  You followed your own dietary regimen of which Haley was aware.  You were a good sport in my opinion.  \n\nLet's say you did order, even a side, and didn't eat it.  People were going to talk no matter what - so let them talk and you saved the company wasted $$.\n\nIf this has happened multiple times, a visit to HR might be in order.", "NTA. It's no one else's business what you do and do not eat.", "Definitely NTA and I would have done the same as you! But she\u2019s made herself look ignorant twice, once for thinking a vegan would enjoy food at a BBQ place, and again for suggesting people would think you had an eating disorder. The latter is a particularly gross thing to say to someone (it smacks of ableism and seems to suggest you are seeking attention on yourself by faking a condition), I\u2019m stunned.", "I'd say NTA, but I'm suspicious, because what sort of restaurant doesn't have at least one vegan side dish? I haven't encountered that before.", "> If she's going to get pissed at you for not eating, she needed to ~~choose a restaurant that served food you could eat~~ *see a therapist because that's none of her goddamn business*.\n\nNobody is obliged to eat anything at any time that they don't want to, and getting mad at someone for not eating is literal insanity.", "The more I think about this, the more I agree. Telling someone after a work event that they should have eaten something and now appear to have an eating disorder is definitely not okay, and HR should at least be aware. That way, if it happens again or if people actually start spreading rumors about OP and saying they have an eating disorder, they'll know where it all started.", "She chose it on purpose. She\u2019s probably mad that 0P didn\u2019t get all pissy about it being at a barbecue restaurant.", "There's a BBQ place near me that my parents love, so I take them when they're visiting. I'm vegetarian, not vegan, but even so I can only eat a few of the sides (salad, mac & cheese, coleslaw). Even stuff you may assume is safe (baked beans, corn bread) are commonly made with animal fat at BBQ places, so I don't blame OP at all for not taking a chance. A BBQ restaurant is definitely not the place to take a vegan if you expect them to eat.", "> Haley might have felt embarrassed for making a thoughtless choice of restaurant.\n\nExactly. Some people have really ridiculous defense mechanisms. \"Oh shit I stupidly picked a BBQ restaurant when there's a vegan in the group - better start trouble to shift the blame to someone else!\"", "You\u2019re probably right. I had no idea how restrictive veganism can be for \u2018going out\u2019 eating until a friend of mine went vegan and we basically couldn\u2019t visit any of our favourite restaurants anymore. Most restaurants where I am cater to vegetarians, but not vegans, which totally sucks. Assume she\u2019s just ignorant and give her a cheat sheet\u2026 or better yet, a list of local restaurants that cater properly to vegans. If she *still* books places that suck for you, *then* you can be sure she\u2019s just an asshole!", "And the fact that it WAS a work function just makes it worse.   If it was just a social gathering, work friends getting together and paying for themselves, it would be different.  The fact that they're writing off the expenses as a work event means the organizer as an obligation to ensure that all employees are able to eat.  Haley was provided with OP's dietary restrictions and ignored them.  OP chose not to make a fuss, and is now being harassed about her participation.  I would definitely talk to HR.", "You got it.  \n\nI don't know if Haley was raised with pressure to be perfect (\"I feel bad about being an A-hole but I can't admit failure and so will blame you for being too sensitive\") or if she is simply immature, not examining her feelings of guilt / embarrassment over inviting a vegan to a BBQ party, or fear of making a bad impression at her new job, but simply punishing the victim for provoking her guilt rather than taking responsibility for what she's guilty of.  \n\nI don't have time to make a butterfly meme asking \"Is this transference?\", but.", "Oh, she is embarrassed, a lot,  but she prefered to blame OP for that, to relieve herself of that feeling.", "Catering to vegans is extremely difficult and expensive for a typical restaurant. Even oils and seasonings they use may not be vegan. Everything must be checked and monitored at the source to be truly vegan, just like kosher. And it requires meaningful training of all the supply buyers and cooks to understand. Just throwing boiled rice on a plate may suit vegan, but it\u2019s not respectfully vegan. Have a little patience for restaurants, while it\u2019s your choice to support those that do invest in making the grade.", "it is a taste preference. I love sushi but after switching to mostly plant-based I am not interested in sushi without fish. I just don't want it. If I was in a group that went I would probably pre-eat and not eat there. I am also fine with not ordering food when I don't want it. It took a long time to break away from all the unhealthy food \"rules\" like clean your plate, or social pressures to try everything or always eat when others do. I cook ALL of our food and sometimes sit at dinner with my partner and kids and have a glass of wine or water as I am just not hungry and won't force myself to eat for some social reason.", "What oil is nor vegan??", "Wow, I had no idea it was that hard for restaurants!"]}
