Do not go to the movies. If I want to watch a movie that bad get a sitter. You did a good thing, what's one mom compared to numerous customers complaining and possibly demanding refunds?", "NTA, if I pay a small fortune to see a movie in the theater, I expect to be able to watch it without listening to a screaming baby or unruly toddlers.  I'd be one of the people making a complaint.", "LOL\n\nSeriously, though, very young babies often sleep right through movies, especially if it's a \"sensory\" showing when the theater turns the volume down a tad. I have no problem with parents who bring babies to movies, as long as they understand that crying babies should be *immediately* taken out of the theater.", "In Australia we have designated Cry Baby movie sessions where mums can all bring their babies, and they can cry as much as they want. \nGenerally most of the babies sleep.", "Plus wouldn't a babysitter for two hours cost less than buying all those brats' tickets?", "Because some lazy moms ignore their kids. They straight up tune them out.", "I tend to fall asleep during movies, even ones I want to see.\nSomething about disengaging my brain results in nap time.", "I took my kids to see How to Train Your Dragon 2 in the theater and my then 5 year-old slept the whole time! I joke that it\u2019s the most expensive nap she\u2019s ever had! Lol", "NTA. For your own benefit, check with your manager about the company policies. My boss likes to tell us to argue policy not argue with the customer. You handled this well.", "NTA\n\nThe mother sounds entitled. Who brings a baby AND a toddler to a movie????\n\nYou did good.", "NTA. She paid to see the movie. She did not pay to ruin the movie for everyone else.", "Nta she did pay and said she really wanted to see the movie, but other people paid too who not only wanted to see the movie but hear it also.", "And you gave the money back, so financially nothing is different. She didn\u2019t lose anything except showing people she\u2019s a bad mom. \n\nNTA", "NTA. Other people also paid money to go to the movies and they deserve to see the movie without being disrupted by screaming children. You refunded her money.", "NTA\n\nYes, that woman paid money to come there. And so did all the other people who were bothered by her loud, annoying children.", "NTA.  This is standard protocol, and I have been the parent to take their screaming baby out of the theater before.", ">they all said that was a huge asshole move since she paid money to come there\n\nThis is really an indictment of the education system where you live that you have that many stupid people living with you. \n\n1) She paid money for the cost of the film only.  She did not pay for babysitting or being disruptive  2) Other attendees also paid money to watch the film, *under the implied contract that the film is interruption free* 3) I highly doubt this mother will find other theaters are more receptive to her katzenjammer kids when she \"takes her money elsewhere\".\n\nHaving money to pay for something neither entitles you to preferred treatment, nor does it allow you to ruin the experiences of anyone else paying for the same thing.", "NTA, you are a steward of cinema. She is the asshole.", "NTA, her kids were disruptive to other paying customers.  If she is not going to keep her kid\u2019s quiet she can watch a movie at home.", "NTA Tell your roommate that ANYONE who pays to see a movie but then disrupts the movie repeatedly can be asked to leave. This woman was reimbursed for her ticket, so she is not out that money. She didn't pay for a babysitter, so she's not out that money.\n\nHowever all the other people who were in that theater... THEY PAID for their tickets and did not get reimbursed. They lost a lot of the enjoyment of seeing the movie and possibly lost hearing some of the dialogue or their focus on the plot or their ability to immerse themselves in the story. IT IS YOUR JOB to ensure that repetitive disrupters are removed from the theater.\n\nI missed a lot of movies in the theaters when my kids were young. You either arrange for a babysitter or wait till it comes out on dvd or streaming. Sure, that lady was bummed not to see the rest of the movie; one can sympathize that it can be tough to get an outing or a break as a parent of little ones. But it still doesn't entitle her to spoil the movie for everyone else who paid to see it.", "NTA.\n\nPut a movie on the TV and invite your roommates to watch it with you. Now scream like a baby through the entire movie. Ask them if they feel the same way after that.", "Nta. You did the right thing. I would have been so pissed if I were in that theater trying to enjoy the movie. But that is one reason why I prefer watching movies at home instead", "\"She paid money to come there\"\n\nSo did the other people going to see a movie. Why does she get priority?\n\nNTA", "YTA. Not for kicking the woman out, which was awesome, but for feeling bad about it.", "This comment reads like a Lemony Snicket novel and I love it", "Im so sorry i laughed so hard at the thought of a baby just slipping through the cracks. I\u2019m so sorry omg", "OP is NTA.\n\nHaving said that, I took my son to the movies in an infant carrier when he was a few months old, one that has the stadium seating so lots of room, and got some nasty comments from other people in my row. Those people wouldn't shut up the whole movie & my son never made a noise, slept through the whole thing. It's not about the kids, it's about the parents having some crazy entitlement. I have walked out of many places when my kids were little because of crying or bad behavior. Sucks to lose the money but better than being an asshole.", "I know there used to be mommies times during the day", "I used to cry in theaters and my mom would have to take me outside during the whole duration of the movie. \n\nI'm on the low autism spectrum, and suffer from OCD. I complained and cried about the theater being \"too loud.\" Today, I have thankfully grown out of most of my childhood issues.", "What world are you living in? All 3 of my babies always slept through movies. Same with my 2 nephews.

You don't get to ruin everyone else's night out because you couldn't find sitter.", "What kind of muppet beings a baby to a theatre?", "Back when my oldest was an infant, our city had a huge ice storm with power outages all over town. We went to the mall cuz we didn\u2019t want to hang out with a newborn in an unheated house in 25 degree weather, and ended up going to see a movie as well while we waited for the power to get turned on. We sat all the way at the back and would have immediately left if he started crying. I don\u2019t understand entitled people at all.", "If it weren't a baby crying, you'd ask any other person to leave if they were behaving similarly.", "The last 4 midnight showings I've been to had infants in them.\n\nNot a single one of them slept much at all. All of them cried during the movies. All of them pissed off a theater full of people.\n\nIt's the midnight release of a Marvel movie and you're bringing your newborn?

Why even risk the very high chance that the baby will cry at some point? Don't bring your baby to a theatre, no exceptions. There are some places you just can't go with a baby.

To the extent that all of my planning when flying with her from LA to Sydney (13 hours) was scheduling red eye flights so she would sleep most of the time. But I never would have brought my younger two as babies because they were average babies. The key is knowing your kid and being honest with yourself. And also, I think showing time is important too. Bringing a baby into a matinee with fewer people is different from a full price evening showing where people are presumably more likely to be trying to avoid babies. And of course, even if there's only one other person in the theater, if your baby cries, go outside until they calm down. Some theaters used to have special adjoining sound proof rooms for parents with babies that were nice.", "That's awesome!\n\nHell, Any movie over 2.5 hours need a potty break for us adults.", "This actually sounds ideal for some of us at all ages \ud83d\ude33"]}
