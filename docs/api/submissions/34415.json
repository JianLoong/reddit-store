Go to your vacation.", "NTA - send flowers if you want but that\u2019s your choice. Go on holiday and enjoy yourself.\n\nHaving lost my fair share of relatives some people are strange about funerals. If this is her first loss then it will be the most horrible loss to her (not saying it isn\u2019t ) and may struggle to not see why everyone isn\u2019t there (like you said you didn\u2019t know her)", "NTA- you already had these plans and paid for them and others are involved. If you can\u2019t go , let your brother know why, and do some nice things , send food , flowers , cards , visit with them when you return home , etc.", "NTA. Obviously the situation looks unsavory to anyone who doesn\u2019t have full context but try and enjoy your trip bc you already paid for it and planned it.

Do you own thing.", "NTA - no need to attend the funeral.\n\nI'd just arrange for some flowers to be sent to your SIL's house on the day.", "I'm sorry for their loss, but this really is their loss, not yours.

I was so emotionally broken, and\u2026just no. I turned off my phone and stayed with a friend because my sister would not stop telling me that it would look bad. And that\u2019s just dumb. Anyone keeping tabs on who shows like this needs better hobbies.\n\nAlso, grief is not a one day thing. You can be the real MVP in the weeks and months after vacation, when you drop off a casserole, or randomly send SIL memes to let her know you\u2019re thinking of her; maybe you\u2019ll even get her to smile.", "Nta, but Don't be surprised if the relationship with your SIL changes and not for the better, and possibly your brother changes as well. Go on the vacation because it's already paid for and you can't change things for funerals. But be a good brother. Call us and you condolences? Maybe send flowers or condolence card and if possible see if you can even FaceTime a little bit of the services so that least you're there for a little bit.\n\nBut if you do absolutely nothing and just go on vacation, there could be some ramifications for the negative.

Ofc, that's my culture and it may not be yours. And it's clear from your post that this was a holiday that was important to you. But there will be other holidays. There will only be one funeral, and that's the kind of thing that gets remembered for the rest of their lives by family members. \n\ntl;dr: I can sort of see your point but I do kind of think YTA.", "YTA slightly, because it isn\u2019t how well you knew the person who died, it\u2019s about how well you know and want to support your SIL and brother. \n\nYou have known your SIL for 8 years and might know her the rest of your life. If you have kids and some were to happen to you, she might raise your children and give your eulogy someday. You have/had a good relationship with her and she\u2019s important. \n\nThis is part of being an adult, choosing boring things that matter to other people over fun because those relationships are important.\n\nCould you make the wake if they are having one, it is often the evening before, and then go late to the event.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
