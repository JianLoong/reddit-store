I became suspicious when a quote from 'a source' in an article was almost word for word what another friend had said in our group chat. I got Faye to lie to Lisa and basically say that someone at the paper had confirmed it was her and she eventually admitted it. To Faye, she's never actually spoken to me since. \n\nAfter that I made it clear I wouldn't be attending any parties or anything that she was at which was relatively easy since everyone was kinda annoyed at her at the time and she basically just went away on her own. In the years since however, Faye and her have mended their friendship and she's recently begun dating someone within the wider friend group. \n\nSo our friend 'Sam's 40th is coming up and he's rented a massive house on a lake for a long weekend. Lisa isn't close to Sam but her bf is. He purposefully didn't include Lisa in the invite but the bf eventually asked which apparently led to a very awkward conversation. Sam asked me what I thought and I said that I respected his position and if he wanted her there I'd step back. No hard feelings. He said that he didn't want that, that he'd have her there for his friends sake so ideally we'd all be there together. I said no. Had it been a one off dinner or something I may have but I'm not willing to be stuck with this woman for 4 days.\n\nThere's some conjecture as to where the miscommunication lies but it transpired that before Sam had even spoken to me that the bf had told Lisa that she could come, leading Sam to force the bf to rescind the invitation. Now bf is upset and threatening to pull out. He even called me to 'straighten it all out' but what actually happened was he ambushed me 'that I need to grow up and not hold on to petty grudges'. The conversation descended quickly with him calling me a bitter child, a manipulative cxxt and destined to die alone. I honestly don't know how it got to that stage, I must've said no more than 10 words the entire call. \n\nI've spoken to some of my friends and whilst they're all disgusted with the things he said some did say that perhaps it was time to bury the hatchet with Lisa. Apparently Lisa has said that I should be over it by now and that I'm being unreasonable because I know that people will generally prioritise my attendance over hers. I know this probably sounds selfish but I don't really think that's my problem.\n\nSo AITA?\n\nETA: I've re-read it and it's not that clear but the bf in question is Lisa's, who is very close with Sam.

She is a bit of a coward for not contacting you in all these years and apologizing to you and to your ex through you!\n\n\nThe bf boyfriend is AH for going ballistic on you and using disgusting language!", "I had to read this twice, and I'm still not entirely sire what the situation is. :)", "You can be \"over\" it and still not want to be around her. NTA", "One breach of trust, and two  if they were together at the time it probably caused relationship issues.", "Lisa was the source - it sounds like she sold her knowledge of OP's ex to journalists.", "[deleted]", "Nta. She has no ethics. I would not want her near me.", "NTA. Lisa played ugly games. Got caught. Never apologized.  Shame on Lisa. Also, she\u2019s proven to be a snake, why does anyone want that around?", "NTA at all lisa and her bf are made for each other. Both awful.", "Agreed. Even if OP didn't care much about Lisa anymore, it's going to be hard to be comfortable around the boyfriend now even if she were to stay home. 4 days with someone who openly loathes you for not being a fan of their girlfriend isn't exactly an upgrade at this point.", "> now her bf from being able to attend parties.\n\n> You are saying \"its me or them\"\n\nWhere are you getting that she\u2019s saying anything about the boyfriend??", ">You have no obligation to forgive her\n\nMore than that, never forgive someone who won't admit that what they did was wrong.", ">FYI, \"quoting\" an inside source without permission or transparency is ILLEGAL.\n\nIt's not illegal in the UK, and I'd be shocked if it was illegal in the USA, where freedom of speech is one of the few freedoms they actually take seriously.", "NTA, she said things that where said in a group chat in trust and among friends, you don\u2019t go around telling people your friend\u2019s conversations. The people that say \u201cbury the hatchet\u201d didn\u2019t experience the problem first hand, also why would ANYONE want to be with someone who doesn\u2019t respect privacy and other people\u2019s conversations ? You have no obligation to forgive her, she never apologized, avoid people like that.", "Lisa betrayed you, didn\u2019t apologize, and you\u2019re expected to be the bigger person by again letting her get close to you for 4 days? No remorse, just a \u2018get over it cxxt!\u2019 From her bf?\n\nI hope you realize how ridiculous this all is. I wouldn\u2019t want to be around those two either. How are you expected to feel comfortable? Safe??\n\nNta", "Nta....but being the bigger person as well I'm giving you advice on how to move forward because trust me you do this enough and this person will eventually apologize: don't dictate or influence other people about who to invite to their events. 2ndly even if that person shows up your plan of action if you can game face on....shades and dressed up.  You don't have to look at that person. You don't have to engage that person. Live your life like you don't even know this person exsits. (My sister is a master at this and I've even seen an ex friend of hers in tears apologize to her for some crazy sh@t she pulled).", "You all need to grow up. \ud83d\ude44", "NTA - Lisa has never apologised and as you say, it\u2019s a 4 day trip not a quick dinner. On top of that, her boyfriend now also owes you an apology for how he spoke to you.", "How old are you all? This all sounds like high school rubbish.", "Nta", "This woman took things OP said in confidence and publicly distributed them for personal gain.\n\nIt isn\u2019t about liking her or being civil to her. It\u2019s basic self-protection to keep distance from someone who would use her like that.", "She sold info to the paparazzi that OP\u2019s ex was gonna be at a funeral so they could ambush him there, I wouldn\u2019t want someone like that in my company", "I read it wrong at first. Nah NTA. She's slimy.", "They found each other \ud83d\ude4f", "My first thought when I read it was, \"welp, they deserve each other.\"", "You can tell the bf that if Lisa publically apologizes for her betrayal you would be willing to consider burying the hatchet. But until Lisa steps up and admits what she did, makes amends to everyone involved, and sincerely apologizes, you don't see a path forward towards forgiveness. \n\nIf she is not willing to do that, then the relationship will remain as is, non-existent, and you will continue to avoid Lisa. And if that means others prefer you to come over Lisa, well, that says more about Lisa than it does you. \n\nAnd you did not pull rank. That would be you saying she can't come. You told the host that you don't want to spend time with Lisa, and are willing to step back, but they chose you over her. That is their choice. \n\nNTA", "Me either. I'm dyslexic so I thought I was just having a hard time processing but having reread it over and over again it still doesn't make sense. What exactly did this girl do?"]}
