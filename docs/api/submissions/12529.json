She went to school with one of my very best friends; 'Faye'. \n\nI'm not famous or anything but my ex is in some circles and 3 years ago, when we were still together, she sold a bunch of stories about him. I became suspicious when a quote from 'a source' in an article was almost word for word what another friend had said in our group chat. I got Faye to lie to Lisa and basically say that someone at the paper had confirmed it was her and she eventually admitted it. To Faye, she's never actually spoken to me since. \n\nAfter that I made it clear I wouldn't be attending any parties or anything that she was at which was relatively easy since everyone was kinda annoyed at her at the time and she basically just went away on her own. In the years since however, Faye and her have mended their friendship and she's recently begun dating someone within the wider friend group. \n\nSo our friend 'Sam's 40th is coming up and he's rented a massive house on a lake for a long weekend. Lisa isn't close to Sam but her bf is. He purposefully didn't include Lisa in the invite but the bf eventually asked which apparently led to a very awkward conversation. Sam asked me what I thought and I said that I respected his position and if he wanted her there I'd step back. No hard feelings. He said that he didn't want that, that he'd have her there for his friends sake so ideally we'd all be there together. I said no. Had it been a one off dinner or something I may have but I'm not willing to be stuck with this woman for 4 days.\n\nThere's some conjecture as to where the miscommunication lies but it transpired that before Sam had even spoken to me that the bf had told Lisa that she could come, leading Sam to force the bf to rescind the invitation. Now bf is upset and threatening to pull out. He even called me to 'straighten it all out' but what actually happened was he ambushed me 'that I need to grow up and not hold on to petty grudges'. The conversation descended quickly with him calling me a bitter child, a manipulative cxxt and destined to die alone. I honestly don't know how it got to that stage, I must've said no more than 10 words the entire call. \n\nI've spoken to some of my friends and whilst they're all disgusted with the things he said some did say that perhaps it was time to bury the hatchet with Lisa. Apparently Lisa has said that I should be over it by now and that I'm being unreasonable because I know that people will generally prioritise my attendance over hers. I know this probably sounds selfish but I don't really think that's my problem.\n\nSo AITA?\n\nETA: I've re-read it and it's not that clear but the bf in question is Lisa's, who is very close with Sam.

Asking you to bury the hatchet without a proper apology from her is ridiculous.\n\nYou were graceful in offering to step back. Sam's bf is incredibly manipulative- he has already decided how its going to be, and is pissed that you will not follow his dictat. I hope this is a one off- for Sam's sake. \n\nNTA.", "What Lisa did was incredibly shitty. You offered to bow out, the birthday boy chose to prioritise you being there over her. And wtf is wrong with her bf? NTA.", "The only people who get to determine when you're \"over something\" is you and yourself. There's certainly instances where it would be reasonable to be \"over something\" within a period of time, however the path to support that isn't confrontation and belittling (or downright insults).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI would say NTA here. You presented the option of backing out yourself. That was rejected. The fault for the 'escalation' lies in the assumption by \"the bf\". Unfortunately he seems to have confused \"straightening it out\" with \"straightening you out\".", "Unless Lisa has sincerely apologized to both you and your ex then you have every reason to continue as you are. Her boyfriend escalated so quickly because he felt entitled to you falling in line, and his ability to emotionally regulate in the face of being told no is 0. He and Lisa deserve each other. NTA.\n\nEdit to add that even if she did apologize you don\u2019t owe her forgiveness. Forgiveness cannot be coerced.", "NTA\n\nKind of tough to bury the hatchet when the offender has never once expressed remorse to you and apologized. So she apparently is still a crappy person and you should keep your distance from her. Avoid the drama (Lisa and Sam's bf) and skip the birthday outing with your regrets.", "NTA, Lisa\u2019s boyfriend is a psycho.", "NTA \u2014 What people do with the information that you don\u2019t want to attend because of Lisa over a longer event is their choice. It\u2019s Sam\u2019s birthday event and bf is complaining about who Sam chooses to invite. That seems off to me that bf cares so much about Lisa being there\u2026\n\nAs for your relationship with Lisa, it could be time but that\u2019s up to you. I don\u2019t know the actual impact  on you of the stories about your ex. I can understand that there\u2019s a potential long term trust issue down the road (don\u2019t want to get too comfortable because she might do something like that again). \n\nI do sincerely hope that she doesn\u2019t do that because she\u2019s clearly relevant enough that you have to worry about it to this day given how close she is within your friend group. Perhaps you could talk to Faye privately about this and get her perspective. Faye is one of the only people who seems to know the full story and could offer you the insight that you want to decide what to do. \n\nWishing you the best of luck!!", "NTA sounds like Lisa and her boyfriend are a great match.  She can't be trusted and doesn't apologise, he invites people to other people's events and calls people nasty names.  The perfect couple, they deserve each other.", "NTA for deciding to hold a boundary with Lisa.  That said, it sounds like your friends are growing weary of navigating this feud and eventually you may find yourself on the wrong side of the social ostracism, so it\u2019s worth considering how important it is to you to continuing holding this line.", "NTA.   \nMaybe you should \"straighten out\" Lisa's boyfriend  & the others with the knowledge that Lisa has never apologized and you get to decide when you are over something, not Lisa. \n\nIf people prioritize your attendance over hers, I think that's a pretty strong statement about how people feel about her.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Okay, what Lisa did years ago wasn't cool, but was it that bad? I honestly don't know the impact this quote had, or what was the circumstances.\n\nBut where I agree is that people should move on.

That makes her actions (and her bf\u2019s subsequent actions) so much worse, esp. with no apology afterwards.", "Even without the funeral story (which is so awful on its own) I'd probably still be reluctant to move past without so much as an apology. I mean, Vardy selling dull stories about Rooney's kitchen refits and flooded basements was still pretty shady.", "The issue isn\u2019t the passage of time. The issue is, has Lisa become more trustworthy?  Since she hasn\u2019t even apologized then the answer is no."]}
