I\u2019m still not sure why, but my brother\u2019s future MIL (60\u2019s?F) has been staying with us for the past few days. I don\u2019t hate her, but she\u2019s not someone I would ever want to spend any time with mainly because she\u2019s overweight and really stinky.\n\nAs I\u2019m walking into the kitchen she looked at me and said \u201cEw that\u2019s disgusting you need to put a shirt on!\u201d\n\nWithout missing a beat I say back \u201cIf you think this is disgusting I hope you never look in a mirror.\u201d\n\nNow my brother, his fianc\u00e9 (21F), and my mom (42F) are all mad at me. My grandma (66F) is on my side, but says I should just bite the bullet and apologize, but my sister (25F) and her boyfriend (28M) think it\u2019s hilarious.

The MIL is the AH here, because she's the one who started with a harsh, judgmental comment.\n\nI never consider someone an AH for responding to an unsolicited AH comment.  Like the one MIL did.\n\nAfter all, it's your house.  Rule 1 of being a good house guest is to be polite to the host.

Do you want her to walk around topless?", "INFO: are you sure what when she said \"that's disgusting\", she was specifically referring to your body (in which case your response would've been tit-for-tat) or could \"that's disgusting\" have just referred to the concept of walking around without a shirt at all, in which case your response was much harsher than hers, and the more even response would've been \"if you don't like how I dress in the house I pay rent in, feel free to leave\""]}
