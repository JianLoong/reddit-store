She started that with - not just the comment- but preceding her comment with a sound showing her disgust.  It wasn\u2019t just rude but mean.  And, you pay rent she doesn\u2019t.  She came into your home and mocked you!  I would tell brother and his wife that the road runs both ways. Until everyone recognizes she dished it out first we are at stalemate.

Is there an end date for her to leave? If not, you may want to remind your brother it is 'your house' and he cannot just invite anyone he wants to stay. Have that conversation now before you end up with another housemate you did not want or invite. The comment she made would imply she is too comfortable in your house and doesn't consider herself a guest.
