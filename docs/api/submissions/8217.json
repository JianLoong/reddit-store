The big one is mine, it's a reconverted living room and it's right at the front of the house (so I get first dibs on being broken into I guess) and it's loud as hell because it's next to the road - when my roommates and I moved in, they didn't want to live on the bottom floor and I wasn't bothered so it worked out!\n\nThe 5th little bedroom has been empty thus far, it's in our contract as a storage room but our landlord offered us reduced rent if we were to have an extra tenant (housing in our area is very scarce) and we, being broke students, were like 'Yeah sure whatever'\n\nSo someone came and looked at the house, the room, and is going to be signing for it - we didn't meet them, but they're planning to move soon-ish afaik. Problem is landlord contacted us today to ask if any of us would be okay to switch rooms because new person is disabled and can't have such a small room. We haven't been given any other details apart from physically disabled, so my roommates upstairs all went 'Well, they might not be able to get up the stairs, so you should be the one to move rooms'\n\nIssue is, I really do not want to move rooms. The spare room is crap (which is why it was deemed the spare room) - I love my room, I've signed onto this house for another year and I signed based on my nice room and being in my nice room. I have a big reptile tank, a dressing table and shit - I've done my best to make a terrible student room into a place that I actually like spending time in, and I'm not prepared to give it up.\n\nWe haven't got back to the landlord with a decision yet, but my roommates are saying that if it were them that needed to give up their room, of course they would (okay but that's very easy to say isn't it??) and that I'm being an ass for not doing it.\n\nI really feel for this new person, especially if they're physically disabled and need the extra space, and especially since housing is so difficult to get right now - but I don't want to lose my nice room.\n\nAITA?

I don\u2019t see why the landlord wouldn\u2019t keep looking for someone to rent the bedroom to so you\u2019d still likely get that discount eventually, especially if it\u2019s hard to rent in your area like you say it is", "NTA. The new tenant saw the extra room and agreed to it; and for all you know, they might even be paying a lower rent than the rest of you. Also, the request was for extra space, not avoiding the stairs, so your flatmates rooms go (that's what the landlord asked, too,  \"if ANY of you\"). You put effort into your room. Your stuff doesn't fit into the other room. So no, you shouldn't need to move out because someone else agreed to move in and THEN tried to trade up. And you don't even know what's going on here, disability can mean lots of different things - even if you felt the right thing to do was move out, you don't have enough data to make this decision yet.", "NO, do not suck it up, keep your room, NTA.  If the landlord wants to be greedy, then they can make the spare room accommodating or build a new wall somewhere else.  It isn't your responsibility.  If the landlord tries to force you to change your room, demand to be released from your lease as you never agreed to that room.", "The agreement was that he could rent out that small room. That was it. So it sounds like he may need to find a different tenant if the space that was available doesn't suit them. This would be like you saying you have a one bedroom apartment for rent and I come see it and tell you well actually I need a two bedroom so let's switch. That isn't how it works.

I am disabled, like I can\u2019t physically walk up stairs 90% of the time, the other 10% it\u2019s hard as hell but I can do it. This is on the landlord if they knew the new renter had a disability-they should have either asked if you\u2019d be willing to switch rooms, rented a different location if it was available, or not rented at all (none of those is discrimination).

You and your roommates agreed to a 5th tenant *who would take the available room.* None of the other rooms are available, and the landlord shouldn't even be asking this. You agreed to extend the lease based on keeping your existing room. If the spare room was too small for the potential new tenant's needs, that should have been the end of it-- you already have a lease and the landlord shouldn't be offering up anyone else's rooms, just saying \"ah, that's too bad\" and looking for another tenant who can take, again, the room that is *available*. This isn't like a group of you were all renting together and one person in the group needs a specific room to be accommodated, either before you've all moved in or because of a change in their circumstances--this is a person who was a prospective tenant for the available bedroom only and unfortunately that room won't work for them. The landlord is overstepping here. \n\nPlus the four of you already there signed a contract where that 5th room was the spare room-- trying to make one of you move in there so he can get more money is absolutely unacceptable.", "Nta and absolutely not. The landlord cant demand you do that. Where I stayed different rooms cost more or less based on the size. So if yoh signed a contract with the large room/cost in mind then this is absolutely a hill to die on. Not right for them to kick you out.

Your roommates don\u2019t give a rats ass about you, they just want reduced rent.", "NAH, except for the landlord.\n\n\nI'm disabled, I don't think you need to give up your contracted space on a whim because someone else may need it.

It's the landlords job to rent rooms out, not the tenants to fill the house for the house owner", "There will be another tenant that wants the storage room at some point. Or, if no one wants the storage room, one of the upstairs girls can move into the storage room and rent out their space. I'm sure someone will be interested in it.

Also, it was only the 3 roommates who collectively decided that the new tenant could not use stairs (wouldn't you think this would have been specifically said as a pretty major issue, if it were the case??), so really, since all of them \"would be willing\", then one of them should simply volunteer. OP wants to stay in their room, and certainly should.
