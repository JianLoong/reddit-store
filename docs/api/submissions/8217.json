The big one is mine, it's a reconverted living room and it's right at the front of the house (so I get first dibs on being broken into I guess) and it's loud as hell because it's next to the road - when my roommates and I moved in, they didn't want to live on the bottom floor and I wasn't bothered so it worked out!\n\nThe 5th little bedroom has been empty thus far, it's in our contract as a storage room but our landlord offered us reduced rent if we were to have an extra tenant (housing in our area is very scarce) and we, being broke students, were like 'Yeah sure whatever'\n\nSo someone came and looked at the house, the room, and is going to be signing for it - we didn't meet them, but they're planning to move soon-ish afaik. Problem is landlord contacted us today to ask if any of us would be okay to switch rooms because new person is disabled and can't have such a small room. We haven't been given any other details apart from physically disabled, so my roommates upstairs all went 'Well, they might not be able to get up the stairs, so you should be the one to move rooms'\n\nIssue is, I really do not want to move rooms. The spare room is crap (which is why it was deemed the spare room) - I love my room, I've signed onto this house for another year and I signed based on my nice room and being in my nice room. I have a big reptile tank, a dressing table and shit - I've done my best to make a terrible student room into a place that I actually like spending time in, and I'm not prepared to give it up.\n\nWe haven't got back to the landlord with a decision yet, but my roommates are saying that if it were them that needed to give up their room, of course they would (okay but that's very easy to say isn't it??) and that I'm being an ass for not doing it.\n\nI really feel for this new person, especially if they're physically disabled and need the extra space, and especially since housing is so difficult to get right now - but I don't want to lose my nice room.\n\nAITA?
