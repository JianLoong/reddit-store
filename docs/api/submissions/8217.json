The big one is mine, it's a reconverted living room and it's right at the front of the house (so I get first dibs on being broken into I guess) and it's loud as hell because it's next to the road - when my roommates and I moved in, they didn't want to live on the bottom floor and I wasn't bothered so it worked out!\n\nThe 5th little bedroom has been empty thus far, it's in our contract as a storage room but our landlord offered us reduced rent if we were to have an extra tenant (housing in our area is very scarce) and we, being broke students, were like 'Yeah sure whatever'\n\nSo someone came and looked at the house, the room, and is going to be signing for it - we didn't meet them, but they're planning to move soon-ish afaik. Problem is landlord contacted us today to ask if any of us would be okay to switch rooms because new person is disabled and can't have such a small room. We haven't been given any other details apart from physically disabled, so my roommates upstairs all went 'Well, they might not be able to get up the stairs, so you should be the one to move rooms'\n\nIssue is, I really do not want to move rooms. The spare room is crap (which is why it was deemed the spare room) - I love my room, I've signed onto this house for another year and I signed based on my nice room and being in my nice room. I have a big reptile tank, a dressing table and shit - I've done my best to make a terrible student room into a place that I actually like spending time in, and I'm not prepared to give it up.\n\nWe haven't got back to the landlord with a decision yet, but my roommates are saying that if it were them that needed to give up their room, of course they would (okay but that's very easy to say isn't it??) and that I'm being an ass for not doing it.\n\nI really feel for this new person, especially if they're physically disabled and need the extra space, and especially since housing is so difficult to get right now - but I don't want to lose my nice room.\n\nAITA? Should I just suck it up for the next year and a bit and switch rooms?", "created_utc": 1674616250, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10koia5/aita_for_not_wanting_to_switch_rooms_with_new/", "score": 53, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

While it stinks for the person who wants to move in, you\u2019re not obligated to give up your space for someone who isn\u2019t on the lease yet. The landlord should have been clear with any prospective tenants about which room was actually available.", "NTA\nIt\u2019s your room and you don\u2019t have to move, if the landlord wants to rent out THAT room then they need to find someone suitable for that living space. Don\u2019t give in!", "NTA - your landlord is trying to squeeze more profit out of the house by renting out a room that isn't really a valid living space. There's no reason why you should have to sacrifice what you have already set up and squeeze into a tiny, unsuitable space. The landlord needs to just confess that he does not have a room suitable to that student's needs. If your roommates are so engaged in the idea, one of them can move downstairs into the tiny room and give you their upper floor room. Otherwise, they should put a sock in it.", "If your roommates truly mean what they say, then one of them can give up their upstairs room, you can take that one and they can move into the spare half-room. Leaving the big downstairs one free for the new disabled roommate and allowing you all to get a discount.\n\nAlternatively, seeing as you would be the only one making the sacrifice, you should get the entire discount on rent. They aren't giving up anything to get it. You'd all split utilities between 5 instead of 4, and that would be the saving they get \n\nIf none of them are willing to go for those ideas, then their words are indeed hollow and they are just looking to benefit from your sacrifice. Tell them to go jump.\n\nNTA", "**NAH**, your landlord can ask, but as long as they take no for an answer they're not an asshole. Nor are you an asshole for not giving up your personal living arrangements for a stranger, and that same stranger is not an asshole for having needs either. But having needs does not entitle them to shuffle your life and living arrangement around either.", "NTA The reason you are renting the storeroom is to get cheaper rent. If you are not willing to change rooms you need to find someone who is willing to take the tiny room. Someone looked at the room available and said they want to rent a room, but not that room. Since that is the only room available to rent, the disabled person should keep looking.\n\nI would not give up a large room for a tiny room. Whoever gets the tiny room should have less of a share of the rent. \n\nYou also should ask the landlord what accomodations the person needs. Don't assume that he needs to be on the first floor. Check to see.", "NTA. Plus if you were to do so, I would expect rent to be reduced. Bigger room? Someone should pay more for that.", "NTA, the person knows the limits of their disability and agreed to take the room anyway. That means they found it acceptable and accessible.  Keep your room, as for the roommates... Tell them to move down to the other room, the new person can have yours,  and you'll move to theirs and watch their response.", "NTA do you think landlord showed them the right room? Yours is taken. They can go somewhere else.", "NTA \n\nI'll probably get a load of crap for this but hear me out, please. \n\nFirst of all, the smaller room was in your contract as a storage room. For the landlord to offer this room for rent in exchange for lower rent for everyone says to me that it's THIS smaller room for rent, not your current room, not your roommates' room. Correct?\n\nFor your landlord to suddenly drop the bomb that the prospective tenant is disabled and would need to rent another room, and not the smaller, storage room, is a breach of contract and not at all cool. Asking you to switch at this stage of the game is ridiculous. Tell him NO.\n\nEDIT: You are correct. The only reason why your roommates are urging you to switch is because they're just interested paying less.", "NTA\nDon't give in. Look for a different roommate.", "INFO the disabled student themself came and looked at the available room and signed the lease?  If that's the case, then you don't need to move, they accepted the available room, as is.  If it's too small for them, they should not have accepted it.\n\nIf the landlord is promising some already occupied space to the new tenant, that is not fair to anyone.\n\nAlso if he's introducing a 5th tenant, I hope your rent dropped by 20%.", "NTA\n\nDon't give up the room so you have to live in a 'storage room'. If the room is not suitable then they'll have to keep looking at other places until they find one that meets their needs. If the landlord or other roommates try to force you just refuse.", "NTA. One of your roommates should take the storage room and you can have their room, since they\u2019re so okay with you giving up your room.", "Sounds like landlord said nothing specific about stairs being a problem. You should go back to your roommates and say \"I talked to landlord, the new tenant is fine with an upstairs bedroom, which of you was cool with switching again\" and watch how quick they change their tune. NTA\n\nYou should all tell the landlord none of you will change rooms so he needs to find someone that will actually take the room he has available, which is the converted storage area. \n\nI wouldn't want this person moving in anyway if this is how things are starting off. Sounds like they are trying to pressure the landlord into getting you guys to switch so they can have a bigger room. Or the landlord is making it up and the tenant is willing to pay more for more space and he wants the cash and will lie to get it.", "Nta\n\nThe spare room is empty, if they want to live there, cool, if not then there isn't an open room.", "NTA\n\nThe landlord is trying to shoehorn another renter into his property, it's not your responsibility to sacrifice for his profit.\n\nAs to your roommates, ask them how much extra they are willing to pay to cover your discounted rent for living in a closet. I bet when the extra renter discount results in them paying more than they do currently, their compassion is going to dry up.", "NTA \n\nIt is your room. New person can take the available room or landlord can find another room.", "Can you give un update when you make a decision?", "NTA. Reasonable.", "NTA.  I think your landlord was out of line for asking you to give up your room.  At the time you agreed to another roommate, that issue wasn't on the table.  Imo you should inform the landlord that you are still willing to accept another roommate but only if that new person is willing/able to accept the spare room.", "NTA. You agreed to your current room. You are not required to give it up. I hope I do not come off as an ass for this, but before you agree to them moving in, make sure it is stated that you are not required to provide assistance to this person. It would suck to have them move in, then surprise to with unreasonable special accommodations you have to do. It not your job to take care of them. I have seen a few posts on this sub about not helping roommates with disabilities who get to demanding and expect the roommates to care for them.", "NTA. The room on offer was shown to the person and they agreed to it.  They don't get to sign to take that room, and then request that you move rooms.  And your roommates are lying their asses off saying they would change rooms, no way would they change rooms they selected to one they didn't want unless it gave them some kind af advantage, they are just trying to make you feel guilty.  The add was for a specific room and that's what the new tenant gets.", "It\u2019s hard to judge without knowing what the new roommate\u2019s disabilities are and what kind of accommodations they\u2019ll need. \n\nI feel like your landlord is the real asshole for renting a storage room as a 5th bedroom. I wonder if the new tenant originally agreed to take this room and then they changed their mind at the last minute or of your landlord made it seem like they could have any room they wanted without speaking to the rest of you in the house first.", "NTA\n\nI wouldn\u2019t assume that the disability means they can\u2019t do the stairs. The landlord didn\u2019t ask for your room, a different one. \n\nDoes the storage room have windows? If not maybe they have some medical documention that they\u2019re claustrophobic , or a mental condition that a windowless room would be detrimental to their health, etc.\n\nThe available room is the storage if the prospective person doesn\u2019t want it, the landlord can get someone else. If your roommates want to accommodate this person, they can offer one of their rooms and wait for the response.", "I'm going to say NAH - yet.\n\nI can understand that you don't want to leave the large room, but you and your roommates need more information about the new person's needs. The person might not have any trouble going up and down the stairs, but needs a bit of space for some medical equipment or another reason.\n\nEven if your large room would work best for the new person, the new person might not want it given how loud it can get.\n\nThe landlord seems to be an information bottleneck here. Perhaps he can arrange a meeting between the new person and you and your roommates (yes, landlord can sit in if he wants). You could say that you want to check if you, roommates, and new person will be compatible, and that you all should know what each other needs and wants out of (possibly) adding this new person to the living situation.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
