Also throwaway account because I don\u2019t want my family to find this post.\n\nMy (M22) oldest sister Emma (F28 & not real name) got married last week to Mike (M31 & also not real name). Mike and I have a great relationship, as he has helped me with my studies since I met him back when I was 18. He is an engineer and I study the same program as he has in the same university. Despite having known him for 3 years I\u2019ve grown to basically consider him as a brother I never had.\n\nGiven my love for Mike I hope this clears out any type of speculation that I did this out of spite of him.\n\nEmma and I have not had a good relationship at any point in our lives. She has tormented me heavily during my early childhood, but the real issue was all her past boyfriends and any type of relationship adjacent to that. She would always sneak boys into the house and would force my other sister Jenna (25F & once again not real name) and I to cover for her.\n\nI should also mention Mike and Emma only entered a relationship a year ago; when I first met Mike he was just a dude who was friendzoned.\n\nFast forward to the actual event being Mike and Emma\u2019s wedding. Jenna and I sit beside a cousin we were both close with in our teenage years and haven\u2019t seen in years. Our cousin kept asking us about some of her ex-boyfriends in a mocking way. This sparked up a huge conversation full of stories Jenna and I had on Emma\u2019s many hookups.\n\nOur cousin tells us to go outside with her as she needs a cigarette, so we continue our conversation there. Unfortunately, Mike also likes to smoke and overheard some of the stories, and we wouldn\u2019t find out until later but Mike\u2019s mother had also overheard Jenna telling the story of Emma\u2019s pregnancy scare when she was 19 and how she told our father that it was Jenna\u2019s pregnancy test in the bathroom bin.\n\nWord spread quickly around Mike\u2019s family, and a lot of his family including some of his siblings and his father have warned Mike to get an annulment. Emma is extremely furious at Jenna and I for slut-shaming, and is telling us that we knew Mike\u2019s family was conservative so we screwed up everything by speaking of it aloud with the family present.\n\nMike is angry at me for not telling him about Emma\u2019s history before. Jenna does not take any of this seriously which is understandable, but I have a close relationship with Mike and I would hate to lose it because of this. I have asked Mike if he wants to annul his marriage and he did not give me an answer. AITA?\n\nEDIT: people have an issue with me using the term friendzone. English is not my native tongue so I misused the term. Sorry for the confusion. Mike and Emma were just friends for a couple of years.", "created_utc": 1677956116, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11i9v11/aita_for_exposing_my_sisters_sexual_history_to/", "score": 1215, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Telling those types of stories at your sisters wedding, whether you meant to be overheard or not (and I am pretty sure you meant to be overhead) is an incredible AH move.

This was not an accident.  This is you attempting (and likely succeeding) to ruin your sisters marriage because of a grudge for having to cover her when she was a bit wild when she was young (and yes, you seem to be shaming her for her actions, but there does not seem to be anything wrong with her actions)\n\nYou have likely ruined her marriage.

It is absolutely disturbing and disgusting for anyone to do that at a wedding no matter whose it is. You are clearly worried that her being married to Mike will take him away from you especially since you would be losing him to someone you already don't like.
