This was such a wake up call for me, I can't believe making more money than my husband has turned me into such a disgusting human being. I know a lot of people won't take this seriously but I do appreciate you all explaining this to me. I will be better for him and our family.**\n\nThrowaway. I(26F) have been married to my husband \"Aaron\"(26m) for 3 years now and we have one son(2m). After having him and being able to return to my job Aaron became a SAHP because I am pretty much the breadwinner of the house. Which was going super well into a few days ago.\n\nAaron told me after work one day that he wanted to start working again so he could provide for the family and start making his own money again because he has been on his savings the past two years. I'm against that idea for a few reasons. Before he stopped, he worked very different shifts than me so he was often not at home when I finished work, and I felt lonely then and now I'm really happy coming home to focus spending time with the family. We had maybe a few precious hours before bed on the weekdays prior. I also think he is providing more than enough at home being a SAHP and if he needs to buy something he can come to me or hell, I can even give him my card, I trust him entirely. I explained all this to him but he didn't seem too happy.\n\nThe other day I noticed he had tabs up of him on Indeed on the computer so I confronted him about it after our talk and it lead to a big argument. He told me he did not need my permission to work and I responded by saying that these decisions require the both of us to be on the same page: I'm not on board with so he shouldn't be doing it! especially behind my back no less. He has been really snotty since and I don't know what to do. I told my friend about this and she called me abusive! I asked her how so because I'm not belittling or hitting him, but she said I was na\u00efve for not realizing what I'm doing. I haven't been able to shake what she said. If I'm in the wrong can someone spell it out?", "created_utc": 1670978946, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zlckci/aita_for_not_wanting_my_husband_to_work/", "score": 160, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He should have always had full access to your bank account since he was a sahp.", "YTA and bordering on abusive. This isn't even about the care of your child, it's about you prioritizing your happiness over his. You're saying it's a decision you both need to make but then make the decision for him. You are trapping him in this situation. Learn to compromise or you might find yourself divorced.", "YTA\n\nIf he wants to stay at home that's one thing but you don't get to make him. Quite frankly you are being abusive and what you said about him living off his savings and having to come to you for money is super disturbing.

I asked her how so because I'm not belittling or hitting him, but she said I was na\u00efve for not realizing what I'm doing. I haven't been able to shake what she said.\n\nAbuse comes in many forms. Just because you aren't hitting him or belittling him doesn't make you not abusive. You're financially abusing him. Why did he need to use his savings if you're the breadwinner? Your income should provide for the entire household. Not just you and the child. \n\nYou're denying him the right to economic freedom because you're afraid you'll be lonely? GTFOH. You really need to pull your head out of your ass because A) he may find someone to keep him from being lonely and B) if he does, there isn't jack squat you can really do about it because you seem to have very little respect for him.", "YTA - you're making him live on his savings, based on what you say in your post you haven't given him a way to access your accounts, he came to you and explained his position and you just shut him down. What you describe seems very close to financial abuse and it's definitely you not listening to your partner.", "I cannot tell if you are doing this on purpose or not, but either way you are a MASSIVE asshole.\n\nThis is dangerously close to, if not already, financial abuse. That, and you are also essentially keeping him hostage in the house. Being on the same page is not the same as \u201cIf I say no, then it means no.\u201d \n\nYou come as as VERY controlling. Let me ask you this, when the situation is flipped and HE says no to something, do you drop it just like how you expect him to? I\u2019m going to assume you don\u2019t or don\u2019t even allow him the opportunity to disagree. Another question, was your husband becoming a SAHP YOUR idea that you manipulated him into doing?

Preventing him from making his own money while refusing to pool finances (lending him your credit card does NOT count) makes him extremely dependent on you, which is probably why your friend called it abusive.

If you want money, just ask me.\" \n\nHow does that feel?", "YTA. \n\nThis is very selfish and controlling. If he wants to work, let the man work!

That\u2019s not an exaggeration, I would be very seriously wondering if my spouse thinks of me as an equal partner or a proverbial punching bag.", "Your money is his money. Why was he using his savings? Why would he have to ask for a card? He should have one to yalls money. What you are doing is financial abuse. You may not be meaning to, but you are.

You want him solely financially dependent on you? When he doesn\u2019t want that? That sounds financially abusive. Stop that.\n\nYou are not the final authority in your marriage.

I'm going to assume y'all have separate accounts based on him spending from his savings and you allowing him to use your card. That means your husband who I'm assuming is doing the vast majority of child care and house work isn't actually being fairly compensated for his work because all of the money is staying in an account he doesn't have access to (I realize this is an assumption so correct me if I'm wrong). And even if the money wasn't part of the issue, being a SAHP that interacts primarily with a child all day long is exhausting.

I(26F) have been married to my husband \"Aaron\"(26m) for 3 years now and we have one son(2m). After having him and being able to return to my job Aaron became a SAHP because I am pretty much the breadwinner of the house. Which was going super well into a few days ago.\n\nAaron told me after work one day that he wanted to start working again so he could provide for the family and start making his own money again because he has been on his savings the past two years. I'm against that idea for a few reasons. Before he stopped, he worked very different shifts than me so he was often not at home when I finished work, and I felt lonely then and now I'm really happy coming home to focus spending time with the family. We had maybe a few precious hours before bed on the weekdays prior. I also think he is providing more than enough at home being a SAHP and if he needs to buy something he can come to me or hell, I can even give him my card, I trust him entirely. I explained all this to him but he didn't seem too happy.\n\nThe other day I noticed he had tabs up of him on Indeed on the computer so I confronted him about it after our talk and it lead to a big argument. He told me he did not need my permission to work and I responded by saying that these decisions require the both of us to be on the same page: I'm not on board with so he shouldn't be doing it! especially behind my back no less. He has been really snotty since and I don't know what to do. I told my friend about this and she called me abusive! I asked her how so because I'm not belittling or hitting him, but she said I was na\u00efve for not realizing what I'm doing. I haven't been able to shake what she said. If I'm in the wrong can someone spell it out?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

There's also no reason that he can't have credit cards in his own name that you both have access to.

For the past 2 years your spouse has been drawing from his savings and now has to ask you for money to make purchases???  No, no, no - this is not how the money works when one parent is a SAHP.\n\nMaybe before baby arrived you maintained separate accounts, shared household expenses, and each covered your own discretionary spending.  But once you as a family agreed that your husband would stop working to care for your child and the family home, then your income became HOUSEHOLD INCOME.  Your spouse should not just live off his savings and your generosity / permission.  \n\nThis is not the 1950s where the wage earner covers the household bills and puts the homemaking spouse on an allowance.  You should decide together how the household income is saved, spent and invested.  You should each have equal funds for discretionary spending.  \n\nAnd no, he does not need your permission to work!  You may object to him resuming outside employment because your career will suffer if you are forced to spend time parenting and managing the household.  However, he is sacrificing a LOT of current and future earnings by being a SAHP.  His childcare and household labor has a LOT of value.  You need to protect his interests and be fair.  If you do not share your income equitably, than he needs to resume working to protect himself.\n\nConsider this:  If your spouse does an excellent job in his SAHP role, then his work directly effects your ability to advance in your career.  You are enjoying a \u201czero drag career\u201d i.e. one that is minimally effected by domestic or parental responsibilities.  Therefore your income is now not just \u201cyours\u201d - it is \u201cours.\u201d \n\nIn case you have not figured it out yet, YTA.", "You say that you need to be on the same page, but then when you aren't, as you disagree on this, it's just her had to do it your way.

If you're the breather, then you can cover childcare while he does. If you can't afford that, that's a different conversation than \"I like having him at home\".

Being a stay-at-home parent isn't for everyone.\n\nNo one in a relationship should be dependent on their partner, especially when not provided access to the funds without permission. That is honestly a dangerous position for anyone to be in.\n\nAnd there is this thing called daycare.", "I don't think there's any reason to assume the husband is ashamed to be supported by a woman. \n\nThe husband is not going to sneak out to a job and leave the kid alone without telling his wife. Obviously if he found an opportunity they would discuss it and make arrangements for child care.", "Wow this is sexist. You just assumed he doesn't want to be financially dependent on a woman instead of, you know, wanting a life outside of the house?", "It sounds like he has to use his savings and doesn\u2019t have access to \u201cher\u201d money (which in this case is their money). That sounds like it is more the issue than her \u201csupporting\u201d him (which if he has to pay bills from his own savings, then she isn\u2019t actually supporting him).", "What a swing and a miss on this one!", "Would you want to ask your wife\u2019s permission to make purchases? Would you like to ask to \u201cborrow\u201d her card like you were a child? This is financial abuse.", "I\u2019ve talked to my husband about him not working because I pay all the major bills anyways, it always included him getting added onto my credit card account so he would have his own card.

Breadwinner but he has to ask her for money and he had been using his own savings for the past two years!!! She can't see his problem or why he wants to go to work???", "It's concerning the money she makes at her job is kept separate from him and he needs permission to access it. That's not how having a stay-at-home parent should work.", "Thankfully, the crucifixion happened anyway!", "She's wants to be the breadwinner, but doesn't want to share the bread with him.", "If it was the other way around, and the woman was the SAHP that wasn't allowed to work because the man didn't agree to it, and she had to get his card to buy anything, the internet would burn tf down.", "Still, missing reasons, why is he using his savings? How much of his savings has he used and have you paid him back yet?", "But he is using his own savings right? Even if it\u2019s for things that he wants like clothes or trips or event tickets.

He had given up his job to give you the opportunity to make money. There should be your money and his money at this point.", "And who gets to decide if something is \"needed\"? Do you run all your purchases by your husband? It doesn't sound like it. It sounds like you are financially abusing your husband, and he is sick of it. \n\nIf you want him to be the stay at home parent, then he should not need to ask you for money. He should either have access to your account, or you need to regularly transfer him money.", "And yet he did. Wonder why. Maybe because you're financially abusing him?", "You will pay for it... you are still missing the point. If he is a SAHP, then all the paychecks belong to both of you.", "Well, get ready to pay for the childcare you\u2019ll need because you wouldn\u2019t compromise.

He should have free and open access to joint funds for household and personal spends.

Either way tho, he should have constant access to the family funds. Not your funds, the *family* funds. How are you trying to be a sole provider, yet not providing family funds? When you are the sole provider, the money isn't yours. It's the family's. And he should have his own damn card.", "If he\u2019s the SAHP, he should be getting spending money from the family budget (your salary, not his prior savings) and have access to the family savings account.", "You said he's been using his savings. He should have access to an account without asking for your permission every time he needs something, either for himself or for the home.

You're right, my bad!", "I think it\u2019s really weird that OP, per her edit, has turned this into \u201cmaking more than my husband turned me into a bad person\u201d. \n\nLike, I think that just means you were already a bad person before and now have a specific avenue with which you can be a bad person?", "Yeah, I don\u2019t get it. Like, \u2018he can come and ask permission to get money if he needs it\u2019.", "I'm not saying OP is NOT abusive - I just don't know enough details to say \"Yes, 100%, you're abusive\".  That's all I meant, bud.", "For real.\n\nJust the fact that he's presumably never made any purchases for the family in these two years, and she never thought that was odd or a problem or that he should have a card like you said.

It\u2019s okay if he burns through all of HIS savings just so you\u2019re not lonely sometimes, then?

You might just want to believe that and change or you'll have an ex and be on the hook for child support and maybe alimony.", "Likely because OP admits he\u2019s been living off *his own* savings since quitting - ie, no shared finances and he clearly doesn\u2019t have access to her funds", "This! No one likes to be financially dependent on someone else. I've been in this position twice in my life and it sucks. The first I did a paid internship before returning home to no job. I was out of work for about six months. I had some savings but my internship didn't pay enough to have major bank. The  second was about five years ago I quit my job to get out of a bad situation. I was mentally and physically drained. Again, I had savings but I was without a full-time job for over a year. I was dependent on my parents during this time. When my savings dwindled in both situations it felt embarrassing to have to ask my parents for \"spending money\". \n\nThe fact that OP can't see this is crap. It doesn't even seem like she gave him a real discussion. Rather than support her husband's desire to return to work and come up with a plan she just told him no. Full stop. YTA OP.", "We don\u2019t even know he\u2019s supported by her. She says she\u2019s the bread winner but he doesn\u2019t have access to her money. He\u2019s running low on his savings, again she\u2019s not paying for him. She doesn\u2019t know what a bread winner is. So he\u2019s an unpaid nanny is what it sounds like.

So yes I wouldn\u2019t mind. \ud83d\ude42", "Either shared bank account or nothing if one is a stay at home, anything else is unacceptable. What if the SAHP doesn't feel comfortable asking for money all the time from the working one? OP really needs to stop and think about how she would feel if she were the one staying home.", "It's also worth noting that they have been together 3 years and have a 2 year old kid.  That means they got pregnant almost immediately, so the SAHP didn't really have much time to consider whether that was the path they wanted to take.  Rather, they likely felt immense pressure to quit their job and stay home because it was what the family needed.  \n\nRushing into having a kid, using that kid as a way to pressure the partner into quitting their job to stay home, and then blocking them when they wish to return to the workforce is straight out of the financial abuse playbook.

This is 100% abusive.", "I wasn't really trying to, I was just correcting them because that detail was wrong.", "I guess if you\u2019ve never been in that situation, it\u2019s hard to imagine. When you have to \u201cask\u201d for money to pay for everything, from groceries to bills to small treats for yourself, it can be dehumanizing. You are made to explain every purchase while asking for the money or card. Try to think of the hundreds of little things you spend money on. It all has to be explained. \u201cWhy did you spend $30 more on gas this week?\u201d \u201cWhy do you need to get coffee with a friend?\u201d \u201cWow, you haven\u2019t been budgeting groceries as carefully lately.\u201d It all chips away at your sanity and sense of self. Meanwhile, they spend whatever they want, whenever they want, because it\u2019s \u201ctheir money.\u201d Maybe this isn\u2019t an abusive situation but having been there before, I can tell you it\u2019s a completely awful place to be. My ex-husband claimed he trusted me completely and wanted me home with the kids, but it certainly didn\u2019t feel that way.", "You can say that because you\u2019re not in the situation. It\u2019s an entirely different thing to have to be financially dependent on someone and go through them/check with them *every* time you need to make a purchase.

Those reasons might not be fair, but they are a reality and it\u2019s so unfair of OP to deny her husband that if he wants to work.", "I mean, even if he hasn\u2019t dipped in for emergencies but just because he saw a pair of Jordans he liked and bought them - it\u2019s not fair for him to be eating into his savings and for OP to be amassing wealth, a retirement account, independent access to healthcare (if they live in the US), and stable employment while preventing her husband from being able to do so when he wants to.", "So you two maintain separate finances?
