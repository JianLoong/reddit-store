I don\u2019t allow smoking in my vehicle either and not long ago I let someone use it for a day and immediately could smell the smoke when they returned it. Infuriating. It stinks, could burn something, etc. It\u2019s YOUR vehicle, don\u2019t allow anyone to ruin it for you.", "NTA.  You mom is and so is your step-dad.  Smoking in someone else's care is ridiculously disrespectful.", "Nta. If it's your car, you make the rules on who drives it. Hide the keys", "NTA. Hide the keys. It's not his car. He has \"his\" own. This is your car and he is utterly disrespectful with it.", "NTA\n\nHide the keys or tell him he can reimburse you for the entire cost of the car and buy something that doesn't reek and will actually have some resale value in the future.", "INFO: How old are you?", "NTA. It\u2019s obnoxious to make a mess in someone else\u2019s car. He needs to have it thoroughly clenched. This is before you get to the part where he drove it without permission.", "NTA. He has a different car to drive, but he is choosing to drive (and dirty) yours instead, likely as a power play. He is the asshole.\n\nLegally, if his name is anywhere on any of the paperwork, hiding the keys could get you into hot water. If not, you should be in the clear.", "NTA.\n\nThat\u2019s not a gift to you any more. I\u2019d tell your mom that you never agreed to be financially responsible for your stepdad\u2019s second car, and give her back the keys and never touch it again (assuming it\u2019s not your name on the title and/or loan).", "NTA hide yo keys, hide your wifi", "NTA. Since the car was offered to you as a gift, no one should be driving it without your consent. Though you don\u2019t *fully* own the car (it was given to you but you\u2019re still expected to pay your mom back), the lease-like situation should still mean it\u2019s yours to drive, not your stepdad\u2019s. From what it sounds like, HE didn\u2019t put any money into getting you the car, so he has zero say here.\n\nAlso, he sounds like a huge slob and kind of a jerk.\n\nIgnore him and talk to your mom without him there.

Hide the keys, or keep them with you. I adore my Jeep. I would be monumentally pissed off if someone did that to mine. The good news is, buy a set of earmuffs, take the top off and drive on the hyway for a few minutes and the smoke smell will be pretty much gone unless it's stuck in the material of the seats. Then some fabreeze should take care of most of that.", "NTA. Take the tags off the car and hide them so he can't drive it. Who knows if he made a copy of the key or not.", "Is the car in your name?

Let your mom take care of the price of the car all on her own.", "The only thing that makes the situation weird is that OP says they can't yet drive the car because it has \"dealer plates.\" Dealer plates are only put on when you test drive a car and are covered under the dealership's insurance. No dealer would ever let you out of the lot with dealer plates on a car you just bought.\n\nMaybe OP means the vehicle has temporary plates or a sales tag. If so, that counts as registration and OP can absolutely drive the car until that expires.\n\nMaybe the law is different wherever OP is.

This is exactly why I don't understand car sharing because people trash other people's cars. He wants to use your car because it's clean and detailed.

You might need to go somewhere you can use an extractor if he dropped ash everywhere. \n\n>I haven\u2019t been able to drive it yet due to the dealer plate that\u2019s still on the back.\n\nSo how is he driving it? Who cares if he calls you names? He didn't pay for the car, your mom did. \n\n>he\u2019s been driving his own Jeep that my mom basically bought for him.\n\nSo he has a car or he doesn't?

Tell them if he wishes to borrow the car it must be with your permission, and if he doesn't follow your rules for the car the next time the answer will be no.
