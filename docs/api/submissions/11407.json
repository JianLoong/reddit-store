I don\u2019t allow smoking in my vehicle either and not long ago I let someone use it for a day and immediately could smell the smoke when they returned it. Infuriating. It stinks, could burn something, etc. It\u2019s YOUR vehicle, don\u2019t allow anyone to ruin it for you.", "NTA.  You mom is and so is your step-dad.  Smoking in someone else's care is ridiculously disrespectful.", "Nta. If it's your car, you make the rules on who drives it. Hide the keys", "NTA. Hide the keys. It's not his car. He has \"his\" own. This is your car and he is utterly disrespectful with it.", "NTA\n\nHide the keys or tell him he can reimburse you for the entire cost of the car and buy something that doesn't reek and will actually have some resale value in the future.", "INFO: How old are you?", "NTA. It\u2019s obnoxious to make a mess in someone else\u2019s car. He needs to have it thoroughly clenched. This is before you get to the part where he drove it without permission.", "NTA. He has a different car to drive, but he is choosing to drive (and dirty) yours instead, likely as a power play. He is the asshole.\n\nLegally, if his name is anywhere on any of the paperwork, hiding the keys could get you into hot water. If not, you should be in the clear.", "NTA.\n\nThat\u2019s not a gift to you any more. I\u2019d tell your mom that you never agreed to be financially responsible for your stepdad\u2019s second car, and give her back the keys and never touch it again (assuming it\u2019s not your name on the title and/or loan).", "NTA hide yo keys, hide your wifi", "NTA. Since the car was offered to you as a gift, no one should be driving it without your consent. Though you don\u2019t *fully* own the car (it was given to you but you\u2019re still expected to pay your mom back), the lease-like situation should still mean it\u2019s yours to drive, not your stepdad\u2019s. From what it sounds like, HE didn\u2019t put any money into getting you the car, so he has zero say here.\n\nAlso, he sounds like a huge slob and kind of a jerk.\n\nIgnore him and talk to your mom without him there. Remind her that this was intended as a birthday/graduation gift and explain how your stepdad regularly using and making a mess of your car makes you really uncomfortable.", "NTA, step-dad sucks, and if your mother doesn't step in do something about thos situation she also sucks.", "NTA keep the keys with you at all times", "Obviously NTA.\n\nThe person who should be fighting this battle is not you, but your mother. Have her tell him that it's completely unacceptable for him to be driving your car. If she won't, tell her you don't want to continue paying for the car, and ask her to refund what you've paid to date, as this is not what you agreed to when she bought the car.", "NTA: although your mom is selling you the car, your step dad doesn\u2019t get unfettered access to use it as his personal smoking room if he has his own car he can drive.", "Gross. You have a deal. Take the keys. NTA", "NTA. Would your stepdad have treated the car he'd paid for the way he had treated your car?", "yeah he sounds like a real creep", "NTA\n\nGet away from this brute asap", "NTA. Hide the keys, or keep them with you. I adore my Jeep. I would be monumentally pissed off if someone did that to mine. The good news is, buy a set of earmuffs, take the top off and drive on the hyway for a few minutes and the smoke smell will be pretty much gone unless it's stuck in the material of the seats. Then some fabreeze should take care of most of that.", "NTA. Take the tags off the car and hide them so he can't drive it. Who knows if he made a copy of the key or not.", "Is the car in your name? If so, you can report it stolen when (was going to say if, but it's definitely going to happen) he takes it without permission. You're most definitely NTA", "Nta. Call the police if he takes your keys without your permission.", "NTA. You agreed to pay thousands of dollars for **your** car not your stepdads ashtray on wheels.", "Cause their rapin' everybody out here", "If he is anything like my dad was, then yes. My dad's sense of smell was completely cooked. My dad was more polite about it when I asked him not to smoke if he borrowed my car, but he smoked in it all the same. And if my childhood vacations are an indication, he cracked the window an inch so there would be \"circulation\". Surely no one would know he'd smoked! (not)\n\nNTA", "NTA", "Since you paid the registration, is it in your name? Take the keys away and keep them on you. Do NOT let him drive it anymore. He wouldn't be on the insurance, so if anything happened to it, and it's in your name, you'd be liable.\n\nNTA", "NTA, it is your car. The loan is from your mother instead of a bank. If/when you are of age, get a loan to pay her back. It will help you establish credit so the interest will be worth it. Do Not let your SF drive YOUR car. If you have to park it elsewhere so be it, but draw a hard line on this.", "NTA. Either the car is yours or it isn't. If it is you get to determine who drives it. If it isn't and you've made any payments on it tell your mother you want the money back. If the car is not yours there's no reason for you to make payments. Let your mom take care of the price of the car all on her own.", "The only thing that makes the situation weird is that OP says they can't yet drive the car because it has \"dealer plates.\" Dealer plates are only put on when you test drive a car and are covered under the dealership's insurance. No dealer would ever let you out of the lot with dealer plates on a car you just bought.\n\nMaybe OP means the vehicle has temporary plates or a sales tag. If so, that counts as registration and OP can absolutely drive the car until that expires.\n\nMaybe the law is different wherever OP is. Whether it is or not, the stepfather obviously shouldn't be driving the car and especially not smoking in it."]}
