You were absolutely right to say no, and by doing so you are actually teaching this child boundaries: she can not and will not always hear the word 'yes,' as she constantly does at home.  Don't be sorry, don't apologise.  The way the child is being brought up and behaving, she is sadly developing a spirit of envy and greed, as demonstrated by the way she glared at you and kept repeating she wished she had squishmellos If you had relented, she would not have appreciated it; in addition, you would have reinforced that bad behaviour, i.e., she can demand whatever she wants, using emotional blackmail, if she doesn't succeed the first time.
