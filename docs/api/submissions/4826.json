You were absolutely right to say no, and by doing so you are actually teaching this child boundaries: she can not and will not always hear the word 'yes,' as she constantly does at home.  Don't be sorry, don't apologise.  The way the child is being brought up and behaving, she is sadly developing a spirit of envy and greed, as demonstrated by the way she glared at you and kept repeating she wished she had squishmellos If you had relented, she would not have appreciated it; in addition, you would have reinforced that bad behaviour, i.e., she can demand whatever she wants, using emotional blackmail, if she doesn't succeed the first time.

But I suppose that\u2019s only if you have any interest whatsoever with being closer to your cousin\u2019s kid, I just think you might end up liking her more than you think and maybe she wouldn\u2019t be bratty to you. Sometimes all kids need is another role model or friend, so she\u2019s not exclusively learning \u201cI\u2019m more important than anyone\u201d attitude from her mom, but \u201cit\u2019s good to share hobbies and enjoy things together\u201d from you instead. Again, not an obligation, you don\u2019t have to feel bad because she cried just because she was told no, I just think it\u2019s something worth looking into.\n\nPS if anyone wants to yell at me I promise I know how much Squishmallows are worth, I have hundreds and collect them too~ As I love them a lot, I also wouldn\u2019t ever give them away because I still love them all. But there are a lot of really, really affordable ones (think like $6) if you\u2019re not looking for something popular like bigfeet or cows.
