Just tell her you'll trade 5  squishmellows for her engagement ring. No? It's too precious hahaha. Maybe they'll stop. Close and lock your bedroom door if they come over again.

No wonder they're both babies.", "NTA \n\nI will end of by saying\n\nIf you spoil your child you will raise your grandchild,  if you raise your child you can spoil your grandchild.  \n\nBased on the ages I will say there must be a significant level of entitling behaviors going on.", "Yikes, NTA.  Who just asks if they can have someone's stuff?   If you want to be nice, maybe buy them one as a Christmas present or something but that's a pretty unreasonable thing for your cousin to ask.", "Wth? NTA if her kids wants some, she can buy them herself", "NTA.\n\nIf the kid wants Squishmallows so bad, her mom can buy them for her. Those are yours, that you spent money on because you wanted them. She has no right to demand you give anything of yours up.\n\nAsk your family if it's cool that you take home something of theirs next time you're over at their house.

Maybe that\u2019s why her daughter is so spoiled; your cousin was a child herself when she had her daughter.", "NTA. They are your possessions. You get to choose what happens to them. That child is already on the road to becoming an insufferable entitled adult, and it will do them good to be told \u201cno\u201d every once in a while. \n\nAnd your cousin is an ass for outsourcing her bullying of you to the family.

Her mother can always buy some for her.", "NTA. I don\u2019t know how your cousin can act like that after having a child when she was a young teenager. Your family should be more focused on why she can\u2019t raise her daughter with better manners and she can\u2019t have everything she wants.", "NTA - What the heck is it with people who think it is totally appropriate to demand others' belongings and getting all bent out of shape when refused?  Tell the family members who think this kid is apparently going to be scarred for life without Squishmellos that they can go buy some for her themselves.  This kid and her entitled mother are old enough to learn that their wants won't hurt them.", "NTA, I have kids and my oldest constantly asks for my star squishmallow, and I tell her no.

I enjoy it and spend my money on them. I shouldn't have to give my stuff away cause a child wants it. Its that parent job to buy it or wait for birthdays or Christmas but leave my stuff alone.", "NTA. And woah! What an entitled little girl. Clearly enabled by your cousin. Asking for one was bad enough. (But hey, maybe you was feeling generous, maybe you said no. Your choice). But 5?! No freaking way!!", "NTA she can go to the store and buy some. People are not entitled to other peoples stuff.", "NTA. If she wants one that badly then her mum and the rest of the family can buy one for her, particularly with Christmas around the corner. Apart from the fact that you are collecting them, they are not free and there is such a thing has respecting other people properties. If she doesn't get a reality check she is just going to grow up really spoiled and a nightmare to manage, but that won't be your problem.", "NTA, and squishmellos are like $5 at many stores so there is absolutely no reason your cousin can\u2019t just go buy her daughter one.", "NTA and those things can be pricey!!", "NTA some of those are really hard to find and to be fair I have the feeling they\u2019re the next beanie babies with how much they have blown up. Maybe instead go to 5 Below or something and pick out of few with your cousin come her birthday or tell her mom she can get some for really cheap there herself.", "Nta your cousin can just go out and buy her all the squishmellos her daughter wants. It's not your responsibility to provide for her child. Christmas is coming I'm sure her mom can buy her 5 squishmellos.", "NTA. Your cousin is TA for bringing up a spoilt entitled brat. The child has no right to turn up at someone's home and expect the people to part with items on which they've spent their money that they've earnt. The mother has no right to expect people to give into her brat's temper tantrums, especially by trying to guilt trip, as she did to you, re you having so many squishmellos and the child nothing.  You were absolutely right to say no, and by doing so you are actually teaching this child boundaries and that she cannot and will not always hear the word 'yes,' as she constantly does at home.  Don't be sorry, don't apologise.  The way the child is being brought up and behaving, she is sadly developing a spirit of envy and greed, as demonstrated by the way she glared at you and kept repeating she wish she had squishmellos. If you had relented, she would not have appreciated it; in addition, you would have reinforced that bad behaviour, e.g. she can demand whatever she wants, using emotional blackmail if she doesn't succeed the first time. The mother is setting her child up for a horrible fall.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
