You were absolutely right to say no, and by doing so you are actually teaching this child boundaries: she can not and will not always hear the word 'yes,' as she constantly does at home.  Don't be sorry, don't apologise.  The way the child is being brought up and behaving, she is sadly developing a spirit of envy and greed, as demonstrated by the way she glared at you and kept repeating she wished she had squishmellos If you had relented, she would not have appreciated it; in addition, you would have reinforced that bad behaviour, i.e., she can demand whatever she wants, using emotional blackmail, if she doesn't succeed the first time.

But I suppose that\u2019s only if you have any interest whatsoever with being closer to your cousin\u2019s kid, I just think you might end up liking her more than you think and maybe she wouldn\u2019t be bratty to you. Sometimes all kids need is another role model or friend, so she\u2019s not exclusively learning \u201cI\u2019m more important than anyone\u201d attitude from her mom, but \u201cit\u2019s good to share hobbies and enjoy things together\u201d from you instead. Again, not an obligation, you don\u2019t have to feel bad because she cried just because she was told no, I just think it\u2019s something worth looking into.\n\nPS if anyone wants to yell at me I promise I know how much Squishmallows are worth, I have hundreds and collect them too~ As I love them a lot, I also wouldn\u2019t ever give them away because I still love them all. But there are a lot of really, really affordable ones (think like $6) if you\u2019re not looking for something popular like bigfeet or cows. So if op wanted to, but of course only if, it wouldn\u2019t be a big cost and you could give them to her as a present without sacrificing anything from your collection.\n\nMy nieces really loved my Squishmallows before and although they took the no much more politely, I could tell it was still sad for them. Got them a few a couple Christmases ago and they\u2019ve been making a flourishing collection since then. They always have to show me their newest or favorite \u201csquishies\u201d when they come to see me, and it gives me a fun thing to enjoy with them. Not everyone\u2019s family can be that way of course, and maybe you\u2019d just get ungratefulness and the same attitude and no reward for the effort, but I do think maybe it would be worth a try \n\nEdit if anyone saw it before I noticed lmao changed it to cousin not sister I\u2019m very tired and forgot the word for cousin", "NTA, and for all the family saying you should have just given her one, tell them they can buy her one if they\u2019re so upset about it", "Are they going to reimburse you the current market value? If not, then they need to shut up", "NTA at all. Typical people not seeing the value in a collection just because it's of toys. You're under no obligation to give your belongings to anyone, and it doesn't matter if you collect gold bars, mcdonalds toys or stamps, it's your collection and literally any collection has the potential to be valued extremely highly after a while.", "This has got to be fake. And it\u2019s Squishmallow.", "god I don't know why this is bothering me but it's 'Squishmallow'", "NTA. I (44f) have a squishmallow called Kenny. No one touches him. I also have some stuffies that were given as gifts, including a care bear (Birthday Bear) and Hedwig.\n\nIf mum wants her daughter to have her own squishmallows, she can buy them for her.", "NTA\n\nYours. You paid for them. Your property. \n\nIf cousin wants her to have one she should pay for it", "You should post this on r/entitledparents \n\nYou are NTA of course", "NTA I always laugh when a post says they get calls about a ridiculous situation from numerous people. If its true, do these people really involve themselves in such situations?", "NTA they are a collectible and no one is entitled to your collection. Some of my squishmallow collection is visible from my front door and at halloween I had a trick or treater ask for one. Her mum was next to her so I waited for her to tell her kid that no all you get trick or treating is the lollies handed out and that you aren\u2019t entitled to other people\u2019s things\u2026 but she stood there looking like she expected me to comply. So I said \u201cno they are mine\u201d and shut the door.", "NTA. Send the Amazon search results to anyone who thinks the 7yo child should \"just be given\" stuffed animals and tell them to go nuts and let you know if they need help filling in their credit card information on the checkout screen.", "I\u2019m sorry\u2026your 21-year-old cousin has a SEVEN-YEAR-OLD?!???", "No- NTA- and from now on- you may want to put them away when they show up- otherwise a few may \u2018disappear\u2019- offer to tell those inquiring relatives where you got them so THEY can purchase them for her if they feel she should be \u2018given\u2019 them.", "NTA\n\nYour cousin's kid sounds like a real brat.", "NTA. The child is this way because your cousin encourages it. Stand firm. That is absolutely ridiculous.", "LOL that's perfect! No you are NTA and good for you for not giving in for the sake of \"family\".", "I love you!", "And in the meantime, have some sugar candies for the road!", "LOVE this - LOVE IT!", ">Loudly, to child, while maintaining unblinking eye contact with cousin:  \n>  \n>\"I'm sure if mommy loved you enough she would buy you ALL the Squishmellos your adorable heart deserves.\"\n\nThis is evil genius!", "Diabolical. I like you.", "Worst part is, the kid probably didn't know what they were before the party, and she'll have moved on to some other toy and completely forgotten about them soon enough. Unless of course, Mum keeps bringing it up...", "I'm in my 30s and I collect squishmallows. There's definitely some expensive ones. Also availability differences means they might sell for \u00a35-15 in store but will sell for double or triple that online, especially if willing to mail between countries.\n\n\nThere's also a horrible scalper culture involved. Some really nasty people who will literally snatch from children.\n\n\nNTA for not giving to the kid though, in general I wouldn't give any of mine away to a child as I got them to collect. I would absolutely reward a polite child with one of their own however, which is not the case with this kid.", "Nah, given his sense of humor, Yahweh wants you in his realm.", "I\u2019ll save you a seat", "OMG, same here. NTA", "I also did the math. JFC, no wonder the child is so immature for her age.", "At the grocery store where I live and the Target near me the Squishmallows are usually 30% off. They are usually usually under $20 when I buy them.", "Yep, my kids LOVE these and 90% came from Costco. The other 10% were gifts, LOL!", "Omg yes, the first thing I did was the math! I had my first kiss when I was 14. I can't imagine first; already having sex at at least 13 and second; having a baby at 14. Jezus some girls don't even have their period yet at that age. I truly wonder what the age of the father of the child is..", "I've known a couple of people who got pregnant at 13.  There was a whole LOT of f'd up about those situations.  Most 13 year olds who get pregnant have a *much* older partner in that endeavor.", "I'll bring beer", "I will never understand why collecting antique dolls (children's toys from generations ago) is an adult thing, but plushies are not. \n\nHow would they feel if you had antique teddy bears?!", "When the first saw 5 below I thought it was an ice cream store. Now that was confusing and very disappointing lol", "The audacity! Poor cat!", "They're really cute! The cat is her favorite, but she'll play with all of them from time to time", ">How would they feel if you had antique teddy bears?!\n\nI did have one actually - it was the source of greatest contention.  It was a gift to me from a friend of my mother's who couldn't have children, an heirloom that she passed to me when I was 3 or 4.  In my mother's eyes, that meant that I had to pass it down immediately.  Never mind that it was heavier than my kid and rock hard (Idk what was up with this thing but it kinda felt like it was taxidermied rather than a plushie).  There were several arguments about it.", "My grandmother had my mom when she was 14, followed by four more in 6 years. Mom's the only one who was over 20 when she had her first (22, me). The cousins (grandchildren) are about half and half, in terms of who was an actual adult and who wasn't. This kind of thing used to be normalized, but I think societal mores are winning out (the three oldest great-grandchildren don't have kids yet, and they're \\~24, 20 and 18.)", "Would be common in the UK. They have a child pregnancy crisis for generations!", "It's not uncommon for kids whos parents had them young to also have kids young."]}
