It was organized by the city I'm in and several blocks were pedestrian-only for the occasion.\n\nWhile I was on my phone someone came to me to ask for a lighter. I hand her mine and we start getting acquainted.\n\nShe's 18F and her friend (39M) joined us a few minutes later. I find it odd she has a friend this age but whatever, I don't know their story. As we keep talking something bothers me with the said friend but I can't put my finger on it. This is when I noticed a black dot on her hand, knowing what this means I'm glad I had a mask covering my whole face because this hid my reaction.\n\nA few minutes later she needs to go to the bathroom and I said \"me too\" on reflex, hoping I could separate her from him. We go to the nearest bar but the bouncer told the said friend he's blacklisted. I ask the bouncer if the 2 of us could still use the bathroom showing our IDs (This was a 18+ bar with unisex bathrooms), which he accepted.\n\nAs we're in line I tell her \"I've noticed the black dot on your hand, are you okay?\", she explained she drew this with eyeliner when she was doing her makeup and that she's fine. But my gut and her body language tells me otherwise.\n\nAs she was in the bathroom, the bouncer came in and asked me where she is and to wait for her outside. I answered \"Sure, she's in there, is there a problem?\" to which he responded \"Yeah, your friend ratted you out, we know you're underage\".\n\nShe exited at that moment. She didn't understand why I was being pushed outside by the bouncer, but the bouncer explained again and pushed both of us outside. She started to confront him but he avoided all responsibility and started blaming the bouncer. We crossed the road as he came back to the bouncer so I quickly told her \"I don't know why you're friends with that guy but he's a walking red flag. I'm telling you, I don't like him\". He overheard the last sentence and asked about it. I decided to be honest and told him \"Yeah I don't like you, just because you did something that justified you being blacklisted doesn't mean you had the right to lie on us and get us kicked out! I don't like you, so what?\"\n\nHe got angry and called me a toxic asshole for trying to ruin their friendship. Understanding the situation can get dangerous, I made sure she was living alone and he didn't have a spare key and called her a Uber. I went back home as soon as she took the Uber, letting the guy swear at me as I'm getting away from him.\n\nAITA for telling this guy I don't like him?\n\nEDIT: I kept contact with this girl and we promised each other we would talk and see eachother again.

He lied to the bouncer to try and get rid of you and you absolutely did the right thing to stick by that girl and get her away from him. Dude is a walking red flag, so glad you both made it home safe.", "YTA for being 20 and going to the city run celebration instead of some underground party. And also for trying to sneak into a bar. Just drink or do whatever you do with your people? And go to bars when you're 21. And stop with your friend? It's obvious how that's going to break. The friend is a jerk. You&re AOK. I hope that makes you happy. But do something cooler very soon. I'm sure I'll get downloaded for this. But I'm really sick of the virtue signaling on this sub.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

If you don\u2019t like the guy, you don\u2019t like the guy. No explanation needed. Sometimes you just have to trust your gut. He inquired. Don\u2019t hold back.", "Major yikes at a 39 year old dude being friends with an 18 year old, and it sounds like he let the bouncer know you're underage at the bar (I'm guessing you're in the states?) because he didn't like how quickly this girl and you started talking. Whatever he was doing at a bar with an 18 year old, he knew you were going to stop it and he tried to get rid of you. He didn' t count on you bringing the girl out with you as you were getting kicked out. \n\nYou looked out for her and saved her from having a horrific night out. NTA", "Have you read the story properly? This was a 18+ bar. I'm in Canada not the States.", "Pretty much a SOS, it's to indicate people that you're being abused and you need help", "NTA OP and bravo you saying something and doing something. I bet that 39-year-old is a creep up to no good with an 18-year-old\n\nOP you are not a toxic AH that older guy is the real toxic AH. Good on you saving her and sparing her from whatever horror awaits her. Thanks to you, she has gained a friend like you", "So why did the bouncer kick you out? Because someone accused you? That's not how that works, bouncers check your IDs and confirm ages. The Black dot might have been a coincidence, but this is a common act of over-protectiveness. The man is likely a creep, but you keep your friend in a cage.  \n\n\nESH except your friend who just wanted to enjoy a night with two of her friends. I hope she managed to get some sort of excitement than have to people who jealously covet her fight and ruin a good night.", "You did a very good thing. I wish the bouncer could have been made aware of the black dot. But, he was having a busy night so I won't judge him", "The bouncer kicked us out because the guy who was blacklisted accused us of using fake IDs to get in the bar. \n\nAnd for clarification, I met these two people tonight. This was my first impression on the two of them. When she got home she texted me to thank me for calling her a Uber.", "I'm in Canada, which is why I understood immediately he lied on us. This bar was 18+, meaning the girl couldn't get alcohol (The legal drinking age is 19) but still could get sodas or fruit juices. So he must've said we were 16 or 17, knowing that they couldn't see my face to verify my ID he knew that we had a 100% chance of getting kicked out.", "Don't feed them", "Whatevs. I'm sure I could go back and do a deep dive and close read. But you're obviously just looking for someone to dump on the obvious jerk here and pump you up. So consider yourself vindicated. I'm in a pissy mood. Just forgive me and keep it movin. Have a great night. Or day.", "That's very odd. The bouncer did not Blacklight check your ID? I live in a 18+ legal drinking age province and every bouncers box has a blacklight to confirm if an ID is real.  \n\n\nI'm not saying your lying, I'm saying that either the bouncer is not doing his job or there's something missing in this story left out that would actually get you kicked out.  \n\n\nI also hope you're safe since if these two friends were just strangers to you until tonight, one of which seems to be a creepy older guy hanging out with someone half his age, I'd recommend you doing a background check.", "Wow. What a great reaction, dumping your emotions at me when I'm genuinely wondering if I did something wrong.\n\nYeah you're blocked. I hate people always assuming things. Don't worry, you'll be soon forgotten.", "NTA\n\nYou are a good person who used his best judgement in the situation provided. I do t think the dot was an accident", "AH for using this forum for a pat on the back. You\u2019re a hero and you know it, don\u2019t go seeking props.", "Are you having a stroke?", "For me I guess it was less obvious to know if my ID is real or not, since I'm French I'm using my French passport and not an ID provided by the Canadian government. He probably didn't know all the features of a real French passport and just assumed the guy was telling the truth. I'm assuming the guy blamed me and the bouncer decided to kick her out for being an accomplice.\n\nI posted this when I was already home, and they don't know my address... The only thing they know is that I live in a college residence. They also don't know the residence has security staff 24/7"]}
