The weddings were not planned to be so close, it just kind of worked out that way. I got engaged first but her husband is in the military so they had to rush things a little bit and either get married on 5 months notice or wait a lot longer. \n\nMy family grew up what would be considered lower middle class. My parents are gifting Ash $1,000 to help with wedding planning, obviously this doesn't go that far. We have a decent size extended family and lots of friends. Ash is doing everything she can to be thrifty and will end up having around 70 adult guests at her wedding. She wishes it could be more and with kids, but due to budget cuts had to be made. My fiancee Julie is from a very well off family and with her being their only daughter they are being extremely generous with the wedding budget. I don't want to say how much they've given us but it's more than most households make in a year. It still feels a little surreal marrying into a family like this but I will say they've been nothing but kind to me and Ive never felt judged by them.\n\nWe will be inviting the entire extended family - kids included, and lots of friends as well. We've invited about 250 people and are expecting around 150-200. Ash knew my wedding would have more people but I don't think she realized until this weekend how nice it will be. We saw each other this weekend and while wedding planning came up it was pretty clear how fancy ours is going to be. The food served will be over $150/plate, it's one of the most expensive venues in the area, and the musical performer is relatively well known (family friend of Julies).  Ash asked me if I could \"tone it down\" so it's not so much bigger and better than hers and so people don't compare or skip hers for mine. I told her that her wedding will be amazing and not to compare but I won't be telling Julie to not have her wedding how she wants it. Personally I'd elope or have a giant wedding, it makes no difference to me but Julie wants an extravagant affair and if her parents don't mind paying, Im fine with it too. Ash says I'm being an AH for not even considering otherwise and my mom insinuated that she agreed.

Your fiancee is a part of this event (a crucial part, obv.) and gets a say on how your wedding is planned, which has nothing whatsoever to do with your sister, not to mention that a good chunk of the extravagance is due to her side of the family paying for it. Regardless of how Ash feels, that's not something she gets a say in and it would be a hard hill to climb to try and tone down your wedding for her sake, even if you wanted to.\n\nFrom someone who had a relatively bare bones wedding about a month away from a friend's very posh wedding (with a fair amount of friend crossover), I can say that both events were well enjoyed and it's the attitude and tone of the event that people remember fondly. Hard to hear when you're pinching pennies and trimming a guest list, but it's true in the long run and hopefully something Ash will realize.", "NTA \n\nYour future in-laws are paying for your wedding. I'm sure if the wedding cost were up to you and / or your parents, you'd not have such an extravagant wedding. \n\nYour sister needs to grow up and realize that the world does not revolve around her. Same with your mother.", "NTA. I was in Ash's shoes. Military weddings tend to be cheap. I had a month to plan mine. I would never have asked either of my sisters to change their weddings to match mine. I wouldn't want to do that to them. Julie deserves the wedding of her dreams, and if her parents are willing to splurge, they have every right to do so.", "NTA We all have to live within our budgets. You are lucky to have a large budget and many do not including your sister. It's not the money which makes a wedding anyway. The most fun wedding I ever attended was not a huge budget affair. So long as you don't lord it over your sister, which you are not, then her request is not reasonable.", "NTA - But if you do have extended family who skip hers to attend yours because yours will be \"nicer\" then they are definitely the AH. I hope your extended family know that if they made the cut for your sister that it is an indication of how much she values that relationship given her limited resources.", "NTA. Don't adjust your wedding to accomodate your sister's insecurities.", "NTA\n\nPart of being an adult with siblings is realizing your lives won't necessarily be economically equal due to things like luck, decisions, hard work, and who/if you marry. Is she going to ask you to not buy a house if she and her husband can't?", "NTA. I mean your sister is correct that some people will compare (hopefully not out loud!). It's just human nature since the weddings are close. However, her request for you to change your wedding plans is unreasonable. If the situation were reversed, would she \"tone\" down her wedding to make it more in line with yours? I think not.", "NTA- It's your wedding, the day should be as close to perfect for you and your partner.", "NTA. That makes no more sense than you telling her to \"tone it up\".", "NTA. She\u2019s asking you to tone down your fiance\u2019s wedding. That\u2019s crazy, but I\u2019m glad you told her that you weren\u2019t gonna do that. That\u2019s so unfair of her\u2026", "NTA. Your sisters wedding and what she can afford has nothing to do with your fianc\u00e9 and your wedding. It\u2019s pretty weird to even care about it honestly. Ash just seems jealous.", ">Ash asked me if I could \"tone it down\" so it's not so much bigger and better than hers\n\nThe first word that came to mind after reading this was \"selfish\". You, Julie, and her family are all supposed to alter the plans for your wedding just to make Ash feel better about her own wedding? Hell no. \n\nNTA", "NTA.  Although you are siblings your weddings are completely separate events.  There will probably be comparisons made but just because one wedding is extravagant it doesn't mean the other one won't be special in its own way.  \n\nLots of people think big weddings are a waste of money so your family isn't necessarily going to think that Ash's wedding is inferior.  They don't have to be the same.", "This is really strange.  Most people on the planet are in a position where some can afford more than they, and some can do less.  Pretty much a fact of adult life.  Sis needs to (grow up a little) relax and celebrate both events.  NTA", "NTA.\n\nSince hers will be first, no one is going to be comparing the two at her wedding.  I very much doubt anyone will skip hers to be at yours, but if they do, then they will be able to save even more.\n\nYou're spending $30K on food alone.  There's no way to meaningfully tone down that type of wedding to make it more comparable to hers.  The most you can do is not to mention the entertainer or the details of the menu in the invitations.\n\nYou are right to refuse to talk to Julie or her parents about it.  Because if you do, and they refuse (or even if they tone it down but not \"enough\")  then THEY are the AHs instead of you.", "NTA. Your sister will have a lovely ceremony and reception, and it will mean everything to her because she's done what she wants with what she has, including the limited budget. Your wife-to-be will feel the same. \n\nComparison isn't appropriate: the needs and circumstances are different. Either way, it's not your responsibility to change the situation.", "NTA.  You and your fianc\u00e9 can be as extravagant as YOU feel comfortable being with your wedding. Have fun at both celebrations ,", "Absolutely not.", "NTA, at some point people will learn that the whole world can't accomodate them... Not today though. You are right, your fiancee wants a grand wedding and had means to pay for it, without asking your family to contribute. So your family or anyone else for that matter, have no say here. As long as you and her are happy with the arrangement and have means to pay, you are fine.", "NTA. Yes, life isn't fair, and some people have more money than others. That means that some people will have more luxurious experiences, and bigger weddings, than others. But such is the way, you are not doing it to \"outshine\" Ash or humiliate her with your display of wealth, it's just what it is.", "Tough situation, but NTA.", "NTA. \nYou have a right to have your day be how you envision it. I'm sorry your sister us insecure, but that's on her.", "NTA. If she didn\u2019t want the weddings close together, she and her fianc\u00e9 could have waited. They chose to have a date close to yours. \n\nJust because your sister is feeling insecure doesn\u2019t mean you and your partner don\u2019t get the wedding you want and can afford.", "NTA. The whole day is just a celebration of the couple after all, getting caught up on the finery and jealousy takes away from the fact that it's about celebrating their love and starting a life together.", "I can totally get why she's feeling that way and honestly think fairly poorly of weddings so outrageous but it's your wedding do as you want. I feel badly for your sister though because yeah hers will likely be skipped and definitely overshadowed regardless if that's right or not. Even though I don't like weddings like yours NTA because it's your wedding and not doing anything wrong. Nothing wrong with her asking but calling you an AH isn't okay either.", "NTA. You'll (hopefully) only get married once. (Congratulations btw!) It's the one day in your and your fiancee's lives that will be all about the two of you. You don't have to \"tone it down\" to soothe your sister's ego.\n\n>My parents are gifting Ash $1,000 to help with wedding planning, obviously this doesn't go that far.\n\nNonsense. That much money will pay for a marriage license, a nice meal afterward, and then some.\n\n>Ash is doing everything she can to be thrifty \n\n>and will end up having around 70 adult guests at her wedding. She wishes it could be more and with kids\n\n70 guests is not thrifty. Your sister, her betrothed, and the minimum number of witnesses required would be thrifty.", "NTA. It's Julie's wedding, you don't have the option to tone it down.", "NTA -\n\nHowever, this may cause a life-long rift between you and your sister, especially if she believes (rightly or wrongly) that people skipped her wedding to attend yours. \n\nThe timing is lousy, and that is no one's fault really.  Two weddings a month apart is - for out-of-town guests -  two sets of hotels, eating out,  travel expenses,  taking time off from work, and so on.   So your sister is right to feel that people may skip out on her more modest wedding to get the \"experience\" that your upscale event will give them. \n\nYou don't have to change your plans for her.  But please don't be angry at your sister even if she gets angry at you.", "NTA poor people issues", "INFO\n\nWho's wedding was planned and on the books first?", "You and your spouse are free to do what you want regardless, but it\u2019s an incredibly frivolous thing to do. Sparing no expense and going all out on a wedding inviting 300+ people, more than half of which you\u2019ll probably never talk to again just seems very out of touch in this day and age. Just because you can afford the Charles and Diana wedding doesn\u2019t mean you should have one that lavish. Especially when, no offense, most who do haven\u2019t done nearly anything in life to deserve or warrant being celebrated so feverishly. \n\nIt would be much wiser to have a modest wedding and take the money you would have spent and invest it into your actual future.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It\u2019s not fair that your sister can\u2019t have an expensive wedding, but part of life is that we are sometimes expected to be happy for people when they have things that we don\u2019t! Your sister should focus on what the day\u2019s about: that husband-to-be of hers! After all, how many lonely gals out there would be able to ask OP\u2019s sister to tone it down with her partner when there are lonely and single people out there!!

It just have to taste really good.\n\nThe cake also should be a good one.

There\u2019s no wrongdoing on OPs part.", "Come on, now. Thrifty doesn't mean \"absolute bare minimum.\" It means spending within your means to get as much as you can for your dollars. 1000 dollars for 70 guests at a wedding is VERY thrifty.", "Since Ash's military wedding is a rush job, we can safely assume the fancy wedding was planned first.", "It\u2019s their wedding, they can do whatever they want. It\u2019s not their responsibility to tone down their lifestyle just so other people don\u2019t feel some kind of way about it.", "I hear you but her parents didn't offer us a large amount for an investment account.

It\u2019s not his place to demand that they use the money for something else. \n\nHe didn\u2019t ask if it was financially wise to spend a lot on a wedding, he asked if he was an AH for not changing his wedding plans to meet his sister\u2019s demands. You think it\u2019s frivolous, the people who run the small businesses that make up the majority of the wedding industry would probably disagree.", "Well that *was* the first thing I said lol. And I didn\u2019t mention Toning it down for the sibling at all. I simply made my case that big weddings in general that you otherwise couldn\u2019t afford are frivolous. Thought it was pretty clear lol", "You and your fianc\u00e9e are free to have whatever kind of wedding you would like. It\u2019s not your fault if others feel insecure or upset by how much money your fianc\u00e9e\u2019s parents decide to spend on their only daughter\u2019s wedding. \nThe entitlement of other people is astounding.", "I get why your sister is feeling insecure, but if it makes your sister feel any better, I had the high society wedding that you\u2019re having and my sister had what sounds pretty similar to what your sister is having.

That said, I am sympathetic that likely a lot of family/friends will skip her wedding in favor of yours, and yes, that's going to hurt her. Of course that's not you or your fiance's fault, but I understand why your sister is sad about it. Also people can be pretty ruthless and judgy when it comes to other people's weddings - your events will be compared by those who attend both. Hopefully people are nice enough not to do it in front of you and your sister though (and if they do, I hope you at least stand up for her I guess).\n\nYou're not doing anything wrong, and your sister shouldn't ask you to tone things down. But just have some sympathy for her because some people are probably gonna be dicks about comparing your wedding.", "NTA but be graceful about it. It has to be really hard to be on the cheaper end of this. You are absolutely NTA for having the wedding you want, but keep discussion about prices and details about extravagant plans to yourself. That's just a way to make her feel worse and probably isn't necessary to discuss anyway.", "NTA. Your future wife's family is paying so she can have the wedding of her dreams. It's beyond rude of your sister to ask you to tone it down because she can't afford something similar. If she wants a more lavish wedding she can do a civil ceremony now and save up for a celebration at a later date.", "\"Very well off\" and \"more than most households make in a year\", so really, you mean extremely rich.  150-200 people times $150/plate means the food alone is costing up to $30,000  I'm guessing the wedding will cost at least $100k and probably more.  People are dying because they can't afford housing, food, and medicine, but go ahead and spend all this money on a one-day event so people will be \"impressed.\"", "NTA", "NTA. Just say yes. In situations like this, there is no way to know if you actually toned it down or not. They'll come to the wedding and later on you can always say it was supposed to be even bigger. You upsetting your sister does you no good, even if you are 100% right. Just keep peace.", "NTA. You\u2019re not responsible for your sister\u2019s envy. Weddings are not competitions and it\u2019s rude AF to compare events of two couples in vastly different circumstances. Enjoy your day.", "NTA another post where someone is demanding you tear yourself down to appease them. 'If I cant have it you cant have it either,' attitude. My brother's wedding was far more expensive than mine, but it was very formal and stiff and his wife's family were unfriendly. Mine had less money spent on it, but my husband's lovely family really pulled together for us, cutting flowers in their gardens and decorating the church with beautiful arrangements. It had a totally different feel. My daughter had a very relaxed ceremony on the beach just with immediate family. Sometimes simple, friendly events can end up being the weddings people really remember.", "NTA - BUT you and your fiancee are now obligated to get your sister a really nice wedding gift.", "NTA you do that now, your family will continuously asking you to tone down your lifestyle or show up with their hands out. \n\nIt will be constantly asking your wife to tone down bridal shower, baby shower and all future milestones.

Not to say yours will end that way, but statistically she's got a leg up.", "NAH\n\nYour sister gets $1,000, while your fiancee gets someone's yearly annual salary. Some envy is going to happen and is very natural. Your sister has had one conversation, with you, not your fiancee, and a primary focus was her wish that people not skip her wedding because yours will be more of an event, so she's worried if they can only pick one, they'd pick yours.\n\nShe hasn't asked you for money, or for your stuff, and hasn't been nasty or sabotaging. \n\nI think she likely knows that you have very little control over what your bride's family is providing. She's honestly acted very well, though she's revealed she is human and is feeling inconvenient human things.\n\nKeep in mind that she is not actually upset over comparing *weddings or things*. She is upset over comparing the *perceived inherent value* of herself, vs. your bride. \n\nMeaning, people will be tallying up all the stuff your bride brings to the table (the money, the connections, the family, the class, the taste, the upper middle class culture, all of it) and all the stuff your sister brings to the table (thrifty lower middle class poor, with too many family members), and they will judge your sister as intrinsically worth less as a person than your bride. She is less desirable and less valuable than your bride to the point where, if this were the Titanic, your bride would probably be hand escorted to a life boat, while your sister left to drown. \n\n*That's* why she's upset and feeling low, because no one likes having to think about such things, which are generally best left in a box in the back of the closet and never touched. She's not broken up about her catering being cheap, but her being cheap. \n\n(They're likely doing it to you, too, though to a lesser degree because you're a man. You may have noticed that people are saying things like you should be so *grateful* to have been chosen by your bride, and so lucky... but the luck isn't about you being lucky enough to have the love of your life, but more about how lucky it is that she's got buckets of money and can carry you up the ladder and better options galore, and yet somehow, she picked you)\n\nI think your sister is mainly asking for some sensitivity and for you to help refocus some attention on her until her wedding happens, after which you can have it back. I think that's very fair. No bride ever expects to be overshadowed by her *brother* on her wedding day.\n\nShow your sister consideration by helping her out with her wedding stuff, as you are able and have time (such as making centerpieces, volunteering to set up or tear down, seeing if you have any buddies who can do things as favors, etc.) If your own bride can enthusiastically (and non judgementally) help too, even better.\n\nYou can also help by keeping comparisons to your own wedding to a minimum until after hers is over, after which you can enjoy the full attention.\n\n For example, if you're all sitting around, helping your sister come up with a playlist for her wedding, and someone starts asking you what you'll be doing at yours: that is not the time to go on and on about the famous performer you were able to get for yours. That's when you give a vague answer and turn the conversation back to your sister's wedding. You can gush about your wedding singer later, when it isn't supposed to be about her.\n\nDon't be pitying or condescending about it, just be really happy for her and absolutely positive her wedding is going to be amazing.\n\nOn a different note: considering you're marrying well above your class, I would definitely recommend you preemptively go find some books on cross-class relationships. It tends to cause more communication problems than you think.", "NTA  not everyone likes a big extravaganza. tell your sister that people will be focusing on her & groom. her wedding will be more intimate, more romantic. whenever I hear people talk about weddings they've gone to, it's never a party review. they talk about the ceremony, the bride & groom and who got the most drunk.", "NTA I paid for the really expensive wedding my sister in law had a bbq wedding at the family farm. I should have done the same. \n\nNo one of any consequence or value compares weddings. \n\nJust be there for your sister, and if you can spare some funds take her to the florist and pay for the floral arrangements as part of your wedding gift.

It\u2019s obviously not required but I\u2019m sure she would appreciate the gesture. Speaking as the little sister who ended up with a way shittier socioeconomic background due to circumstances beyond my control; it sucks. Both my sisters had wedding dresses that costed more than my entire wedding party will cost and I know that alone made me extremely insecure. Constantly being compared, knowing everyone will be talking about your wedding, how most of the people will probably skip hers to go to yours (due to it being close I know some family members will do that instead of making double trips). You are not at fault, nor are you or your future wife AHs, but I don\u2019t really think your sister is either. \n\nFood for thought I guess? Either way, I wish you and your future MRS a happy wedding day!!", "NAH", "I also feel that with Ash's being first, there can't possibly be an expectation that Ash's will be as extravagant as OP's.", "Are the people who are invited to both weddings local?

If many have to travel I think you are being a tad optimistic in how many people will be attending both weddings from your family.\n\nA bit of hope for your sister\u2026thanks to Covid we had 2 weddings. The first was small and intimate (30 people), the second was big and fancy. I would have the first wedding over again in a second. It was with all the people we loved the most, it had amazing food that everyone is still talking about almost 2 years later, and we had the best time. We had to pull it all together really quickly and we thankfully had amazing family and vendors that helped us pull it all together for very little $$$. Our second wedding was very expensive and like your fianc\u00e9 my parents paid for it, and was beautiful, memorable, and fun but not nearly as special.\n\nAlso, she will have a lot more time to enjoy her day instead of making the rounds for 250ish guests. \n\nYou are obviously NTA, and I doubt your sister is an AH either. She just wants people to enjoy her day and want to be there for it. The best thing you can do for her is to be excited for her day.

Even a wedding not on a shoestring budget would\u2019ve paled in comparison. OP\u2019s sister just has to work through her feelings and make her own wedding as memorable as she can.

I understand why your sister likely feels insecure, but it sounds like you're not doing this just to upstage her, so it is what it is.\n\nThat said, you're likely to have many similar situations going forward if the disparity in family wealth is as big as you suggest, so it's probably good practice to get used to it now.", "NTA. \n\nYour sister CHOSE to have her wedding date so close to yours knowing your fianc\u00e9e comes from a family with money!\n\nYour sister needs to come to grips with this now or she is going to be competing with your wife forever. \n\nShe needs to become secure in the things she has and enjoy them for what she wants and not compare. \n\nShe best learn this now or she is going to have a problem with your kids, schools, house etc \u2026", "Also, OP got engaged first. If the sister was concerned about being overshadowed, she could have chosen to have a long engagement. Instead, she made a conscious decision to have the weddings close together.

In total there was close to 30ish people give or take and honestly the only thing I\u2019d change is giving family members more time to plan to come out as I had a week to plan it, you don\u2019t have to compromise with your sister about how your wedding should be because it\u2019s YOUR DAY not hers.

It was funny how similar so many of the weddings really were to each other, lol!", "NTA. You say the weddings were not \"planned\" to be so close, but it remains a fact that your wedding was planned first. Your sister *chose -* for whatever reason - to have her wedding a month before you. Having two weddings so close together always runs the risk of guests only attending one, and it was pretty selfish of her to put *you* at risk for guests skipping the wedding. \n\nBut now that she *realizes* that guests are more likely to skip her wedding rather than yours, she decides to blame it on your \"lavishness\". \n\nAsh is a giant hypocrite:\n\n1. There was always a chance that people would skip one of the weddings. She caused this risk and was happy to accept this risk when she thought the risk would be equally shared between the two of you. (Or maybe she thought you would bear the biggest burden of it? Maybe she thought people would go to her wedding because it was first?)\n2. You did not do anything to increase the chance that people would skip one of the weddings. That chance is entirely on her, for planning her wedding so close to yours. \n3. People are more likely to skip her wedding because it was announced after yours.\n4. People are more likely to skip a child free wedding, regardless of whether there is another wedding close to it. Tough luck. Don't organize a child free wedding if you can't take \"no\" for an answer.  \n5. People have no idea how \"lavish\" your wedding is going to be from the invitation. That is not going to factor into their decision making at all.  \n6. Let's be clear what she is asking of you: she is asking you to *uninvite* people from your wedding. That can have lifetime repercussions for your relationship with these people. She wants you to torpedo relationships for her *ego*. \n\nBasically, she caused a problem, was completely when she (unjustifiable) thought she was inflicting this problem on you, but now that she is starting to realize that she is inflicting the problem more on herself than on you, she is grasping at straws to blame you for it.\n\nPersonally, I'd stop trying to reassure her narcissistic ego that her wedding will be amazing. That is just sending the message that you are somehow responsible for her emotions, and is just enabling and encouraging the crazy impudent boundary stomping.

All in all it cost probably $5k and was nothing fancy at all but it was fun and the best wedding my family had been to (and my mom's on her 5th so that's kinda saying something) all in all it really doesn't matter about decor or the venue, if you've got good food, good music, and fun people that's all that matters really", "The first word that came to mind after reading this was \"selfish\".
