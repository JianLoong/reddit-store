The weddings were not planned to be so close, it just kind of worked out that way. I got engaged first but her husband is in the military so they had to rush things a little bit and either get married on 5 months notice or wait a lot longer. \n\nMy family grew up what would be considered lower middle class. My parents are gifting Ash $1,000 to help with wedding planning, obviously this doesn't go that far. We have a decent size extended family and lots of friends. Ash is doing everything she can to be thrifty and will end up having around 70 adult guests at her wedding. She wishes it could be more and with kids, but due to budget cuts had to be made. My fiancee Julie is from a very well off family and with her being their only daughter they are being extremely generous with the wedding budget. I don't want to say how much they've given us but it's more than most households make in a year. It still feels a little surreal marrying into a family like this but I will say they've been nothing but kind to me and Ive never felt judged by them.\n\nWe will be inviting the entire extended family - kids included, and lots of friends as well. We've invited about 250 people and are expecting around 150-200. Ash knew my wedding would have more people but I don't think she realized until this weekend how nice it will be. We saw each other this weekend and while wedding planning came up it was pretty clear how fancy ours is going to be. The food served will be over $150/plate, it's one of the most expensive venues in the area, and the musical performer is relatively well known (family friend of Julies).  Ash asked me if I could \"tone it down\" so it's not so much bigger and better than hers and so people don't compare or skip hers for mine. I told her that her wedding will be amazing and not to compare but I won't be telling Julie to not have her wedding how she wants it. Personally I'd elope or have a giant wedding, it makes no difference to me but Julie wants an extravagant affair and if her parents don't mind paying, Im fine with it too. Ash says I'm being an AH for not even considering otherwise and my mom insinuated that she agreed.

Your fiancee is a part of this event (a crucial part, obv.) and gets a say on how your wedding is planned, which has nothing whatsoever to do with your sister, not to mention that a good chunk of the extravagance is due to her side of the family paying for it. Regardless of how Ash feels, that's not something she gets a say in and it would be a hard hill to climb to try and tone down your wedding for her sake, even if you wanted to.\n\nFrom someone who had a relatively bare bones wedding about a month away from a friend's very posh wedding (with a fair amount of friend crossover), I can say that both events were well enjoyed and it's the attitude and tone of the event that people remember fondly. Hard to hear when you're pinching pennies and trimming a guest list, but it's true in the long run and hopefully something Ash will realize.", "NTA \n\nYour future in-laws are paying for your wedding. I'm sure if the wedding cost were up to you and / or your parents, you'd not have such an extravagant wedding. \n\nYour sister needs to grow up and realize that the world does not revolve around her. Same with your mother.", "NTA. I was in Ash's shoes. Military weddings tend to be cheap. I had a month to plan mine. I would never have asked either of my sisters to change their weddings to match mine. I wouldn't want to do that to them. Julie deserves the wedding of her dreams, and if her parents are willing to splurge, they have every right to do so.", "NTA We all have to live within our budgets. You are lucky to have a large budget and many do not including your sister. It's not the money which makes a wedding anyway. The most fun wedding I ever attended was not a huge budget affair. So long as you don't lord it over your sister, which you are not, then her request is not reasonable.", "NTA - But if you do have extended family who skip hers to attend yours because yours will be \"nicer\" then they are definitely the AH. I hope your extended family know that if they made the cut for your sister that it is an indication of how much she values that relationship given her limited resources.", "NTA. Don't adjust your wedding to accomodate your sister's insecurities.", "NTA\n\nPart of being an adult with siblings is realizing your lives won't necessarily be economically equal due to things like luck, decisions, hard work, and who/if you marry. Is she going to ask you to not buy a house if she and her husband can't?", "NTA. I mean your sister is correct that some people will compare (hopefully not out loud!). It's just human nature since the weddings are close. However, her request for you to change your wedding plans is unreasonable. If the situation were reversed, would she \"tone\" down her wedding to make it more in line with yours? I think not.", "NTA- It's your wedding, the day should be as close to perfect for you and your partner.", "NTA. That makes no more sense than you telling her to \"tone it up\".", "NTA. She\u2019s asking you to tone down your fiance\u2019s wedding. That\u2019s crazy, but I\u2019m glad you told her that you weren\u2019t gonna do that. That\u2019s so unfair of her\u2026", "NTA. Your sisters wedding and what she can afford has nothing to do with your fianc\u00e9 and your wedding. It\u2019s pretty weird to even care about it honestly. Ash just seems jealous.", ">Ash asked me if I could \"tone it down\" so it's not so much bigger and better than hers\n\nThe first word that came to mind after reading this was \"selfish\". You, Julie, and her family are all supposed to alter the plans for your wedding just to make Ash feel better about her own wedding? Hell no. \n\nNTA", "NTA.  Although you are siblings your weddings are completely separate events.  There will probably be comparisons made but just because one wedding is extravagant it doesn't mean the other one won't be special in its own way.  \n\nLots of people think big weddings are a waste of money so your family isn't necessarily going to think that Ash's wedding is inferior.  They don't have to be the same.", "This is really strange.  Most people on the planet are in a position where some can afford more than they, and some can do less.  Pretty much a fact of adult life.  Sis needs to (grow up a little) relax and celebrate both events.  NTA", "NTA.\n\nSince hers will be first, no one is going to be comparing the two at her wedding.  I very much doubt anyone will skip hers to be at yours, but if they do, then they will be able to save even more.\n\nYou're spending $30K on food alone.  There's no way to meaningfully tone down that type of wedding to make it more comparable to hers.  The most you can do is not to mention the entertainer or the details of the menu in the invitations.\n\nYou are right to refuse to talk to Julie or her parents about it.  Because if you do, and they refuse (or even if they tone it down but not \"enough\")  then THEY are the AHs instead of you.", "NTA. Your sister will have a lovely ceremony and reception, and it will mean everything to her because she's done what she wants with what she has, including the limited budget. Your wife-to-be will feel the same. \n\nComparison isn't appropriate: the needs and circumstances are different. Either way, it's not your responsibility to change the situation.", "NTA.  You and your fianc\u00e9 can be as extravagant as YOU feel comfortable being with your wedding. Have fun at both celebrations ,", "Absolutely not.", "NTA, at some point people will learn that the whole world can't accomodate them... Not today though. You are right, your fiancee wants a grand wedding and had means to pay for it, without asking your family to contribute. So your family or anyone else for that matter, have no say here. As long as you and her are happy with the arrangement and have means to pay, you are fine.", "NTA. Yes, life isn't fair, and some people have more money than others. That means that some people will have more luxurious experiences, and bigger weddings, than others. But such is the way, you are not doing it to \"outshine\" Ash or humiliate her with your display of wealth, it's just what it is.", "Tough situation, but NTA.", "NTA. \nYou have a right to have your day be how you envision it. I'm sorry your sister us insecure, but that's on her.", "NTA. If she didn\u2019t want the weddings close together, she and her fianc\u00e9 could have waited. They chose to have a date close to yours. \n\nJust because your sister is feeling insecure doesn\u2019t mean you and your partner don\u2019t get the wedding you want and can afford.", "NTA. The whole day is just a celebration of the couple after all, getting caught up on the finery and jealousy takes away from the fact that it's about celebrating their love and starting a life together.", "I can totally get why she's feeling that way and honestly think fairly poorly of weddings so outrageous but it's your wedding do as you want. I feel badly for your sister though because yeah hers will likely be skipped and definitely overshadowed regardless if that's right or not. Even though I don't like weddings like yours NTA because it's your wedding and not doing anything wrong. Nothing wrong with her asking but calling you an AH isn't okay either.", "NTA. You'll (hopefully) only get married once. (Congratulations btw!) It's the one day in your and your fiancee's lives that will be all about the two of you. You don't have to \"tone it down\" to soothe your sister's ego.\n\n>My parents are gifting Ash $1,000 to help with wedding planning, obviously this doesn't go that far.\n\nNonsense. That much money will pay for a marriage license, a nice meal afterward, and then some.\n\n>Ash is doing everything she can to be thrifty \n\n>and will end up having around 70 adult guests at her wedding. She wishes it could be more and with kids\n\n70 guests is not thrifty. Your sister, her betrothed, and the minimum number of witnesses required would be thrifty.", "NTA. It's Julie's wedding, you don't have the option to tone it down.", "NTA -\n\nHowever, this may cause a life-long rift between you and your sister, especially if she believes (rightly or wrongly) that people skipped her wedding to attend yours. \n\nThe timing is lousy, and that is no one's fault really.  Two weddings a month apart is - for out-of-town guests -  two sets of hotels, eating out,  travel expenses,  taking time off from work, and so on.   So your sister is right to feel that people may skip out on her more modest wedding to get the \"experience\" that your upscale event will give them. \n\nYou don't have to change your plans for her.  But please don't be angry at your sister even if she gets angry at you.", "NTA poor people issues", "INFO\n\nWho's wedding was planned and on the books first?", "You and your spouse are free to do what you want regardless, but it\u2019s an incredibly frivolous thing to do. Sparing no expense and going all out on a wedding inviting 300+ people, more than half of which you\u2019ll probably never talk to again just seems very out of touch in this day and age. Just because you can afford the Charles and Diana wedding doesn\u2019t mean you should have one that lavish. Especially when, no offense, most who do haven\u2019t done nearly anything in life to deserve or warrant being celebrated so feverishly. \n\nIt would be much wiser to have a modest wedding and take the money you would have spent and invest it into your actual future.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It sucks and I feel for your sister, as I\u2019m sure you do too, but there\u2019s only so much you can do. There will absolutely be people who skip her wedding to attend yours. If your entire family is not as financially established, then there will be households that have to choose which wedding they can attend as they are so close together and may involve travel and lodging.", "NTA and I get the impression that you\u2019re viewing this with a lot of compassion, OP, especially seeing as you\u2019re acting out of love for your fianc\u00e9 and not any showiness or desire to one-up. It\u2019s not fair that your sister can\u2019t have an expensive wedding, but part of life is that we are sometimes expected to be happy for people when they have things that we don\u2019t! Your sister should focus on what the day\u2019s about: that husband-to-be of hers! After all, how many lonely gals out there would be able to ask OP\u2019s sister to tone it down with her partner when there are lonely and single people out there!! Same logic!!! \n\nIf you eloped, would your sister have to tone her ceremony down to \u201ckeep it even???\u201d", "NTA\n\nIf you don't mind, i would like to give you some advices that you can share with your sister. \n\nI disagree with her demands but i hope she's not like this always and maybe by giving her some advices you can help her relax and enjoy her wedding. \n\nShe shouldn't think about stuff like that...\n\nEven a smaller-budget wedding can be more beautiful than many expensive ones.\n\nIf you really want to help her in a way, tell her to make sure the food tastes really really good.\n\nIt doesn't have to be expensive food. It just have to taste really good.\n\nThe cake also should be a good one. I don't know how she will manage the drinks part, don't know the prices in your area, don't know if she will be having drinks so there's no advice here. \n\nAnd the rest of the wedding...\n\nIf she is happy marrying the man she loves, she should enjoy her day, her wedding.\n\nPeople will talk about the food (&drinks) & the happy couple.\n\nShe cannot reasonable expect you to do the same wedd, with the same budget. That would be worse. People will then have a chance to compare the weddings.\n\nBut she must think about something else: she will have 70 people, close friends and family. She won't be stressed because she doesn't know a guest (sorry, i don't want to scare you or something, i think it would help your sister).\n\nI cannot think of any other advice for you.\n\nI hope you can solve this issue so that you both be happy on your wedding days. \n\nThanks and sorry if i upset you!", "Nta", "NTA - It gets tiring that so many people expect others to not spend or so things because they cannot.", "NTA. You can't tone down your wedding to even come close to matching Ash's. She would still be upset, no matter which fancy details you cut, and Julie would feel disappointed. \n\nMake your bride happy.", "Right? I feel like this is just based in jealousy. There\u2019s no wrongdoing on OPs part.", "Come on, now. Thrifty doesn't mean \"absolute bare minimum.\" It means spending within your means to get as much as you can for your dollars. 1000 dollars for 70 guests at a wedding is VERY thrifty.", "Since Ash's military wedding is a rush job, we can safely assume the fancy wedding was planned first.", "It\u2019s their wedding, they can do whatever they want. It\u2019s not their responsibility to tone down their lifestyle just so other people don\u2019t feel some kind of way about it.", "I hear you but her parents didn't offer us a large amount for an investment account. They offered this huge budget for a wedding. It does feel a little crazy for me but if they're offering it it seems foolish to turn it down.", "Her parents are giving them money for a wedding. It\u2019s not his place to demand that they use the money for something else. \n\nHe didn\u2019t ask if it was financially wise to spend a lot on a wedding, he asked if he was an AH for not changing his wedding plans to meet his sister\u2019s demands. You think it\u2019s frivolous, the people who run the small businesses that make up the majority of the wedding industry would probably disagree.", "Well that *was* the first thing I said lol. And I didn\u2019t mention Toning it down for the sibling at all. I simply made my case that big weddings in general that you otherwise couldn\u2019t afford are frivolous. Thought it was pretty clear lol", "You and your fianc\u00e9e are free to have whatever kind of wedding you would like. It\u2019s not your fault if others feel insecure or upset by how much money your fianc\u00e9e\u2019s parents decide to spend on their only daughter\u2019s wedding. \nThe entitlement of other people is astounding.", "I get why your sister is feeling insecure, but if it makes your sister feel any better, I had the high society wedding that you\u2019re having and my sister had what sounds pretty similar to what your sister is having. Our weddings were both awesome and incomparable. \n\n\nWe have different types of friends, different party vibes, and had different interests in how our weddings would be. So it was silly to even compare them and our guests had a great time at each of our parties. \n\n\nJust remind your sister that if her friends come and bring the joy and there is enough food, music, and alcohol, people are going to have a great time. And that you will be there, helping to pump everyone up and keep the party rolling.\n\n\nNAH. Support your sis and let her know no matter what she throws, it\u2019s gonna rock and you are gonna be there with bells and whistles on.", "In the end, you\u2019re not the asshole because your spouses parents are insisting on this and it could be seen as a sign of disrespect if there\u2019s a cultural aspect to this. However, as someone who also comes from a low income, you def know having a wedding like that is totally over the top and frivolous if you personally can\u2019t afford that type of lifestyle.", "No, that wasn\u2019t clear. Your entire comment comes off as judgy. You also didn\u2019t offer any judgment on the actual question OP asked. Just went on about how just because they\u2019ve got the money there to have a \u201clavish\u201d wedding doesn\u2019t mean they should do that.", "Then perhaps you didn\u2019t understand my comment. They *don\u2019t* have the money. Someone else is paying for it. If his spouses parents weren\u2019t footing the bill, he\u2019d be having the same wedding his sibling is. The parents are throwing the wedding THEY want because THEY can afford it. Big weddings you can\u2019t afford are a waste of money.", "Again, you\u2019re being judgy. If his fianc\u00e9e\u2019s parents want to spend what you perceive as a ridiculous amount of money on their only daughter\u2019s wedding that\u2019s up to them. They gave them the money as a gift and the engaged couple is having the wedding they want to have. The money was gifted on the condition it\u2019s used for the wedding.\n\nEdit - spelling"]}
