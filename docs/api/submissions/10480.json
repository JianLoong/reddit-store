The weddings were not planned to be so close, it just kind of worked out that way. I got engaged first but her husband is in the military so they had to rush things a little bit and either get married on 5 months notice or wait a lot longer. \n\nMy family grew up what would be considered lower middle class. My parents are gifting Ash $1,000 to help with wedding planning, obviously this doesn't go that far. We have a decent size extended family and lots of friends. Ash is doing everything she can to be thrifty and will end up having around 70 adult guests at her wedding. She wishes it could be more and with kids, but due to budget cuts had to be made. My fiancee Julie is from a very well off family and with her being their only daughter they are being extremely generous with the wedding budget. I don't want to say how much they've given us but it's more than most households make in a year. It still feels a little surreal marrying into a family like this but I will say they've been nothing but kind to me and Ive never felt judged by them.\n\nWe will be inviting the entire extended family - kids included, and lots of friends as well. We've invited about 250 people and are expecting around 150-200. Ash knew my wedding would have more people but I don't think she realized until this weekend how nice it will be. We saw each other this weekend and while wedding planning came up it was pretty clear how fancy ours is going to be. The food served will be over $150/plate, it's one of the most expensive venues in the area, and the musical performer is relatively well known (family friend of Julies).  Ash asked me if I could \"tone it down\" so it's not so much bigger and better than hers and so people don't compare or skip hers for mine. I told her that her wedding will be amazing and not to compare but I won't be telling Julie to not have her wedding how she wants it. Personally I'd elope or have a giant wedding, it makes no difference to me but Julie wants an extravagant affair and if her parents don't mind paying, Im fine with it too. Ash says I'm being an AH for not even considering otherwise and my mom insinuated that she agreed.

Your fiancee is a part of this event (a crucial part, obv.) and gets a say on how your wedding is planned, which has nothing whatsoever to do with your sister, not to mention that a good chunk of the extravagance is due to her side of the family paying for it. Regardless of how Ash feels, that's not something she gets a say in and it would be a hard hill to climb to try and tone down your wedding for her sake, even if you wanted to.\n\nFrom someone who had a relatively bare bones wedding about a month away from a friend's very posh wedding (with a fair amount of friend crossover), I can say that both events were well enjoyed and it's the attitude and tone of the event that people remember fondly. Hard to hear when you're pinching pennies and trimming a guest list, but it's true in the long run and hopefully something Ash will realize.", "NTA \n\nYour future in-laws are paying for your wedding. I'm sure if the wedding cost were up to you and / or your parents, you'd not have such an extravagant wedding. \n\nYour sister needs to grow up and realize that the world does not revolve around her. Same with your mother.", "NTA. I was in Ash's shoes. Military weddings tend to be cheap. I had a month to plan mine. I would never have asked either of my sisters to change their weddings to match mine. I wouldn't want to do that to them. Julie deserves the wedding of her dreams, and if her parents are willing to splurge, they have every right to do so.", "NTA We all have to live within our budgets. You are lucky to have a large budget and many do not including your sister. It's not the money which makes a wedding anyway. The most fun wedding I ever attended was not a huge budget affair. So long as you don't lord it over your sister, which you are not, then her request is not reasonable.", "NTA - But if you do have extended family who skip hers to attend yours because yours will be \"nicer\" then they are definitely the AH. I hope your extended family know that if they made the cut for your sister that it is an indication of how much she values that relationship given her limited resources.", "NTA. Don't adjust your wedding to accomodate your sister's insecurities.", "NTA\n\nPart of being an adult with siblings is realizing your lives won't necessarily be economically equal due to things like luck, decisions, hard work, and who/if you marry. Is she going to ask you to not buy a house if she and her husband can't?", "NTA. I mean your sister is correct that some people will compare (hopefully not out loud!). It's just human nature since the weddings are close. However, her request for you to change your wedding plans is unreasonable. If the situation were reversed, would she \"tone\" down her wedding to make it more in line with yours? I think not.", "NTA- It's your wedding, the day should be as close to perfect for you and your partner.", "NTA. That makes no more sense than you telling her to \"tone it up\".", "NTA. She\u2019s asking you to tone down your fiance\u2019s wedding. That\u2019s crazy, but I\u2019m glad you told her that you weren\u2019t gonna do that. That\u2019s so unfair of her\u2026", "NTA. Your sisters wedding and what she can afford has nothing to do with your fianc\u00e9 and your wedding. It\u2019s pretty weird to even care about it honestly. Ash just seems jealous.", ">Ash asked me if I could \"tone it down\" so it's not so much bigger and better than hers\n\nThe first word that came to mind after reading this was \"selfish\". You, Julie, and her family are all supposed to alter the plans for your wedding just to make Ash feel better about her own wedding? Hell no. \n\nNTA", "NTA.  Although you are siblings your weddings are completely separate events.  There will probably be comparisons made but just because one wedding is extravagant it doesn't mean the other one won't be special in its own way.  \n\nLots of people think big weddings are a waste of money so your family isn't necessarily going to think that Ash's wedding is inferior.  They don't have to be the same.", "This is really strange.  Most people on the planet are in a position where some can afford more than they, and some can do less.  Pretty much a fact of adult life.  Sis needs to (grow up a little) relax and celebrate both events.  NTA", "NTA.\n\nSince hers will be first, no one is going to be comparing the two at her wedding.  I very much doubt anyone will skip hers to be at yours, but if they do, then they will be able to save even more.\n\nYou're spending $30K on food alone.  There's no way to meaningfully tone down that type of wedding to make it more comparable to hers.  The most you can do is not to mention the entertainer or the details of the menu in the invitations.\n\nYou are right to refuse to talk to Julie or her parents about it.  Because if you do, and they refuse (or even if they tone it down but not \"enough\")  then THEY are the AHs instead of you.", "NTA. Your sister will have a lovely ceremony and reception, and it will mean everything to her because she's done what she wants with what she has, including the limited budget. Your wife-to-be will feel the same. \n\nComparison isn't appropriate: the needs and circumstances are different. Either way, it's not your responsibility to change the situation.", "NTA.  You and your fianc\u00e9 can be as extravagant as YOU feel comfortable being with your wedding. Have fun at both celebrations ,", "Absolutely not.", "NTA, at some point people will learn that the whole world can't accomodate them... Not today though. You are right, your fiancee wants a grand wedding and had means to pay for it, without asking your family to contribute. So your family or anyone else for that matter, have no say here. As long as you and her are happy with the arrangement and have means to pay, you are fine.", "NTA. Yes, life isn't fair, and some people have more money than others. That means that some people will have more luxurious experiences, and bigger weddings, than others. But such is the way, you are not doing it to \"outshine\" Ash or humiliate her with your display of wealth, it's just what it is.", "Tough situation, but NTA.", "NTA. \nYou have a right to have your day be how you envision it. I'm sorry your sister us insecure, but that's on her.", "NTA. If she didn\u2019t want the weddings close together, she and her fianc\u00e9 could have waited. They chose to have a date close to yours. \n\nJust because your sister is feeling insecure doesn\u2019t mean you and your partner don\u2019t get the wedding you want and can afford.", "NTA. The whole day is just a celebration of the couple after all, getting caught up on the finery and jealousy takes away from the fact that it's about celebrating their love and starting a life together.", "I can totally get why she's feeling that way and honestly think fairly poorly of weddings so outrageous but it's your wedding do as you want. I feel badly for your sister though because yeah hers will likely be skipped and definitely overshadowed regardless if that's right or not. Even though I don't like weddings like yours NTA because it's your wedding and not doing anything wrong. Nothing wrong with her asking but calling you an AH isn't okay either.", "NTA. You'll (hopefully) only get married once. (Congratulations btw!) It's the one day in your and your fiancee's lives that will be all about the two of you. You don't have to \"tone it down\" to soothe your sister's ego.\n\n>My parents are gifting Ash $1,000 to help with wedding planning, obviously this doesn't go that far.\n\nNonsense. That much money will pay for a marriage license, a nice meal afterward, and then some.\n\n>Ash is doing everything she can to be thrifty \n\n>and will end up having around 70 adult guests at her wedding. She wishes it could be more and with kids\n\n70 guests is not thrifty. Your sister, her betrothed, and the minimum number of witnesses required would be thrifty.", "NTA. It's Julie's wedding, you don't have the option to tone it down.", "NTA -\n\nHowever, this may cause a life-long rift between you and your sister, especially if she believes (rightly or wrongly) that people skipped her wedding to attend yours. \n\nThe timing is lousy, and that is no one's fault really.  Two weddings a month apart is - for out-of-town guests -  two sets of hotels, eating out,  travel expenses,  taking time off from work, and so on.   So your sister is right to feel that people may skip out on her more modest wedding to get the \"experience\" that your upscale event will give them. \n\nYou don't have to change your plans for her.  But please don't be angry at your sister even if she gets angry at you.", "NTA poor people issues", "INFO\n\nWho's wedding was planned and on the books first?", "You and your spouse are free to do what you want regardless, but it\u2019s an incredibly frivolous thing to do. Sparing no expense and going all out on a wedding inviting 300+ people, more than half of which you\u2019ll probably never talk to again just seems very out of touch in this day and age. Just because you can afford the Charles and Diana wedding doesn\u2019t mean you should have one that lavish. Especially when, no offense, most who do haven\u2019t done nearly anything in life to deserve or warrant being celebrated so feverishly. \n\nIt would be much wiser to have a modest wedding and take the money you would have spent and invest it into your actual future.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It\u2019s not fair that your sister can\u2019t have an expensive wedding, but part of life is that we are sometimes expected to be happy for people when they have things that we don\u2019t! Your sister should focus on what the day\u2019s about: that husband-to-be of hers! After all, how many lonely gals out there would be able to ask OP\u2019s sister to tone it down with her partner when there are lonely and single people out there!!

It just have to taste really good.\n\nThe cake also should be a good one.

There\u2019s no wrongdoing on OPs part.", "Come on, now. Thrifty doesn't mean \"absolute bare minimum.\" It means spending within your means to get as much as you can for your dollars. 1000 dollars for 70 guests at a wedding is VERY thrifty.", "Since Ash's military wedding is a rush job, we can safely assume the fancy wedding was planned first.", "It\u2019s their wedding, they can do whatever they want. It\u2019s not their responsibility to tone down their lifestyle just so other people don\u2019t feel some kind of way about it.", "I hear you but her parents didn't offer us a large amount for an investment account.

It\u2019s not his place to demand that they use the money for something else. \n\nHe didn\u2019t ask if it was financially wise to spend a lot on a wedding, he asked if he was an AH for not changing his wedding plans to meet his sister\u2019s demands. You think it\u2019s frivolous, the people who run the small businesses that make up the majority of the wedding industry would probably disagree.", "Well that *was* the first thing I said lol. And I didn\u2019t mention Toning it down for the sibling at all. I simply made my case that big weddings in general that you otherwise couldn\u2019t afford are frivolous. Thought it was pretty clear lol", "You and your fianc\u00e9e are free to have whatever kind of wedding you would like. It\u2019s not your fault if others feel insecure or upset by how much money your fianc\u00e9e\u2019s parents decide to spend on their only daughter\u2019s wedding. \nThe entitlement of other people is astounding.", "I get why your sister is feeling insecure, but if it makes your sister feel any better, I had the high society wedding that you\u2019re having and my sister had what sounds pretty similar to what your sister is having.

That said, I am sympathetic that likely a lot of family/friends will skip her wedding in favor of yours, and yes, that's going to hurt her. Of course that's not you or your fiance's fault, but I understand why your sister is sad about it. Also people can be pretty ruthless and judgy when it comes to other people's weddings - your events will be compared by those who attend both. Hopefully people are nice enough not to do it in front of you and your sister though (and if they do, I hope you at least stand up for her I guess).\n\nYou're not doing anything wrong, and your sister shouldn't ask you to tone things down. But just have some sympathy for her because some people are probably gonna be dicks about comparing your wedding.", "NTA but be graceful about it. It has to be really hard to be on the cheaper end of this. You are absolutely NTA for having the wedding you want, but keep discussion about prices and details about extravagant plans to yourself. That's just a way to make her feel worse and probably isn't necessary to discuss anyway.", "NTA. Your future wife's family is paying so she can have the wedding of her dreams. It's beyond rude of your sister to ask you to tone it down because she can't afford something similar. If she wants a more lavish wedding she can do a civil ceremony now and save up for a celebration at a later date.", "\"Very well off\" and \"more than most households make in a year\", so really, you mean extremely rich.  150-200 people times $150/plate means the food alone is costing up to $30,000  I'm guessing the wedding will cost at least $100k and probably more.  People are dying because they can't afford housing, food, and medicine, but go ahead and spend all this money on a one-day event so people will be \"impressed.\"", "NTA", "NTA. Just say yes. In situations like this, there is no way to know if you actually toned it down or not. They'll come to the wedding and later on you can always say it was supposed to be even bigger. You upsetting your sister does you no good, even if you are 100% right. Just keep peace.", "NTA. You\u2019re not responsible for your sister\u2019s envy. Weddings are not competitions and it\u2019s rude AF to compare events of two couples in vastly different circumstances. Enjoy your day.", "NTA another post where someone is demanding you tear yourself down to appease them. 'If I cant have it you cant have it either,' attitude. My brother's wedding was far more expensive than mine, but it was very formal and stiff and his wife's family were unfriendly. Mine had less money spent on it, but my husband's lovely family really pulled together for us, cutting flowers in their gardens and decorating the church with beautiful arrangements. It had a totally different feel. My daughter had a very relaxed ceremony on the beach just with immediate family. Sometimes simple, friendly events can end up being the weddings people really remember.", "NTA - BUT you and your fiancee are now obligated to get your sister a really nice wedding gift.", "NTA you do that now, your family will continuously asking you to tone down your lifestyle or show up with their hands out. \n\nIt will be constantly asking your wife to tone down bridal shower, baby shower and all future milestones.

My dh was his best man and he was my dh's best man.\n\nTheir wedding was MUCH fancier than ours and of course most of the same people were invited to both.\n\nI never once heard anyone compare the two. Everyone enjoyed each one separately and had a great time at both weddings. \n\nOP help your sister to focus on how great her wedding will be and maybe just tone down the talk about your wedding plans - only the talk, not that actual wedding.", ">a good chunk of the extravagance is due to her side of the family paying for it\n\nI imagine that this is also an indicator of the social expectations of the bride's family too and it would be rude to ignore that (and OP's fiance's feelings) just to make the sister feel better.\n\nPersonally, I think it's silly that the size and opulence of a wedding may have an impact on someone's social capitol ... but that doesn't mean that it's not a real concern.", "I did my wedding on the cheap\u2014our budget was $5K for the wedding and honeymoon *combined*, at a time when the average wedding cost $15K.\n\nFor years afterward people told me it was one of the nicest weddings they\u2019d ever been to\u2014not because I killed myself DIYing everything we couldn\u2019t afford, but because it was laid-back, and because it truly reflected us.\n\nIt\u2019s sad that Ash feels like she needs to compete. She should focus on making her wedding a reflection of who she and her fianc\u00e9 really are. Do that, and no one will compare the two weddings\u2014because hers will be unique, and perfectly suited to them.", "100% agree. One of the most enjoyable weddings I attended was in a rural UP garage with much less than 100 people. The energy and love was flowing and that's something you can't buy. Different people contributed unique parts of the reception, there was an overall vibe of acceptance without judgment. OP is NTA and they didn't even mention the sibling launching a wedding right in front of theirs date-wise.", "This...to the point and perfect", "Was about to say something similar.", "My husband and I went to city hall with his sister and their partner as our witnesses with sushi and a bar afterwards. When sister and partner were married, it was a beautiful affair at a country club. All of us were just happy to be able to be there for the others.", "It really isn\u2019t.\n\nOP is having his event within the budget and lifestyle he\u2019s marrying.\n\nOPs Sister is having the same.", "Yep, I have four married siblings, all our weddings were very different in expense, formality, and theme. If anyone thought it was weird, they smartly kept it to themselves. Like you, we were just happy to celebrate together, whatever that looked like.", "It\u2019s tough because it\u2019s awkward / sucks to know your sister is upset about your fancy wedding. Sadly it will probably continue throughout life as OP is marrying into money.", "Yeah so the girl planned the rush wedding a month before her brother's because she knew the brother's wedding would be nicer\n\nSeems to me OP's sister is just struggling with the fact that she isn't going to get her Pretty Princess Wedding of her dreams and resents that her brother gets one even though he doesn't actually give a crap about the wedding at all...he just wants to marry his fiance", "NTA. The wedding-industrial complex has just gotten so far under your sister's skin that she's confusing the fanciness of her  wedding with her intrinsic worth as a person. I hate that for her, but it's between her and her psyche and not something you and your partner can control.", "NTA\n\nOnly @ssholes compare sibling weddings", "Nta but spending what most make in a year is disgusting can you even afford your wife's life style or are you planning on living off your inlaws", "NTA. Everyone should have the wedding they want and most importantly can afford. People should stop comparing and just enjoy the event for what it\u2019s meant to be which is a celebration of the couple. Its ridiculous to stress over making it the most expensive and \u201camazing\u201d day. Most weddings no matter how much is spent are pretty typical, uncreative, and not so fun for the guests anyway. I don\u2019t get the jealousy when your basically doing the exact same thing with different budgets lol. It all looks the same to me anyway. \n\nPersonally (in my experience) once its over you will kind of feel silly for feeling like there was so much pressure to throw money at it and have everything be absolutely perfect. I\u2019m just thankful that I didn\u2019t fall when \u201cwalking\u201d down the \u201caisle\u201d especially since I was on roller skates and the \u201caisle\u201d was a skating rink! Bragging a little bit but our guests keep wanting us to do our wedding over again because it was an absolute blast for everyone. And thats what you want. An amazing time for all and don\u2019t worry about anyone else\u2019s wedding. Do yours how you want it done.", "NTA", "NTA not honestly who cares about the cost? After the weddings you\u2019ll see that the cost is not what matters. One of my friends was due to marry in 2020 in a giant grade listed building with gorgeous grounds and a guest list of 150. Covid screwed that plan and after much back and forth they decided to go ahead with a smaller wedding of 30 in 2021 (maximum allowed with covid). The ceremony was at the church as normal and venue where the food was was basically a Yurt.. but they put florals all over and it honestly looked great. When you have to pick 30 people its hard but she had 30 of her absolute ride or die friends/family and its hands down the best wedding i\u2019ve ever been to and i\u2019ve been to weddings with six figure budgets. The people make your wedding. No one will remember the food, the decor, the venue even. All those details you slave over? No one but you cares or even notices.", "NTA it\u2019s not about the wedding, it\u2019s about who you are marrying. \nIt\u2019s not your fault her wedding is so close to yours. It\u2019s not your fault they don\u2019t have the same budget. I am sure there are a lot of low budget weddings witch are just awesome and that there are a lot of high budget weddings witch are not. \nSo enjoy your fancy wedding and don\u2019t feel bad. Maybe don\u2019t discuss so much about the weddings with her if it only makes her upset.", "NTA.   Ash is way off base expecting Julie to settle for less because she had to.\nShe could have waited if she wanted the big wedding or she could have done the civil thing and had a huge reception when time permitted.  Don\u2019t change a thing. In this instance brides choice prevails.", "NTA I feel bad for your sister but she doesn\u2019t get to dictate how you and your fianc\u00e9 plan and spend for your wedding. She should consider eloping and sending out wedding announcements and save up for a large family reception party for a wedding anniversary, if she is having money trouble. Some people just want to dim other\u2019s light to make theirs shine brighter. If the shoe was on the other foot do you think she\u2019d tone down her wedding for you? She\u2019s just really jealous and probably a little embarrassed that she can\u2019t have the same. Not your fault, nor your fianc\u00e9 fault.", "NTA bit ultimately fancy doesn't equal better. Smaller can absolutely be more beautiful and romantic. I really don't like big weddings and chose to have only 38 guests at mine.", "NTA.\nYour wedding has nothing to do with theirs. She sounds like she\u2019s heading into bridezilla territory", "NTA I don\u2019t get this kind of thinking.", "Has she been on r/budgetweddings?   They have some great ideas.\n\nI went to 5 weddings within two months. they weren\u2019t that far apart in budget (except one which was like yours and definitely more).\n\nI don\u2019t remember comparing food or music. Honestly can\u2019t remember what was served at any of them.   It\u2019s the small details that you remember.\n\nOne couple was into traveling so the they had all their guest sign a globe they painted white instead of a guest book.   One handed out cookies before people left.   Plants instead of flowers as centerpieces- I got to take one home and it\u2019s still alive (yeah!)\n\nHopefully she can make a beautiful day for herself and future husband.\n\nOh and NTA", "NTA. Honestly one of my favorite weddings I attended was out in the country; they brought in a beer truck and had music and food. Not fancy in the slightest. And everyone had an amazing time! But I get the pressure she\u2019s feeling - the wedding industry is obnoxious. I\u2019m sure both of your weddings will be lovely!", "NTA. Different life situations sometimes make for discomfort among family members. Life's not fair and nobody ever said it was.", "NTA--I can see how your sister feels, but it's not a competition. You're doing the right thing by supporting your wife-to-be and if her family is paying for it, then it's clearly not favoritism from the parents.\n\nI get that she had to hurry because of her man being in the military, but that's not your fault. Just try to help her see how amazing her own day is going to be, and remind her about the \"not a competition\" thing.", "NTA. Honestly how fun a wedding is has very little to do with how fancy it is. More formal events often feel stuffy and boring. Some of the best food I\u2019ve had at a wedding was backyard bbq - much better than plated food on expensive china. Hopefully she can lean into the positives of her event instead of thinking a huge formal event is the only way it can be good.", "NTA, it\u2019s your wedding and you should have it how you want it, but I understand your sister point of view. To have to be thrifty and not be able to have who you want there just to see her sibling\u2019s wedding be so lavish must hurt her self esteem.", "We had a wedding of around 85 by choice, not due to finances. Highly recommend. I spoke with everyone there, we were relaxed and had lots of fun. \n\nRemind your sister that hers will be more personal, more intimate and that she should highlight that and embrace it. Also make sure you have the BEST time at her wedding. \n\nYours will be special in a different way.", "NTA. This is a ridiculous ask. I realize your sister has some sort of inferiority complex going on, but where does this stop for her and you? Are you going to be subjected to years of her asking you to buy a smaller house, a cheaper car, have fewer kids, give less nice Christmas presents? At the end of the day this is not your sister's wedding, it's yours and Julie's. I think you know that.", "Hahahaha!\n\nGo ahead, try it.  Just TRY to tell Julie to tone it down.  Just let me get the popcorn first.\n\nNTA, and lord help you if you acquiesce.", "NTA", "Two of my husband's brothers had relatively fancy weddings.  Years earlier, we'd made it legal in his parent's living room, with two of those brothers sitting on the couch (their mom made them wear ties).  We still like teasing them that we still prefer OUR wedding...\n\nThe important bit is the marriage. A big party is fun, but it's no guarantee of what the marriage will be. \n\nI hope OP and partner have a wonderful posh wedding, and a long and happy marriage. Sis needs to let go of her envy.", "Dress uniforms make even the most quickly planned wedding look great. Just sayin.", "I told her that. She brought up the kids thing which is a fair point. Adding the kids of my extended family adds about 30 total guests so I think she's worried if it's hard to get away for two weekends, just picking the one where they can bring the whole family. It seems to be a valid concern but I still think she'll get a nice turnout. \n\nFunny thing is,  Ima little jealous of her for having a childfree wedding lol", "It could also be that they can only afford to come to one and OP\u2019s was planned first - even if it is second on the calendar.", "This is a great comment, thanks.", "This is the answer I was looking for. NTA. But, this is now going to be a thing in the family forever. It sucks, but there's not really anything reasonable that can be done.", "It's wild to me too, I grew up poor. They're a nice family though who have only treated me kindly and with generosity.", "Touchy subject", "Thats my parents contribution, which was a lot for them, not their total budget. Im not sure the total budget but I know she and he fianc\u00e9 are paying for pretty much all of it", "Thats cos people who go to your wedding (hopefully) are there to celebrate you, have a great time and a party.", "It's like comparing a gala to a bbq.  Both can be equally fun, given the right people to spend it with.", "Yah I don\u2019t know why people think that bigger means better \n\nMy college friend got married In a family friend\u2019s backyard. Her MIL helped to make the dress. Simple meal catered. It was so lovely. \n\nI still remember it very fondly, just as I do my own elopement with our $250 Las Vegas wedding 20 years ago - and while I can admire the fancy opulent weddings, I wouldn\u2019t change a thing about mine.", "Ash will realise this hopefully. After the event maybe. I know we ploughed money into things that we thought we needed or wanted to make it look amazing and no one noticed. They came for us.", "Or if she feels like her current wedding doesn't reflect them, she needs to sit down with stbh and discuss if they really need to rush things... they can always elope for legal reasons and have a proper ceremony on a time more convenient for their plans.", "This would absolutely be a thing. My mom\u2019s from a culture where weddings are huge multi day affairs. \n\nSome of my cousins weddings were absolutely enormous and yes the parents paid for it all. It was 90% parents friends and business partners etc and 10% bride and groom\u2019s guests.", "It\u2019s just hard not to compare when the weddings are for siblings and so close together. I completely get why sister feels some kind of way about it, but asking her SIL to \u201ctone down\u201d her wedding isn\u2019t a reasonable ask.", "It\u2019s give or take three months to the wedding. RSVPs should be coming in.  She\u2019ll know shortly.", "She planned the rushed wedding because her fiance is getting deployed. It's not OP's fault, but there's no need to invent a whole story about how his sister is a shallow princess."]}
