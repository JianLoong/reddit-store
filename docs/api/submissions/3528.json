Obviously, we\u2019re both proud of this, but my sister often brags to an extent that many in our family find uncomfortable or discouraging and she talks down to the people around her. When she began her program, she explained it in very technical terms that confused our aunt. When she was asked to clarify, my sister made a fuss about how it was so easy for her to understand and she forgets that not everyone can wrap their heads around it.

When we were eating, my sister was asked about her research and she went on a long, complicated spiel about her work. She was missing context, pulling out every ten cent word, getting super technical, and under-explaining every concept. She talked for about ten minutes straight, barely pausing for questions or comments. It dominated conversation. Eventually, I interrupted her and tried asking our dad about his work. My sister interrupted him and said she wasn\u2019t finished, then continued talking. I told her I was finished listening to her and that she could talk all she wanted, but she\u2019d need to do it in another room. She made some comments about my hosting and continued on. I stopped her again and told her that nobody was interested and she needed to be quiet, which she did. It was, admittedly, extremely awkward and quiet and my husband decided to just plow on and make conversation with an aunt of mine. After that, conversation carried on as usual with my sister being very, very quiet.\n\nAfterwards, our parents scolded me for being rude but said my sister *was* being over the top, but I should\u2019ve just let her talk. A few of our other relatives thanked me for cutting her off. \n\nHer fianc\u00e9 called me yesterday morning and said I embarrassed my sister and made her feel ashamed. He implied I was jealous of her success and asked me to formally apologize to her. I said I\u2019d apologize to her but I wouldn\u2019t mean it and he hung up on me. \n\nI\u2019ve thought it over and I can see how my approach was wrong, but I genuinely did not see any other option at the time.

Conscious of it or not, jealousy and resentment oozes out of this entire post.

It\u2019s great she\u2019s so excited about her PhD work, but she needs to learn which level of explanation is appropriate for which groups of people.\n\nOP needs to learn how to redirect a conversation without being an AH about it.  Especially if you are the host, then you are responsible for *all* of your guests feeling welcome and respected in your home.", "ESH - yeah I get that your sister was dominating the conversation and obviously wants to be the smartest person in the room, but you were kind of rude. If how she conducts herself at family events is a problem then the time to discuss it isn't at the dinner table in front of everyone.", "ESH, Everybody Sucks Here\n\nYou and your sister both need to work on your social skills. Monopolizing the dinner discussion is indeed rude, but you telling her \"nobody was interested\" is worse. \n\nDon't apologize and don't expect an apology, both would likely be insincere.", "ESH.  Even if she's being TA by oversharing, saying it the way you did was horribly rude and dismissive.  It would have been more useful to say something like \"Hey sis, I think you're losing everyone with all the technical details.  Think you could summarize?\"\n\nWhat you are interpreting as condescension could simply be her being excited about her work and trying to make sure everyone understands why, and then being frustrated about it.", "ESH - Did you have a conversation with your sister to tell her that she comes off that way? I mean, yes, someone did ask but you could easily say \" so since we dont understand the technical stuff, can you give us the summary version?\". Her acting like a snob doesnt help but there is a chance that she doesnt realize that is how she comes off.", "ESH\n\nHer being tone deaf to dinner conversation sucks. And your telling her that nobody cares sucks. \n\nBut with that said, I can relate to how you feel. I have a friend who's getting his PhD (he's finishing his thesis project) and I roll my eyes inwardly because the conversations  tend to center around his subject matter and it gets tiresome. I try to understand, though, as he's in his 50's and this is his life's dream. It's natural that he would be consumed by it. I imagine your sister is in his shoes.\n\nI would never tell my friend that nobody cares about what he's talking about, though, because that's hurtful and rude. I've learned to re-direct the conversation altogether or ask him questions that leads conversation towards another topic.", "YTA\n\n1. You sound jealous.\n2.

You could've pulled her aside and asked her to tame it down a bit instead of embarrassing her in front of everyone. Super childish.", "ESH, but mostly you. I'm a master's student who's aspiring for the PhD track, and I'm currently working on a graduate thesis. People in my family sometimes ask me about it, and I try to simplify it for them, but when you work on deep research, it's really easy to get into a tangent. I think you're being way too harsh on your sister, and you didn't need to be rude and cruel to her. Just because you were sick of hearing her academic spiel didn't mean you had the right to speak for everyone else, or belittle something that is, in essence, the life work of your sister. If someone said something like that to me about MY research, I'd be crushed and embarrassed as hell. \n\nThat said, it's never cool to hold personal achievements over others, whether they be academic or otherwise. Your sister does sound like she needs to settle her jets around family.", "YTA - you handled that poorly. You assumed that no one else cared, but someone cared enough to ask and give her the opportunity to brag a bit.  Sometimes it's not about wanting the actual answer so much as it is just giving someone the opportunity to speak about something that excites them.\n\nAnd you weren't even the one to ask, so not only were you rude to her, you were rude to whomever cared enough to ask her to talk about it in the first place. Then you were rude to your father using him to block your sister from being to finish her speech.", "YTA (my opinion is along the same lines as a lot of other commenters) - I also wanted to provide some perspective on the other side that may be useful..\n\nMy parter and I are both educated (partner has an advanced college diploma and a degree and is almost licensed in his field of engineering, I'm working towards finishing my PhD). My partner is the most educated out of his immediate family (some have some college), and it can make family get togethers really lonely to be honest. No one asks myself or my partner how work is going or how my research is. Anytime they have asked and either of us says anything we're viewed as being on our high horse and condescending, even though that's never the intention. It has gotten to the point where we make small talk with family members we should be able to connect with on a deeper level. Just wanted to give some of the slip side perspective because although it sounds like your sister may need some guidance on the how/ when to chat about her studies (maybe something like \"I'm interested in how your work is going or what's going on your life with your PhD work but in microdoses because it gets to be a lot for someone whose not in your field or something)... It's important to show an interest and try and connect with her... Grad school work is lonely enough without feeling like no one in your family cares", "YTA you were rude. You could have said it differently. Like  \"soo in laymen's term?\"", "NTA.  Monologuing at a large family gathering is spectacularly rude.  After she was cut off she should have realized she exhausted her time.  She is not even trying to have a meaningful conversation.   She is just showing off.  Gross behavior.", "Clearly someone was interested in your sister's research, because they asked the question. So yes, YTA.\n\nI'll agree with you that she needs to be better at explaining what she does. That's generally a perspective that people develop with time - I know a lot of students who are awful at explaining what they do even to people who are experts in the field.", "ESH and you incorrect about no one wanting to hear because someone literally asked her. It does very much come off that you are jealous. Maybe talk to her and tell her to dumb it down so she doesnt come off pretentious. A PHD is hard work and should be bragged about. Good for her for not letting someone purposefully interrupt her but she needs to read the room and not go on and on. If people need clarification or are interested in more they will ask.", "Esh. She should learn that the true mark of understanding your topic is to be able to explain it simply enough for the average person, and you should learn how to be a more gracious host instead of just fully shutting something down when it\u2019s not like she wasn\u2019t asked in the first place", "ESH. It does not sound like she\u2019s just proud to me, it sounds like you\u2019ve spoken to her previously about the way she tries to make others seem less intelligent than her and she has doubled down on being annoying. Nobody needs to hear an in depth description, all she has to say is the aim of her thesis and a few interesting things she\u2019s discovered. Talking down to people is not okay, especially as it sounds like they\u2019ve not had the same privileges you two had. However, it was still rude to make a big scene at dinner.", "in this specific scenario that you're asking about i'm going to go with YTA. she was ASKED about her PHD, it's not like she was randomly bringing it up during thanksgiving dinner to flex. it was rude of you to interrupt when she clearly was not finished talking. furthermore, you decided to embarrass her in front of your entire family by telling her to 'finish the conversation in another room.' what an extremely rude thing to say. if you're jealous just say that???", "Yta\n\nJust because you don't care, doesn't mean no one cares. She was asked, and she was answering, you interrupted her. You should apologize for being so rude.", "YTA.  And you are literally talking out of both ends of your ass in the same post.\n\n> AITA for telling my sister nobody was interested in her PhD research?\n\n> my sister was asked about her research\n\nDo you not see the issue here?", "YTA. She was asked a question, dont just interrupt just because youre finished listening. Thats an AH move. Its also a shitty host move, not giving space to your guests.\n\nFurthermore, you agree to apologise, but say you wont mean it? Are you 7 years old?", "YTA. It can actually be really, really difficult to explain your research in laymans terms when you're in the thick of a phd. It takes time for researchers to learn how to do this.\n\nIn any case, she was asked about her research. She was excited and talking. You were incredibly rude; firstly interrupting her to change the subject and then telling her 'noone cares'. What on earth do you mean by not seeing any other option - you had plenty! Ask her to clarify the confusing bits or suck it up and listen politely. Tell her in private that she monopolises conversations sometimes. So many ways to not humiliate someone else like that. And your should feel embarrassed too tbh because it absolutely comes across as jealous behaviour.\n\nAnd now you know fine well you hurt someone else and you're 'not sorry'. Lovely.", "YTA\n\nInstead of being a supportive sibling, you roasted her.\n\nShe's clearly deep in the weeds of her subject and has some social shortcomings; but you're just mean.\n\nIf you want to help her and the rest of the family, bridge the gap. Learn enough about what she does to act as a translator for the rest of the family. Next time your sister is going down a rabbit hole of incomprehensible explanation, jump in with a supportive yet simplified recap. This will give your family a better understanding of what she does, and hopefully help her have some audience awareness. \n\nAlso, the fianc\u00e9 could also be helping on this front as well.", "YTA. Going to bring up [this XKCD](https://xkcd.com/2501/).", "Soft YTA. Yeah, it's super annoying that she's drenching her speech in inaccessible jargon, which is not suitable for conversation with non-academics. But you didn't have to flat out state \"nobody cares\" and tell her to stop talking. Another approach would've been to ask her questions, or ask her if we might move onto another subject because it's getting too technical or something.", "YTA - yes, she was being a prosey bore, but part of being a good hostess is managing things without insulting your guests, even if they are your sister.  I've found that what works with folks like this, espcially in bigger groups, is that if those being bored out of their minds simply turn to each other and speak quietly together.  When sis finds that no one is paying attention to her dissertation, she'll quiet down.  Nobody says that only one conversation can be held at the table at a time, particularly when it's good sized table.", "YTA but only a little bit. I used to have a friend that would get drunk and call herself an \u201calmost a PhD\u201d I didn\u2019t know that was a thing lol.

He had no common sense. \n\nI have a lawyer I have worked with for years that I really like. There have been a few times when I have had to ask him to reword opinion letters because while I understand him, most people would not. \nActual smart people do not need to brag that they are smart it\u2019s obvious. Maybe she has been put down about her intelligence in the past. Or maybe like me was always expected to do better because I texted well. There is IQ intelligence and emotional intelligence. It sounds like you have both but your sister doesn\u2019t. \n\nI have a half sister that we were not raised together. She\u2019s a super smart math professor and admits she doesn\u2019t have common sense. But I love her more than anything.

Book smart does not equal common sense.", "NTA. You may have embarrassed her, but what do you think she was trying to do to everyone at the table?

Redirect the conversation to how she\u2019s liking the experience versus the technical aspects of her research.

Communicating with laypeople is even more complex, just because you have to take something deeply intricate and complex and relate it to something people generally can understand without even knowing where those gaps in understanding might be.\n\nAdd to that that people without Ph.D. can be suspicious and hostile with people who do. It's so easy to make them feel talked down to without intending it. But think of it this way: I have mostly interacted with people who had Ph.D.s since I started graduate school. In a very short time having a Ph.D. does not feel special in any way. It feels like the lowest bar, because having a Ph.D. in no way assures you a job.

To them, how hard could it be to sit in class all day and study for the occasional test? They labor day in and day out to the point of exhaustion. Neither understands the other.

They need to understand the rigors of schooling might not entail physical labor, but the learning process is stressful and just as exhausting.

Lashing out in an unfocused way that just hurts her and diminishes the work involved in getting a PhD, doesn't achieve any good outcome.\n\nThe problem isn't that nobody cares about her work; it's that 1) she is failing to explain appropriately for the audience, and overwhelming people who aren't in her field and don't have the background for technical detail; 2) she is hurting you by constantly diminishing your own achievements/insulting your intelligence, and 3) she is selfish in taking more time than is polite at a family party to talk about herself. In short, she's treating everyone as a competitor she needs to prove herself against, and it's not healthy for anyone. \n\nI almost wonder if she's been finding her department somewhat cutthroat and isn't dealing with the stress well, or if she's got a bad case of imposter syndrome.

I think you were pretty rude and brutal in your approach and need to apologize with how you delivered the message.

She thinks and wants to be the best of the world (arrogant), but at the same time she has no actual material to back that up (lack of self confidence). People who are confident have their expectations to themselves matching with the material they have, so they don't need to put down others in order to feel secure about themselves. Next time you meet your sister, try to see her through this lens that she is a poor arrogant soul with little self confidence, and adjust your behavior accordingly (say you feel sorry for her, just let her talk, nod your head, and go \"I see\", \"great\", \"interesting\").\n\nShe needs to help herself to get out of this toxic personality.
