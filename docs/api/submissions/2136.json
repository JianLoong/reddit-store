Please show this to your husband.", "NTA", "NTA. Anyone saying different is definitely an AH.", "NTA, but you need to ditch these people because they sound psychotic.

The fact OP\u2019s husband didn\u2019t IMMEDIATELY shut down any of the blaming her for being a victim show\u2019s he\u2019s complacent in his family\u2019s BS and that this probably isn\u2019t the first time something along these lines has happened. \n\nChances are, he will always side with them.

Still doesn't make it her fault she was roofied.", "I can\u2019t tell if this is an actual response, or if this is sarcasm. Assuming genuine, I feel sorry for the world you live in. Under no circumstances is DRUGGING someone okay. And if you\u2019re apologetic towards it, excuse it, or choose to ignore the fact that she\u2019s a victim in it, you\u2019re in the wrong. Period. \n\nWhile yes, she was being petty as her response, it wasn\u2019t unwarranted. We don\u2019t have a lot of context. But there\u2019s enough to know that she was \n\n1. Drugged and forcibly made under the influence of a mind altering substance she wasn\u2019t expecting to take. Which has extreme ramifications on mental state. It\u2019s not fun, and is often extremely terrifying when you don\u2019t know what\u2019s happening. \n\n2. Made fun of for someone else drugging her. \n\nThere is no excuse for that behavior. If she was being hectic and causing a scene, she would have been removed from the venue. \n\nThe family is entirely in the wrong.", "Before I got roofied I was upset with my husband and went off on my own that\u2019s why my brother-in-law (he was there) said it happened because I was having a tantrum.", "My husband wouldn\u2019t ever drug me and my brother-in-law wouldn\u2019t either because he knows my husband would go ballistic if he did.", "Why?", "Yeah, it's victim blaming and it doesn't really matter. Someone was going to get roofied. You probably weren't the only one, tbh. People who do that shit play a numbers game. And what he should be mad at is that he's ashamed that he couldn't protect you and you need to point out that he's mad at you for -almost- getting assaulted, but someone else probably did. All that rape prevention talk boils down to 'make yourself less appealing to rapists so they'll rape someone else'. \n\nHow about we blame the person who slipped drugs in someone's drink instead of the person drugged. 'Went off alone'. Please. Were you wearing an outfit that said 'drug me so you can rape me'? Did you have a tantrum that involved screaming out that you wanted to have someone slip drugs in your drink? No. He's mad at the wrong person and your BiL is trash for blaming you at all.", "That's victim blaming. The fault lies in whoever intended to rape you. This is absolutely horrific behavior on his part. You need to run.", "You did nothing wrong. The fact even your parents are giving you hell for it tells me you probably grew up in an environment that didn\u2019t model healthy relationships. It ain\u2019t a leap to assume people blaming their child for being drugged weren\u2019t always wonderful to you or each other. \n\nI say this to make my point that your husband is definitely not a partner. It must be daunting to hear so many people say it. Consider we\u2019re all strangers, so while we don\u2019t know him or you personally? We also don\u2019t have reason to lie about it. \n\nDon\u2019t get pregnant by him. And consider if this is how you want to spend the next 50 years. \n\nNTA and I\u2019m so sorry that happened to you. I\u2019ve been roofied and it was terrifying.", "So he's blaming you as a victim and inferring that you had it coming because you were acting out. Why stay?", "How deep in denial can you be?  Your bil just confessed to drugging you as punishment for mouthing off to your man.  And your husband was absolutely party to it.", "Either one of them roofied you or they saw who did", "So, your proof that they wouldn't do it is that they know they'd get in trouble? Yea, that's ALWAYS the case. And sometimes people do it anyway. I'm not saying they did it but I am saying it's naive to not consider all the possiblities. Especially when the BIL drugging you fits in well with his reaction. If he had drugged you then of course he wouldn't be worried about your safety, he knew he had it handled the whole time.", "Um, what?  That's your defense of your BIL?  That he wouldn't drug YOU, because his brother would hurt him afterwards?", "Your husband won't even defend you after a STRANGER roofied you, why would he go ballistic if your brother-in-law that he goes partying with did?", "I thought the same thing too, then I was drugged, attacked and arrested by my ex. A week after our 7th anniversary. We have two children together.", "[removed]", ">Your bil just confessed to drugging you as punishment for mouthing off to your man.\n\nNo, he didn't. He victim-blamed her, but he didn't confess to doing anything.", "What is moronic about pointing out that OP\u2019s family should stop with the victim blaming?\n\nNTA", "[removed]", "and you sound like the kind of person that roofies drinks", "I notice you haven\u2019t answered the question.  Which really doesn\u2019t speak to your level of intelligence, because if there was a logical reason, surely you\u2019d be able to come up with more than insults.
