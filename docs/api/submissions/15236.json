Caden's mom died when he was a baby. My brother married Simone 2 years ago almost and they blended families. Simone has Bella 10 and Archie 9. Bella and Archie's dad died when they were 4 and 5.\n\nCaden was really excited about Bella and Archie and having siblings. My brother and Simone told him that he'd have a brother and a sister and they'd be buddies for life and really made him eager to live with Bella and Archie. But his experience with them has not been a positive one. They don't want to include him in anything, they seem to go out of their way to not spend time with him. \n\nExamples I have witnessed and have been told about by Caden: Bella and Archie will be outside playing with kids in the neighborhood and when Caden tries to join in and play with everyone Bella and Archie will go inside or they will go do their own thing away from the other kids and Caden. Caden said sometimes Bella and Archie have said no to him joining and Simone will tell her kids they cannot stop him from playing with everyone else.\n\nI witnessed this myself at Christmas. Kids in my parents neighborhood were outside playing with their new toys and stuff. Caden joined a little after and Bell and Archie left the larger group playing together and went off on their own. When their mom noticed she went outside to say they should join the group again and they said no, because they didn't want to play with Caden.\n\nSometimes my brother or Simone will break up the kids into different groups for some fun family time and Caden is always told they don't want to do that stuff with him. When my brother takes them Bella or Archie will try to wander off, when Simone takes them they always try to put her in the middle of stuff so it's not like they are playing or having fun with Caden.\n\nSeveral months ago, when I realized how much it bothered Caden, and how sad it made him, we started doing a water park or trampoline park near us for the occasional fun day out. He'd ask to invite his stepsiblings and given they are my step niece and nephew, that made sense. The kids have never said yes. They have been offered and they will say they don't want to come. So I still take Caden. But now Simone is bothered by this. Last time we went Caden had such a good time and he said it was the most fun he'd ever had, because he got to stay late on the trampoline for helping another kid who was there. I guess Simone was bothered by him enjoying that so much when her kids weren't there. I told Simone the Bella and Archie have always been invited but they never come. She told me I shouldn't be taking Caden either then. My brother said maybe it's better to just lay off for now and not to bring Caden along.\n\nSimone wasn't just happy there though and told me to consider my actions because I was being deliberately hurtful to her children.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1681984901, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12staix/aita_for_taking_just_my_nephew_fun_places_and_not/", "score": 1748, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Maybe they should be trying some family therapy/counseling or something, but one thing they definitely shouldn't do is keep trying an already failed concept ad infinitum.

Some key points to convey that:\r  \n\r  \nYou have Caden's best interests at heart. You want to give him opportunities to build positive memories, gain confidence in social situations and offset the disappointment of rejection from his stepsiblings. The occasional fun activities you plan with your nephew are meant to support him emotionally.\r  \n\r  \nBella and Archie have consistently chosen not to include Caden in their play or activities, despite repeated invitations and offers. Their behavior shows a lack of consideration for Caden's feelings, not yours. You cannot force them to spend time with Caden if they don't want to.\r  \n\r  \nSimone and your brother enabled Bella and Archie's exclusionary behavior instead of addressing it. They failed to set proper boundaries or consequences to promote inclusion and kindness. The blame lies with them, not you.\r  \n\r  \nYou did not deliberately hurt Bella and Archie. Invitations were extended but they were never taken up. Caden's joy at the activities had nothing to do with them or being deliberately spiteful. His happiness should not provoke guilt.\r  \n\r  \nBella and Archie's refusal to join occasional fun days out has nothing to do with you being hurtful. Their choices reflect their own unwillingness to build a closer bond with Caden, not any perceived attack on them. Do not let Simone manipulate you into thinking otherwise.\r  \n\r  \nYou have sought to promote a harmonious blended family environment for Caden's sake but cannot force relationships that are one-sided. Bella and Archie's neglect and rejection of their stepbrother is unjustified. Do not blame yourself for their poor behavior and coldheartedness.\r  \n\r  \nStay firm in your position. You have done nothing wrong by supporting your nephew and creating positive experiences for him. His stepsiblings and their parents need to do more to foster inclusiveness, not make him feel guilty for enjoying life. Do not hesitate to stand up for yourself if Simone continues to accuse you unjustly. You are fighting for what is right and in Caden's best interests.\r  \n\r  \nPlease let me know if you have any other questions or want further suggestions. I hope this has helped reinforce that you are absolutely not the asshole here.", "NTA \n\nSimone can kiss my ass. \n\nYou\u2019ve included her children and they don\u2019t care to go.

The mean kids don\u2019t want to go anyway. And why should they be rewarded for being mean? Maybe the little darlings will learn a thing or two.\n\nDon\u2019t change a thing. Tell them to back off.", "NTA - It might help to explain to your brother that if the stepsiblings were allowed to dictate whether Caden gets to go, that is deliberately hurtful to Caden. Why should their feelings be granted more importance than Caden's? That is what Simone is demanding - that Caden be brushed aside and her children be granted control over his ability to have fun, go out, and have relationships that do not include them. \n\nCaden is already in a disadvantageous spot, through no fault of his own. The stepsiblings have each other all the time; they already have the power to exclude him from activities within the house itself. I'm not saying they should be forced to include him against their will, but this is how the situation often ends up when there are two siblings on one side and one sibling on the other side of the marriage. You brother should \\*NOT\\* be granting the stepsiblings the power to then exclude him from having fun and relationships with other people. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs an additional... what do the step siblings even say about this? What have their SAID about their feelings? Because it might just be the case that their answer is \"What? We don't mind that Caden gets taken out and has a blast with Uncle OP? He should go out and have fun with that stuff, we just don't want to.\" \n\nIf this is the case, then Simone demanding that Caden not get to go if they don't want to might just make them feel guilty and  pressured, and breed resentment. It might be that they just don't want to play or interact with Caden, but NOT that they want to actively hurt him.", "NTA but I reckon Simone certainly is. Judging by the way her kids are behaving I wouldn't be surprised if she's actually coached them to exclude your nephew. Either way her logic makes no sense: they always decline your invitation.

Or both your brother and Simone failed to give the kids time to develop their own relationships with each other before the families were merged.\n2. While it would be so nice if the three kids saw themselves as siblings, it cannot be forced. I personally have doubts that Simone's kids will ever get there, but it will only be worse if they are forced to act as if they feel more than they do. That said, they do have to learn to treat Caleb with basic decency.\n3. On top of that, Simone has a really strange perspective on her kids and Caleb. From what you wrote, it's hard to get a gauge on how she views her kids' actions. But her perspective that her kids are the ones getting hurt because they don't want to go with Caleb is just whackadoodle. And to think the solution is to deny Caleb any fun, with the result that her kids can both continue to exclude him AND know that they made it impossible for him to have fun without them is just really wrong and dangerous to the future of this family.\n4. If your brother and Simone start with the counseling, they can address Simone's perspective that's so hurtful to Caleb and address what they can reasonably expect from Bella and Archie and how they can work together to develop that norm in the family. (Again, not forcing them to act out a closeness they don't feel, but to treat Caleb with basic decency.)\n5. Please keep being a safe and soft and loving place for Caleb. He really needs this.", "[removed]", "NTA. Don't give those two an extra way to annoy Caden.

The parents should stop Caden in his tracks too, the only thing they are doing is letting him hurt himself again and again, someone needs to sit down with him and teach him to navigate a situation like that.", "OP even if there are no fun trips, please continue visiting Caden.

You're a great aunt/uncle(?)!", "Welp that kid is going to need alllll the therapy and is going to resent the shit out of your brother. I wonder if he realizes how far he pushing his kid away. \n\nWatch for signs of depression, I'd even brush up on early signs in young kids. I'm not exaggerating either when I say this shit causes life-long psych issues. \n\nYour brother is fucking selfish as fuck btw. He's giving into his spouse with no obvious reasons so im betting he's just trying to keep ***his own*** peace and his kids expense. \n\nNTA, make his parents explain to him why the visits stop too if it comes to that. You shouldn't take the fall for them", "OP please pull your brother aside and tell him all of the observations you\u2019ve made, even if it doesn\u2019t come to this.

Please!!", "Agree. \nI'm glad mum is trying but also that she isn't forcing it.\n\nBut that doesn't change the fact that right now he's being excluded and OP is trying to give him some fun experiences to help navigate through the disappointment of being excluded. And OP and Caden are inviting the other kids to those experiences should they wish.", "Correct, but that doesn't make it okay for them to continue to treat him this way either.

I had an 11 year old cousin whos family thought the other kids in the family were all the friends she needed, but all the other \"kids\" in the family were boys 4+ years older than her that didn't want to spend their free times entertaining a little girl. \n\nMy brother and my cousin were playing N64 and she wanted to join in. Brother and cousin said no. She said \"Fine, I'll just go kill myself\" (a tactic she learned from her mother who used \"I'll just go kill myself\" to get her way). We don't think she actually meant to do it or understood exactly the consequences, but she went out back, tied the loose end of the clothesline around her neck and jumped off the picnic table. Clothesline stretches so she landed on the ground but was strangled to death.\n\n\nI know there's a billion \"what ifs\" on something like this, and hindsight is 20/20. But I never once saw her with a real friend. She just had appointed \"friends\" that didn't like her.", "What are the kids supposed to do?

Do they need to just suck it up??", "I'm reading a post with two parents who completely failed at creating a blended family, and should never have moved in together or gotten married when one set of children was so opposed to it.\n\nBecause of this bad decision by the parents, compounded by promising siblings to a kid who really wanted them, the whole thing is an ongoing dumpster fire where two kids living in the house want nothing to do with the third.  Unless I missed some huge section, nowhere in the post are the two kids doing anything besides . . . not playing with someone they don't want to play with.  \n\nThey're not hitting him.  They're not insulting him.  They're not yelling at him.  They're not saying anything bad about him.  They're removing themselves from a situation they don't want to be in, and that's their choice.  Are they being nice?  No, because their feelings and wishes have been consistently ignored.\n\nOP is NTA, the parents involved are.  At this point, the best thing is a lot of counseling, but it's probably never going to work out well.", "Which is the whole reason he's not sticking up for his son.
