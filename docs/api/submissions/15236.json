Caden's mom died when he was a baby. My brother married Simone 2 years ago almost and they blended families. Simone has Bella 10 and Archie 9. Bella and Archie's dad died when they were 4 and 5.\n\nCaden was really excited about Bella and Archie and having siblings. My brother and Simone told him that he'd have a brother and a sister and they'd be buddies for life and really made him eager to live with Bella and Archie. But his experience with them has not been a positive one. They don't want to include him in anything, they seem to go out of their way to not spend time with him. \n\nExamples I have witnessed and have been told about by Caden: Bella and Archie will be outside playing with kids in the neighborhood and when Caden tries to join in and play with everyone Bella and Archie will go inside or they will go do their own thing away from the other kids and Caden. Caden said sometimes Bella and Archie have said no to him joining and Simone will tell her kids they cannot stop him from playing with everyone else.\n\nI witnessed this myself at Christmas. Kids in my parents neighborhood were outside playing with their new toys and stuff. Caden joined a little after and Bell and Archie left the larger group playing together and went off on their own. When their mom noticed she went outside to say they should join the group again and they said no, because they didn't want to play with Caden.\n\nSometimes my brother or Simone will break up the kids into different groups for some fun family time and Caden is always told they don't want to do that stuff with him. When my brother takes them Bella or Archie will try to wander off, when Simone takes them they always try to put her in the middle of stuff so it's not like they are playing or having fun with Caden.\n\nSeveral months ago, when I realized how much it bothered Caden, and how sad it made him, we started doing a water park or trampoline park near us for the occasional fun day out. He'd ask to invite his stepsiblings and given they are my step niece and nephew, that made sense. The kids have never said yes. They have been offered and they will say they don't want to come. So I still take Caden. But now Simone is bothered by this. Last time we went Caden had such a good time and he said it was the most fun he'd ever had, because he got to stay late on the trampoline for helping another kid who was there. I guess Simone was bothered by him enjoying that so much when her kids weren't there. I told Simone the Bella and Archie have always been invited but they never come. She told me I shouldn't be taking Caden either then. My brother said maybe it's better to just lay off for now and not to bring Caden along.\n\nSimone wasn't just happy there though and told me to consider my actions because I was being deliberately hurtful to her children.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1681984901, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12staix/aita_for_taking_just_my_nephew_fun_places_and_not/", "score": 88, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

They have been married for almost 2 years and it sounds like they're doing nothing to resolve the core problem.", "NTA  \nWhile I can't speak for Simone's intentions, it really does come off as being jealous that her kids aren't able to enjoy themselves equally.  \nSimone needs to realize that her children are the ones who are hurting Caden and you just stuck up for him, not the other way round.  \nIn the end though your brother and Simone are the parents, the final decision lies with them.", "NTA\n\nThe kids have a standing offer of inclusion and are choosing not to go. Caden shouldn't miss out because the other kids don't want to go. Besides, none of the kids seem to have a problem with it, it's just the step-mother. She's trying way too hard to force the kids to get along and is, in the process, making the situation worse. She's already not listening to what her own kids want/need from her and her meddling is probably exacerbating things, and now she wants to take away some of the only good times Caden is having.\n\nI'm reasonably sure that her kids started out having a hard time accepting the whole blending of family due to their own issues, loss and grief, fear of letting people in and thus risking more loss and grief, having to share the one parent they still have left, etc. And clearly what they are currently doing isn't working. Maybe they should be trying some family therapy/counseling or something, but one thing they definitely shouldn't do is keep trying an already failed concept ad infinitum. And the step mother should DEFINITELY not take one of the only sources of happiness away from Caden, as that accomplishes nothing positive for anyone.\n\nThis whole situation is nuanced and difficult, but none of the problem is on you. You're just being a good uncle. Nothing you've done is wrong at any level.
