Caden's mom died when he was a baby. My brother married Simone 2 years ago almost and they blended families. Simone has Bella 10 and Archie 9. Bella and Archie's dad died when they were 4 and 5.\n\nCaden was really excited about Bella and Archie and having siblings. My brother and Simone told him that he'd have a brother and a sister and they'd be buddies for life and really made him eager to live with Bella and Archie. But his experience with them has not been a positive one. They don't want to include him in anything, they seem to go out of their way to not spend time with him. \n\nExamples I have witnessed and have been told about by Caden: Bella and Archie will be outside playing with kids in the neighborhood and when Caden tries to join in and play with everyone Bella and Archie will go inside or they will go do their own thing away from the other kids and Caden. Caden said sometimes Bella and Archie have said no to him joining and Simone will tell her kids they cannot stop him from playing with everyone else.\n\nI witnessed this myself at Christmas. Kids in my parents neighborhood were outside playing with their new toys and stuff. Caden joined a little after and Bell and Archie left the larger group playing together and went off on their own. When their mom noticed she went outside to say they should join the group again and they said no, because they didn't want to play with Caden.\n\nSometimes my brother or Simone will break up the kids into different groups for some fun family time and Caden is always told they don't want to do that stuff with him. When my brother takes them Bella or Archie will try to wander off, when Simone takes them they always try to put her in the middle of stuff so it's not like they are playing or having fun with Caden.\n\nSeveral months ago, when I realized how much it bothered Caden, and how sad it made him, we started doing a water park or trampoline park near us for the occasional fun day out. He'd ask to invite his stepsiblings and given they are my step niece and nephew, that made sense. The kids have never said yes. They have been offered and they will say they don't want to come. So I still take Caden. But now Simone is bothered by this. Last time we went Caden had such a good time and he said it was the most fun he'd ever had, because he got to stay late on the trampoline for helping another kid who was there. I guess Simone was bothered by him enjoying that so much when her kids weren't there. I told Simone the Bella and Archie have always been invited but they never come. She told me I shouldn't be taking Caden either then. My brother said maybe it's better to just lay off for now and not to bring Caden along.\n\nSimone wasn't just happy there though and told me to consider my actions because I was being deliberately hurtful to her children.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1681984901, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12staix/aita_for_taking_just_my_nephew_fun_places_and_not/", "score": 4429, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She's already not listening to what her own kids want/need from her and her meddling is probably exacerbating things, and now she wants to take away some of the only good times Caden is having.\n\nI'm reasonably sure that her kids started out having a hard time accepting the whole blending of family due to their own issues, loss and grief, fear of letting people in and thus risking more loss and grief, having to share the one parent they still have left, etc. And clearly what they are currently doing isn't working. Maybe they should be trying some family therapy/counseling or something, but one thing they definitely shouldn't do is keep trying an already failed concept ad infinitum. And the step mother should DEFINITELY not take one of the only sources of happiness away from Caden, as that accomplishes nothing positive for anyone.\n\nThis whole situation is nuanced and difficult, but none of the problem is on you.

Some key points to convey that:\r  \n\r  \nYou have Caden's best interests at heart. You want to give him opportunities to build positive memories, gain confidence in social situations and offset the disappointment of rejection from his stepsiblings. The occasional fun activities you plan with your nephew are meant to support him emotionally.\r  \n\r  \nBella and Archie have consistently chosen not to include Caden in their play or activities, despite repeated invitations and offers. Their behavior shows a lack of consideration for Caden's feelings, not yours. You cannot force them to spend time with Caden if they don't want to.\r  \n\r  \nSimone and your brother enabled Bella and Archie's exclusionary behavior instead of addressing it. They failed to set proper boundaries or consequences to promote inclusion and kindness. The blame lies with them, not you.\r  \n\r  \nYou did not deliberately hurt Bella and Archie. Invitations were extended but they were never taken up. Caden's joy at the activities had nothing to do with them or being deliberately spiteful. His happiness should not provoke guilt.\r  \n\r  \nBella and Archie's refusal to join occasional fun days out has nothing to do with you being hurtful. Their choices reflect their own unwillingness to build a closer bond with Caden, not any perceived attack on them. Do not let Simone manipulate you into thinking otherwise.\r  \n\r  \nYou have sought to promote a harmonious blended family environment for Caden's sake but cannot force relationships that are one-sided. Bella and Archie's neglect and rejection of their stepbrother is unjustified. Do not blame yourself for their poor behavior and coldheartedness.\r  \n\r  \nStay firm in your position. You have done nothing wrong by supporting your nephew and creating positive experiences for him. His stepsiblings and their parents need to do more to foster inclusiveness, not make him feel guilty for enjoying life. Do not hesitate to stand up for yourself if Simone continues to accuse you unjustly. You are fighting for what is right and in Caden's best interests.\r  \n\r  \nPlease let me know if you have any other questions or want further suggestions.

The mean kids don\u2019t want to go anyway. And why should they be rewarded for being mean? Maybe the little darlings will learn a thing or two.\n\nDon\u2019t change a thing. Tell them to back off.", "NTA - It might help to explain to your brother that if the stepsiblings were allowed to dictate whether Caden gets to go, that is deliberately hurtful to Caden. Why should their feelings be granted more importance than Caden's? That is what Simone is demanding - that Caden be brushed aside and her children be granted control over his ability to have fun, go out, and have relationships that do not include them. \n\nCaden is already in a disadvantageous spot, through no fault of his own. The stepsiblings have each other all the time; they already have the power to exclude him from activities within the house itself. I'm not saying they should be forced to include him against their will, but this is how the situation often ends up when there are two siblings on one side and one sibling on the other side of the marriage. You brother should \\*NOT\\* be granting the stepsiblings the power to then exclude him from having fun and relationships with other people. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs an additional... what do the step siblings even say about this? What have their SAID about their feelings? Because it might just be the case that their answer is \"What? We don't mind that Caden gets taken out and has a blast with Uncle OP? He should go out and have fun with that stuff, we just don't want to.\" \n\nIf this is the case, then Simone demanding that Caden not get to go if they don't want to might just make them feel guilty and  pressured, and breed resentment. It might be that they just don't want to play or interact with Caden, but NOT that they want to actively hurt him.", "NTA but I reckon Simone certainly is. Judging by the way her kids are behaving I wouldn't be surprised if she's actually coached them to exclude your nephew. Either way her logic makes no sense: they always decline your invitation.

It may prompt him to consider pursuing some family counseling.\n\n1. It seems your brother did a great job of preparing Caleb for blending two families, and Caleb was open to this. It's possible Simone did not do a great job of preparing her kids; it's possible she tried, but they just were not open. Maybe because they had each other or because they were old enough to remember when they were a family of four. Or both your brother and Simone failed to give the kids time to develop their own relationships with each other before the families were merged.\n2. While it would be so nice if the three kids saw themselves as siblings, it cannot be forced. I personally have doubts that Simone's kids will ever get there, but it will only be worse if they are forced to act as if they feel more than they do. That said, they do have to learn to treat Caleb with basic decency.\n3. On top of that, Simone has a really strange perspective on her kids and Caleb. From what you wrote, it's hard to get a gauge on how she views her kids' actions. But her perspective that her kids are the ones getting hurt because they don't want to go with Caleb is just whackadoodle. And to think the solution is to deny Caleb any fun, with the result that her kids can both continue to exclude him AND know that they made it impossible for him to have fun without them is just really wrong and dangerous to the future of this family.\n4. If your brother and Simone start with the counseling, they can address Simone's perspective that's so hurtful to Caleb and address what they can reasonably expect from Bella and Archie and how they can work together to develop that norm in the family.

Caden is lonely and unhappy in his own house BECAUSE of them, why should you worry about their feelings?", "I was poised to answer y - t - a based on the headline, but once I read the full post, 100% NTA. Caden is being excluded, made to feel less than, unwanted, and so you're taking him out so he can have some time where he's made to feel special.

And do keep inviting Bella and Archie, even if they keep saying no. Then when Simone says something again, here is what you say: \n\n\"Simone, Bella and Archie are the ones being deliberately hurtful to a child by bullying and excluding Caden. Since they are kids, I've been willing to look past that which is why Caden and I continue to invite them every time. But it's been harder to look past the fact that you, their parent, haven't stepped in to stop the bullying and exclusion and tell them it's wrong. Now you want to reinforce their cruel behavior by having them see the one thing Caden gets to do that makes him feel wanted taken away from him, just because they aren't interested in going to? Well that I can't look past, there is no logic to your demand, and I can't even see any other way to interpret that than you being deliberately hurtful to Caden for no good reason. I am going to continue to take Caden out because it is extremely important to his emotional well-being to have some time where he feels wanted. And Caden and I are going to continue to invite Bella and Archie in the hope that our example of showing kindness to someone even when they aren't being kind to you will eventually influence Bella and Archie for the better, despite their mother not teaching them kindness.\"", "NTA you invited the other two, they declined.

That is the exact way you push a kid away in this situation. Clearly they are catering to the kids and while they address it, it continues to happen and if Caden isn't already consciously aware of it, being forced to have a relationship with someone who clearly doesn't want anything to do with you is a recipie for disaster, depression, social stunting and the like. \n\nAn 18 year old kid posted here the other day about how his dad remarried and the one son took to step mom and couldn't understnad why his 18 year old brother had issues with her. She pushed to hard and tried to force the issues and always took younger brother's side. When 18 yo son was able, he moved on from them and when he tried to explain how the parent's actions messed with him, they couldn't even admit that they went to far. \n\nSometimes these things just don't work and punishing Caden but making him miss fun events simply because his step siblings, who have never wanted him included, didn't go.

Refuse to give up time with your nephew. If you can, maybe explain to your nephew why he's probably being rejected by his step-siblings. Odds are it has nothing to do with him and everything to do with them not wanting any kind of new family.\n\nBut they don't get to pick and choose. They don't get to reject your offers and then be sad about it. If you're feeling generous - maybe keep the invites coming anyway.
