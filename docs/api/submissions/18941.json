So I would set that aside and just figure out how to proceed.  1) information diet. She finds out info only when you are disseminating it to the whole world. 2) decide your boundaries in advance, have husband communicate them, and don\u2019t change that at all.

She seems okay with that.  NTA.  As long as she thinks her actions were okay I wouldn't have anything to do with her.  Of course, her plan is for that to drive a wedge between you and your husband so you might want to direct future actions/discussions toward him instead of her but that's your call.

Never ever give in to your MIL or allow your husband to brush off your feelings. It will ruin your marriage because they will always assume you overreact and your feelings are insignificant. That said, you also should not perpetuate negative feelings once you expressed them. It will make your miserable.\n\nMy advice (fwiw): Arrange a meeting with your MIL (have your husband there) and express your feelings. Explain exactly what she did and how it affected you. Ask for an apology, but be specific. \"I want you to understand how I felt when you did this and apologize for hurting /insulting me.\" or whatever you want the apology to be for. Write a script if you have to.

Unless grandma will dictate when you get pregnant, what position you will use to get pregnant, how often you will get pregnant, the sex of each baby, the number of babies, the names of each baby, etc....\n\nUnless you are letting mil run your life, then her being a possible future grandmother doesn't  complicate anything at all.", "She's not the one giving birth( if that's something soon congratulations\ud83d\udc76\ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83c\udf7c\ud83e\udd31) you would be that's your baby and you get 100 % say in who gets to be in that baby's life.

Well unless he's completely blind he knows what his mother is like and maybe just maybe you're the key in helping him break free and break whatever control problem she has . I'm sorry I know what it's like to get talked into a wedding you didn't envision .

I would be utterly ropable.\n\nUnfortunately, I doubt you\u2019re going to get an apology. That doesn\u2019t mean that you can\u2019t lay down some consequences though. Tell your husband that you want some new boundaries - maybe you spend less time with her around Christmas/holidays, maybe you revoke her spare key, maybe she needs to visit less. Make it clear that while an apology will help clear the air, it will not change these boundaries, because you know it\u2019s the consequences that forced her hand, not genuine remorse. Then follow through.   \n\nIf anyone accuses you of being petty, remind them that she disrespected you and broke your trust, so you simply had to reevaluate to protect your peace.", "Oh come on.
