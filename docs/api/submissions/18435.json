I apologized, reminded her I love her like a mother, and explained to her that Mom arranged the party and we did not mean to hurt any feelings.

This went well, we picked one (mostly) together.\nIn Oct, A asked when we should start dress shopping. I told her I already had a dress I picked out. I went with my MOH before she left to study abroad, my mom, and sister a month earlier. I didn't invite A because she asked me not to tell her about things I wasn't involving her in, and I would have had to pick between A and my mom.

You were simply abiding by A's wishes and requests. She should never have assumed that you would pick her over your very alive loving mother to go dress shopping with as that is a mother/daughter event especially when from the sounds of it your mum and A do not get on at all.\n\nTell your dad so long for now until you (he) realise that you're (him) the one who is in the wrong and the AH. But unfortunately I think that that'll be a long time.\n\nMake it clear to his side of the family what has and is happening. That you've not had any affairs and never will.\n\nAny messages that you've got from dad and A about the wedding and wedding planning screenshot them, especially if you use the messenger app like I do, so they don't delete them. Then, show them to the family members and friends who may well be siding with your dad. Post it as a public Facebook post, explain that you want your dad (and A, so you look like an even more reasonable person) at your wedding and to walk you down the aisle, post the screenshots of messages etc, but also say that if your dad and A still feel the way they do (complete and utter drama queen AH's imo) you feel like having NC for a while for your own sake if this is the case with your dad still, so as to avoid any further confrontations and drama occurring. That you know that a fb post may not be seen by some as the best course if action but doing it that way means that it is all out in the open and no one twisting things in private for their own pleasure. All comments regarding the post and what is/had happened/ing should be on the post and not in private communications with you.\n\nMany on here will not agree with my recommendation but from experience with my own family after my mum died and issues at her funeral when family members completely disregarded my wishes and even physically attacked me, putting a fb post explaining my side and all of the screenshots helped as people realised what they'd done wrong and how I had been really struggling and had put on a brave face with a permagrin that I'd mastered at all of my jobs up until that point. Also, the public forum and stating that any conversations regarding the post and what I'd said had to be on that post meant that any drama was public from them and wouldnt gwt as out of hand as private commun as it meant wveryone had to think carefully about what they said. It meant that they couldn't completely blow up and berate me or guilt trip me into giving in and apologising TO THEM  for my being wrong. \nHope that that helps you in some way and I hop that you have a wonderful and peaceful wedding regardless of unreasonable people in your life. \ud83e\udd1e\ud83c\udffb\u270c\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc70\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83e\udd35\u200d\u2642\ufe0f", "NTA.. what your father is doing to you is abuse.

Good for you since I know it\u2019s not easy.", "NTA. If your dad and A wanted to throw you an engagement party, they could have organized their own with dad's side of the family.

Especially since it pointedly includes only one side of the family.\n\nAs for the dress shopping, A told you she doesn't want to be involved in anything including your mom.

She knows your venue & probably still has the contact info of who you met with.\n\nAlso make it clear they are not expected or welcome at the wedding in case they decide to crash it last minute (or is their plan & just RSVPed no to set you up). Hiring security for both the service & reception might be a wise investment. These people have show they have no boundaries or shame.", "NTA. WTF. Shit like this is why some people choose to elope.", "What a great time to go no contact with your not-father (since he's not doing any actual fathering). I hope your wedding goes wonderfully and wish you the best with your soon to be husband.", "I would of cut him off when he gave back my ornaments", "Your steomom sounds immature and emotionally manipulative abd your father sounds controling. Setting rules for YOUR wedding? Sheesh. \n\nAlso, it's weird that your stepmom expected to be invited to the party your mom threw for you. Stepmother and dad could have thrown a party filor you for their side of the family. Abd denanding that he abd your step mom are the ones who give yiu away, ridiculous. \n\nMy parents are divotlrced abd married to other people. I set up my wedding in a way that involved all four of them. My father and mother did the verbal \"we give her away\" thing. My mom and step mom lit the unity candles for us. I honestly don't remember what my stepdad did, but I know we included him.\n\nIt honestly sounds like a good thing that your father and step mom won't be there.", "I can't imagine why your Mom divorced him! /s NTA.", "INFO: What exactly is the background between your mom, dad, and A here that they seem to barely be able to even be in the same room?", "What's the story behind the divorce? You say you love your SM but you were completely okay with your mom not inviting your other parent and his partner to one of the wedding functions? \n\nWith the limited information I see here, I can't help but say ESH.\n\nYour mother and SM for not loving you enough to set aside their enemity. Your father for giving you rules. You for going nuclear about not involving your SM and going nuclear with her when she was obviously hurt that you don't think of her as your mother when you stated in the story that you do love her like one. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nLet the downvotes begin. \n\nOh and I do think your mom will finally be happy. Now she has all of you for the rest of your life. Certain things/events/reactions/actions can forever change a relationship. The actions of every one involved so far has already done that. It will never be the same again. And that's just sad.", "INFO: Who is paying for the wedding? Sadly I think that gives Dad a bit more leg to stand on, if he is footing the bill.  \nA sounds completely irrational to think she should be on equal footing with your mother. OP NTA, but A is.", "YTA to yourself, you've been catering to your stepmom all your life, maybe it's finally time to stop, and to respect yourself and your fiancee. I'm guessing he isn't too happy about all the loops your going through for someone who doesn't respect you", ">Your dad and stepmom are only interested on having you in their lives on their terms, even when it comes to your wedding day.\n\nThis is the crux of it, right here. Dad and stepmom are huge AHs for trying to get OP to exclude her biomom from the wedding. And from the sound of things, they've been guilting OP her whole life and she's finally had enough. Hopefully skipping the wedding because *it's not all about them* is the wake-up call to carve these toxic people out of OP's life. \n\nThat final accusation, that OP is cheating on her fiance, is galling. That alone is cause to go NC.", "I am glad someone else peeped that, celebrating Father\u2019s Day indeed, I didn\u2019t even know what stepmonster -oops- step Mom even wanted. I know no one wants to hear this but if he doesn\u2019t go to the wedding he will regret it forever. NTA.", "[removed]", "Of course she is delusional, everyone has been enabling her. Even OP says she loves her like her mom. Ofc she's gonna act like the toxic mom if everyone is ok with it.", "Yeesh. If they want total control of a wedding so badly, they should throw a vow-renewal ceremony. \nOP NTA, and dad and A sound super toxic. They are both pandering to each other and enabling the others' entitled, narcissistic behaviour. A great match for each other, by the sounds of it, but also, you are better off enforcing your boundaries.", "Right?? I mean, there are so many red flags with dad and A's behaviour and they really are expecting OP to roll over and obey. \nI also wish OP hadn't even bothered to check about the RSVP. Let the tr*sh take itself out and hopefully now OP can go ahead and enjoy her wedding, free of drama and gaslighting.", "\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25 this!!! I see waaaaay too many adult children on this sub who are still pandering to their controlling, narcissistic parents.", "I'd be wary about giving this advice. I don't know where in the world OP is getting married, but UK law says that people can't be barred from entering the ceremony. Absolutely bar them from the reception and have people briefed if they decide to try and disrupt the ceremony though. \n\n(Asking if anybody knows 'any due cause and impediment' to the marriage is a legal requirement. By barring people from the ceremony, celebrants risk not complying with the law).", "Only narcissist vibes? They seem like waves to be honest! Who goes around setting rules for someone else\u2019s wedding?! NTA.", "Utterly, completely exhausting. OMG, I cannot even imagine OP's childhood...... ridiculousness.", "For real! I choked on my water when I read that! \"OH, OP isn't acknowledging our main character-ness, let's make sure the family thinks she's trash by lying and calling her a cheater!\" \n\nOP, NTA.

So effectively the mum is allowed no involvement whatsoever in her daughter's wedding, to placate the crazy stepparent, when she seems to be the same supportive parent...", "I think most of it is coming from the stepmother, but that might be OP\u2019s own biased view. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if these two have been around each other and stepmom got aggressive or started acting rude towards OP\u2019s mom. That\u2019s just my theory but that\u2019s true vibe I picked up from this story. I mean, it\u2019s clear as day that her father and stepmom are insanely controlling and entitled, maybe her fathers behaviour is part of the reason her bio parents are no longer together.", "I'm wondering if Dad cheated on OP's mom with what's her face before they got divorced.", "I didn\u2019t know that. It sounds rather archaic and like an invitation for estranged family members to show up and falsely accuse you of cheating on your fianc\u00e9 on the most important day of your life. What happens if someone objects? Can the ceremony still move forward?", "And why specifically his dick??", "Agreed. Like this is mind blowing.", "Waves... It's a full on bloody musical. With way too much bass and every singer thinking they're the star of the show.", "Agreed! It\u2019s like sirens going off with the red flags.", "I can\u2019t either.

The intention to marry also has to be made public beforehand (either by banns being read in church or by details being posted in the local registry office) so that anyone has a justified concern can raise that before the day of the wedding.", "More cowbell!", "I've been a stepmother for 30 years to kids who have a mom. Having a close relationship with them, sharing in their lives as a mother, is a *gift*, not a requirement. I never expect any of it.
