I apologized, reminded her I love her like a mother, and explained to her that Mom arranged the party and we did not mean to hurt any feelings.

This went well, we picked one (mostly) together.\nIn Oct, A asked when we should start dress shopping. I told her I already had a dress I picked out. I went with my MOH before she left to study abroad, my mom, and sister a month earlier. I didn't invite A because she asked me not to tell her about things I wasn't involving her in, and I would have had to pick between A and my mom.

Dad gave me all my childhood Christmas ornaments. I apparently wasn't invited back.\n\nA week later my dad asked me apologize to A for not inviting her to go dress shopping.

You were simply abiding by A's wishes and requests. She should never have assumed that you would pick her over your very alive loving mother to go dress shopping with as that is a mother/daughter event especially when from the sounds of it your mum and A do not get on at all.\n\nTell your dad so long for now until you (he) realise that you're (him) the one who is in the wrong and the AH. But unfortunately I think that that'll be a long time.\n\nMake it clear to his side of the family what has and is happening. That you've not had any affairs and never will.\n\nAny messages that you've got from dad and A about the wedding and wedding planning screenshot them, especially if you use the messenger app like I do, so they don't delete them. Then, show them to the family members and friends who may well be siding with your dad. Post it as a public Facebook post, explain that you want your dad (and A, so you look like an even more reasonable person) at your wedding and to walk you down the aisle, post the screenshots of messages etc, but also say that if your dad and A still feel the way they do (complete and utter drama queen AH's imo) you feel like having NC for a while for your own sake if this is the case with your dad still, so as to avoid any further confrontations and drama occurring. That you know that a fb post may not be seen by some as the best course if action but doing it that way means that it is all out in the open and no one twisting things in private for their own pleasure. All comments regarding the post and what is/had happened/ing should be on the post and not in private communications with you.\n\nMany on here will not agree with my recommendation but from experience with my own family after my mum died and issues at her funeral when family members completely disregarded my wishes and even physically attacked me, putting a fb post explaining my side and all of the screenshots helped as people realised what they'd done wrong and how I had been really struggling and had put on a brave face with a permagrin that I'd mastered at all of my jobs up until that point. Also, the public forum and stating that any conversations regarding the post and what I'd said had to be on that post meant that any drama was public from them and wouldnt gwt as out of hand as private commun as it meant wveryone had to think carefully about what they said. It meant that they couldn't completely blow up and berate me or guilt trip me into giving in and apologising TO THEM  for my being wrong. \nHope that that helps you in some way and I hop that you have a wonderful and peaceful wedding regardless of unreasonable people in your life. \ud83e\udd1e\ud83c\udffb\u270c\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc70\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83e\udd35\u200d\u2642\ufe0f", "NTA.. what your father is doing to you is abuse.

Good for you since I know it\u2019s not easy.", "NTA. If your dad and A wanted to throw you an engagement party, they could have organized their own with dad's side of the family.

Especially since it pointedly includes only one side of the family.\n\nAs for the dress shopping, A told you she doesn't want to be involved in anything including your mom. Did your stepmother expect you to completely throw your mom out of your wedding preparations? That is more than unreasonable. She could have talked with you about which part of the wedding falls under her and which under your mom. But that would necessitate talking about your mom which she refuses.

I\u2019m assuming it\u2019s not an isolated incident, either, because something that horrid doesn\u2019t fall out of a person\u2019s mouth that easily if it\u2019s not a habit. All the wedding drama is obviously awful, but you would\u2019ve been fully justified in cutting her out of your life the moment you turned 18.\n\nI\u2019m so sorry that your dad and your stepmom are so shitty, but I strongly suspect you\u2019d be better off without them at this point.", "You can do what my husband and I did, we walked with each other down the aisle. I didn\u2019t want to pick between any of my parents and the aisle wasn\u2019t wide enough for all four of them and me \ud83d\ude04.", "That one deserves a nice little \u201cwe will consult with our legal representative to explore our options\u201d response.", "YTA cause after your dad accused you of cheating you still asked for RSVP", "Absolutely and completely NTA. Those rules are ridiculous and totally fail to take you into account and the fact that its your wedding. You said you asked A about being involved and A reassured you she didn't need to be involved in everything. You let A help pick your venue, and you tried so hard to include A. Even if A has no other children, she still doesn't have a right to treat you this way and if your father and A seem to be at odds with your mother than surely A can't expect to be involved in everything. I'm so sorry that your Dad has chosen to miss your wedding over this, but it's definitely not your fault and I hope your loved ones make up for it on the day and that you have an incredible wedding."]}
