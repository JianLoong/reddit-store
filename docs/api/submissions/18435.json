A was upset about being left out of the celebration and not being treated equal to Mom. I apologized, reminded her I love her like a mother, and explained to her that Mom arranged the party and we did not mean to hurt any feelings.

She said she was.\n\nAfter this, I kept A involved in the things I wanted her to be a part of. I cant involve Mom and A in the same things at the same time. The venue would be A's thing. This went well, we picked one (mostly) together.\nIn Oct, A asked when we should start dress shopping. I told her I already had a dress I picked out. I went with my MOH before she left to study abroad, my mom, and sister a month earlier. I didn't invite A because she asked me not to tell her about things I wasn't involving her in, and I would have had to pick between A and my mom. So I picked my mom.\nA sent me a message saying she couldn't be involved in the wedding anymore because it was too hurtful. I apologized.\nI visited again in Jan. and didnt speak to A. Dad gave me all my childhood Christmas ornaments. I apparently wasn't invited back.\n\nA week later my dad asked me apologize to A for not inviting her to go dress shopping.

You were simply abiding by A's wishes and requests. She should never have assumed that you would pick her over your very alive loving mother to go dress shopping with as that is a mother/daughter event especially when from the sounds of it your mum and A do not get on at all.\n\nTell your dad so long for now until you (he) realise that you're (him) the one who is in the wrong and the AH. But unfortunately I think that that'll be a long time.\n\nMake it clear to his side of the family what has and is happening. That you've not had any affairs and never will.\n\nAny messages that you've got from dad and A about the wedding and wedding planning screenshot them, especially if you use the messenger app like I do, so they don't delete them. Then, show them to the family members and friends who may well be siding with your dad. Post it as a public Facebook post, explain that you want your dad (and A, so you look like an even more reasonable person) at your wedding and to walk you down the aisle, post the screenshots of messages etc, but also say that if your dad and A still feel the way they do (complete and utter drama queen AH's imo) you feel like having NC for a while for your own sake if this is the case with your dad still, so as to avoid any further confrontations and drama occurring. That you know that a fb post may not be seen by some as the best course if action but doing it that way means that it is all out in the open and no one twisting things in private for their own pleasure. All comments regarding the post and what is/had happened/ing should be on the post and not in private communications with you.\n\nMany on here will not agree with my recommendation but from experience with my own family after my mum died and issues at her funeral when family members completely disregarded my wishes and even physically attacked me, putting a fb post explaining my side and all of the screenshots helped as people realised what they'd done wrong and how I had been really struggling and had put on a brave face with a permagrin that I'd mastered at all of my jobs up until that point. Also, the public forum and stating that any conversations regarding the post and what I'd said had to be on that post meant that any drama was public from them and wouldnt gwt as out of hand as private commun as it meant wveryone had to think carefully about what they said. It meant that they couldn't completely blow up and berate me or guilt trip me into giving in and apologising TO THEM  for my being wrong. \nHope that that helps you in some way and I hop that you have a wonderful and peaceful wedding regardless of unreasonable people in your life. \ud83e\udd1e\ud83c\udffb\u270c\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc70\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83e\udd35\u200d\u2642\ufe0f", "NTA.. what your father is doing to you is abuse.

Good for you since I know it\u2019s not easy.", "NTA. If your dad and A wanted to throw you an engagement party, they could have organized their own with dad's side of the family. That would have been reasonable and a nice thing to do. Expecting to be invited to the one your mom organized, when they can barely stand her, is not. Especially since it pointedly includes only one side of the family.\n\nAs for the dress shopping, A told you she doesn't want to be involved in anything including your mom. Did your stepmother expect you to completely throw your mom out of your wedding preparations? That is more than unreasonable. She could have talked with you about which part of the wedding falls under her and which under your mom. But that would necessitate talking about your mom which she refuses. What were you supposed to do exactly?\n\nThis is your wedding, not a d\\*ck measuring contest against your mom (Sorry for the wording but that was the most fitting term I could think of for their crap). If they can't behave like adults, they can sit it out. The fact that they slandered you behind your back the moment you told them a strict no, tells you everything you need to know about them and their respect for you.\n\nI'm sorry you had to deal with them your whole life OP. It all sounds soul-deep exhausting. I hope you have a lovely wedding! And don't let them get you down! <3", "Nta. I hate to hear about situations like this. My husband's ex became my best friend and I loved her (she has passed now). When our kids were little, we would all take vacations together, the kids thought it was normal and we had to explain to them that we couldn't  \"all get a big house and everyone live together\". Her and I would gang up on my husband and he regretted being born a few times.", "NTA - A sounds like an absolute child let them not be involved next time you see them you can tell your dad how much he fucked up and refuse to tell A anything because she \"can't handle it\" fucking hell", "Honestly that sounds like a happy ending to me.  NTA.", "Your father and stepmother spread a false rumour about you, their daughter? Wtf sort of bizarre toxic.childiah behaviour is that. OP you're NTA, these people sound toxic.", "NTA. Your dad and A are being absolutely ridiculous.", "NTA. Dad and A dont deserve to be in the event. Ask your stepfather to give you away, that way your dad and A wont attend the wedding. He doesn't care about your wedding at all, he only care about him and A feeling and to be above everyone else. And he rather hurt you and your mom so he can pampered A.", "You're lucky he's not going.  I'd go extremely lc with them.  It's clear A wants to take over your wedding.  She's sounds exhausting. \n\nNTA", "NTA. There is only this much narcissistic behavior one can handle - could barely finish reading.", "NTA", "^ this. Your dad and stepmom sound exhausting. I\u2019m getting narcissist vibes from them. I know that gets thrown around a lot but in this case the red flags are blatant. You were right to stand up to them OP. I also hope you have an amazing wedding day free of toxic people in your life. NTA.", "Especially when it sounds like A refuse to attend any event OP\u2019s mother attends.  What is OP suppose to do kick her mother, the host out of the party?", "It\u2019s sad these two moms can\u2019t put aside their anger for a child they both say they live. My dad and stepmom threw me an engagement party and my mom was absolutely there! I went dress shopping with both of them together. They do not like each other at all, but they dealt with it and made no drama.", "Perhaps dear old dad has a roving eye and is trying to shift \"everyones\" attention to OP because they've gotten just a little suspicious lately?", "I\u2019m shocked OP still has any contact with her parents after they made up rumors about her cheating on her fianc\u00e9. Not to mention everything else here. Dad is pathetic, stepmom is a lunatic.", "Typical manipulation, they know this but is perfect to make her feel shamed and bad about it as she was responsible.\n\nShame and blame are very Powellfull tools\n\nEdit: misspelling in typical", "Just curious because I have been in a similar, though less dramatic situation, is Stepmom the reason or part of the reason your parents got divorced in the first place? Oh, and most definitely NTA!", "It was a setup.\n\nA wants to be chased by OP (and apparently everyone).  If she was invited to the party, she would have been mad.  Excluded, mad.  Unless she sees literally everyone bowing to her, she has \u201clost\u201d the game.", "Given that dad insisted that he and A would be the ones giving OP away in the declaration I would ve inclined to agree with you and also be shocked if dad never encouraged it.\n\nNTA OP. Stand your ground and have an amazing day. Oh and as for your dads demand of beingbthe only one walking you down tge aisle I would have told him I was walking by myself"]}
