My mom decided to host an engagement party and invite her side of the family (her and Dad are divorced).\nLater, Dad and stepmom(A) asked to speak with my fiance and I. A was upset about being left out of the celebration and not being treated equal to Mom. I apologized, reminded her I love her like a mother, and explained to her that Mom arranged the party and we did not mean to hurt any feelings. A said if there is any chance of that happening again, to PLEASE not involve her in the first place. I asked her if she was SURE. She said she was.\n\nAfter this, I kept A involved in the things I wanted her to be a part of. I cant involve Mom and A in the same things at the same time. The venue would be A's thing. This went well, we picked one (mostly) together.\nIn Oct, A asked when we should start dress shopping. I told her I already had a dress I picked out. I went with my MOH before she left to study abroad, my mom, and sister a month earlier. I didn't invite A because she asked me not to tell her about things I wasn't involving her in, and I would have had to pick between A and my mom. So I picked my mom.\nA sent me a message saying she couldn't be involved in the wedding anymore because it was too hurtful. I apologized.\nI visited again in Jan. and didnt speak to A. Dad gave me all my childhood Christmas ornaments. I apparently wasn't invited back.\n\nA week later my dad asked me apologize to A for not inviting her to go dress shopping. I told him I have been the one making peace and apologizing since I was a CHILD. It is a pattern for A to blow things out of proportion and not take accountability for it. This is the first time that I have decided not to be the peacemaker, and left it to Dad and A to fix things. After I made it clear I wasn't going to apologize, Dad said, \"I don't even want to go to your wedding because of this\" Ouch. \n\nA month later, Dad asked us to meet and talk. I insisted we needed a counselor present so my side would be acknowledged. \nBefore meeting, he set 8 rules I had to follow for him to be in the ceremony:\n1i can't treat A the way I've been treating her\n2A will be at the wedding to support Dad\n3 it will only be the 2 of us walking down the aisle\n4mom and stepdad will NOT be up in the ceremony at the same time as Dad.\n5I must seat Dad away from Mom \n6dad will not include Mom in anything. If asked \"who gives away this bride\", he'll respond, \"A and I do.\"\n7If I do not treat A with respect, Dad and A will leave as soon as the ceremony is over.\n8If I do not abide by these expectations, Dad will walk out during the ceremony\nI told him I won't be following his rules for MY WEDDING so I understand if he chooses not to be a part of the ceremony. \nMy aunt and cousin told me later that at Christmas Dad and A told everyone I was cheating on my fiance before he proposed. This statement is completely fictional. \n\nYesterday I asked Dad for his RSVP.\nHe said he booked a vacation instead to celebrate Father's Day.", "created_utc": 1685336981, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13uljzr/aita_for_not_making_peace_after_leaving_my/", "score": 147, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

They're acting like high school idiots. \n\nI've been in this situation OP with my grandparents. It went on for 40 YEARS until me and my two brothers stood up to them for my older brothers wedding.

You\u2019ve been very patient with them. \n\nI hope your wedding goes well and you have a blast.", "You OP are NTA!!!! A real father doesn't set those kinds of rules for his daughter's wedding!!!! You were simply abiding by A's wishes and requests. She should never have assumed that you would pick her over your very alive loving mother to go dress shopping with as that is a mother/daughter event especially when from the sounds of it your mum and A do not get on at all.\n\nTell your dad so long for now until you (he) realise that you're (him) the one who is in the wrong and the AH. But unfortunately I think that that'll be a long time.\n\nMake it clear to his side of the family what has and is happening. That you've not had any affairs and never will.\n\nAny messages that you've got from dad and A about the wedding and wedding planning screenshot them, especially if you use the messenger app like I do, so they don't delete them. Then, show them to the family members and friends who may well be siding with your dad. Post it as a public Facebook post, explain that you want your dad (and A, so you look like an even more reasonable person) at your wedding and to walk you down the aisle, post the screenshots of messages etc, but also say that if your dad and A still feel the way they do (complete and utter drama queen AH's imo) you feel like having NC for a while for your own sake if this is the case with your dad still, so as to avoid any further confrontations and drama occurring. That you know that a fb post may not be seen by some as the best course if action but doing it that way means that it is all out in the open and no one twisting things in private for their own pleasure. All comments regarding the post and what is/had happened/ing should be on the post and not in private communications with you.\n\nMany on here will not agree with my recommendation but from experience with my own family after my mum died and issues at her funeral when family members completely disregarded my wishes and even physically attacked me, putting a fb post explaining my side and all of the screenshots helped as people realised what they'd done wrong and how I had been really struggling and had put on a brave face with a permagrin that I'd mastered at all of my jobs up until that point. Also, the public forum and stating that any conversations regarding the post and what I'd said had to be on that post meant that any drama was public from them and wouldnt gwt as out of hand as private commun as it meant wveryone had to think carefully about what they said. It meant that they couldn't completely blow up and berate me or guilt trip me into giving in and apologising TO THEM  for my being wrong. \nHope that that helps you in some way and I hop that you have a wonderful and peaceful wedding regardless of unreasonable people in your life. \ud83e\udd1e\ud83c\udffb\u270c\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc70\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83e\udd35\u200d\u2642\ufe0f", "NTA.. what your father is doing to you is abuse. This is your big day, he is making it about him and his wife.. and putting you in the middle. I would ignore all this - picking who can be where and when. Just invite everyone and they decide if they come or not. Im sure these \u201cadults\u201d can be in the same room for a bit for your big day. I am super petty so I would probably un-invite my dad and have my stepdad walk me down the aisle", "Can't help but wonder if stepmom couldn't have kids, so she wanted OP to fill the void of being unable to have her own daughter. She's acting like she's the mother of the bride.", "??? Why reference Nixon?", "OP never said that her *mom* was the one who refused to be around the stepmom. All that she was said was, \u201cI can\u2019t involve Mom and A in the same things at the same time.\u201d This may have actually been the stepmom\u2019s rule, or a rule OP imposed herself, instead of OP\u2019s mom being petty. Judging by the stepmom\u2019s other behavior, I\u2019m inclined to think that she\u2019s actually the culprit behind the separate events."]}
