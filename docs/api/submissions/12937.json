Financially I am better off then him and it truly doesn't bother me until it directly affects me. It could be argued that I'm greedy, honestly. I was used for money by everyone (friends, family, fianc\u00e9s family) for years so now I'm extra greedy with my money and I honestly refuse to loan money to anyone anymore. I'm out thousands. But for the most part, helping my fianc\u00e9 out truly doesn't bother me. I love him, he's a great guy and his work is his passion so I understand him not going elsewhere (wish I loved my job like he does). So that's just a bit of backstory of why I did this today.\n\nSo basically I give my fianc\u00e9 money sometimes. Play money or even like bill money (if he needs new clothes or shoes for work I enjoy giving him the money for it because I like spoiling HIM). He gets nice things and I'm financially able to do this and God does it make me feel good. I love it. But again, I don't want my money going to anyone else. Well today he was meeting up with his mom and grandmother and afterwards he was going out to buy a suit because he landed a BIG gig. I sent him with $400 and told him to get the suit he wanted, which was $340. It is important to note too that he does absolutely try paying me back when I give him money but to be blunt, he doesn't get enough money to pay me back. So I send him with the money, he leaves. \n\nWell he just called me and asked me if I would send him $160. I asked if he had found a better suit that he liked more and he informed me that he hadn't but he no longer had the money for the suit because his mom and gram wanted to go out to eat for seafood and he treated them to the meal. I asked why he would spend my money on them (I don't get along with either of them and I've already cut them off financially years ago). He said he felt like he had to, as they kept manipulating him (\"we really want seafood, too bad we can't afford it\", \"we haven't had seafood in so long\", \"I wish someone would just give us seafood\" etc etc). I told him no. That he would have to find a cheaper alternative. It's not my fault he chose to use my money to provide them with a meal when it was supposed to be for his suit. My best friend, who is here, says I'm an AH because she knows what it's like being backed in to a corner by family and he probably didn't want to spend that money on them but it's hard saying no when you're backed against a wall.

He could have found alternate clothing (new slacks and a thrift store or borrowed jacket, for instance) at a far cheaper price.  \n\nYou don't get wealthier by spending $300+ on a suit or $200 on seafood dinner.  My husband and I have more money than your fiance.  We've spent more than $200 on dinner less than 5 times in our entire lives (and it was always for 4 or more people) and the only suit my husband spent more than $300 on was the one he wore for our wedding.

And he isn't learning to be financially independent.\n\nPlease do him a favor and explain that he needs to learn to do better with the money he earns before the two of you can be married.", "NTA but you would be if you marry him", "NTA, but be careful he doesn't find ways to lie to you about where your money is going to please his mommy and grandma.", "NTA.  \n\n\nDude doesn't NEED anything. There's no issue with you treating him- but he doesn't need anything. Treating his family to a meal with money he doesn't have that he got gifted from you is a huge breach in trust IMO.", "NTA, but you\u2019re making blatant excuses for your fianc\u00e9. \ud83d\udea9", "NTA. \n\nHis family is. Point blank", "NTA. Have you guys talked about finances?", "NTA He has to learn to set boundaries with them at some point. Btw, I would hardly call you greedy with your money.", "NTA. You are the sugar mom. Everyone is using you as the cash machine. You don't have an equal in the lot. While I get that it feels good to give, you are robbing your SO of any incentive to grow and be more self sufficient. Right now, you are keeping him as an older teenager, or a pet. What happens if you can no longer make great money? Can he step up to cover your expenses? \n\nI wouldn't want a partner that is completely dependent on me and my wellbeing. I suggest sitting down and figuring out why you like this very unbalanced relationship. What are you getting from it, really? What is he? Why do you need him to be dependent on you? 'Cause if you didn't feel that way, it wouldn't be so unbalanced and he wouldn't be taking you for granted.", "NTA. Seems like he isn\u2019t financially literate yet. \n\nGetting married is one of the biggest financial decisions of your life. Before that happens y\u2019all need to talk about finances\u2014 separate or joined? Maybe only having a joint account for bills? But you should also have a plan in place for if he takes that money to spend unwisely (whether it\u2019s malicious to get back at you or if it\u2019s unintentional from his family). Also have the discussion of if he plans to take care of those family members later in life. These can be hard topics to talk about but it\u2019s better to be honest and upfront before tying the knot!", "[deleted]", "Or he thought\n\nAh well, op will just top it up.\n\nNTA op", "Not your problem if fianc\u00e9e doesn\u2019t have a backbone. Next time he\u2019s meeting with them I\u2019d NOT send him with $. Are you sure that marrying someone who doesn\u2019t care about how he spent the $ that was for his suit? Seems like you\u2019d be arguing not only about $ often, money is one of the biggest reasons for divorce, but more that he can\u2019t stand up for himself and he\u2019ll be giving away your $ to others. He knew that were manipulative but still didn\u2019t walk away or say no.", "NTA He should have told he didn't have the money to take them out.  The money was for another purpose.", "NTA. Your boyfriend needs to grow a spine and show you some respect. His family are trashy.", "NTA, but I would think long and hard about marrying someone who isn\u2019t able to support himself.", "Back in the day, lol! My mother would send me shopping for school clothes with a letter & store credit card number. The store would issue a temp card with the limit stated (like $400 ;) ), and I could spend up to the stated limit. I wonder if you could set up something similar for future clothing purchases made by fiance, so he could do his shopping, but not spend his funds on magic beans, or seafood lunches - BTW, I am in NE and that's freaking a huge lunch bill! 3 lobster rolls would be under $100, so they totally bumped that puppy up high!", "NTA. Your friend is wrong. He allowed himself be pressure, that\u2019s on him. But he did it presuming you\u2019d come up with the extra. It\u2019s good to hold this boundary. He should have said no, or else should have understood it meant buying a cheaper suit.", "Absolutely NTA and it sounds like you and your fiance need to have a serious talk about whatever fuckery he's allowing to happen because roughly what 220 dollars?  on seafood is ridiculous especially when he knew he wanted that suit for a big job he was going for.  No, he sounds either like a pushover blabbermouth (obviously telling his family he had money in one way or another) or he's seeing you as a bank much like the rest.  You are in no way greedy either for protecting yourself from leeches.", "> He used SUIT money \n\nNTA\n\nHow many jobs today require a \"good\" suit?\n\nIs he applying for a job as an executive in a bank?\n\nA nice shirt and a sports coat should suffice.", "Assuming that part of that is a tip of at least 15%, the actual cost of the meal would have been $190, which is still pretty expensive for 3 people. If he tipped more, the meals go down to more reasonable prices, but he's still being generous with OP's money.", "Maybe he told them he was shopping after lunch, they asked how could he afford it, he told them OP gave him money", "Way to be a debbie downer. OP said she loves him, doesn't mind sharing money with him, and he never called her greedy - that was OP's own description. You are just looking for any excuse to shit on someone.", "\"Oh, I just have to run some errands.\" \n\nVs\n\n\"Oh, I have to buy a suit.\"\n\"A suit?? Those are expensive!\"\n\"Yes but I have enough to buy the one I want.\"\n\"That's nice, can we go have some lunch and catch up more? It's been forever since I've had seafood!\"\n\nDo you see the difference? He should have shut it down immediately, but he knew he had the Magic Purse, where it refills no matter what he spends.", "Why are you with this fianc\u00e9?", "YWBTA to yourself if you keep financially supporting this loser. He's clearly using you. He really used your money to bring his mom and grandma out to eat? When is the last time he treated you to a fancy meal? And don't say he \"tries to pay you back\"\nIf he actually wanted to pay you back, he would. If he truly loved you and saw a future with you he'd be working a second or third job so he could take some of the financial strain and stress off of you. \nThis boy doesn't even like you.", "So he is an adult snd needs to learn how to say no. You\u2019ve learned.  Why can\u2019t he.  All he did was take the easy way out assuming you would not say no to him.  \n\nThat something is difficult, isn\u2019t a reason to let manipulators win.\n\nIf he learns you won\u2019t make up that money, next time he\u2019ll say no.  When was the last time they did anything for him or you?", "NTA you gave him money to buy himself a suit he chose to spend it on something else. It\u2019s up to him to figure it out. I would also be asked to be paid back the money that didn\u2019t go towards the suit.", "It's not has a hard to say no if you have a spine. You have 1. He needs to grow 1. NTA", "No NTA.\n\nYou gave him money specifically for a suit. It is his own fault that he spent what he needed on them.\n\nYou sound more like an ATM than a fianc\u00e9.", "Just to be very very clear.  You are not greedy with your money, you are responsible - big difference.   You are under no obligation to fund the lifestyle of anyone else.  \n\nIt would probably be a good idea to have some financial counselling as a couple prior to marriage, as it sounds like you both have quite different attitudes to money.\n\nNTA", "Omg I just realized this is a FIANC\u00c9E and not even just a boyfriend. Why would you marry this dude? He can't even take care of himself. You can't be this desperate.", "Why isn't he getting a second or third job so he can start providing?", "NTA.\nIt's wonderful that you set up financial boundaries. When/if you get married to fiance, you need to be on the same page about not lending out money. \n\nI know how destructive family can get when they get involved in your personal finances. Perhaps your fiance was raised to think he has a duty or responsibility to help them financially. He should go to therapy for that.\n\nIn the meantime, make it very clear that you will not bank roll anybody other than who you want.", "NTA but this needs to stop- he is behaving no differently than all the people who have taken advantage of you in the past.", "nta and dont give him money for a suit again ...you already gave him the money he chose not to buy a suit with it", "NTA I have always had the rule of I have to give money to a man I am dating, I don't give him money and I don't date him.", "NTA, however your fianc\u00e9's handling of the situation does raise red flags for the future.", "You need to surround yourself with better people. These losers are all taking advantage of you and you deserve better. NTA and he is pretty free with your money. Stop the gravy train now.", "YTA because you're obviously enjoying being the victim when loaning money which is never repaid. Wiser people than me have said, neither a borrower or a lender be. You like the money because it gives you a sense of control which makes you TAH. Use some of your wealth for some therapy to help you understand why money is your method of control. What he did wasn't right but what you did in giving the money with strings is worse. Sweetie, you don't have a boyfriend, you have a gigolo that doesn't understand the position for which he has been hired.", "It's reasonable...you're okay with him mooching off you ..it's ok to have a boundary when it comes to his family. NTA", "NTA financially abusive men are an epidemic this generation. You are not greedy for setting boundaries, and reinforcing those boundaries would only demonstrate self-respect.\n\nJust thinking ahead: If your boyfriend threatens to leave you or says this changed how he feels about you, then you know why he was really around.", ">My best friend, who is here, says I'm an AH because she knows what it's like being backed in to a corner by family and he probably didn't want to spend that money on them but it's hard saying no when you're backed against a wall.\n\nYeah. Sorry, but part of growing up is learning to say \"no\" even if its uncomfortable. His inability to say No should not become OPs problem.", "You are also treating him like a child by not making figure out his own responsibility", "This dude makes no money & spends $200 of your money for one meal on two ppl that treat you like shit, then wants more $$ from you? Uh, no.", "NTA\n\nSpreading the wealth to his family without pre-approval would be a deal breaker for me as well.", "NTA hopefully it will help him learn that if hes given money for a specific purpose, then wastes it on other stuff, he can't then get what he intended to spend money on.", "NTA.    \nAnd of course it's hard to say no to these people. They understand that and take advantage of that fact.  That's why people put on their big boy pants, grow a spine, and say no to them.   Your fiance needs to start doing that before he loses you for good.  I would never in a million years allow someone to manipulate/guilt me into giving them money like that especially when it's not even my money.", "1. PRENUP\n\n2. Why are you cool with him getting to something he likes for work, while you don\u2019t?\n\n3. If you\u2019re taking bets on how long before he\u2019s unemployed; my guess is 1 month after the marriage. His mom-wife (you) will take care of all his needs, why work?", "Because mom-fianc\u00e9 provides everything he needs! Why on earth would he work?!", "NTA without a doubt. Everone here already explained why that is, so I won't repeat the same points here.\nHowever, I wanted to say that even though you call yourself greedy with your money, I don't see that at ALL. On the contrary, you have been so generous that people took advantage of you and you are still out 1000s of dollars. And even after being used like that, you still love giving money to your partner to help him out or just get him some nice things. I don't know a single greedy person that does that! \nNo darling, you are not greedy at all, you are just protecting yourself and being smart. Keep doing what you are doing. You don't owe anybody anything!", "NTA for the situation, but the way you talk about your boyfriend\u2019s paycheck irks me.", "Did\u2014 did he spend $220 on lunch????", "Nta.  Put ur foot down and keep your money u earn it", "NTA\nHes got a nerve to spend your money on them.\nEven bigger balls to ask you for more after spending it on parasites. \nHe really deserves a month in the sin bin or given the flick permanently. \nYou sound like a fantastic lady.", "Also need to include local sales tax on the suit. Hard to calculate exactly but an extra 7% on 340 is 363, let's just use 365 for maths sake;\n\nIf the restaurant also has to charge sales for service tax, then you also have to account for it there. So it comes out closer to 160, which is a lot but more imaginable. If they are in a high cost of living city, that might be pretty normal even.", "There are many and we shouldn't presume without more information. For example, all the men I know have at least one good suit for weddings and funerals, and some still wear the suit no tie uniform for corporate jobs, and many hospitality jobs require suits.", "So his family all live off the state and he lives off of his sugar mama (you). The difference between him and his family that you hate because of their financial ways is what?"]}
