IVF and the like can cost 160k+ in the USA. While we do not know what treatments were used, none of them are cheap. \n\nThere is no reason that a third party needs to be involved in these expenses.

They probably felt it was so unlikely that they would conceive, the idea of multiples didn\u2019t seem serious. Of course multiples are more common with IVF but that doesn\u2019t make it easier to imagine, especially when you\u2019re doing so much just for the (still small) chance of having one.

That could be hand-me-downs, food, babysitting, housework, anything.

I\u2019ll come over for a couple of hours and help with them during social visits because I want to meet and play with the kids; or I\u2019ll come over and do one chore like laundry, but nothing else. If that\u2019s not good enough and you\u2019re turning that offer down then we\u2019ll go back to the default where I don\u2019t do anything. Let me know when you\u2019re ready to stop insulting me over my offer to help.\u201d\n\nTo everyone else who hassles you: \u201cI\u2019m glad to know you\u2019re keen to volunteer your time to look after their babies, but you\u2019ll have to discuss what time you\u2019re giving with my sister and her husband, because I\u2019m not involved.\u201d Send that sort of reply, exactly copy pasted each time with no variation, to every mention of it. Make the drama boring for them. If they don\u2019t stop after three or five repetitions, cut to the chase. \u201cI\u2019ve been clear that I won\u2019t discuss this. I am going to block this number for a couple of months to give you time to calm down and get used to the situation.\u201d And then do it! Deprive them of their outlet so they are forced to move on.\n\nUltimately this problem is not your problem. It *would* build a stronger community relationship if you joined in; and if you are in need in future, people will remember how you were about this and will not come to your assistance because your problems won\u2019t be their problems. If you\u2019re happy to lie in the bed you\u2019re making should the worst happen and you be the one in need, that\u2019s absolutely fine. Plenty of people don\u2019t build those networks by choice, or are asked to put effort in to those networks but are aware they\u2019ve never been given any support in return and so stop buying in. It\u2019s up to you how you want those relationships to work and enforcing your boundaries now will reset them very sharply, but there\u2019s going to be a hell of a pressure burst in response to it.", "NTA. Your sister chose to have children, and multiples at that. The children are her and her husband\u2019s responsibility, no one else\u2019s. Anyone who helps them is doing them a huge favor and they should be extremely grateful and appreciative. They are not entitled to your help, especially when you have your own life and your own shit you have to deal with.

They can mind their own business and fuck off.", "I assume she did IVF in which case why *the hell* did she transfer more than 1 or 2 embryos. It is unusual to transfer more than 1 now because of a higher success rate so unless she ended up with identical triplets or quads then this could have been avoided...\n\nNTA\n\nThough as a mum of twins i will say after the first 6 months the babies get a lot easier, good luck to her", "ESH - i know its aita so it'll be not the assholes because \"they aren't entitled to anything\" but your sister begged for help with her family - which is also your family- and you said no. \n\nYeah they could have planned and not relied on family but also thats what family is for. You are sometimes asked to make sacrifices and you do because while it's worse for you as an individual, its better for your family as a whole. \n\nHopefully you are an individual who always thinks things through and always has a great plan and never needs help. Because I doubt if you ask now it'll come.", "NTA. It was generous of you do even offer to do something, and they are ungrateful.", "NTA what you're offering sounds reasonable and completely normal. I think THEY don't want to help either, and if they could get you to do more, they can do less.", "You are not an asshole in this situation. There are several reasons why:\r  \n\r  \nYou want to support your sister and new nieces/nephews but feel overwhelmed by the demands being placed on you and reluctant to give up your life and finances to help care for them, especially given the uncertainty of their health and recovery. This is a reasonable perspective.\r  \n\r  \nCaring for infant multiples is an enormous responsibility that requires round-the-clock care and resources. It is unreasonable and unsustainable to rely on volunteers and handouts, and will likely require professional help. This is not your responsibility to shoulder alone.\r  \n\r  \nYour sister chose to continue with the high-risk pregnancy despite medical advice and their situation. While the babies' existence is wonderful, that does not obligate you or others to sacrifice for an indefinite period to support their poor decision-making.\r  \n\r  \nYou offered a reasonable level of support by helping out for a limited time, doing chores, or watching for a couple of hours. But do not feel able or responsible to commit fully to caring for the babies, especially without knowing about health issues. This is support without being life-changing.\r  \n\r  \nYour own life, finances, relationships, health, etc. also matter. You do not owe it to anyone to give up everything for their needs and demands, even if they are family. That is unrealistic and will only lead to resentment.\r  \n\r  \nThere are other family members and friends also willing to help, as well as potential government assistance. The responsibility should not fall entirely on you.\r  \n\r  \nYour sister and BIL are understandably stressed but lashing out at you as \"selfish\" or \"horrible\" is unjustified. Emotions are high but that does not make their accusations fair or reasonable.\r  \n\r  \nYou want to support them but not at the cost of your well-being. That is completely reasonable. While this is an emotional situation, you cannot set yourself on fire to keep others warm. I think if you continue to communicate this perspective to your sister and others, set clear boundaries around what you can contribute, and stand up for yourself if accused of not doing enough, you would not be in the wrong.\r  \n\r  \nThe choice is ultimately up to you, but I hope this provides perspective to determine the approach you want to take. Please let me know if you have any other questions or concerns. I'm here to provide support without judgment.", "its simple. People love to say they will help but when them times comes very few actually show up. You should do just as them.

He doesn't need more guilt-trips from strangers on the internet who will not be required to contribute.\n\nWhen entitled AHs demand time and money from others saying \"it takes a village to raise a child\", what they're ignoring is that other people get to *choose* whether they are part of the village.

They should have thought about that before they had the doctors implant so many embryos. \n\nOP is young and has his own life to make for himself.
