IVF and the like can cost 160k+ in the USA. While we do not know what treatments were used, none of them are cheap. \n\nThere is no reason that a third party needs to be involved in these expenses. Some people cannot have children, this is just a fact of life. While asking for help is well and good when you realise you are struggling, because at this point you should be trying to do your best for the babies, there should not be an expectation that any individual not involved in the decision process should be burdened with this commitment. \n\nThis is where the poster finds themselves. They have no obligation to assist the couple. Whether that be time, money, or other assets.

They probably felt it was so unlikely that they would conceive, the idea of multiples didn\u2019t seem serious. Of course multiples are more common with IVF but that doesn\u2019t make it easier to imagine, especially when you\u2019re doing so much just for the (still small) chance of having one. So I also wouldn\u2019t be harsh on them for that outcome.\n\nYou\u2019re confusing asking for help from your family and community and feeling entitled to monetary gifts. Not the same thing. It\u2019s normal and a good thing to ask for help when you need it. You just need to be gracious when it\u2019s denied. \n\nAlso I\u2019m not sure what your cultural background is but in many, many cultures it\u2019s just normal for families to gather around and offer as much support as possible whenever anyone has a baby. That could be hand-me-downs, food, babysitting, housework, anything.

I hope it gets better for you, dude.", "NTA... let them know how you can help and if they are snarky, dont bother. \nThis situation was completely premeditated, and now they learn to cope", "NTA. This was their choice, not yours. They have plenty of people offering more time. You have offered what you can offer. It\u2019s not on you to give more than you have.", "And they chose to have multiples\u2026. Yes it was a choice, which endangered the mother and the babies.", "This. Not just chose to have a kid but chose multiples. Pregnancies like this are heavily monitored at the beginning and most doctors will offer selective abortion to get the mother down to twins or a single embryo. \n\nIts crazy they kept so many.", "Given how they are struggling, you would think they would be thrilled at any assistance being offered to them right now. Not rejecting it because it\u2019s\u2026not enough free labor being done on their behalf?", "No, we do not like in a kinship culture. They would be my nieces/nephews and are not considered my children. I have never been asked to provide money or support for the children of my other siblings aside from occasionally watching them for a short time. Nothing close to what my sister and her husband want.", "For privacy I will only say more than twins.\n\nNone of the babies died. They all survived being born and are still living.", "English is not my mother language. My most humble apologies that I got a word wrong.", ">remember that one day the tables may be turned, and you may be the one needing their help.\n\nWhen I had cancer my sister and her husband never once offered to help, or came to visit me in the hospital. They didn't offer help when our father got hurt at his job and needed rides to rehabilitation or when our grandmother had a stroke. So I'm not counting on their help in the future.", "They are demanding more then what you say and for much longer. At least the next three years my sister says.", "This changes the point of their comment zero percent", "A responsible doctor would've only implanted a couple at a time. It's crazy he allowed this woman to take such a risk with her history.", "This sounds like it may be a high order multiple situation.  Think...Octomom.", "Then I'll go with NTA, but maybe you can find something you can offer that is the most helpful  with an acceptable amount of effort on your part.", "Then you have your answer. The tables did turned. And if that information it is clear that your sister and her husband are not good people. They just want to take, never give.", "And I feel its heartless to boot. What a sad comment.", "And Octomom has left the building.", "How many are \"multiple\" babies?\n\nNTA either way because you weren't consulted when they decided to ignore drs advice, then find a Dr who would go against other medical opinions and give them what they wanted for a price. They made those decisions they need to accept the consequences of those decisions. They can ask for help, but they can not demand help. They also need to learn how to care for however many children they have on their own. It is called being a parent and accepting responsibility for your actions.", "How many? Please tell us.", "I was thinking the same. People should absolutely not have children unless they are financially stable enough for it. I know that\u2019s a harsh opinion, but I think anything else is irresponsible and selfish", "High risk pregnancies take more out of a woman and take longer to recover from. That\u2019s a fact. While a normal birth might see a woman back to approximate normality in 6-8 weeks it could be 12-16 weeks for such a tough pregnancy. It\u2019s OKAY for people to ask for help under these circumstances. Many other people have handled multiple kids fine - when they\u2019re in good health. She\u2019ll get there eventually. Preemies also need extra care and it\u2019s OKAY to ask for help until they get caught up and can get on a maintenance schedule. \n\n\u201cNo man is an island entire of itself; every man \nis a piece of the continent, a part of the main;\u201d Insisting people do it all by themselves in times of need sounds like the absolute worst of the red side.", "NTA - you've offered some assistance and they have rejected that offer. Sounds like they are r/ChoosingBeggars", "Nta", "How many kids are we talking here? I'm curious. But no you are NTA for not wanting to be a part of the baby army. How long are they expecting ppl to help? Until the kids can walk and talk? Until they graduate school? Eventually they are going to have to do it themselves. I understand a bit of help at first but rotating shifts and expecting money is a whole different level. NTA", "NTA your sister decided to take all of her multiple births to term. They can care for them. If they can't that's not your responsibility.", "NTA.  When we met with a fertility specialist, she said she wouldn\u2019t even let us trigger and wanted us to abstain if more than two eggs, maybe three matured.  It sounds like their doctor took risks he shouldn\u2019t have.  Even then, I believe there is an option to lessen how many fetuses you carry if you carry too many.  So it sounds like they CHOSE this and they shouldn\u2019t have expectations of anyone else \u2014 they should be grateful for whatever help is offered!", "Nah. You are not responsible for your sister or her children. This is one of those things were most families will come together to help though - so your family thinking you would as well it's not unreasonable. You have the right to your own boundaries - but they will be upset. So don't be surprised if they aren't there to support you in the future.", "OP if they accuse you of being selfish look them in the eye and firmly say \u2018I don\u2019t care\u2019 NTA", "NTA, you didn't ask your sister to have your nieces and nephews. Your sister and her husband did.  If you cave now they will not stop with the constant demanding", "Tell them to start their own Go Fund Me page.", "NTA. Seriously, their children are no one\u2019s problem but their own. Did you get a vote in their pregnancy? No. So why would you have any responsibility for it. Frankly, why should the taxpayer? They have no money, mother has no job, and they thought it was a good idea to go through with a procedure that is weellll known for resulting in multiples? People like that are so rage inducing, a true argument against welfare. Frankly, those kids should just go up for adoption if they can\u2019t care for them. It\u2019s not your problem.", "NTA.  It sounds like they don't appreciate what you're doing, so you should be doing less, not more.\n\nThese children are their choice, full stop.", "NTA. They wanted children. They take care of them. You should not be facing the consequences of their own actions.", "NTA. These are things one has to think of when planning a family.

Not you pig not your farm!", "NTA, not your kids = not your problem.", "NTA, But!\n\nI just cannot comprehend this, your describing it as torture, it's taking care of your nieces/nephews! (This would be paradise for me, I love kids tho) This is what family is for, it's our support group.\nI don't think you're an AH, you just don't want to do something you don't like to do, but I'd just remember that since family is for helping each other, and you're not helping, why would they ever help you? Unconditional love does not exist, even if it did, it would be unhealthy for any relationship.\n\nLife isn't always about doing what we enjoy 100% of the time, we make sacrifices for things that are worth it, like a family, a family is with it imo...", "Twins are multiples. Triplets or quadruplets are a ton more work, I would imagine. Still NTA.", "I think this is very culturally dependent. In America and likely most of the Western hemisphere, you\u2019re NTA for choosing to help only to the extent you are comfortable. If you and your family are from a distinctly different culture then you may be viewed as the AH if families are expected to come together and be a \u201cvillage\u201d as you say. I\u2019m not saying that\u2019s right or preferred, but having mostly Americans answer your post may not reflect how your actual community may feel if you\u2019re community is one that have an all-for-one-and-one-for-all mentality.", "NTA - not your children mit your problem. If they can\u2018t take care of them they should have thought about it before they went through with multiples", "NTA", "NTA.

If I had someone offer to do laundry postpartum for an hour I'd be pretty excited lol. One hour is still kind", "They are purposefully taking advantage of people do not cave into their demands keep setting boundaries.", "They're not saying how many for privacy reasons. They said more than twins, but I'm guessing more than triplets. Most multiple births that are more than triplets make headlines and it would be easy to find out their identity", "Still you can't get angry if people refuse to give you consistent help for whatever reason they're given to you. OP sister should be grateful even only for one free hour of help that she's offering", "They are not his responsibility at all. Family or not. They knew for 9 months they needed to prepare for a baby. Hell, they probably found out at the 5th month mark how many kids they were having. \n\nThey already have an army of people helping. By the sounds of it at least a dozen. That should be enough. They shouldn't feel entilted to ops time just because they are family. OP owes them nothing. NTA", "THIS", "If this is IVF, they tend to implant multiple embryos to maximize the chance of one working.\n\nAnd then if more than one manages to survive, with the current legislation in America, they might not be able to abort even if they did want to. \n\nIt's an awful situation to be in, but unfortunately they can't change that. Considering the desperate situation they are in, while OP is not obliged to help in anyway, I do think there is a moral duty to help in some way.\n\n[s]  I understand I don't know the nuance of the situation, but personally I wouldn't be able to leave my sister without help in this situation. ]OP spending three hours batchcooking a load of soup once a week, or spending that time looking after the babies so her sister could sleep would probably be a godsend at this point. [/s] Corrected below, shouldn't post pre coffee. Thanks!", "Pp I was like: one hour is freaking long. Someone who works in this hour for me for free - welcome!\n\nMy dad cooked a few times for us and it was like heaven. I cried every single time.", "Oh. That makes sense.", "Wow are they major entitled AHs. When other family members, yourself included, need support they\u2019re nowhere to be found but when they need help you\u2019re expected to completely rearrange your life for them for years to come.

Thank you, I'll correct above.", "Im assuming its 5+ and they dont want to say it because its such a rare thing that someone could identify his sister with the info.  Dont know why they wouldnt just say it if it was a more common amount.", "It\u2019s absolutely OK to ask for help. It is not OK to demand help and berate people for not helping enough.", "Note that I said can, not should. Therefore, I agree he does not \"need\" to do anything, and he would still be NTA.

You can figure it out really fast. It's less than 5.", "It is fairly obvious given the post that OP does not take part in a culture where that is the norm. If that's how you chose to live cool, clearly that is not how OP has chosen to live and therefore suggesting that OP take any responsibility for other peoples kids is ridiculous", "I suggested no such thing. I suggested he voluntarily identify  some way he feels he would be willing to contribute through his own thoughtful consideration. I acknowledged he is not in a culture where familial child rearing responsibility extends to him when I posted NTA. But we can certainly also discuss how people can do more than is required, find meaning in service, and consider more than the stated parameters. It sounds like you're very against OP doing any extra effort, even if he decides to do so through his own consideration, which sounds very antithetical to any and every social contract humans live under. None of that, or the statements you're reacting to, suggest he 'take responsibility.'"]}
