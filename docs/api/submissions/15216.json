Since people do give away these things, it\u2019s normal for new parents to ask if anyone can pass things on to them.

IVF and the like can cost 160k+ in the USA. While we do not know what treatments were used, none of them are cheap. \n\nThere is no reason that a third party needs to be involved in these expenses. Some people cannot have children, this is just a fact of life. While asking for help is well and good when you realise you are struggling, because at this point you should be trying to do your best for the babies, there should not be an expectation that any individual not involved in the decision process should be burdened with this commitment. \n\nThis is where the poster finds themselves. They have no obligation to assist the couple. Whether that be time, money, or other assets.

They probably felt it was so unlikely that they would conceive, the idea of multiples didn\u2019t seem serious. Of course multiples are more common with IVF but that doesn\u2019t make it easier to imagine, especially when you\u2019re doing so much just for the (still small) chance of having one. So I also wouldn\u2019t be harsh on them for that outcome.\n\nYou\u2019re confusing asking for help from your family and community and feeling entitled to monetary gifts. Not the same thing. It\u2019s normal and a good thing to ask for help when you need it. You just need to be gracious when it\u2019s denied. \n\nAlso I\u2019m not sure what your cultural background is but in many, many cultures it\u2019s just normal for families to gather around and offer as much support as possible whenever anyone has a baby. That could be hand-me-downs, food, babysitting, housework, anything.

But THEIR desire to have a baby was not YOUR desire.  You are a grown man.  Do NOT allow yourself to be backed into a corner into helping out with those kids/that situation if you don't want to or can't.  Offer to do ONLY what YOU want to do.  I hope it gets better for you, dude.", "NTA... let them know how you can help and if they are snarky, dont bother. \nThis situation was completely premeditated, and now they learn to cope", "NTA. This was their choice, not yours. They have plenty of people offering more time. You have offered what you can offer. It\u2019s not on you to give more than you have.", "And they chose to have multiples\u2026. Yes it was a choice, which endangered the mother and the babies.", "This. Not just chose to have a kid but chose multiples. Pregnancies like this are heavily monitored at the beginning and most doctors will offer selective abortion to get the mother down to twins or a single embryo. \n\nIts crazy they kept so many.", "Given how they are struggling, you would think they would be thrilled at any assistance being offered to them right now. Not rejecting it because it\u2019s\u2026not enough free labor being done on their behalf?", "No, we do not like in a kinship culture. They would be my nieces/nephews and are not considered my children. I have never been asked to provide money or support for the children of my other siblings aside from occasionally watching them for a short time. Nothing close to what my sister and her husband want.", "For privacy I will only say more than twins.\n\nNone of the babies died. They all survived being born and are still living.", "English is not my mother language. My most humble apologies that I got a word wrong.", ">remember that one day the tables may be turned, and you may be the one needing their help.\n\nWhen I had cancer my sister and her husband never once offered to help, or came to visit me in the hospital. They didn't offer help when our father got hurt at his job and needed rides to rehabilitation or when our grandmother had a stroke. So I'm not counting on their help in the future.", "They are demanding more then what you say and for much longer. At least the next three years my sister says.", "This changes the point of their comment zero percent", "A responsible doctor would've only implanted a couple at a time. It's crazy he allowed this woman to take such a risk with her history.", "This sounds like it may be a high order multiple situation.  Think...Octomom.", "Then I'll go with NTA, but maybe you can find something you can offer that is the most helpful  with an acceptable amount of effort on your part.", "Then you have your answer. The tables did turned. And if that information it is clear that your sister and her husband are not good people. They just want to take, never give.", "And I feel its heartless to boot. What a sad comment.", "And Octomom has left the building.", "How many are \"multiple\" babies?\n\nNTA either way because you weren't consulted when they decided to ignore drs advice, then find a Dr who would go against other medical opinions and give them what they wanted for a price. They made those decisions they need to accept the consequences of those decisions. They can ask for help, but they can not demand help. They also need to learn how to care for however many children they have on their own. It is called being a parent and accepting responsibility for your actions.", "How many? Please tell us.", "I was thinking the same. People should absolutely not have children unless they are financially stable enough for it. I know that\u2019s a harsh opinion, but I think anything else is irresponsible and selfish", "High risk pregnancies take more out of a woman and take longer to recover from. That\u2019s a fact. While a normal birth might see a woman back to approximate normality in 6-8 weeks it could be 12-16 weeks for such a tough pregnancy. It\u2019s OKAY for people to ask for help under these circumstances. Many other people have handled multiple kids fine - when they\u2019re in good health. She\u2019ll get there eventually. Preemies also need extra care and it\u2019s OKAY to ask for help until they get caught up and can get on a maintenance schedule. \n\n\u201cNo man is an island entire of itself; every man \nis a piece of the continent, a part of the main;\u201d Insisting people do it all by themselves in times of need sounds like the absolute worst of the red side."]}
