She is clearly trying to be in control of her daughter and probably believes that she can still do what she wants with her even though she\u2019s your wife now. She has lost all trust in you over the little miscommunication with the cigarettes, which she was in the wrong for as well. The fact that she told your whole family about the issue and how she was apparently going to willingly drag her 31 year old daughter back to her country is horrific. Don\u2019t pay for her cab fare either \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f if she can\u2019t get it I would just leave her on the street. She is depriving you of family bonding time and stressing out the new mother, which \n in time can cause her breast milk to lessen up. She needs to get a grip, go home, and apologize to your face before she does leave. I would make sure she apologized to your family as well.

She is mad that she can't browbeat you and you don't back down, so she thinks threatening to take your wife back w her will work.   Your wife is still hormonal so talk with her, love her, take care of her and baby.
