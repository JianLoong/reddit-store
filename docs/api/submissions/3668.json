Well, it's often misused by people like your in-laws. The actual, full saying goes: \"The blood of the covenant is thicker than the water of the womb\". That is to say - your true family are the people who are there for you, who have chosen to treat you as family should. That \"blood of the covenant\", that choice, is thicker, is more real and much more important, than \"the water of the womb\", those initial biological ties.\n\nYou clearly know what the true meaning of family is, and your husband's parents should be grateful for that. I'm really glad to hear your husband is standing by you and your family! And I'm sorry that his parents keep dismissing your true family with those nasty remarks. They clearly haven't gotten the messege if they're still trying to make you feel bad for speaking up about how this hurts you. If they do feel guilty, good, they should. They need to seriously reflect on what they think family is, and why they feel the need to constantly dismiss yours, even when it hurts their relationship with you and their son. They don't understand what it means to choose to be a family. It seems like you and your husband do, I'm sure you'll have a wonderful family and that you'll always remember the amazing feeling of having your actual dad, the one who chose to live as your dad, walk you down the aisle.", "NTA, how wonderful that you had a dad to love you and take care of you and your siblings when your bio parents were not able to. This is a very lucky situation that doesn't happen often and you should be able to celebrate it with your family and loved ones instead of being made to feel bad or having to defend yourself or your dad. Your husband's parents don't seem like great people so maybe you can cut ties and if you and your husband are ok then he and your future kids can keep a very basic relationship with them (if your husband's parents can be civil). Please remember this: you don't have to suffer just because you married their son.", "Nta clearly", "NTA. You should be proud that you stood up for yourself and your family.
