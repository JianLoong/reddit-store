Well, it's often misused by people like your in-laws. The actual, full saying goes: \"The blood of the covenant is thicker than the water of the womb\". That is to say - your true family are the people who are there for you, who have chosen to treat you as family should. That \"blood of the covenant\", that choice, is thicker, is more real and much more important, than \"the water of the womb\", those initial biological ties.\n\nYou clearly know what the true meaning of family is, and your husband's parents should be grateful for that. I'm really glad to hear your husband is standing by you and your family! And I'm sorry that his parents keep dismissing your true family with those nasty remarks. They clearly haven't gotten the messege if they're still trying to make you feel bad for speaking up about how this hurts you. If they do feel guilty, good, they should. They need to seriously reflect on what they think family is, and why they feel the need to constantly dismiss yours, even when it hurts their relationship with you and their son. They don't understand what it means to choose to be a family. It seems like you and your husband do, I'm sure you'll have a wonderful family and that you'll always remember the amazing feeling of having your actual dad, the one who chose to live as your dad, walk you down the aisle.", "NTA, how wonderful that you had a dad to love you and take care of you and your siblings when your bio parents were not able to. This is a very lucky situation that doesn't happen often and you should be able to celebrate it with your family and loved ones instead of being made to feel bad or having to defend yourself or your dad. Your husband's parents don't seem like great people so maybe you can cut ties and if you and your husband are ok then he and your future kids can keep a very basic relationship with them (if your husband's parents can be civil). Please remember this: you don't have to suffer just because you married their son.", "Nta clearly", "NTA. You should be proud that you stood up for yourself and your family.

Not your fault!", "NTA because your \"real\" father was the man that adopted you and your brother to raise you as his own along with his own. They were cruel and foolish to think you didn't have a \"real\" parent just because the man that raised you and loved you like a father loves his daughter happened to not produce the sperm that fertilized the egg that became you.\n\nYou didn't make them feel anything. They saw the rude and foul creatures they were being in the mirror you finally held before them and they **hated** it. They felt guilty because *there was something to feel guilty over.*", "NTA.  And why should they not feel like shit?  They bought those feelings and paid for them.  Keep your boundaries.", "What you said was perfect. \n\nI was adopted by my mom's second husband. He was \"Dad\" from the day they married to the day he died. I have zero tolerance for people who want to be needlessly cruel and nosey in these situations and you absolutely do not need to tolerate their uneducated, boorish comments. \n\nI hope they've learned their lesson. If they haven't I wouldn't hesitate to call them out in just the same way again. They need to hear it.\n\nNTA.", "The only person that can make you feel bad is youri, because you let others or influences make you think that way.\n\nI won't get into details but i have loved ones that aren't blood but family regardless and i love them as much as anyone could possibly love another. \n\nI would stick up for them too if someone pushed me about it and have. Some people are just ignorant", "Nta", "NTA. I love it when people judge situations that they have no knowledge over, convincing themselves that they can't be anything but 100% correct, and refuse to hear anything to the contrary, don't you?\nPeople like that need to hear the unvarnished truth, whether they like it or not. \nAnd bravo to your husband for having your back.", "NTA - That's what they get for assuming. They get the truth. Good for you.", "NTA- They should be feeling shame. All you did there was give them the facts.", "NTA, they fucked around and found out"]}
