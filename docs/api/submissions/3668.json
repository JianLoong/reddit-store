He left her and then I was born a few months later. When I was 6 months old my mom got arrested. The man I have known as my dad my whole life, sister's bio dad, did not want us to grow up apart so he took me in. My bio is a POS. He had a son after me and was trying to use him to get to me. Dad tried to help us have contact but bio showed to be not a good parent and so dad reported him to CPS. Dad ended up adopting him too. So the three of us were raised together. My sister the only bio of dad's but us not caring because he treated all three of us the same.\n\nI am used to comments about me not being dad's real daughter or how he only adopted my brother because he wanted a son if he had to raise two girls (where we grew up people were nosy, gossiped a lot and were unafraid of being mean).

They expected me to have my husband's dad walk me down the aisle at my wedding, have said how sad it is I never knew my dad, and many other comments about not having a real parent. My husband and I took a break from them because they would not listen to him and stop saying those things. They apologized and we had just started being around them again when they said our future children would at least have two grandparents. My husband said our kids would have three. They brushed him off. So we were done again. But I was so mad that I really leaned in on what they were saying. I pointed out how terrible it is to have a dad who loves his kids regardless of blood and instead two criminal parents would have been better, parents who would not be good to their kids, and I went into details about just how bad things would have been with bio and how fucked up my mom is. I wanted them to feel bad for ever implying the man who saved my brother and I and who raised us was less our parent. And it worked. They were mad though and said on top of depressing everyone I was an asshole for trying to make them feel like shit.

Well, it's often misused by people like your in-laws. The actual, full saying goes: \"The blood of the covenant is thicker than the water of the womb\". That is to say - your true family are the people who are there for you, who have chosen to treat you as family should. That \"blood of the covenant\", that choice, is thicker, is more real and much more important, than \"the water of the womb\", those initial biological ties.\n\nYou clearly know what the true meaning of family is, and your husband's parents should be grateful for that. I'm really glad to hear your husband is standing by you and your family! And I'm sorry that his parents keep dismissing your true family with those nasty remarks. They clearly haven't gotten the messege if they're still trying to make you feel bad for speaking up about how this hurts you. If they do feel guilty, good, they should. They need to seriously reflect on what they think family is, and why they feel the need to constantly dismiss yours, even when it hurts their relationship with you and their son. They don't understand what it means to choose to be a family. It seems like you and your husband do, I'm sure you'll have a wonderful family and that you'll always remember the amazing feeling of having your actual dad, the one who chose to live as your dad, walk you down the aisle.", "NTA, how wonderful that you had a dad to love you and take care of you and your siblings when your bio parents were not able to. This is a very lucky situation that doesn't happen often and you should be able to celebrate it with your family and loved ones instead of being made to feel bad or having to defend yourself or your dad. Your husband's parents don't seem like great people so maybe you can cut ties and if you and your husband are ok then he and your future kids can keep a very basic relationship with them (if your husband's parents can be civil). Please remember this: you don't have to suffer just because you married their son.", "Nta clearly", "NTA. You should be proud that you stood up for yourself and your family. They repeatedly attempted to invalidate a loving family because they\u2019re fixated on biology. That shows that they have poor judgement and ignorant opinions. You and your husband have cut these people off multiple times - who cares if they\u2019re angry? You love your husband and he\u2019s the one you want to be with. Stop investing so much time and energy into his horrible relatives. In this case, they\u2019re not a package deal.", "Their anger is at being made to look foolish. They are fools though so don't stress about it. NTA.", "NTA!!\n\nNo you did not go too far! The family were being Assholes not you!

His parents needed to hear it..  to bad that can't take, what they dish...", "NTA. Blood does not make a parent or family. Your dad, is the man who raised you. You tried explaining that to your in laws and they wouldnt listen. So you did it in a way they could finally understand.  Do not feel bad for driving that point home.

You spoke the truth", "NTA- Someone had to call them out and they SHOULD feel bad.", "NTA. Everyone keeps saying how amazing your husband is and how lucky you are, but I hope both of you recognize the reverse is also true. To come from a situation like your\u2019s with the strength that you\u2019ve displayed just in this short post shows a lot of grit and personal fortitude. I imagine that standing up to your in-laws isn\u2019t the only way those personal qualities come through in your life.

Then all hell breaks loose and you're the bad guy for doing to them exactly what they did to you, except you actually just told the truth. \n\nI'd make that \"no contact\" stick for good this time. Once you have kids, I guarantee you that they'll just start this bullshit again, especially once your kids are old enough to start understanding things, but not yet old enough to repeat them back to you.

You can find proverbs with contradictory meanings with relative ease, and just generally there are a lot of dumb saying that have stuck around despite their 'wisdom' being absolute trash.\n\nTo be clear, I do agree with your sentiment about OP being in the right, just pointing out that the \"blood is thicker than water\" thing is rewriting history (and basically pretending that 12th Century morality somehow lines up with 21st Century morality).", "Partial comment stolen from: /u/ca_agent \n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z9mje3/aita_for_trying_to_make_my_husbands_family_feel/iyhrfhc/\n\nBot Reported."]}
