Due to what I mentioned, in my head I expected to come\nhome to the kids in their PJs and calming down time ready for stories. She text her mum to keep them awake for us but didn\u2019t elaborate further.\n\nWhen we arrived home after travelling, we came home to her mum and her sister both there chatting away at the kitchen table not really keeping an eye on the kids, our kids weren\u2019t ready for bed, one of my kids was running around the house and her sister\u2019s kid and my other son were playing unsupervised on my PlayStation and my \u00a33,000 TV in the best room. This is usually out of bounds for my own children unless supervised, I want to keep some nice things where I can and my wife knows how much the TV means to me, I worked hard to save up for it and put time and effort into researching the best model.\n\nI was not at all pleased, after walking around Barcelona all day and then travelling for 6 hours inc flying I did not want to come home to this situation at night so I argued with my wife after they left. \n\nDuring this argument it transpired that my wife had told her mum about a week or two before that it was OK to invite her sister and her son around if she wanted, to keep our kids company. This was never run by me before we went away and never communicated to me, if I had known we could have discussed it properly, discussed boundaries and avoided an argument. I went on further to explain that I obviously didn\u2019t have a problem with her sister and her kid coming to our house generally, but at that time it was inappropriate, I said they could have left earlier before we got home and it wouldn\u2019t have been as much of an issue but I didn\u2019t want them at our house past the kids usual bedtime and also unsupervised in the best room. \n\nAll this upsets my wife and she thinks I\u2019m an unreasonable ass hole, she feels because she organised childcare she had a right to invite who she wants from her family to our house to help out, but I get the impression because she didn\u2019t run it by me because she knew I\u2019d take an issue with it and that she brought the argument on herself by not communicating with me. Iv explained I\u2019m not totally unreasonable but I would have said for them to not play in the best room and for them to leave earlier before we go home so our kids were calming down.\n\nI think my boundaries are not being respected here and that it\u2019s sly for not telling me in advance.\n\nAITA?\n\nUpdate: thanks all, pretty clear consensus is that I\u2019m the asshole.

A lot of this does sound like controlling behavior. YTA", "Honestly this has to be an ESH situation. You should have told your wife what you expected when you got home so she could communicate that with her mom. And it sounds like it wasn\u2019t necessarily that you didn\u2019t want the kids in the room. Just that you didn\u2019t want them in there unsupervised with a bunch of expensive equipment. On top of that, the kids had their own playroom they could have played games on. Next time you use your MIL for free care, layout your expectations to your wife and make sure the both of you are on the same page, and then let your mil know together what those expectations are. Or get a paid for babysitter that won\u2019t trample over your boundaries like how family will do. Because honestly you\u2019re right that your wife\u2019s sister shouldn\u2019t have even been over there at that time. Your kids knew they weren\u2019t supposed to be in that room unsupervised, but were in there playing games when they had their own consoles. And with someone else\u2019s child at that. Because if that kid or your kid had thrown a tantrum and thrown the remote at the tv then you\u2019d be Ass out because if you\u2019d asked them for repayment then you\u2019d be an ah there too. \n\nSo get a paid babysitter, put a lock on the door that only you and your wife have the keys for it.

Yes you do. Do you have the right to flip out if people are in those rooms or using your things if you have not explicitly said so yourself?

These are not outrageous controlling expectations, just consideration.   At the same time, nothing was communicated,  so you get what you get.  Also, keeping small unsupervised children away from very expensive household items is also not controlling.  Many families have rules in place about kids using certain things in certain rooms.

Great plan.", "You\u2019re in for a surprise if you think a babysitter is going to take better care of your kids than their family members", "My god you sound like a spiteful ahole", "So put a lock on the door. \n\nGood on you for valuing things over your children. /s\n\nThe more you comment the more of an AH I see you are.", "Spend more time raising decent human beings moron.", "Your family is learning that you value material possessions more than them.   I predict in the end, you'll find yourself alone surrounded by your possessions with nobody else to enjoy them with.  YTA.", "What does your gender have to do with any of it?", "Reading you other responses it seems that there is some specific equipment in that room. If that is the case, have you explained to you MIL why you do not want the kids to play there?", "What exactly do you think the kids YOU are raising are going to do to your precious TV?", "And how much time have you spent teaching your toddler to not throw things? My toddler liked to bite people. We handled it with love and understanding and ended the behavior within a week.

I also appreciate the length and explanation with your comment and it\u2019s well rounded and helps me understand better", "Excellent point thank you", "Oh I\u2019m definitely an asshole in general.

Are people not allowed any enjoyment besides their children when parents?", "Put a lock on the door? And then seem even more controlling? What a contradictory statement. You have no opinion worth valuing here", "As a woman, I agree.", "I don\u2019t really speak to my MIL, but my wife has an understanding of my prized possessions but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s been communicated no, in the future this will improve and is my number one takeaway from all this thread", "Come on... this guy is not raising the kids. He doesnt even bother to talk to his MIL when leaving her to take care of the kids.", "Ah yeah my kid does that too. Good job on getting it out of them!", "I respect this response.

Jesus, you're obtuse. Still proving how much of an asshole you are.", "And you're a controlling asshole", "You trust your MIL to watch your kids and be in your home but you \"don't really speak\" to her?   \n\nIt's crazy to entrust your children to and ask favors of  someone you don't even bother to maintain a relationship with.

And the idea that you can demand your wife communicate your wants and wishes - without telling her any of that - is just insane. \n\nIn your edit to your post, you made it painfully clear that you do not think highly of couples therapy, but it surely sounds like you are in need of a reality check and alot of therapy.\n\nMaybe get your head out of your ass and realize that the world is not made to cater to you?", "Sounds like your the one on the high horse who has perfect parenting style and kids mate, your the one replying the most. We mayaswell just DM each other", "But you literally can't see what the problem is can you?", "I am not at all the person you are describing. I was homeless at 18 and worked hard to make something of my life. I know very clearly that the world does not cater to me", "Nah. I just didn't think my shit don't stink and I walked on water as a dad. I didn't value my possessions over my family. I actually put in a bit of effort into not raising feral children who would destroy shit on a whim and then blaming them and my in-laws for my own fucking shortcomings as a man. Are we clear yet YTA?", "It does not sound like it from ANYTHING you have written in your post or comments. It makes you seem like an entitled, spoiled, arrogant... well... AH.\n\nAs I suggested: get into therapy.", "Honestly at this point wtf are you taking about? I don\u2019t have feral children, I have a toddler that slightly misbehaves and needs a bit of extra watching over. \n\nYou are the one being unreasonable in our communication now, you project this perfection of your own situation and then have massively exaggerated what I have replied back to you with. I even congratulated you on getting the biting out of your son and you threw it back it in my face, so you aren\u2019t as civiled as you think."]}
