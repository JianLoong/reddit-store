This was never run by me before we went away and never communicated to me, if I had known we could have discussed it properly, discussed boundaries and avoided an argument.

You should have told your wife what you expected when you got home so she could communicate that with her mom. And it sounds like it wasn\u2019t necessarily that you didn\u2019t want the kids in the room. Just that you didn\u2019t want them in there unsupervised with a bunch of expensive equipment. On top of that, the kids had their own playroom they could have played games on. Next time you use your MIL for free care, layout your expectations to your wife and make sure the both of you are on the same page, and then let your mil know together what those expectations are. Or get a paid for babysitter that won\u2019t trample over your boundaries like how family will do. Because honestly you\u2019re right that your wife\u2019s sister shouldn\u2019t have even been over there at that time. Your kids knew they weren\u2019t supposed to be in that room unsupervised, but were in there playing games when they had their own consoles. And with someone else\u2019s child at that. Because if that kid or your kid had thrown a tantrum and thrown the remote at the tv then you\u2019d be Ass out because if you\u2019d asked them for repayment then you\u2019d be an ah there too. \n\nSo get a paid babysitter, put a lock on the door that only you and your wife have the keys for it.

Yes you do. Do you have the right to flip out if people are in those rooms or using your things if you have not explicitly said so yourself? No. This is the crux of the problem, no matter who knows what, including your wife who probably should know you best, it is up to each of us individually to communicate our vision and expectation to others.

These are not outrageous controlling expectations, just consideration.   At the same time, nothing was communicated,  so you get what you get.  Also, keeping small unsupervised children away from very expensive household items is also not controlling.  Many families have rules in place about kids using certain things in certain rooms.

You knew your wife only informed your MIL to keep them awake without specifying that you wanted them prepared for bed yet you were angry they weren\u2019t prepared for bed? You could have informed your MIL yourself or at least asked your wife to add your bedtime specifications to her communications yet you refused to. That\u2019s on you. Not on your wife or her family. \n\nSame thing with the children using the PlayStation or the TV. You didn\u2019t specify to either your MIL or wife that it was off limits unless supervised while you were away so you can\u2019t be surprised that it was used unsupervised. You say that your wife knows how much it means to you and I infer that means you expected her to say something. However, as an adult, putting someone else in charge of your boundaries is unfair. In addition, the fact you didn\u2019t know whether your wife told your MIL about the best room tells me how little a role you played in organizing childcare, which just seems unfair in general. \n\nPersonally, I don\u2019t see anything wrong with family members dropping in, especially if other family members are already there. I especially don\u2019t see anything wrong with extra family coming over to help with childcare I\u2019m getting for free. \n\nI certainly wouldn\u2019t have seen the issue with my sister dropping by my place when my mother was already there but maybe it\u2019s a cultural thing. In that case, then perhaps your wife should have communicated with you that she gave the ok for her sister to stay with your MIL while babysitting. But from the looks of it, it seems like you left arranging childcare completely up to your wife. Therefore, it\u2019s not unreasonable for your wife to think that because she was left to do this task alone that allowing her sister and her nephew to keep the children and their babysitting MIL company was also part of this task and thus up to her alone. \n\nBut to me it seems like your frustration is less that your wife invited her sister over and more that you had to see your sister after coming home from a trip? I get it, you\u2019re tired, you probably don\u2019t want to socialize and you just want to tuck the kids into bed and get to sleep yourself. But it\u2019s a real AH move to treat just seeing your SIL and nephew as a chore. \n\nIn summary:\n\nYou\u2019re upset with your wife about her lack of communication yet you didn\u2019t communicate with her either. You didn\u2019t establish your own boundaries yet you\u2019re angry when they\u2019re overstepped. \n\nYour wife\u2019s right.

But you should assume that you\u2019re a team and you both want what\u2019s best for your children. She\u2019s not your subordinate and she didn\u2019t fail a task because a third party didn\u2019t meet expectations that you didn\u2019t communicate.\n\nFor example, you can have an adults-only room. But most people wouldn\u2019t assume a room like this is out of bounds for children unless the door is locked or they\u2019ve been told. Locking the room (with your wife\u2019s consent and while giving her a key) is a way to communicate to other people in the house that it is a space that is off-limits.\n\nBut the controlling aspect here is that when things weren\u2019t as you wanted them, you immediately got angry at your wife and assumed she\u2019d failed to relay your expectations to other people and blamed her for this. You wanted her to read your mind, understand the million invisible rules, relay them all perfectly, and then if her family messed up, she was the one you\u2019d get angry at. \n\nBut she was with you the whole time. In the same way you can\u2019t expect perfection from your toddler who might throw things sometimes, you can\u2019t expect perfection from third parties and then blame their failures on your wife. And even if she did know what you had wanted, she obviously didn\u2019t do this maliciously. So it feels like you emotionally punished her and blamed her for something that wasn\u2019t really a big deal in the end\u2014so essentially that you treated her as a child instead of as an equal half of a parenting team.\n\nAnd sometimes reasonable minds can differ. If there are things you haven\u2019t discussed that could be reasonable to other people, like allowing family members over, you shouldn\u2019t punish your wife for having a different idea of what is good for your children.\n\nIn the comments you talk about taking over preparing childcare and paying someone external to do it correctly next time\u2014but that feels a bit tantrum-like without further context. Like you think you can do this better than your wife can, and like a stranger would be better for your kids than family because they didn\u2019t understand your message about keeping the kids up exactly as you wanted. A different babysitter will also only be able to take care of your children with the expectations you communicate. The comments suggesting this are doing so because it means you won\u2019t be able to be angry with your wife\u2014but I think you should talk to her about what she wants and what would actually be better for your children first.\n\nFrom your comments, it sounds like there might be deeper issues with her side of the family as you don\u2019t really speak to them. Are you perhaps more resentful of them for these reasons? Is there a deeper frustration there? Is there a reason you don\u2019t want them caring for your children or trust their judgement? If it were your family members, would you be as angry if they let them stay up past their bedtime?\n\nSometimes even good family is messy. Grandparents will give kids treats and aunts will have different rules. Sometimes others make mistakes or make different choices to what you would. Sometimes kids stay up past their bedtimes or learn a bad word. This isn\u2019t inherently a bad thing. Kids need routines and structure, but they also need to learn how to deal with disruptions because they happen in the real world too. \n\nAnd while that messiness can be frustrating in the short-term, it also surrounds the kids with love and joy and different people, which is a good thing. Sometimes you let things go because it\u2019s better for your children to have their village and friends and close relationships with the people in their extended family.\n\nAnger is a signal to you, not a tool to use against others. When you have a strong emotional response, your brain is telling you something so try to figure out why. Coming home from a trip, that signal could mean general exhaustion and frustration. That\u2019s not your wife\u2019s fault so process it healthily and then move forward. If it is signalling something deeper about your wife\u2019s family, wait until you\u2019re at a place where you can articulate that with kindness and sensitivity to your wife\u2019s perspective, and then communicate that. \n\nI think it\u2019s generally a good rule, assuming you love your wife and your marriage is generally healthy, to assume your partner has good intentions and to try to work with them in good faith.", "Kids old enough to play a video game system are also generally beyond the age of wantonly throwing things.", "I trust her family so I don\u2019t get an absolute earful off her when I suggest otherwise tbh.

To techie people, a $3K 70' flatscreen and a $300 70' TV are basically the same thing. If your kids knew better, punish them and not your wife and her family. Kids aren't as innocent as they may seem y'know and will try and pull a fast one to get around rules. \n\nAlso, it's your wife's mum. Her MIL. Unless she was a teen mom, then she's most likely in her 50s/60s (no ages are specified so I'm presuming).
