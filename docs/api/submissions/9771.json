Some sugar spread over an entire recipe of muesli isn\u2019t bad! And as for the bread, if it\u2019s too dense it sounds like she might be using expired yeast. It really makes a difference! Yeast is alive and dead yeast won\u2019t work. Check the yeast she is using and see if that\u2019s the problem. As for the muesli, can you add some sugar to your portion? NTA.", "NTA. You told your mum that her home made stuff was bad quality and she still kept making it and forcing it on you because of her own ideas of healthy and cheap. This makes her an AH, not you.", "NTA.\n\nAnd lol at the comments aiming to explain breadmaking to you. It's not your job to teach your mom to make bread, it's her job to make sure you are fed properly. She's the parent. Whatever she is doing to the bread, it is making you physically ill, so she needs to either provide an alternative while she works on her skills, or stop making bread and go back to buying it. You might not have been very nice in conveying this sentiment, but it did need to be said.", "NTA. Your mom\u2019s pride is getting in the way of reality.", "NTA for not liking poorly made food.\n\nSlight Y T A for how you went about telling your mom.\n\nA little diplomacy goes a long way. Try baking with her. Or asking her to teach you to use the bread machine so you can try other recipes. \n\nAnd just an aside\u2014you can make good bread without sugar, but it requires longer resting times between kneadings. My guess would be that the bread machine can\u2019t compensate for the lack of sugar. And reducing/eliminating sugar makes bread drier, so it\u2019s a good guess that Mom is eliminating the sugar. It also means the bread will go stale faster.", "Info: how old are you?\n\nIf you\u2019re a child, NTA.\n\nIf you have your own income though and just live with her, YTA: buy your own food.", "NTA I feel like your mum could do better. Making good bread really isn't that hard and it sounds like she's not trying out any new recipes for it. Cooking and Baking requires experimentation and it doesn't seem like she does that. \n\nIf you want to help solve this problem, maybe suggest another recipe or even make it yourself. Also, for the love of all that is holy, don't use a bread machine for it. A regular oven works way better", "NTA - but I think you went about it the wrong way. I'd research how she could improve. Find her some videos. I'd ask her to make 'this bread from this video.' and let her watch it and see where she might be going wrong and can make improvements.

It\u2019s sort of like the \u201cGolden Rule\u201d when you\u2019re a kid.  My mom did this to me too mainly because she thought she was doing something nice for me but mostly was awful and I would throw away but would feel so guilty knowing her intentions and time it took to make. So I found recipes I liked and would tell her they were my favorite or were recommended by a chef etc. in order to get her to make what I wanted. \nPlay the game kid. How old are you?", "NTA. QUESTIONS:\n\nIs she making yeast bread or quick bread? Is she giving the yeast enough time to bloom? Is she using metal pans to mix it up in before the final rise (if yeast bread).\n\nI'd really like to know what recipe she uses, it sounds like there isn't enough air in the dough, either that or she could be over kneading which makes it tough. \n\nMaybe you can get a mix specifically made FOR bread machines, do it yourself- follow directions exactly and compare to her bread, have HER compare them. She may need a side by side comparison to be able to tell how different it is  \n\nYeast bread is an art, not everyone can do it well because you have to FEEL the dough at certain points and also there is a part where the way you know it's ready for the next step, it has to LOOK smooth and satiny, and not everyone is great at judging that. It isn't hard, but you MUST be objective about the flavor, texture etc, or be able to take the criticism if it doesn't turn out well, then be willing to practice and experiment until you get it right. \n\nGood luck, and I am wishing for your mom's bread to start becoming delicious and amazing when she figures out the way for making great bread.", "YTA, youre being a brat. You want store bought bread/muesli? Go buy your own.", "NTA. I have a 16 year old and recognise that he's entitled to his opinions and preferences.

You're still a kid, so it's not bad, but next time, communicate sooner to avoid things boiling over. \n\nMy girlfriend makes bread and it's amazing. There are different recipes. I suggest finding recipes you might enjoy and making them something you can do together. That way, she still gets to make bread, and you have a say in what gets made. Just a thought", "I've got a bread machine, and in my experience those things are incredibly fussy. Our bread sometimes turns out kinda funky, and I get it, it's annoying when you're trying to slice something and it crumbles to pieces. \n\nYou might get a better reaction from your mum if you show interest in what she's doing, and approach the things you don't like in a more constructive manner, e.g. \"It's hard to make sandwiches with this recipe, because it keeps falling apart. Do you know how to fix that?\" Then you can work on a solution. \n\nNTA, because you're 16 and it's a fair call to not like something, but the best way to make a change is to approach your mum in a way that isn't (directly or indirectly) insulting to her.

At my job we make all our own bread and it took the chef years to perfect the sourdough to what it is today.", "NTA, why not just take the muesli she makes and add your own sugar.  Although sugar is really just awful for us but our brains love it more than heroin, maybe try stevia.  As to the bread, bread makers suck.", "If she's not using sugar the yeast may not be able to bloom properly either.", "This is hilarious to me cos there's literally a brand of bread called Mother's Pride in the UK \ud83d\ude01", "I am 16 attending highschool.", "Glutinous bread.

The mushy, I totally get, but she's by no means a bad cook.", "I am 16, but I feel that the intentions of her effort have been misguided. Instead of eating healthier muesli, I dont eat muesli. Instead of eating dense bread I don't eat bread.", "She uses yeast in her recipes, but to my knowledge its just mixing quantities of flour, milk Ect. IDK what else, but yeast is an ingredient. \nIt goes into a bread machine, which has a paddle in the bottom, and I think its just adjusting settings and leaving it for a half hour or so.\n\n(Edit:) I know how bread work, how leaving it for longer affects it gluten content, and how stretchy it will be eg. Stretchy until see-through, and how these factorabimpacy bubble size and density.", "The kid is 16, come on. Parents should take care of their kids and not give them un-eatable chewy bread that makes him/her sick.", "Good point!", "I wanted to say straight off that you're wrong, but the  reality is if she's using a breadmaker it may well need some easy sugar source, otherwise it might not be getting long enough to digest the natural sugars from the flour. Hell, it was 28\u00b0C today at mine, and it still needed 4 hours for just the first rise. Or it could be a lower gluten flour and not bread flour being used. Or too little hydration?\n\nI've never added sugar to musli, though - but I add fruit and yoghurt, so that's basically the same thing, yeah? \n\nOP, NTA. But maybe experiment a bit with the musli and see if you can find a way to make it palatable- whether that's adding sugar, fresh or stewed fruit, or something like grated apple with cinnamon and almond butter and yoghurt stirred through, flavoured yoghurt, or even if the musli would lend itself to Bircher style (soaked with milk or even apple juice).", "NTA, then.\n\nYour mum is still obliged to feed you and you shouldn\u2019t need feel sick and change your diet to not offend her sense of accomplishment.", "If the bread is dense and it's a glutinous type either her yeast is expired or she's not adding enough sugar/yeast to the recipe.  Yeast needs sugar in order to grow and make fluffy bread.", "If she's not adding sugar the yeast won't rise and the bread will be yucky and dense.", "Well, maybe see if you can get hold of a package of premade yeast bread machine mix that you just add water to. Doing her own taste comparison may be the only way she will see the difference...if the premade stuff tastes/feels the same, then maybe it's the machine itself???  \n\nI have never used a bread machine, -been making my own home made bread since around 1978- no such thing as a home appliance for bread making back then. So basically, I'd be no help with knowing if the machine is what is messing it up. \n\nOther than that, maybe start doing it yourself and then adjusting the recipes. It should be easy to learn with the machine and google is your best friend when you need recipes OR EVEN to find out what went wrong with your recipe. I'm lazy, so I don't bother putting new information into my old cookbooks anymore.  I just take my phone with me into the kitchen these days, but my simple yeast bread recipe is ingrained in my brain, so I never even look at a recipe for that anymore. \n\nI hope you can figure this out, GOOD, fresh,  homemade bread is heavenly and we should all experience its deliciousness sometimes!", "It maybe not as bad as I let on, but the bread is the main flavour of a sandwich, and often ends up as crumbs upon slicing.", "I had a job at 16.

Kid could learn some tact instead of barking orders at their mother.", "When I used a breadmaker, all of the recipes called for a bit of sugar\u2026even the ones that used a box mix.", "If she's leaving the sugar out the muesli too, this is probably it. She thinks she's making \"healthier\" bread and doesn't realise the yeast needs to eat the sugar! That it's there for a scientific reason, not as a sweetener.", "I has a job too at 15 or 16 but that doesn't mean you should have to provide for your own food as a child????", "I don't use a breadmaker, but to be fair, I don't have room for one - our kitchen is too teeny. But I'd love to have one of those programmable ones, so I wouldn't have to add sugar because I could set it for a long enough rise stage etc, and to finish baking about 1/2 hour before I wake up in the morning.
