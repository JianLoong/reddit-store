I mill my own flours, crack grains and actually freshly roll oats for granola.\n\nBread can be incredibly easy, and I can\u2019t fathom how she is screwing it up so badly.  UNLESS she is making soda bread, which is basically a giant baking powder biscuit, and doesn\u2019t contain yeast.  THAT can be trickier, and easier to make taste bad.", "She\u2019s probably not using sugar so the yeast does not work properly", "This but she could also be using cold water instead of warm water. Cold water doesn\u2019t work well for yeast so the bread will be dense and taste yucky. Yes, I made the mistake and had to toss the bread. \ud83e\udd72", "OP can buy or make their own bread?\n\nI'm suspicious about mom's bread actually making them physically sick. That's what my kids say when they don't like something \ud83d\ude02\n\nBut agree with you re NTA and that OP is never going to get anywhere passing on Reddit breadmaking advice.", "dense bread can also happen if salt is omitted", "Exactly. So OP should try making better bread themselves. They aren't a baby bird.", "I think the suggestion that she's not using sugar *in a bread machine* is probably key.   Bread machines have very rigid timings, and the yeast needs to be ready when the bake cycle kicks in.  \n\nI prefer hand-making bread, too, and I agree with everything you said.  But when I hand-make bread, if the rise goes an hour long, I just shrug and wait until it's light enough.  Bread machines can't.", "Every bread recipe in my bread maker requires some form of sugar, because the dry yeast needs that to feed off or the bread won't rise. Salt is added to prevent the bread from over-rising and collapsing. It's definitely possible to mess up a bread in the bread maker (for instance if you let the yeast get in contact with the salt before it starts mixing as that kills the yeast) but shouldn't be that bad if you follow the actual recipe and instructions. \n\nOP, it's a tricky situation. Criticising someone's cooking is always hard and often hurts the person who made the effort, but if you can't stomach the result you're not wrong for pointing that out. Could you maybe try and make a bread in the breadmaker yourself to see if you can produce an acceptable loaf? That way perhaps you can help your mom improve her skill in a cooperative way without it being overly critical? Best of luck in any case.", "Be honest. Does the bread actually physically make you sick? For real?\n\n....or do you just really not like it? That's okay if so. But don't claim illness if that's literally not the case.", "Or if there isn't enough water in the mix.\n\nA dough that's too dry will never rise properly.\n\nNTA, OP. It's her right to bake bread, it's yours not to eat it. Just be tactful.", "And, as everyone knows, salt is *unhealthy*. /s", "And a lot of people in some parts of the world don't understand that yeast will consume the sugars in the flour if allowed enough time.", "[removed]", "No, and it does sound like there's something wrong with the bread. OP has said in another comment that there's yeast and milk in there, so I'm guessing it's the flour, the hydration, or the bread machine settings.\n\nBut that's might also be something else at play here, since OP has a problem with musli without sugar, a food which doesn't normally have sugar in it.", "*shrugs* guess it's too much effort lol", "OP has other options besides complaining, like learning how to make their own, better, bread. This is a case of \"I've tried nothing and I'm all out of ideas.\"", "I use dried in mine, I've never used freeze dried. OP has said they've seen the recipe, but might not have seen what their mum is adding.", "Flour has carbohydrates in in which the yeast can digest. The loaf I made yesterday is a pefect example of this - flour, salt, yeast and water. That's it.", "Yeast can eat lots of different sugars and carbohydrates. You don't need to add sugar to bread (or even to beer, for that matter) to get the yeast to work, as they can consume what is naturally in the grains.", "Yeah not the same. \n\nBut would still just cut the mold off and eat the cheese. Have you not?", "Well, I think there's more than a few of us in agreement here with that. The loaf I made yesterday was only flour, yeast, salt and water, and that's typical of all the loaves made in my family", "I'm assuming a lot of people commenting either don't understand that yeasts can work with the sugars and carbohydrates in the flours and grains (it just takes a bit longer), or are from the US where their bread is as sweet as our yeast buns elsewhere?"]}
