That is entirely too many people for one household and you may be evicted by exceeding the occupancy of the place. You sound understandably stressed because you have no place to decompress other than your bedroom and your home appears to need you constantly. Is there an end in sight for all these visitors? If not, I\u2019d rethink your living situation as it sounds like your mental health may be deteriorating due to stress.  You don\u2019t deserve to burn yourself out for other people family or not.

They all need to follow the salesperson out out out! NTA", "NTA.\n\nInviting a salesman into an already crowded house wasn\u2019t the wisest thing for your sister to do. Not to mention, a lot of apartments have a limit on how many people can live in one apartment. If the salesman reported that 6 people were living in an apartment that\u2019s only supposed to have 2 residents, there could be big trouble for your family.\n\nYou sound like you\u2019re definitely stressed by what\u2019s going on with your family but you\u2019re very kind still trying to make everyone happy.

This particular guy was schilling pots and pans. My niece was outside playing on the slide and fell off in a scary manner. She was screaming bloody murder so we played it safe and called 911. While this is going on, this asshat is still trying to get my mil to buy pots and pans. My mil, bless her heart was just too polite to tell this guy to gtfo. Roughly 30 minutes after we called 911, the wee woo wagon along with the fire dept and police come roaring down our neighbors driveway. We were all outside in the driveway trying to direct them down our driveway, so that was 5 minutes wasted. Anyway, this guy still hasn't taken the hint. He was fully aware of what was going on, and still word vomited his pitch. Even had the gall to say that us calling 911 for my niece was unnecessary. I really wanted to throw him out on his ass but mil wouldn't let us say anything or get near him. Ems checks on my niece. She doesn't have any sign of head or neck trauma so they leave it up to my sil if she wanted to go to er by ambulance or pov. Niece has calmed down but complains her arm hurts. Sil loads her up and takes her to the er. Niece had a small hairline fracture on her arm and got a temporary cast. This guy didn't leave until 8pm.  He had been there since 3, incident happened around 4 430. It was ridiculous.", "INFO: Why is your Mom sleeping in the living room, and not you?", "I think she was enjoying the attention. Idk?

Unfortunately finding a place in NYC is crazy hard, even if you have the money >.<", "Because I'm not the one who sponsored her; it was my mother who made the decision to bring her here and therefore it's my mother who has to find the proper accommodations for her. And while I help where I can, I\u2019m not that self-sacrificing to give up what I'm paying for.", "I\u2019m going with NTA, you\u2019re entitled to end a hard day without some random salesman in an already cramped space.  Maybe if sis also paid rent she can have more say about guests (that\u2019s a stretch, it\u2019s a salesman after all) but it was obviously not cool with the rent paying folks in the home (you said mom was annoyed too right?).  When she gets her own place she can visit with water filter salesman to her hearts content.  Hope you finally got the rest and relaxation you needed."]}
