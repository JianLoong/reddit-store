If your partner won't support you in difficult times over something so vain and ridiculous, you should really consider if the marriage is worth staying in. Your husband decided that his vanity and protecting his own toxic image of masculinity and how others could potentially perceive his manhood if you were taller was more important to him than being there for you in a situation where you needed him to be there as an emotional support. And in addition, he has also involved his own family, set his family on you like you are the unreasonable one here and see no wrong in what he did. I doubt I'd ever be able to  forgive this and I would never be able to look at him the same way again. I could never imagine doing something so unkind and unloving to a life partner. If he is so insecure about his height, he should do something about it rather than force you to accommodate his insecurity at every turn. He could get his own heels or boots with inserts, therapy is a must regardless because he has real issues if he's willing to go this far to not risk anyone thinking anything negative about his height while standing next to his wife. \n\n\nI lost my dad too, and my husband at the time did go with me to the funeral. However, he made us late because he stopped to talk to someone he knew and just had to have a cigarette with them, so I ended up arriving 10 minutes before the service started when I wanted to be there early to greet people and be there for my family. He was also medicated (as in, self medicated with illegal drugs) and not really mentally 'present' or properly awake during the service, then he left right before the gathering we had afterwards because he was tired, so he went home and fell asleep on the couch. I arrived home some hours later and was locked out of the house because he didn't leave the key where I asked him to. I didn't have pockets on my outfit and I didn't own a purse either so I didn't bring my key (which he obviously knew), calling him didn't do diddly squat because he wouldn't wake up due to whatever he took earlier in the day.
