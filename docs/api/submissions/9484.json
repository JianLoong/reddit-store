I have to make sure that I can refinance it because it's so new but either way I can see what I can do to get your name off the loan quicker even if I can't refinance it.\u201d\n\nI then said \u201cThat\u2019s great! But, from what I have reviewed, the only way to take me off is to refinance. I wish there was a different way but there isn\u2019t. \u201c\n\nTo which she said \u201cOk. Yea I\u2019m working on getting it refinanced \u201c \n\nThen months went by and we\u2019re now in February. I got a text from Best Buy thanking me for my order. I quickly signed into my account and found that they purchased a gaming laptop that was pink for over 2500$. \n\nI decided to cancel the order. (Does this make me an asshole?) I then later got a text from her saying \u201cDid you go in and change the Best Buy information?\u201d\n\nI replied \u201cI got several texts from my Best Buy saying I had an order for over 2k dollars so I changed my password just in case I was hacked\u201d\n\nShe then replied \u201cThat was me. Because the credit card is under my name and I took you off of the account so you wouldn\u2019t be affected \u201c The credit card is in her name yes, but she used my Best Buy account to order the laptop.\n\nI then replied \u201cAh, that makes more sense lol. So you can order over 2k in electronics from Best Buy on a credit card but can\u2019t refinance your car?\u201d\n\nTo which she replied \u201cYes because I need $10,000 up front in order to refinance the car but I can make a minimum of $200 payments every month. I need a laptop for school.\u201d Am I the asshole for calling her out and cancelling the order? \n\nI personally feel if she needed a laptop for school it wouldn\u2019t be a pink razed gaming laptop and she could have not used MY Best Buy account to order it. I feel like she did it so I would see it because that\u2019s the petty person she\u2019s been.", "created_utc": 1675895738, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10xd4lj/aita_for_cancelling_my_exwifes_laptop_order/", "score": 569, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Instead of making payments on a laptop, she needs to be using that $200 a month to figure out the car thing. And you're right to call her out when she's financing expensive laptops after assuring you she was working on refinancing her vehicle, which she clearly isn't.", "NTA. But you are a bit of a doormat to let the court ordered dates pass without doing anything about getting your name removed from her accounts. She recognizes that and has no intention of getting you removed. If it was supposed to happen in 90 days, at 91 days you should have had her back in court", "NTA, for all you knew your account was hacked. If she removed your card info and replaced it with hers, then why couldn't she just as easily set up her own account?  As for the car, what's this $10,000 that she needs?  I refi'ed mine right away after my divorce, it was less than a year since I'd bought it. No money needed, just called my bank and worked out terms, credit check, etc. Done.", "I'd say NTA.

Rightfully canceled it and update the account into. NTA.\n\nHowever, your statements regarding the computer vs the car were out of line.

But YTA for calling her out like buying electronics and refinancing are car are equivalent actions.", "ESH if she\u2019s not following the divorce decree, then talk to your lawyer. Canceling her order was incredibly passive aggressive", "ESH - If you feel she ordered the laptop so that you would see it and then you cancelled it, then you are both petty.  It was on her credit card, no real foul to you.  The question was whether you are an AH for cancelling the order - The car is another issue.", "YTA softly - yes she went in via your acct but the charge was on her credit card.  This was you acting out because she hasn't done the refinance.  You no longer get a say in her purchases.\n\nPath I always take with the ex is to take the high road in every decision.  Really cuts down the drama.", "YTA.\n\nThe specific question is whether your the AH for cancelling an order your ex-wife made and is paying for just because you are tied to the Best Buy account associated with her credit card. Based on your post, I am under the impression that you knew it was your ex-wife making the purchase, and you're only using \"fraud\" as an excuse to be petty. From what you wrote, it doesn't appear that you are financially responsible for said laptop. Are you going to cancel any purchase she makes with her credit card just because you can?\n\nClearly this is a revenge thing because you're pissed she hasn't followed through with refinancing the car. Yes, that is not acceptable and she needs to do that so she doesn't negatively impact your credit. But do you have concerns that she will miss payments? Does she owe you money? Because nothing you said indicated anything other than you wanting to make her life difficult.", "ETA although I'd be that kind of petty too.", "YTA - She's your ex wife.  Her purchases are none of your business, and you shouldn't be interfering with them.   You won't like to hear it, but your ex is also under no obligation to refinance the vehicle either.   You signed your name on the loan documents.   You two breaking up doesn't change that.   \n\nIf she refinances, she's doing you a favor, not fulfilling any kind of obligation you think she has here.  You're completely out of line.\n\nIf you kept this up she should file a restraining order.", "You're assuming the worst of her, which says something about you. If it's the best buy account she's used to using, it's not surprising she wouldn't think I'd it as yours. And refinancing isn't always possible. The cars and refinancing should have been handled as part of the divorce, and it sounds like neither of you did that right at the time. And I don't buy that you thought your account was hacked, since you changed the password but didn't cancel your credit card or anything. You were being petty, too. ESH.", "YTA but luckily she can reorder it. She can do what she wants with her money if she wants to make $200 a month payments on a gaming computer, that\u2019s her business. \n\nIf it takes her $10,000 to refinance the car and she doesn\u2019t have it, then your name is gonna be on that car for a while. She probably should have told you that, but oh well. \n\nMaybe she just was already logged into your account automatically and didn\u2019t think about it until she placed the order? Who knows. Doesn\u2019t really matter except it makes you an asshole for not checking in with her first to see if she made a mistake and before you cancelled it.", "YTA her purchases are not your business anymore, definitely aren\u2019t yours to cancel. Am not surprised things didn\u2019t work out.", "YTA - passive aggressive \n\nBut \n\nShe\u2019s in breach of contract and should be putting those $200 a month away for a payment. \n\nUnless she\u2019s doing a STEM degree where she really does need a high powered laptop.", "YTA....Having 2K doesn't mean you can refinance a car.\n\nAlsp, your divorce decree wouldn't stand up in court.  You can't require someone to do something that may not be possible for them.", "I n f o: did you actually think you might have been hacked, or did you suspect it was her using her own money but cancel it to be petty? And what are your legal agreements regarding getting your name off the loan?\n\nTbh this sounds like to contentious of a divorce for you two to be communicating about the serious financial stuff without lawyers involved\n\nEdit: per ops reply NTA. You cancelled a purchase that you thought was fraudulent. And she's ta for not refinancing and for basically ignoring that part of the divorce agreement. Tho op if you're serious about getting your name off that loan I'd be taking legal action on it in your shoes cause I don't think ex wife will do it on her own", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
