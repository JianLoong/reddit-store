I have to make sure that I can refinance it because it's so new but either way I can see what I can do to get your name off the loan quicker even if I can't refinance it.\u201d\n\nI then said \u201cThat\u2019s great! But, from what I have reviewed, the only way to take me off is to refinance. I wish there was a different way but there isn\u2019t. \u201c\n\nTo which she said \u201cOk. Yea I\u2019m working on getting it refinanced \u201c \n\nThen months went by and we\u2019re now in February. I got a text from Best Buy thanking me for my order. I quickly signed into my account and found that they purchased a gaming laptop that was pink for over 2500$. \n\nI decided to cancel the order. (Does this make me an asshole?) I then later got a text from her saying \u201cDid you go in and change the Best Buy information?\u201d\n\nI replied \u201cI got several texts from my Best Buy saying I had an order for over 2k dollars so I changed my password just in case I was hacked\u201d\n\nShe then replied \u201cThat was me. Because the credit card is under my name and I took you off of the account so you wouldn\u2019t be affected \u201c The credit card is in her name yes, but she used my Best Buy account to order the laptop.\n\nI then replied \u201cAh, that makes more sense lol. So you can order over 2k in electronics from Best Buy on a credit card but can\u2019t refinance your car?\u201d\n\nTo which she replied \u201cYes because I need $10,000 up front in order to refinance the car but I can make a minimum of $200 payments every month. I need a laptop for school.\u201d Am I the asshole for calling her out and cancelling the order? \n\nI personally feel if she needed a laptop for school it wouldn\u2019t be a pink razed gaming laptop and she could have not used MY Best Buy account to order it. I feel like she did it so I would see it because that\u2019s the petty person she\u2019s been.", "created_utc": 1675895738, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10xd4lj/aita_for_cancelling_my_exwifes_laptop_order/", "score": 107, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Instead of making payments on a laptop, she needs to be using that $200 a month to figure out the car thing. And you're right to call her out when she's financing expensive laptops after assuring you she was working on refinancing her vehicle, which she clearly isn't.", "NTA. But you are a bit of a doormat to let the court ordered dates pass without doing anything about getting your name removed from her accounts. She recognizes that and has no intention of getting you removed. If it was supposed to happen in 90 days, at 91 days you should have had her back in court", "NTA, for all you knew your account was hacked. If she removed your card info and replaced it with hers, then why couldn't she just as easily set up her own account?  As for the car, what's this $10,000 that she needs?  I refi'ed mine right away after my divorce, it was less than a year since I'd bought it. No money needed, just called my bank and worked out terms, credit check, etc. Done.", "I'd say NTA.

Seriously she needs to get your name off the Liam as agreed upon in divorce.", "I got divorced and we just went to the bank to have my name taken off his car loan.

Maybe you guys can go in together and explain to the banker/dealership?\n\nEdit: I live in Florida, and the other thing was we had to go to the DMV and get my name removed off the title before we could get me off the loan.", "NTA for cancelling the order but it sounds like you might have some other issues to work out here.", "NTA you need to go back to court if she's not adhering to the divorce decree", "NTA.

Rightfully canceled it and update the account into. NTA.\n\nHowever, your statements regarding the computer vs the car were out of line.

But YTA for calling her out like buying electronics and refinancing are car are equivalent actions.", "ESH if she\u2019s not following the divorce decree, then talk to your lawyer. Canceling her order was incredibly passive aggressive", "ESH - If you feel she ordered the laptop so that you would see it and then you cancelled it, then you are both petty.  It was on her credit card, no real foul to you.  The question was whether you are an AH for cancelling the order - The car is another issue.", "YTA softly - yes she went in via your acct but the charge was on her credit card.  This was you acting out because she hasn't done the refinance.  You no longer get a say in her purchases.\n\nPath I always take with the ex is to take the high road in every decision.  Really cuts down the drama.", "YTA.\n\nThe specific question is whether your the AH for cancelling an order your ex-wife made and is paying for just because you are tied to the Best Buy account associated with her credit card. Based on your post, I am under the impression that you knew it was your ex-wife making the purchase, and you're only using \"fraud\" as an excuse to be petty. From what you wrote, it doesn't appear that you are financially responsible for said laptop. Are you going to cancel any purchase she makes with her credit card just because you can?\n\nClearly this is a revenge thing because you're pissed she hasn't followed through with refinancing the car. Yes, that is not acceptable and she needs to do that so she doesn't negatively impact your credit. But do you have concerns that she will miss payments? Does she owe you money? Because nothing you said indicated anything other than you wanting to make her life difficult.", "ETA although I'd be that kind of petty too.", "YTA - She's your ex wife.  Her purchases are none of your business, and you shouldn't be interfering with them.   You won't like to hear it, but your ex is also under no obligation to refinance the vehicle either.   You signed your name on the loan documents.   You two breaking up doesn't change that.   \n\nIf she refinances, she's doing you a favor, not fulfilling any kind of obligation you think she has here.  You're completely out of line.\n\nIf you kept this up she should file a restraining order.", "You're assuming the worst of her, which says something about you. If it's the best buy account she's used to using, it's not surprising she wouldn't think I'd it as yours. And refinancing isn't always possible. The cars and refinancing should have been handled as part of the divorce, and it sounds like neither of you did that right at the time. And I don't buy that you thought your account was hacked, since you changed the password but didn't cancel your credit card or anything. You were being petty, too. ESH.", "YTA but luckily she can reorder it. She can do what she wants with her money if she wants to make $200 a month payments on a gaming computer, that\u2019s her business. \n\nIf it takes her $10,000 to refinance the car and she doesn\u2019t have it, then your name is gonna be on that car for a while. She probably should have told you that, but oh well. \n\nMaybe she just was already logged into your account automatically and didn\u2019t think about it until she placed the order? Who knows. Doesn\u2019t really matter except it makes you an asshole for not checking in with her first to see if she made a mistake and before you cancelled it.", "YTA her purchases are not your business anymore, definitely aren\u2019t yours to cancel. Am not surprised things didn\u2019t work out.", "YTA - passive aggressive \n\nBut \n\nShe\u2019s in breach of contract and should be putting those $200 a month away for a payment. \n\nUnless she\u2019s doing a STEM degree where she really does need a high powered laptop.", "YTA....Having 2K doesn't mean you can refinance a car.\n\nAlsp, your divorce decree wouldn't stand up in court.  You can't require someone to do something that may not be possible for them.", "I n f o: did you actually think you might have been hacked, or did you suspect it was her using her own money but cancel it to be petty? And what are your legal agreements regarding getting your name off the loan?\n\nTbh this sounds like to contentious of a divorce for you two to be communicating about the serious financial stuff without lawyers involved\n\nEdit: per ops reply NTA. You cancelled a purchase that you thought was fraudulent. And she's ta for not refinancing and for basically ignoring that part of the divorce agreement. Tho op if you're serious about getting your name off that loan I'd be taking legal action on it in your shoes cause I don't think ex wife will do it on her own", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

They will not do this.  That would be stealing property from her.  Maybe if she stopped paying on it, but otherwise, they will not do that.", "You can take her back to court if you want because she\u2019s breaking the contract and you did what you were supposed to and held up your end", "Except school means she is trying to up her earning potential", "A judge \u201cshould\u201d and \u201ccould\u201d enforce it. But it\u2019s not some simple \u201cshe didn\u2019t do it\u201d and a judge goes \u201cseize the car today!\u201d\n\nSo unless OP proves some significant hardship this is causing him (ie has actually paperwork from a home purchase mortgage that is declined specifically citing that the reason it\u2019s declined is his debt to income ratio) she\u2019s going to get another 90 days. \n\nAnd the fact he waited 6 months to complain, and only did so AFTER this laptop thing will show he\u2019s just being spiteful which isn\u2019t going to earn him any brownie points in his \u201ctake her car Now\u201d argument.", "No, he says it has impacted his credit.  Unless she isn't making payments, it isn't messing it up.", "Yeah, like maybe trading in her 2020 vehicle for an older one?", "He can't \"just get his name off.\"\n\nThat's not how joint and several liability works. It doesn't matter if there's a court order if she cannot refinance, because banks aren't under that order.\n\nIf that's the case, they need to request a hearing and reallocate this asset, but the court cannot force the finance company to remove his name on a debt he legally incurred.", "If she cared, she wouldn't have fucked OP's best friend. She's not going to do shit until there is some sort of figurative gun to her head. If I were OP, I'd get a copy of the title and sell the car.", "Sounds like she isn't able to refinance.", "What OP said was literally, in the literal sense of the word literally, about the car loan.", "It isn't up to the original finance company. She can go to any finance company. She shouldn't have taken the car in the divorce if she wasn't able to meet the obligations of taking it.", "Thank you!!!!!!! The amount of people that have this in their divorce decree that it takes months if not years to actually accomplish is astounding for this exact reason.", "That...that....just.....sounds.....like a personal failure.", "Done", "He's saying that the person that said YTA is your ex-wife. The person saying YTA seems to be way more on your wife's side than being objective", "Sorry, I didn't see that at first.", "Barring extreme scenarios like \"I need a workstation class laptop because I'm compiling millions of lines of code all day\", yes it absolutely will.\n\nHell, most decade old laptops are enough to get you through school.\n\nPractically everything students do nowadays is done through a web browser. If you're running a device that's modern enough to run a web browser, you'll be fine.", "Asset relocation and (recovery in the case it goes back to the dealership) happens all the time in court.", "She\u2019s going to HAIR school. I went to hair school. YOU DO NOT NEED A LAPTOP.", "How is that his problem?", "This is a morality sub, not a legal one. He is not an AH for his actions and ex is the AH", "The court can order that the ex sell the car and settle the loan to remove his name. They can\u2019t order the finance companies to do anything, but that\u2019s not the only solution here. The ex just wants to keep a car under terms she agreed to but can\u2019t actually afford.", "So both of you missed the point where there were other debts that were in both of their names BESIDES the car loan that she may be required to take him off of that she hasn't done yet? Was that not made evident by her comment about taking him off the credit card? Were you incapable of inferring that much from OP's message? Are you incapable of realizing my comment was in reference to MORE than just the car note?\n\nOr are you to concerned with \"literal\" only?", "They still have to approve her.  You can't court order someone to do something outside their control.  And there is no proof she isn't trying.", "That's not how asset allocation works. She can't just decide she can't afford the car and give it to him. \n\nIf she can't refinance, there are other options, but \"she shouldn't have taken it\" isn't one.", "A lot or people also assume if something is in a divorce decree it is legally binding, and that's not true.  A lot of things get added to contracts like this that the courts will not be able to enforce.", "That...makes...no...sense", "Yes, but not for this reason.", "Of course you do. \u201cHair school\u201d still has exams and lectures and notes tk take.", "It\u2019s not. He isn\u2019t paying for anything! It\u2019s costing him nothing. He cancelled it out of spite.", "I disagree. He is an AH for cancelling an order that was not on his credit card, just associated with his email account, for the stated reason that he\u2019s mad over non compliance on a car refinance.", "No, actually, they may not be able to do that.\n\nBecause if they're upside down, and they must be to need 10k to refinance, she can't legally sell the car unless she can pay off the remainder of the loan, that's how liens work. \n\nAnd since it's upside down, which we know because she needs 10k to refinance, that's unlikely. \n\nA divorce order has zero impact on the legal rights of the finance company.", "Sorry? When you used the vague pronoun \u201cit\u201d, I assumed you were referring to OP\u2019s quote in the post, which is yes, literally about the car loan.", "So then her remedy is to sell the car and pay off the loan so it's not in his name anymore. That's what the Court would order.", "I commented below similarly. Like OP and many others seem to think that if he calls a lawyer a judge will instantly repo her car. \n\nNot how it works\u2026\u2026..", "Lmfao I literally ended up with my ex wife's vehicle because she refused to get it registered or refinanced into her name. Try again", "It\u2019s in his name. Having a sizable car loan in your name (so sizable that she doesn\u2019t qualify to refinance it until she pays it down 10K) adversely affects credit, which costs money in interest rates and could mess up his ability to qualify for other credit. This is if she pays all the payments on time, which sounds unlikely if she\u2019s the type of person to spend $2500 on a gaming laptop when she has a $10k obligation  which is Court ordered that she hasn\u2019t met. She\u2019s in violation of the court order but decided to spend 25% of what it would cost to meet that obligation on a non-essential item.", "He said that he honestly thought that the account was hacked.", "There are other solutions including paying off the loan using other assets or paying off enough to refinance. Or, maybe she isn\u2019t underwater but just has awful credit. We don\u2019t know much about her situation and what the divorce settlement was.\n\nThe court can order a variety of things and the ex could provide a variety of evidence about impossibility and her attempts to comply. If ex is buying luxuries like gaming laptops on credit, it may not be very convincing unless she can truly show attempts.", "No, they wouldn't.  They'd just give her more time if she was making an attempt.", "And there is literally no proof she isn't trying.  She didn't refuse.  And registration is an entirely different beast.\n\nTry again.", "And went on further to make the car comment at her and asked specifically \u201cAITA for calling her out and cancelling the order?\u201d\n\nHad he just cancelled it, said \u201cyup, thought it was fraud\u201d and went about his day (which may have included a separate email reminding about the car) my judgement would have been different.", "Oh, I completely agree - there are ABSOLUTELY avenues to take, and all roads point to legal. \n\nJust to be clear, I don't disagree with your premise at all, I just think a lot of commenters are making it sound a bit simpler than it is.", "She\u2019s six months overdue and doesn\u2019t seem to have made any headway on paying down the loan so she would qualify to refinance it and just spent $2500 on a gaming laptop. I don\u2019t think a judge would consider that a good faith effort.", ">Had he just cancelled it, said \u201cyup, thought it was fraud\u201d and went about his day\n\nUntil the ex messaged him, that was what was happening. She started this by ordering on his account", "Nope, none of that proves anything.  And she has been making her monthly payments which is paying down the loan.  Refinancing has to do with more than the money you have on hand.", "Is this the OP on a different account?\n\nYes, I read the story. I comprehend what she did. What is subjective is if she did it accidentally or spitefully - the world may never know. \n\nBut OP had a choice. He could have handled it by saying what I said in my last comment, or what he actually did, which was to \u201ccall her out\u201d about the car. Which makes me believe he knew more than he admits to and realized that a pink laptop, purchased on a card that was not his, is more likely than not an over site by his ex wife logging into the incorrect account.", "Reread the OP - she hasn\u2019t refinanced it because she doesn\u2019t qualify for a loan in the amount that is currently owed on the car, the finance company told her to get the car in her own name she would have to pay down the loan by 10K first because her credit and income do not qualify her to refinance that amount without a co- signer. Six months has gone by and rather than attempt to pay down the loan to where she can refinance it she\u2019s spending money on a gaming laptop.", "Wtf? Just because someone disagrees with you doesn't mean they are doing some sneaky account switching shit\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>is more likely than not an over site by his ex wife logging into the incorrect account.\n\nYou're obviously just trying to defend the ex here. She didn't make an \"oversight\" by logging into the wrong account. She just couldn't be assed to make a new account and decided to cannibalise OP's."]}
