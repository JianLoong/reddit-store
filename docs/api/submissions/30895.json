If it was the entire class except Adam invited that'd be different but its clearly not. Kids on the spectrum being excluded from things is a very real issue and i wish all the best for Adam, but Adam's mum has no right to demand he be invited to the parties of kids he isn't friends with, thats not going to help him forge social bonds thats just gonna make the other kids resent him.", "NTA, no one is entitled to any invites, on the spectrum or not. I really don't see how him being on the spectrum changes anything honestly", "I had the opposite mum at one of my sons parties . She aggressively stopped me at school and asked if it was a pity invite.   Her son has down syndrome.    The entire class adored him.   I had to convince her that he was the 4th or 5th name on sons list out of 20.   Sometimes can't win  whatever you do.", "Very easy NTA.  It's your son's birthday party and HIS choice.  End of story.", "NTA \nIt\u2019s incredibly rude to try to invite yourself or kid to someone\u2019s event.", "NTA. \n\nHe\u2019s 13, not 5. He should be able to invite who he wants.", "NTA It's unfortunate for Adam, but your son doesn't happen to be friends with him and so the invite would be solely because of his mother's interference. I can understand her point of view and her wanting to expand Adam's range of social activities, but you are not an AH or a \"bad person\" for not forcing your son to invite classmates who are not his friends to his party. She should have taken the \"no\" graciously and left it at that. She is lashing out unfairly.", "NTA.  \n\nHer son\u2019s being on the spectrum does not entitle her to try and force an invitation.  Your so gets to pick who comes to his party.  The only other people who have a say here are you, his parents.", "NTA. It's HIS birthday, his special day, he should be the one to choose who he spends it with. He shouldn't invite someone he doesn't want there.", "Absolutely NTA! I don\u2019t understand where ANY parent gets off begging other parents to force their kids to be friends with their kids. It\u2019s so out of line!!! \n\nHope your son has the very best birthday with his friends!! What a cool idea for a party!!!", "NTA. As long as it\u2019s not the whole class except Adam, no worries.", "NTA, I get where she\u2019s coming from, kids on the spectrum have less friends, and wouldn\u2019t get invited as much. Issue is, kids on the spectrum, to a kid that young, are just \u201cweird\u201d, and he\u2019d be reasonably excluded from conversations if he was there. It\u2019s much better if he\u2019s not, but it\u2019s very understandable that she\u2019d be upset.", "NTA \n\nI don't really see how him being on the spectrum has anything to do with it and it was crappy of the mom to use that as a way of trying to get him an invite.", "NTA", "NTA.", "NTA, like everybody else is saying nobody is entitled to anything. But I do think this is a good opportunity to discuss neurodivergence with your son, what it means fully, how those on the spectrum or with any other form of disability may face ostracization, and how your son may encounter it in the future. Maybe after his party so he doesn\u2019t feel guilted into anything", "NTA\n\nThis is a tough one but you did tell your son he could invite who he wanted.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It\u2019s your sons birthday, he should have who he wants to have there.", "NTA OP and good on you respecting your son's right and wish to invite whoever he feels comfortable at his own party. You did the right thing not forcing your son to invite people he is not familiar with. \n\nAs for Adam's mum, she is on the wrong trying to demand that her son be invited to parties he is not invited to. She is not doing him any favours but she is setting her own child to be resented by other kids\n\nDon't let anyone tell you otherwise and stand your ground", "NTA  \n\nAs a fellow Adam who is also on the spectrum (ADHD side), nooooooo not Aduardo! You gotta learn to be funny if you are constructed alternatively or you won't get invited to shit. Start rehearsing those punchlines Adam or it's going to be a lonely time.", "Sadly, parents like this think they are doing their kid a favour by forcing their way into parties, etc. (both kids on the spectrum and kids that aren't) \n\nBut when they weren't invited to hang out, etc. They will often be treated like that. \"Oh yeah. We gotta talk to him/her, too.\" \nAnd be less talked to in school. \nTalk to a parent or two. Instead and arrange something yourself and have kids come hang out and get to know your kid, or let them form natural friendships in school. Help them how to navigate social situations. \n\nOf course, if it's an everyone in class is invited but yours. Then, you should advocate for your kid. \nBut sometimes it's sadly a parents fault they aren't invited. Because no one wants to deal with said parent.", "I work with adults with disabilities, and an elderly gent with downs I used to work with (passed early in the pandemic), knew everyone in the area - we'd be walking somewhere, and suddenly there'd be someone calling his name, come over to chat for a bit, etc. He was a funny dude and he loved entertaining the masses, as well as being a really nice man, so he was Mr. Popular.", "Glad that he was at the top of the list but mom is just worried about her kid.  Doesn\u2019t want her son to be made fun of or for other kids to be hostile that mom forced them to invite him.", "What is tough about this one?  Telling some entitled mother who calls and demands an invite for her son to a child's birthday party?  That entitled mother is clearly TA and there is no question about it.", "Nice.  I worked at a not for profit before pandemic,  Lachlan was our favourite volunteer. Sweet adorable helpful and vulnerable young man living with downs.", "My thought going to the idea of if the kid was the only classmate not invited to the party. That was it, but reading the post a few times made it clear that it wasn't the case. That's all.\n\nYeah, the mom is def TA. But I didn't so much think about her than the kid involved. It sucks for Adam, that he's not invited and I was thinking of his situation rather than his mother."]}
