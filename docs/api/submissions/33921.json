But it\u2019s going to be difficult for your sister, and possibly your husband, to believe that your response was completely innocent. They have feelings about the people involved that are going to complicate this. So take a deep breath, try not to panic, and drop the expectation that this can be fixed immediately. A bomb just went off in your sister\u2019s marriage and she is not likely to be levelheaded while she\u2019s assessing the damage. Give her space and focus on your own. You and your husband need to be aligned on this, he needs to believe you *completely*, because otherwise there\u2019s almost no chance your sister will ever do so. If your own marriage is solid and you and your husband are calm and consistent in your defense, then there\u2019s a chance your sister will eventually be convinced of your innocence. \n\nBut for now, things are going to be uncomfortable.

Unless the sister apologizes, keep distance from her and him. Block him on insta. \nObviously something is wrong in their relationship and she is projecting.

Your sister has misplaced anger and should really be mad at her husband for making inappropriate comments to her sister.

Those of you who are blaming her equally or even entirely for her responses do not understand that often, a woman's first line of defense is to 'laugh it off' or play dumb. This is to avoid confrontation, it is NOT to encourage further interaction. If a man interprets this defense mechanism as flirting, that truly is pure arrogance and ignorance. \n\nPutting myself in the SIL shoes, I would have zero problem with OP trying awkwardly to deflect and would be entirely mortified at my husband for his behaviour.

Essentially I think you're right that those emojis on their own aren't flirty in the way that e.g. \ud83e\udd75 is, but for me (and presumably OP's sister) in context of the rest of the conversation and how obviously it looks like BIL is being horny at her, it feels like \ud83d\ude05 and \ud83e\udee3 are portraying that sort of playful... bashfulness? that can be a part of flirting, when it feels like it might have been more appropriate to either reply unplayfully or not reply at all. The laughing emojis feels (in this reading) like a positive reaction to what he's saying, and since what he's saying looks pretty unambiguously like a come on, a positive reaction seems inappropriate.\n\nSomething like 'omg I called a customer mum today \ud83d\ude02\ud83e\udee3' is playful and relationship-building and making light of being embarrassed in an appropriate colleague way, but when it's \"your skirt is so tiny \ud83e\udd75\" \"it\u2019s not that short \ud83d\ude02\ud83e\udee3\", also can come across as playful and relationship-building and making light of being embarrassed, but in a context that has already been set by the \ud83e\udd75 emoji and conversation's context as horny and flirty.\n\nBut like I said, that was my initial perspective, genuinely happy to go with the fact that that's not the only perspective and OP may well have not been seeing the reading that me, strawberryfae and her sister got.

He can say that it\u2019s not his fault she took it that way, he was commenting as an older brother figure trying to urge her to put on a longer skirt, and claim that it doesn\u2019t make sense for him to try and hit on her on a public platform like that. That way if she voices her concerns over this comment that *could,* in some universe, have been innocent and just very, very oblivious, and his wife ends up taking his side, OP loses credibility in the future if he ever crosses another boundary. Speaking up after one event, especially with a family member and in a public setting, gets a lot of women labeled as the girl who cried wolf and makes it harder to be believed next time. \n\nIt\u2019s a really tricky situation to navigate by design and I honestly don\u2019t know what OP could have said (other than not responding) that would have shut it down without giving him an opportunity to make her look bad.", "Victim? Relax mate", "Ohhh. so you were reading it like he was a father figure getting mad at your clothing choices and he was being protective?", "You did\u2019t do anything AH like. At worst a bit bad at reading his intentions through the question and emotes, but that isn\u2019t a crime. \n\nYour sister seriously needs to grow up and realise that her trust issues with her husband isn\u2019t your fault and that if it\u2019s so bad that you can\u2019t have a text conversation with your BIL then their marriage probably isn\u2019t worth salvaging.", "where did I do that?", "I took a couple of screenshots for you - [just here](https://imgur.com/a/lXCaKWJ) :).", "Or we could just, I dunno, take the person who wrote the messages WORD for it that they weren\u2019t flirting. I don\u2019t understand all this speculation when we have OP\u2019s account which was that she was most definitely not flirting.", "You lack reading comprehension. Or you misread what Emojis she used because his were flirty but hers were not. To me it's like flashing lights neon sign OBVIOUS that she's either uncomfortable and deflecting or clueless bc she's known him since she was 9 and only sees him as a big brother and didn't even catch that he's being creepy.", "I agree the OP should've gone about it differently but at the end of the day it was a married sexually harrassing his sister in law who he knows she since she was 9. Unfortunately, a lot of women blame their partner's targets (whether they accept the flirting or not) and not their partner for flirting/cheating", "The top post decides, I believe, but typing the letters with no spaces is your vote if you end up on top as it is done by bot. In contest mode, it is hard to say who will end up on top, but older posts are more likely.", "She was trying to shut him down, she just wasn\u2019t good at setting a hard boundary.  She told him with the emojis that it was an embarrassing discussion.  He kept pushing.", "I really think it was OP trying to stay friendly and just move past the comments. I don\u2019t expect everyone to be able to tell their BIL to fuck off directly. OP tried to change the subject and BIL brought it up again.\n\nAs a woman, this is pretty similar to how I would respond to comments like these. OP obviously was answering as if she was uncomfortable and just trying to move on from it. It is hard to so directly shut down a man who is saying stuff like this because you don\u2019t know if they will immediately take it to being defensive/gaslighting you into thinking that\u2019s not what he meant.", "A man 10 hrs her senior hits on her like a pervert and she\u2019s the asshole?? Ok bye boy", "I see what you mean, and I do agree, it *could* be perceived as such, but I keep having in mind how OP said BIL is like a big brother to her, so while it *could* have been a playful bashfulness, it did not necessarily have to be flirty. \n\nLike I said in another comment, if I received such a message from my stepfather (as he is the only non-biological family that I have and talk to more than once a year), I would want to give him the benefit of the doubt, but I would be uncomfortable and try to make a lighthearted comment and redirect the convo to a different topic, and just ignore if he kept going. \n\nI can see why some people think OP was flirting back, but it doesn't change the fact that BIL made an inappropriate comment unprompted and that OP was not reciprocating the sentiment. :)", "\"Smirk\" is \"when you achieved something great and can't wait to talk about it\"? LMAO. What possibly all the men that send it to me have achieved, then? Sent an opener message? \n\nSmiley with a cowboy hat has a meaning - as opposed to what the list says. \n\nI have more comments, but I'm gonna save them. Clearly the creator and people I know are not hanging around in similar circles.", "Because there was a comment where she said he was like an older brother to her so she was taking it basically like he was getting onto her for her skirt being too short not like he was perving on it", "She was trying to deflect. She said her skirt isn't that short and then tried to change the conversation by asking about a restaurant. How is that playing along?", "She was very obviously trying to deflect without outright calling BIL out. The latter can very easily end poorly for women which is why they resort to nervous laughter or deflection.", "Did you miss the part about her being married, which he's aware of as he's friends with her husband, and him being married to her sister? Cus if that don't make him a creep in your books then I dunno what does.", "Such BS blaming the woman for the man\u2019s inappropriate commentd", "From outside perspective it seems flirty from his perspective, and creeped out from hers.", "No, from my outside perspective it only sounds flirty from him", "I mean, if she was reading it from a protective point of view, like your father would get onto you for saying your skirt is too short I could see where she would think that since she was so young when they met and he was always like a big brother to her. The dynamic is just not the same.", "You would fit in quite well with the internet janitors.  Removing dissenting opinions is their favorite pastime.", "Thanks!  I thought you meant all the ones OP used and I wanted to make sure the other ones were innocent, since I actually use some of them.", "I could quite easily make a post and spin it slightly in my favor", "Me three.", "Look at her other posts. She\u2019s all about male attention.", "There\u2019s room to blame both people. Him, for being a creep, and her for not shutting it down or simply not responding. She\u2019s an adult woman nearing 30, not a 9 year old.", "Ooo I didn't know that! Thank you, I'll amend \ud83d\ude0a", "That doesn't mean the concept doesn't hold true. The issue with the Nazis sitting at a table is that they don't speak up. That's the point. You are never too young to learn that it's important to speak up against things. I'm not trying to put all of the blame on her, I'm saying that not speaking up isn't helping anything. I agree that the BIL is the biggest creep in this circumstance and it's ultimately his fault for starting this. I'm not trying to blame op as if it were her fault. It wasn't at all. But she does need to learn how to speak up if this sort of thing happens again, like we all do/should. That's not victim blaming, that's explaining that if something inappropriate happens, you need to try and say something. I'm sure she had her reasons for not saying anything, but that doesn't mean she shouldn't speak up in the future.", "*Girl. Assuming only boys would disagree with you on this, eh? Says a lot about you. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nAlso, she\u2019s 26, not 13. He flirted, she responded in a flirty way. Don\u2019t cheapen the word \u201cvictim\u201d by applying it here when the only one who was truly wronged is her sister.", "Ok, so the list is garbage. You're right. \n\nIn your professional opinion, did she use the correct emojis to most adequately communicate her discomfort over the \"tiny skirt\" conversation?", "A guy she\u2019s known since she was 9. He\u2019s the creep.", "This isn't real though. Check her profile.", "well in the comments she claims she didnt realized he was being flirty and she also didnt tell her sister, so.......", "thats why she should have shut it down and tell his wife", "Nothing you said was an opinion.", "It's called deflection. She was trying to move away from him commenting about her appearance.\n\nBut it's fake anyway, so go rage elsewhere.", "Oh, forreal?", "The concept is way different because you aren\u2019t taking into account the pressure she was put under by a creep. She isn\u2019t wrong for not saying something or an AH for not saying something. It isn\u2019t her responsibility to put the creep in his place.", "Women very often are raised to gently deflect creepy behavior -- either because women are supposed to be nice or because it can be dangerous not to. Even when you *know* the man isn't a physical threat, it can be hard to undo behavior that has been ingrained in you all your life.", "Ah yes, the typical \"let's ask very pointed questions\" tactic. \n\nNo, she did not. She, however, did not do anything wriong by trying to de-escalate (for a lack of better word atm, English is not my first language) it in a light-hearted manner. A lot women (including me) would do the same.", "Eww. Definitely a creep.", "In what way does her profile tell you this isn't real?", "And also stated he's like a big brother to her. \n\nI also didn't realize people were flirting with me until after someone else told me, before i (autistic person) started studying romantic social interactions. \n\nI would def not expect a message like that from my stepfather (as that is the only non-bio family i talk to frequently), but if i got one, i'd respond hinting to drop it - no, not say it out straight. \n\nTook me half a year to block a creepy guy, just because we were sort-of-kinda buddies, that's how ingrained we (women) have to just endure shit.\n\nEta: half a year AND at least half of that time being encouraged to do it", "She did shut it down! Read the room!!!", "IMO she was flirting. People here seem to disagree with my opinion so I call it an opinion unless you believe I\u2019m so correct that it\u2019s fact..", "I am taking that into account. You still need to try and push back against creeps, even if it's hard. You think Nazis weren't pressured into being Nazis? You think Hitler wasn't a creep? The concept is the same... If somebody is being a creep then you shut it down. AH may have been too strong a term, but she still should try in the future to shut that kind of behavior down. If nothing else, I just hope that is her takeaway here, because that BIL sucks.", "The fact that it's full of hotwife stories and links to an Onlyfans competitor. Or do you think she really did wear an extremely revealing dress to Christmas to get her father to respect her while her husband groped her publicly? \n\nWhat a coincidence there's pictures of this \"tiny\" skirt mentioned in this post, too! Though with a more salacious accompanying story!\n\nIt's about as clear of a porn account as there is.\n\nAlso, if you think this is real, you may be interested in the other \"totally real\" context in her posts where she talks about going to nude beaches as a couples date with sister & BIL lol", "did she tell her sister?", "Yeah, for you.", "Omg it\u2019s THAT sister.", "Not sure it\u2019s an equal comparison. Women have a lot of concern and fear rightly so for standing up to creeps it\u2019s really not that easy. Hopefully the sister places the blame where it rightly deserves at the husband", "And have her sister accuse her all the same?", "And many others who commented the same thing lol", "You're acting like I don't know these things, which I understand because you do not know me as a person, but I am not disagreeing with you at all. I am a woman myself and understand the struggles that we have to go through with creepy men. I agree that the brother-in-law is the biggest issue here, and that was my point. He is the issue and his attitude needs to be pushed back against. The sister absolutely should put the blame on him, but I can also understand why she might be disappointed that her sister didn't even come to her with this information when it happened. I'm not just hating on OP. I'm saying you can't give creeps like an inch or they'll take advantage.", "I feel like if the sister was really concerned about OP she would have had a kind discussion and said hey my husband was way out of line and you know you can always come to me with something that makes you feel uncomfortable. Instead she went off on her in a voice mail"]}
