But it\u2019s going to be difficult for your sister, and possibly your husband, to believe that your response was completely innocent. They have feelings about the people involved that are going to complicate this. So take a deep breath, try not to panic, and drop the expectation that this can be fixed immediately. A bomb just went off in your sister\u2019s marriage and she is not likely to be levelheaded while she\u2019s assessing the damage. Give her space and focus on your own. You and your husband need to be aligned on this, he needs to believe you *completely*, because otherwise there\u2019s almost no chance your sister will ever do so. If your own marriage is solid and you and your husband are calm and consistent in your defense, then there\u2019s a chance your sister will eventually be convinced of your innocence. \n\nBut for now, things are going to be uncomfortable.

Unless the sister apologizes, keep distance from her and him. Block him on insta. \nObviously something is wrong in their relationship and she is projecting.

You were not untoward with the conversation that took place on your HUSBANDS Inst account. You didn't start a conversation with a married man. Those who have condemned you as TA, clearly have their own issues that has dictated that you and ONLY you were in the wrong.\n\nI do not think you were in the wrong for the convo, however it is a huge red flag that a man you have looked upon as a big brother for 17 years, suddenly starts making inappropriate comments to you.

You really need thicker skin if something like that has you crying to the point of not being able to defend yourself.\n\nI know it's difficult in the moment to do so, but you really should've shut him down when he commented on your skirt.  Your sister has misplaced anger and should really be mad at her husband for making inappropriate comments to her sister.

Those of you who are blaming her equally or even entirely for her responses do not understand that often, a woman's first line of defense is to 'laugh it off' or play dumb. This is to avoid confrontation, it is NOT to encourage further interaction. If a man interprets this defense mechanism as flirting, that truly is pure arrogance and ignorance. \n\nPutting myself in the SIL shoes, I would have zero problem with OP trying awkwardly to deflect and would be entirely mortified at my husband for his behaviour.

She knows the expectations in a marriage and can think outside herself and have empathy for how her sister would feel. And her sister seeing the messages maybe wasn\u2019t ready to directly talk to her sister. She probably should have discussed it first but when it by all appearances looks that your sister is flirting with your husband, reason isn\u2019t the first place a brain can go", "She may have just wanted to get all of her thoughts out in one message before having a back and forth. She probably wasn't ready for what her husband and sister were talking about and was shook when she found out. I would be.\n\nIt doesn't necessarily mean that she was avoiding speaking to her sister and it sounds like they did continue to speak. Just because it was a voice message doesn't mean much. I've known plenty of people who use voice message over actual text because they find it easier. We don't know the whole situation but I wouldn't blame the older sister for being upset at the actions of her husband and her sister. They were both married adults that should have known better to begin with.", "You're assumption she was flirting doesn't mean she was lol", "Exactly!", "Wait till her sister learns that. I'm gonna buy a truck of popcorn and wait for an update", "I'm not comparing anybody to a Nazi here, so it's not misused. I'm using it as an example because it's true that if you don't say anything then you're not helping anyone. The concept is something we all need to remember for everything we do, not just specific to Nazis. I agree that it's an extremely important concept, but it also works on all levels. To show we need to speak up when something isn't right. Don't contribute further to the issue by allowing it to happen.", "Um yes???!!! In this context, when someone is clearly flirting with you and you reply with nervous sweating emoji it\u2019s exactly that, \u2018nervous sweating because you\u2019re hitting on me and I\u2019m nervous but like it\u2019s - it\u2019s not even reaching, it\u2019s obvious", "You think that doesn't cause trouble either?\n\nI don't think her emojis were borderline flirty unless she's someone who never uses emojis in general.\n\nThe whole tone of this posts responses have been \" You asked for it for wearing a short skirt\" and it's exceptionally gross. Don't think for a second you aren't part of it with your \" She should have done this, she should have done that.\"", "OP did not respond \"kindly\". She, like most women, is just so used to men being inappropriate and being expected to tolerate and accommodate them, that she failed to even regisyer the brother-in-law's comment as inappropriate. And she is now angry at her sister for being upset. If you want to talk about internalized misogyny.", "It leaves us in a place where we tell OP to calm down, understand that her sister is likely hurt because from her point of view OP seemed to be making light of her husband's inappropriate behaviour and talk to her sister about how the interaction seemed harmless and funny from OP's point of view. Instead of validating OP being angry at her sister because how dare she!", "The \"No it doesn't\" is replying to the previous comment saying \"flirty on both ends\".\n\nThat emoji was sent by the BIL, not OP.", "News to me... I've only seen it to portray embarrassment", "See no evil is used to show embarrassment.", "Wait, the see no evil emoji is used for flirting? I always use it as an \"I'm embarrassed\" kind of emoji", "Ban this fool. incredibly stupid.", "It doesn't matter.  \n\n\nMarried man hitting on another married woman is a creep.", "He's telling her it's tiny. She's saying it's not. It may be flirting on his end, but how is that flirting on hers? You have to also consider intention. This is her BIL and she's trying to be nice and not assume the worst. She's assuming he's joking around, not flirting with her.", "It's not just my assumption. It's the assumption of many people here and, most importantly, her sister. You don't engage with guys talking about your short skirt unless you're flirting, and you certainly don't use the emojis she did and continue the conversation like she did.", "I think the sister is already a bit uncomfortable, she talks about going topless around the BIL at the beach before.", "This conflict with her sister isn't real. This post is low effort spam to drive traffic to her MYM", "Did you read the OP? She didn't know she was being flirted with at the time. You can't just make up your own facts.\n\nY'all thirsty boys will interpret anything as flirting, won't you?", "The \u201c\ud83e\udd75\u201d emoji immediately indicates flirting. If your BIL begins flirting with you, the conversation ends there and you contact your sibling. You don\u2019t keep sending other emojis back.", "Look at the post history...", "Um she's a hotwife so fucks dudes outside the marriage to brag to her husband...", "You're being purposely ignorant lol, there isn't a situation in the world where a BIL should send a panting emoji to their SIL, the panting emoji literally means 'so hot I'm panting' ...", "\u201cIt\u2019s not that tiny \ud83d\ude02\ud83e\udee3\u201d - the emojis cross it into flirty for sure.", "So the sister does know about OP posting on hotwife sub?", "I\u2019m a 42 yr old woman, but sure. To be clear, BIL is the one in the absolute wrong but OP definitely didn\u2019t help by engaging him like that", "Doesnt matter. Going off of this post.", "You could easily say that to a friend and it not be interpreted as flirting. It needs to go beyond that for it to truly be flirting, or it needs to have obvious intention. I don't believe OP wanted to flirt with her BIL.", "Looks like a story of the sister being mad OP went topless in front of them.", "Maybe, but it reads as flirty to me if you consider what she\u2019s replying to."]}
