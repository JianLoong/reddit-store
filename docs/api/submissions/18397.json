Where they wanted to go to an ivy league but parents say no because it's too much money. Or did they want to go to the state school and happen to get the scholarship.  \n\nIf OP never had intentions on going to an ivy league school. Their parents aren't treating their brother \"special\". They're treating him differently because is circumstances are different", "Except they apparently have always treated him differently so it wouldn\u2019t matter. Note brother got a car at 16 and OP based on not stating they did did not. OP was told when they were an adult they were responsible for themselves. Brother  sos not get this talk and parents are placing that on OP. Ivy League, state or HVAC the school doesn\u2019t matter because they were told growing up not at college time that there would be no support. They expect support to be provided now for brother.", "That's why my first question that OP never answered was if their parents financial situation is different now. \n\nLet's say one of OP parents was a SAHP when was 16 and couldn't afford to get them a car. Now they both work and have more income, so they can afford their brother a car.  \n\nThat's why I asked my questions because there could a reason why they being raised differently That's not \"they like him more\"", "And its still irrelevant to college because they aren\u2019t offering to pay.  They are demanding OP so their financial status does not matter."]}
