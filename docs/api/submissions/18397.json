Instead it seemed you were unhappy that your parents treat you and your brother differently (which absolutely does suck, let's be real). \n     If you and your brother get along, and you have the means to help him, then doing so is a great idea. If not (to either) then don't. Either way, put your parents -and their agenda- aside. \n\nTLDR; regardless you are NTA.

But if you get on well with him and can afford to help but won't because your parents suck, consider that your (albeit justified!) fight with your parents might well hurt your brother more than it does them.\nEither way, favouritism is awful and I'm sorry you've been going through it!", "NTA and you are right you don\u2019t have to sacrifice to help any adult.. especially two that are supposed to treat siblings the same.

NTA nonetheless :)", "So let\u2019s tackle this one by one: \n\nStarting with B) right or wrong advice is still advice\u2026 sure but by that definition everything succeeds.\n\u201eHey I am struggling to lose weight any advice.\u201c\n\u201eYeah sure the answer lies at the bottom of this bag of M&Ms.\u201c Right or wrong it is objectively an advice.\n\nI believe we all are trying to give good advices and so it is important to listen to the people stating their problem and not manifest our own opinions onto them. \nI can give plenty of advices that follow known general facts and use them apply them to every vaguely similar scenario but still do not in any shape or form help the person asking for advice in that moment.\nTo make this clear there have been plenty of cases where the one child being a girl and the other a boy was the reason for the parents behaviour but that doesn\u2019t make it always the right answer. \n\nIt\u2018s a motive you say:\nA motive would be to establish a clear intend behind actions. \nA motive thereby would be to say you being a girl is the reasons why your parents didn\u2019t support you with money during your studies.\nIt is however not usuable in this case as the question is if OP is in the wrong for not helping his/her sibling. \nThe motive for their action is clearly the parents not being able to pay for the tuition fees themselves.\nWhat the comment was now doing is building up a backstory and a narrative to be able to strengthen their conclusion. \nHer being a woman does not change the intend of the parents it is not a motive and it also wasn\u2019t a fact. Because facts are how we establish motives.\nIt is an additional argument that could underline the problem even further but that\u2018s it.\n\nRead the comment I made, in which I btw arrived at the same conclusion and you see that Intried to answer the question OP asked and tried to avoid bringing in any personal beliefs.\nI hope I was able to get my argument across.\n\nIn the end sadly it doesn\u2019t matter the comment is flashy and will get upvotes because people don\u2019t care about these necessary distinctions and can only see things in black and white. \nFor them I am disagreeing with the comments basic message (which I am not) for deeming it wrong under these circumstances and that is just sad to be honest.", "It's irrelevant to you but it isn't to me.\n\nHere's the thing OP not and AH but I'm trying to figure out if their parents are. \n\nIf they got their brother a car simply because they have more income that's not them \"favoring\" him. It's just that they are more financially stable now. \n\nIf OP never got accepted to an ivy league school, they have no idea how their parents would have reacted if they did.  \n\nLastly they asked OP to help not demand that they pay it all.  I don't find it absurd to ask your well off child, to help their sibling go to one of the top schools in the country. \n\nNow I get your mind was made up after reading this. Mine wasn't.

It\u2019s making the choice that they have $X extra available to spend, and spending all of it on one child. They don\u2019t need to buy him a car. They could, for example, spend the money on a family vacation to include all of their children. They could split $X among all of their children, to put towards whatever they need/want. \n\nThe only circumstances in which I would say that it wouldn\u2019t be favoritism to get one child a car when you did not do the same for their older sibling(s) would be if circumstances necessitated them having a car in a way that was not the case with the older sibling(s). For example, if the family lived in an area with excellent public transport when the older sibling(s) was/were teenager(s) but moved to the back of beyond when the younger sibling was a teenager.", "How would the parents not be AHs? Read the post, it's very clearly said that the parents want the youngest kid to go into an Ivy school but can't afford it and want OP to pay for it instead.\n\nThey said a state school the younger sibling got a fully funded scholarship for is not good enough even tho op was forced to do one because he had no other option.\n\nIdk but in both cases if their financial situation changed or not they still demanded OP to pay for his brother college when he never got anything since OP was 15 yo, they don't want the brother to get any debt nor do they want debt themself but have no issues in possibly having OP go into debt."]}
