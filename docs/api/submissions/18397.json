Instead it seemed you were unhappy that your parents treat you and your brother differently (which absolutely does suck, let's be real). \n     If you and your brother get along, and you have the means to help him, then doing so is a great idea. If not (to either) then don't. Either way, put your parents -and their agenda- aside. \n\nTLDR; regardless you are NTA.

But if you get on well with him and can afford to help but won't because your parents suck, consider that your (albeit justified!) fight with your parents might well hurt your brother more than it does them.\nEither way, favouritism is awful and I'm sorry you've been going through it!", "NTA and you are right you don\u2019t have to sacrifice to help any adult.. especially two that are supposed to treat siblings the same.
