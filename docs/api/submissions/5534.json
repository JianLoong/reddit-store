My daughter also just turned 6 and she would absolutely understand. She would also respect a \"no\" (I even have unicorn stickers that are mine, because I'm going to use them for homemade activity books for her in the future, and she respects that even though she loves unicorns and stickers), but I think in this case the explanations would help niece understand that this is not about aunt not wanting to share a toy. Unless of course niece is already too entitled to care.", "I had a lot of problems with anxiety and overstimulation as a kid. I had meltdowns fairly regularly, but I never threw tantrums. My mom would always soothe me when I had a meltdown, but she would ignore me if I tried to throw a tantrum. There is no reason why parents should encourage poor behavior", "A friend once 'let' me hold her infant son. He was in my lap. I worked graveyard, it was past my bedtime - and I fell asleep.\n\nI get those spastic, whole-body twitches when I fall asleep. Guess who got thrown on the floor? \n\nNever asked me to hold anymore of her 8 subsequent babies.", "NTA, kids need to learn that when other people say no, they mean it. Nip entitlement in the bud early.", "NTA\n\nIts something you use to a medical issue.", "NTA. You\u2019re not causing the drama, your sister\u2019s parenting style is.", "NTA, kids parents need to fucking parent. So sick of em if you don't wanna do your job then don't have a kid.", "NTA\n\nNot everything is for sharing. Kids learn that by being taught, mom's job and mom's job to support her kiddo in hearing it from others.\n\nIf YOU want a gentler alternative, let your niece know that even though it LOOKS like a toy, it isn't. But if she wants to check it out, she can sit on your lap or sit with you and have a quiet cuddle. You need it to stay on your body, but she can join you if she's calm and gentle.", "NTA, I had a similar thing, it was a sheep with a cold/hot gel pack, something a rough kid would pop (also apparently pops when you nuke it for an extra 5 seconds \ud83d\ude11)", "NTA your sister is basically worshipping her child. It's sad, pathetic, and causes nothing but more entitled idiots. \n\nI'd say keep it up, you're being a good aunt, and teaching boundaries.", "NTA, this child needs to learn boundaries and that no means no.", "Definitely a recipe for broken windows or a black eye \ud83d\ude02"]}
