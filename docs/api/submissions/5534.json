Thank you.", "This was my thought. It is NOT a toy, it's a medical device. Everyone seemed to tip toe around that.", "This NTA", "Yep.

Singular \"they\" isn't exactly unprecedented.", "I dunno, I respect pronouns, so if most of the world thinks \"it\" is an offensive pronoun for a baby, I'm going to avoid saying that.
