My sister, Kate (29F), and her daughter, Bee (newly 6F), arrived a couple days ago right before the storm started. It is currently -20 Fahrenheit so nobody is going outside until it warms up. Bee was a handful before the storm rolled in and now that we're all stuck inside; it's only got worse.\n\nI don't do great in the cold. I have some issues with circulation in my limbs and to help combat it I have a variety of heating options at home. Because I had to travel a few hours to get here I only have a heated blanket that my parents provided, smaller electric heating pad, and a microwaveable stuffed dog. It isn't super easy to move around with the blanket or the pad so the past couple days I've been using the dog.\n\nLast night, my niece noticed that I had it on my lap while we decorated cookies and asked to play with it. I told her no and she got a bit whiny but we were able to redirect her so it was fine. Around bed time she asked again if she could have the dog, I told her no again and tried to explain that it's a special thing that helps me \"so I don't turn to ice\". She started having a meltdown. Kate asked what happened and I explained. She told me to just give up the dog to make Bee happy and use a heating pad instead. I told her I wasn't going to do that because I don't want to be using it later and have Bee think she's entitled to it because she wants to play. Kate said I was being selfish and that was that. \n\nThis morning, Bee was acting out at breakfast and told everyone it was because I was being mean to her and not sharing my \"toys\". I once again told her that it's something that helps me move, that's why she can't play with it. She had another meltdown and my sister is now giving me the cold shoulder. My parents are on my side but I feel like an asshole for causing drama at an already stressful time of year.", "created_utc": 1671893107, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zub7c0/aita_for_not_giving_my_niece_a_stuffed_animal/", "score": 137, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
