Long time lurker, second time poster.\n\nYesterday morning I was on a plane leaving my hometown back to the city i live in. I fly standby so i get the last the available seats on the plane. I was given a middle seat, but was grateful to have a seat at all. Once i get to my seat, I noticed i was seated between two ladies that very obviously knew each other and were friends traveling together. I interrupted the conversation so that I could sit down and once seated, they continued the conversation with me in the middle. I sat up, they would lean back, i would lean back, they would sit up. I started to get slightly annoyed and felt it was a little rude for them to be talking over me like that. i tried to just suck it up and put my airpods in with noise cancellation and the sound all the way up and could still hear them. I figured they wanted to sit together and there was no harm in asking, and politely asked if one of them wanted to switch so that they could sit next to each other. You would\u2019ve thought i called her mother a whore.

I got off the plane feeling very eh and slightly gaslit. \n\nI asked all of my people and they said i handled it completely right. but i can\u2019t shake the feeling that i should\u2019ve just suffered in silence. so, AITA?", "created_utc": 1692726196, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15ycy1q/aita_for_asking_to_switch_seats_on_a_plane/", "score": 66, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It was an open seating flight and I got stuck with the last boarding pass (due to delays and cancellations and usual travel snafus). I got stuck in the middle seat between two friends. I kept asking and asking if they wanted to move but nope. Neither wanted to sit in the middle seat so the talked across me (and showed each other things on their phone) the whole 5.5 hours. I eventually fell asleep. Hopefully I snored and annoyed them. \n\nOrdinarily I say people shouldn\u2019t have to change seats that they purchased, but in this case NTA. Their behavior is completely unhinged.", "NTA\n\nYou offering to swap seats was a polite way to handle rude behavior. They likely booked outer seats, hoping no one would book the center, and they'd have extra room without buying that seat. It didn't work out for them.", "You should have joined their conversation.

Who cares if they are texting about you and how did you know?", "Obviously NTA by this description but, honestly, it's difficult for me to imagine that this is how it actually went down. If you were really as polite as this telling of the story suggests, I simply cant imagine any reason that they wouldn't have simply taken you up on your offer or politely declined.

Any normal person would recognize that it's awkward to be in the middle of a conversation that they had nothing to do with.", "NTA", "Nta. You offered politely to switch and them talking over you is weird. I if I was split from a friend I would just talk\nTo her when we got off the plane.", "NTA. You asked politely. It's a fair question. Some people might've wanted to switch. You accepted no for an answer. They got defensive immediately because they knew they were being rude. They were upset because the person they were treating as an object spoke.", "NTA. My wife and I fly Southwest mostly which means we don\u2019t have assigned seats, and I have a service dog. We sit at the bulkhead as a result and when we sit, we leave the middle open. But if someone ends up needing the seat, whoever is on the aisle will shift to the middle so that we aren\u2019t talking over each other. And if one of us strikes up a conversation with the new person, that person switches to the middle. Even we don\u2019t want to listen to the other person talk over us!", "Nothing wrong with being optimistic about the row. My ridiculously tall other half always books aisle, I always book window. However, when someone sits between us, we shut up. We live together, we can go a few hours not speaking! \n\n\nOP is NTA and seems rather kind in offering to trade places.", "I do this, but then when someone sits in the middle seat, my job is to pretend the person I'm traveling with is a complete stranger. Talking over them is incredibly rude. Also, if they want to avoid the aisle and still chatter the whole flight, they can book seats across the aisle from each other.", "i do this every time, but the rule is if we do get a stranger in the middle, we offer them the aisle seat if they want it. if they say no (unlikely as it may be), we would never just physically talk over them.", "Honestly, if I'd offered to switch so they could talk and they were *that* rude about declining the offer, I'd join the conversation.\n\nYou offered a way to remove yourself and it was declined.  Clearly you were invited to take part at that point.  Ask a lot of clarifying questions, whip out a notepad to chart out who everyone was.  Take notes, offer commentary, and try to bring it all back to your favorite soap opera of the 90s (No way!! Claire who's married to Bryan is cheating on him with Jack? Well, when that happened on AMC, it ended Erica Kane's 12th marriage. Hope Bryan doesn't find out!).\n\nHell, get others involved. If they have no problem talking through you, I'm sure they won't have any issues with your relaying this information to the person across the aisle.\n\nBut maybe I'm just obnoxious.", "Yup. I've done this before but when I see that the plane is fully booked I move to the middle seat and the original person is normally relieved to not be in the middle. 100% they were hoping no one would sit there but neither wanted the middle. Which in my mind they both might as well have gotten an aisle seat across from each other.", "> \u201ci didn\u2019t know we couldn\u2019t talk on a plane\u201d\n\nYes lady, but I literally purchased this airspace and you are invading it right now.", "while it did, i\u2019m coming from a family trip in which i hadn\u2019t seen some of my family members in a year and a half. I was on a high from life and felt like nothing could take me off that", "shit i thought so too! sometimes i\u2019ll offer to switch when someone is freakishly tall and in the middle because i\u2019m very short and it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\ni really had no issue sitting in the middle if it was pure silence. Yeah, it\u2019s annoyin and uncomfortable but not to the point where id have to switch. this was rude tho imo", "i feel like it was definitely entitlement. they made me feel crazy for offering them to sit together. insane. like \u201chow dare you not want to be a physical barrier in our conversation?!??\u201d", "Right!!! Seemed to me like OP was doing them a favor by offering to switch seats.", "Because making OP feel bad was more fun for them.  When OP objected, by offering up their seat, their fun was spoiled, so they went to the next 'mean girl' step and texted furiously, making sure OP could see it.  Some people enjoy the misery of others.", "the behavior you experienced is unhinged!!! OMG WTF?!?? i didn\u2019t believe so either, but like cmon.", "are you fr rn?????", "no for two reasons: \n1) i am someones flight companion and anything can get me and my campanions benefits revoked\n2) nothing will ever take me out of character enough to be put on the no fly list", "This happened to me. The two ladies didn\u2019t want the middle seat, even if it meant having to lean over me for 5 hours. \n\nAnd OP earned the right to be brusk in this occasion, if they were.", "fair! for me, i was trying to make as little wave as possible knowing how this would turn out for me. i didn\u2019t think it was relevant but they are a different race than me.", "okay. so you sit in the middle of two people talking for a hr and a half flight and get back to me", "I don\u2019t agree about the \u2018YTA\u2019 but very much agree about the fast that this is not gaslighting.", "i think you\u2019re mistaken. I interrupted the conversation when i got to my seat to sit down because they were mid conversation. i lowkey thought it would end once i sat down. I went through texting all my people that i was boarded and awaiting takeoff and they were still talking. the back n forth came from me getting things out of my bag at my feet which caused me to lean forward/back. i didn\u2019t do or say anything until i asked if they wanted to switch. hope that clears up the confusion.", "Then they should book seats next to each other. People do this spaced booking on purpose because they hope for free space. If that doesn't work out, you shouldn't act like the seats are adjoining and the person between you doesn't exist.", "NTA, this would have been a great time to read a newspaper.  \nBut that might be my petty side coming out.", "I really like this part:\n\n> \u201cit\u2019s not that you\u2019re bothering me, but it\u2019s a little eh\u201d, *hand gesture*\n\nVery Larry David of you lol.", "Yes. It\u2019s weird af. That\u2019s what I mean by unhinged. Maybe I change it to weird? Just absolutely weird behavior.", "Yes. If they are rude enough to talk over you, after you have offered to switch seats, then you become part of the conversation.", "Weird. What's the problem with the middle seat if you're still seated next to a stranger? What's the difference if that stranger is on the left or the right?", "yes, i don't see how their race is relevant at all either. unsure why you mentioned it in fact.  \n\n\nbased on your last comment I am lead to believe you refrained from speaking up because you are racially prejudiced? in which case I will change my vote to YTA.", "I love how you assume I\u2019ve never been in your position for 4,5 hours. I just put in earphones and minded my business. It\u2019s amazing how nobody yelled at anyone that plain ride.", "i could agree but there was a little more verbiage that was had. \u201ci guess it\u2019s fine, we\u2019ll stop talking. i didn\u2019t know you couldn\u2019t talk on a plane\u201d felt to me like gaslighting but to each their own.", "if i\u2019m still the asshole in your opinion, then i\u2019ll accept it, but the only movement done before i asked was to let the woman on the outside know that i was the middle seat so that she could get up and let me in.", "literally, almost like i was invisible", "Well middle seats suck.   So they weren't wrong to do what they did.", "absolutely. so sorry that happened to you. that is insanity", "got it, \ud83d\ude02 malicious compliance. i think i misunderstood what you meant!", "there\u2019s a few reasons. lack of arm rest space, leg space, is usually the top. i normally sit next to strangers and didn\u2019t care, but this was a lot", "If you\u2019re flying coach class, you\u2019re often packed into the seats like sardines. \n\nMiddle seat = squished.", "yes. i refrained from speaking up and saying exactly what i needed because their race is normally prejudice against mine. i\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s the correct way to explain it, but would love to have a chat about how i could\u2019ve handled this situation better.", "you being fine with being a physical barrier to a conversation is your business. it is not ideal to sit in the middle of a conversation, and is quite uncomfortable, i didnt ask them to shut up; i asked if one wanted to switch seats so that they could talk to each other more easily than playing monkey in the middle but i digress. your opinion is your own and i can accept it.", "Isn't window seat equally squished? I would argue that aisle seat is worse because you have to contend with traffic. Different strokes for different folks I guess.", "simply put aside your biases and use your words. or speak to a flight attendant directly.", "Yeah, but you can look out the window and lean your head against the wall for a nap. But yeah, different strokes for different folks. Personally I only like the aisle but second choice I\u2019d take window.", "i can agree with that. sometimes it feels a little aggressive to get others involved but will take that into consideration for the next time. Thank you for your feedback.", "Personally, I don't care which seat I'm in. I just hate being on planes, ha ha.", "I hear that!!! I hate air travel!"]}
