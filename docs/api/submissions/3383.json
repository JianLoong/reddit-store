My mom (52 F) have always been strict on all of us, more so after our dad died 10 years ago. When he was pressumed brain dead, my mom pulled my sister (then 13, now 23) aside and told her that she needs to be a parent to her younger siblings since she (my mom) needs to work for us. For context, my mom have 4 children, me being the second oldest. When my sister went to college/uni, she rented an apartment which leaves me to deal with everything in the house. \n\nWhen the pandemic hit, things got pretty heavy. I tried to do everything she wants me to do because she pays for my things, and that's \"the least i can do\". So I work part time at her company, do things she asks me to, and recently, that was to take care of my younger siblings. \n\nEver since school started, I have to take care of their meals, their packed lunches, make sure that they do their assignments and projects, I even make lunch and dinner. I wake up at 4 AM to meal prep since their school starts at 6 AM. And yet, despite all of that, I get constantly barated with questions like \"when will I get a proper job?\", or \"did you apply for a job yet?\". \n\nRecently at dinner, I told her that someone pointed out to me that I'm doing her job, as a mother, and that made me sad. My sister went to her defense and sarcasticly asked me \"Why?\" in which I answered with a why not, but i did tell them that it made me sad because it felt like a slap to my face that we were one parent short, that's why I have to step up to do a mother's job. My sister went silent because she knew I was right. Even though mom told her to step up 10 years ago, she focused more on the money and earning and providing for our family, just like mom was. I was the caretaker of the family, and she was the moneymaker. \n\nAs soon as I said that, my mom said \"then starting from today, I'll do it.\" And it sounded sarcastic to me so I asked her to stop it, and that I was just sharing my feelings (which we normally do), but she replied with \"well, what do you want me to reply after hearing you say that? I just want you to grow and be your own person. I appreciate what you do but if you don't want to do it anymore then okay, from now on, I'll do it.\"\n\nHer words came off as passive aggressive to me because it felt as if she's guilt tripping me and that I should have just sucked it up. When she said she appreciate what I do, it made me remember all the times she told me that I was useless since all I do was laze around all day and that I never work, that I never helped her, and arrogant for talking back to her when she gives me everything I have ever wanted. \n\nI honestly don't know what to do anymore, instead of feeling relieved to have shared something to my mom, my chest felt heavier and I can't seem to sleep.\n\nSo, am I the asshole? Should I apologize to my mom?", "created_utc": 1669576100, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z69lg5/aita_for_telling_my_mom_that_ive_been_doing_her/", "score": 181, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You and your sister can both attest that you have been parenting these children.

It was a hard thing to say and a hard thing for your mom to hear. I suggest you watchfully accept your mom's offer.

That's not your fault, but it might explain her disposition. Good Luck!", "NTA Your mother committed parentification on you, which is child abuse, stealing your childhood from you. When you expressed your feelings you basically told her what she did, so she swiftly turned it all around back onto you. Making you into the bad guy and feeling bad for expressing sadness, not even complaint, for what she did. What she did was a very clever peace of manipulation on you so she can feel guilt free and get you to keep doing what you doing. By saying, 'okay if you don't want to do it anymore, I will do it.'
