Emi is my only child. She\u2019s been sick since she was 2, and if I\u2019m going to be honest, she likely won\u2019t make it to 10. Her dad left us when she got sick. \n\nEmi spends one week in the hospital then a week at home. Because of this, the last time I was able to send her to school was 2 years ago when we were able to do preschool 3 hours a day, 2 days a week, and they still wore masks. Now the only time she\u2019s around other kids is when she\u2019s in the hospital. \n\nEmi hates sharing her toys so I try not to make her do it. Usually when we see her cousins, I\u2019ll buy something like a big pack of chalk and a gallon of bubbles and I\u2019ll tell her it\u2019s for everybody but that\u2019s the only time she\u2019ll share. \n\nMy sister and her 2 daughters (5 and 7) are living with us temporarily. It\u2019s been difficult for everyone. At first I switched rooms with Emi and we put all 3 girls in the master but Emi hated sharing rooms and said the girls were always touching her stuff so we switched back and I put the girls in the spare room with their mom. My sister was complaining that the room was too crowded so she\u2019s staying on a cot in my office but apparently that\u2019s also uncomfortable so she wants the girls to share again. My sister does not pay any rent. Her husband sends $500 a month to help pay for their groceries and she helps with Emi while I\u2019m working (my job is pretty flexible so I\u2019m able to watch her while I work). They\u2019ve also been complaining that I take Emi on day/weekend trips without them. \n\nEmi just spent the week in the hospital and we came home on Saturday. My nieces beds were moved into Emi\u2019s room and her toys were everywhere. I confronted my sister and she said Emi isn\u2019t using her room or her toys half the time and that little girls should be sharing with each other. I told her that Emi has already made it clear that she does not want to share her room or her toys, and that her room needs to be the way we left it by the end of the day. \n\nShe says I\u2019m being unfair so I snapped at her that I will be prioritizing my kid over her ungrateful self and her kids and that if she can\u2019t get over my kid not sharing she needs to find somewhere else to live. \n\nThey did fix Emi\u2019s room but they haven\u2019t been talking to us. At this point I\u2019m thinking about kicking them out anyways.

The one thing Emi can do is make a safe place for herself, so things aren\u2019t as scary when she\u2019s at home. \n\nThat safe place, where things aren\u2019t as scary, is her room and her toys. By taking or being in her room and playing with her toys, you make her safe place scary. \n\nI also suggest a field trip to the hospital when Emi is there.", "INFO:\n\nDoes your sister work, and if not, why?", "NTA.

I\u2019ve been a pediatric nurse for 20 years and was also medically fragile growing up. I understand you want to protect your daughter, I get that. But even sick children need to understand and accept the concept of sharing. I don\u2019t agree with your sister taking over the house AT ALL!

So basically your sister and her kids are in crisis and dealing with recent trauma, and you're mixing that with your very ill daughter and your grief. \n\nI can't vote anyone AH here, because I think you're all reacting with big emotions to some very sad circumstances.

The fact that your daughter is chronically/terminally ill does not mean you should treat her like a toddler forever. NO KID WANTS TO SHARE.

You tried to help but she showed that she doesn\u2019t understand a key tenet of the house. Which is that it is about Emi. And it\u2019s not fair. It doesn\u2019t have to be. It\u2019s about you and Emi. If she understood that and collaborated with you on it, made sure her kids respected that, it would be one thing.

She is a first recorded combination situation.  Has had 11 \"threat to life episodes\" this year alone and one emergency throat surgery.  Has officially \"flatlined\" three times, once needing direct hand on heart cardic resus during a surgery that was trying to save her life and instead went very wrong.  Whilst we have been informed that there is no expectation of a short life, very few children with one of her diagnoses live past 25.  Most die from cardiac issues.  So I have some idea of being a parent to a chronically sick, immunocompromised, medically heavy and life altering child though our daily threat is another cat 1 rather than losing her for at least another two decades.  All that to say I do not know or have experience of what either family in this discussion is going through.\n\nI completely agree that things have gone too far with your SIL disrespecting you and your daughters house and family.  Some real, adult discussions need to be had to reinforce what is and is not acceptable.  However, you invited them into your home without due consideration to what this might actually look like.  Whilst things are not being helped by your SIL, you cannot expect a 5 and 7 year old not to touch all the toys in all the rooms, all the time.  They WILL try it on to see where you and your SIL draw the line.  They are 6 and 7 and to expect them to behave like an adult 100% of the time in your house, even with your SIL toeing the line, would never happen.  I think you need to find a communal space (just a corner, doesn't need to be a whole room) where all toys are safe for them to play with, probably by removing your daughters toys in that room or area to another place whilst you cohabit and allowing them a space to put their own toys there.  Your SIL definitely did something wrong, but you also did not consider the needs for a space to play and explore Vs a place to rest, be calm and sleep, in your house.\n\nSuggest the following:\n1) sit down with SIL and let her know that she was not in the right to let her kids in your child's room.  That is their safe space at all times.  It is more important than ever since her communal areas are currently shared.  This was a flat YTA on her part.  She has a lot of groveling and making up to do.\n2) discuss a heard deadline for moving out.  This isn't going to work long term.  Start that ball rolling.\n3) discuss with SIL where the kids and SIL will sleep and an area you will remove your daughter's toys so the children can play.  Best case, your daughter and her kids play with their own toys but in the same room.  All win.  I do not think it is right to ask your daughter to share, just that a space is made for your nieces to have a small space to play with their own toys safe of the temptation of your daughter's toys in their very immediate vicinity.\n4) let SIL know the terms of breaking these rules.  Something like out the house in X hours might be reasonable but you know your situation best.\n5) then have a sit down with all 5 of you and let them know this in language they understand.  Maybe write something up in child friendly language to stick on the front of the fridge \n6 and most important) part of the terms of staying is SIL and her daughter's do something to say sorry to your daughter about what they did in her room.  Eg all make sorry cards saying what they did wrong and why they won't do it again.  Means SIL had to accept wrongdoing and help her kids understand better boundaries.  It is all to easy to ask 5 and 7 year olds to explain what they did wrong and not actually realise and correct behaviour.  I have found this sort of exercise helps cement the understanding of the underlying issues.  Maybe these then need to go on the fridge too once your SIL and nieces have presented them to your daughter.", "The entitlement some people have is mind-boggling.

If they don\u2019t want to share it they must put it in their room put away. This worked very well. There were many times when Kid A\u2019s toy would be in the living room and Kid B would grab it and Kid A would sit and watch and wait for Kid B to put it down then Kid A would grab it and run to his room to put it away.

Why? What does teaching a child they have to share what belongs to them with others teach them in the long run? That others desires are more important than their own even when it comes to things that belong to them. \n\nCan you imagine shaming an adult who doesn't want to loan his car to a friend because that friend doesn't treat it with respect? Can you imagine shaming an adult who doesn't want to give up all their food so someone else can rifle through it and leave a mess? Can you imagine shaming an adult that won't allow his sibling to use his computer when the sibling constantly exposes the computer to viruses? \n\nBecause that's what teaching your child to share when she doesn't want to is teaching her. (Or any kid). It's teaching her that her boundaries don't matter. It's teaching her that others get to override her decisions. It's teaching her that she cannot make decisions about what belongs to her (and that often teaches kids, especially girls, that they cannot make decisions about their own bodies either). \n\nI'm so sorry your child is sick. I'm so sorry she has such a short life expectancy. You are most decidedly not the ahole here. Even if your child was expected to live to 100, you would still not be the asshole for respecting your child's boundaries. \n\nI have three kids, and there have been times where they have had to share rooms. But even then, there were things that belonged to them that they did not have to share. If one of their siblings had said item, they could politely ask for it back, and it was to be returned. Because it belonged to them. Just like I, as an adult, should be able to ask anyone not to take my stuff without permission, my children are able to do the same. Keeping something that does not belong to you without permission of the owner is theft. At any age. Forcing kids to share what belongs to them is teaching them to let others take advantage of them. \n\nI taught my kids that sharing is a very kind thing to do, but is not required. And honestly, sharing with a bad attitude is pointless. Communal property has to be shared, but in a way that's fair for everyone. For example, one of my kids watches horror films for comfort. His twin can't handle horror, but loves to play genshin impact. They both use the tv in the living room. That is something they have to share. Because it belongs to all of us. When they were younger, I put guidelines in place to ensure that the sharing was equitable. Now they are teens, and they have found ways to share that works well for both of them.

Emi is my only child. She\u2019s been sick since she was 2, and if I\u2019m going to be honest, she likely won\u2019t make it to 10. Her dad left us when she got sick. \n\nEmi spends one week in the hospital then a week at home. Because of this, the last time I was able to send her to school was 2 years ago when we were able to do preschool 3 hours a day, 2 days a week, and they still wore masks. Now the only time she\u2019s around other kids is when she\u2019s in the hospital. \n\nEmi hates sharing her toys so I try not to make her do it. Usually when we see her cousins, I\u2019ll buy something like a big pack of chalk and a gallon of bubbles and I\u2019ll tell her it\u2019s for everybody but that\u2019s the only time she\u2019ll share. \n\nMy sister and her 2 daughters (5 and 7) are living with us temporarily. It\u2019s been difficult for everyone. At first I switched rooms with Emi and we put all 3 girls in the master but Emi hated sharing rooms and said the girls were always touching her stuff so we switched back and I put the girls in the spare room with their mom. My sister was complaining that the room was too crowded so she\u2019s staying on a cot in my office but apparently that\u2019s also uncomfortable so she wants the girls to share again. My sister does not pay any rent. Her husband sends $500 a month to help pay for their groceries and she helps with Emi while I\u2019m working (my job is pretty flexible so I\u2019m able to watch her while I work). They\u2019ve also been complaining that I take Emi on day/weekend trips without them. \n\nEmi just spent the week in the hospital and we came home on Saturday. My nieces beds were moved into Emi\u2019s room and her toys were everywhere. I confronted my sister and she said Emi isn\u2019t using her room or her toys half the time and that little girls should be sharing with each other. I told her that Emi has already made it clear that she does not want to share her room or her toys, and that her room needs to be the way we left it by the end of the day. \n\nShe says I\u2019m being unfair so I snapped at her that I will be prioritizing my kid over her ungrateful self and her kids and that if she can\u2019t get over my kid not sharing she needs to find somewhere else to live. \n\nThey did fix Emi\u2019s room but they haven\u2019t been talking to us. At this point I\u2019m thinking about kicking them out anyways. AITA for telling her she needs to get over my kid not sharing or move out?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

You are offering what you can but your daughter shouldn't have to suffer because of it.", "NTA\n\nIt sounds like you might be at your breaking point.  Of course, you would prioritize your own daughter's needs first and make her home feel like her safe place.   \n\nYour sister is likely in a tough spot, which is why you agreed to take her in.

I know his parents regret it a lot (he spent most of his childhood in hospital)", "It seems unlikely that\u2019s the reason - OP said they started out with all the girls in one room, which wouldn\u2019t be the case if the issue was microbe exposure.", "They are both in school and she should be able to work, even part time while they\u2019re in school, she just doesn\u2019t want to.", "They are still together", "And this is a great opportunity for Emi to learn to share a bit. Even if she doesn't have much of a chance of getting there they should raise her so that if she ever becomes an adult she is a good one. \n\nI also wonder why OP gave up the master for the three kids to have room but isn't willing to give up the master so an adult and two kids can have room? If anything that would require more room than the 3 kids would have needed.  Like why is the guest room big enough for the sister and her kids but not big enough for all the kids?", "Can you define the difference between dying of a disease & a disease causing you to die in a certain amount of time? What do you think is happening between now & death? Dying. That's what's happening. Just like we all are to a much lesser & slower degree", "She made it clear she does not. Emi told everybody what she would like to happen and that is her cousins not using her stuff.", "Your comment is gross.  Kid won't live to be a teenager, her bratty cousins can accept the rules or get out.  Fuck off with that shit.", "Um, OP has already made clear she requires masking in order to keep Emi safe. How do you propose Emi get socialized when people refuse to acknowledge that Covid is a vascular disease and not just a cold? \n\nThis is a kid who is already likely terminal, and you want to just send her to school or in social situations where she can get Covid or flu?", "Sounds like the district is providing homebound services. Totally appropriate for situations like this.", "In most countries, schooling is a legal requirement, with attendance of some sort needed, and absence of the child punishable to the parents, by anything from a fine to jail time\u2026.", "As an adult, it is a choice.  I'm not compelled.", "Sometimes. But it is totally normal for an adult to say \u201cno I\u2019m sorry I don\u2019t want to loan that object \u201cit\u2019s not at all unusual. Whereas kids are expected to share their toys if they\u2019re not currently using it.", "Hey, it really sounds like you're projecting to be honest. \n\nWhat you're talking about is such a minor thing in the face of  accepting your own child not growing up to be a teen. I'm sorry but I have to say you just don't get that, much experience as you may have seeing children in your work. \n\nPlenty of badly behaved children grown up to be well adjusted adults because life knocks you about till you act straight. \n\nSuggesting that a mother who's dealing with pretty demanding medical care of a child who is by default lonely and has no peers, but now she MUST TRAIN HER SICK CHILD TO DEAL WITH TWO MORE KIDS WHO THINK NOTHING OF INVADING HER SPACE WHEN SHE'S AWAY, is waaay too much to demand of a parent who's going through the unimaginable. \n\nThis is a bridge they'll cross when they come to it", "What are you talking about there\u2019s a decent chance? You don\u2019t know that. You are just making things up now.", "That's honestly what I cannot get past. \"Oh, the terminally ill child is being selfish, you're a terrible parent for allowing it.\" What the absolute heckity fuck.", "Well, I voted ESH because I don't agree with sister attitude either. \n\nOP's daughter is selfish, it's a fact. While you all gave reasons why she is like that and so am I that are all true (she is sick, she doesnt have control over her body and wants to have over her toys, her mother didn't teach how to share), does not change that by not sharing none of her toys with her cousins, she is, by definition, selfish.\n\nI dont think it's the girl's fault but her mother. And I also think that is a shame that OP and her sister are fighting ober something so stupid. \n\nI really think OP's child and her nieces would benefit playing together. She is sick, she is in and out hospital. That is sad and also lonely. Just because she will die soon doesn't mean she can't have a glipse of friendship is, even the \"friends\" are her own cousins", "For just a moment, I thought you were my friend's mother. The diagnosis, the survival time, the surgery time all line up with my friend's timeline. Unfortunately, I don't think my friend's last MRI came back clear.\n\nI'm so grateful that you've been given more time with your son, just as we're grateful to have been given more time with our friend. Cherish every single moment of it.", "I\u2019m so sorry for your son\u2019s dx. Wishing you so much more quality time with him. God bless.", "Huge hugs.", "You were the reminder I needed today. My mom drives me a little crazy. She was diagnosed with a very aggressive cancer in Dec 2019. Average survival is 2 years, we are heading toward year 4. I am really grateful she is doing so well. It\u2019s easy to forget since she beat all the odds that it can change so suddenly. You reminded me to be grateful so thank you.   \n\nOP you are amazing. I will be praying for both of you & that your daughter also beats the odds. NTA", "I agree.", "THIS\\^\\^\n\nMy youngest has some health issues and the lack of control over their life really does a number on them. It burbles out in various aspects of their life which aren't always obviously related to their health issues.\n\nKids dealing with illnesses require way different parenting than kids who do not.", "It was my husbands SIL, and her first time leaving the state she grew up in. I almost kicked them out the first day because of it. She then told our shared MIL that I didn\u2019t have any cooking utensils, so that\u2019s what I got for Christmas. Then MIL saw my kitchen later and apologized.", "If that's true, I'd be kicking him out and letting him serve time in a proper prison. OPs BIL I'd the AH for prioritizing his monster of a son over literally anyone else.", "Still in no position to demand that a little girl (who may not have another 4 years) be made uncomfortable or unhappy, especially if she's in and out of the hospital. It sucks, but OP is helping the sister out while still trying to give her daughter some normalcy.", "Good chance that they had to leave quite a few of their own toys at home...", "There\u2019s a difference between \u201cyour favorite bedtime stuffy\u201d and \u201cevery single toy you own\u201d. It is unreasonable to expect any child to give up their favorite bedtime stuffy, and I doubt Emi has to do so. It is also unreasonable to say Emi doesn\u2019t have to share any of her toys ever, unless these girls also don\u2019t have to share any of their toys with Emi. But I have a feeling that rule is only one way.", "Yeah, obviously only OP could tell us, but\u2026 this is why I added that bit about uprooting them. Could you imagine undergoing that kind of trauma, then being removed from a stable housing situation because your mother was being a jerk to your aunt and her dying child? The idea is awful, and I fully support OP putting her foot down and putting her daughter first but I think in order to be in the best position morally here she\u2019d at least try to give her sister some time to find another stable accommodation. It all sounds really messy though and I feel bad for everyone involved, even the aunt because it sounds like her home situation is a whole issue within itself.", "sounds like what someone I knew went through.. they found out one of the kids (as a kid) was touching the other ones inappropriately.. they have a legit mental disorder where they don't understand empathy and have to be with therapists and cannot be left around any of the female members.", "Depends on the country but in most places any property you bring into a marriage is owned 50/50 once you're married.", "The kick her the fuck out. She's a leech and she's taking things for granted. You need to prioritise your daughter", "You need to kick her out and let her sort out her own problems. She is taking advantage of your kindness and disrespecting your home.", "There\u2019s no guarantee that she won\u2019t live to be a teen but there\u2019s also no guarantee she would. My great uncle was super sick for his whole life, constantly in and out of the hospital, surgeries, got 3-4 different types of cancer throughout his life, doctors said he wouldn\u2019t live past the age of 2 but he lived all the way into his 70s. I hope for OPs kid that they do live a very long, fulfilling life.", "Guess her kid doesn't ever wanna have friends then?", "Would you have learned how to if you were never taught how as a child? Children are taught how to share so that as adults they can choose to.", "But to not share at all? Maybe it's just the mom friend in me, but I don't think about the sharing I do, I just pass someone an extra. I'd like to think most adults are the same. As a woman, even though I use a menstrual cup, I have emergency tampons in case Gondor calls for aid in a bathroom. Rohan will ALWAYS answer. I've known trans women who had tampons on them for that exact scenario. \n\nDo you really think about it when you get a coffee for a friend so the cashier doesn't need to ring up an extra transaction, or do you just say \"don't worry, I've got this one\"? Sharing is a cornerstone of society. If one person is always shared with but never shares, it'll build resentment.", "I have had experience with life knocking it into me, and it fucking sucks. It's better, coming from personal experience, to learn these lessons young. \n\nAnd, on a truly dark, horrible note that I hope doesn't come to pass- if, God forbid, her daughter does die, how does she want her to be remembered? The sweet kid who died too soon or the mean cousin?", "Recently there was a transplant done in which the recipient will not need to take immunosuppressive medication. Medicine is progressing rapidly- you never know when a death sentence will become a chronic condition.", "I wouldn't think the child was being selfish even if she weren't terminally ill. Children have a right to their own belongings just the same as an adult. The very fact that OP's sister thinks she can *steamroll a child* into giving up their own room and toys tells me this isn't as much about sharing as it is the sister expecting OP to make her kids happy.", "Both moms just want their traumatized children to be happy, and they have competing needs. It's just rough for all involved.", "Not in most places in the US. You have to use a quitclaim deed or an interspousal transfer deed.", "She's *dying*. She probably can't even be around unrelated kids because of the danger of germs.", "I think the thing is: would you share your menstrual cup? No, because it\u2019s too personal. \nKids should get a say in what is and what isn\u2019t to be shared\u2026", "Buying someone a coffee is not sharing your stuff.\n\nYou seem to be operating under the assumption that this little girl should act the way other little girls should. Why is that true? Her entire life is not like other kids. She has very little in her life. There is absolutely nothing wrong with maintaining the consistency of ownership of her own things. \n\nBeing forced to share isn\u2019t sharing. It\u2019s theft.", "It really doesn't matter how she's REMEMBERED, the only thing that matters is how she LIVES RIGHT NOW.\n\n\nThat's the part you don't get. \n\n\nAnd life knocking it into you? Yes that's life. Fellow all kinds of abuse survivor here. No one gives a shit. You just make your own way. But as a mom, the last thing I'll tell another mom who's processing the possible death of her child is to not prioritise that child's happiness in the here and now. \n\nWe'll just have to disagree friend.", "I completely agree. I have children, and each of them have toys they don't want to share. And I'm perfectly OK with them being firm in not wanting to share them. \n\nI truthfully don't get the mentality of \"Children must share everything they own to 'play nicely'.\" Um, no, thanks. I don't have to share my stuff, why do my kids?", "Well said", "Buying a coffee is sharing your money. There's a general expectation in that situation that the recipient cover you in the future. When my friend left her wallet in the car, I didn't make her walk back to buy her own latte, I just got it. When my basil plant died, she dropped off a cutting of hers. When my bank put in my travel notice incorrectly on a trip, the friend I was visiting covered my meals until I got it sorted, and then I covered other meals. We didn't keep running tallies of exact amounts owed, we were just nice to each other.", "I just know that there was a time I was coddled as there was a big chance I wouldn't make it to 18 between a BMI that belonged in Auschwitz and trying to off myself. My parents seriously discussed my death- I saw their browser history. I can appreciate what they were trying to do while also recognizing that they didn't do me any favors in the long run.", "I'm sorry to hear that, and I hope you've built a safe and stable life for yourself. \n\nThis situation isn't the same though. And there's no antidote to life knocking some hard lessons into you. \n\nOP and Emi would much rather have the hard knocks of life than not having life at all. \n\nWhat OP's sister and her kids are doing is a gross invasion of Emi's safe space. I don't expect my houseguests to rummage through my wardrobe because I'm away. Sick child or not, I wouldn't give in to entitled bullies.", "Oh, the kids are going too far. I'm all for a lock on the door, but I think toys left in the main living area that aren't being played with are fair game, which OP has stated they disagree with. Not every toy has to be shared, but the level of coddling described will lead to some knocks on the level of getting hit by several freight trains, followed by a 747", "I see what you mean. But that's probably a good problem to have from OP's current pov."]}
