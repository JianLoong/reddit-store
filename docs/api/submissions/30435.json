Emi is my only child. She\u2019s been sick since she was 2, and if I\u2019m going to be honest, she likely won\u2019t make it to 10. Her dad left us when she got sick. \n\nEmi spends one week in the hospital then a week at home. Because of this, the last time I was able to send her to school was 2 years ago when we were able to do preschool 3 hours a day, 2 days a week, and they still wore masks. Now the only time she\u2019s around other kids is when she\u2019s in the hospital. \n\nEmi hates sharing her toys so I try not to make her do it. Usually when we see her cousins, I\u2019ll buy something like a big pack of chalk and a gallon of bubbles and I\u2019ll tell her it\u2019s for everybody but that\u2019s the only time she\u2019ll share. \n\nMy sister and her 2 daughters (5 and 7) are living with us temporarily. It\u2019s been difficult for everyone. At first I switched rooms with Emi and we put all 3 girls in the master but Emi hated sharing rooms and said the girls were always touching her stuff so we switched back and I put the girls in the spare room with their mom. My sister was complaining that the room was too crowded so she\u2019s staying on a cot in my office but apparently that\u2019s also uncomfortable so she wants the girls to share again. My sister does not pay any rent. Her husband sends $500 a month to help pay for their groceries and she helps with Emi while I\u2019m working (my job is pretty flexible so I\u2019m able to watch her while I work). They\u2019ve also been complaining that I take Emi on day/weekend trips without them. \n\nEmi just spent the week in the hospital and we came home on Saturday. My nieces beds were moved into Emi\u2019s room and her toys were everywhere. I confronted my sister and she said Emi isn\u2019t using her room or her toys half the time and that little girls should be sharing with each other. I told her that Emi has already made it clear that she does not want to share her room or her toys, and that her room needs to be the way we left it by the end of the day. \n\nShe says I\u2019m being unfair so I snapped at her that I will be prioritizing my kid over her ungrateful self and her kids and that if she can\u2019t get over my kid not sharing she needs to find somewhere else to live. \n\nThey did fix Emi\u2019s room but they haven\u2019t been talking to us. At this point I\u2019m thinking about kicking them out anyways.

The one thing Emi can do is make a safe place for herself, so things aren\u2019t as scary when she\u2019s at home. \n\nThat safe place, where things aren\u2019t as scary, is her room and her toys.

She is a first recorded combination situation.  Has had 11 \"threat to life episodes\" this year alone and one emergency throat surgery.  Has officially \"flatlined\" three times, once needing direct hand on heart cardic resus during a surgery that was trying to save her life and instead went very wrong.  Whilst we have been informed that there is no expectation of a short life, very few children with one of her diagnoses live past 25.  Most die from cardiac issues.  So I have some idea of being a parent to a chronically sick, immunocompromised, medically heavy and life altering child though our daily threat is another cat 1 rather than losing her for at least another two decades.  All that to say I do not know or have experience of what either family in this discussion is going through.\n\nI completely agree that things have gone too far with your SIL disrespecting you and your daughters house and family.  Some real, adult discussions need to be had to reinforce what is and is not acceptable.  However, you invited them into your home without due consideration to what this might actually look like.  Whilst things are not being helped by your SIL, you cannot expect a 5 and 7 year old not to touch all the toys in all the rooms, all the time.  They WILL try it on to see where you and your SIL draw the line.  They are 6 and 7 and to expect them to behave like an adult 100% of the time in your house, even with your SIL toeing the line, would never happen.  I think you need to find a communal space (just a corner, doesn't need to be a whole room) where all toys are safe for them to play with, probably by removing your daughters toys in that room or area to another place whilst you cohabit and allowing them a space to put their own toys there.  Your SIL definitely did something wrong, but you also did not consider the needs for a space to play and explore Vs a place to rest, be calm and sleep, in your house.\n\nSuggest the following:\n1) sit down with SIL and let her know that she was not in the right to let her kids in your child's room.  That is their safe space at all times.  It is more important than ever since her communal areas are currently shared.  This was a flat YTA on her part.  She has a lot of groveling and making up to do.\n2) discuss a heard deadline for moving out.  This isn't going to work long term.  Start that ball rolling.\n3) discuss with SIL where the kids and SIL will sleep and an area you will remove your daughter's toys so the children can play.  Best case, your daughter and her kids play with their own toys but in the same room.  All win.  I do not think it is right to ask your daughter to share, just that a space is made for your nieces to have a small space to play with their own toys safe of the temptation of your daughter's toys in their very immediate vicinity.\n4) let SIL know the terms of breaking these rules.  Something like out the house in X hours might be reasonable but you know your situation best.\n5) then have a sit down with all 5 of you and let them know this in language they understand.  Maybe write something up in child friendly language to stick on the front of the fridge \n\n6 and most important) part of the terms of staying is SIL and her daughter's do something to say sorry to your daughter about what they did in her room.  Eg all make sorry cards saying what they did wrong and why they won't do it again.  Means SIL had to accept wrongdoing and help her kids understand better boundaries.  It is all to easy to ask 5 and 7 year olds to explain what they did wrong and not actually realise and correct behaviour.  I have found this sort of exercise helps cement the understanding of the underlying issues.  Maybe these then need to go on the fridge too once your SIL and nieces have presented them to your daughter.\n\nEdit: formatting", "The entitlement some people have is mind-boggling.

If they don\u2019t want to share it they must put it in their room put away. This worked very well. There were many times when Kid A\u2019s toy would be in the living room and Kid B would grab it and Kid A would sit and watch and wait for Kid B to put it down then Kid A would grab it and run to his room to put it away.

Why? What does teaching a child they have to share what belongs to them with others teach them in the long run? That others desires are more important than their own even when it comes to things that belong to them. \n\nCan you imagine shaming an adult who doesn't want to loan his car to a friend because that friend doesn't treat it with respect? Can you imagine shaming an adult who doesn't want to give up all their food so someone else can rifle through it and leave a mess? Can you imagine shaming an adult that won't allow his sibling to use his computer when the sibling constantly exposes the computer to viruses? \n\nBecause that's what teaching your child to share when she doesn't want to is teaching her. (Or any kid). It's teaching her that her boundaries don't matter. It's teaching her that others get to override her decisions. It's teaching her that she cannot make decisions about what belongs to her (and that often teaches kids, especially girls, that they cannot make decisions about their own bodies either). \n\nI'm so sorry your child is sick. I'm so sorry she has such a short life expectancy. You are most decidedly not the ahole here. Even if your child was expected to live to 100, you would still not be the asshole for respecting your child's boundaries. \n\nI have three kids, and there have been times where they have had to share rooms. But even then, there were things that belonged to them that they did not have to share. If one of their siblings had said item, they could politely ask for it back, and it was to be returned. Because it belonged to them. Just like I, as an adult, should be able to ask anyone not to take my stuff without permission, my children are able to do the same. Keeping something that does not belong to you without permission of the owner is theft. At any age. Forcing kids to share what belongs to them is teaching them to let others take advantage of them. \n\nI taught my kids that sharing is a very kind thing to do, but is not required. And honestly, sharing with a bad attitude is pointless. Communal property has to be shared, but in a way that's fair for everyone. For example, one of my kids watches horror films for comfort. His twin can't handle horror, but loves to play genshin impact. They both use the tv in the living room. That is something they have to share. Because it belongs to all of us. When they were younger, I put guidelines in place to ensure that the sharing was equitable. Now they are teens, and they have found ways to share that works well for both of them.

Emi is my only child. She\u2019s been sick since she was 2, and if I\u2019m going to be honest, she likely won\u2019t make it to 10. Her dad left us when she got sick. \n\nEmi spends one week in the hospital then a week at home. Because of this, the last time I was able to send her to school was 2 years ago when we were able to do preschool 3 hours a day, 2 days a week, and they still wore masks. Now the only time she\u2019s around other kids is when she\u2019s in the hospital. \n\nEmi hates sharing her toys so I try not to make her do it. Usually when we see her cousins, I\u2019ll buy something like a big pack of chalk and a gallon of bubbles and I\u2019ll tell her it\u2019s for everybody but that\u2019s the only time she\u2019ll share. \n\nMy sister and her 2 daughters (5 and 7) are living with us temporarily. It\u2019s been difficult for everyone. At first I switched rooms with Emi and we put all 3 girls in the master but Emi hated sharing rooms and said the girls were always touching her stuff so we switched back and I put the girls in the spare room with their mom. My sister was complaining that the room was too crowded so she\u2019s staying on a cot in my office but apparently that\u2019s also uncomfortable so she wants the girls to share again. My sister does not pay any rent. Her husband sends $500 a month to help pay for their groceries and she helps with Emi while I\u2019m working (my job is pretty flexible so I\u2019m able to watch her while I work). They\u2019ve also been complaining that I take Emi on day/weekend trips without them. \n\nEmi just spent the week in the hospital and we came home on Saturday. My nieces beds were moved into Emi\u2019s room and her toys were everywhere. I confronted my sister and she said Emi isn\u2019t using her room or her toys half the time and that little girls should be sharing with each other. I told her that Emi has already made it clear that she does not want to share her room or her toys, and that her room needs to be the way we left it by the end of the day. \n\nShe says I\u2019m being unfair so I snapped at her that I will be prioritizing my kid over her ungrateful self and her kids and that if she can\u2019t get over my kid not sharing she needs to find somewhere else to live. \n\nThey did fix Emi\u2019s room but they haven\u2019t been talking to us. At this point I\u2019m thinking about kicking them out anyways. AITA for telling her she needs to get over my kid not sharing or move out?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

You are offering what you can but your daughter shouldn't have to suffer because of it.", "NTA\n\nIt sounds like you might be at your breaking point.  Of course, you would prioritize your own daughter's needs first and make her home feel like her safe place.   \n\nYour sister is likely in a tough spot, which is why you agreed to take her in.
