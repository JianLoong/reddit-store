I was with our son for the entire week and stayed up with him throughout the night etc. \n\nI will admit I was pretty annoyed when we come home from the hospital today to find the house an absolute mess. I was annoyed but brushed it off as I  know he was keen to come back to the hospital as he couldn't stay with us. \n\nlate afternoon, I told him I need to take  a nap. He said okay 20 minutes, he come in woke me up and said he neededsomething from his grandparents house for the car, and he gave me our baby. Bubs fell asleep but we need someone to watch him sleeping ATM so I can't sleep. he was gone for an 1 and a half hours. Bubs woke up about 45 minutes out screaming. i  called up hubby fairly annoyed  and asked for him to hurry up cause I needed help. \n\ntonight I was probably on the toilet for 5 minutes  when, our son woke up hungry. He called out to me asking how much longer I'll be. I answer not that much longer. He asked me to make bubs a bottle when I got off. \n\nA few minutes when by and I hear him sign and yell out \"I'm sorry buddy, mummy said she wasn't going to be long\", as he than made our son a bottle. \n\nI'm not going to lie, I'm tired and I lost it. \"WtF did you just say are you Fucking kidding me\". \n\n bubs was still crying so I grab baby off hubby and feed him his bottle. I was annoyed and signed quite loudly as I sat on the couch. He looked at me  \"wtf are you losing it for, you don't need to take him I'm handling it\". He went on a long spill about how I kept losing it at him, and that I needed to leave if I was so unhappy. \n\nI got up with baby and just shut the door until he fell asleep. I got up to put baby in his bassinet and hubby had turned off the light/TV etc and was heading to bed. \n\n I was pissed off.  He promised me he would do the night shift tonight so that I could get some sleep. I went into the room with baby about to get into bed, he asked if I was going to bring the bassinet in. I said no his going to sleep on me (we occasionally co - sleep). He asked why I was snapping at him. \n\n I said that I'm sick of it, and that he was being selfish for not staying up with him and that I can't even sleep on the couch cause he refused to clean it off. He started snapping back at me and I just got up and left to go into the lounge room. \n\nHubby tried yelling out to me to try and get me to come back into the bedroom but I just ignored him. He's now asleep in the room and I'm on the couch watching our son again. \n\nNow that his asleep and I'm on the couch I can't help but overthink is he right am I being the AH here and overreacting because I'm tired.", "created_utc": 1668610204, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ywvh41/aita_for_losing_it_at_my_husband/", "score": 34, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He's not holding up his end of the responsibility. Its completely justified that you would eventually lash out; he's making things overall harder for you and the child. He should be making things easier overall, and taking the load off of you.\n\nKids/Babies are a lot of work.", "NTA You are overthinking calling him out because you are tired. House was a mess. He gives you a 20 minute nap? Whoppee. I mean, it has to be stressful having a sick child, especially at 10 weeks, but what is your husband actually doing to help?", "NTA.. Your husband yelling to you about warming up a bottle, then yelling out loud about you taking too long, while you're in the bathroom, sums it all up. He could've held the baby while warming up a bottle. The rest is just further proof he lacks responsibility in sharing the bourden.\n\nThis just reminds me of Bill Burr's theory about laziasses who let the dishes pile up. And when their partner starts doing the dishes the laziass screams from the couch, \"Oh, I was going to do those.\" No you weren't.", "NTA. He's not stepping up.

It won't help and probably will make things worse but you are within your Right.\n\nI think you should get someone else to help with the baby if you can. It is very likely he will be uncomfortable being unhelpful in front of other People.\n\nNow, all in all, this is a lesson on how we shouldn't have kids unless we are sure our SO is compromised to help. I mean, he telling you that if you are not happy you should leave says it all", "NTA. I would lose it too.", "I wanna say NAH, because much as you have both clearly done some things wrong, this is a hellish situation and, no offence, but there's a real risk you're overstating his lack of help because of stress and fatigue.\n\nYes, you're wrong to snap at him. Talking to him about what you need help with is always going to be way more productive than being snippy after he 'fails'. But brain is not going to be braining good right now, so he should be willing to give you a pass on it.\n\nYes, he was wrong to ask you to take over when he was due to help, or for not doing things proactively, but he's been secondary in all this - you stay at the hospital and he gets to come visit, you decide schedules and he has to fit in around it - despite being just as invested (presumably). So giving him a little room to feel frustrated and not 'getting it' as easily would be reasonable.\n\nYou both need to sit down calmly and make arrangements for when you can each cover for the other, not just for sleep/work but for other stuff like housework and nipping to the shops and just taking a breather. Without the ability to rest when baby sleeps, this is likely to be unreasonable on both of you, but for short term, you need to find a balance you both can live with. You need to agree to be honest and up front: if you're in the loo and he asks if you can come for a feed, don't say you won't be long, tell him you're indisposed and ask if he can handle it; if you say you need to go nap, and he wants to go get something for the car, he needs to say up front that he has to go at X time, or agree to go now and be back in Y time, so you can delay or rearrange the nap if it's unavoidably conflicting. Saying yes and then failing to follow through seems to be a pattern for you both, so learn to say \"no but\" instead.", "NTA he had 9 months to prepare for this.

He's being a pretty shitty partner right now.", "NTA. But I\u2019m not going to insult your husband either, because we can only know so much from one reddit post. You guys are first time parents and you just brought him home not long ago. It was inevitable that you would reach a breaking point, and he needs to realize that as a dad, he has to step up and dealing with babies doesn\u2019t entirely fall on mom.

I had a mental crisis and was not a good support for my wife in the first few weeks we got home... I imagine its the same situation for you.. You're NTA you deserve your ass kissed rn.. I wish i could go back in time but i can only make it up now... IN his defense though he's a man and none of this comes as naturally for us..

You probably are both overreacting because you're tired. You've said he was at the hospital as well just not overnight because he wasn't allowed to stay. So he's traveling back and forth twice a day to the hospital then staying there as well. Guessing he's in survival mode like you are and got home and crashed or did essentials. That's why I'm going with YTA even if a soft one because he is as well and seems you're snapping at him acting like he shouldn't be strung out and exhausted, too.   \n\n\nWhy didn't he make the bottle initially because he was holding baby? How much longer than a few minutes did it take you?   \n\n\nBoth yall take a breath", "NTA\nBeing a parent is hard. It's even harder when one parent isn't fulfilling their part of the deal. Whatever he has going on, it is not more important than you and your baby. \n\nHe needs to clean up after himself, and he needs to let you sleep. He needs to do this everyday. Parents don't get holidays. \n\nHonestly I'd be pissed if my partner was acting this way, even for one day. My ex partner was this selfish and unhelpful. Hence the ex. \n\nYour husband needs to step up and make it up to you because this resentment will build up and ruin your relationship.", "NTA. My husband and I had to agree that things said at 2am with a crying baby shouldn\u2019t be held against us too much (it\u2019s not a free for all, but a little grace can be extended). With the week you\u2019ve had, the 2am rule should extend to whatever time of day that comes before you getting at least 6 uninterrupted hours of sleep. I get the sense that you are both dug in to your \u2018I had it harder\u201d positions, where you had it hard by living at the hospital for a week and he had it hard psychologically by not being able to be with you both as much as he wanted to be. Both are tough in different ways, but after some zzz\u2019s have a conversation about how to get back together as a team. That means that if you\u2019re on the can, he handles whatever baby needs. It means that you ignore a few messes for a few days because they\u2019re not a priority. It means that if one of you is watching the baby, the other is doing something essential to get you both back to baseline normal- like cleaning or food shopping, sleeping counts but NOT video games or socializing. Its not forever, just until you settle back into your routine and baby starts to feel better. I remember thinking that no one ever really tells you how much it absolutely SUCKS when our kids get sick. Intellectually you know, but you don\u2019t *know*  until you\u2019re in the thick of it. Everything grinds to a halt and the stress is unshakeable- that\u2019s normal, and it will get better I promise.", "Ooof already talking to the baby about you like that. Tell his ass to clean up his mess before walking you up. And LEARN how to make a bottle ffs.NTA", "NTA. Your husband is though. I\u2018m tired of men who reject their responsibilities as a parent and treat their partners (who literally BIRTHED the baby) awfully.", "He \"let\" you take a 20 minute nap when he's literally doing nothing? Drag him to counseling. If you're going to do all the work like you're single, you may as well actually single. Maybe a counselor can help him understand that.", "NTA. You both just got done with a SUPER scary thing. Having a ten week old in the hospital must have been terrifying. \n\nYour husband IS being inconsiderate right now. I personally would give a slight pass on the messy house because I know when I\u2019m worried, I shut down and cleaning is the last thing on my mind. But him giving you only a twenty minute nap before leaving you for over an hour with the baby is not ok.\n\nYou\u2019ve been through a TOUGH time. You were basically camped at a hospital! I\u2019m sure your husband was sick with worry, too, but you were on the front lines. You need rest. Is it possible to leave your baby with your husband for the day while you completely catch up on sleep? No interruptions, no baby care. After that, take another look at this. It seems that you feel that you did all the hard during this time while he did nothing. Talk about it. Ask him about his thought processes. Listen. Then see what you guys can do together to get stuff back in order after this ordeal. And what you guys want to prioritize right now. Good luck. \n\nI do want to say though: *please* only co-sleep if your baby has a bedside crib. Not on top of you or in your arms. Please please please. It may have been ok until now, but rollover deaths happen more than people think. It only takes once. My cousin in laws lost a child that way. They were exhausted, fell asleep on the bed with the baby, and woke up on top of the baby. The baby didn\u2019t wake up. Devastated the family.  I don\u2019t want to terrify you more after what you\u2019ve gone through, but PLEASE be safe with your little one.", "That makes sense.  It is not really about defending your husband, but about defending your choice", "Thank you. I do feel the need to explain, I'm not doing it alone we're both just stressed out with a sick baby and the hospital only allows for one parents at night. So the last week I've just been smash with constant baby watch without much of a nap, and I don't think he fully understand that. Hence why he didn't understand why I was snapping at him over what he perceived as little things.", "He doesn't mean leave him, he meant it more so like take a walk to calm down.  I've been with hubby for 6 years and he usually is quite helpful, I think it's more so just miscommunication.", "Thank you I do realise that now with the comments.   I might not have been clear about his laziness. He truly is a great dad and is usually on it and we work well together. But I think we're both just stressed out and tired from having a sick baby", "I don't regret having a baby with him at all.", "It wasn't an option, the hospital wouldn't let him it was only one parent. He could visit but because of the wards we were in we couldn't switch out or swap places.", "Thank you. I do feel I was being a bit harsh, and not giving him a chance before losing it. We're usually a far bit better, just tired and stressed out.", "Thank you.

He is usually quite patient and understanding. We hardly ever fight and are usually fantastic communicators.

He probably judges himself against that picture, and sees negative comments as an attack. I would simply tell him \"I have gone through 9 months of growing a baby, and I'm going to have months more of recovery, baby feeding and stress so I am putting in a lot of extra effort that maybe you don't see. You need to raise your effort to match, and that means supporting me with cleaning, feeding, letting me get sleep and some time alone when I need it. Up to now, you haven't done that and things like singing at the baby that I'm lazy is extremely hurtful. \"\n\nNTA but have the conversation. He needs to understand and start picking up the slack.\n\nPersonally, I think you've been amazingly restrained with the singing bit.", "That is quite contradictory on your initial post.

He sounds really bad based on your story. Now you\u2019re saying the opposite.", "She never implied that, but you jumped to that conclusion and it says alot about how you feel right now. It's important to reflect on why you feel like that.", "?", "Well I'm not quite sure what to say. Sometimes people do horrible things but doesn't make them horrible people. Just because I felt like he was being lazy and wasn't helping me at the time doesn't mean overall he doesn't help or is a lazy parent.", "Thank you I thought I was going crazy", "Definitely is isn't it (fucking autocorrect)", "Your son is ten weeks old, so if he\u2019s been lazy during those 10 weeks that would make him a lazy parent. \n\nDoesn\u2019t mean he can\u2019t turn it around though.", "You should probably have included that. NTA and try and get some sleep.", "It might be lack of sleep, or it's the way things are going right now. I would try to reflect on why you feel like this, write it down. Bullet point it, then speak to your partner. \n\nThe reason it's important to write it down, then turn it into bullet points and then reflect is because the first time it will be full of emotion and anger. The second time you'll be able put things in order and figure out what the actual issues are and the third reflection is to make sure the conversation won't be an attack on him. But about how you feel and how his actions made you feel, and what you can do to help eachother.\n\nRemember neither one of you are mind readers, you can't be angry at eachother for things you haven't discussed. So discuss everything you need now, then see if you're both making the effort to listen and try for eachother. \n\nAnd even though it's tempting to get angry and take the baby like you did. Don't do that, you need rest and by doing that you're not helping yourself feel better either. I understand you want to when you're angry but all you're doing is making yourself feel worse.\n\nRemember you're partners and it should be you two against the problem. Not you against the problem and your partner. \n\nHaving a baby is hard, your baby was in hospital and it was hard on both of you. Admittedly it was harder on you because you gave birth, but he's struggling as well. So when you talk about it, one of the points you both need to agree on is to be kinder to each other, to try better to be there for eachother and to talk because you're not mind readers and it's not fair to expect the other person to understand what's going on when you're both sleep deprived.", "At least you got a bundle of joy.. makes it easier to get over it ime lol", "I never said he has been lazy the last 10 weeks. This is just one incident where I felt he was an arsewhole I snap. He felt I was being an arsewhole and snap.", "They is only so much, they give you to write. I'm sorry if I was unclear but I was asking about this specific incident was ITA for snapping instead of communicating", "Thank you. We'll definitely have a talk"]}
