The people in our house were my mom, my stepdad, me (17f), and my stepbrother Mark (17m). Our guests were my stepsister Carrie (28f), her fianc\u00e9, her two stepdaughters (6 and 4) and her son Tim (5) as well as my brother Ryan (21m). \n\nThe guests were welcomed to bring additional food but there were plenty of good things to eat. There were apple pie and ice cream for dessert as well as my mom\u2019s special chocolate cake that everyone loves. She made two of the chocolate cake but accidentally dropped one, leaving only one for the party. \n\nMy brother Ryan goes to college in another city and would drive to join us (1.5 - 2 hour drive). About an hour before we were supposed to meet, Ryan called to let me know his car broke down and he was having a mechanic take a look at it. He said he would be a bit late but he should be able to make it and to save some food for him.\n\nI told everyone of Ryan\u2019s situation. Carrie and her family arrived on time and we had a delicious lunch. I helped slice and serve the chocolate cake - the piece was a bit small but everybody got one. I put Ryan\u2019s share on a plate and covered it to give to him later.\n\nWe chatted as we ate so it was a rather long meal but Ryan still didn\u2019t show up. My mom called him as we were about to have dessert and Ryan said he hoped he could be at home in time for dinner. Everyone accepted that and we dug into the sweets. My mom\u2019s chocolate cake was the first thing that vanished, of course, and we were eating the pie and ice cream when Tim said he wanted more cake.\n\nNow Mark offered to share his 2/3 eaten piece but Tim insisted that there was one more piece and he wanted that one. I told him that it was for Ryan who would join us later. Tim just started shouting that he wanted cake, finally crying. Carrie then asked me if Tim could have the cake, but I insisted it was for Ryan who last enjoyed it during his last visit at Christmas. Carrie comes over at least once a month so there would be plenty of opportunities for Tim to have the cake.\n\nTim cried until he fell asleep and Mark and Carrie\u2019s fianc\u00e9 offered to take care of the children\u2019s nap time while the rest of us clean up. Carrie sulked a little because I refused to give Tim the cake. Then Ryan called me that he couldn\u2019t come anymore because his car problems were more serious than he thought and he would visit us when the car was running again.\n\nAt this point, Carrie was upset that I had saved the cake for a person who didn\u2019t even show up instead of giving it to her son. I told her I could pack it for her to take home or give to Tim after he woke up. She said it would be much better if I offered this before Tim had to cry. I personally thought she spoiled her son a bit much but he was 5 and maybe I could offer him half a piece of the cake I saved for Ryan or something.

If I had a slice spare and three young kids I would've asked all of them if they wanted some before giving the last slice to one of them. That could otherwise cause a lot of drama.\n\nYou did the right thing.

Carrie has a pretty bad approach to parenting if, in the midst of a fit where her kid wants an extra serving at the detriment of someone else having a single serving, she'd rather give in and have others accommodate. You were COMPLETELY reasonable, and the fact that Ryan ultimately could not make it has ZERO bearing on how you should have responded to begin with. I have serious doubts about her judgment that she used that after the fact to suggest you were in the wrong. Yeesh I would have been tempted to throw it in the trash to spite them.", "NTA    a 5yr old doesn't need 2 pieces of cake, and he was offered to share Mark's piece but decided that wasn't good enough. \n\nGiving in to a child's tantrum just creates entitled brats.", "NTA kids need to learn \"No\" and he is a 5 yr old that doesn't need 2 pieces of cake. He already had cake and wanted more, yet when someone offered to share with him it was not good enough which spiraled into a tantrum. It doesn't matter that Ryan was unable to make it. It was set aside with the intent for him to show and you didn't know that he wouldn't be able to. Your sister needs to learn not to give into a five year old despite the tears because if she doesn't it won't stop. Take it from someone who still struggles with hearing the word \"no\" and not getting their way, and I am an adult.", "NTA.

If he had none, then ok but he'd already had some.", "NTA, kid's learning a lesson, he didn't get what he wanted even though he cried and he didn't die over it. Tantrums are part of this stage and really obnoxious so I don't really blame Carrie for wanting to avoid it, but it's for the best.

Not having the cake is probably one of the most important parenting moments for Tim. He needs to learn to think of others and know that sometimes minimal sacrifice on one's part is necessary so that everyone can enjoy things.\n\nPlus, moderation is something kids need to learn, and two cake pieces at 5 years old is highly excessive, specially if he has access to that cake monthly", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

This is something that if they don\u2019t create an environment of discipline then it will only get worse. Yes kids will have a melt down every now and again over something illogical that couldn\u2019t be fixed, or even ones that could because they are overstimulated and tired. Crying because you\u2019re frustrated because you want something you can\u2019t have, understandable for a 5 year old, but not teaching your kid to respect the people and their decisions around you that are based in sound logic is a big problem that\u2019s only going to get bigger. \n\nIt\u2019s teaching that if you behave badly enough you don\u2019t have to respect consent or that if you push hard enough then people will give in and you get what you want. \nNext it will be a toy, then someone who doesn\u2019t want to play is bullied into playing, what about wanting someone test or homework answers, what about a person he likes that doesn\u2019t like him back, what about a person who isn\u2019t ready to have a certain level of intimacy in a relationship, what about when he\u2019s in the workplace and doesn\u2019t want to do his job, etc\u2026.. \n\nThis is a thing that parents need to help a kid understand and also how to deal with disappointment in a healthy way, because crying yourself to sleep isn\u2019t healthy.
