The people in our house were my mom, my stepdad, me (17f), and my stepbrother Mark (17m). Our guests were my stepsister Carrie (28f), her fianc\u00e9, her two stepdaughters (6 and 4) and her son Tim (5) as well as my brother Ryan (21m). \n\nThe guests were welcomed to bring additional food but there were plenty of good things to eat. There were apple pie and ice cream for dessert as well as my mom\u2019s special chocolate cake that everyone loves. She made two of the chocolate cake but accidentally dropped one, leaving only one for the party. \n\nMy brother Ryan goes to college in another city and would drive to join us (1.5 - 2 hour drive). About an hour before we were supposed to meet, Ryan called to let me know his car broke down and he was having a mechanic take a look at it. He said he would be a bit late but he should be able to make it and to save some food for him.\n\nI told everyone of Ryan\u2019s situation. Carrie and her family arrived on time and we had a delicious lunch. I helped slice and serve the chocolate cake - the piece was a bit small but everybody got one. I put Ryan\u2019s share on a plate and covered it to give to him later.\n\nWe chatted as we ate so it was a rather long meal but Ryan still didn\u2019t show up. My mom called him as we were about to have dessert and Ryan said he hoped he could be at home in time for dinner. Everyone accepted that and we dug into the sweets. My mom\u2019s chocolate cake was the first thing that vanished, of course, and we were eating the pie and ice cream when Tim said he wanted more cake.\n\nNow Mark offered to share his 2/3 eaten piece but Tim insisted that there was one more piece and he wanted that one. I told him that it was for Ryan who would join us later. Tim just started shouting that he wanted cake, finally crying. Carrie then asked me if Tim could have the cake, but I insisted it was for Ryan who last enjoyed it during his last visit at Christmas. Carrie comes over at least once a month so there would be plenty of opportunities for Tim to have the cake.\n\nTim cried until he fell asleep and Mark and Carrie\u2019s fianc\u00e9 offered to take care of the children\u2019s nap time while the rest of us clean up. Carrie sulked a little because I refused to give Tim the cake. Then Ryan called me that he couldn\u2019t come anymore because his car problems were more serious than he thought and he would visit us when the car was running again.\n\nAt this point, Carrie was upset that I had saved the cake for a person who didn\u2019t even show up instead of giving it to her son. I told her I could pack it for her to take home or give to Tim after he woke up. She said it would be much better if I offered this before Tim had to cry. I personally thought she spoiled her son a bit much but he was 5 and maybe I could offer him half a piece of the cake I saved for Ryan or something.

Tim already had a piece of cake. Even if the 1 extra slice wasn't being saved for Ryan, Tim's parents should be teaching him that he doesn't get all of every shared resource just because he wants it. You did nothing wrong. Tim's parents need to do a better job parenting.", "NTA and your stepsister is acting no different from her son. She needs to grow up and reprimand her son.", "NTA. That brat needs to learn the word \"No.\" It's a very important lesson for a child to learn: they can't always have everything they want when they want it. \n\nMaybe if Carrie and her fianc\u00e9 ever said \"No\" to their son, he wouldn't have reached the point of crying about it.", "Yeah NTA. Not even a little. That child is being raised to be sure he gets what he wants by crying. He seriously needs to learn to take no for an answer and so does Carrie!", "NTA\n\nSaving a piece for Ryan was a way to mark his inclusion in the family and that he wasn't forgotten even though he was late.\n\nI feel sorry for Tim, but he could've gotten Mark's parts if he really wanted. He didn't, he had his eyes set on Ryan's piece.\n\nTim will have to learn to handle rejection sooner or later. Now it just happened a bit sooner than expected.\n\nThat said, didn't the stepdaughters want any more cake? If I had a slice spare and three young kids I would've asked all of them if they wanted some before giving the last slice to one of them. That could otherwise cause a lot of drama.\n\nYou did the right thing. It sucks Tim got sad, but that slice was saved for a reason, even if that reason got changed later on.\n\nCarrie is a jerk for blaming you over it (and I'm low key concerned she may be favoring Tim over their other kids).", "NTA you seem like a nice person, your stepsister need to learn how to raise her kids", ">She said it would be much better if I offered this before Tim had to cry.\n\nIt would also be better for her to have parented him before he got to \"crying over a second piece of cake\" stage, especially as several compromises were offered, but hey. NTA.", "NTA - Tbh it sounds like bad parenting. He knows if he cries he\u2019ll get whatever he wants.", "Yeah, reward the tantruming child. Maybe she should teach her kid to not be selfish and inconsiderate? This is normal enough for a 5yo, but then it's up to the parent to... parent. \n\nNTA.v", "NTA for trying to make sure everyone got to enjoy this cake. Tim sounds spoiled and seems like mom reinforces it.", "NTA - kid is a brat so is it\u2019s mother", "NTA - Carrie needs to learn to say no to her child.", "LOL OMG, so NTA. Carrie has a pretty bad approach to parenting if, in the midst of a fit where her kid wants an extra serving at the detriment of someone else having a single serving, she'd rather give in and have others accommodate. You were COMPLETELY reasonable, and the fact that Ryan ultimately could not make it has ZERO bearing on how you should have responded to begin with. I have serious doubts about her judgment that she used that after the fact to suggest you were in the wrong. Yeesh I would have been tempted to throw it in the trash to spite them.", "NTA    a 5yr old doesn't need 2 pieces of cake, and he was offered to share Mark's piece but decided that wasn't good enough. \n\nGiving in to a child's tantrum just creates entitled brats.", "NTA kids need to learn \"No\" and he is a 5 yr old that doesn't need 2 pieces of cake. He already had cake and wanted more, yet when someone offered to share with him it was not good enough which spiraled into a tantrum. It doesn't matter that Ryan was unable to make it. It was set aside with the intent for him to show and you didn't know that he wouldn't be able to. Your sister needs to learn not to give into a five year old despite the tears because if she doesn't it won't stop. Take it from someone who still struggles with hearing the word \"no\" and not getting their way, and I am an adult.", "NTA. You didn't know he wasn't going to show and the kid had cake already and was just upset for not getting his way. Parents need to learn to say \"No\" to kids and leave it at that.", "NTA- kid can do without MORE cake. If he had none, then ok but he'd already had some.", "NTA, kid's learning a lesson, he didn't get what he wanted even though he cried and he didn't die over it. Tantrums are part of this stage and really obnoxious so I don't really blame Carrie for wanting to avoid it, but it's for the best. Hopefully if you did pack it up she explained it to him properly and wasn't just like \"mean auntie tried to keep you from your cake but mommy got it for you\".", " NTA he needs to learn the word no. He also needs to understand how to share. He also needs to learn he isn\u2019t going to always get his way.", "NTA\u2026 Tim sounds insufferable and spoiled and that is not your problem", "NTA.\n\nIf the little dude cried until he cried himself to sleep, he was likely cranky and in need of a nap anyhow. Kids don't know to put themselves to bed, they just turn in to little assholes and then pass out. He would have cried over *anything*, the cake was just the catalyst.\n\nHis mom is doing zero favors for anyone by insisting on pacifying him.", "NTA-she needs to parent her child", "NTA. Not having the cake is probably one of the most important parenting moments for Tim. He needs to learn to think of others and know that sometimes minimal sacrifice on one's part is necessary so that everyone can enjoy things.\n\nPlus, moderation is something kids need to learn, and two cake pieces at 5 years old is highly excessive, specially if he has access to that cake monthly", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
