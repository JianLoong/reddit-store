{"id": 25310, "submission_id": "15ytchl", "title": "AITA for locking the bathroom door, regardless of the reason?", "selftext": "I (29M) hopped in the shower before bed. I locked the door because I wanted to rub one out in the shower. It doesn't take me long to do that and I don't do it often. With normal showering activities and that side project included, my shower lasted under 15 minutes. We only have one bathroom for context.\n\nAbout 3 minutes into my shower, my wife (29f) starts knocking on the door. I ask her what she wants, but I can't hear her, so I ignore it. She starts pounding on the door and calling my name, so I ask her again what she wants and she doesn't respond, so I leave it alone again. She starts banging on the door and yelling \"Let me in!\" So I turn off the shower, grab my towel and dry off enough to walk across the bathroom and open the door. \n\nShe asks me why the bathroom door is locked and I say because I want privacy. She says she needs to pee and I should leave the door unlocked when I shower so she can go if she needs to. She said she leaves it unlocked for me incase I need to use it while she's in there.\n\nFor more context, In the years we've been together,, we havnt had this issue because we've had multiple bathrooms. I have also tried peeing in the bathroom she was using to shower and have gotten yelled at for it (she's squeamish) so I'd just use the other from then on. \n\nAnyway, I asked her, how am I supposed to know that we should leave it unlocked? We've never discussed it and I don't expect her to do it for me. I also said she can just hold it, I'm not holding the bathroom hostage, I'm needing 15 minutes at most. I hold it in when she's using the bathroom and I certainly don't demand she stop doing whatever is happening in there so I can take charge of the room. To top it off, her showers and daily prep take at least 30 minutes every morning. I'm fine with it, but I feel like I deserve some time in there uninterrupted. \n\nAll of that aside, I suspect she knew I wasn't just showering and she wanted to confront me about it, but she didnt and I didnt offer up play by plays of what i was doing in there, just that I have a right to privacy and now that we have just one bathroom, we have to figure out how to share it reasonably. Even if she were to confront me about it, I'd still defend my right to do what I want with my body.\n\nI could easily be wrong here, so let me know, AITA?", "created_utc": 1692765496, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15ytchl/aita_for_locking_the_bathroom_door_regardless_of/", "score": 213, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

OR they're using a death grip on their \"little buddy\" and now sex no longer works for them. Does your partner have a reason she's unhappy with you taking care of yourself?\n\nBasically, WHY doesn't she want you masturbating?
