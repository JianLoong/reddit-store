Jane's dad was also hospitalised for over a month and was on ventilator support for 10 days a few months ago. Even with insurance it cost them a lot. Her parents would always ask her to spend a little less, but she would scream at them to send her more money because she bought something with her monthly allowance and has nothing left for the rest of the month. She would also come ask me for advice to spend a little less becasue her parents are angry at her spending habits. She always seems to cut back for a few weeks and then spends all the saved money on something huge. Her little brother on the other hand saves every little bit he can so her parents are not burdened by both of them and even sends her some of his allowance.\n\nRecently she was talking about how her parents are not giving her enough money to buy a new handbag. She said she has about half of the amount needed and she could borrow the rest and then her parents would give her the money as they wouldn't want her to owe anyone money.\n\nThis is where I might be TA- I told her if she continues to do this to her parents she would finish all of their money and that she should learn to be thankful that they were supporting her even now.\n\nShe was really quiet after I said that and hasn't said anything. I think I went too far, but she has 'tried' to stop excessive spending many times and always goes back to her old habits. I have heard her scream at her parents for money (our dorm rooms are next to each other) and it was all too much.\n\nEdit:\nA lot of people said her parents were enabling her. I had a conversation with her a while ago where I mentioned that I was surprised her parents tolerate her screaming and demanding money. She said her parents know her very well and understand that she needs to come to the realisation herself since that was how she was from a young age. Hence they don't cut her off as they know that it won't help her. \n\nAs an example she mentioned that when she was a kid she sucked on her thumb and they asked her not to, but she didn't listen to them. When she started going to school someone made fun of her and she stopped immediately. \n\nI have tried to help her many times over the years, but I'm sad to admit I have no idea how to help her so I think my best choice would be to distance myself and hope she gets better.", "created_utc": 1685514486, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13wednz/aita_for_telling_a_friend_she_would_finish_all/", "score": 496, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She is an entitled brat and needs to be told the reality. You were not mean, simple and direct. But now draw the line and do not involve her in you money matters. Trust me when I say even when they start earning they continue to leech of parents since they have no sense of reality.", "NTA you were being a good friend by telling her the truth. It might not be nice for her to hear but she cannot continue with her spending habits until she is spending her own money from a job.", "NTA. Her parents and brother are enabling her, which will do her no favors in the long run. Don\u2019t be another enabler for her. Real friends tell each other some harsh truths sometimes, and real friends will listen at least even if they don\u2019t agree.", "NTA. She\u2019s a selfish, spoilt child.", "NTA as far as it wasn't really your place to judge, but I agree with you that she's being horrible and selfish. She doesn't need a new handbag or any of that crap and she SHOULD be grateful, as many people would love to have parents to spoil them", "wow NTA. As a friend you should tell her, this behaviour is immature at its finest", "Nta, i hate nothing more than entitled brats.", "NTA. \n\nShe should take on a part-time job if she doesn\u2019t understand the value of money.", "NTA. If we can't count on our friends to give us reality checks when necessary, who can we count on?", "NTA but it\u2019s her parents who should cut the cord and let her feel real life. New dress but no dinner. 23d purse but no tampons. Weekend partying but no pills for headache. \n\nI\u2019m not sure I\u2019d want to be around such a person. If they tell when they don\u2019t get their way\u2026 well not my kind of friend.", "NTA. She needs to learn to live within her monthly allowance and not treat it as a suggestion. Her family are sending her money for essentials - food, rent, university. If she wants luxuries, then she needs to get a job and pay for it herself.\n\nAnd if she's previously tried to cut down and failed, then maybe she also needs to start exploring whether she's addicted to shopping, and see if your university has any free counselling/financial advice resources.", "She had problems with anxiety before exams last year. I got her to talk to a psychiatrist I know and he prescribed some medication for her to use till exams were over and some exercises to do everyday. She took the medicine once and said she didnt need it anymore because she was better (she was not) and she didn't want to use medicines unnecessarily.", "She can't really sell her items because she does not take good care of them. She is very messy and just stuffs everything into bags and pushes them under her bed. I once saw some rotting fruit on her table that had ants crawling over it and she didn't even clean it. I was scared the ants would spread to my room and just cleaned it for her.", "She might be addicted to shopping. She doesn't use a lot of the clothes she buys. They just lie there with their tags still on for months. I have tried to get her help, but she says she is fine and she can stop anytime she wants. She always makes up excuses for 'needing' an item she bought. \nEg: She bought a very expensive hairdryer because she read that wet hair is more prone to breakage. When i asked her why she couldn't just buy a more reasonably priced one she told me that the expensive one doesn't get too hot (even the lower priced models have cold settings)", "[deleted]", "Has she got ADHD? Impulsivity, messiness...", "She isn't right, because she wasn't better. The medication was only intended to be until exams were over, at which point they could have started working on the root of the problem - but right before exams isn't the time to start that.", "She refuses to go to a doctor even though we are literally in med school. I got her to speak to a psychiatrist I know over the phone once and he asked me to get her to a psychiatrist in person because she may have something and he was sure she needed more help (didn't tell me what because of confidentiality and because he couldn't be sure over the phone)", "[deleted]", "Unfortunately there are a lot of stigma attached to mental health, I am also guessing that she might be worried about the impact on her career. The sad thing is that having a diagnosis could help her manage her symptoms better. If there is a chemical imbalance, or she is neurodivergent, ignoring it won't change the facts, but certainly it is making life harder for herself and others. She could get support from the school and adaptation, which would give her a better chance to achieve her goals. Certainly, for me, having a diagnosis made a great difference. There are simple tests online that can be done (e.g. ADHD) worth looking into, you could even do it together. I would also tell her that understanding herself better means that she will be much better equipped to help others.", "She would be right in general not to overuse meds, but that's not what seems to be happening here. She's using the excuse of not wanting to overuse meds in order to avoid following a professional medical expert's treatment plan.", "Thanks doc", "NTA I also come from a culture where parents support their kids through college and I have seen so many people suffer when they enter workforce because they don't know how to manage their money properly. They're caught up in the bougie lifestyle that they can't afford. It'll come crashing down on them at one point.", "NTA but TBH, i feel like you shouldnt get involved much, i know shes your friend but family issues should stay within the family", "I don't say anything generally, but she keeps asking me for advice to cut back on spending and complains about her parents not giving her enough money and I've also spoken to her parents who have asked me to 'teach her'.", "Using medication as directed is not \u201coverusing\u201d it. She was directed how to take it. She didn\u2019t take it. She was underusing it.", "NTA. She's on a budget and keeps going over it. Since she's asked you to borrow cash several times you definitely get to give your opinion on her spending habits.", "If you truly care about this person, I would hold up a mirror to them and show them just how entitled they are being. If they have a shopping issue then she needs help. There are shopping 12 step groups, and therapists that work with that issue. \n\nNTA but right now your friend truly is.", "YNTA.\nJane is.Sounds like Jane is a spoiled, entitled brat who thinks her parents owe her everything she wants, even things that she doesn\u2019t need and are frivolous.\nJane is selfish.", "I come from one of those cultures too (never seen anyone here in Italy do anything more than tutoring/TAing or the occasional few-days-long job while in high school/uni, there's just not enough time to keep up with our workload and have a proper job) but I've never seen people act like that at university age unless they have extremely wealthy parents. Frankly, it's embarrassing for OP's friend that she's so immature.", "NTA\n\n\nyour friend is acting like one big time though. Sounds like she's not doing it on purpose, but that doesn't take away from the fact that she does. Shopping addiction is still an addiction and she needs serious help.\n\n\nGlad that she has an honest friend like you, and hopefully her staying silent for a moment was a reality check hearing it from someone who's not within her family.", "NTA I'm sure there's a movie like 'Confessions of a shopaholic' you might want to watch together. It sounds like she has an addiction that is being enabled by her family.", "NTA. You are fighting a difficult battle. You are trying to make your friend accountable for her actions and how they hurt her family. Be prepared to lose your friend over this. Accountability is not something most young people are willing to accept.", "NTA, it sounds like she has an addiction, research the term for when someone is addicted to shopping. What you said was correct, but if that sank in or not will be seen in time. She needs professional help.", "NTA but parents only have themselves to blame for enabling her", "NTA", "NTA. My parents supported me through university - in UK before there were big fees so the main expense was rent and food. I didn't splurge my money on shopping because I didn't want to be asking them for money constantly.", "NTA.  You prolly lost a friend.  But, do you really want a friendship like that?", "She is not someone I\u2019d encourage you to continue to associate with as she screamed at her dying father over a handbag. \n\nDisgraceful. You are a good friend to try to get her to stop. Now be a good friend to yourself and get some space. \n\nNta", "NTA. Let it play out, without involving yourself. \n\nI think eventually her parents will tire of being screamed at, and giving her money, and will cut her off fully.", "Sad to say that it has made absolutely no difference.", "I made her watch it and she loved it. She fails to recognise that she has a lot of similarities.", "He recovered fully and is alright. The hospitalisation happened a few months before this event. The screaming isn't a one time occurence and has happened about four or five times that I know of, but not when her dad was hospitalised.", "Excessive spending can also be a sign of some MH issues...", "Might be one of the smarter decisions she's made.", "You can't. Someone above mentioned ADHD. She's a very clear case of what happens to an adult left untreated (with medication or with cbt). Also, you're not her therapist. Of course, that's just my theory without knowing her, but such things are frequently seen in such patients (I'm a neuropsychologist). \n\n\nNext time she comes up asking for advice, it might be a good idea to say: \"My only suggestion is that you get help from a mental health professional or get assessed by a neurologist for adhd.\" That's it. Don't engage otherwise. Repeat over and over: \"Sorry, I can't help you.\" \n\n\nTo the parents when they ask such things: \"I'm afraid her condition is not my area of expertise.\" \n\n\nIt's sad, yeah, but you're not her doctor, her therapist, or her parent. Remove yourself from this situation. You're NTA.", "Forgive me. However my point is the same. Her parents would live longer if they cut her off. That\u2019s not someone I\u2019d be around.", "Holy crap, based on what you are saying, the last thing she should be is a doctor. Oh man, I feel for anyone who would be her patient.", "Thank you for noticing the irony.", "NTA- She asked and you gave her an honest answer. If she asks why you are distancing yourself be honest again. I had to put space between my and a childhood friend for the same reason. Took her a couple years and a few more friends before she got the hint. Shes much better and I'm glad she worked on herself.", "NTA", "NTA\nHer parrets should in all honesty cut her off 100%\nShe needs to learn the value of money the hard way.. she will never learn if she keeps getting anything at all", "NTA. Part of the experience of growing up is being exposed to different world views and perspectives from other peers and individuals than just your family unit.\n\nThat being said, \u201cnot your clowns. Not your circus.\u201d It isn\u2019t your job to help her. You said your piece, now I\u2019d just let her sink or swim. She\u2019ll either get her shit together, or she won\u2019t and thats going to be increasingly her problem and not yours, her parents, or anyone else\u2019s (hopefully unless she finds new people to enable her).", "NTA! Shad to hear it, and the reason she went quiet after that is because u striked a nerve. She knows ur right but just doesn't want to admit it. And for her to be speaking to her parents like that after everything they have done and continue to do for her is just totally appalling. \n\n She is totally spoiled, has never been told no, and now her parents are suffering the consequences. \n\n If she doesn't stop this entitled behaviour towards her parents, she WILL kill her father. And let's see how she likes to be the cause of her father's desth", "NTA\n\nMy aunt was like this for a huge chunk of my life. She'd periodically call up my grandparents and my aunts and uncles and request money for any number of reasons, and then throw a tantrum when denied. Of course the money was going to drugs, but then again shopping addiction and affluenza are a thing.\n\nYeah, her parents should just cut her off cold turkey I think, but I get why they don't, because it is difficult to deal with someone so intent on screaming you down. Even if they just turned off their phones she'd likely make the trip down on what little she had left to make a scene in their yard, because that sounds like she'd be the type.\n\nGirl needs a reality check badly.", "cutting her off absolutely will help her. can\u2019t overspend if you literally don\u2019t have the money. \n\nNTA. holy enabling parents, Batman.", "Start making fun of her spending.", "Your friend is spoiled and the parents did it by giving in to her tantrums.\n\nNTA", "NTA. You basically did the same thing as the kid who made fun of her for sucking her thumb, except you weren't even trying to be mean - you just stated a fact. If she's going to use that thumb-sucking story as an example of what kind of person she is and how she learns, there is absolutely no logic to her being upset with you for the warning you gave her. You were just trying to teach her in the only way she claims works for her, which is peers whose opinion matters to her pointing out when she's behaving immaturely.", "NTA. As a friend, sometimes we just have to give them a reality check if they need it. While your friend is definitely spoiled, I can only blame her parents for that. I can say that it's honestly lazy parenting because they just don't want to deal with actually teaching their kid about good spending habits. You can help her all you want, but don't emotionally drain yourself OP. I've had friends who come to me for advice over and over again but don't want to listen to reason and eventually regret their decisions. Also, if it comes up, don't involve money in your friendship. She might treat you the way she treats her parents.", "Her parents are enabling her- as are you by loaning her money and her brother by sending her money. You all need to stop.", "Evidently the psychiatrist agrees with you as her friend was given meds. OP you were 100% correct, she is being a spend thrift and will blow through her parents money. Frankly, the parents need to cut her off and directly pay for school necessities like tuition and books themselves so that she can't buy expensive purses or other completely unnecessary baubles. NTA But there's not much you can do as this is on her parents for obviously spoiling her.", "I have loaned her money once and told her I wouldn't again. She wasn't talking about taking money from me for the bag, but from some of her other friends.", "It isn\u2019t your job to help her. You said your piece, now I\u2019d just let her sink or swim."]}
