I'll call the friend Jane. \n\nJane and I go to the same college. We have been friends for 7 years now. We are not from the USA and it is common for parents to financially support their kids through college here. So we don't have jobs and our parents pay for everything till we start working so we can concentrate better on our classes. Jane has always loved shopping. If she likes something she has to buy it even if she can not afford it.\n\nJane's parents are paying her and her brother's college fees which are both pretty pricey. Jane's dad was also hospitalised for over a month and was on ventilator support for 10 days a few months ago. Even with insurance it cost them a lot. Her parents would always ask her to spend a little less, but she would scream at them to send her more money because she bought something with her monthly allowance and has nothing left for the rest of the month. She would also come ask me for advice to spend a little less becasue her parents are angry at her spending habits. She always seems to cut back for a few weeks and then spends all the saved money on something huge. Her little brother on the other hand saves every little bit he can so her parents are not burdened by both of them and even sends her some of his allowance.\n\nRecently she was talking about how her parents are not giving her enough money to buy a new handbag. She said she has about half of the amount needed and she could borrow the rest and then her parents would give her the money as they wouldn't want her to owe anyone money.\n\nThis is where I might be TA- I told her if she continues to do this to her parents she would finish all of their money and that she should learn to be thankful that they were supporting her even now.\n\nShe was really quiet after I said that and hasn't said anything. I think I went too far, but she has 'tried' to stop excessive spending many times and always goes back to her old habits. I have heard her scream at her parents for money (our dorm rooms are next to each other) and it was all too much.", "created_utc": 1685514486, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13wednz/aita_for_telling_a_friend_she_would_finish_all/", "score": 38, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She needs a reality check and sounds very entitled, the problem is that her parents are enabling her. She is at risk of her brother and family resenting her. She could also do with learning to budget and put money aside for something that matter. She could also sell some items of hers to fund new ones.\n\nHowever, I also wander if she could be using shopping as a coping mechanism in the same way than others use food to deal with emotions?", "You gave her solid advice just like a good friend should.

She is an entitled brat and needs to be told the reality. You were not mean, simple and direct. But now draw the line and do not involve her in you money matters. Trust me when I say even when they start earning they continue to leech of parents since they have no sense of reality.", "NTA you were being a good friend by telling her the truth. It might not be nice for her to hear but she cannot continue with her spending habits until she is spending her own money from a job.", "NTA. Her parents and brother are enabling her, which will do her no favors in the long run. Don\u2019t be another enabler for her. Real friends tell each other some harsh truths sometimes, and real friends will listen at least even if they don\u2019t agree.", "NTA. She\u2019s a selfish, spoilt child.", "NTA as far as it wasn't really your place to judge, but I agree with you that she's being horrible and selfish. She doesn't need a new handbag or any of that crap and she SHOULD be grateful, as many people would love to have parents to spoil them", "wow NTA. As a friend you should tell her, this behaviour is immature at its finest", "Nta, i hate nothing more than entitled brats.", "NTA. \n\nShe should take on a part-time job if she doesn\u2019t understand the value of money.", "NTA. If we can't count on our friends to give us reality checks when necessary, who can we count on?", "NTA but it\u2019s her parents who should cut the cord and let her feel real life. New dress but no dinner. 23d purse but no tampons. Weekend partying but no pills for headache. \n\nI\u2019m not sure I\u2019d want to be around such a person. If they tell when they don\u2019t get their way\u2026 well not my kind of friend.", "NTA. She needs to learn to live within her monthly allowance and not treat it as a suggestion. Her family are sending her money for essentials - food, rent, university. If she wants luxuries, then she needs to get a job and pay for it herself.\n\nAnd if she's previously tried to cut down and failed, then maybe she also needs to start exploring whether she's addicted to shopping, and see if your university has any free counselling/financial advice resources.", "She had problems with anxiety before exams last year. I got her to talk to a psychiatrist I know and he prescribed some medication for her to use till exams were over and some exercises to do everyday. She took the medicine once and said she didnt need it anymore because she was better (she was not) and she didn't want to use medicines unnecessarily.", "She can't really sell her items because she does not take good care of them. She is very messy and just stuffs everything into bags and pushes them under her bed. I once saw some rotting fruit on her table that had ants crawling over it and she didn't even clean it. I was scared the ants would spread to my room and just cleaned it for her.", "She might be addicted to shopping. She doesn't use a lot of the clothes she buys. They just lie there with their tags still on for months. I have tried to get her help, but she says she is fine and she can stop anytime she wants. She always makes up excuses for 'needing' an item she bought. \nEg: She bought a very expensive hairdryer because she read that wet hair is more prone to breakage. When i asked her why she couldn't just buy a more reasonably priced one she told me that the expensive one doesn't get too hot (even the lower priced models have cold settings)", "She's right, medicine usage in her case seems unnecessary, however she could use therapy or start doing relaxation/meditation/yoga to help with her anxiety. Med doesnt solve the root of the problem (unless it's deficit and the med fills that), only covers it. There's something behind her behaviour and she needs Help to figure it out.", "Has she got ADHD? Impulsivity, messiness...", "She isn't right, because she wasn't better. The medication was only intended to be until exams were over, at which point they could have started working on the root of the problem - but right before exams isn't the time to start that.", "She refuses to go to a doctor even though we are literally in med school. I got her to speak to a psychiatrist I know over the phone once and he asked me to get her to a psychiatrist in person because she may have something and he was sure she needed more help (didn't tell me what because of confidentiality and because he couldn't be sure over the phone)", "Let me rephrase it: she would be right in general to not overuse meds. (Note: I'm not a native speaker)", "Unfortunately there are a lot of stigma attached to mental health, I am also guessing that she might be worried about the impact on her career. The sad thing is that having a diagnosis could help her manage her symptoms better. If there is a chemical imbalance, or she is neurodivergent, ignoring it won't change the facts, but certainly it is making life harder for herself and others. She could get support from the school and adaptation, which would give her a better chance to achieve her goals. Certainly, for me, having a diagnosis made a great difference. There are simple tests online that can be done (e.g. ADHD) worth looking into, you could even do it together. I would also tell her that understanding herself better means that she will be much better equipped to help others.", "She would be right in general not to overuse meds, but that's not what seems to be happening here. She's using the excuse of not wanting to overuse meds in order to avoid following a professional medical expert's treatment plan.", "Thanks doc"]}
