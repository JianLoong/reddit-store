She is also married with 3 kids (all under 12), her husband is unemployed, she works retail and they have a ton of medical debt.\n\nI guess she has been going through my social media lately, and she has seen how we celebrate Christmas in our house. Then she contacted me, after a couple of minutes she said that they were planning to spend Christmas with us as a *gift*. I said that I appreciated her gesture, but that Christmas for us is just for our small family, we do not like to include the extended family.\n\nShe kept insisting that it would be *fun* and that my kids would *absolutely love to celebrate with their cousins*; my kids have never even met their cousins. I kept insisting that it would not be possible for us, then she switched tones and started telling me that they couldn\u2019t afford Christmas for their kids, that they just wanted the kids to have a fun holiday for once. I sympathized with her, but told her-again- that it would not be possible for them to spend Christmas with us. \n\nThen she asked me for some money to help with Christmas expenses, I told her that we do not have any extra funds this month, but that I have a $100 budgeted for gifts for her family that I could send her. She asked for more but I turned her down.\n\nThat was when she got angry at me, she said that I was a selfish bitch, that it wasn\u2019t fair that her kids would not get to celebrate Christmas while I am throwing money out the window on my vanity project of a house.\n\nI hanged up on her, then sent her a text, this is the exact text: \u201cI am sorry that you and your family are struggling, but I will not be sacrificing our family traditions for your ease.

This is how you get \"no contact\" like you just did.\n\nAnd the $100 is very generous.  I wonder why her husband is unemployed.  That is likely part of the reason why they are not having a good Christmas.  \n\nAnd many of your \"vanity\" projects for Christmas can be done fairly inexpensively yet look pricey, especially if you Do It Yourself and get goods at sales and thrift stores.

Why is it impossible? Is it something that you and your husband are never open to the possibility of spending Christmas with your sister and her family had she not just invited herself and family? Would the kids not like to meet and spend time with their cousins/Aunt/uncle? I completely understand family traditions, we have them ourselves, but they way your worded it I think is what jumped out at me?
