She is also married with 3 kids (all under 12), her husband is unemployed, she works retail and they have a ton of medical debt.\n\nI guess she has been going through my social media lately, and she has seen how we celebrate Christmas in our house. Then she contacted me, after a couple of minutes she said that they were planning to spend Christmas with us as a *gift*. I said that I appreciated her gesture, but that Christmas for us is just for our small family, we do not like to include the extended family.\n\nShe kept insisting that it would be *fun* and that my kids would *absolutely love to celebrate with their cousins*; my kids have never even met their cousins. I kept insisting that it would not be possible for us, then she switched tones and started telling me that they couldn\u2019t afford Christmas for their kids, that they just wanted the kids to have a fun holiday for once. I sympathized with her, but told her-again- that it would not be possible for them to spend Christmas with us. \n\nThen she asked me for some money to help with Christmas expenses, I told her that we do not have any extra funds this month, but that I have a $100 budgeted for gifts for her family that I could send her. She asked for more but I turned her down.\n\nThat was when she got angry at me, she said that I was a selfish bitch, that it wasn\u2019t fair that her kids would not get to celebrate Christmas while I am throwing money out the window on my vanity project of a house.\n\nI hanged up on her, then sent her a text, this is the exact text: \u201cI am sorry that you and your family are struggling, but I will not be sacrificing our family traditions for your ease.

Would the kids not like to meet and spend time with their cousins/Aunt/uncle? I completely understand family traditions, we have them ourselves, but they way your worded it I think is what jumped out at me?

Not sure why people feel they are entitled to whatever it is someone else has. You did well on not accepting 'her gift' and I'm impressed you did not give in. I think you are very generous to still send her the 100 dollar, so good for you. Please let is go, you are not at fault here.\n\nWishing you a very merry Christmas :-)", "NTA. She is entitled for no reason whatsoever.", "NTA. She just seen how much money you could have and wanted to be included in good gifts and such. Your sister is a leech, I\u2019d recommend going NC with her again.. she\u2019s trying to use you.", "NTA. How you celebrate Christmas is your business. All she wanted to do was hone in on a planned event she had no part in preparing because she didn't make any sort of preparations herself.", "NTA.. how is inviting THEMSELVES BEFORE talking to her sis a gift and ok?? lmfaooo! And the audacity to say its THEIR GIFT TO THEM\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 No wonder OP went NC for more than 10 yrs!! I wouldnt send a penny if i was OP!! The disrespect, audacity, entittlement n demanding gives a glimpse as to why OP has been NC!!", "NTA.  Sister is just an entitled leech. Time to go no contact again for you and your family", "Nta", "NTA - this request is incredibly inappropriate based on the relationship the two of you share. And while I understand the sense of urgency, she feels, it\u2019s not your responsibility to supplement her in these difficult times if you\u2019re unable to. She\u2019s likely quite angry with herself, and it\u2019s easier to project on to you.", "NTA\n\n> she said that I was a selfish bitch, that it wasn\u2019t fair that her kids would not get to celebrate Christmas while I am throwing money out the window on my vanity project of a house.\n\nAnd there it is. \u201cYour time and money should be spent on ME, not your own family\u201d\n\nCalling someone vain is also absolutely an insult. \n\nWhy would you welcome someone in to your home who insulted you and your home? Especially since it\u2019s pretty damn clear she only contacted you to try and squeeze money out of your family? The whole \u201cspending time with you as a gift\u201d was a sham from the start. And yikes, the sheer ego of that statement. You spend time with people because you care about them, not because you think your presence is so amazing it\u2019s a gift they should thank you for, and then shower you with money.\n\nI\u2019m sorry you have such a terrible sister.", "NTA.   You just prevented your families Christmas from being ruined and potentially, a lot more going wrong with an envious and entitled sister seeking more and more from you.   Good job on protecting your family.", "**NTA** these people are relative strangers to you. You politely set your boundaries. Only then does a completely new motive emerge. She may be hard up but is still trying to use you. Don't feel bad about saying no. I admire your restraint.", "Nta she tried to invite herself to your event.", "NTA.\n\nYour sister let her jealously get the better of her and she treated you horribly when her misplaced entitlement was not met.  Your boundaries are reasonable and I think you did a fantastic job of expressing them.  Some people might find it a bit cold but I know from experience that you have to be very clear, short and non-emotional with people who react so inappropriately emotional over being told no otherwise it escalates. \n\nIt's very nice of you to still gift them the money you set aside for their gifts.  I hope she responds more appropriately when she calms down.", "NTA. Maybe her husband could get a job?", "I feel for her kids but it's her place to get angry that you're not inviting her and her kids over. Especially since you're already going to send her money to help her out. She should do some self reflection and appreciate the help.  NTA", "This seemed to be leading up to the Christmas Vacation movie. Good you for sticking to your boundaries OP. NTA and Merry Christmas to you and your family.", "NTA.  There was a reason you were NC for her for so long.  Reconnecting may not have been a great idea.", "NTA, you and your immediate family get to choose how you spend the holidays. Her actions were disingenuous and conniving and you don\u2019t need people like that marring your holiday.", "NTA\n\nShe came out with her hand out for $$$, obviously....not for family togetherness.  So nope her out.  If she wants the family the most of all, do it on other day instead of holidays.", "NTA. What an entitled person! She isn't entitled to your time or money just because you're related.", "NTA. I am sorry OP, I think she wanted to reconnect with you for all the wrong reasons.", "NTA Nobody has the right to invite themselves to your house, and if someone has the audacity to do so, it's not safe to invite them.", "NTA\n\nWell, you tried. Back to NC for her.", "NTA - while your wording is blunt, it sounds like you tried a softer approach and that wasn't working. Sometimes a bit of candor is the best way to set a clear boundary.   \n\n\nI empathize with your sister falling on harder times and how hard that can be, especially at xmas - but you don't owe her anything and your $100 is quite generous as is (especially b/c you don't have a close relationship with her). I would be wary of her sense of entitlement if your relationship continues after this.", "NTA\n\nAnd you probably should go back NC", "NTA.\n\n\"No\" was a complete answer and she insisted on pushing and attempting to guilt you. Shame on her. Time to go NC with sis, too.", "NTA you share biology but you haven't spoken in years then she is pulling this after one meeting, no.  You say yes this year and it will be every holiday going forward.", "NTA. \n\nYou handled that exactly right, no edits. \n\nNow just stick with what you said and don't feel guilty at all.", "NTA\n\nYou worded it perfectly.", "NTA", "NTA but demanding apologies rarely works. They are empty, so she will either keep harassing you, or go silent once more.", "Technically, you don't have to invite anyone you don't want too. And your sister is being rude. But, I don't see how Christmas is only \"magical\" if you only include your immediate family. Maybe make watching the Grinch one of your family traditions.\n\n\u201cIt came without ribbons, it came without tags.

You don\u2019t owe anybody anything.", "I'm not reading any other answers before I respond.  NTA!!  They come to visit you for Christmas then never move out.  I've actually seen this happen to a friend of mine.  Worst choice ever.  Celebrate with your family alone.  Don't let anyone guilt you into sharing.  You don't have to send them $100 but you are doing it out of the goodness of your heart.  Be strong.", "I feel for your sister's plight. But, you've done nothing wrong. And she was wrong to make this about you having more and sharing what you have.\n\nNTA. She'd be on my Grinch list after pulling a stunt like that. But, since I love my sisters and need them in my life - I'd tell myself, \"She made a mistake. Don't make a bigger one by being a jerk to her.\"\n\nIf you don't need your sister like you need oxygen - then just give her some room until you can stand to deal with her BS?", "NTA you don't owe her anything. Tell her to go back to school for certifications or look for other training programs. Hell if she is in the states you can send me the county and state she lives in and and if she has a HS diploma I can send you different things she can do to better her situation", "That sounds like a totally reasonable boundary.  NTA.\n\nAnd you and your husband sound like you are doing great at building a good life for yourselves.  Congratulations.", "NTA. You are doing a great job protecting your little family from toxic relatives, & were much more generous than I would have been.", "Good for you OP!!!\n\nI also have toxic/abusive family that I've cut contact with. My sister is the last person I still talk with but she is a lot like yours. Calls when she wants something from me. I've recently started setting up boundaries, they really hate that. \n\nNTA and I hope you and your family have a very magical Christmas.", "NTA- It\u2019s too bad about your sister\u2019s situation, it\u2019s not hard to understand where her emotions would be. Since you two have been very LC for a while for her to just try to invite herself and her family to your Christmas celebrations is a Huge leap! After you said no (multiple times)she came at you with all her anger and jealousy. I would not feel guilty after her harsh words to you. Merry Christmas!", "NTA.\n\nYou are an inspiration.", "NTA, you handled this situation perfectly.", "Actually im not saying you're wrong but if i was in your place i could've at least asked her to send the kids or helped her with the deco nd food you said it yr self they have some medical debts and i thought holidays are for good actions...  Not because she's your sister cause even if it was a stanger, exceptions exists when it comes to kids who live in poor conditions nd can't really have a nice holiday... U know tht the 100 u sent her will be used to pay some of the debts nd not as a gift for the kids...  \nAgain you're NTA neither she's \nHer words were wrong but it doesn't mean she's a bad person she may be stressed her kids will be sad nd compare them selves to others in school .... \nLife is  colorful not only in black and white", "NTA, but maybe don\u2019t show off your Christmas on steroids on social media.  You\u2019re going to make a lot of people depressed.", "NAH, you handled that situation with great civility given what she said to you. I applaud your restraint.", "Right? Also how much you want to bet she\u2019d expect op to buy extra presents for her kids so they don\u2019t feel left out?\n\nSo you said you reconnected last year? Was it over social media? Thinking she reached out just cause she saw you were doing better and might be a good mark. NTA- this woman is just a leech-\nYou reacted exactly right and stick to your guns- the more you give\nInto this woman the more she\u2019s gonna expect.", "But they were going to OP's house as a gift /s", "Also, just to note it, not only is it fine that OP set this boundaries, but in terms of her concern for her tone, she was actually amazingly polite given the situation!

I\u2019ve got indoor wreaths, garlands, candles, a 6.5\u2019 tree, pillowcases, blankets, advent calendars. The whole shebang. Everything we have out gets put into storage tubs and tucked away each year to be reused. \n\nThe only things I buy each year are candy, new candles, and fresh/live decor (tree, outside wreaths). $130 spent but only because I went a little extra on candles. Thanks Target. \n\nThe wonder of holidays isn\u2019t terribly hard to do as long as you have a base for it. Dollar stores have great decorations for folks on a more serious budget, and if a family is truly struggling most areas (in the USA at least) have adopt a family drives during Christmas. We were adopted multiple times when I was a kid/teen, and those anonymous donors were living angels. \n\nEveryone should adopt a child or family at Christmas if they can spare it! \u2764\ufe0f", "I assumed the unemployment may have something to do with the medical Bill's.

Currently my tree is decoration heavy on the bottom half because that\u2019s where the kids can reach. And some of the cookies turn out weird because the kids helped with them too.
