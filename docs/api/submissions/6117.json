I told her this but she said that when they started looking for a new place that everything else was too expensive and it made for sense for me to move out and not her. I refused and told her that she can always ask the landlord if there will be units available for them in our building. She started cussing me out and has had her fianc\u00e9 and their friends harassing me about it.

Perhaps you could suggest that if saving for roomie's wedding is the priority, rather than you moving out, your mother could just make a financial contribution to the wedding fund?", "NTA. These are all \"them\" problems. If they are harassing you and cursing at you, the friendship is likely over. And why would you do a favor for someone who is not your friend?", "NTA.

Just because they got engaged does not mean that the world is gonna come together and put them at some secret, super-special treatment, priority list.\nLife is still gonna happen on life's terms.\nThey need to cultivate that and not by force or manipulation, bullying, guilt tripping, yelling etc.", "NTA\n\nYour mom sure is though.\n\n You lived there first so really I think you have first dibs if one roommate needs to leave. Moving is expensive. It isn't something that one does lightly.\n\nYour roommate sounds like a bully.

LL/T law varies a lot by state but it's probably the case that neither of you have any ability to force the other to move. \n\nEach of you is free to stay or leave unless you are evicted. Your decision to stay or leave might might affect hers and vice versa (e.g., if you say you are definitely staying she can decide whether to stay or leave in light of that), but nobody can compel anyone.\n\nDon't try to tell her what to do. Just tell her what you are going to do.\n\nProtect yourself and your property and be prepared for whatever you think might realistically happen. If she does anything that crosses a line that you think might constitute unlawful conduct you should contact a lawyer immediately, and if she does anything you think is criminal (especially anything violent or destructive) you should be mentally prepared to call the police. You don't want to wait too long to do that if it becomes necessary.", "NTA \n\nThis energy that single people should suffer for couples to benefit is some serious bullshit.", "NTA.", "You should contact the landlord and tell him you want to go ahead and renew the lease now and be done with it.

They need to save for their wedding as if that is a need-to-have and not a nice-to-have.. you have zero to do with any of that.", "NTA and her comment doesn't make sense except for her and her fiance. The two of them, with their combined income, are more likely to be able to afford the more expensive places out there than you would be by yourself.", "NTA.  At all.  Why on earth should you support them?  Moving will cost you a ton of money and stress.  Tell them all to F off with that nonsense.  Tell your landlord you aren\u2019t moving in case she tries to do something shady.", "I would get something in WRITING with the landlord that you intend to say and renew the lease.

They were fine moving out until they realized the cost so now they want to shift the cost over to you. \n\nI'm appalled that your own mother supports this.", "Absolutely NTA. You had the apartment first. You made plans and clearly communicated them. They can ask, you can say no. They\u2019re being rude and entitled and they can stay mad.", " INFO: whose name is in the lease as lessee? \n\nDo the other roommates have a sublease agreement with the lessor?", "NTA. 100% not. Your roommate can ask which she did but she then needs to accept the answer and most definitely crossed the line when she started cussing you out and getting others to harass you. \nI\u2019m also concerned you Mum thinks people she doesn\u2019t know deserve your home more than you do?!?  She\u2019s also a bit of an arsehole.", "Why on earth would you move out if you don't want to? They can find a place just as easily as you could and you've already made your plans to live there alone. I can't see a single angle for argument here. NTA", "NTA! Anyone, to include your mother, who thinks you should give up your apartment, that you\u2019ve lived in for 4 years, and before her, can take up a collection for your roommate and her fianc\u00e9s new place and then proceed to shove it up their ass. WTF is wrong with the entitlement of people today. Rhetorical question!", "This is one of the most clear cut ones I've read in a while, OP. I didn't even have to think about this for a second your NTA. Why should you have to move out and  pay more on a single income? You already had an agreement in place, they are all literally just bullying you now in hopes you'll cave, getting their friends involved is evidence of this. They don't give a damn about you and don't care if you can't afford to live elsewhere. Don't fall for it OP. Unless they start threatening you, making your life a living hell etc. Dont give your home for them.", "NTA but since youre still living w them for a few more months, please be very careful.", "NTA.  So basically she wants you to be the one to have to find a new place instead of her because other places are too expensive.  It makes no sense for her to say that you should be the one to find a new place.  Plus, why can't they live together in fianc\u00e9's current place?", "NTA. It\u2019s fine to ask it\u2019s fucked up to not accept being told no.", "NTA your mom sounds like she wants to take them", "NTA  be careful that the landlord will not sign with them behind your back so do something now!

Record video walk thru of all common areas and your bedroom at least weekly, and everytime an issue arises to CYA.", "NTA. Maybe see if you can presign the next lease now so it goes into effect instantly when the other expires? At a minimum refresh the memory of your landlord.", "NTA. They\u2019re the ones who decided to change their living dynamic, not you.\n\nThey can have a cheaper wedding.", "NTA. Don\u2019t leave. You are absolutely right. They should be the ones to go. The nerve.", "NTA, your roommate & her BF could care less how much moving to a new apartment could affect you financially.  They can both pound sand for being so entitled.", "Nta, V and her fiance are entitled AHs. Even if she hadn't previously agreed to move out, you have lived there longer than her. You should not be expected to uproot your life simply based on her whim.", "NTA. You have dibs. It wouldn\u2019t hurt though to quietly look around for another apartment. You just may find something better and avoid the drama. And if you don\u2019t, then you can dig in and stay.", "NTA\n\nI really don't understand people who harass on behalf of friends. \nIf a friend asked me, I would talk them out of it.", "NTA and wow the audacity of those two. Complaining that it's expensive elsewhere ( as a couple ) but wanting you to find a place to live by yourself? And/or having to all of a sudden find a new roomie too. F them.", "The lease is in your name? Talk to the landlord ya da lawyer about evicting them. It\u2019s your apartment not hers she just the roommate. Start  keeping track of harassment and file police reports. Your Mom is ridiculous, their finances and their wedding aren\u2019t your problem. If they were so worried about saving she wouldn\u2019t be harassing you to leave and take half the rent money. Start working on getting them out.", "NTA. They can find a new place. You were very much \u2018there first\u2019", "NTA - keep us posted if you can renew your lease early. good luck\ud83d\ude0a", "NTA Sign the lease renewal with just you and the landlord now to prevent her from doing anything later.", "NTA, and I\u2019d ask the landlord how soon can you sign your new solo lease.", "NTA. I'm surprised by their audacity. Keep record of the harassment if you can and speak with your landlord about the situation. Make sure that they know you'll be taking over alone. Usually, landlords prefer single tenants if they can and you've lived there for 4 years so they must think you're a good tenant. Good luck.\nEdit:typo", "NTA\n\nWhy is it always couples that get all the advantages? It's freaking easier finding new places with 2 incomes, even if everything else wasn't already in your favour this would tip the balance. Keep your stance and check in again with the landlord since you already had previous agreement.", "NTA at all. You don't have to move out just because it's convenient for them. They even agreed to move out but reneged.", "NTA", "NTA. It is not your responsibility to give up your place to help out a couple that wants a cheaper place. It is beyond ridiculous for her to make a fuss about that and I would 100% keep the place even if it is just because of the principle.", "NTA. I\u2019m confused about why your mother is in favor of shifting an increase in rent and moving expenses from your roommate to you because you aren\u2019t engaged. Single people aren\u2019t required to take on burdens to make it easier for other people to pay for their wedding.", "NTA, and the fact that they can't afford to find another place, as 2 income providers, but they can afford to get married is very interesting. If the landlord already agreed to let you live alone, then I'd stand my ground, and possibly get a lawyer cuz these 2 seem psycho enough to try to force is (by harassment and maybe even physically)", "NTA", "NTA. Quick question. Is your roommate also on the lease contract? If so, let her know she either quits with her shit or you'll have her out of the street in a few hours. If you are the sole person on the lease you can simply call the cops to come kick her and her fiance out.", "Yeah. Just go.", "I have no idea how to upvote this more!!!", "This is what gets me lol, like the audacity", "Came here to say the same thing.  The gall of them.  OP is NTA", "When I asked my roommate months back about her moving out and she said she would I did have her confirm with the landlord that she would not be resigning the lease.", "Absolutely you don\u2019t want the landlord evicting you on some lie they\u2019re telling just to get their way. If you\u2019ve always been a good tenant and paid the rent on time he\u2019s likely to stick with you than tenants who start out by causing trouble.", "Or that they come and stay with her whilst they're saving, mwahahah", "This. \u201cOh, we want to save money, so we\u2019re going to make you go spend more money to live elsewhere\u201d. No. NTA OP, keep the apartment", "Seriously! Also why is their wedding OP\u2019s problem? OP isn\u2019t the one getting married. No one told these two to get engaged and you don\u2019t need to get married right away after getting engaged. You could simply wait until you\u2019re in a better spot financially to have like the whole wedding! They could even just get married like at the courthouse and then later have the wedding party", "I\u2019m sure OPs mom is the type to push someone out of their own bed bc a *couple* should have it and makes the person who is single, and who owns the bed, sleep on the couch instead. Becoming a couple doesn\u2019t give you magical access to everything you want. They\u2019ve got their love, YOU KEEP THE HOUSING. \n\nNTA and don\u2019t ask your mom for advice on things like this anymore lol", "NTA and I absolutely second this - get in touch with your landlord ASAP. If they can harass you, I wouldn\u2019t put it past them to try and convince the landlord to lease the flat to them instead (behind your back).", "But, but V has achieved this most coveted social milestone. Isn\u2019t the entire world supposed to open up to her now??? /s", "Exactly this! Talk to your landlord and get an agreement signed now.", "Our names are both on the lease, but my roommate has already sent in writing that she wouldn\u2019t be resigning the lease when it\u2019s up. I\u2019ve already signed my own separate lease once our current one is up.", "Yes. So clearly NTA. OP, they are being bullied and your mom had poor judgement. That is YOUR apartment because you were there first.", "This right here!", "The apartment was newly renovated when I first moved in and central in the city, the landlord also doesn\u2019t charge an extreme amount in rent which is why I want this apartment so bad. Plus in the time I\u2019ve lived here he\u2019s only raised the rent once by only about  $20.", "Put this in writing to the landlord - don\u2019t just tell the landlord verbally.", "Yup. Entitled twats! So\u2019s the mom. Well maybe not entitled, but not on HER side. Wtf?!!", "I think if was up to the landlord he would rather me be living here. I always pay my rent on time while she has paid late a few times over the years.", "I was just talking to her about the situation over the phone when she gave me this input.", "Are people not supposed to ask their parents for advice once they\u2019re 18, now?", ">If both, who was there first?\n\nPost clearly says OP was", "Literally, the *only* y t a vote.\n\nGuess we found the roommate.", "Let me help you", "That\u2019s good news. I would still report to the landlord of the situation if it gets out of hand just in case.", "Definitely make sure the landlord knows you have no intention of leaving but that she is trying to reneg. You don\u2019t want her making bogus claims and trying to manipulate the landlord into not renewing you.", "I would just sign the new lease to start at the conclusion of the old lease. Then you have more eviction power over them. And you want have to worry about them going behind your back to try to get a lease.", "The there\u2019s your answer. The roommate has terminated the lease as of some date in the near future, after which you are sole lessor. You are perfectly within your rights to continue residing in the flat. \n\nFinally, you\u2019re an adult and do not need your mother to referee this dispute.\n\nNTA", "Make sure your landlord is aware this is the agreement to stick to and if anything changes to inform you immediately, if they\u2019re sending friends to harass you I don\u2019t doubt she\u2019ll try to do something sneaky there.", "Then this is already settled. She needs to find a new place. NTA", "Also, if you get any other future roommates, consider having them sign a sublease agreement spelling out exactly when they can terminate. You may need your landlord\u2019s permission for this, depending on what the master lease agreement says.", "I can't speak for your area but that pretty much leaves her hosed, I want to say in most cases. It's legally your unit.\n\nMy former tenant sent us a \"notice to vacate\". I'll spare you all the bat shit details but she tried to back out of it. We were able to get her to leave the unit 2 weeks later on her own. But she emailed us a few days later that we \"improperly evicted\" her and that she has a lawyer now and the cops will let her back in the unit \ud83d\ude44. We forwarded her the notice she sent us and told her to show that to her \"lawyer\" and that she left on her own accord with no court order. She came back with \"It's not worth to pursue\". \n\nGood luck on the next 4 months! I would avoid her as much as possible and block all their friends. Tell your mum if she cares so much about their wedding you're sure they're taking donations but their wedding is not your problem.\n\nNTA", "Couldn't agree more.", "Well, you have your answer.  Tell mom that unless she wants to pay your rent somewhere indefinitely so that your roommate can save for a wedding -- then she should drop it and be proud that you are protecting yourself, your financial stability and looking forward about rent increases.  You got 4 months left, maybe tell them if they want to leave early, then can...but you are staying and no matter how much harassment comes your way, that won't change.   Maybe start documenting any messages, etc., in case it gets uglier and make sure any valuables are safe.  Also, the landlord thing to make sure they don't pull anything snarky.", "You need to go back and talk to your landlord directly. Let them know that you want to have the property independently. Let them do the work for you. Get paperwork. You don\u2019t want your roommate moving in her fianc\u00e9 or whatever. You don\u2019t want them beating you and talking to the landlord before you to make that happen. If you do this now, she will have plenty of time to find a new place.", "This!  Immediately send a letter to your landlord stating that you ARE NOT moving out and intend to renew your lease when it ends.  And absolutely NTA!!!", "I wouldn't necessarily let the landlord decide but I would contact your landlord and say you as the current leaseholder are interested in renewing your lease. Your subletting roommate is trying to get you to leave but you would prefer to live there independently. You would like to renew your lease as the only occupant.", "It\u2019s their property I think it would be just to present the situation to them and let them decide. Look at it this way, if what you say is true it is likely the landlord will side with you anyway and it helps to legitimize your claim.", "Fair enough. Her opinion ought not to matter here, though.", "Right? I don't even have a relationship with my parents and I found that comment strange!", "It didn't read as asked-for advice, but maybe it was. OP, did you ask your mom for advice or were you just giving her the daily highlights?", "This. Sign the next lease now", "Be careful; by getting rid of both of you, the landlord can likely raise the rent.", "Yeah I mean I can see how it can be taken as \u201crunning to mommy\u201d or something like that but honestly if I were being harassed like OP and was wondering if I was right or wrong about something I\u2019d go and ask people I trust for advice. It doesn\u2019t seem weird for a parent to be one of those people and even the first talked to if it\u2019s a healthy relationship.", "If what op says is completely true, any landlord worth their salt would rather have a consistent tenant over some unknown entity.", "You\u2019re not wrong. I just think those folks can be far too rare in this world.", "I think you overestimate how many landlords out their are \"worth their salt\"", "If you live in a province where the rental governing body takes 6-8 months to evict someone you would also think very long and hard before you let someone in your property.", "Well I live in America so that's not really a problem here for landlords"]}
