Roommate wants something and has demanded it in a really entitled way.  She, her fiancee, and their friends sound like nightmares.\n\nYour mother's attitude is a bit disappointing though.  Perhaps you could suggest that if saving for roomie's wedding is the priority, rather than you moving out, your mother could just make a financial contribution to the wedding fund?", "NTA. These are all \"them\" problems. If they are harassing you and cursing at you, the friendship is likely over. And why would you do a favor for someone who is not your friend?", "NTA.

Sorry, but mom has it backwards on that one.\n\nV and fiance sound entitled. Just because they got engaged does not mean that the world is gonna come together and put them at some secret, super-special treatment, priority list.\nLife is still gonna happen on life's terms.\nThey need to cultivate that and not by force or manipulation, bullying, guilt tripping, yelling etc.", "NTA\n\nYour mom sure is though.\n\n You lived there first so really I think you have first dibs if one roommate needs to leave. Moving is expensive. It isn't something that one does lightly.\n\nYour roommate sounds like a bully.

Pretty sure landlords can act as mediators for harassment against their tenants.", "NTA\n\nSo their solution to \u201ccan\u2019t find a place we can afford on 2 incomes\u201d is for you to have to find a place you can afford on a single income guaranteed to be significantly more expensive than the current plan of you being the single renter? Cute.", "Definitely NTA.", "NTA.\n\nIt doesn't even matter whether this new roommate's name is on the lease or not. LL/T law varies a lot by state but it's probably the case that neither of you have any ability to force the other to move. \n\nEach of you is free to stay or leave unless you are evicted. Your decision to stay or leave might might affect hers and vice versa (e.g., if you say you are definitely staying she can decide whether to stay or leave in light of that), but nobody can compel anyone.\n\nDon't try to tell her what to do. Just tell her what you are going to do.\n\nProtect yourself and your property and be prepared for whatever you think might realistically happen. If she does anything that crosses a line that you think might constitute unlawful conduct you should contact a lawyer immediately, and if she does anything you think is criminal (especially anything violent or destructive) you should be mentally prepared to call the police. You don't want to wait too long to do that if it becomes necessary.", "NTA \n\nThis energy that single people should suffer for couples to benefit is some serious bullshit.", "NTA.", "You should contact the landlord and tell him you want to go ahead and renew the lease now and be done with it.

They need to save for their wedding as if that is a need-to-have and not a nice-to-have.. you have zero to do with any of that.", "NTA and her comment doesn't make sense except for her and her fiance. The two of them, with their combined income, are more likely to be able to afford the more expensive places out there than you would be by yourself.", "NTA.  At all.  Why on earth should you support them?  Moving will cost you a ton of money and stress.  Tell them all to F off with that nonsense.  Tell your landlord you aren\u2019t moving in case she tries to do something shady.", "I would get something in WRITING with the landlord that you intend to say and renew the lease.

They were fine moving out until they realized the cost so now they want to shift the cost over to you. \n\nI'm appalled that your own mother supports this.", "Absolutely NTA. You had the apartment first. You made plans and clearly communicated them. They can ask, you can say no. They\u2019re being rude and entitled and they can stay mad.", " INFO: whose name is in the lease as lessee? \n\nDo the other roommates have a sublease agreement with the lessor?", "NTA. 100% not. Your roommate can ask which she did but she then needs to accept the answer and most definitely crossed the line when she started cussing you out and getting others to harass you. \nI\u2019m also concerned you Mum thinks people she doesn\u2019t know deserve your home more than you do?!?  She\u2019s also a bit of an arsehole.", "Why on earth would you move out if you don't want to? They can find a place just as easily as you could and you've already made your plans to live there alone. I can't see a single angle for argument here. NTA", "NTA! Anyone, to include your mother, who thinks you should give up your apartment, that you\u2019ve lived in for 4 years, and before her, can take up a collection for your roommate and her fianc\u00e9s new place and then proceed to shove it up their ass. WTF is wrong with the entitlement of people today. Rhetorical question!", "This is one of the most clear cut ones I've read in a while, OP. I didn't even have to think about this for a second your NTA. Why should you have to move out and  pay more on a single income? You already had an agreement in place, they are all literally just bullying you now in hopes you'll cave, getting their friends involved is evidence of this. They don't give a damn about you and don't care if you can't afford to live elsewhere. Don't fall for it OP. Unless they start threatening you, making your life a living hell etc. Dont give your home for them.", "NTA but since youre still living w them for a few more months, please be very careful.", "NTA.  So basically she wants you to be the one to have to find a new place instead of her because other places are too expensive.  It makes no sense for her to say that you should be the one to find a new place.  Plus, why can't they live together in fianc\u00e9's current place?", "NTA. It\u2019s fine to ask it\u2019s fucked up to not accept being told no.", "NTA your mom sounds like she wants to take them", "NTA  be careful that the landlord will not sign with them behind your back so do something now!
