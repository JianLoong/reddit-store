My dads girlfriend treated me well at the start but gradually just got worse and worse. At one point we weren\u2019t even speaking to each other while we were living together (which was one of the times I felt \u201chappy\u201d living with her) but my dad forced me to talk to her. I recently moved out due to the high tension between me and her and unreasonable expectations that my dad\u2019s girlfriend placed on me. Since I moved out I haven\u2019t been in contact at all with my dad\u2019s girlfriend and I removed her as a follower on Instagram, but I\u2019m still in contact with my dad. \nMy dad called me the other day after work and essentially said he wants me to mend the relationship between me and his girlfriend. He suggested we go to dinner just the three of us and asked how I felt about it. I responded honestly saying that I\u2019m not thrilled about that and when he asked why I said that it\u2019s not something that I want at the moment based off of how she treated me when I lived with them. My dad got quiet and said that he didn\u2019t realize there was still so much resentment on my side and that he still just didn\u2019t understand why I wouldn\u2019t just talk to her. She hasn\u2019t made any efforts to reach out or anything and I have no desire to speak to her. My dad also said I should just let her follow me on Instagram because he has to hear about it all the time and I \u201cdon\u2019t even post anyways\u201d.\nI don\u2019t want to have any contact with her and I don\u2019t want to give in to her demands.

Your dad is thinking about himself primarily. He wants you to fix your relationship with his partner so *his* life will be easier. You should do what you feel is best for yourself.", "Tell him that. Tell him his relationship with his girl friend is his business but you are not dating her, she is not your mother nor is she a parental figure nor is she your friend. She is simply his girl friend and while that is HIS business you have made it VERY clear that you do not wish to have her in your life. Enumerate out the reasons - very clearly - why you do not like her. All of the reasons. \n\nAs for the social media - tell him no. She is not your friend. She is not family. She would absolutely not be in your life if it was not for him foisting her on you and you do not wish to have her on your social media. It is rude of him to demand it simply for his own convenience.\n\nYou are 18. If this woman is in his life for the long haul you are going to need to figure out how to find peace with her but at this stage take whatever time and space you need to regroup.", "NTA. At all. \n\nYour father is meddling where he is not called to solve a problem that is not his by using an authority he does not have. Your Instagram is yours and so is your time. Maybe your father's gf is a great person and your respective outlooks on life are simply different\u2026 In any case, you have the right to choose who you relate to and if she wants to get close, she should behave like an adult and be the one to talk to you. Damn, I can't believe that you are the youngest of the three and that the one who is behaving like a capricious child who can't understand the complexity of human relationships is your father.", "NTA - You are free to choose with who you talk to for whatever reason.

BUT\u2026 For the sake of your dad, who I assume you love, it might be worth trying again. The dynamics of the relationship would be easier to manage as you are not living together. It is surprising how much just getting some space can help a relationship.", "You literally gave no info as to why you\u2019re fighting\u2026\u2026Maybe the problem is you , maybe it\u2019s her\u2026.. with no information given how can people make a decision??", "NTA. Your dad has chosen his side. Don't feel bad. His gf and her problems are not your issues. I'd be lowering a bit of contact with my dad until we could have a relationship without him trying to insert her into it.", "NTA. You have every right to not want her in your life. She's not your mother. You're not the one dating her. His relationship with her should be kept between them and not drilled down your throat at the cost of your mental health. You're 18, and therefore, you have the right to decide who you want to have in your life and who can eat sh!t. He should respect your decision not to want to be around her. He has no right to force you to be around someone who makes you feel unsafe. \n\nOn a different note, I will never understand these 40-50 year old spouses who hate their partner's teen/young adult children for no reason at all. I understand every family situation is different, and I can't cast judgement down on everybody, but sh!t like that gives off the impression that once kids reach a certain age, or even before then if they're unlucky enough, their parent's girlfriends/boyfriends or spouses who did not help bring them into this world will start to feel jealous and ultimately threatened by them, which is really immature for somebody twice as old as they are, and unfair to kids, especially when their parents are stupid enough not to take them seriously.\n\nLife is already hard enough for our generation. Why do people twice our age need to make it worse for people in a less stable place than them? \n\nYour Dad's girlfriend needs to back the f*** off and leave you alone. Nobody has a right to behave in a toxic manner towards you and then demand to be in your life. Your Dad obviously fails to understand this.", "I cannot see how or why it should be YOUR job to fix anything here. Your dad's girlfriend didn't want you in her home, and now she's whining that she can't surf your Instagram. She's older, she should get a grip. \n\nYou're NTA, and your dad needs to tell girlfriend to calm down and find her own friends. You're entitled to a relationship with your father without her.", "Info: What did she do that caused the tension when you were living with her and your dad?", "Nta- I made it clear to my father when he cheated and split with my mom that I wanted nothing to do with his future relationships. I was 18. \nNow 28, and he is remarried and I have gone to exactly one dinner with her (not willingly. Father just brought her without asking), and I don\u2019t want to spend time with her. \nWe are very low contact now, but I\u2019m okay with this. He helps my younger brother and that is all that matters to me.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
