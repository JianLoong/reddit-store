So I\u2019ve known both him and his dad for 14 years. My bf was my first love. We were middle school sweethearts. We went our separate ways for several years but always remained friends. Then got back together almost 2 years ago. This was the first time I\u2019ve ever been alone with his dad though. His dad has some major drug issues. My bf and his dad have had a very rough relationship for as long as I\u2019ve known them. When I met my bf at the age of 14 he was homeless living in a friends storage unit. His dad was always on drugs and his mom was a hooker. My family and I have always loved him regardless though. He is an amazing person. He had a very hard upbringing but he worked really hard! and now owns his own dental company. His dad was hit on a motorcycle a couple years ago and almost didn\u2019t make it. He went through many surgeries. And is still blind in one eye and can\u2019t really get around. His dad now owns a multimillion dollar house on the beach because the person who hit him happened to crazy rich!", "I\u2019m definitely going to tell him in person tomorrow. I\u2019m trying to decide if I should first tell him what his dad said or if I should ask something along the lines of \u201cdo you wish we were more sexually adventurous than we are now\u201d?

I wasn\u2019t really sure which sub to put this one in \ud83d\ude02 Thank you!", "Dad sounds like a grifter loser you should def say something and if your bf has issues with you over it lose him", "So his dad\u2019s conversation was 100% inappropriate. I would tell your bf and make sure to set major boundaries with his dad. Let him know that its not okay to discuss your sex life and you will cut contact with him if he doesn\u2019t respect you. \n\nThat being said, with the history if drug use (even if he no longer uses) combined with the potentially major brain trauma that comes with a motorcycle accident like that he could legitimately think the conversation was okay and not be mentally able to realize on his own that it wasn\u2019t okay to have that conversation. Which is part why I\u2019d suggest setting very clear boundaries with him.", "Ohhhh this changes things a bit.\n\nWhen your boyfriend's dad got in the motorcycle accident, did he have a traumatic brain injury? Because that could be the reason why he asked you such inappropriate questions. TBIs are things you don't really get over, and they can change someone's entire personality. They also affect impulse control, make it really difficult to filter thoughts, and can wreak havoc on the ability to mentally process cause and effect. While I agree with you that the questions were wildly inappropriate, and you should definitely tell your boyfriend they happened, the possibility of a TBI makes this a potential medical issue for dad. There's a difference between \"he's being a creepy perv because he wants to be one, and we can yell at him and fight about it\" and \"he got in a severe motorcycle accident a few years ago and nearly died, and now he said something really inappropriate and sexual to me, which was out of character for him. We should ask his doctor to evaluate him for a possible traumatic brain injury and see if there's anything that can be done medically to prevent this from happening again.\"", "I would make it clear from the outset that this is serious, you\u2019re not playing games. If you start trying to gauge his reaction to a supposedly innocent question then be prepared for an unpleasant encounter.\nI would be straight up with it \u201ci know that this is going to sound odd but have you been talking about our sex life with your Dad?\u201d \n\nDon\u2019t let him answer because you will catch him off guard and his natural reaction will be to not get in trouble. If you have to, speak over him and say what happened", "Yeah he is, I wanted to give his dad a chance because I\u2019ve heard he\u2019s doing better, but I won\u2019t ever be around him alone again after this", "That is true! His dad is very mentally and physically unstable and has a lot of health issues.", "Ok I\u2019ll say it just like that! I\u2019ll update you guys with the reactions for sure!", "I would say, say something before he turns it around on you. If he suspects you were not receptive to his \u201cadvice\u201d, he might turn the story around to your bf to save face. People do that all the time"]}
