When my family expressed concern and disapproval she went even further to admit to that she \u201ckept it discreet for the first couple months\u201d. Meaning she was probably seeing the other man as early as 4 months after my brother\u2019s passing. \n\nMy parents are incensed, but I think they went a bit overboard. They seem to think my SIL should wait until her child is grown to date again which seems ridiculous to me. When they said this to SIL I did voice my disagreement with that, and told them that was a ridiculous expectation. But also told SIL it still seems too soon to be moving on and that this is hard news for all of us. It just feels disrespectful to my brother when he\u2019s barely cold and in the ground. \n\nShe left and is ignoring my texts.

I'm sorry that's ridiculous lol. She will still be apart of her child's life,but not necessarily your's or your parent's. She has custody of her child,not you.You just gotta hope her new interest is willing to take her knowing she has baggage.\n\nAlso I don't think your brother would want her to be stuck on him after death because technically he'd be holding her back.

They basically have the wiring down for this sort of thing. And that this process can be parallel to grief, not interfering. It's counter intuitive, but it makes sense.\n\nKey takeaway is that people process things at their own speed and while an overlap would be suspicious, she doesn't owe you a specific yet arbitrary grace period that has to take your or your parent's feelings into account.", "NAH. I see your side, but I also know everyone grieves differently. Some people can\u2019t be alone with their own thoughts.

You did right by standing up for her that it's ridiculous to wait until child is fully grown, and I can even understand you feeling it might be disrespectful to your brother - but grief affects everyone differently, and this might be a good thing for all involved so you shouldn't judge her for her reaction to grief(hence the vote). You commented the new partner also lost a partner, so they may be helping each other to keep functioning, which is what's needed for the kid.", "Yta it's 'until death do we part' and death, sadly parted them.

I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if she was in a relationship with him while Ben was still in the picture even tho that may be taking it too far I just can\u2019t fathom starting a relationship so quickly although everyone is different ofc.

It isn\u2019t a matter of actively going out looking for someone to \u201cdate\u201d - it\u2019s just finding common ground with someone you know, and words of comfort and understanding turning to words of interest, affection, and possibly romance.\n\nA close friend is in a wonderfully happy second marriage - after her husband died somebody we knew through work whose wife had recently died started chatting with her more than usual - they were able to forge a wonderful second marriage for themselves because they truly understood the pain of the loss they had each suffered.\n\nI\u2019m very sorry about the loss of your brother.", "NTA.

You probably haven\u2019t lost a spouse. Not even people that have lost a spouse can tell you exactly when, if ever, is the right time to date again. Every person is different. This is no longer the Victorian era with social rules dictating a grieving period. (Which even in the Victorian era it wasn\u2019t uncommon for someone to remarry while still in the proper mourning period, which lasted years, because society recognized it was necessary. A widow or widower often needed a spouse to maintain their household financially or physically.)", "YTA, and it sounds like more so your parents. This was all dismissive of your SIL's grief and circumstances, even though it is otherwise reasonable to be uncomfortable with the new dynamic.

And terribly selfish. Her grief is not yours to determine. You won't ever get over the loss but the relationship wasn't the same. Likely, she will never get over it,  either, but had to deal with some harsh realities pretty quick... and her emotional support person is gone. You and your parents have each other to lean on. You should check your behavior before you lose contact with your niece.", "ESH, I'm sure this will be unpopular. It's not your families business if and when she dates. You shouldn't have said anything. I do think it's too soon to date, but she isn't us. We don't know what she's thinking or going through.

If it was sudden, 4 months seems a bit hasty, but men tend hook up very,very soon after death of spouse, so maybe we need to quit the double standard. \n\nIf husband dies after long illness, then she\u2019s been grieving his death for as long as he\u2019s been sick.", "She\u2019s not telling her daughter yet and made it clear that we are not to tell the daughter. I\u2019m not too worried about abuse because the guy is a friend from childhood that her and my brother both were friends with. He lost his wife to cancer 2 years ago and it sounds like he offered her support as someone who understands her kind of loss, but it seems he had ulterior romantic motives too.", "It isn\u2019t some \u201crandom\u201d guy, she has known him for a long time\u2026 maybe read the actual post before commenting.", "Sudden, he was in an accident and died 5 days later.", "Op stating it is disrespecting her brother is too far. Plus it doesn\u2019t sound like op said anything supportive. \u201cLike it seems too soon but if you are happy and think you are ready then I support you\u201d", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

They knew each other, and both dealt with a tragic loss of their spouse, chances are they bonded over that and feelings just naturally developed.\n\nThat's a lot more understandable than OP's SIL going onto dating sites and trying to pursue a relationship, in my opinion.", "That would be hard for me. I definitely believe people should continue living, and hopefully find love again. Absolutely, I would want my husband to have love in his life, although it\u2019s painful to think of. But damn, I would be fucking devastated to lose my sister, I don\u2019t know how I would get out of bed. I have a beautiful son to live for, but my sister has been my best friend, literally since the dawn of my memory. It would be really hard for her loss to be so fresh, and to see someone who loved her so much \u201creplace\u201d her. It would be hard not to see it as that, and where else do you point your anger when you experience loss like that? I feel for SIL, too, but it\u2019s too bad she couldn\u2019t contain that information for a while longer.", "They can have all the feelings they want, vut their actions should be respectful.", "Thank you.\n\nUnless something super inflammatory was said, I gotta go with NAH. You and your family are well within your rights to be uncomfortable with this new dynamic and voiced that opinion but I don't think that makes you guys assholes. On the other hand, she seems to be moving on to something too quickly (IMO), but she seems to be understanding the potential discomfort with both your family and her daughter and took steps to avoid unnecessary conflict. It sounds like everybody is trying their best in an unfortunate situation and I am sorry for everyone's loss.", "That changes nothing. \n\nSorry but you and your parents are definitely the assholes here.", "I thought they had nephew together. Do they have a niece together too? So it's 2 children? SIL can do what she wants with her life, but tread carefully so you don't lose access to the children. The children will need a safe space in case she and her new bf try to force him to be new dad or try to erase your brother. Talk to SIL about how this could affect the kids without going nuclear. But establish a good relationship with the children so they can talk about their dad freely with you guys.", "Again, I am sorry. I do think we all move within grief differently. She's doing the best she knows how to do. I'm trying to think how I would feel, being suddenly widowed with a young child. I cannot in good conscience judge her. Please, consider a note apologizing for your reaction and offering support. I'm sure she feels very alone.", "The reason I think that might be at least a factor in their thinking is that they said wait until the child leaves home. \n\nI am sure you are absolutley correct that they are also very upset about how quickly she moved on from their son. I\u2019ve said it before. Our daughter was killed. The pain is almost unbearable. His parents are suffering so much. They can not be even thinking correctly yet. Your mind is in a constant state of confusion & forgetfulness. Especially when it\u2019s an accident like this.", "As someone who has lost a child, I hope you all realize how little you understand about what your parents are going through.\n\nA random woman who lost a child to a miscarriage sent me a book that had helped her. It\u2019s called \u201cRoses In December: Comfort for the Grieving Heart\u201d and the author is  Marilyn Willett Heavlin.  She lost 3 sons at 3 different times. When I read it, I kept thinking that\u2019s how I feel. I had my parents & siblings, SIL read it. Several of them apologized afterwards for things they\u2019d said & done completely out of ignorance, while thinking they were helping. I have since sent that book to many parents when they lost their child. All of them called me to say it helped them so much - they had the same thoughts I did. This is how I feel. This is what is happening to me.\n\nPlease get that book for your parents. If even your mom and you read it, it will be helpful. Maybe your SIL would be willing to read it.\n\nThey sound like they will make a good couple then. May you all extend grace and love to each other. Blessings to you all.", "Yes, I did miss that part. It still seems like a random guy to the grieving parents.", "I can understand why you and your family are having a hard reaction to your SIL moving on so fast in that case. \n\nI think you all could certainly handle it better when it comes to dealing with her, even you, despite your attempts to play the middle. Everyone grieves in their own way and there is no set \"time\" after the death of a partner to move on. It's ultimately her choice. \n\nBut I can understand the difficult feelings you are all processing with it. I think a lot of people here aren't being honest with themselves if they think they wouldn't have similar thoughts if their SIL started dating a few months after a sudden death.", "I'm very sorry to read that, OP. I hope you and your family will find ways to feel peace during this transitional time.", ">the fact that it's someone she already knew, makes it less strange to me that she started a relationship after four months.\n\nMy uncle lost his wife and two kids in a car accident. Six months later, he started dating one of their friends. They got married, had four kids, and are still going strong 45 years later.", "My thoughts exactly, after reading the new BF was a widower himself", "Someone she knows who has also lost a spouse so whatever connection they had was probably made stronger through their grieving. \n\nOP You don't get to control how long someone grieves or moves on. It's okay to not be ready and it's okay to move forward everyone has a different pace. You can have negative feelings about it but you have to recognize those feelings are your own and for you to deal with. You're thinking of it as her trying to replace your brother when you can stop and realize she's trying to move forward with her life. \n\nI hope everything works out for her, she deserves happiness. YTA", "Well said.", "They have one child, my 7 year old niece. She made it very clear we are not to tell my niece about this man as it\u2019s too soon for her to process this kind of news.", "Maybe, but anger seems an odd reaction if it\u2019s a safety concern.\n\nI get it, but it\u2019s ridiculous to expect the SIL to wear widows weeds and mourn her husband for 15 years. \n \n\nShe\u2019s under no obligation to make her child available, time to make nice.", "Irrelevant who the guy is to the parents, they need to keep their opinions to themselves when it doesn\u2019t involve them. What the SIL decides to do in her personal life only concern herself and her child when the time comes.", "Wow, what unfathomable loss and unexpected joy to follow it. Happy for your uncle to have known so much love, bittersweet for it to have come from loss.", "Is... Is Joe Biden your uncle?", "Yeah, even if they were just friends then his being there to support her during such an unbearable loss would absolutely make sense to me as to why they ended up seeing each other after such a period of time.\n\n...But he's also a widower?! If anything, I'd just be glad that my SIL in that situation had someone in her life that knew what she was going through and was able to support her. The fact she also happened to find love with that person? All the better!", "[removed]", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).
