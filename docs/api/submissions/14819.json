He was married to Veronica (34f) for 8 years and together for 3 years prior to being married. They have one child together who is only 7. \n\nMy SIL recently admitted she is seeing another man. When my family expressed concern and disapproval she went even further to admit to that she \u201ckept it discreet for the first couple months\u201d. Meaning she was probably seeing the other man as early as 4 months after my brother\u2019s passing. \n\nMy parents are incensed, but I think they went a bit overboard. They seem to think my SIL should wait until her child is grown to date again which seems ridiculous to me. When they said this to SIL I did voice my disagreement with that, and told them that was a ridiculous expectation. But also told SIL it still seems too soon to be moving on and that this is hard news for all of us. It just feels disrespectful to my brother when he\u2019s barely cold and in the ground. \n\nShe left and is ignoring my texts.

I'm sorry that's ridiculous lol. She will still be apart of her child's life,but not necessarily your's or your parent's. She has custody of her child,not you.You just gotta hope her new interest is willing to take her knowing she has baggage.\n\nAlso I don't think your brother would want her to be stuck on him after death because technically he'd be holding her back.

They basically have the wiring down for this sort of thing. And that this process can be parallel to grief, not interfering. It's counter intuitive, but it makes sense.\n\nKey takeaway is that people process things at their own speed and while an overlap would be suspicious, she doesn't owe you a specific yet arbitrary grace period that has to take your or your parent's feelings into account.", "NAH. I see your side, but I also know everyone grieves differently. Some people can\u2019t be alone with their own thoughts.

You did right by standing up for her that it's ridiculous to wait until child is fully grown, and I can even understand you feeling it might be disrespectful to your brother - but grief affects everyone differently, and this might be a good thing for all involved so you shouldn't judge her for her reaction to grief(hence the vote). You commented the new partner also lost a partner, so they may be helping each other to keep functioning, which is what's needed for the kid.", "Yta it's 'until death do we part' and death, sadly parted them.

I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if she was in a relationship with him while Ben was still in the picture even tho that may be taking it too far I just can\u2019t fathom starting a relationship so quickly although everyone is different ofc.

It isn\u2019t a matter of actively going out looking for someone to \u201cdate\u201d - it\u2019s just finding common ground with someone you know, and words of comfort and understanding turning to words of interest, affection, and possibly romance.\n\nA close friend is in a wonderfully happy second marriage - after her husband died somebody we knew through work whose wife had recently died started chatting with her more than usual - they were able to forge a wonderful second marriage for themselves because they truly understood the pain of the loss they had each suffered.\n\nI\u2019m very sorry about the loss of your brother.", "NTA.

You probably haven\u2019t lost a spouse. Not even people that have lost a spouse can tell you exactly when, if ever, is the right time to date again. Every person is different. This is no longer the Victorian era with social rules dictating a grieving period. (Which even in the Victorian era it wasn\u2019t uncommon for someone to remarry while still in the proper mourning period, which lasted years, because society recognized it was necessary. A widow or widower often needed a spouse to maintain their household financially or physically.)", "YTA, and it sounds like more so your parents. This was all dismissive of your SIL's grief and circumstances, even though it is otherwise reasonable to be uncomfortable with the new dynamic.

And terribly selfish. Her grief is not yours to determine. You won't ever get over the loss but the relationship wasn't the same. Likely, she will never get over it,  either, but had to deal with some harsh realities pretty quick... and her emotional support person is gone. You and your parents have each other to lean on. You should check your behavior before you lose contact with your niece.", "ESH, I'm sure this will be unpopular. It's not your families business if and when she dates. You shouldn't have said anything. I do think it's too soon to date, but she isn't us. We don't know what she's thinking or going through.

I am sorry for his death and your loss, but don\u2019t impede her return to well-being. Be happy for her.", "YTA. It's not like she was out on the prowl for men.  This is an understandable way to handle grief. The fact that the guy is also a recent widow makes it more understandable. \n\nSupport your SIL or mind your business.", "Soft YTA. Sorry for your loss, but she doesn\u2019t owe you any explanations.", "from reading your edit it sounds like they\u2019ve found comfort with each other given their shared experience. i\u2019ve never lost a partner but i can imagine it\u2019s horrific especially when they\u2019re so young and having the support and care of someone that understands that grief would be incredibly helpful. the relationship is new, maybe it\u2019ll be long term, maybe it won\u2019t but you and your parents don\u2019t get to judge or dictate how she chooses to live her life. \n\neveryone grieves differently YTA", "Trauma reactions vary from person to person. Your sil has lost a huge part of her life. I think consciously or subconsciously shes trying to repair it.", "YTA\n\nI\u2019m sorry for your loss. Please consider that grief is different for everyone. Seeing your SIL try to move on quickly may be very painful for your family. That doesn\u2019t make it necessarily wrong. She needs to be allowed to make her own decisions.", "YTA.\n\nThis poor woman isn\u2019t a shrine to your brother, and you don\u2019t get to tell her when she\u2019s allowed to move on or how.\n\nIsn\u2019t there enough misery in the world without insisting that people you\u2019re supposed to care about wallow in it?", "YTA. Not your marriage, not your business. \n\nIt's not unusual for people in happy marriages to look for - and find - love again after being widowed. It's also not unusual for the people around them to judge their grief and new love harshly. \n\nIf you and your parents would like to maintain contact with your nibling, you would be wise to show kindness and compassion to the child's mother.", "My uncle married his wife 7 months after the death of my aunt. The were happily married for 38 yrs before his death. Who are we to judge people\u2019s grief timelines.", "Plus who knows the state of the marriage before the brother died. Maybe they were heading to divorce or had an open marriage. It sounds like the SIL has been nothing but respectful to her late husband's family but they are acting like she should be shrouded in a veil of black until death. The way they're heading, they're going to lose contact with that granddaughter.", "Well since he was friends of the brother\u2026 I doubt he was not there\u2026 \n\nBut boy oh boy \u2026 it\u2019s clear that enough people are affected by this. And people clearly care only about themselves", "My grandfather was alive 10 years after my grandma died solely because he met a woman at the casino who was also recently widowed. Otherwise he would have drank himself to death, and was trying to do just that. They were together until he passed. They met 3 months after my grandma died.", "I agree, everyone is grieving and it doesn\u2019t seem like anyone was unkind just expressing opinions and expectations that don\u2019t need to be met.  More than likely the shock of finding out will fade and everyone will become more accepting."]}
