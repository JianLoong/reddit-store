I joined the club in my freshman year and I\u2019m arguably the one who contributes the most. I\u2019m the first to suggest new ideas, I know the most about CS amongst the members (around 50), and I\u2019ve led lots of successful events. Last year I was elected to become VP, and I wanted to become President last semester.\r\n\r\nThe issue is that despite me clearly being the most qualified, I ran into issues with the outgoing President. She said I was bad with delegation and that I also tend to be authoritarian in my leadership style. I honestly don\u2019t really dispute any of these, because I know I feel very passionately about doing something the way I want, and if I must behave in an authoritarian way to get good end results\u2014so be it.\r\n\r\nI ended up losing President and was re-elected to VP. Turns out the outgoing President talked shit about me during deliberations and turned people against me who previously could only see the result of my work. Two other candidates became co-presidents instead, and they\u2019re far less qualified and have barely done anything.\r\n\r\nOutside of this club, I\u2019m also an RA for a college dorm, and my director really likes me because my work and dedication carries over to my RA position too. He gave me an offer to return as an RA next year but for a nice, newly built dorm that\u2019s incredibly competitive to get into. Many people in the club want to live there, so I came up with an idea: Our college allows students to create living communities in the dorms for people with shared interests to live together. My director was hesitant about doing it in the new dorm, but I managed to convince him on my track record. When students choose their dorms for next year, they can apply to become part of the community (with max 30 people). Usually, my director would read applications and interview, but he trusted my judgement and left that to me.\r\n\r\nThis is the part where I might be TA. I presented this to the club, and I emphasized that I couldn\u2019t make any guarantees, but I would be the one largely reviewing the applications. Around 40 people from the club excitedly applied and so did the two co-presidents. I sent a contract to the applicants, and one of the terms was that if they\u2019re selected, joining the community also meant voting for me as President next year (the contract was essentially the ballot).\r\n\r\nI said my director wanted this assurance so that he could be confident that he didn\u2019t need to coordinate with anyone but me. He didn\u2019t really say this, and I just did it so I could be guaranteed the presidency. Nobody except the co-presidents and a few other VPs objected, and I said that nobody was forcing them to join the community if they didn\u2019t want. I ended up accepting most of the people who applied from the club (ensuring I would get a majority vote for the presidency) and I rejected the co-presidents and VPs because I didn\u2019t want to create any power struggles next year.
