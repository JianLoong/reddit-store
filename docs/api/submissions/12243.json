Middle school is a time when kids are merciless to each other. It is also a time when children want to fit in and when they start to exert control over those things that their parents used to do for them.\n\nYour wife is not helping your daughter exert agency and make choices.  Her dismissal of your daughter's concerns and wishes are bound to create resentment and will result in a massive blow-up when your daughter is older. Worse yet, it almost guarantees that she will reject all things related to her ancestral culture because she'll associate that culture with conflict on all sides.\n\nDiscuss compromises such as keeping the home foods for after-school snacks. But even more importantly, encourage your wife to listen to your daughter's concerns and to take her wishes seriously.", "NTA. Culture is important, but so is your child's comfort, health, and happiness. It sounds like you tried to do everything you could to rectify the situation before resorting to this. If your daughter was so distraught that she wouldn't even eat her lunch, than this is probably for the best\n\nSide note: if your wife cares that much about your daughter valuing her culture, she probably shouldn't force her to enge with it in a way that causes her so much distress. That sounds like a pretty good way to teach her to resent it", "NTA...kids are absolute jerks and anything strange is always fertile ground for jokes and ridicule.  We can wish all we want that contacting the principal will solve the issue but it usually only makes things worse.  We could hope that kids might open their eyes to new things instead of making fun, but it doesn't usually go that way.  Your wife is TA for not making Lily anything different.  Celebrating culture is great...but you can do that at home.", "NTA\n\nYour wife is making this about forcing her culture on a tween who frankly is not a full part of that culture. \n\nSo she sees this rejection as to lunch as a rejection of her and her culture. \n\nIt\u2019s not about any of that, it\u2019s about a girl who is getting made fun of. Yes, it\u2019s dumb bullying. But it is real easy to say be strong and don\u2019t care, when you aren\u2019t a tween.\n\nIt\u2019s shitty to go behind your wife\u2019s back, but it seems your wife has made a unilateral decision and has made this a hill to die on at the expense of your daughter. So I get it to some degree", "NAH. Middle school is hard.  Lily is reacting to a real situation. Your wife wants her daughter to be proud of her culture.  You remember your childhood days, and want things easier for your child.  Don\u2019t go behind your wife\u2019s back, but tell your wife about your childhood memories.  Also, Lily should get a say in what she eats.  Can she make her own lunch..", "NTA\n\nLet's call a spade a spade here. Your daughter is being bullied for her lunches at school by her peers, and at home by your wife.\n\nIt's absolutely terrible your daughter is being subjected to racist bullying at school- but the solution isn't yelling at her and forcing her to be subject to more racist bullying at school. That is more likely to make her resent her Indian heritage than to be proud of it. \n\nUntil Lily is in an environment where she feels safe bringing her cultural food, let her bring safe lunches to school and teach her a love of Indian cuisine and her culture at home.", "NAH \n\nAt her age, I think the compromise should be that she be allowed to make her own lunch. That way, no one is going behind anyones back, she\u2019s eating her food, and she\u2019s responsible entirely for what goes in it. \n\nYour wife means well, but your daughter is old enough to decide what she wants to eat, and why. Pushing it on her will not make her feel more at ease, it\u2019ll just get her to dig her heels in deeper.", "NTA. \n\nYour wife wants to assert her dominance at the misery of your daughter. \n\nThere\u2019s nothing in the culture rulebook that says you must eat every meal according to your own culture. And judging by the ignorant bullying of lily\u2019s peers, you\u2019re not living in India. Your wife should first embrace the culture she\u2019s immigrated to, a culture she\u2019s chosen to raise her daughter in, if she wants other people to embrace hers. Being Indian is only 1/3 of your daughter\u2019s culture. She\u2019s also 1/3 Chinese and 1/3 the culture of where you\u2019re currently living.\n\nA very big part of parenting is coming to accept you can\u2019t try to control your kids and sometimes you don\u2019t know best. Sometimes your kids know what they need better than you. You\u2019ve figured this out but your wife hasn\u2019t, and she\u2019s the one who needs a wake up call.", "NTA\n\nWhile your wife has a point that lily shouldn't feel shamed about her culture, that's a wonderfully adult view on how life should be.\n\nChildren are not adults, those who are different are singled out. Children find their tribe and then set anyone else up as other than them.\n\nThe school will clearly do nothing about it so I totally agree with what you did.\n\nAlso, your wife's attitude of well she just needs to learn to not be insulted by other kids sucks. Again, it's so easy to say but the reality is that it's not easy to just ignore being bullied.", "NTA\n\nLily is not of 1 culture...she is Chinese, she is Indian and she is American. As much as your wife want her culture prioritised, she is not listening to Lily and what she wants. \n\nTaking food she will eat is so important...kids learn better with full stomachs. \n\nYou tried Sarah's way....you spoke to the school etc etc but the truth is, Lily is the one who is suffering. Sarah's refusal to put Lily first is the issue. \n\nYou tried to make everyone happy...you didnt waste the food as you ate it  Lily was happy and eating.", "NTA - Lily is not being denied \"her\" culture, since she obviously eats Indian food at home. Lily is growing up in a multicultural society, is multi ethnic herself, and it's not inherently wrong that she would like to fit in with her peers at lunch by eating a sandwich sometimes. Forcing her to eat Indian food for every school lunch is controlling, and it seems that Sarah is projecting her own wants, desires, and trauma onto her daughter in being so restrictive here.", "NTA\n\nClearly the wife would've changed it if she wanted to.. But it also seems that she doesn't seem to care whether or not lilly is getting bullied for the food she brings. \n\nYou're trying to help your daughter and you're doing it well, your wife is forcing her cultural food onto your child who's specifically asked to bring basic foods at least for a little bit. \n\nI genuinely don't get why your wife refuses to do it.. Especially since it has absolutely nothing to do with her.", "NTA. Middle schoolers don't respond to logic, or wishy washy conversations between admins and parents. Meanwhile, your daughter is miserable. I think it's awesome you are helping her.\n\nWhen I was that age, I'd hide in the bathroom or wherever to eat, and eventually I would just throw my food away because I felt ashamed. Later, I developed an eating disorder because of the negative associations around eating. \n\nYou need to get this sorted before it becomes serious. \n\nYes, your daughter should be proud of her heritage, but let her be proud on her own terms. There's enough fights in life that she should get to pick what she wants to fight. Your wife, right now, is picking for her.", "I'm probably going to get downvoted to hell, but YTA for *doing it behind your wife's back*. It sounds like your attitude toward your daughter is *fantastic*, but this is something that you need to work out with your wife away from your daughter.", " NTA - school kids can suck, helping your daughter feel comfortable around her peers isnt a bad thing and when shes older and more confident in herself she may change her mind about what she takes. She's also old enough to have some input into making her own lunches so perhaps thats an option, empowering her to do it for herself so mum doesnt feel put out and she still feels comfortable with her food choices.", "Nta. You\u2019re instinctually protecting her from being harassed and obscured in society. If anything, the fact kids are making fun of her is the issue. I will say though that given the fact you did exchange it from something more traditional to a different culture, would a child pick up on you not defending certain principles later on in life? Maybe. Your wife is right though, however seemingly harsh. Racism and prejudice exists within your country. Your daughter needs exposure to it, in order to learn how to protect herself from it. I would consider talking to the teacher about monitoring the situation and bullying. They can approach the students independently and properly reprimand them. \nYour daughter may not currently understand the situation but one day she will. There are other means to go about before resorting to assuming another culture.", "YTA \u201cbehind my wife\u2019s back\u201d lying wasn\u2019t the way to do it. Should\u2019ve told her the truth.", "YTA. I think you actually made the right move in trying to help your daughter fit in, where you went wrong was not discussing this with your wife. My mom is sri Lankan and would pack us kids leftover curry and rice, and such for our lunches. We got picked on for having the \"weird food\" too. We talked about it with mom, and she agreed to give us good old fashioned white washed American lunches until we got to hs and decided other kids opinions were stupid. You really need to discuss this more openly with your wife, and your concerns about Lilly being able to fit in at school.", "ESH. \n\nYou for going behind your wife's back. Your wife for making unilateral decisions. Lily's classmates for starting this. Even Lily a little bit for going behind mom's back with you and making extra work for her parents. \n\nYou all need to really talk and come to a compromise. If this is something you feel that strongly about you need to stand firm against your wife's decision. \n\nPart of the reason your wife may be standing firm is the extra work & cost involved. You're making 5 extra meals a week at this point AND treating the ones she spent time making poorly (is anyone eating them? I hope it's not just  getting tossed...).\n\nMaybe a good compromise is to have Lily make her own lunches. Sandwiches and Mac&Cheese are absolutely something a middle schooler can make themselves. Then mom has one less responsibility and her hard work isn't going to waste.", "NTA Your wife is the cause of your daughter's bullying and she doesn't care.", "Soft YTA. Not for making the lunches \u2014 while Lily should be able to eat whatever she wants without getting bullied, and its great to support her bringing cultural food for lunch, it\u2019s also your daughter\u2019s battle and it should be up to her to decide how much she can handle / what she wants to eat.\n\nThe soft YTA is for making her lunches in secret. You wanted to avoid a confrontation with your wife, so you cut her out of a parenting decision and put your daughter in the middle. If you think the right choice is offering your daughter options, you need to tell your wife that, and have this discussion out.", "YTA. Your heart is in the right place, however this is the kind of marital disagreement that should be solved with communication and compromise. Tell your wife you feel very strongly about this, and you are entitled to an equal say in what your daughter gets for lunch (as long as you are willing to do the prep, which clearly you are). If your wife absolutely refuses to budge, you can still send Lily with food you have prepared and let her decide what to eat. Either way, being deceitful to your wife about it was not the right route, and doesn't set a good example for your daughter. \n\nAlso, it seems like that school needs to be pushed to do more. It's 2023, if a kid is being harassed due to their ethnicity they absolutely 100% have to put a stop to it, immediately, no ifs ands or buts.", "There are a couple of parts to this\n\nThis is so tough. And I'm sorry you're dealing with it. Being parents who are from different cultures than most others, is really difficult. \n\nBut...still.\n\nThere are a number of parts to this. The first part is where you encouraged your daughter to enter into a conspiracy to lie to her mother. Now, when she's fifteen and switches conspirators from you to her chump of a boyfriend, and the issue is sneaking out at night and not school lunches, you'll rue this day. \n\nDo you think encouraging your daughter to deceive her mom was more likely to help or hurt their closeness?\n\nAnother part, you used short term thinking in an attempt to solve a long term problem. The lie was bound to found out. And now here we are. \n\nWhich brings me to...\n\nYour wife is your partner. In life and in this adventure (sometimes hellscape) that is parenting. She needs to be able to trust you have her back, just like you need to be able to trust she has yours. The two of you wold benefit from taking steps to get on the same page. So that you can move as a united front. It will make your daughter feel safer, and it will make your wife trust and respect you more. \n\nThe final piece?\n\nI think your wife is right. \"I know how brutal middle schoolers can be, and I didn't want Lily to feel insecure or upset even \" Worst reasons in the world for lying to your wife. Well one of them, anyway. Welcome to the next eight years. Its going to be all about being upset and insecure. You cannot smooth out all of life's problems from her path. Your daughter needs to learn how to face these things.  \n\nYou have not, in fact tried everything else. There are any number of choices that could still be made. When I was a little girl and kids were making fun of my hair (I'm black). My mom cornrowed my hair into beautifully intricate designs that made them wish their hair could do what mine could. \n\nSome version of that might be the answer here. That is to *lean in* to her culture. Present it as a gift, an opportunity to see more of this world we live in, rather than something that your daughter has to make her classmates endure. An option might be to work with the school to arrange a field trip to an Indian restaurant. Or to arrange for an Indian meal at the school for those who wish to partake. Along with, or instead, someone could (with your daughter's assistance) do a presentation on the history of different dishes. \n\nIndia has such rich, beautiful tradition and history in connection with it's food. Stand with her through this difficult season, but help her to show her pride in both of her cultures. And give others the opportunity to appreciate them as well", "Yta for not only lying to your wife but also making her the \u201cbad guy\u201d in your daughter\u2019s eyes.", "YTA for conspiring against your wife and indirectly teaching your kid to feel ashamed of her background.\n\nI would suggest maybe the three of you use a weekend to make food from your individual cultures together. Make a real day of it with, like a mini-feast and include Lily in the food prep whilst also teaching her the background of some of your favourite dishes.\n\nInstead of making her feel othered and isolated from her own multicultural background and give into lunchbox shame, teach her to feel empowered that the food you make for her has a history, has a power and a love behind it. Tell her stories about your own relationship with your parents and the food they made for you. Maybe if she sees the effort that goes into making it, and makes it herself, she will feel a little more in-control of her relationship to it? Try also lunch notes, things to make Lily feel less alone and more secure when she is by herself at school.\n\nBut replacing her food is just teaching her to kowtow to bullies and how to code-switch at an early stage.", "NTA", "NTA but the school is.

Middle schoolers are brutal and watching your child struggle is awful. You did the kind thing and saved Lily some deep distress. Should the kids parents know better? Should the kids? Sure. Is it okay that her mother is frustrated? Yeah. But honestly, pick your battles. When high school rolls around I bet she\u2019ll be wanting her Moms food again.", "NAH.  You sound like two loving parents trying to make the best decisions on how to support your daughter, you just have different solutions to the problem.  Maybe there is a way to compromise.  At the end of the day, you want Lily to eat at school so that she can focus on her studies and doesn't get moody from low blood sugar.  The three of you should have a talk together and brainstorm some solutions.  11 year olds are very capable of coming up with good solutions - maybe you can find something that is culturally appropriate and healthy but also easy to eat and not triggering for her. \n\n An important thing to remember about teasing is that it is never about the food, it is always about kids with inner pain finding a target that they can hit - if they see her as weak they will find something else to tease her about even if she comes to school with boring, low nutrition white foods.", "Your wife is 100% TA\n\nLetting your child be bullied is wrong. Give that child a damn sandwich. Enjoy your cultural food at home. Children are mean. There's absolutely no reason to force the issue on this. It's only hurting your child. Mommy dearest isn't the one dealing with her peers ostracizing her. And I'm sorry, but Indian food is very fragrant. It's going to get noticed. \n\nTell your wife to just stop. This has nothing to do with her. All she's going to do is end up with a child who resents or hates her for putting her through hell.\n\nKeep being a good dad. Pack her lunches.

You both have valid points and want what's best for Lily but are not on the same page as to what that is; however, I agree more with your side.\n\nYou're not the AH for wanting your daughter to have an easier time fitting in, especially now that she's in middle school and a lot of the kids can be AH's; it's a parent's instinct to protect their children and your concerns are legitimate - middle school can be brutal, and it's not good for Lily to not eat lunch.  You are the AH for going behind Sara's back which doesn't set a good example for Lily, but your intentions were good.\n\nSara's not the AH for not wanting Lily to be ashamed of her culture.  Sara's intentions are also good, but her unwillingness to compromise and see things from Lily's perspective make her the AH, as well as ignoring Lily's pleas to not contact the school about the issue.\n\nAt this stage in Lily's life & school career, I think the best thing is to do whatever you can (within reason) to make school less miserable for her; middle school sucks enough without making lunchtime an unpleasant ordeal. It's stressful enough just finding kids to sit with.  She is still being exposed to the cuisine of her culture at home so it's not like she's refusing to have anything to do with Indian food.\n\nMaybe lunch can be a combination of whatever is \"normal\" for middle schoolers nowadays plus some Indian food that's less...I hate to say 'noticeable', but the spices can be very pungent, especially to those not familiar, so something more bland perhaps, or an Indian dessert, if Sara is unwilling to budge.  Maybe Lily can buy lunch at school a couple times a week.  Compromise is key.\n\nNote:  ESH does not include Lily.\n\nTL;DR - OP and mom both suck for being unable to come to an agreement on what's in Lily's best interest.

A few years into our teens  and she had the most generic lunches, her hair was dyed blonde and straightened, she used skin bleaching creme which fucked up her skin, did blend in with all accessoires and clothes even though she was clearly uncomfy in them and went by the most generic name back then, \"Sarah\". She was still subjected to racist bullying.\n\nI think your wife wants your daughter to learn how to deal with that kind of aggression because she'll most likely be subjected to it more or less all her life. Also she might realized the lunches are not the true root for the bullying and taking them away is only a short term relief until the bullies find another thing. And at least her lunches are external. If they bully her next for her hair or skin it's much more personal.\n\nBut at the same time it is completely understandable that you and your daughter want to get rid of the immediate cause of most bullying in hopes it will get better. If your daughter decides that her way of not being bullied is to be as \"unobtrusive\" as possible it's understandable and might work if the bullies attention shifts to someone else. A lot of others already pointed out how you're N T A so I won't elaborate but I also do not think your wife is an asshole. Talk about it. Let her explain in more depth.", "Lily is 11.

It takes strong emotional fortitude, or in my case, absolutely be numb to everything. I switched schools almost every year through elementary and middle, including switches from American to foreign schools. I was always the new kid and I'd often get picked on. I was always different. Not Indian enough for Indians, not American enough for Americans. By middle school, I was a loner but not an interesting target for bullies. That tactic also mainly works if you're new somewhere. If you're currently being bullied, I've experienced that not reacting causes them to escalate because they've seen a reaction before.", "Well, that's not how it works here either.

She\u2019s half Chinese. So if we are going to use the mom\u2019s same argument, she\u2019s denying Lily of her Chinese culture by not making her Chinese food to take for lunch every day. It\u2019s food. You don\u2019t have to eat Indian food every single day. And by skipping days, it doesn\u2019t make you less Indian. JFC. The mom sounds insufferable. I\u2019m also curious if they ever eat anything other than Indian food at home if she\u2019s taking indian for lunch every day.
