Would it have been nice if she have taken the time to text that she was running longer than expected, sure.

Your standard response to any guilt tripping from them when you say \"No\" and they push back is \"I am not going to unalive myself for YOU or anyone else. I said NO\". then, repeat \"Asked and answered already, NO\".\n\nWhy am I saying this? Because, Hon, I am \\*dying\\*. My prognosis is 4 years at best. Of course, I am just stubborn and onrey enough to live longer, because I made a promise to a 12 year old girl (who is now 30ish) that I would fight tooth and nail to stay alive for her.\n\nYou think about that for a moment. That baby is going to need you. So, now is the time to make a solemn vow of your own; to fight tooth and nail to stay \\*ALIVE\\* as long as you can for your child, for as long as they need you. Which isn't going to end when they are 18. Goodness, I still need my mama, and she has passed. \n\nSo, anything, anyone, that cuts into what precious time you have on this earth and endangers you with stress, triggering a diabetic episode (I am sure this has been said to you by your doctors before), interferes with your ability to make it to term and deliver; I MEAN ANYTHING OR ANYONE, needs to be sent packing with brutal, ruthless efficiency.\n\nIn short, Dear One, you need to become the most selfish, self-centered person on this earth so that you SURVIVE to be this little one's mama and they survive, too.\n\nAnd your own Mother!

She's in a very high-risk pregnancy, which means she is OFF LIMITS for your shenanigans!\". (Why, yes, I have done similar for my own daughter. Sick as I am, I still willingly put myself between her and people who want to use her for her own agenda. Yes, she is perfectly capable of saying no and does, frequently. But, as I said, I am dying. Therefore, I am quite a bit more blunt about asking these people the following \"She said NO. Did you suddenly forget how to speak English? Do I need to show you the door now? Or have you suddenly developed a terminal case of severe rectal cranial inversion disease?\" I kid you not, I made my 80 something year old father snort his coffee through his nose once when I said that to his brother.

You needed that job more than he needed his wife hanging around, and you\u2019re not doing for favours for someone who\u2019s just shown you that your well-being isn\u2019t valuable to her.", "NTA. Your sister isn\u2019t entitled to your time regardless of the circumstances. \n\nIf you\u2019re in the U.S., you might want to contact an employment attorney. It sounds like your Type 1 diabetes is covered under the Americans With Disabilities Act. If so, it would probably have been illegal to fire you for getting sick.", "NTA", "NTA\n\n> that essentially I chose to stay and help her and miss the interview so it\u2019s my fault.\n\nYou agreed under the condition she\u2019d be back to pick up her child before your interview. \n\nEven in the event of an emergency, if you know a person is waiting for you to come back because they have something important to do (like a job interview, since jobs is how folks earn money to pay bills) and you don\u2019t, an apology is still proper etiquette.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m doing something good so it erases how shitty I was to you\u201d is a terrible approach to how to treat people. \n\nSupporting your partner shouldn\u2019t mean screwing someone else over. I\u2019m so glad you were able to reschedule your interview - but wow your sister could have really fucked this up for you.\n\nAnd to be frank her husband is a grown ass adult who wasn\u2019t incapacitated. It\u2019s certainly NICE to have company, but he could have handled the majority of time on his own. She could have even come back and watched her own child for a bit until you got back from your interview.", "NTA. I wouldn't want her around either and it would be the last favor I would do for her. I would be livid.", "I would love to know how a job fired you for being diabetic. That\u2019s super illegal where I\u2019m from.", "Easy NTA", "NTA...Your sister apparently doesn't know how to \"adult\". Like, she couldn't bring her kid with her if you weren't around?", "This comment needs to be hella further up this thread. Perfectly worded, perfectly compassionate, perfect in everyway. Please keep being stubborn and ornery for your reason, they are immensely lucky to have you.   \n\n\nOP is NTA and does need to slam those boundaries in place.", "You're incredible, and I want to be like you.", "Welcome to Reddit where a family member in an emergency is \u201ctossing their kid\u201d onto someone like they were using them\u2026", "NTA\n\nI hope you get the job. I hope rescheduling doesn\u2019t count against you. I also overextend for family sometimes.

So if she's so supportive of CHOICE belonging to the person making it--then you have chosen not to have your sister in your home.  \n\nStick with your decision and tell you mom she can spend it with Sis if she's got a problem.  You do what you have to do for your health\n\nand Good Luck with your rescheduled Interview.", "NTA. \n\nCongrats on the pregnancy! Dealing with insulin and hormones and cravings can be rough, so I wish you lots of luck!!!", "Oh FFS. NTA. Send sister and partner a box of Emetrol, Pepto Bismol, Imodium, and Zantac for Christmas. Good grief.", "NTA. We don't know how severe the stomach ache was. you should never ignore severe stomach pain. for all you know it could be appendicitis. I don't think they are assholes for that being the emergency. The least they could have done was apologize for not keeping you updated and for making you postpone the interview when they picked up the child.", "NTA. Although you did clearly put in that sob story stuff, the key is that she promised you wouldn't miss your interview and she made you miss it. She could've taking the kid to the hospital, and she asked you for a favor (not an emergency).", "NTA for being pissed but banning your sister is an overreaction IMO.  You could have said no.  YTA for banning your sister and NTA for being mad.", "NTA. I\u2019d have left the kid at the police station and texted her to go pick him up there.", "I'm leaning towards YTA.\nI understand it would have been a basic curtesy to message you and explain she couldn't return but you seem to have left out a lot of details regarding the trip to the hospital. No one just goes to the hospital just for a stomach ache. \nSomething tells me this emergency trip was far more  serious than you've let on. Without further details on what the medical emergency was I would lean towards medical emergencies trumps job interviews. Also, hospital trips aren't quick, when accepting to watch your sisters kid, you should have fully realised and accepted that it could take far longer than expected.", "take the kid to interview, of course.", "Yeah, why couldn\u2019t the child ride along to the hospital?", "Not recommended to take children to hospital right now with all the various viruses going around.", ">Saying what occurred in the scenario doesn\u2019t matter is not true in the least.\n\nIt is true. She did not down play the seriousness of the stomach ache by refusing to watch the kid even though she had an interview to worry about. She made a sacrifice in an emergency. \n\nExpecting an apology AFTER said \"emergency\" was confirmed not to be an emergency does not make you an AH. I personally think a text during (or as soon as possible after) would be appropriate, but I'm willing (and it seems like OP is willing) to let sis slide on that. There is no longer an emergency. There is no \"variety of stimuli\" and sis is still refusing to apologize for making OP miss her interview. That puts sis firmly in the AH category. Expecting an apology and limiting contact with someone who refuses to respect your time is a completely reasonable response. \n\n>I don\u2019t think anyone would disagree that maybe sister should have apologized, but without knowing how the situation was handled when she came to pick up the kid there may be a very good reason she didn\u2019t get a chance to.\n\nIt should have been the first thing out of her mouth or in a text as she was leaving the hospital. If she couldn't for whatever reason (e.g. OP flew into a fit of rage at pickup before sis could say anything), she had and has each following day. Every day she doubles down and refuses to apologize just confirms that OP should limit contact with sis, because sis does not respect her time.", "NTA There was no reason for her not to come get the child and leave him at the hospital for a little while. I wouldn't babysit for her again", "NTA\n\nThat wasn't an emergency.", "NTA. \n\nIf your sister could not have retrieved her child at the agreed upon time, it was her responsibility to find alternative care for the child. \n\nYour sister is an AH for not honoring her commitment to you and your mother is an AH for trying to make excuses for your sister.", "The firing was for time off while she was hospitalized.

She could have left him alone to pick up her child while they were waiting for results.", "I would be apologizing profusely and emphatically while walking in the door to pick up my child if I did this to someone, even more so to a sibling who is in a precarious situation of her own.
