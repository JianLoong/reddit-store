Surrogacy is done in certain ways for a reason, to maintain psychologically healthy distance for the carrier among them.

He is literally talking about using a single woman as both prostitute and surrogate . . . paying to use her body for his gratification in multiple ways. The parallels with trafficking and just the commodification of women's bodies in general is grotesque.\n\nMy point is, your \"friend\" has some serious pathology going on.

Leaving the friendship is safer, best for him and best for you. Onwards to people who don't make you feel insane."]}
