Surrogacy is done in certain ways for a reason, to maintain psychologically healthy distance for the carrier among them.

He is literally talking about using a single woman as both prostitute and surrogate . . . paying to use her body for his gratification in multiple ways. The parallels with trafficking and just the commodification of women's bodies in general is grotesque.\n\nMy point is, your \"friend\" has some serious pathology going on.

Or, he\u2019s got some serious psychopathy something, batshit", "NTA this dude is psychotic and a narcissistic like he says ur an asshole when u told him the truth and that\u2019s the good part cause why should a woman\u2019s life be ruined by that prick he\u2019s practically tryna claim her as his own breeding grounds with no ties. Like seriously this dude needs more than a psych ward to help him out u don\u2019t take rights from a woman on her body and also because he ain\u2019t marrying her. Whoever associates with him need to cut him off he\u2019s bad news!", "Which is he a bigger fan of: Jordan Peterson or Andrew Tate?", "Wow, sad you gave up a friendship based on what strangers on the internet told you to do. But, I guess if you're that flimsy, you'll likely befriend him in a week again.", "NTA.  It's one thing to want to gather a child through surrogacy, but it's another entirely to want to have intercourse with an attractive woman and take their child away from her, because at that point it would be THEIR child not just his. I'm glad you've decided to part ways because I'm getting a vibe like this guy only sees women as an object.", "Does he read too many erotic books on forced insemination or something.", "NTA, that's not how surrogacy works. Obviously some people choose to do this but typically you get matched with a registered surrogate and they are impregnated with your semen samples. This guy just asked every woman he knows to have sex with him? I hope nobody says yes", "Honestly OP, you should send him this thread if you feel like you can do so safely, anonymously. Maybe would help him to see how much of a delusional fuckwad he is.", "NTA - he has a breeding fetish. I somehow doubt he\u2019d take care of the kid after. Wonder if he already has kids that you aren\u2019t aware of \ud83e\udd14", "What he wants to do isn't even legal..he can't have sex with a woman, get her pregnant and expect her to just hand over the child and sign her rights away..I mean, I guess he could, but nobody is going to do that. Nobody. There is no money in the world that could convince a stable person to agree to such barbaric requests. This man sounds ill.", "Dude is creepy level 9999. Good you ended the friendship.", "Things like this are more common than anyone thinks.\n I had a nasty breakup and needed somewhere to stay, I was roughly the same age as OP and my \"friend\" the same age as hers. First, he wouldn't give me a key to the house, second, he gave me substances under the pretenses I thought it was something else, and third he offered to impregnate me and \"take care of me\" when he knew I didn't want kids, all as a way to trap me. This is 1000 percent a way for this guy to get a young woman under his thumb where she cannot leave.", "NTA\n\nI think delusional was actually pretty mild. \n\nSide note: Can we get this guy on a watchlist?", "NTA. \n\nSo your boy wants to have sex with a friend, impregnate her, and then steal her child with the expectation that there\u2019ll be \u201cno strings attached\u201d and that they\u2019ll be totally cool with it?\n\nVery weird dude.", "No. He is delisiounal. He doesn't want a baby mama nor a relationship. Yet he wants the women to act like they love him. Only want him and no one else. Yes he is quite insane. No wonder he doesn't have kids or is married. He would have asked you next. I think you bet him to the punch by dumping him as a friend. Goodbye and good ridance.", "He is litterally dehumanizing women. I hope no one gives this man a child", "EDIT from scrolling other comments, I just learned what NI means, and I think you should touch more on that in your post because holy shit, it puts an ENTIRELY different spin on this. This guy us terrifying and you need to get as far away from him as possible. (I still say that using the word \"delusional\" is problematic, as it is a valid psychological diagnosis and shouldn't be a slur, though. Not caring what you say about this guy, but just something for you to think about in your general vocabulary.)\n\nSo, calling him delusional is harsh. Name calling never helps. Also, using actual psychological issues as slurs is bad form. I agree that his demands are 100% inappropriate, but name calling never helps. Just tell him what he is asking is not appropriate to ask, that it is way too much and he is out of line. No need for name calling. I think you're smart to be ending the friendship, though.", "NTA, he's a total creep.\n\nBut, you seem to understand the acronym NI which seems a bit specific. So is this the first time his wierd creepiness has seeped out? I'm sure if you look closely there are several hundred red flags throughout your 'friendship'.\n\nYou also don't say how you know eachother. If that is creepy too, block him and move on. Fast.", "Most 23 year old women don't have friends with men approaching 40. OP could stand some more complimentary company.", "How does a blind man become a serial killer? I am never watching that movie. Just your describition makes me shiver", "god imagine being on his list of people he thinks are hot enough to ask and thinks would agree. my skin would crawl right off my body and continue to scuttle around for the next million fucking years.\n\nnone of the women he contacted are safe, hell, none of the women he ever shares air with are safe", "Yes! It\u2019s like he watched the show and was like hmm not a bad idea \ud83e\udd14", "I see your update, but I'm curious. What even gets you into such a friendship? Like, how did you *get* to the place where you interacted with him recreationally, or actually *felt bad* after this lunatic raves at you?", "Yeah I didn\u2019t know that. Never even have heard the term. But the fact he wants to do it naturally is incredibly fucking weird. Thats definitely not apart of the surrogate process and the mom would have full rights of the child unless she signed her rights away. Which if she was smart i would hope so much that she would realize what a dickless d bag he is.", "I agree that the NI is super creepy and he\u2019s being gross. Just because you get the ick about surrogacy though doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s creepy.", "As a 40yo all my friends are varying ages - have to say though mostly in a 8 year range (either side) for compatibility reasons. Just a note for OP it's normally easier to make bonds with people within this age range of you as they've grown up with the same things (to a degree) and are often in the same stages of life as you", "I can confirm, they have to have given birth previously, with little or no complications", "You know you just made realize something. Just as much a woman could go to a sperm bank. A man can go donate and get a sugroate for kids of his own. Plus he could adopt a kid. Or ask a prositute. I have heard of some be willing to do so for big money. He has to have big money though. At the same time I am glad he has no kids. He is too childish to probably raise a child.", "He doesn\u2019t want a surrogate he wants a ducking handmaid!", "It definitely sounds suspiciously like he wants to trap a woman into a situation where he has all the power over her children, so she\u2019ll have to do whatever he wants. Offering for the \u201csurrogate\u201d to stay with him is the first step to literally getting her in the door and becoming dependent on him (for housing). After having that first child and giving up her parental rights, she\u2019ll feel obligated to stay as she\u2019ll be powerless to leave with the child. This sounds like the plot of a horror movie.", "Yeah, this guy doesn't really want kids,because that's not what one would do to become a parent. He has a fetish and is involving everyone around himself in it. NTA, stay away from this guy and warn your friends.", "But then why would you want a woman with no other kids? Surely a woman with other kids would be less likely to claim yours.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNo, he just wants someone he owns and uses completely but has no emotional, physical or any responsibility towards", "Not sure about American Laws, fertility laws are wildly different everywhere, but another option with a known donor is to pay a Lawyer to draw up a parenting contract where the donor surrenders parental rights prior to if there is a child that happens.", "Yup. Adoption is human trafficking", "Oh god, was it on Netflix that had that show about the one sibling pod but it was because the doctor was using his own sperm and not the parents\u2019 or another donor?\n\nI watched it and I was so sickened by it.  I felt so awful for all of the donor kids.  Especially when they confronted him and he basically judged all of them like a fucking experiment based on their perceived success in life (as determined by him).", "There are WAY more than just that one guy. The stories that Laura are giving a platform to are horrifying.", "There are way more than just that one. Look for the podcast: insemiNATION", "Oh man.  Will mentally prepare, but I need a new podcast to listen to during my runs.  So thanks, will check it out"]}
