Surrogacy is done in certain ways for a reason, to maintain psychologically healthy distance for the carrier among them.

He is literally talking about using a single woman as both prostitute and surrogate . . . paying to use her body for his gratification in multiple ways. The parallels with trafficking and just the commodification of women's bodies in general is grotesque.\n\nMy point is, your \"friend\" has some serious pathology going on.

I had a friend that wanted to do the same thing but this was a woman. She kept having unprotected sex with tinder dates and lying about not being on birth control because she wanted a baby. It pretty much was everyone in my social circles breaking point and everyone cut her off.", "NTA. Please be careful & stay away from this man. He's dangerous.", "NTA, what he\u2019s describing is not a surrogacy situation. \u201cNaturally inseminating\u201d IE fucking a woman he finds attractive, a woman who can\u2019t have other kids mind you, that he then wants to take the child from. That\u2019s not how any surrogacy works full stop. He\u2019s just delusional and a freak.", "NTA. This friend should seek out some therapy, because none of this is normal.", "Yeah I didn't really get why you are friends with him while y'all are 13 years apart. He was in his 20s when you finished high school. But NTA and yes he is delusional.", "I wouldn\u2019t call him delusional or picky.          \nI will call him entitled, controlling, and possibly antisocial with misogyny.       \nDoesn\u2019t surprise me at all that every single one of his friends turned him down.        \nAs far \u201cdrama\u201d perhaps he needs to look within.", "NTA and run from this guy.", "Nah NTA, a good friend calls out friends on their bs when needed, and you did. He IS delusional and very obviously sexist. I hope he doesn't get to reproduce at all.", "Obviously some huge issues with his plan. HUGE! \n\nAnd here is one more issue: he pays the woman to be a surrogate, houses her during the pregnancy, and then goes to court so he gets 100% custody of the baby.\n\nGuess what happens next? The judge refuses termination of parental rights, and the sperm donor/creep asks for child support. \n\nConveniently, I think most women are smart enough to not sign up for this idiocy.", "NTA, glad to see you got away from that creep before he could do something to you. He doesn't want a kid, he has an impregnation fetish and a weird ego.", "NTA. The truth is he IS delusional. He wants to completely control a woman without giving her the security of commitment in return. That's insane. I'm glad to read you're ending the friendship and you're NTA for that too.", "NTA\n\nI think this friend heard about *The Handmaid's Tale* and thought it was a great idea", "NTA. Just block him, warn your friends what a creep he is, and move on.", "Glad to see your edit.  Because you are not his friend, you are his prey.  Block him on everything.", "What is NI?", "NTA. Dude wants his surrogate to not surrogate for anyone else OR have their own kids AND he wants to F them for insemination because he finds them attractive. \n\nThis isn\u2019t picky because the woman he asked is a person, not his personal breeding stock. Nothing harsh about that truth being told. He needs to get over himself and realize maybe THEY don\u2019t want any of that with HIM nor do they want to leave children in his care.", "YTA\n\nThis is one of those that scenarios reveal the gender bias of AITA. If a woman wants a child without the complications that come with of a boyfriend or husband, it\u2019s totally fine for her to go to a sperm bank and get AI. If a man wants a child without the complications of a wife and wants to find a surrogate he\u2019s a creepy weirdo who you should cut out of your life. WTF? How does that track?", "ESH. His requirements don't make much sense, but it sounds like he's at the beginning of this process and needs professional help with it. I thought most surrogates were already parents because it made the whole thing easier if they had had successful pregnancies and had no overwhelming desire for their own babies. It seems like the kind of arrangement he wants should be done through an agency or a lawyer with a contract in place. I don't think he's delusional, but I'm not gonna harp too much on using clinical words incorrectly as insults because I'm certain these comments will include plenty of that. He is wrong and sounds kind of ridiculous, but you were definitely way harsher than is necessary and doubled down on delusional when its not accurate. Basing this on your post, haven't looked at other follow-ups.", "This is what I was thinking too? Aren't those who choose to be surrogates already had to have given birth before?", "Gestational carriers are those who have no genetic relationship to the fetus. Surrogates are often also the one who provided the ovum. (Learned from Mama Dr. Jones.)", "Not only all of this but also the DEMAND that they never have any other children?? Like he owns them after surrogacy, dictating what they can and cannot do with their bodies and lives??? Insane.", "Not to mention that \u201cpaying her medical bills and housing her\u201d comes nowhere close to the typical price of surrogacy. You can expect that the pay for an egg donor plus surrogate is $150k ish. He\u2019s offering what.. 10k? Please talk to your friend because even if she wants to make some money, there are far better ways. And please spread word among your friends what a creep this guy is especially with regards to suggesting NI which is very rapey at best. I would avoid him like the plague", "This dude sounds very much like Ariel Castro types. Like keeping someone prisoner as a baby machine. Scary as hell.", "Women are not livestock. Your friend is sick.\n\n\nNTA", "This guy does sound very not right in the head. But if a man who went through all the correct steps and seemed to be sound of mind. Do you still think there is a problem with a man who would simply want to raise a child on his own?", "This, op. Read this again. And then again.", "Basically the guy sounds like he wants his own Handmaiden\u2019s Tale.", "Can you imagine someone with this thinking raising a child be themselves? I know it happens, but I definitely wouldn't be a part of encouraging it.", "If she agrees to be a surrogate, it's not \"her\" child.", ">bang without any of the responsibility of a relationship\n\nI'd be less upset with this creep if all he wants is casual sexual relationships with women.", "He has to find them attractive because NI apparently means natural insemination \ud83e\udd2e", "Yeah. He doesn\u2019t want \u201chis\u201d child to have any siblings so he rather they don\u2019t have any other children whether for themselves or others", "WTAF this is weird as hell tbh", "He specifically wants a woman to have sex with him get pregnant give him the child and give up rights. As well as not surrogate or be an egg donor for anyone else and also to not have kids of their own either before or after being his egg donor and surrogate", "Delusional is not strong enough.", "Yeah but he doesn't wanna hire someone who's already a surrogate. He's asking his FRIENDS to have sex with him and have his baby. Completely different from a sperm donor.", "My mom had me by donor insementation and went through a sperm bank to do so. Since it was an agency, it was an unknown donor and my mom signed papers saying she wouldn\u2019t track the man down for child support.", "It\u2019s not legally enforceable.

Air quotes are when you do it with your fingers.", "I was going with narcissistic", "I'm not that young myself . . . when the OP explained it in one of her comments I realised just what was going on here, and I thought, \"I'm old enough to be this girl's parent . . . if she was my kid, I'd be terrified if she were spending time around someone like this.\" I wanted to clarify for her, in case she wasn't seeing the bigger picture, just how dangerous this guy is. Terrifying.", "I\u2019m in my early 20s and I had no clue what NI means", "Natural Insemination... basically he wants to get her pregnant the original way", "I would block him. The amount of sheer... entitlement to women's bodies is gross. I am concerned for your safety because these kinds of \"friends\" can quickly go from seemingly stable and nice to \"I've been your friend for X years, you owe me\" stalker/r*pist etc. \n\nI can't begin to express how concerning it is that he thinks he can demand that a woman have sex with him, give him her only child, and never procreate again. Not only is he delusional, he's sexist and *dangerous.*  These are not the kind of people for whom \"consent\" (or lack thereof) is particularly meaningful.\n\nAs someone almost this guy's age, I beg you to block him and move on. No good can come from seeing him again.", "Now, you know.

DELUSIONAL", "NAL, but I\u2019d check with a doctor bc in most places in the US, it has to be done in front of a doctor/licensed professional even if it\u2019s done with a kit, or they can still legally pursue parental rights", "Sperm banks typically have legal cut out and protections and work to protect their clients. \n\nWhat this guy wants has none of those protections.", "Yeah, that's where my mind went, too (unfortunately), but I thought maybe I was crazy thinking that.... the more I think about it the worse it gets.", "He's a narcissist and he's fucking gaslighting you. Kick his ass to the curb!", "Church? Well, that explains a lot.

That's nothing against you at all. We just grew up very differently. Like, I remember what it was like without in home internet or cell phones and you likely don't.

They can be reimbursed for things but not paid for their time! I think it's the same in the UK, Australia, New Zealand, etc.", "I wish.
