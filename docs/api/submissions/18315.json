He doesn't have kids nor a significant other. He wants kids but he doesn't want a baby mother or that\"drama\" So he's been looking for a surrogate. He asked most his friends and they all said no. He asked one friend if she would and if she did he'll pay for her medical bills and she can stay with him but he doesn't want her to have any other kids or surrogate for anyone else. She said no. I told him that he's delusional to think someone would be his surrogate and not have children of their own or be a surrogate for anyone else. Now here's where I might be the asshole. He said to me he was picky not delusional. I told him he's delusional to think that any woman would want to be his surrogate with his ridiculous requests. Also with the edition of wanting to do NI because he finds them attractive. I told him he's weird and needs to get a grip on reality. He called me an asshole for not understanding him. Part of me feels like an asshole because I was kind of harsh but I don't know. Am I the asshole?\n\nEdit because some people find it confusing.

NTA", "I mean, technically you're very much N-T-A for all the obvious reasons.\n\nBut I'm very concerned for you, because you're 23 years old and hanging out with a man who isn't just delusional, he's got some deeply, pathologically misogynistic shit going on. He literally wants to pay a woman he finds personally attractive so he can breed her like an animal, and then permanently separate her from her child.\n\nThe term \"Natural Insemination\" is incredibly disingenuous. Surrogacy is done in certain ways for a reason, to maintain psychologically healthy distance for the carrier among them. Bringing sex into it, particularly for his personal gratification - \"because he finds them attractive\" - is incredibly dehumanising in a process that can already be inherently dehumanising to the woman involved. He is literally talking about using a single woman as both prostitute and surrogate . . . paying to use her body for his gratification in multiple ways. The parallels with trafficking and just the commodification of women's bodies in general is grotesque.\n\nMy point is, your \"friend\" has some serious pathology going on. He doesn't need a child of his own, he needs psychiatric treatment and not to be allowed near women or children. I would suggest that you distance yourself from him for your own safety.", "Nta. He's not just delusional. He's creepy af.", "NTA He\u2019s in some fantasy world he he wants everything to be the way he wants it. He wants certain women to do things he wants not what they want.

Everything he is being \u201cpicky\u201d about is basically a way of dehumanizing women.  Making sure they have no agency in his perfect little fantasy.
