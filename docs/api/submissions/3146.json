Her parents were young and weren't ready for kids so I raised her instead, for backstory.\n\nShe recently started working at McDonald's and actually gets pretty good checks from it. we've argued about how she spends her money a few times and the Air Pods were one of our biggest arguments. I told her they were a pointless purchase that she'd just end up losing. She got upset and said she just wanted to buy herself a new pair since someone stole her other pair.\n\nShe recently left her Air Pods in my car and a few days later I showed them to her, telling her i found brand new Air Pods and she instantly got upset saying that they were hers and asking why I never told her I found them. I told her she never said anything about losing them and that she was probably just lying about them being hers, however her name popped up when trying to connect them so I gave them back.\n\nShe told me that next time to either tell her anyways or just leave them where they are because she definitely knows where she had them last and the first place she'd check is the place that i took them from. i thought she was being ridiculous but I agreed.\n\nApparently she lost them again, because she came in last night asking if I'd seen the Air Pods themselves, not the case. I told her that her grandfather had found them and put them in a drawer but I didn't care to watch which one.\n\nShe instantly got upset with tears in her eyes slamming open my drawers asking where they were and I told her I didn't know and that she could wait for her grandfather to return. However this seemed to anger her and she told me that I wasn't supposed to let him do that since they were in her room on her bed and it made her think she seriously lost them.\n\nI told her she should be grateful that he even found them and didn't throw them away and she just shook her head and walked away. I followed her, telling her that her attitude and disrespect was unnecessary since I was only trying to help.\n\nHer and her sister both think I'm TA but my husband agrees with me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Although I don't see how I'm TA I will be nicer to my granddaughter about her airpods, and will respect that she doesn't want them moved. I'll be posting more on here since I'm thinking maybe my approach to parenting is wrong, or this generation needs a softer upbringing.

If she's making her own money, she gets to decide how to spend it as long as her purchases are safe and age appropriate, which Airpods are.

You don't mention how old she is but it sounds like she's a teen. \n\nShe got a job to earn money, she should be allowed to spend that money on things she wants.  When I got my first job my parents helped me setup a bank account and explained that if I put half of my earnings away in savings I could get a car when I turned 18 - this motivated me enough to start saving but I still had money to spend on whatever I wanted. If you think she's wasting her money put something's value in terms of the hours she worked for it, if she understands that it takes her 20 hours to earn airpods, and still wants them who are you to stop her from buying them? \n\nIt also sounds like she isn't doing a good job of keeping track of them, you should've returned them and had a honest conversation about it. Instead you hid them to try teach her a lesson. This will likely only drive you further apart, IMO you're better off working with her than against her.", "Yta , I don't know why you're being so passive aggressive and unnecessarily mean . But stop . Or when she's old enough she's not looking back .", "YTA. And all the additional comments you've made have solidified that with you doubling-down. Did you really come here for a verdict, or just to hear that you are right? Well, I'm adding to the pile of commenters telling you how wrong this approach is. It sounds like you can't let go of the fact that your granddaughter gets control over her own money and is making choices of how it's spent. She's 17, she has a job. You need to let that control go. If she loses the air pods, she'll experience the consequences of that. Your approach is disrespectful, difficult, and unkind, so I'm not surprised her attitude towards you is one that lacks kindness.   \n\n\nI said this in another comment to you, but I'll say it again here. She is not \"losing\" the air pods. She is misplacing them or forgetting where she put them. This is SO normal. Have you never forgotten where you left your keys? Phone? TV remote? There is a difference between losing something while out in public, and simply forgetting where they are in your home or car. I really hope you can take the feedback that this comment section has been giving you, apologize to her, and be kinder moving forward. Like y'know...\"hey sweetie, I found your air pods lying on your bed after you left with your dad's. I left them on your nightstand\" That kind of approach will allow her to more easily ask for help next time. Because that approach is helpful.", "YTA. It\u2019s her own money.

It's just ready for a PROPER upbringing.", "So much YTA! Not just YTA but a bully and cruel as well. You are not teaching her a damn thing about responsibility,  that's for sure. You do this for the sole purpose of driving home your opinion of how she should spend her money.

Her parents were young and weren't ready for kids so I raised her instead, for backstory. \n\nShe recently started working at McDonald's and actually gets pretty good checks from it. we've argued about how she spends her money a few times and the Air Pods were one of our biggest arguments. I told her they were a pointless purchase that she'd just end up losing. She got upset and said she just wanted to buy herself a new pair since someone stole her other pair. \n\nShe recently left her Air Pods in my car and a few days later I showed them to her, telling her i found brand new Air Pods and she instantly got upset saying that they were hers and asking why I never told her I found them. I told her she never said anything about losing them and that she was probably just lying about them being hers, however her name popped up when trying to connect them so I gave them back.\n\nShe told me that next time to either tell her anyways or just leave them where they are because she definitely knows where she had them last and the first place she'd check is the place that i took them from. i thought she was being ridiculous but I agreed.\n\nApparently she lost them again, because she came in last night asking if I'd seen the Air Pods themselves, not the case. I told her that her grandfather had found them and put them in a drawer but I didn't care to watch which one.\n\nShe instantly got upset with tears in her eyes slamming open my drawers asking where they were and I told her I didn't know and that she could wait for her grandfather to return. However this seemed to anger her and she told me that I wasn't supposed to let him do that since they were in her room on her bed and it made her think she seriously lost them.\n\nI told her she should be grateful that he even found them and didn't throw them away and she just shook her head and walked away. I followed her, telling her that her attitude and disrespect was unnecessary since I was only trying to help. \n\n Her and her sister both think I'm TA but my husband agrees with me.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "The thing is -- they are important to her. \n\nHaving your own money for the first time is EXACTLY for the things your parents would never (and fair enough) NOT buy for you, but that you covet bc some of your friends have them.\n\nIt's not about being softer it's about not judging choices that are different then yours and then copping an attitude about it. \n\nWe all learn lessons. How many ppl used to only buy expensive sunglasses but over time, have set themselves a more modest price limit bc of just how MANY fancy sunglasses you have lost (or broken.) As you get older I think you are more confident in your approaches and decisions in life but you got there through time and experience..... your daughter deserves the same privilege, bc her world and reality are not the same as what you went through.", "Just leave them where you see them!! My 2 teens always know where they put them but then my husband picks them up and moves them! Then they really are lost because he can\u2019t remember what he did with them!

Why are you arguing with your daughter over how she spends her money? If she wants to spend money on something she\u2019ll lose, let her. Also, why would you assume a pair of AirPods you found in your car were brand new and not hers? Also, if the AirPods were in her room on her bed, how were they lost? Also, how exactly did you help? It sounds like you deliberately withheld the AirPods from your daughter the first time and were entirely unhelpful in finding them the second time.\n\nTo be clear, she isn\u2019t innocent. You are right that she should take better care of her belongings if she doesn\u2019t want to lose them. Leaving things around in random locations like your car is not taking care of them. And although they were in her room on her bed, I don\u2019t see what\u2019s unreasonable about thinking this isn\u2019t a safe place for them and putting them in a drawer. What if, for example, a cat or dog ate them? The reasonable thing for your daughter to do would be to wait for her grandfather or call him to find the location.\n\nIt sounds like you\u2019re trying to teach her a lesson about buying the AirPods by deliberately going out of your way to hide them from her. This is passive-aggressive behavior. That means YTA.", "YTA. It's her money and if she wanted to buy AirPods, then she could buy AirPods.

What did your daughter actually do wrong here????", "YTA\n\nAnd a big one at that. Stop playing mind games. She\u2019s an individual, not your pet. Don\u2019t expect her to do everything as you wish. She needs to have freedom of choice especially when in comes to the money she earns. \n\nI can also see there\u2019s an even bigger issue here. Her acting all weird and lying and whatnot is just a sign she\u2019s got no trust in you. She knows how you are, a damn manipulative psycho. That\u2019s why she\u2019s like that, she probably can\u2019t even be honest and act like herself around you.\n\nIf you don\u2019t change, expect to be cut off from her life once she gets a family of her own.", "YTA - why are you moving her stuff and not telling her and letting her get upset.

Your (grand) daughter is a teenager, one who is old enough to get a job and purchased the AirPods with her own money. You seem to punishing her for existing because you don\u2019t like her mother. Stop moving your (grand) daughter\u2019s things and then saying she\u2019s losing them. You and your husband (?) are stealing her AirPods, hiding them and then blaming her for it. Also she\u2019s autistic, the AirPods are most likely something that helps her manage her stress. I\u2019m also autistic and if I was around people like you I would probably act the exact same way.

I mean, pretty sure you don't have the greatest examples of how to parent, because you turned out the way you did. But there are, like, actual studies and books and articles on it if you actually want to learn to do better. \n\nOr, you could continue on the path you're on and keep blaming these \"younger generations being selfish and irresponsible\" for your mistakes.

Why does your husband need to clear her bed of her things? \n\nStop taking her stuff!", "And why did you make a point of pretending not to know where he put them?", "Yeah, an adult shouldn't be touching a teenage girl's bed. It's just a breach of privacy now.", "I'm sure even with airpods, she can still afford books and a lap top. She keeps her working, the money keeps coming in....that is the point. It's also not up to you to decide how she spends her money....I don't even know how you get to tell her she is not \"allowed\" a car? She's 17, she can buy a car if she has the money and insurance.", "So\u2026you and your husband have been *punishing* her for choosing to buy Airpods? Call her liar? Hide them from her? Good grief. YTA.", "Good luck seeing her after she turns 18.", "With airpods she can listen do audio books and podcasts. \n\nJust because you don't understand something doesn't make it useless.", "Does she need those thing this current pay period? Bc if she doesn\u2019t you\u2019re overreacting.", "So she has a job but you don\u2019t let her get a car so that she has reliable transportation to and from that job?", "So you mean she\u2019s selfish because she bought something fun for herself rather than easing your finances/buying something you as a guardian are responsible for. Wow. WOW.", "That just means you disagree how she spend her money, but thats not selfishness\n\nShe can listen to books with them, listening is equal to reading\n\nYTA", "So, should someone come into your house and get rid of all the \"Pointless\" things in it? After all, you could have spent that money on better things.\n\nAnd seriously? She's 17. She's old enough to have a license, and she has a job. Why are you making her life pointlessly hard? You complain about her wasting her money, but putting her in a position where money is harder to earn. With a car, she could pick up more shifts, even get a better job. Then $200 wouldn't be such a big deal would it?\n\nPlus, a good pair of wireless headphones or ear buds are invaluable. Listening to music, podcasts, audiobooks, youtube documentaries, etc. is great for productivity and makes working much more bearable. And she'll have them for years instead of the cheap $40 ones that stop working in like 6 months.\n\nYou do know how making a good investment works, right? It's better to spend 200 dollars once in a 5-year period than $40-$60 every 6 months, right? You understand that that's less money over time? Because it really seems like you don't get that.", "So she's not allowed to put money in things she enjoys ?", "She earned the money, she can choose what she spends it on and doesn't need your approval on her purchases. You're annoyed she isn't doing what you want her to, and calling the wrong person selfish.", "So what you are saying is she's not allowed privacy either as your husband inspects her room? Why not put them in her draws and just tell her that he moved them instead of being petty. She's going to want and like different things to you your an entirely different generation most people now have wireless ear phones its her money", "You keep making this response, but it doesn't actually answer the question. What does her going to her dad's have to do with anything? Why is your husband going through and teenage girl's bed? Why not just put the airpods on top of her pillow or dresser?", "You keep saying that but what does that have to do with her AirPods", "Would you be happy if she started taking your shit and hiding it in random places? Would you thank her for doing that?", "Why are you so angry about her buying things that make her happy ?", "So why do you punish her for \"losing\" things? \"Losing\" being in quote marks because the second time she knew exactly where she left them, the problem is that you and your husband decided to play mind games with a *child* whose wellbeing you are responsible for.", "Christ,  if they were  on the bed, he could have  put them on her dresser or night table.\n\nFrom you post, it sounds like you don't even like her. ,you accused her of stealing them.", "Why do you think she should thank you? You didn\u2019t \u201cfind\u201d them for her. You hid them from her and played games with her. That is not helping. You didn\u2019t do something for her. You did something to her.", "Why would she thank you for finding them if your reaction to finding them was hiding her property and shaming her? And then telling her she should feel thankful when she is trying to tell you why she's upset is extremely invalidating. It seems like you had no intention on seeing it from her side and believe that your opinion should be law", "You didn\u2019t find them though? \n\nShe knew where they were, you took them and hid them. Twice. Wtf?", "Okay, so then tell her you'd appreciate a thank you if you find them for her.  That's still not selfishness, it's teenage egocentrism at worst.  She's not a bad person for misplacing her things.", "But you didn\u2019t find them while they were lost, you took  them from the place she left them and hid them, then played a dumbass game of not knowing who they belonged to or where they were. So they weren\u2019t actually lost until you took them. All this while knowing that she\u2019s autistic. She has nothing to be thankful for, you\u2019re purposely aggravating her.", "You didn't just find them, you intentionally played mind games and got passive-aggressive about it. Why would she thank you for that?\n\nIf you punched her in the face, would you expect her to thank you for that too?", "If she\u2019s selfish then you\u2019re an AH", "Thanking you for finding them in her own bed??? Do you go through her underwear drawers and \u201cfind\u201d her underwear too??? What is wrong with you?", "I found some power tools in the neighbors garage and there was no appreciation or thanks, they just came over here and disrespected me can you imagine that??", "Why should she thank you for moving and hiding her possessions?", "Funny thing about kids is they\u2019re people. Funny thing about people is they\u2019re all different.", "Maybe \u201cno one else minds\u201d maybe they give in to you. Careful not to break the will of this young woman. I ask you to consider this as a mother and grandmother myself. Our girls need will and spirit in the world or they grow up \u201cnot minding\u201d so much it will break your heart.", "You said in the post that her sister agrees that you were being an AH. So clearly she\u2019s not the only one who thinks it\u2019s an issue.", "That\u2019s not an excuse to bully her. She did nothing wrong. You did everything wrong. you\u2019re required to apologize and maybe buy her AirPods. you\u2019re also never allowed to go in her room when she\u2019s not there.", "At 17 she can buy what she wants with the money she\u2019s earned. If she loses them, then there\u2019s a lesson in that. If you and your husband keep messing with her stuff (including not returning her things when you have found them) she\u2019s going to learn that you are willing to be cruel to her when you disagree with her choices. YTA", "Why did her grandfather take them off her bed?", "That has to stop immediately.  If she's old enough to work, she's old enough to not have you looking at her account. End of story.", "You took away access to *her own bank account*? YTA", "Wow! So you stole her access to her own money?", "Are you insane? I mean seriously grab any parenting book from the last 50 years and you will see what you are doing is 1.) teaching her you can\u2019t be a trusted adult in her life 2.) that you are financially abusing you grand daughter. Does she work for that money? Do you work for the money she makes from her job? It isn\u2019t yours 3.) it isn\u2019t a generation that needs you to be \u201csoft\u201d it is a generation that is done with your generation thinking abuse is okay it will just make you harder/ that\u2019s how life is/etc. like anybody want to follow a generation that worked themselves to death, didn\u2019t enjoy there family, and is rude!!!", "All I get from that is:\n\nYou: *i don't like what you are spending YOUR OWN money on, so I'm going to take away your finances and make you ask to spend YOUR OWN money because I need some control over your life*\n\nDoes that sound about right?", "So basically you stole her money and holding it hostage?", "Wtf OP. Your decisions are actually so concerning that I'm genuinely worried about your health. \n\nHave you always done things like this?", "Wow this is just wrong \u2026", "All you're teaching your granddaughter is that you're an asshole who cannot be trusted. She will never come to you when she's in trouble, she will never ask you for help, and she will cut you off. And you will deserve it. You should write a parenting book about what not to do, and write down everything you've done to this poor girl", "She didn\u2019t even misplace them - she just left them where she was using them and was planning to use them again.\n\nSpecifically the ones on the bed.", "Take this award and upvote!\n\nI couldn\u2019t have said it better myself. And earbuds of any sort, whether AirPods or whatever brand someone chooses, are pretty much a necessity nowadays, especially with phones moving away from corded connections (unless you buy a specific dongle) to pure wireless. I\u2019m living with my mom who is in her 70\u2019s to help her out, and if I leave something like that laying around, she may move them to put them in a safer spot so I won\u2019t lose them, but she lets me know and tells me why. It\u2019s called courtesy and communication. These head games the grandma are playing are ridiculous and the granddaughter is so going to go NC once she\u2019s old enough to move out.\n\nGrandma/\u201cmom\u201d YTA 100%", "They\u2019re basically gaslighting their own child", "Being selfish means putting your own wants over someone else's needs. She was looking for the airpods because she needed to find them/use them...you answered her in a purposely and unnecessarily  vague way because you wanted to . She made a mistake losing them . You made a decision to respond pettily.

I wish I had an award to give. OP please listen to this comment", "Exactly! The girl asked her for help (where grandpa put the air pods) and she basically told her to fuck off", "For real", "What really gets to me is that OP is clearly resentful towards her granddaughter because she is so similar to her daughter. Ding ding ding! Looks like we found the common denominator here - OP and her crazy ways!", "Probably so she can successfully steal them this time.", "That\u2019s exactly it. It was plain as day when I read OP\u2019s post. \n\nOP did a shit job raising her children. And now she\u2019s bitter and pissed off because the child she\u2019s raising and is responsible for, used her hard earned money on herself, rather than towards the household. \n\nI feel awful for this girl.

You aren't listening. You are disrespecting her.", "As an apology she didn\u2019t do anything wrong she didn\u2019t lose them. It shows you understand. seriously you yelled at her for nothing????!
