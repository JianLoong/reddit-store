Her parents were young and weren't ready for kids so I raised her instead, for backstory.\n\nShe recently started working at McDonald's and actually gets pretty good checks from it. we've argued about how she spends her money a few times and the Air Pods were one of our biggest arguments. I told her they were a pointless purchase that she'd just end up losing. She got upset and said she just wanted to buy herself a new pair since someone stole her other pair.\n\nShe recently left her Air Pods in my car and a few days later I showed them to her, telling her i found brand new Air Pods and she instantly got upset saying that they were hers and asking why I never told her I found them. I told her she never said anything about losing them and that she was probably just lying about them being hers, however her name popped up when trying to connect them so I gave them back.\n\nShe told me that next time to either tell her anyways or just leave them where they are because she definitely knows where she had them last and the first place she'd check is the place that i took them from. i thought she was being ridiculous but I agreed.\n\nApparently she lost them again, because she came in last night asking if I'd seen the Air Pods themselves, not the case. I told her that her grandfather had found them and put them in a drawer but I didn't care to watch which one.\n\nShe instantly got upset with tears in her eyes slamming open my drawers asking where they were and I told her I didn't know and that she could wait for her grandfather to return. However this seemed to anger her and she told me that I wasn't supposed to let him do that since they were in her room on her bed and it made her think she seriously lost them.\n\nI told her she should be grateful that he even found them and didn't throw them away and she just shook her head and walked away. I followed her, telling her that her attitude and disrespect was unnecessary since I was only trying to help.\n\nHer and her sister both think I'm TA but my husband agrees with me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Although I don't see how I'm TA I will be nicer to my granddaughter about her airpods, and will respect that she doesn't want them moved. I'll be posting more on here since I'm thinking maybe my approach to parenting is wrong, or this generation needs a softer upbringing.

You don't mention how old she is but it sounds like she's a teen. \n\nShe got a job to earn money, she should be allowed to spend that money on things she wants.  When I got my first job my parents helped me setup a bank account and explained that if I put half of my earnings away in savings I could get a car when I turned 18 - this motivated me enough to start saving but I still had money to spend on whatever I wanted. If you think she's wasting her money put something's value in terms of the hours she worked for it, if she understands that it takes her 20 hours to earn airpods, and still wants them who are you to stop her from buying them? \n\nIt also sounds like she isn't doing a good job of keeping track of them, you should've returned them and had a honest conversation about it. Instead you hid them to try teach her a lesson. This will likely only drive you further apart, IMO you're better off working with her than against her.", "Yta , I don't know why you're being so passive aggressive and unnecessarily mean . But stop . Or when she's old enough she's not looking back .", "YTA. And all the additional comments you've made have solidified that with you doubling-down. Did you really come here for a verdict, or just to hear that you are right? Well, I'm adding to the pile of commenters telling you how wrong this approach is. It sounds like you can't let go of the fact that your granddaughter gets control over her own money and is making choices of how it's spent. She's 17, she has a job. You need to let that control go. If she loses the air pods, she'll experience the consequences of that. Your approach is disrespectful, difficult, and unkind, so I'm not surprised her attitude towards you is one that lacks kindness.   \n\n\nI said this in another comment to you, but I'll say it again here. She is not \"losing\" the air pods. She is misplacing them or forgetting where she put them. This is SO normal. Have you never forgotten where you left your keys? Phone? TV remote? There is a difference between losing something while out in public, and simply forgetting where they are in your home or car. I really hope you can take the feedback that this comment section has been giving you, apologize to her, and be kinder moving forward. Like y'know...\"hey sweetie, I found your air pods lying on your bed after you left with your dad's. I left them on your nightstand\" That kind of approach will allow her to more easily ask for help next time. Because that approach is helpful.", "YTA. It\u2019s her own money.

It's just ready for a PROPER upbringing.", "So much YTA! Not just YTA but a bully and cruel as well. You are not teaching her a damn thing about responsibility,  that's for sure. You do this for the sole purpose of driving home your opinion of how she should spend her money.

Her parents were young and weren't ready for kids so I raised her instead, for backstory. \n\nShe recently started working at McDonald's and actually gets pretty good checks from it. we've argued about how she spends her money a few times and the Air Pods were one of our biggest arguments. I told her they were a pointless purchase that she'd just end up losing. She got upset and said she just wanted to buy herself a new pair since someone stole her other pair. \n\nShe recently left her Air Pods in my car and a few days later I showed them to her, telling her i found brand new Air Pods and she instantly got upset saying that they were hers and asking why I never told her I found them. I told her she never said anything about losing them and that she was probably just lying about them being hers, however her name popped up when trying to connect them so I gave them back.\n\nShe told me that next time to either tell her anyways or just leave them where they are because she definitely knows where she had them last and the first place she'd check is the place that i took them from. i thought she was being ridiculous but I agreed.\n\nApparently she lost them again, because she came in last night asking if I'd seen the Air Pods themselves, not the case. I told her that her grandfather had found them and put them in a drawer but I didn't care to watch which one.\n\nShe instantly got upset with tears in her eyes slamming open my drawers asking where they were and I told her I didn't know and that she could wait for her grandfather to return. However this seemed to anger her and she told me that I wasn't supposed to let him do that since they were in her room on her bed and it made her think she seriously lost them.\n\nI told her she should be grateful that he even found them and didn't throw them away and she just shook her head and walked away. I followed her, telling her that her attitude and disrespect was unnecessary since I was only trying to help. \n\n Her and her sister both think I'm TA but my husband agrees with me.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "The thing is -- they are important to her. \n\nHaving your own money for the first time is EXACTLY for the things your parents would never (and fair enough) NOT buy for you, but that you covet bc some of your friends have them.\n\nIt's not about being softer it's about not judging choices that are different then yours and then copping an attitude about it. \n\nWe all learn lessons. How many ppl used to only buy expensive sunglasses but over time, have set themselves a more modest price limit bc of just how MANY fancy sunglasses you have lost (or broken.) As you get older I think you are more confident in your approaches and decisions in life but you got there through time and experience..... your daughter deserves the same privilege, bc her world and reality are not the same as what you went through.", "Just leave them where you see them!! My 2 teens always know where they put them but then my husband picks them up and moves them! Then they really are lost because he can\u2019t remember what he did with them!

Why are you arguing with your daughter over how she spends her money? If she wants to spend money on something she\u2019ll lose, let her. Also, why would you assume a pair of AirPods you found in your car were brand new and not hers? Also, if the AirPods were in her room on her bed, how were they lost? Also, how exactly did you help? It sounds like you deliberately withheld the AirPods from your daughter the first time and were entirely unhelpful in finding them the second time.\n\nTo be clear, she isn\u2019t innocent. You are right that she should take better care of her belongings if she doesn\u2019t want to lose them. Leaving things around in random locations like your car is not taking care of them. And although they were in her room on her bed, I don\u2019t see what\u2019s unreasonable about thinking this isn\u2019t a safe place for them and putting them in a drawer. What if, for example, a cat or dog ate them? The reasonable thing for your daughter to do would be to wait for her grandfather or call him to find the location.\n\nIt sounds like you\u2019re trying to teach her a lesson about buying the AirPods by deliberately going out of your way to hide them from her. This is passive-aggressive behavior. That means YTA.", "YTA. It's her money and if she wanted to buy AirPods, then she could buy AirPods.

What did your daughter actually do wrong here????", "YTA\n\nAnd a big one at that. Stop playing mind games. She\u2019s an individual, not your pet. Don\u2019t expect her to do everything as you wish. She needs to have freedom of choice especially when in comes to the money she earns. \n\nI can also see there\u2019s an even bigger issue here. Her acting all weird and lying and whatnot is just a sign she\u2019s got no trust in you. She knows how you are, a damn manipulative psycho. That\u2019s why she\u2019s like that, she probably can\u2019t even be honest and act like herself around you.\n\nIf you don\u2019t change, expect to be cut off from her life once she gets a family of her own.", "YTA - why are you moving her stuff and not telling her and letting her get upset.

Your (grand) daughter is a teenager, one who is old enough to get a job and purchased the AirPods with her own money. You seem to punishing her for existing because you don\u2019t like her mother. Stop moving your (grand) daughter\u2019s things and then saying she\u2019s losing them. You and your husband (?) are stealing her AirPods, hiding them and then blaming her for it. Also she\u2019s autistic, the AirPods are most likely something that helps her manage her stress. I\u2019m also autistic and if I was around people like you I would probably act the exact same way.

I mean, pretty sure you don't have the greatest examples of how to parent, because you turned out the way you did. But there are, like, actual studies and books and articles on it if you actually want to learn to do better. \n\nOr, you could continue on the path you're on and keep blaming these \"younger generations being selfish and irresponsible\" for your mistakes.

Don't tell me you didn't know they were hers since she sounds like she's the only one in your house that owns a pair.

He wanted our shoes kept by the front door on the floor mat, pretty easy to remember.  If they were in the living room, he'd give us time to move them but if we went to bed and they were still in the living room he'd hide them.

A GT Mini Mach One. For a 6 yr old a $350 bike may seem like a lot but he was riding that bike without any help in less than 30 min and had never had a bike before. Minis are designed for small kids and their light weight makes them easier for a kid to handle. Why did I mention that? Well I told him when we presented it to him that he is to never leave it anywhere because its so light and expensive (compare to the $69 walmart bikes) that many will steal it given the chance. So one day while riding over to aunt place I spot the bike in a yard a few streets over. I ride up grab it and take it to my aunts where we hide and wait for him to come home walking. Maybe people here dont agree with that method but I will tell you that he never lost that bike. When my own kids were old enough we borrowed it for a few years for them to use and when we my girls had grown out of it, we gave it back. Aunt still has the bike to this day. That bike is over 30 years old and in great shape still. Was a lesson taught? Who knows. But the bike was never left out again.  \n\n\nI dont have a problem with the concept of how you are trying to teach but my focus is not  on what you spend your money on. I would teach economics to  them and if they bought something small and they lose it, its on them. If its in an area where they will be easily lost behind something or between something or damaged I might move them, but will let them be. My kids had a deal where they had to buy anything under $200 entirely with their own money. I could, if I wished purchased it for them as gift or paid half or let them pay  the full amount. This usually went along with what the item was. More frivolous, more apt they are paying the full amount. Once you get over $200 I will go halfsies with them and this includes their first car. You can save $5000(or however much) I will match it. The idea was this was tied to my teachings on finance. This way they almost always had skin in the game and would care more for the things they owned. I get the air pods being seen as a wasteful purchase. Totally. Especially when there are generics that are cheaper and some comparables that can be had on amazing sales. She sounds young and like she is not getting much guidance from you about finances. This is a crucial age for her to be learning about how life is. What life costs. Its not cheap out there. I wouldnt change my methodology entirely, but remember everyone learns differently.
