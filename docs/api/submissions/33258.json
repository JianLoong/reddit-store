My wife was really close to her grandmother, so needless to say, the ring held significant sentimental value for her. Also, given that her grandmother died last year, it was a particularly painful blow.\r\n\nWe searched high and low but never found it. After it was missing for about a month and my wife started losing hope, I decided that I\u2019d have the ring replicated. We did have quite a few pictures of the ring, so I thought it could potentially be done. I did suggest the idea to my wife, but she did seem very receptive to it. She said things along the lines of how it couldn\u2019t be done and how it wouldn\u2019t be a replacement for the one her grandmother gave her. However, she didn\u2019t expressly say she would not allow me to replicate it.\r\n\nI ended up taking the pictures to a jeweler and described the piece to the best of my abilities. Two months and 9k later, the ring was ready. I will admit that I kept all of this secret from my wife, and the day it was ready, I cancelled work to pick it up and placed it between two sofa cushions that my wife usually sits around. I didn\u2019t want to present her with the ring, as I thought she wouldn\u2019t like that based on our conversation earlier. Fast forward a few days, and my wife \u201cfinds\u201d the ring. She\u2019s overjoyed, happier than I\u2019ve seen in a long time. I congratulated her on \u201cfinding it\u201d and thought that was that.\r\n\nRecently, my wife started questioning the ring. For the past few weeks, she\u2019s been telling me things like how it feels a bit different. Today, when I got back from work, my wife started asking me about the ring. She was saying things like how it felt different and how it looked different. I\u2019ll save you most of the details, but in summary, after about 5 minutes of grilling me, I confessed about having the ring replicated.\r\n\nTo say she was furious would be an understatement. Basically, she yelled at me for being dishonest, claimed that I was acting like being married to her was charity, and also said that I had insulted her intelligence and embarrassed her in front of her friends and family, as she told them all that she found the ring. I apologized and told her that I didn\u2019t want to see her depressed, but she refused to listen.\r\n\nShe ended up locking herself in our bedroom. I tried apologizing again, but all she did was slide the ring under the door towards me. All this just made me confused and conflicted about the entire situation.\r\n\nAITA for getting her ring replaced?", "created_utc": 1702854400, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18ktygw/aita_for_having_my_wifes_missing_ring_replicated/", "score": 160, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

When your wife \"found\" the ring, she didn't just find a lump of metal and rock. She found a lost connection to her grandmother. She found memories and love.\n\nAnd when she found out the ring was a replica, she lost her grandmother again. She lost those memories and that connection. She's been hit by a wall of grief all over again, but this time. You're to blame.\n\nYour heart was absolutely in the right place, but you really messed up. Apologise to her for causing that pain. Suggest that maybe the ring can be a new heirloom for you both to attach your own memories to, but also in honour of her grandmother. It can never be the original, and you were wrong to pretend it could, but you hope that maybe, it can be a link to those memories, and ones that you will create together.\n\nAnd if you lied about the 9k you spent in secret. You're in even more trouble.", "YTA \n\nHer reaction is less about you replacing the ring and more about all the lying you did.

For how you thought it would play out in any other way? It could have been a really nice gesture. A new ring and a card saying I know it can\u2019t replace the old ring but let\u2019s start a new tradition with this one. Or something like that. Better start apologising", "YTA, not for getting it replicated, but for lying.  \n\nIt\u2019s clear that you did what you did out of love, but I totally understand why your wife would feel like it\u2019s a violation of trust.  You probably made her feel like a moron, since she went on and on about how happy she was to \u201cfind it\u201d while you knew the whole time that you had placed it there for her.  That\u2019s how I would feel in her shoes.  I would feel humiliated, and then infuriated.\n\nThat ring had huge sentimental value to her, and the new one just won\u2019t have that.  But you pretended that it was the same one, and that was obviously going to hurt when the truth was revealed.\n\nAs someone else has pointed out, if you\u2019d just given her the replica and said something like \u201cThis can\u2019t replace the lost one, but I wanted you to have something to remind you of it at least\u201d she probably would have been thrilled and touched over how thoughtful and kind such an act would be. But you poisoned that ring in her mind by lying about it from the start.", "YTA\n\nYou might want to stop sayng \"you didn't explicitly say no\". You KNOW that is what she meant. You know she didn't want it replicated. So stop with the \"technically she didn't say no\" -- that's insulting her and her intelligence, and it shows that you think your opinion matters more and is more \"right\" than hers is.\n\nApologize WITHOUT justifying it.

It was a great idea but she wasn\u2019t into it and that\u2019s where it should have ended - as an idea.", "YTA\nAnd when her cat dies, you will also buy a new one and tell her \"Oh look, she's alive again\"?\n\nShe lost her grandma's ring. She did not want a replacement. You spent tons of money to trick her. That's a weird logical from your side.", "YTA.

You should have respected her decision, and you absolutely should never, ever lie to her for her own benefit.", "YTA. Your heart was in the right place but you clearly just don't understand the emotion behind the ring and the fact you plain lied. \n\nCHECK THESE SPOTS: I just want to add that your should tip over your dressers and nightstands.

YTA", "YTA though unintentionally. What you wanted to do waa very sweet, but you should have just told her about having it remade and presented it to her like that. The replication of the ring isn't where you messed up, its the charade of the hiding it and her magically \"finding\" it.

Good luck!", "The classic trying to fix a problem instead of just empathizing with your wife.", "God I was thinking it was a really sweet story until you hid it in the sofa for some unfathomable reason instead of just giving it to her. What is wrong with you? YTA.", "Soft YTA\n\nReplacing the ring seemed to come from a place of caring, but dishonesty in a relationship breeds distrust and I can understand why she felt insulted. I don't like being lied to either. Most people don't. You're not the AH for \"getting her ring replaced\" and wanting to make her happy. The issue is you deceived her and made her think she'd found *her actual ring*. If you'd gotten it replicated and presented it to her and made it clear that it wasn't the real ring, and *she still got mad at you* then I would go with NTA, but that's not what happened. You deceiving her (even tho your intentions were good) is what makes you in the wrong. At this point I think all you can really do is let her cool off and maybe try eventually explaining to her that your intention was not to insult her or embarrass her. You were trying to make her feel better, but you understand now why she got upset. Hopefully she'll let it go eventually. But yea don't do anything like this again. lol As a general rule, people don't like to be lied to especially over something that has sentimental value.", "YTA.  Dude.

You broke her trust by lying to her, you need to fix it.", "good luck. give her space to be angry, and hopefully you two can work through this.", "It\u2019s like there\u2019s a connection missing in his brain. I wonder if he does stuff like this a lot?", "Shut up lol", "What?", "I\u2019ve always thought forcing a partner to sleep on the couch is ridiculous. Solves nothing, helps nothing. To suggest a hotel is just insane", "Lying to your partner about something this monumental is also insane.", "I wouldn\u2019t say monumental but yes it\u2019s completely wrong and the guy doesn\u2019t seem to understand that the deception is the problem."]}
