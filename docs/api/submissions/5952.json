{"id": 5952, "submission_id": "zy7nlb", "title": "AITA for telling my best friend's parents he has been lying about attending college for over a year?", "selftext": "My best friend is also my college roommate. We've roomed together in a rental house all 3 years. We share the same friend circle, we're super close with each other's families, we're basically brothers. And he's ruining his life. \n\nWe split utilities and rental house bills evenly--some are in his name, some are in mine. 6 months ago I got a notice that he wasn't paying a bill and we were going to have our electric shut off. I confronted him about it, thinking he had just forgotten or was maybe tight on cash, but ended up unraveling a series of lies that led to me learning that he actually hasn't been enrolled in classes for the last few semesters and had been hiding it from everyone he knows.\n\nNote: He works part time to pay a portion of his tuition. His parents give him money for rent, utilities, etc. But this isn't a spoiled trust fund baby story, his parents aren't well off and work really hard to put him in college. \n\nA while ago he missed a tuition payment and was forced to unenroll. Instead of telling his parents, he tried to cover it up and get it all figured out on his own. Cue a year of missteps and small lies turned big lies. He confided as much of the story to me as he needed to and tried to persuade me to keep it between us. I agreed, under the condition that he can't lie to me about this anymore and if he's going to fall behind on utilities or anything, he needs to tell me. I also told him he really needs to pull his parents in on this but he was sure he could figure it out. \n\nFast forward 6 months to yesterday. He still hasn't told his family, hasn't gotten re-enrolled, and isn't working that part-time job anymore. He was home visiting family. I get a knock at the door. It's the utility guy here to shut off our electricity if I don't make a payment to him right now. \n\nAfter making the payment and stopping our electric from getting turned off, I sent him a text. \"Tell them or I will\" is the gist, said more gently. He refused, so I called his mom. My thought process is that he's with family right now, they are his support network, and they want to see him succeed.\n\nI tried to be gentle about it, but there's no way to break this news gently. He had been telling them names of instructors, fabricating what he was learning in class, etc. At this point, they knew he was at least a semester or two behind, but thought it was a weird scheduling/course issue. What I didn't know was that he was currently with other family on a fishing trip.\n\nI got a text from him an hour later basically saying \"Not cool, bro.\" So I guess she reached out while he was on the trip. I told him that this is what needed to happen, as much as it might suck right now and I haven't heard anything since. \n\nI'm sure there are better ways this could have been handled, but with how it went down, AITA?", "created_utc": 1672326685, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zy7nlb/aita_for_telling_my_best_friends_parents_he_has/", "score": 302, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You know who can kick him out? The landlord. Roommates do NOT have the authority to remove other roommates unless one roommate is subletting from another. You know what happens if you kick someone out in the US without proper notice? Bad things. In fact, some states allow for treble damages for illegal evictions, so if I was \"kicked out\" by a roommate, had stuff damaged, had to pay for an emergency storage locker, housing, etc, I could get back three times what my losses were. \n\nAlso you are wrong.

The kid needs help sure, but I\u2019ve seen too many families who don\u2019t do the right thing and OP intentionally meddled with something he can\u2019t possibly know everything about. \n\nAgain, as I said he could have brought up the electrical bill and let this kid figure out what and how to explain to the parents. OP took a chance on this kid\u2019s life and relationship with his family to tell them something that isn\u2019t any of his business. Has it not occurred to anyone that generally people don\u2019t trip over themselves for years trying to lie to everyone they know without a reason? Did it never occur to anyone that this kid\u2019s reason may be that he felt unsafe sharing certain things with his parents or that the kid knows his parents won\u2019t actually help? Sure, they may do the right thing, but none of us know that and a kid has spent an entire year building a lie to numerous people and no one thinks, hmmm, maybe he\u2019s scared of something and maybe he has a right to be? OP crossed the line by bringing up anything outside of the bill not being paid. It simply wasn\u2019t his place to do so", "Part-time hourly work sucks and is unreliable. He probably couldn't get enough hours or something to that extent. Also possible he spent more than he could afford on video games or food and it had a ripple effect when the payment came due.\n\nBut this is speculation. I don't have a solid answer for where that original payment went wrong.", "NTA. You cannot sacrifice your safety and housing to help him lie. This is all an outcome of his behaviour.", "\"I think you might be confusing me with you.
