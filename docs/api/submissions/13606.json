I want to thank everyone for commenting and giving advice, sorry I couldn't get to you all. I wasn't expecting to make an update but there's been a development. Before that, I want to address a few things.\n\nMany commentators said that my GF is a narcissist or has some personality disorder. Probably should have mentioned this before but she has ADHD (which she is medicated for) so she has always been pretty scatterbrained. However it did get noticeably worse when we moved in together such as blowing plans because she either forgot completely or forgot the part where we agreed on them, or completing forgetting to do any errands or chores because she is just so invested in something, usually an art project.\n\nThere was one comment that resonated with me that said that I must have been conditioned to accept this kind of behavior. That is accurate, my parents always instilled into me to be grateful and happy for getting anything at all because they got nothing when they were younger. If I got a sack of s\\*\\*\\* as a gift, I was expected to dance like happy prospector if this at all explains my tolerant/doormat behavior.\n\nThe Update: despite using a throwaway, my GF still found the post. She was very miffed by the responses and tried to vent to her friends but they weren't on her side. She then decided to show the post to her and my siblings. They wanted to know if it was true and when confirmed they all yelled at her and they got our respective parents calm down and stop talking about it.\n\nShe came to me over the weekend and after talking about it since then we kind of worked over several things. She recognized that she really did screw up and as an apology she gave me this cool dragon diffuser I've been wanting for a while and a box of all the stuff I was gifted telling me I may do whatever I please with them. She's also open to not receiving gifts for the next couple of special occasions which I will be doing.\n\nSo when it came down to her selfish gift giving, apparently what she meant by \"I tried\" was her forgetting about these occasions up until the last minute and not wanting to admit it. She hastily gets them off of Amazon from what ever shows up first on her homepage and just hopes I'll like them enough to not say anything negatively and uses them when I won't. She refused to look at my wishlist because gifts should be a surprise but when I brought up her list, she had no answer. She said she'll look at mine from now on.\n\nI don't think this is a deal breaker but it does need to end and well most of you were right, there were other issues. We have agreed to therapy, single and couples which she will pay for. This may not what you were expecting but I think its a good start.", "created_utc": 1680226519, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/127603c/update_aita_for_trashing_the_gift_my_girlfriend/", "score": 1332, "replies": ["So she constantly forgets your bday, and rather than spending 10 mins to find something you might like, she just picks something from her amazon in hopes that you will like it?

Hopefully, you will be able to work it out, but either way, the therapy will help both of you. She'll be able to work on her behavior patterns. ADHD, even if medicated, does weird things and can cause anxiety and procrastination, causing strange results like the gift-giving issue. You'll be able to work out some smaller issues from your own past; as you mentioned, you were raised to just appreciate anything and not put your foot down. You'll both benefit from it.

It took your gf finding your Reddit post to admit to lying to you about her \u201cforgetfulness\u201d only after she tried to manipulate the situation, rally family members to take her side AND try to make you feel bad about her \u201cforgetfulness.\u201d She displayed no remorse until she was faced with enough backlash to finally self reflect!? \n\nAnd had you not resorted to outside advice (Reddit) she would have [likely] continued her shit givings every birthday and allowed you to accept her shitty behavior out of\u2026guilt?!\n\nAND, still, none of this explains why she chose last minute gifts from HER Amazon wishlist? \n\nThat\u2019s insane. Good luck, brother.", "Look I'm glad you were able to communicate and come to a solution. I am also glad to hear the therapy aspect, and hope when you say individual therapy that includes her receiving individual therapy... \n\nSomething I've heard and often say, ADHD (or mental health in general) is not my fault but it is my responsibility. \n\nEdit to add: the below story and comments are really here to hopefully highlight the behaviour of your partner is not because if ADHD. Pure and simple, her behaviour, attitude and actions are disgusting, lack accountability and respect for you and your relationship.  \n\n\nI have ADHD, it is pretty severe.  I do some weird shit and often forget things, however ADHD is not an excuse to treat others like shit. I get super overwhelmed at gift giving and often suck at it, but it is my responsibility and part of being in a healthy relationship to communicate this and ensure I put in the work to manage these feelings and actions. \n\nADHD may be a reason for some of my behaviour or actions but is not an excuse. It certainly isn't an excuse to treat anyone (let alone my partner) like shit. \n\nMy partner is amazing and does support me when my medication isn't working well or when I am off medication for managing tolerance or just flat out having a shitty ADHD day. It does not mean I don't have consequences for my shitty behaviour, it means he will remind me a few extra times when needed or support me when I crash and struggle on chores for example. It may mean giving me leeway in the moment when I struggle with my emotions. It does not mean I am free of consequences or allowed to treat him like crap. My part is also ensuring that if i do, I take full responsibility and acknowledge this fact. I make sure I do better as we both deserve loving and supportive partners...", "I commented on the original post and I still stand by what I said, the new information doesn't change that. I have ADHD too. I would never do this to someone I love, I would prefer to let them know that I got mixed up on dates, let them know that I'm sorry, and get them something late. This might not be her DELIBERATELY getting herself things via you, but it's still wildly disrespectful.  \n\n\nAlso very telling that she didn't believe the comments on the original post, didn't believe her friends, and it took BOTH your families telling her that she's wrong for her to accept it. That doesn't sound like someone who's been making mistakes and panicking. It sounds like someone who was 100% ok with what they were doing, to the point that they can't believe anything is wrong.", "I don't...quite care for the idea that she just kinda...randomly gets something based off her amazon preferences as an after thought, but I'll admit this was progress all the same.\n\nA little honesty in your failings goes a long way, and frankly the mystery in gift giving is overrated. It creates an unnecessary \"test\" in relationships. I'd personally rather receive something matching my wants.", "Uh, she needs medication because she\u2019s only barely functional", "She is a 30 year old woman pulling this crap. WTF! And when she didn\u2019t get the response she wanted, she ran to family to pick sides. She is as selfish as they come, and I don\u2019t think it is going to get any better. She only decided to work on it because she was called out by everyone she knows. Of course she has to try to \u201cchange\u201d\u2026\u2026.for them. It\u2019s for appearances only.  The telltale sign: you brought the issue up and she did nothing but plant her feet harder in the ground. She didn\u2019t care to listen to what you were saying or be sympathetic towards your feelings. When others got involved, she decided to do better. So she has to be called out by the masses to get her act together? Get out now while you can. You deserve so much better. \ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9", "YTA. How nice of you to have everyone gang up on her.", "Honestly...people stop blaming ADHD or some forms of autism for all evils! Being inconsiderate or rude or selfish has nothing to do with the above. She forgets and she is shopping at the last minute but she only see in front of her things she can only like and use? Does she cares at all about her bf? Does she listen to him? Lists are bad for others but good for her presents? She is just selfish and uncaring. Sorry for using \"heavy words\" but almost everyone justifies simple truths with something else. I also forget and my brain is working strange. I use Google calendar for events, I write things to paper calendars, to post it. If you actually care you always find a way.", "OP, I am glad you worked through this with your partner, and that you will be getting therapy together.\n\nIt is, however, unfortunate it took so many other people to get her to see that she messed up.  Especially when her later \"excuse\" basically says that she knew that she was not giving you anything you wanted.\n\n*She hastily gets them off of Amazon from what ever shows up first on her homepage and just hopes I'll like them enough to not say anything negatively and uses them when I won't.*\n\nThis doesn't really hold up.  Because when you DID say something negative, she got furious, because she wanted the gift for herself.  It had nothing to do with not admitting she messed up.  She was deliberately shopping for herself.\n\nThe ADHD really does not explain why she always managed to get gifts for herself and not for you.\n\nI hope the counseling brings you greater clarity as a couple.  Because, while I appreciate that she is planning not to continue this particular behavior, I don't think you've really solved the issue of why she was doing this to begin with.", "I know this sub has a habit of confidently condemning whole relationships based on tiny snapshots of people's behaviour...\n\nBut the cynic in me does wonder how much of this \"update\" was really pushed for / shaped by the GF trying to sanitise her reputation with friends and family who've been shown the original post.\n\nThe \"I forget then quickly order off my own amazon\" excuse feels crafted more for that audience's benefit than OP's.", "No OP, she\u2019s manipulating you once again.

Or rather. If you don't use it, neither does she. \n\n\nI forget to get people gifts on time in occasion. It's not that i forget their special day but i procrastinate on when i get the gift. But i even if i know the gift won't get there in time i still look for something that it's a good gift for that person and occasion and just be truthful that hey your gift is on the way. And give them the option to see what it is (Amazon purchase history) or to let it be a surprise when it does arrive.

She doesn't respect you as a person, do you honestly see that changing?", "She's not sorry and your TA to yourself for staying with someone who thinks so little of you.", "This should actually be a dealbreaker", "Yep, that's right.

First red flag is the fact that once she found the post, she was going around seeking validation from her friends and your siblings. What she wanted to do there was have a bunch of people on her side and make sure you're the bad guy. \n\nThat didn't work so her excuse was \"I forget until the last minute\". I think that's even worse than just being honest. Firstly, no one forgets a loved one's birthday unless they have Alzheimer's or something. ADHD makes people scatterbrained for sure, but not to the point where they forget the birthday of someone they've been with and loved for a while. Besides which, she doesn't live under a rock. She has a mobile phone and a phone has a calendar app. If she \"forgets\" important events, why not use that to send her reminders every now and again? So I think that's another bs excuse on her part. \n\nAlso, the fact that she's now giving you the gifts you've wanted all of a sudden and being open to not receiving gifts from you isn't because she's being caring. It's to get over her guilt and make you forget what happened. Google something called \"love bombing\" and you'll see what I mean. \n\nI noticed in the last post you said in a few comments that you don't see the need to break up because all this is a first world problem. The truth is that I (and I'm sure most people who read this post) feel that all this is just a small part of the bigger issue. You said that you don't think she's a narcissist, but she's definitely showing a lot of traits. I've grown up around a narcissist and a lot of what you're saying is similar to one of my parents. You want to start therapy and that's great, but what I will say is please look at the bigger picture. If you end up having kids with your gf, her behaviour will affect them too. Please think about that and take time to think about whether you want to be in a relationship like this.", "The excuses in the post are honestly depressing. She found the post and tried to smear OP and get public opinion on her side. That failed, so she issued a performative apology.

I have a gift stash in my closet for all kinds of friends. \n\nFor my husband, I keep a running list of gift ideas in my phone and I have about 20 calendar alerts that ping me before his birthday.

There are strategies to cope with this that would at least keep this stuff to an occasional oops rather than a constant pattern. \n\nIf I had to guess, based on OP saying she got worse when they moved in together, I would guess that she shifted a lot of the mental load of timekeeping to OP when they moved in together.

Missing a train, bus, airplane, or leave time for work is directly and personally impactful, and can lead to you but having income to survive or completely missing out on something personally imperative. Someone else's birthday is also a bit \"random\" as it relates to yourself and the relatively infrequent amount of times it happens, so it's much harder to remember. \n\nThere's also a big difference between remembering a birthday and acting upon that knowledge. I may remember Christmas is coming repeatedly, but taking the time to prepare in advance for it, like buying gifts, is much more difficult to instigate. Same with birthdays.

I forget things often. Like VERY often. Yes, I have missed my bf\u2019s birthday before and legitimately forgetting to buy a gift is a thing even if you set a million reminders. Most ADHDers I\u2019ve read about/know seem to experience the same dilemma when trying to start and complete a task: executive dysfunction. This is specifically when you cannot *bring* yourself to do a task that might be so simple to others but to us it\u2019s nearly impossible; however, *once we begin the task we are usually able to complete it to a satisfactory degree.*\n\nNow, I\u2019m not talking about big projects that take a long time like painting, knitting, woodworking, etc. I\u2019m specifically talking about tasks like dishes, vacuuming, chores in general or, you know, *buying someone a gift*.\n\nSo when it comes to buying a gift for someone, the struggle is with: 1) remembering to do it and 2) getting yourself to do it (although let\u2019s be real it\u2019s not hard to get online and look for something and buy it). I know personally, along with others, I hyper-focus on gifts and end up searching for hours for the perfect gift for someone, sometimes over the course of days.\n\n*What she is doing is not because of her ADHD.*\n\nShe is putting no thought or effort into what she\u2019s getting you and considering you have a wishlist, she doesn\u2019t even have to! It\u2019s made so easy for her *especially* if she\u2019s medicated. Her ADHD is not an excuse for her lack of caring and even if you\u2019re not excusing her behavior, it\u2019s not even a valid reason for her to buy the first thing she sees. I mean let\u2019s all be for real here, everyone at this point knows how algorithms work so I have a hard time believing that she genuinely \u201chopes you\u2019ll like it\u201d when she goes to buy it considering you obviously haven\u2019t been into her gifts previously.\n\nI\u2019m calling BS, I\u2019m calling shenanigans.
