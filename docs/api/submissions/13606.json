I want to thank everyone for commenting and giving advice, sorry I couldn't get to you all. I wasn't expecting to make an update but there's been a development. Before that, I want to address a few things.\n\nMany commentators said that my GF is a narcissist or has some personality disorder. Probably should have mentioned this before but she has ADHD (which she is medicated for) so she has always been pretty scatterbrained. However it did get noticeably worse when we moved in together such as blowing plans because she either forgot completely or forgot the part where we agreed on them, or completing forgetting to do any errands or chores because she is just so invested in something, usually an art project.\n\nThere was one comment that resonated with me that said that I must have been conditioned to accept this kind of behavior. That is accurate, my parents always instilled into me to be grateful and happy for getting anything at all because they got nothing when they were younger. If I got a sack of s\\*\\*\\* as a gift, I was expected to dance like happy prospector if this at all explains my tolerant/doormat behavior.\n\nThe Update: despite using a throwaway, my GF still found the post. She was very miffed by the responses and tried to vent to her friends but they weren't on her side. She then decided to show the post to her and my siblings. They wanted to know if it was true and when confirmed they all yelled at her and they got our respective parents calm down and stop talking about it.\n\nShe came to me over the weekend and after talking about it since then we kind of worked over several things. She recognized that she really did screw up and as an apology she gave me this cool dragon diffuser I've been wanting for a while and a box of all the stuff I was gifted telling me I may do whatever I please with them. She's also open to not receiving gifts for the next couple of special occasions which I will be doing.\n\nSo when it came down to her selfish gift giving, apparently what she meant by \"I tried\" was her forgetting about these occasions up until the last minute and not wanting to admit it. She hastily gets them off of Amazon from what ever shows up first on her homepage and just hopes I'll like them enough to not say anything negatively and uses them when I won't. She refused to look at my wishlist because gifts should be a surprise but when I brought up her list, she had no answer. She said she'll look at mine from now on.\n\nI don't think this is a deal breaker but it does need to end and well most of you were right, there were other issues. We have agreed to therapy, single and couples which she will pay for. This may not what you were expecting but I think its a good start.", "created_utc": 1680226519, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/127603c/update_aita_for_trashing_the_gift_my_girlfriend/", "score": 524, "replies": ["So she constantly forgets your bday, and rather than spending 10 mins to find something you might like, she just picks something from her amazon in hopes that you will like it?

She reminded me of Homer Simpson buying Marge a bowling ball for her birthday to use himself.", "Thanks for the update. I've been wondering how you guys have been doing. This is a good outcome. Hopefully, you will be able to work it out, but either way, the therapy will help both of you. She'll be able to work on her behavior patterns. ADHD, even if medicated, does weird things and can cause anxiety and procrastination, causing strange results like the gift-giving issue. You'll be able to work out some smaller issues from your own past; as you mentioned, you were raised to just appreciate anything and not put your foot down. You'll both benefit from it. Best of luck!", "Also her medication may not be as effective as it once was.", ">I don\u2019t think this is a deal breaker \n\nDamn dude. It took your gf finding your Reddit post to admit to lying to you about her \u201cforgetfulness\u201d only after she tried to manipulate the situation, rally family members to take her side AND try to make you feel bad about her \u201cforgetfulness.\u201d She displayed no remorse until she was faced with enough backlash to finally self reflect!? \n\nAnd had you not resorted to outside advice (Reddit) she would have [likely] continued her shit givings every birthday and allowed you to accept her shitty behavior out of\u2026guilt?!\n\nAND, still, none of this explains why she chose last minute gifts from HER Amazon wishlist? \n\nThat\u2019s insane. Good luck, brother.", "Look I'm glad you were able to communicate and come to a solution. I am also glad to hear the therapy aspect, and hope when you say individual therapy that includes her receiving individual therapy... \n\nSomething I've heard and often say, ADHD (or mental health in general) is not my fault but it is my responsibility. \n\nEdit to add: the below story and comments are really here to hopefully highlight the behaviour of your partner is not because if ADHD. Pure and simple, her behaviour, attitude and actions are disgusting, lack accountability and respect for you and your relationship.  \n\n\nI have ADHD, it is pretty severe.  I do some weird shit and often forget things, however ADHD is not an excuse to treat others like shit. I get super overwhelmed at gift giving and often suck at it, but it is my responsibility and part of being in a healthy relationship to communicate this and ensure I put in the work to manage these feelings and actions. \n\nADHD may be a reason for some of my behaviour or actions but is not an excuse. It certainly isn't an excuse to treat anyone (let alone my partner) like shit. \n\nMy partner is amazing and does support me when my medication isn't working well or when I am off medication for managing tolerance or just flat out having a shitty ADHD day. It does not mean I don't have consequences for my shitty behaviour, it means he will remind me a few extra times when needed or support me when I crash and struggle on chores for example. It may mean giving me leeway in the moment when I struggle with my emotions. It does not mean I am free of consequences or allowed to treat him like crap. My part is also ensuring that if i do, I take full responsibility and acknowledge this fact. I make sure I do better as we both deserve loving and supportive partners...", "I commented on the original post and I still stand by what I said, the new information doesn't change that. I have ADHD too. I would never do this to someone I love, I would prefer to let them know that I got mixed up on dates, let them know that I'm sorry, and get them something late. This might not be her DELIBERATELY getting herself things via you, but it's still wildly disrespectful.  \n\n\nAlso very telling that she didn't believe the comments on the original post, didn't believe her friends, and it took BOTH your families telling her that she's wrong for her to accept it. That doesn't sound like someone who's been making mistakes and panicking. It sounds like someone who was 100% ok with what they were doing, to the point that they can't believe anything is wrong.", "I don't...quite care for the idea that she just kinda...randomly gets something based off her amazon preferences as an after thought, but I'll admit this was progress all the same.\n\nA little honesty in your failings goes a long way, and frankly the mystery in gift giving is overrated. It creates an unnecessary \"test\" in relationships. I'd personally rather receive something matching my wants.", "Uh, she needs medication because she\u2019s only barely functional", "She is a 30 year old woman pulling this crap. WTF! And when she didn\u2019t get the response she wanted, she ran to family to pick sides. She is as selfish as they come, and I don\u2019t think it is going to get any better. She only decided to work on it because she was called out by everyone she knows. Of course she has to try to \u201cchange\u201d\u2026\u2026.for them. It\u2019s for appearances only.  The telltale sign: you brought the issue up and she did nothing but plant her feet harder in the ground. She didn\u2019t care to listen to what you were saying or be sympathetic towards your feelings. When others got involved, she decided to do better. So she has to be called out by the masses to get her act together? Get out now while you can. You deserve so much better. \ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9", "YTA. How nice of you to have everyone gang up on her.", "Honestly...people stop blaming ADHD or some forms of autism for all evils! Being inconsiderate or rude or selfish has nothing to do with the above. She forgets and she is shopping at the last minute but she only see in front of her things she can only like and use? Does she cares at all about her bf? Does she listen to him? Lists are bad for others but good for her presents? She is just selfish and uncaring. Sorry for using \"heavy words\" but almost everyone justifies simple truths with something else. I also forget and my brain is working strange. I use Google calendar for events, I write things to paper calendars, to post it. If you actually care you always find a way.", "OP, I am glad you worked through this with your partner, and that you will be getting therapy together.\n\nIt is, however, unfortunate it took so many other people to get her to see that she messed up.  Especially when her later \"excuse\" basically says that she knew that she was not giving you anything you wanted.\n\n*She hastily gets them off of Amazon from what ever shows up first on her homepage and just hopes I'll like them enough to not say anything negatively and uses them when I won't.*\n\nThis doesn't really hold up.  Because when you DID say something negative, she got furious, because she wanted the gift for herself.  It had nothing to do with not admitting she messed up.  She was deliberately shopping for herself.\n\nThe ADHD really does not explain why she always managed to get gifts for herself and not for you.\n\nI hope the counseling brings you greater clarity as a couple.  Because, while I appreciate that she is planning not to continue this particular behavior, I don't think you've really solved the issue of why she was doing this to begin with.", "I know this sub has a habit of confidently condemning whole relationships based on tiny snapshots of people's behaviour...\n\nBut the cynic in me does wonder how much of this \"update\" was really pushed for / shaped by the GF trying to sanitise her reputation with friends and family who've been shown the original post.\n\nThe \"I forget then quickly order off my own amazon\" excuse feels crafted more for that audience's benefit than OP's.", "No OP, she\u2019s manipulating you once again. Don\u2019t let her treat you like that, you deserve a partner who values you, the least she can do is admit she is a selfish person.

Or rather. If you don't use it, neither does she. \n\n\nI forget to get people gifts on time in occasion. It's not that i forget their special day but i procrastinate on when i get the gift. But i even if i know the gift won't get there in time i still look for something that it's a good gift for that person and occasion and just be truthful that hey your gift is on the way. And give them the option to see what it is (Amazon purchase history) or to let it be a surprise when it does arrive. I don't give them shit on the fly that would mean nothing to them and be useless\n\n\nBut truly i hope the best for you and your future in your relationship", ">The Update: despite using a throwaway, my GF still found the post\n\nI know it's not the aim of the post but, your story is very specific and contains some personal details.

She doesn't respect you as a person, do you honestly see that changing?", "She's not sorry and your TA to yourself for staying with someone who thinks so little of you.", "This should actually be a dealbreaker", "Yep, that's right.

First red flag is the fact that once she found the post, she was going around seeking validation from her friends and your siblings. What she wanted to do there was have a bunch of people on her side and make sure you're the bad guy. \n\nThat didn't work so her excuse was \"I forget until the last minute\". I think that's even worse than just being honest. Firstly, no one forgets a loved one's birthday unless they have Alzheimer's or something. ADHD makes people scatterbrained for sure, but not to the point where they forget the birthday of someone they've been with and loved for a while. Besides which, she doesn't live under a rock. She has a mobile phone and a phone has a calendar app. If she \"forgets\" important events, why not use that to send her reminders every now and again? So I think that's another bs excuse on her part. \n\nAlso, the fact that she's now giving you the gifts you've wanted all of a sudden and being open to not receiving gifts from you isn't because she's being caring. It's to get over her guilt and make you forget what happened. Google something called \"love bombing\" and you'll see what I mean. \n\nI noticed in the last post you said in a few comments that you don't see the need to break up because all this is a first world problem. The truth is that I (and I'm sure most people who read this post) feel that all this is just a small part of the bigger issue. You said that you don't think she's a narcissist, but she's definitely showing a lot of traits. I've grown up around a narcissist and a lot of what you're saying is similar to one of my parents. You want to start therapy and that's great, but what I will say is please look at the bigger picture. If you end up having kids with your gf, her behaviour will affect them too. Please think about that and take time to think about whether you want to be in a relationship like this.", "The excuses in the post are honestly depressing. She found the post and tried to smear OP and get public opinion on her side. That failed, so she issued a performative apology. She's acknowledged some of the issues but hadn't actually addressed how to handle them properly.\n\nThis sounds like \"I got the absolute bare minimum, and I'll lie to myself that it's all better now\".", "Bro she ain't forgetting about your gift.

Combined they make it difficult to get started on things regardless if they're things you enjoy or necessary tasks, and often it means the person requires that last minute -anxiety to kickstart getting started.\n\nObviously still shitty behavior from the girlfriend to not even spend the effort to find something that OP would like, but not being prepared and not planning beforehand when you need to do something are pretty common ADHD characteristics. Of course that doesn't make it any less hurtful to receive that kind of behavior.", "I also have ADHD & birthdays sneak up on me, so I keep a running list in my phone or things I think someone will like, so I can grab something when I do remember\n\nETA it's also difficult to think of anything under pressure, for everyone but especially people with ADHD, so this is helpful. \n\nThe girlfriend sucks, it takes effort but you should want to do things for those you love", "She chose things off her gift lifts because she refused to look at his because she thinks gifts should be a surprise.

I felt so bad, it never happened again because I started buying gifts throughout the year. I have a gift stash in my closet for all kinds of friends. \n\nFor my husband, I keep a running list of gift ideas in my phone and I have about 20 calendar alerts that ping me before his birthday. He thinks I'm nuts because I start bugging him 4 months out, but I need that lead time. Hurting his feelings by botching his gift is unacceptable to me, so I don't do it. Your girlfriend is just a jerk and I'm sure that manifests in other ways. \n\nI hope you start to care enough about yourself that you don't accept this kind of behavior anymore. You deserve better.", "Op's gf sounds like kind of a jerk. I have ADHD and  am really good at remembering important things but bad at remembering TIME* and def have time blindness and all that, so I just collect stuff and send it to my friends throughout the year, then when I know their birthday is close, I keep it all together and send it .. around then? ... \n\nBUT I (and everyone around me) knows I'm bad with time and my gifts are thoughtful even if they're not always timely. \n\nAlso, I have a series of reminders in my phone for my husband's birthday, we usually travel for his but now I have work events around then so it's harder, so I go out of my way to do other stuff for him \n\n*I may know your birthday is March 31st, but I may not be aware that TODAY is March 31st. \n\nI have an entire week marked in my calendar as \"Amanda's birthday\" because I remember going to her birthday party that week but I don't remember which day so I just aim for around then-ish.", "I think that you have taken some good steps forward. Best of luck, hope it works out.", ">Probably should have mentioned this before but she has ADHD (which she is medicated for) so she has always been pretty scatterbrained.\n\nYeah, man, that would explain completely forgetting birthdays (maybe but not really).\n\nThat definitely doesn't explain this.\n\n>She hastily gets them off of Amazon from what ever shows up first on her homepage and just hopes I'll like them enough to not say anything negatively and uses them when I won't.\n\nC'mon, buddy. That's not believable.\n\nIf she cared about you and this problem, she'd just make a list of potential gifts for you, and have that instead. Or given Amazon has delivery times, take even a small amount of time, ten minutes, to find you something you might like.\n\nIf I'm panicking for a last minute gift, especially if I'm prone to it, I'll have a hidden list somewhere. If not, I'll frantically get something I think my partner would like... something like a pencil lengthener would be crazy to get someone who doesn't draw.\n\nLike, seriously. Pop off your homepage, and onto \"Gift Ideas for Men.\" Then pick something randomly, with a much greater hope. She's just lying to you, dude.\n\nEveryone criticized her behaviour, so she made an excuse, which you have bought hook, line and sinker.\n\n>She refused to look at my wishlist because gifts should be a surprise but when I brought up her list, she had no answer.\n\nYeah, or THAT. Of course she had no answer. This is a lie. She's lying to you. I mean, jesus, \"Gifts should be a surprise, so the surprise is I got you something you don't want at all. Hey, can I borrow it?\"\n\nShe lied to you, tried to rally the family to her side to peer pressure you, realized her behaviour was universally disliked, and decided to lie about it. Please do not fall for this. Leave this woman. This IS a deal-breaker, it's just a question of when you recognize it to be.", "OP - she ain't sorry at all. She's annoyed everybody took your side.\n\nGood luck with therapy but I think she's faking.", "NTA\n\nBackground info: I'm severely ADHD. Diagnosed back in the early 80's. Back then when it was still 'new' they were throwing everything in the medical cabinet at us kids to see what would work. Because of those meds I was almost unable to join the military because some of them were heavy duty mental drugs, (because like I said they were just using us as guinea pigs).\n\nWith all of that being said, and with the understanding that everyone is different even with the same diagnosis, she needs to get her shit together. She needs to actually address it and take steps to deal with it instead of just blaming her issues on ADHD. It can be done, it just takes work. I am no longer on meds because I hate how they make me feel like a zombie, so I have had to devolp methods for myself to keep my life straight. I have a 4' tall dry erase board on the side of my fridge that I make daily, weekly, and monthly checklists on so that everytime I walk through the kitchen which is central in my house I see it. I keep notes with alarm reminders in my phone.\n\nIt can be done, but it requires effort on her part. And while she needs to do it, regardless of her relationship status just for her own life stability, you will need to play a part in it and help her with it, with understanding, and **communication** (the #1 killer of relationships when it isn't there). It will most likely be frustrating. But you guys can do it :)", "I don't know if she's a keeper", "Having this condition does not seem like an excuse to me, even so, from what I understand, people take measures like this, she could have done many things such as writing down your birthday in a visible place, setting an alarm, even asking you to remind her 2 days before like that the gift would continue to be a surprise, what worries me the most is that she had to consult with her friends and half the world to accept that she was the bad one, it is worrying because there will be times when she will not be able to consult with anyone and, as things look, she never will recognize", "She isn\u2019t sorry at all. The only reading she\u2019s doing any of this is now all her friends and family think she\u2019s an asshole and she\u2019s worried about her image. She doesn\u2019t care she hurt OP\n\nHer excuse also doesn\u2019t explain why she would get mad at OP for trashing the gift. Because her excuse is BS.", "Yeah, that doesn't hold up. She couldn't spend literally 5 seconds typing OP's most obvious interest into the search bar?", "That is the sanest explanation ever! /s", "I mean. I do tend to wait till the last minute to do things for birthdays. I\u2019ll buy the birthday card the day off for family (though that\u2019s because last time I bought it ahead of time it ended up lost because someone else moved it and didn\u2019t tell me). But I wouldn\u2019t go on Amazon and by the first thing that\u2019s recommended for me. Because that\u2019s stupid and that\u2019s a recommendation for me based off of previous purchases so that\u2019s what Amazon thinks I want. My dad just had a birthday. We\u2019re going out to eat to celebrate this Saturday though. He got one gift on his birthday and I\u2019m giving him the other on Saturday. But I wouldn\u2019t go out and buy him a video game Amazon recommended. I\u2019m the one who plays those. He doesn\u2019t really play them.", "Totally! My ex was similar with gifts. I would always get stuff I didn't need or that were just cheap. Like the one time he got me a chocolate rose for valentines. It tasted horrible and I would have been content with some good chocolate from the store. \n\nWhen you show them they can push your limit, it never stops. Line will always slowly be moved.\n\n I really don't understand people like this. How can you say you love someone, but act so bad toward them... Op deserves better.", ">This might not be her DELIBERATELY getting herself things via you, but it's still wildly disrespectful.\n\nI mean, let's be honest, probably.\n\nGift recommendations are one click away from your homepage. Why on earth would you stick to what's recommended to you personally?\n\nLike, how do you see \"Pencil Lengethener\", something you'd like, and which OP definitely wouldn't and decide \"Yeah, this will do. No more rushing needed.\"", "This.", "Found the girlfriend. If everyone you talk to thinks you're wrong, maybe you're just wrong \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "There's really no way to spin her behavior into a way that shows she puts any real effort into her gift giving.", "It is typical for the normal meter to be messed up in relationships with problematic people.", "I noticed this too.", "Love goggles...", "Physical stores exist. Even if she forgot, she could probably go to Walmart the day-of and find something he'd kind of like.", "Not true. I only have \"moderate\" ADHD, and the amount of times I can forget birthdays and important events with multiple calendar reminders and even texts from others is staggeringly frustrating for me because I DO care about those people and events. The few birthdays that have managed to permanently lodge themselves in my brain, I'll still \"forget\" about repeatedly. You notice the date, go \"oh, it's X's birthday soon\" and it IMMEDIATELY flees your brain a second later because your brain latches onto a new thought or thing that needs to be done. This repeats over, and over, and over including on the day of and sometimes days after. Heck, I've put in calendar reminders with 10m, 15m, 30m, 1hr, 2hr, day before, and week before reminders as both notifications and emails and STILL been late and forgot the important event between most of the reminders. \n\nAccurate time awareness and future planning is a core component of ADHD symptoms. Someone being important to you isn't always enough to overcome the dysfunction of the brain, it only makes you feel more horrible when you fail. \n\nAs for \"It takes 5 seconds to open the calender on your phone,\" you aren't wrong, but you may be unaware of the absurd amount of time and brainpower it takes to make yourself initiate the process of something so simple. Trust me, I think it is stupid as well, but despite all my years of self loathing about not being able to just do something so simple and easy, I'm still unable to \"just do it.\" I try, I try again, I try harder, and yet...I fail a significant amount of the time. \n\nPersonally, I would have just ordered something they loved late and apologized, and not ordered something random. The girlfriend was definitely still the AH for his they went about dealing with how their brain didn't work. But I don't think it was as malicious as it feels to others whose brain actually works the way it's supposed to.", "Yes this so much... the other day I told a friend that I hadnt seen another friend since her wedding bc I dont know her husband well and would rather meet one in one with my friend sometime but that would not be possible since she is married now. The look on my friends face. Who would have guess that people in non-controling relationships dont get into trouble with their spouses when they spend any time without them", "Neurotypicality is a reason but not an excuse. If she isn't trying to put in place solid coping techniques that will help her remember to celebrate her partners birthday in a way that doesn't come off as totally disrespectful, then maybe she's so disabled that she can't handle a partnership and should work on that. \n\nOr maybe she finds a partner who has lower interpersonal standards and doesn't mind receiving a bowling ball named Homer for their birthdays"]}
