I want to thank everyone for commenting and giving advice, sorry I couldn't get to you all. I wasn't expecting to make an update but there's been a development. Before that, I want to address a few things.\n\nMany commentators said that my GF is a narcissist or has some personality disorder. Probably should have mentioned this before but she has ADHD (which she is medicated for) so she has always been pretty scatterbrained. However it did get noticeably worse when we moved in together such as blowing plans because she either forgot completely or forgot the part where we agreed on them, or completing forgetting to do any errands or chores because she is just so invested in something, usually an art project.\n\nThere was one comment that resonated with me that said that I must have been conditioned to accept this kind of behavior. That is accurate, my parents always instilled into me to be grateful and happy for getting anything at all because they got nothing when they were younger. If I got a sack of s\\*\\*\\* as a gift, I was expected to dance like happy prospector if this at all explains my tolerant/doormat behavior.\n\nThe Update: despite using a throwaway, my GF still found the post. She was very miffed by the responses and tried to vent to her friends but they weren't on her side. She then decided to show the post to her and my siblings. They wanted to know if it was true and when confirmed they all yelled at her and they got our respective parents calm down and stop talking about it.\n\nShe came to me over the weekend and after talking about it since then we kind of worked over several things. She recognized that she really did screw up and as an apology she gave me this cool dragon diffuser I've been wanting for a while and a box of all the stuff I was gifted telling me I may do whatever I please with them. She's also open to not receiving gifts for the next couple of special occasions which I will be doing.\n\nSo when it came down to her selfish gift giving, apparently what she meant by \"I tried\" was her forgetting about these occasions up until the last minute and not wanting to admit it. She hastily gets them off of Amazon from what ever shows up first on her homepage and just hopes I'll like them enough to not say anything negatively and uses them when I won't. She refused to look at my wishlist because gifts should be a surprise but when I brought up her list, she had no answer. She said she'll look at mine from now on.\n\nI don't think this is a deal breaker but it does need to end and well most of you were right, there were other issues. We have agreed to therapy, single and couples which she will pay for. This may not what you were expecting but I think its a good start.", "created_utc": 1680226519, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/127603c/update_aita_for_trashing_the_gift_my_girlfriend/", "score": 42, "replies": ["So she constantly forgets your bday, and rather than spending 10 mins to find something you might like, she just picks something from her amazon in hopes that you will like it? Wtf", "I\u2019m glad you had a conversation about it. Her behavior is still really weird and abnormal though. I\u2019d be wondering if she slides back into her shitty gift giving.", "I'm glad you are getting therapy, both as a couple and individually. However, your GF is full on cow manure....you have a wish list, yet she continues to buy from her Amazon hoping you will like it? She was angered that people aides with you on this post so she showed her friends and BOTH you families? Used her diagnosis as an excuse to be selfish? My dude, please take off the rose colored glasses and see flags that are waving on not just flags, they are marinara in colour.", "I am not 100% sure she really doesn't \"forget\" about it and buys the first thing she sees on Amazon, but I hope she changes. You definitely deserve an attentive partner.", "I'm glad you were able to talk it out and are going to therapy. I was worried when you said she showed the post to everyone she knew - this is typically a sign that someone is going to use outside pressure in an argument that should be just between two people - that they are going to try to in by peer pressure. It happened to blow up on her this time, but you might want to keep this in mind in therapy.\n\nStill - you have a good start. Good luck!", "This is a good start, but I hope it has helped to recognise other ways her selfishness displays itself in your relationship. Meal choices, Entertainment, restaurants, activities, vacations, house furnishing...... How is money and chores divided? Things don't have to be eactly even to be fair.  Keep evaluating,  and be realistic.", "Wow it took multiple people to disagree with her before she even agreed to fix her behaviour and apologise, first she went looking for people who would agree with her.   \n\nAre you sure she is sorry ?    \n\nI'm sure if there had been even been one person who agreed with her you would have not got that apology and she definitely would not have rectified her behaviour.", "This is actually an awesome update, thanks. She reminded me of Homer Simpson buying Marge a bowling ball for her birthday to use himself.", "Thanks for the update. I've been wondering how you guys have been doing. This is a good outcome. Hopefully, you will be able to work it out, but either way, the therapy will help both of you. She'll be able to work on her behavior patterns. ADHD, even if medicated, does weird things and can cause anxiety and procrastination, causing strange results like the gift-giving issue. You'll be able to work out some smaller issues from your own past; as you mentioned, you were raised to just appreciate anything and not put your foot down. You'll both benefit from it. Best of luck!", "Also her medication may not be as effective as it once was."]}
