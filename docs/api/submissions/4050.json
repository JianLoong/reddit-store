She does nails from home, but is really cheap and spends almost all her profit on disposable vapes and Lucozade. I have a 3 month old and I lost my boyfriend of 8 years to a car accident last month. I've been fortunate enough to live in a country with paid maternity leave but I'm now missing an additional income. My friend (not relevant here reall) Kathryn, let me move in with her, rent free. Regardless of that, it's still been a major struggle and things are really piling on top of me. \n\nMaternity leave here is paid by the government, my employer doesn't \"top me up\" like some do, so I'm currently on about half of my normal income. I used to be able to \"lend\" leah money whenever she asked, I put it in quotation marks because I genuinely can't remember the last time she paid me back. \n\nI lent her money about a week and a half before my boyfriend passed, about \u00a320, and I really needed it back this week since I haven't had any luck with friends or parents with it being December and all. I asked my sister if I could have the money I lent her back and she told me I told her she didn't have to pay it back. \n\nI haven't been over there much, and our only conversation has been over text, so I sent her a screenshot of where she said she'd pay me back and told her I needed it, that I was running out of baby stuff. She told me she didn't have it to pay back and I said she'd better pay me back when she does nails for a friend of mine tomorrow. \n\nLeah said she needed a new vape so she could only give me \u00a310 and I told her she doesn't need a new vape but my baby does need to eat, and she had promised she'd paid it back. She texted back \"whatever\" and a middle finger emoji. \n\nI told her in a voice message that she's never to ask me for another thing again, and called her an ungrateful little bitch. She told our parents, who understand why I'm upset but telling a 16 year old never to ask for anything off her big sister again is unreasonable and I was taking it too far.

Not 12. She runs her own small business. She should have enough of an understanding of life in general to know what she\u2019s doing. You lent her money. She needs to pay it back. She didn\u2019t. Your not giving her more. Seems pretty straightforward to me. \nConsidering she is spending her money on a new vape rather than what she owes people shows that she does still have maturing to go, and a lot of it, and it should not be at the expense of your CHILD being able to EAT.", "NTA.\n\nPlease don\u2018t help your sister anymore. She\u2018s selfish and cruel! \n\nI can\u2018t understand how she can behave like this \u2026", "NTA. Why don't your parents pay you back then.", "NTA,but why were you giving her money in the first place? She has a job. She needs to learn how to budget her money. Tell your parents to teach her better.", "NTA\n\nYour parents are unreasonable saying that it was reasonable that a 16 yr old should be asking for things from her big sister. You didn't have her, your parents did, she needs something she should be asking your parents, full stop. Your parents can't afford to give her extra? then it's time your sister learns about some things called priorities and budgets.\n\nDon't expect to see any money you gave your sister back. Don't give her anything in the future.", "NTA. But, lending money never turns out well. Think of it as a lesson learned and don\u2019t lend money to anyone anymore.", "NTA\n\nI hope things get easier for you, and I'm sorry for your loss.\n\nLook, the real crux of the issue here is that your circumstances are unsustainable at present. You lack the support currently to manage childcare and properly grieve and deal with the huge financial offset of losing your partner so recently. It sounds like you have some good people in your life helping you out.\n\nYour sister is a typical 16 year old, without context toward what having a child means or what losing a life-partner means. She probably sees the attention you are getting, the financial support that is going to you, and resents you for it. I'm not excusing her for this, but my guess is that informs her behavior.\n\nRe: your sister, I feel like you have two choices here:\n\n* Cut your sister off over the missing $10, probably meaning cutting her out of your life moving forward. This makes sense, certainly in regards to lending her money. But will eliminate a familial bond.\n* Talk with her openly and honestly, not about the missing $20, but about everything going on in your life and her life, and try to find common ground as siblings. She doesn't deserve the opportunity, perhaps, and it might be pretty stressful to do. It might, might, forge a bond of understanding which will help you both in the long run. If you go this route, count the cash as a loss.\n\nHonestly, either seem like fine calls to me. Just depends on what you want that relationship to be in the future. If she's been a golden child that has treated you like shit over the years, I'd probably go to the first one. If this has only recently fallen apart, I'd probably go second option.", "NTa at all. First of all you are going through super hard times and need the $.\n\nCan you set up gofundme, or modest needs?", "NTA. You\u2019re perfectly right not to want to lend her money that she won\u2019t repay even though she has it.", "NTA. Your sister has a job, she can learn to budget her money appropriately.\n\nAlso lol at her complaining to your parents. If she wants money so badly, why isn't she asking your parents?", "She would literally rather get a stupid vape thing than to make sure her sister's child is able to eat? \n\nYeeeeeeeah no, you are NTA.  She can help herself out from now on.", "You've got alot on your plate. If she can't understand your situation and sympathize with you and only care about her own ass then you don't need to feel bad. Let her deal with her own stuff you deal with you own.", "NTA.\n\nYour frustration is understandable, and you are just trying to provide for your baby in a difficult time.  Also your sentiment in this situation is quite common; your parents have been around long enough to understand that \"never\" is a long time and \"anything\" is too broad a category.  But to a 16yo it sounds serious and that's the point.\n\nI wouldn't blame you if you never loaned her money again (let's hope you eventually have some to spare).  And on a general note, you understand that loaning money to friends and relatives is really a gift that you don't expect to be repaid.  Especially when they ask to borrow again after not having paid you back the first time.", "NTA\n\nShe's being pretty unreasonable not to mention not showing any care or compassion for you or your child.  The only real defense is her age... people that age are often bad with money and a little self centered, but she certainly doesn't seem to care about you at all.", "NTA\n\n\nBut on the side note what kind of expensive ass vape is she buying lol", "NTA", "NTA.  Sister is TA, in a way that a teenager can grow out of, one hopes.  I would have toned it down a bit, but you did get your point across, and I'd advise you that if you are in straitened circumstances you shouldn't be lending money out at all.", "You're NTA. If you were really vindictive,  you would report her unlicensed and most likely unsanitary business to whatever regulatory authority you have where you live.", "NTA. Your parents need to force her to pay back your loans - ALL of them - before she's allowed to spend money on non-essentials.", "NTA. I'm so sorry about your loss.

If they never pay be back, I never let them borrow a single red cent after that. It will actually weed out bad people from your life as well. It isn't about the money - it's about the return of respect, and people choosing not to pay you back, you know damn well they can, shows you that they have no respect for you.   \n\n\nYou didn't even need to talk about all of those other issues you have. Just the single instance of her buying a vape rather than paying you back says a truck load about her integrity - it's low.", "Definitely NTA.
