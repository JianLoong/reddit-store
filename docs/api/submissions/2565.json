We have three children and seven grandchildren. While our marriage\nhad its ups and downs, we loved each other, and have remained deeply committed to each other throughout this time. My husband, unfortunately, has developed Alzheimer's. While our family and I provided care for him for a number of years, his Alzheimer's has progressed to the point where he no longer recognizes us. Due to the severity of his condition, I have had to place him in a nursing home. He settled into his new home, and is well cared for and I visits him regularly, but he rarely recognizes me. These visits are often emotionally difficult, for me. Even when he is having a good day, and is relatively lucid, I am forced to confront the way in which our relationship has irrevocably changed. Through the painful process, I encountered an old friend (m72). He has been supportive of my family and I throughout this time. After a few months, he confessed his love for me, and I have started to realize my feelings for him as well. I, however, feel conflicted. I still love my husband, and feels as though I still owes it to him to remain faithful. Even though I recognizes that our marriage will never be the same, divorce feels out of the question. In my mind, this would be like abandoning my husband. I feel guilty for developing feelings for my friend because of the marriage vows I made to my husband. Our children think I should proceed to date my friend because my husband would not know and it could give me a better, happier life. Some of my siblings and in-laws, however, do not feel the same way. They argue that he is still my husband and deserves to be treated as such until his death. They feel it would be disrespectful to him if I dated another man, and he\nhas done nothing to deserve that disrespect.

NTA. I watched my father die from Alzheimer\u2019s and the toll it took on my mother was awful. I would have been so happy for her if she found someone to comfort her through that. You are wonderful for taking care of him and you completely deserve to find happiness.\n\nETA: your siblings and in-laws don\u2019t get a vote here. This is your life. Your husband could \u201clive\u201d another 10 years or so with this, and you don\u2019t know how many years you have left. Live your one life.", "NTA. He doesn't recognise you. As long as you continue to visit him and care for him, you are not abandoning him.", "First of all, I\u2019m really sorry about your husband. Secondly, I think that you\u2019re NTA. As far as I can understand, your husband is not really there anymore. He isn\u2019t the person he once was, and unfortunately won\u2019t be. \n\nLife is short. Live it as full as you can.

Yes, a marriage is a vow, for better or worse. But it sounds like you have upheld your end and you and your husband had a long and wonderful life together and you have stayed true to your commitment to the degree that you can without it becoming a sacrifice rather than a partnership. Life and love is not always black and white and in this case, I think you would not be wrong to allow yourself to explore a relationship with someone else.  There are marriages that last a week. There are marriages that last 50 years but are riddled with infidelity and abuse. And there are some, that due to tragic and unforeseeable circumstances, do not follow the intended path. You deserve to be happy and the truth is, it will not change your husband's circumstances either way. And it also does not take away what you had. I hope you can hold dearly to the memories you had with him and you can allow yourself some joy and some romance without feeling guilty. NTA.", "NTA. Your kids are fine with it; that's all the blessing you need.", "NAH - First, I am so sorry for your loss. Second, I think you'll find better advice on one of the relationship advice subs.\n\nMy question to you is both simple and complicated. What would your husband want you to do? What would he do if your roles were reversed? \n\nI honestly don't know what I'd do other than try to determine what my husband would do, or would want me to do. \n\nI will say this though...if your friend loves you, he'll wait. \n\nMy mother has Dementia. And I discovered that you go through multiple cycles of grief. First, you grieve because the person you knew is gone and never coming back. Then you grieve when you actually have to move them into care. And finally, you'll grieve once this horrible disease takes them. \n\nI understand wanting and needing that emotional connection you've had for 50 years. Just make sure this is something real on your end, and not a grief response to losing your husband.\n\nI truly wish you the best and hugs from this internet stranger.", "NTA.  Your children are right.", "YTA", "I feel for you, you are in a horrible situation that no one should have to go through. But if you go through with this then YTA.

Your husband - and unfortunately he\u2019s not in a position to weigh in any more. \n\n2. Your children - because your relationship to their father is integral to them. \n\n3. You. \n\nYour extended family can weigh in if you invite them to do so, but what they think or feel doesn\u2019t matter. \n\nI\u2019ve been married half as long as you, but long enough to know that the nature of a long term relationship evolves over time. Yours had evolved yet again due to something bring either of your control, and that\u2019s ok. It\u2019s not unknown for relationships to become open due to an evolution between the couple, and that\u2019s what you are doing here.

Plus, you are still loving and caring for your husband while having someone to share this difficult journey with.", "I don\u2019t know here. You made a vow which is typically stated until death do you part. So\u2026 wait? If this were my story I\u2019d call myself the AH, so I guess YTA.", "NTA-- I've worked with people with Alzheimer's. \"Being faithful to him\" at this point means continuing to be kind and visiting him. I think that your siblings are confusing a theoretical ideal with real life. In reality, he's not married anymore, he probably doesn't even get the concept. All he will be aware of is how you make him feel when you are with him.", "NTA. You've been placed in an impossible situation, and this isn't about disrespect. Your children are right, and to be quite frank, it would normally be the children who would argue against dating, but they love you, they love their father, and they see the situation for what it is. \n\nLife is much shorter than we think. You should always try to grab happiness where you can (as long as it doesn't actively harm anyone else). You do what's comfortable for you. If that means trying out a date to see how it goes, enjoy yourself! If that means that you think again and want to keep that friend as just a friend, that's fine, too! Just make sure that the decision you land on is for yourself, and not something that simply pleases someone else.\n\nAll the best to you!", "Ask the husband how he feels, or if not very lucid \"would feel about a friend doing xyz\"", "Just no. Definitely NTA! Your children are right. I watched my mom go through Alzheimer's for 13+ years. I watched my dad rely on me more and more and after his death, I realized how much harder taking care of my mom was than he ever told us. He spent the final years of his life dealing with her memory loss and even verbal abuse. My mom always told me that she didn't want me to stop living my life to provide the care she needs. I forgot that somewhere along the way and started to lose sight of who I was. I'm trying to get back on track now, and I'm so much younger than you are. Live your life and enjoy a new relationship while you have the chance. Life's too short NOT to take that chance.", "NTA. Please pursue you own little happiness. It's not selfish and you totally deserve it.\n\nI am sorry to say that but... you don't have a husband anymore. Whatever shell of him that is left now is not the man you feel in love with. I am sorry for your loss, truly.\n\nYou dating won't make his life any more miserable, and will improve your life. I urge you to go for it and take any chance at happiness you can.\n\nEdit : Also... keep in mind that at some point, you might meet... his new girlfriend. It's not uncommon that Alzheimer's patient forget their partner and find a new one. If he can, why can't you ?", "I'm so sorry you're dealing with this. It's a similar grief to losing a loved one who passes on, but with fresh reminders every day. Even when you make peace with the situation, it's still so constant, but obviously your own life doesn't simply stop because of it.\n\nI think most people on the outside looking in feel is is very easy to dismiss your feelings on this, and to be fair it's hard to understand. But at this point, it's true that your marriage is over. It's not that you don't still love your husband, it's just that he's gone - but still physically present.\n\nIt's very good to hear your children are so mature and understanding about this - trust them when they support you.\n\nI would exercise as much discretion as you can among people who aren't going to take the time to really understand your situation, but I would not put my life on hold for their sake.\n\nNTA at all.", "NTA. I'm so sorry you are in this situation,  I just cannot imagine how hard it must be for you.\n\nI say go for it. I think if in the future I ever got sick with something like alzeimers and no longer recognised my parter I would want him to be happy no matter what.", "NTA. My mom had severe dementia the last 12 years of her life, and my dad cared for her at home. It was pretty awful. I always hoped he\u2019d develop a relationship with somebody so he could have some happiness in his life. To my knowledge, he never did, and I regret that for him.", "Nta. The person you loved is still there,  albeit fleetingly.  The person that loved you....he left a long time ago.\n\nYour friends and siblings are likely to be of a generation that believed in marriage being \"until  death\". Your CHILDREN who are grieving for the loss of one parent, support you. As said above, it's usually the children who object to a parent moving on, so I congratulate you and your husband for raising such fantastic children.\n\nStep forward into your new life, you deserve it.", "YTA. Loyalty above all.", "NTA. You only die once, but you get to live every day.", "NTA. Your husband is dead, mentally speaking. He may be there physically but he's gone. You're still alive, and who knows how much time you have left as well. As a caregiver, you still have your own needs and wants to balance. Have you ever had a conversation with your husband about how he would like for you to proceed after his death? Would he want you to live your life and be happy until you reunite in the afterlife? There is a way you can reconcile this... It sounds your friend is quite supportive and would be okay with you managing both relationships. You could continue to care for your husband but enjoy your friend's company in your free time. This way you can still say you did your part. Your husband will not have much time left physically speaking. Just as long as you do not abandon the care of your husband, it's okay to have space for feelings towards another person. You deserve to have some happiness too.", "That\u2019s a tough one. You are still legally married to the body but your husband is gone. Maybe you could set some boundaries with your male friend. Maybe you can kiss, hug and hold hands in private. In public if you go out make it more of a friend\u2019s outing. Keep terms off the table. I would suggest to wait a good while before getting intimate past kissing. (Not bc it\u2019s wrong but more bc I\u2019m afraid if you jump into in the next few months you may regret it since you are struggling with how things currently are. I only suggest this to protect your emotional state.) There is nothing wrong with finding a really good friend who supports you and loves you.", "NTA you are a kind and loving wife, but you need companionship too. Things are not black and white, you can do both and still be a good person.", "Hello i recommend you a book 'The State of Affairs' from Esther Perel a therapist ,she have a interesting views about extra marital relationships and she spoke about one of her patient who was in the same situation as you!", "NTA.", "NTA - and really this is beyond judgement.\n\nI am so sorry for your and your family's loss. Alzheimer's is terrible and the cost to the family of a victim of severe Alzheimer's can not truly be understood until you have experienced it first hand.  I have been lucky enough not to have had it in my immediate family but I have seen the toll it takes on extended family and friends and people who are now the shell of people I used to know.\n\nThere is no single right answer here because every person will react differently.  I have seen the spouse drive themselves into an early grave trying to be the sole caretaker, I have seen the spouse remain alone and their children watching helplessly as they suffer,  I have seen families lock their Alzheimer's family member away and pretend they are dead, and I have seen family try to move on with their lives while caring for their loved one best they can.\n\nWith all due respect your siblings and in-laws can get stuffed down a well without Lassie.   You are doing the best you can for your husband and giving him what he needs.  You need to  care for you as well.  There is nothing wrong with trying to find happiness and having a life outside of caring for your husband.\n\n I wish you the best in whatever you decide to do.", "NTA. My partner's grandfather was actually in the same situation. For the last year of his wife's life, he found a new relationship. It made him so much happier, and the entire family as well. They all still cared for the grandma, and respected her, but she was just a shell of her previous self..\n\nSadly, your husband is already gone.

Do you think \"til death do us part\" must be honored if there is abuse taking place? What about if it is an arranged marriage and both parties do not want to be married?
