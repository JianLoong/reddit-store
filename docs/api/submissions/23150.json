I apologize in advance***\nI (28F) was engaged to my ex (36M), let's call him Brandon. Brandon and I met last year, and meshed together very well. Before things got serious I made sure Brandon knew I had endometriosis. Endometriosis in a condition where a woman has difficulty with periods and painful intercourse. This is VERY relevant, I promise. Months after knowing each other Brandon purposed, and I, at the time had no reason to say no. We were set to marry May 2024. Fast forward a few months, Brandon started showing problem signs. He installed tracking data on my phone, I knew nothing about, banned me from talking to my guy friends, hid a file of n**ed women on his phone, and started demanding s**. He would tell me things like \"if you don't have s** with me, you can't expect me to be nice to you\", or \"I deserve as much s** as I want\". This went on for a while. And nothing I did was good enough. One temporary solution to endometriosis is to have surgery. So I did to please him. After the surgery I have to be on rest and cannot have intercourse for 2 weeks. Brandon accused me and the nurse of \"setting him up\" making him wait 2 weeks for s**. One issue was I had to take out my IUD for a few weeks. But since getting pregnant is almost impossible, it wasn't on my mind. A few weeks later, I was pregnant, and very high risk. I was hospitalized for a week with internal bleeding and all he thought about was s**. He said it didnt matter if i cooked, cleaned, and was loyal. He deserved more, and i should give it to him. I even took him on a date night and he ended with \"I hope tonight ends the way I need it to\". When I told him no, he told me he was trying not to cheat on me and that there was plenty of (female parts) all over the sidewalk. He pointed to the women on th sidewalk and said \"look, its all over the sidewalk\". Then he told me that he would refuse to marry me if I can't guarantee I will satisfy him. So I cancelled the wedding, broke up with him, packed up my things out of the house I rented with my name ONLY on the lease, and moved out. It's been 4 months and he is rude to me. Telling me I'm playing victim calling him a bully and verbal abuser. Since I am still very high risk I do not allow him around me, or at appointments since he can not be kind or treat me like anything more than his property. AITA??

I'm so sorry you have to go through this!! Are people believing his rants on FB? I just don't want any mutual acquaintances to relay any information to him about you or where you'll be delivering. Definitely stay far away from him. It's crazy that he thinks abuse is only physical.  Abuse is very much mental and emotional as well. I'm very glad you were able to remove yourself from such an unhealthy and unsafe situation.", "You need advise from a lawyer and a domestic violence advocate. This is domestic abuse and it will continue after the baby's birth. \n\nNTA you're making yourself safe. But at some point please seek therapy. There was a reason for you to say no to the proposal, you just didn't see it. I'm so sorry OP. Please stay safe.", "YTA for bringing a baby into this situation. He was controlling before you got pregnant.", "No one is owed access to your medical events.\n\nDocument everything", "Sounds like my late husband. I had endometriosis too only the back side of my uterus.  So it never got noticed.  I was 40. I had been very upfront about the fact i was not having after a baby after 40. I went to the doctor for my pain. She asked me if the pain or bleeding was the problem I said pain. So I scheduled my hysterectomy.  He was pissed when I got home. Because I didn't \"include \" him in the decision. \n\n\nLet me see  asshole,  I was sick and in pain every month. I FUCKING TOLD you no baby after 40, multiple times. I was so tired of being sick", "NTA. Not in ANY way. Not only did he manipulate you, emotionally abuse you, keep tabs on you like you were property and not a person, etc..he coerced you into sex. Multiple times. He guilted you and threatened you with infidelity if you didn\u2019t \u201csatisfy\u201d him.\n\nCoerced sex is sexual assault. If it\u2019s not a firm yes, then it\u2019s a no. The fact he could continue after the multiple times you were uncomfortable or LITERALLY HEALING, is upsetting to say the least. The fact you\u2019re pregnant and high risk and he still doesn\u2019t seem to care about your well-being or his unborn child is WILD.\n\nKeep you and your baby healthy and happy and keep him out of your life.", "NTA wtf is wrong with this dude?  watching too many Andrew Tate?  seriously.  man, i don\u2019t envy you when it comes to fight for custody.", "I adore you!!", "He's gaslighting you. Make sure you don't share the hospital or delivery information with anyone except your direct support system. Let the hospital staff know that he's not welcome in the delivery room. Also, while i'm not sure at all how it works, I would cover my bases regarding custody and child support.", "Please protect yourself and your baby. He is unhinged. I wouldn\u2019t ever contact him again. Frankly I\u2019d be too scared to stay somewhere he might find me. \n\nI wish you all the best.", "i would contact his mom and tell her to tell him to stop bad mouthing you on social media.\n\nalso, keep all records of what he said about you from social media.  it might be useful during custody hearing.", "I am in the US and unmarried. But I can't stop him from requesting paternity", "Ding ding ding. The judge can prevent you from moving 110%. But if you move first they can\u2019t force you to move back.", "Moving is not an option at the moment. I would be all alone with a baby and my two other children. All of my support is here until my kids are older.", "Be a Harlet!!! (I don\u2019t even know how to spell it but be one my dear!)", "Since we're not married, he has no rights to my child. I can contest visitation. But, not fully prevent him unless he physically assaults me", "I promise, I'm safe where I am. But my fear is after my child comes. He might try to take my baby. He's scary when he is controlling.", "So you lie. Miscarriages happen.", "It depends. If I prove it is for the beat interest for me and child, they won't prevent it.", "Harlot\u2026 but Harlet is cuter. Marked me think of harlequin lol", "That\u2019s not how that works. If he is the father he has rights. Get a lawyer. And if your have the money, get retainers on the other too lawyers in town so they cannot take his case against you.", "In that case, best of luck to you. Definitely NTA, and I hope the rest of your pregnancy goes well.", "Can you get a restraining order? A protective order? Hopefully you can get a lawyer to help you so he can\u2019t legally interfere. \n\nSending you and your baby good thoughts for a safe and healthy life together.", "You just have to be able to afford a better lawyer than him. If he can afford the better lawyer\u2026you will lose. But if you move before\u2026they can\u2019t do anything.", "But it does in the state I'm in. If we're married he has evey right that I do. Can not move or make major decisions without discussing with him first. Since we're not, without paternity being established, he can't take my child or demand anything.", "GET A LAWYER and find out the facts. I think he can demand a paternity test. I know someone dealing with this right now. The baby is born and this guy is making the woman's life hell by making all kinds of demands about visiting the baby, when she doesn't trust he's safe around the baby. (Which he isn't.) \n\nWhether or not you're the asshole isn't the question (NTA). The question is whether or not you and the baby are safe.", "Wouldn't he have the right to establish paternity? I don't see how you can block his eventual visitation or other such parental rights.", "My fear is that he would keep the baby past the time or remove the child from the state without permission or consideration for me or the child", "So he has the right to request paternity. I can not prevent that. But I can request supervised visits due to his unstable behavior", "Listen as soon as baby is born he can have a lawyer at your bedside serving you papers. (If he knows you\u2019ve delivered.) he has that right and you will have to submit baby to the DNA test. That is required in all 50 states. 2. You can request supervised visitation BUT the judge doesn\u2019t have to grant it. STOP sending him ultrasounds. STOP ALL CONTACT. Stop everything. Anyone who might give him information\u2026block them on social media. Lock down social media. It may be best to not even update on social media. You can request full custody with no supervision but it doesn\u2019t mean the judge will grant it.", "And all of that is very true. He was controlling of me, who knows what he will do to get my baby."]}
