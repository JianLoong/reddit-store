{"id": 424, "submission_id": "yi2pme", "title": "AITA for being mad and ignoring my mom because she had my family dog put down without talking to me about it first?", "selftext": "My family has had a dog for the past eight years or so, and though I (26M) moved out of my parents house about a year ago and wasn't presently living with the dog, I still live close by so I do go over there to visit pretty frequently, about once a week at least, so I still cared about the dog quite a bit. For a bit more backstory, my dog had been having some behavioral issues, and would sometimes snap at our two other dogs, as well as people, growling and barking at them, and occasionally trying to bite them. But usually if you left her alone she'd just lay down and be okay after a few minutes. It was like she had a mini psychotic break and forgot where she was. For context she was a terrior/beagle mix and was about 15 pounds, so not a serious physical threat in my opinion.\n\nSo one day a few months back when I was at my parent's house, we had discussed how the vet suggested putting the dog down when my parents told them about the outbursts she was having, to which I said that I didn't agree with it, and actually clearly stated, \"If it comes down to that, I will take the dog and take care of her.\" But at that time my mom assured me that she wasn't going to be putting the dog down, so it wouldn't be necessary, and we agreed that it was better for her to stay in an environment where she was comfortable. A few months go by, and as far as I can tell the dog seems to be doing better whenever I come by; I haven't witnessed any of her episodes, and my parents even said they thought she was doing a bit better.\n\nBut then out of nowhere I get a call from my mom saying that the previous day the dog had bitten her hand and that they made the decision to put her down. I was pretty upset to hear this because I didn't understand why they couldn't have called me before making the decision. Since then I haven't talked to my mom, and have just been ignoring her calls and texts, because I feel betrayed by her since she knew that I wouldn't have wanted the dog to be put down like that. I believe the reason she didn't tell me beforehand was because she didn't want to get into an argument, but I still feel as though it wasn't fair to do something like that when it doesn't take much to just give me a call.\n\nTo be clear, I don't necessarily think they are wrong for making the choice to put the dog down; I think that it's a reasonable choice when you have a dog that is potentially dangerous. I believe there are things that could have been done to help the dog though, but they would require a lot of effort and consistency, which understandably my parents weren't willing to do at the time because of everything else they have going on. What upsets me is that I had already plainly stated that I would have been willing to take the dog myself if necessary. \n\nSo am I the asshole here? Should I just get over it and start talking to my mom again?", "created_utc": 1667197247, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yi2pme/aita_for_being_mad_and_ignoring_my_mom_because/", "score": 8, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The Vet assessed the dog and felt it was the best decision. Your parents didn't tell you because they didn't want to fight with you about it. You already said you would take the dog and they didn't feel that was what was best. If the dog seriously injured someone, it would be on them, too. It's the hardest thing in the world to make the decision to put your pet down.", "I\u2019m sorry you lost your family dog and I understand that you\u2019re grieving, but YTA in this situation and you\u2019re directing your grief into anger at your mom.  You\u2019re acting like this was done behind your back.  You were aware of the problems, you were aware of the vet\u2019s recommendations, your mom told you the dog bit her hand and they made the decision to put it to sleep.  Do you think this was an easy decision for your parents, who undoubtedly love the dog very much? You\u2019re just laying guilt on them, when it honestly sounds like you don\u2019t have a very realistic picture of the amount of time and work (and likely money) it would be if you took this dog in\u2026 which they never agreed to!  It is their dog and they felt it was safest for themselves and other people (and the mental health of the dog) to put it down.", "My parents went through this with a cat. It was feral, attacking anyone who tried to get near it.\n\nSome animals cannot be rehabilitated. The dog's outbursts cannot be controlled or contained. It's unfortunate, but your mom's dog was a danger to everyone around it. Its small size does not matter, it can still do a substantial amount of damage in a short time. \n\nI have no judgment here. It's a sad situation all around. But if you took the dog, by ignoring its random psychotic outbursts and thinking that you could handle it by ignoring it, you would be neglecting the safety of everyone around you.", "She could have called you to let you know what was happening, but as someone who's been bitten on the hand (cat though not dog) let me tell you, the last thing you are doing is thinking about someone who isn't there.  Bites are incredibly painful and can need stitches as well as strong antibiotics. I can't say you're an ah because I understand you loved the dog, but attacking its owner is serious and it may truly have been the best option.  Vets don't casually suggest euthenasia.  Give yourself some time to get over it, grieve the loss of your pet and forgive your mom.", "NTA. She made her decision to avoid an argument by going behind your back, and so now she'll have to live with the consequences (you being mad with her for a while). You should eventually get over it, but for right now, NTA.", "NTA. I would be beyond upset if something like that happened to me. Dogs are family. You do everything for them before the very last resort. I'm so very sorry for your loss.", "NTA. I find it hard to believe that the vet actually told them putting the dog down was the best option. There were a wealth of options, including your option, or rehoming, or behavioral training. They chose to keep the dog in an inflammatory environment and continue, whether consciously or not, provoking the dog to the point of biting. Your parents and the vet are TA's. \n\nI wouldn't talk to them again either", "NTA, I'm really sorry for your loss, my family recently adopted pets...and I can't imagine going through this. While I understand that your parents may have felt overwhelmed, they didn't exhaust all options before taking the easy way out.   \n\n\nYou already stated that you'd be more than happy to help out, but they still didn't want to take your help.", "You're doing exactly what she did. Instead of having a conversation/ argument / fight about it you're avoiding her and the conflict. You're not letting her explain her decision and are jumping to conclusions from what I gather.\n\nHer reasoning might be completely up the walls or completely reasonable. When you've listened to her you have the right to be mad either way.\n\nESH - I don't think you have the right to be mad at her for not talking to you when you're doing the exact same thing now.", "NTA. There are medications that might have helped, and you might have tried another vet for another opinion too. It doesn't sound like the dog was that old, I wouldn't have just given up that fast. I think there were still options to check out if you were willing to do the caretaking.", "NTA IF: You were willing to adopt the dog, pay for training, be available and consistent, and keep the dog away from other dogs and people. If you were willing to do all of those things, you're definitely not an asshole. And your mom is an asshole for doing it without talking to you first. However, if you were planning on just taking the dog and then like bringing it to the dog park, everyone would suck.", "NTA. \n\nYou made it clear you were willing to take the dog. And based on everything else you were clearly involved in the dogs life and they should have called you before making any choice like that.", "NTA-What kind of vet jumps to putting a dog down?  Your mom is the ah and the vet too.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.
