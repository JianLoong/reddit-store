You were responsible for her well-being. I smoke weed as a grown adult, but if I ever found my minor children doing it, I'd flip out lol. It's your job as a caregiver.

She may not ever agree with it, but it's completely valid.", "NTA.  She's 15 and still a child!!  Your parents should not be letting her hang out with this dude.  You totally did the right thing.   She will have plenty of \"moments\" hopefully with decent boyfriends in the future,.", "NTA. She\u2019s a child and you were protecting her. That\u2019s the right call.

Do yourself a favor and fully embrace that 'watching your sister' means no guests (male or female) inside your parents' home.  Do the super conservative thing i.e. what she gets to do.  She will have plenty of time to 'do her thing' later, when she is more mature.   After she turns 18, you can invite her to 'your place' and let her do 'her thing'.", "NTA.

You honestly shouldn\u2019t have been left in the position to look after your sister in the first place.\n\nFact is? You need to now bite the bullet, tell your parents you disrespected them and tell them what happened fully. You need to accept your part in this.

Not even trying to explain that you thought it would be okay as \u201cfriends were allowed over\u201d. \n\nThey\u2019ll have a lot more respect for you if you accept that you made an error of judgement and apologise rather than using their words are a workaround for why you thought it was okay.", "I get that.
