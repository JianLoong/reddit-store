{"id": 9619, "submission_id": "10ytkyh", "title": "AITA for selling my house to my son without telling my daughter?", "selftext": "My husband and I (f48) had good jobs so we got the opportunity to save and buy a house when we got married. Then, as my husband loved to fish, we saved money again to buy a house in a lake near our city. We have two kids Theo (m29) and Lindsey (f26). We used to have family vacations in the lake house quite often as it wasn't that far. \n\nThe house was under my husband's name. My husband got sick five years ago with a terrible illness, he fought all he could but he ended up passing away a year after his diagnosis. As a way to be precautions he passed the properties to me and also the money he had saved up (we had separate savings accounts). He never told me what to do with the money or anything, he just passed all out to me with the help of a lawyer. He also wrote a will for some of his beloved items (his grandfather's car as example) things that weren't expensive but had a emotional value. He left some stuff for me, some for our kids and the rest of his family and friends. After his parting we started a yearly tradition to go there in his birthday to remember him. \n\nAround like 8-9 months ago my son came up to me and asked me what plans did I had for the house, he explained that he wanted to buy a house before his marriage and would love to buy the lake house. I told him I needed to think about it, but then I agreed. My son reminds me of my husband a lot, he loves nature as much as his dad did and he loves that house too, so I knew that it would be in great hands. We did it all legally and the house was sold market price range. My son and his fiance plan to move soon.\n\nMy daughter came home to visit me the other day, she asked me if we were going to the lake house to celebrate my husband's birthday again this year. I told her that we should ask Theo but I'm sure that's not going to be a problem for him. She asked my should we ask him and I told that since it's his house now he gets to decide that kind of stuff. She went crazy when she found out Theo had brought the house. She had the nerve to tell that she feels robbed by me because that's her house too and I didn't asked her. I had to remind her that legally that house is mine, and that I had sell it to her brother, not just some stranger. We ended up having a big argument over this. She said I broke her dad's promise because he told them both that the house would always be theirs to go on vacations, it would never sell or something like that. I didn't knew that as he never told me so, he didn't gave me any instructions about the house. At last I told her to get over it and she left. She also blocked my number and I can't call her. \n\nI think she's overreacting, the house is her brother's home now, it's not like we lost it forever to some stranger. My son and his fiance will sign a prenup too, so in case of a divorce he won't lose the house. But also I understand that she feels heartbroken over that promise that I had no idea of.", "created_utc": 1676039894, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10ytkyh/aita_for_selling_my_house_to_my_son_without/", "score": 867, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Why wouldn't you tell her before you sold to her sibling?  Why would you say \"the nerve\" when she's shocked to be left out?  What went wrong in your relationship?  It sounds like you really hate your daughter, but we don't know why.", "YTA\n\nThe house belongs to you & you can do whatever you want with it. Legally you are not the  A.\n\nIt is also a place where both son & daughter spent they childhood vacations & afterward used it as a father remembrance place with yearly tradition.\n\nSo  I think the fact that you did a whole transaction transforming a family asset to son's asset  **without** informing daughter is not ok.\n\nWhy does son get the chance to buy the family lake house & not daughter?", "YTA - just the wording to daughter alone makes you an AH. You seem.to not care about her. Good on her for blocking you", "YTA. A simple call, \"hey, your brother wants to buy the house, you ok with that?\", not that hard.", "YTA. It was in your name, but it was a family house. Your daughter has just as many fond memories there as your son. Why would you not have mentioned it to her after your son said something? I always find it telling when someone keeps something quiet like this; you most likely already knew this was a bad idea.", "YTA. You either think so little of your daughter that it didn't even occur to you to talk to her about it, or you didn't tell her because you knew she wouldn't be ok with it. Either way, that's just cold.", "Legally no but morally YTA. You may have permanently broken up your family with such a big show of favoritism.", "YTA.\n\nSure, legally it's yours to do with as you please.\n\nBut just at a base level of compassion and family loyalty - Y T A.\n\nIt's not like this was your house that only you're living in and you decided to downsize to an apartment and were selling anyway.  This was property used by the entire family that they all have an emotional investment in and didn't know would be sold...to anyone.  And even though it's still in the family - this is no longer the family vacation house, it is your son's primary residence.  Your daughter is losing out on that opportunity (Edited to fix typo).  That at least warranted a conversation.  You can't sell a house in a day - so in all those days and weeks it took to arrange loans and paperwork, you didn't once have a conversation with your daughter or think to mention it?\n\nThis is about more than just the monetary transaction of house seller to house buyer - it's about the fact you didn't respect your daughter enough to mention it to her until it was already done.  And even then you still didn't mention it until she brought up the house.  It has to be really painful to realize your own mother doesn't respect you and is hiding and withholding family information from you.", "YTA. The lake house isn\u2019t some house. It\u2019s the lake home both of your children made memories with their now gone father. Both children should have equal rights to that home. I\u2019m not sure how you can repair your relationship with your daughter because it looks like she wants to go no contact with you over this and quite frankly I don\u2019t blame her one bit.", "YTA for not discussing it with her. Why would you ever think something sentimental for both of your kids should not be discussed?\n\nYou are absolutely right that it was left to you so therefore it was yours, however it was the place that their father loved and you guys got to spend time together as a family. You really didn't think that your daughter would care that now her brother can call all of the shots when it came to a family home?\n\nI'd be livid too if my parents did not have a discussion about something big like this.", "YTA. You didn\u2019t even tell her!?! There\u2019s nothing wrong with selling the house but you should have told the one child that wasn\u2019t getting the house!!! \n   What if she wanted to buy the house? Is it a sorry your brother reminds me of your dad so you\u2019re screwed? Wow\u2026 I\u2019m sorry for your loss but that doesn\u2019t excuse this.", "Good lord yes YTA. Of course she feels attached to that house, it was a *family* home, where you had *family* traditions. How could you not say anything to her during the whole process of selling??  Honestly how did it not occur to you that she would care or even just like to know??\n\nShe lost a part of her family history *and* learned that you didn\u2019t even think about her feelings in one swoop, no wonder she\u2019s upset.", "I've read your responses. Why are you here? People bring up valid points and you respond very coldly and insist that you are right. Your daughter is not overreacting. She and her brother are not business transactions. They are your children. You were not fair.  You gave your son a chance to buy a treasured family home to have in **his and only his** family forever. You did not give your daughter this opportunity. You did not keep the home in the family for the enjoyment of both your children. but rather sold it for the enjoyment of one. I think it is safe to say you have lost your daughter in the process. Even if there is a reconciliation between you, she will never forget this. Who would?\n\nEDIT:  Oh, YTA, and your late husband would be sorely disappointed in you. Harsh, but true.", "YTA\n\nYes it is your house. You have a right to sell it to whoever you want. But they are also *both* your children. She clearly has attachment to the house, and by not telling her you denied her the chance to try to buy it herself. She didn't know you were willing to sell.\n\nThe problem isn't that you sold the house. The problem is that this ended up treating your children unequally. You acted without thought to your daughter.\n\n>My son reminds me of my husband a lot, he loves nature as much as his dad did and he loves that house too\n\nDoes your daughter remind you of her father at all? Does she also love that house?", "She's not just heartbroken over her father's promise. She's upset because you didn't bother to tell her. Even if your son paid full market value, not being transparent with your daughter was a mistake. You knew it was a place she cared about as well, and as much as you had the right to do what you wanted, she has as much right to her feelings. She's angry that you showed favoritism to your son. When you told her to get over it, of course she blocked you; you doesn't want to talk to you if you aren't going to be a loving parent. You have no right to complain about her anger or blocking you, and you refusing to accept that makes YTA.", "YTA, it was inconsiderate to not discuss it with both of them together, and you clearly favor your son. I wouldn\u2019t answer your calls either.", "YTA. Yes, selling it to your son was totally your call and there's nothing wrong with that decision. But to not even give your daughter a heads-up, especially when it affects a family tradition, seems pretty callous.", "YTA. I wonder what is going on with you and your daughter that you either have so little communication with her that this sale wouldn\u2019t have come up in conversation or you purposely hid it from her. Of course she\u2019s upset. She\u2019s emotionally attached to the lake house the same way your son is, but you only thought of your son\u2019s feelings. Not only does she have to come to terms with possibly losing the lake house and the emotions around that, but even worse\u2026.that her mom favors her brother, both mom and brother kept such a big thing from her, and mom and brother don\u2019t care about her pain.", "YTA. do u hate ur daughter or something? at the very least you don't seem to care about her at all", "YTA - yeah, yeah, your property you can do with it whatever you want.  \n\nJust because you can doesn't mean you should.", "I am gonna say YTA, while your husband left no clear indication of what to do with the house it would have been a better option to talk to both kids, rather than the first one saying I want a house before i get married.\n\nYour daughter in no way is entitled because she still viewed it as a family/holiday home, now those memories are ruined. As is the relationship between you and your daughter and probably your kids too.", "YTA, oh honey, you can try to paint this any old way you like and although technically you can do what you want, what you did was ethically and morally wrong. Enjoy your new relationship with both your son and your daughter because both of them have changed as well as their relationship to each other. What a mess you\u2019ve created, that\u2019s just pitiful.", "My parents have it set so me and my brother get 50/50 of everything. So if I were to want the house I would have to buy his half out. That's what you probably should have done with your daughter.", "YTA \n\nYou made a yearly tradition in his memory to spend the time with your children, and then removed the ability to do that without the approval of your son and his wife.  What if next year there a rift between the spouse and your daughter and she\u2019s no longer welcome?  What if they get divorced and he has to sell?  \n\nUltimately it was your choice, but you didn\u2019t discuss this decision with the people who would be most affected.  How close are you?", "YTA. It's a family vacation home, that she's grown up going to, that you've been using for the tradition of spending family time to honor your late husband, her late father. Yes, you can sell whatever you want to whoever you want. But this was an asshole move. At least tell her you were considering selling it to her brother. I guess you think this is one of those it's easier to ask forgiveness than permission things. Don't be surprised that she disagrees.", "Yta if it wasn't a big deal why hide it? This would be casual converation in my family.", "Whoa. YTA. neither you or your son told your daughter you were selling the house to him. WTF? Surely this warranted a conversation at some point. My guess is this took place over months, not days. You didn\u2019t even pause to think about your annual tradition.", "YTA.\n\nDo you even like your daughter? You started a family tradition of all going to the lake house. Then you sell to the son without even informing the daughter. Didn't inform her for months. Then you think she is \"entitled\" because she was surprised by this info when she asked about the family trip. You claim you never knew about the promise and claim husband never gave instructions about the house. Somehow I doubt that you had no idea of his wishes. Then you tell her to get over it and now have shocked Pikachu face because the did leave and blocked you. Yuck.\n\nWould have taken just a few minutes to tell son that it is a family home, family tradition, and family - including daughter - need to be involved in decision.", "YTA.  Was it technically yours to handle however?  Yes.  Is what you did an AH move?  Also yes.  At the very least, you should have spoken to them together about the lake house.  What you did was unnecessarily hurtful.  I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if your daughter doesn\u2019t want much of a relationship with you.", "YTA.  Yes, it is all your money and property to do as you wish.  BUT, you could have told your daughter about your son's offer.  Your daughter should have had the same opportunity to buy as your son did.  She loves the house and the tradition as much as you and Theo.  \n\nSeems as though you favor the son because, as you wrote, \" My son reminds me of my husband a lot, he loves nature as much as his dad did and he loves that house too, so I knew that it would be in great hands.\"\n\nCan't say as I blame her for breaking contact with you.  She knows now that she will always be second best.  Glad your favorite child is still in your life.", "INFO: When approached by your son to buy the lake house, did you not consider asking your daughter if she would have wanted to purchase it as well? \n\n>After his parting we started a yearly tradition to go there in his birthday to remember him. \n\nWhat did you plan on doing this year after having sold the house to your son? You obviously knew this tradition was going to come up., how would you have explained this to your daughter?\n\n>She said I broke her dad's promise because he told them both that the house would always be theirs to go on vacations, it would never sell or something like that. \n\nDid your son know about this promise prior to him making his offer?", "Having conversation with both children about the lake house never came to mind? YTA", "YTA, \n\nYou didn\u2019t even bother to tell your daughter until everything was done? I hope you don\u2019t fuck up the relationship with your son because that\u2019s all you have now.", "If you feel you did nothing wrong, why did you hide it from her? YTA and deep down you know it, too.", "YTA - This was a vacation home for the whole family that turned into a place to go to remember your husband / their father. The thing to do was to your son it will remain in the family and will get passed to him and his sister when you passed away. Instead you yank it out from underneath your daughter without telling her anything. And then when she expressed how she felt about it you told her to get over it. And you don't think that you were being an asshole with that? You have inevitably changed the dynamic between you and your daughter, and your daughter and your son (especially if she knows her bro knew about the always be theirs for vacation thing because it looks like he swooped in and pulled this out from underneath her.) Whether you knew about the promise or not, how did you think this wasn't going to look at the minimum like favoritism toward one of your children over the other to give them a property that was supposed to be family property and where you go to celebrate the life of her late father.  She had the \"nerve\" to tell you that she felt robbed by you because that's essentially what happened. You robbed her of a vacation home, your robbed he of a place to go to celebrate her father, and the place that she could go to reflect/ remember her father. Enjoy your relationship with your son and new daughter in law, because you're probably not going to have much of one with your daughter", "YTA. How on earth did you manage to sell that house and never once think \"oh hey, I bet daughter would like to know about this.\" Do you just hate her or something? It really seems like you hate her. \nAlso you and your husband both suck for not having wills that CLEARLY stipulate your division of assets. Seriously, that's stupid and would have solved this problem before it even started.", "YTA\n\nYou have two kids, shouldn't both of them have had the ability to bid on the house?\n\nClearly playing favorites with \"She had the nerve to tell me..\".", "Legally it's yours.\n\nThose with integrity, ethics, morals, intelligence, compassion, empathy, and loyalty to family will disagree with your choice to Refuse your daughter her right to the house as your husband indicated.\nIf your goal was to damage your relationship with your daughter & drive her away, congratulations,  you've succeeded.

Good luck  getting your daughter  to even remotely respect you again..", "YTA. You should have spoken to both of them.", "yta - in that you didnt bother calling your daughter to let her know u were selling the house to your son.  it must have been a real shock finding out that way.", "YTA for the way that you handled it. It\u2019s a place of great sentimental value that her dad loved, so she loved it, and you didn\u2019t include her or even at the very least TELL her what was going on. Then when she was upset and saddened to hear that she can no longer take trips to the house her dad loved whenever she wants, you told her \u2018get over it\u2019. Obviously you can do what you want with the house but the way you went about it completely left her out, of course she feels hurt.", "YTA this should have been discussed with your daughter.", "YTA\n\nOP is showing clear favoritism for her son...I wonder if this is the only instance or if this is a reoccurring theme", "YTA. Just a question, has your son always been your favorite child?  How could you think that you shouldn't have had a conversation with your daughter before you did this?  Are you going to give the house you live in to your daughter after your passing?", "YTA - I get the feeling that you aren\u2019t that close to your children.  There is no way you could have thought that any one child would be okay with the other being given first dibs to by the family vacation home without having a conversation about it.", "YTA and a liar to say you don\u2019t have a very clear favorite.  Terrible mother to your daughter", "YTA. To her it was the family home. You should at least talked to her about it. \n\nWhat is mine is mine attitude is really horrible. She's your daughter not some stranger. You showed how you favoured and that you don't care about her. That's why she blocked you.", "You and your son - both YTA.

You practically excluded her from the family. I would go NC with you too.", "YTA. For the way you communicated it to her. For how you left her out of the decision process. For disrespecting her role in the family. Your husband left everything to you with the assumption that you could be trusted to take care of the whole family.

What do you think about that?\" -- common courtesy.\n\nYTA.", "YTA. \n\nI call my mom every week on the phone and we talk about everything from life-changing decisions to how should I wash my nice cashmere socks.\n\nIf your relationship with your daughter is so distant that you don't tell her that you're selling your house, you fucked up there.\n\nYou probably ruined your relationship with your daughter, but you clearly don't give a fuck about her anyway so it doesn't even matter.", "The lack of communication in this family seems weird.  Kids lose their father, mom doesn't know about family promises, parents had separate savings accounts, son doesn't tell sister he bought the house, or even intended to do so, dad didn't specify anything in a will?  But she knows son and fiance will have a prenup?  Is this a step family?

I mean how do you never bring the sale of the house it's not like it took 2 days to make the sale, do either you hardly talk to your daughter ( so why does it bother you she blocked you surprised you noticed) or think so little of your daughter to mention that your selling a home that holds many memories for her and the dad she lost, the it's still in the family is BS, if your son home so he may rightfully not want to host vacations there it has changed the home.

And BS that you didn't know what her dad told her, that kind of thing is pretty clear when all the family enjoys a property like that.", "YTA, you're not a parent of one child, you're a parent of TWO! Of course, your husband would want both of them to enjoy the house. Why would he leave it to one kid? Of course, he's going to leave it to you to make it fair. It's not that hard to understand. It's all about fairness and you messed up.", "YTA. \n\nGood for your daughter blocking your number. I mean, what are you possibly calling her for now? You should have called before, even if just to let her know you were selling the house. Even if she didn't want it (I assume after reading your replies about her loving the city and all that stuff) the point here is that you made a huge decision concerning a place that was important to her as well and she just knew about it because she asked about the yearly visit. Not because you told her. \n\nSo, if she hadn't asked? You wouldn't have informed her about the sell? \n\nKind of disgusting how you evidently favor your son over your daughter. It's not her fault that she doesn't look/act like her dad.", "NTA\nFor selling it!

What kind of relationship do you have?", "I would be so so upset at my parent if he withheld this information for however long it takes to sell a house (which I understand can be a lengthy process). It would make me feel unimportant, disregarded; it would make me feel sad to lose out on the future family vacation memories and the tradition of celebrating life. I would also probably feel like that information was deliberately kept from me, cause it\u2019s kind of big news so why else wouldn\u2019t it have been shared? \n\nSo while you\u2019re not TA for selling your house, YTA for not even thinking to MENTION it to your daughter before the sale was finalized.

Yeah, sure, legally you can do whatever you want with the house - it's your property. But it's WEIRD that it seems like it never even occurred to you to tell her that you'd sold it to her brother, and that you didn't mention it until she brought it up in another context. You know this would be upsetting to her, and reading between the lines it sounds like you heavily favor her brother over her.", "YTA, why do you treat your daughet this way? It's kind of wild that you would make such a big decision, and one that has significant impact on her life without mentioning it first.  Just because you are in the right legally, in now way justifies your behaviour.  Please don't forget that being an AH is rarely illegal, so stop leaning into that.  I feel for you daugheter, losing a father and having a mother that could care less about her feelings and needs.", "YTA when you are obviously playing favourites with your kids.

We got an argument and didn\u2019t talk for a few weeks. In the meantime, she agreed to sell the family home to my brother who is not my father\u2019s child and did not grow up in the house.

Now she needs to asks her brother to access a home that she considered apart of the whole family\u2019s. What happens when he has children, or him and the wife are fighting? Or if they divorce?

I've been through similar things with money/asset inheritance, and family members can become horrendous when they feel they didn't get what they deserved or are 'owed'.\n\nI don't think you should let it ruin your relationship and should do what you can to fix it, but you can only bend so far in situations like this. I'm curious what your son has to say to your daughter about this situation.", "Nta", "NTA so your daughter expected you to continue to pay for a house so that she could use it as a vacation home a few times a year?  That is entitlement right there.", "NTA.  I'm sorry, but it was your home to do as you wish, and you sold it to him at FAIR MARKET PRICE, it's not like you gave it to him. Also, as indicated, this way it still stays in the family.\n\nDaughter is acting entitled to something that does not belong to her.  I understand her being upset, but at the same time she should be happy her brother bought it and that it will always remain in their \"family\"", "NTA. can't imagine the hate here....good luck with your daughter.", "NTA.  The house was yours to do with as you wished.  Neither your son nor your daughter had any claim to it. It was not your daughter's house, too, as she seemed to think.  I am weary of kids thinking they have ANY claim to what their parents have accumulated.  If you get left an inheritance, that's a nice bonus, but it's certainly not anyone's \"right.\"\n\nThis woman might very well have sold the house to the daughter if she had shown any interest in buying it.  We have no way knowing.  But if she had, Theo would have no right to think it his house, too.\n\nI'm also weary of kids thinking if one kid gets something, they have the right to the same thing.  That is not how life works.  My brother and I bought our first cars with our own money but when my sister was old enough to drive, my parents gave her their second car.  Did I think that was fair? Maybe not but I spent exactly zero time fuming about it.  That's life.\n\nIt would have been better if you had discussed it with both kids, but it's done now.

He bought it from you. This has absolutely no effect on any potential inheritance.\n\nIn fact, it makes inheriting anything from you even easier, as you'd have more in liquid assets to pass down, meaning less of a hassle dealing with it.", "NTA.

It's odd that he would leave items to family and friends and not mention something as big as a house. If the house belonged to both of you, why would he make a promise without discussing it with you?\n\nHopefully this blows over and she can see that you did nothing to hurt her purposely. I can understand her being shocked and hurt over the sudden change. She may feel it should have been discussed with her before you sold it.\n\nI don't see where you did anything unforgivable here. It is your house. No one has a say over your property while you are living. I have a home. My daughter will inherit it if I die. Until then I can sell it, rent it, bulldoze it. She knows this.", "Absolutely NTA. Everyone else saying to the contrary is making massive assumptions about what is going on.\n\nI assume (a) that you sold it to your son within the margin of fair market value, and (b) that you know your 26 year old daughter is not in a position to have made an offer on the house herself. If both these reasonable assumptions hold (and it\u2019s reasonable to assume you know the latter one holds) then \\*perhaps\\* you might have mentioned the sale to your daughter earlier on, but you were under no obligation to do so. If they don\u2019t hold, then there is an argument you favoured your son over your daughter, so you might be TA, depending on the circumstances.\n\nSuppose you received a generous offer on the house from a stranger. You don\u2019t need your daughter\u2019s approval to sell it, or even need to tell her that you are considering the offer. Yes, your family uses it, but that tradition doesn\u2019t give any of them a right to decide whether to sell it or not. It\u2019s yours. The children already received their share of the inheritance from their father. Meaningfulness does not amount to a property right, or even a right to consultation.\n\nSuppose your son wanted to buy your car. You don\u2018t need to tell your daughter about the offer, even if she has many fond memories of trips you\u2019ve taken in it. This is just a property transaction with respect to which she is a third party, albeit one who is indirectly affected.\n\nThe promise from your husband to your daughter is irrelevant. That promise does not bind you unless it was stipulated, either legally or morally, as a condition of your inheriting the house (which you say it wasn\u2019t). Moreover, as your son now owns the house, there is still the possibility of the yearly tradition continuing.\n\nSome of the other commenters say you were within your rights to sell it to him (without consulting her) but it was still an asshole move. \\[Incidentally, this is a possibility that AITA commenters often overlook\u2014i.e., the asshole-within-rights.\\] But we don\u2019t generally say that we need to consult our family members before disposing of our property, even if they might be affected by the decisions we make. \n\nYour daughter seems to be assuming that you were under some sort of obligation not to sell the lake house at all, just so that your family gets to spend time there every year. Now, that\u2018s a very nice thing that you all do, and it would be mean to just stop it. But she is asking you to forgo the amount you received from the sale just so that she gets to continue the tradition in the way that is preferable to her. No one has standing to demand that their family members forgo an entire house worth of capital just so that they get to continue doing something they like.\n\nSuppose you are richer than Croesus and your only motivation in selling the house to your son was not the money you receive from the sale, but to help him and his fianc\u00e9e get started. Even then, NTA. Your daughter should be happy that you\u2019re the kind of parent who does things for her children, and should look forward to similar benevolence when/if she gets married, or starts a company, etc.\n\nDid you hide the transaction from your daughter because you felt bad about it? Not telling someone about a transaction is not hiding it from them. (If you did take steps to hide it from her, that is a different story, but even that might be understandable if you knew how she would react.) Moreover, you may well have had good reason not to bring her into the loop beforehand precisely because large financial decisions should not be weighted by the emotional burdens or guilt trips that others place on us. If you had consulted her, and she reacted negatively, then going ahead with the transaction in the face of her opposition may have come across to her as even more disrespectful and hence even more difficult for you to navigate.\n\nYou\u2019ve received a large sum from your son from the sale. You can spend that money as you see fit. When you pass on, presumably your son and daughter will share that money 50/50, more or less. So she will benefit from the sale in the long run. Perhaps she would rather have received a 50% share of the house when you pass away, but so what? We don\u2019t get to demand that the things in the world to which we are sentimentally attached always get to be ours. \n\nI suspect that what is really going on here is that your daughter is still grieving your husband and is interpreting you selling the house as you moving on from your own grief. She\u2019s angry because she may not be ready for you not to be oriented towards the past and your life with your husband raising your children. If so, I would have a conversation with her, when you can, about that point, and look for ways you can all continue with commemorating your husband in ways that do not impose massive emotional obstacles to moving on with what you need to do in your own lives, or that involve giving people vetoes over each other\u2019s decisions.", "NTA, let\u2019s say you did call her and she said no, can the son just not buy the house? You sold it at market price because he wanted it. They both got what there father left them your son wanted the house, he bought the house nothing wrong with that.

Then, as my husband loved to fish, we saved money again to buy a house in a lake near our city. We have two kids Theo (m29) and Lindsey (f26). We used to have family vacations in the lake house quite often as it wasn't that far. \n\nThe house was under my husband's name. My husband got sick five years ago with a terrible illness, he fought all he could but he ended up passing away a year after his diagnosis. As a way to be precautions he passed the properties to me and also the money he had saved up (we had separate savings accounts). He never told me what to do with the money or anything, he just passed all out to me with the help of a lawyer. He also wrote a will for some of his beloved items (his grandfather's car as example) things that weren't expensive but had a emotional value. He left some stuff for me, some for our kids and the rest of his family and friends. After his parting we started a yearly tradition to go there in his birthday to remember him. \n\nAround like 8-9 months ago my son came up to me and asked me what plans did I had for the house, he explained that he wanted to buy a house before his marriage and would love to buy the lake house. I told him I needed to think about it, but then I agreed. My son reminds me of my husband a lot, he loves nature as much as his dad did and he loves that house too, so I knew that it would be in great hands. We did it all legally and the house was sold market price range. My son and his fiance plan to move soon.\n\nMy daughter came home to visit me the other day, she asked me if we were going to the lake house to celebrate my husband's birthday again this year. I told her that we should ask Theo but I'm sure that's not going to be a problem for him. She asked my should we ask him and I told that since it's his house now he gets to decide that kind of stuff. She went crazy when she found out Theo had brought the house. She had the nerve to tell that she feels robbed by me because that's her house too and I didn't asked her. I had to remind her that legally that house is mine, and that I had sell it to her brother, not just some stranger. We ended up having a big argument over this. She said I broke her dad's promise because he told them both that the house would always be theirs to go on vacations, it would never sell or something like that. I didn't knew that as he never told me so, he didn't gave me any instructions about the house. At last I told her to get over it and she left. She also blocked my number and I can't call her. \n\nI think she's overreacting, the house is her brother's home now, it's not like we lost it forever to some stranger. My son and his fiance will sign a prenup too, so in case of a divorce he won't lose the house. But also I understand that she feels heartbroken over that promise that I had no idea of.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

You could  have stipulated to your son to continue hosting the yearly tradition.", "YTA regardless of what your husband promised and legally it is your house the fact you agreed to this with your son and never even mentioned it to your daughter is horrible. I would have had the same reaction, it was a family home too, to both your children. You didn't even consider that your daughter may have wanted to buy it and completely blind sided her. Even if she decides to talk to you again you'll never have the same relationship again since she now knows where she stands with you.

You sold without discount, your son wanted to buy a house and would not be able to afford partial ownership of lake house and separate house. Big assumption here, but daughter is unlikely to be able to afford and so secrecy was to prevent fights prior to sell. Owning 2 houses is a lot even if you are fairly comfortable.

Same with her brother.  This should have been a family discussion.", "I agree. It's her decision, but she knew she was being shady by not telling the daughter.

Either she intentionally withheld information or she isn\u2019t that close to her daughter and doesn\u2019t talk much.", "Yeah, that's really what turns this into a YTA. You could have at least talked to her about it.", "Honestly, it would have taken ten minutes to just to call her and say heads up, this is what I'm going to do.

I\u2019m not sure there was malicious intent, she sold the house at market value, not gave it to him, but there WAS a lack of concern for the daughter in not telling her first.  We lack a lot of details.  It\u2019s entirely likely that the daughter isn\u2019t financially in a place to purchase the home; at 26 she could be just out of grad school/just starting out in her career.  The thought process that the mom would rather sell to family vs. strangers and possibly couldn\u2019t afford two house for the long haul is legit.  The issue is not socializing the idea first.  \n\nWe also don\u2019t know how entitled the daughter is.  Realistically, if she couldn\u2019t afford to buy it herself and the mom needs the money/lack of expense, would she have been screaming that mom needs to sacrifice to keep the house so she can have it?  It isn\u2019t clear if the daughter has any more care for her mother than the mom does for her daughter.\n\nI also think the assumption that the son was trying to be slick isn\u2019t a given.  He could have seen that she wouldn\u2019t be able to hold onto it long term, known he couldn\u2019t afford two houses, and tried to find a solution that could be workable.", "Yeah, this family has a weird dynamic.  Why on earth didn\u2019t SOMEONE clue the daughter in?  She must feel so left out and betrayed.", "Bro she lied by omission lmao she\u2019s clearly TA, i dont even know how u could sit there and type this out and feel like ur justified enough to say this.
