She was in possession of her husband\u2019s ashes, who predeceased her by many years and youngest daughter\u2019s, who passed away 2 years ago. \n\nFor the last 15 or so years her oldest daughter (I\u2019ll call Becky) and Becky\u2019s younger brother have made it clear verbally and via text that they wanted no contact whatsoever with their mom or their sister who was disabled and lived with their mom.\n\nFast forward to their mother\u2019s death. The estate was left to me, along with very clear legal instructions that her kids were not to receive anything. We had spoken of her wishes many times and I had promised to respect them with the exception of the family photos which I thought her kids should have.\n\nI set aside the photos as well as sentimental items that had belonged to their father. I texted Becky\u2019s husband and let him know I had boxed these items and would include their father\u2019s ashes and half of their mother and sister\u2019s. He texted back that Becky wanted the father\u2019s ashes but did not want her mother or sister\u2019s ashes. I replied that her mother\u2019s wish was that her, her husband and their daughter\u2019s ashes be scattered \u201cnice places\u201d together, so I would keep the dad\u2019s ashes and scatter them all. Their attitude immediately changed and he said they would accept all the ashes. Throughout these texts Becky\u2019s husband spelled the mom and sister\u2019s name wrong 5 times collectively, each time a little differently. I felt it was a show of disdain and was worried they would just throw the unwanted ashes away.   \n\nI was hurt and angry, but did not want further contact or conflict, so I mixed the ashes of all 3, re filled the father\u2019s urn with the mix and sent it with no mention of the mom or sister. My children and I spread the remaining ashes of their \u201cgrandma\u201d and \u201caunt\u201d who they adored, mixed with her husband who they are too young to remember. \n\nIt\u2019s been over a year and I am perfectly at peace with this, but spreading the ashes came up in conversation recently with an extended family member, which led to a short explanation. They were shocked. They thought not only was mixing the ashes \u201cgross\u201d but that I should have made Becky aware of what I had done as she might share what she thought was just her dad\u2019s ashes with her older (60s-70s) half siblings who have the same father. They also had no contact with their step mom or disabled half sister for many years. \n\nI don\u2019t really care about these people, nor do I think I owe them this information.

Not for mixing ashes, but **for revealing that** to another extended family member.  Now they are also involved in your lie of omission about this.\n\nYou *unburdened yourself* of the secret, probably to get affirmation that you had done the right thing.  You should have kept this information to yourself, period.", "People saying yta and disrespecting the ashes.... if these people hated each other.. sure.. maybe I understand that. But it sounds like they're a family that gets to be together again.\n\nWhen I read the headline I thought yeah yta but after reading I think your nta but you should have kept this information to yourself. \n\nBut I also don't understand why you didnt just send half of the dad's ashes?", "OMG what part of \"ashes\" are people not getting? NTA, you did what you thought was best to respect her wishes. The family distributing ashes of other people mixed doesn't and shouldn't change a thing because...they are ashes.", "NTA-it was the mothers wishes end of story.....the people voting YTA cant read i guess.", "Good for you. NTA -", "NTA. You don't owe these people anything. And yes, they likely would've tossed the mother's and daugher's ashes.\n\nWhat you should've done is kept some of the father's ashes to mix w/the ashes you already had; that way you could've scattered them at the places she liked (which these folks won't do). But too late for that now.\n\nIt was a mistake to tell someone though, esp a family member, as word might get back to the other relatives.", "NTA.\n\nThe wishes of the deceased were to have their symbolic remains spread together. Ultimately, that's exactly what you did.\n\nYou probably shouldn't have mentioned anything to anyone, you'll get overreactions (as you might see here).", "Info: why was they no contact with their mother?", "If your friend wanted them mixed up, no problem. Sitting on the fence whether it was disrespectful towards the ashes or not. Would I want mine mixed up with others? No, if I was cremated. Rather have my own plot by myself too. Sounds like your friend didn\u2019t mix her husband\u2019s with her daughter\u2019s so think what you did she wouldn\u2019t have approved. Keeping some of his ashes and sending them the rest makes more respectful sense. And you wouldn\u2019t be obligated to share that. Or just kept some and sent off the bulk. You just decided to assure they did get some of the mom and daughters for spite. If that brings you peace, well\u2026", "NTA, but you definitely should have kept your mouth shut about it.", "Ive never heard of anyone mixing ashes like this. I'm a bit on the fence. \n\nUsually you keep the individual ashes and spread them at a location together. \n\nAlthough the idea of keeping the family together is the only thing that's making me lead to not think so terribly if this. \n\nFamily gets weird after people die. Everyone has their own feelings. I'm dealing with it recently. \n\nSoo I'm gonna say distance yourself. What's done is done. Maybe people will see it differently later on. You can still spread the family together if they so choose. Or they can set up a shrine with their pictures next to it and have the one urn. \n\nBut yeah, don't mix ashes again...unless discussed before death. It comes off as disrespectful to the dead.", " INFO: In the beginning your calling her their mother. At the end your said their step-mother. Is this their step-mother or their mother?", "I think that you would have been far better to have kept back some of father's ashes and scattered them and your friend's ashes, and those of her daughter , yourself.  \n\nIt sounds as though Becky had not actually asked for her dad's ashes so you could have voided the whole thing and just provided the family photos and mementos.\n\nIf she did ask for the ashes, then the appropriate way to deal would have been to say that you felt it was importnat to respect your friends wishes that they be scattered together, but that you were happy to divide their father's ashes to let them have a portion to scattered or retain as they wished. \n\nThat way, you could have given the their fathers ashes while still respecting Becky's wishes.\n\nI also think that gossiping about what you did to your family was an AH move. Once you start sharing the information, you don't have any control over it and it is entirely likely that it will eventually reach the ears of family members. Having decided to mix up the ashes and lie to Becky about it, you should as a bare minimum have kept your mouth shut so that there was no risk of that information getting out, and causing distress. \n\nDead people are beyond being hurt, living ones are not. Even if you didn't like Becky or her brother (and bear in mind, you only know one side of the story)  you had no right to lie to them.", "[removed]", "NTA.  She wanted her ashes to be spread.  You fulfilled that wish.", "YTA\n\nYou disrespected these peoples remains.\n\nYou also lied to not get involved and now other people also have to deal with your lie\n\nYou didn't respect the wishes of the daughter  who has her own reasons for no contact and you explicitly went against that.", "NTA - you made the best of a bad situation and honored your friend as best as you were able.", "Sentimental items (including belongings, photos, ashes, etc.) are for the people who are still living. I understand that their wishes conflicted with those of your deceased friend, but that gave you no right to violate their boundaries and trick them.\n\nDid you ask if they would allow you to keep a small amount of the father\u2019s ashes so you could carry out your friend\u2019s wishes? \n\nYTA and if you didn\u2019t try to work out a compromise, then you are even more so. The family member who you disclosed this to has every right to be appalled by you slighting your friend\u2019s children.", "\\`YTA", "Yta bc you did it out of spite.  If you wanted to scatter their ashes together, then keep half and give them half.", "Hard YTA. You suck big time", "Slight YTA, this was a thing you should have kept secret.", "Yta, why would you tell anyone? At the end of the day learn to keep a secret, as her family I would be pissed at you. You clearly knew it was wrong hence why you didn\u2019t tell her personally", "YTA, wtf is wrong with you?", "YTA. I don't care about mixing ashes, but you completely shat on the wishes of a stranger to not have the ashes of her mother and sister. Their reasons for not wanting that are their own and you had no business getting involved in that and going against their wishes.", "YTA you\u2019re disgusting", "YTA, you don\u2019t get to play god and take control of situations like this because of what you think is best, you aren\u2019t the only person mourning. You should respect the wishes of others as well, you don\u2019t know what they intended to do and it\u2019s not really your place. If you wanted to spread the ashes yourself you should have just kept them and said nothing and spread the ashes instead of tricking someone else into doing it.", "YTA", "I'm sorry for your loss. YTA. You are in no position to make any of these decisions or be hurt or angry because they misspell names or have internal drama. You could have scattered the unwanted ashes with a part of the wanted ashes, and given them the rest of what they wanted. It comes off as you taking revenge for your friend by doing what you know the remaining family wouldn't want at all. You were trusted with dealing with this and you went your own way basically because as you say, you don't care about these people. \n\nAlso, I may be alone in this way of thinking but I don't think honoring the dead's wishes matters nor can be used as an argument here. Once they are gone, all that matters is how the remaining family chooses to cope. In most countries, they wouldn't get a say in how their body is handled post-mortem whether they left a will or not.\n\nAgain, I'm sorry for your loss and that you had to deal with this. But YTA, big time.", "The dad had other kids who were the half siblings of these people? Like damn yes YTA", "YTA holy shit", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

At least, I would not recognize my own kids as having a right to separate my remains from my husband's, after I'd specifically said our remains were to be together.\n\nBut she should not have said anything.
