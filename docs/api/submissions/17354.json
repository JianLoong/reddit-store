I\u2019m 64 yo.\n\nA new film arrives, and I\u2019m all over it.  A 45 minute drive to the next town over, and I get to the theater early.  Because of my height, I go to the back row.  Especially in a full theater, the last place I want to sit is in a middle row, or way off to the side.\n\nThe back row is setup with seven pairs of twin seats, each separated by a 5\u2019 gap so that someone can park a stroller or wheelchair between them.\n\nI\u2019m all set in the middle pair of seats with no one behind me I might block.  The movie starts, but then 35 minutes into it an older woman comes in pushing her husband in a wheelchair into the full theater and settles into one of the spaces on either side of me.\n\nShe whispers to her husband and I hear him say, \u201cI\u2019m fine, just go find a seat.\u201d  At that point she turns to me and says, \u201cExcuse me, I need your seat.\u201d  He quickly says \u201cI don\u2019t need anything and we\u2019re late, just find another seat.\u201d  Nope, she wants my seat.  \u201cMy husband is an invalid!  I need to care for him, now please move!\u201d  This she says even louder.  All I could say was, \u201cSorry, I need to sit back here because of my height.  And, I don\u2019t think there ARE any other seats!  Really, you should come back for the next showing.\u201d  Now people are glaring at us.\n\nThis goes on, with her husband telling her he can sit by himself and doesn\u2019t need her by him, to me refusing to move, to her getting more demanding.\n\nShe leaves and comes back with a theater worker, who says he has a seat for me in the very first row to the far left.  There\u2019s no way I can see from there and I tell him that.  He doesn\u2019t want to deal with it, and says with a shrug, \u201cWell, they need to sit here.\u201d   I said, no, she doesn\u2019t _need_ to sit here, he does, and is.  She can sit anywhere.  At that she chimed in:  \u201cI\u2019m not going to sit all the way down there!\u201d  Entitled much?  Sorry, not moving.\n\nShe then goes to each of the other people in the back row, starting with the middle pairs of seats demanding their seats.  She finally guilts a high school kid into giving up his seat. \n\nThe kid makes his way down there to not enjoy his now ruined film, while the old woman triumphantly takes over his seat, nearly 40\u2019 away from where her husband is sitting.  \n\nAfter the lady comes to get her husband, she calls me a \u201crude bastard with no manners!\u201d for not giving up my seat so \u201cI could have sat next to my husband!\u201d  I suggested that next time they get to the theater on time, so got a parting \u201cfuck you!\u201d from the old gal while her husband stared at his feet.\n\nSo, AITA?  Should I have given up the movie, the $30+ spent, the 90 minutes driving for nothing, so as not to be a \u201crude bastard?\u201d I couldn\u2019t see a later showing.

As a shorter person I really appreciate your move to sit in the back.\n\nNow, as for giving up your seat. Early bird gets the worm. They should show up a bit earlier next time if possible.

This is why I only do theaters with assigned seats so I can make sure that me and a companion have spots since we can't sit just any where.  Stop automatically going for the wheelchair companion/ or other handicap seats.  I think I'd be less critical if you were running late and the theater was packed instead of picking them when you were early.  Yes, they were later.  Maybe they are bad with time management or maybe they were later because it can be hard to do things quickly when one person is disabled.  But again you didn't end up there out of desperation.  You deliberately picked the only row that people like me can use if we want to sit with others whom we may even be sharing food or drink with.

Glad ya stood your ground!", "I only do reserve seating so I can know if I have the correct spots or not.   But I still think able bodied people should only take them as a last resort or sit fto the ends out.  Because most of the time the wheelchair spots are within the inside of the rows. I think it's entitled of people who don't need those spots to gravitate to them when they have other choices.  A lot of the time I only have three seats to chose between even if I'm the first person to pick a seat.   How many do you? Think about that.  And start actually encouraging others to only take them when a theater is actually full and not early.  Or to go from the edges towards the middle.  My complaints have been directed only at taking them in the first place before its reasonable to assume they won't be needed.  I'm fighting back against that mentality.  Not the refusal to move after a movie Gas begun if it did indeed already start.  I'm fighting back because it sounds like he first got seated when it was mostly empty.  Even if the couple arrived when the theater was half full, they may have still not been able to have seats together.  That's what I'm arguing about.   But whatever.  At least I have multiple theaters with assigned seating and cheap Tuesdays.  I can avoid assholes and pay a lot less doing so.", "I see your point, but there is no extra wide spaces of the last row to sit between, only seats in pairs with 5\u2019 of blank floor between them.  And if the space were marked for disabled people I never would have sat there.  There was room for 8 wheelchairs.  If there had been any other seat remotely workable I would have sat there, but all the seats were full.  I can only imagine the groans if I moved down even a couple of rows.  I\u2019m 310 lbs as well as tall, and I effectively block anyone from seeing past me with my back and shoulders.  I had two options, leave or stay.  To me it\u2019s the same as what would you do if the theater was full and a non-disabled person came in and demanded your seat?", "And I would, if it were something like a social get-together or something that only happened once. A movie that's selling out entire theaters? Nope. I guarantee there's another showing they were slightly early to, so they could have gotten in before the theater was full and gotten the seats they wanted.\n\nETA: Also, the *movie* had been going for a half-hour. That means they were at least an hour late to something that only lasts for 2-3 hours, because the ads and trailers don't start until the movie start time, and that's at least 20b minutes right there.", "Sit on the far end then.  Not a middle one.  Most of the  rows I have seen don't have enough room for a chair next to the end space.  I'll use A for able bodied  and W for empty space.

But it\u2019s inconceivable that 8 wheelchairs would be there simultaneously.  I\u2019ve only ever seen one at a time, and that very seldom.  For a first run popular movie they aren\u2019t going to keep 14 seats vacant.  They expect people to adapt as needed.  The only way your scenario would work is to keep the entire back row reserved for handicapped / disabled folks, and not even allow couples with baby strollers to use the spaces.\n\nAs to the refund, I think they probably would have agreed to let me see the next showing if I had asked (and if I could have made it) but I\u2019m doubtful on the $20 worth of concession stuff.   And I\u2019d have been much more open to just skipping the whole thing and calling it a busted day if all this had happened before the movie started while seats were getting sorted out.", "Because of my height I will always choose seating in the back row, which by design of the theater will be adjacent to a wide area for baby strollers or wheelchairs.  There will always be a space for a wheelchair, but not always for the companions to the person in the chair IF the theater was really packed as in this case.  For instance if the person in the chair came with several people some of them would have to sit in another row.", "Mate if the other couple didn't get there on time or plan accordingly then it's no-ones fault but their own. You can't ask someone to move after you've turned up half an hour late. NTA.", "Yeah, I didn\u2019t clearly understand the seating situation from the other post/s I saw. Does that mean that those seats were less likely to be obstructed by a tall person sitting in the row in front?\n\nLike I said, you\u2019re not TA here - ultimately the lady was a jerk and the usher is being paid to resolve these things, so it\u2019s not on you.", "I went with everyone sucks here because it did seem like they were extra late but it seemed like op was pretty early and deliberately picked that row.   I'm trying to argue that that should only be last resort seating.  I've made that clear abundantly.  I'm only arguing because so many of you think that section should  be treated just the same as any others.  If the nta votes were just because the couple was extremely late but had caveats of to try to avoid that seating,  we'd be in agreement.   I do think after a movie has begun is rude.  But I also think it's rude for people to gravitate to that section early and it seems like he did sit in the middle of it early on.  \nBut I don't ask. I also don't do theaters without assigned seats and if they are taken already, i abandon the purchase.  But I have sometimes seen it when a lot of the companions are taken without the wheelchairs being taken even when there are more options available.  That's probably why I lean more esh and why I have been arguing more.

Is there a wide enough gap for a wheelchair on either side of the end seats? If not, please just choose those over the middle.  \nMore theaters should just get assigned seats so we all know what to expect when we are purchasing.  I'm glad all the nice ones near me have it.  Maybe even the not as nice one.  Haven't been to that one since 2019.  \nI also don't really understand coming in after a movie has started so we agree there.

You\u2019re assuming this theater is the same as yours and calling me an asshole.  More couples with strollers sit in the back row than people in wheelchairs.  There was perfect accommodation for the man in the wheelchair.  What there wasn\u2019t accommodation for was her getting to sit by him.  As it was she sat 40 feet away and he was fine.  The theater setup the floor there this way, and I\u2019m not violating any rules by sitting in those seats to avoid ruining the movie for someone else by blocking their view.", "There is room for a stroller or chair on each side of all 7 pairs of seats.  It is statistically incredibly unlikely that all 8 wheelchair spaces would be taken.  If I\u2019m going to sit in the back then I will take the middle center, middle left, or middle right.  I\u2019ll even shift one more pair further left or right, to cover 10 chairs and 6 wide spaces.  I\u2019m not going to go to the extreme left or right and have a terrible view in the statistically incredibly remote chance that 5 wheelchair people will show up, each with two or more caregivers that absolutely must sit by them.

Disabled people aren't invalid. If he was bound to the wheelchair, police need to be called. Sounds like he was just using the wheelchair.\n\nEdit to add because apparently I was too subtle: \"Wheelchair user\" is the correct term, not \"wheelchair bound.\" If someone is literally bound to a wheelchair, that's a problem. https://newmobility.com/dont-say-wheelchair-bound/", "Perhaps a little less likely because they do give you more room, and there\u2019s more \u201cgaps\u201d in the back row of course, but with the right person in those double seats, say this older lady, if I sat in front of her she\u2019d be craning her neck and leaning to the side to see past me.  I wear a hat, so the first thing I do at the theater is remove my hat and move to the back row.  There\u2019s another theater a bit further away I go to sometimes that has tiered seats right against the highest back wall that actually recline, and the handicapped / stroller seating is all reserved down front so none of this is an issue. In that theater any seat in the back two rows actually works great to not block anyone\u2019s view.  Very well designed layout.", "Good question, and yes they have spaces on both sides of all the back pairs of double seats.  I talked to the theater manager and he said that they are getting software so you can pick your seat when you buy your ticket, which will be cool.  They\u2019ll have a theater schematic to choose from on an iPad.  I have a favorite seat in mind, and ideally that won\u2019t be an issue with so many other designated wheelchair / stroller spaces available.  I guess you\u2019ll be able to do it online as well, but I always like to get a paper ticket because I keep the stubs.  I threw them out for years, only keeping some, which I regret.  I like going back through my pile and finding stubs for older films.  For instance I was there on opening day 46 years ago this month (in 10 days actually) at the Coronet in San Francisco for the Star Wars premier, which was a blast.  (There\u2019s a pic of me waiting in line somewhere in the SF Chronicle archives, with hair down to my shoulders.  \ud83e\udd13.

She ruined the movie for you, the kid that did move, probably her husband, and anyone unlucky enough to be sitting near the two of you.", "I sort of think everyone here needs a look in the mirror, starting with the cinema itself. In my part of the world, the seats are also set up like this except that row is blocked and cannot be booked unless in consultation with the cinema in person. What\u2019s more every seat is allocated at purchase, so whether you get there first or last, you should sit in your purchased seat.  The fact that the cinema hasn\u2019t arranged this in the same way has created this issue to start with. I agree that sitting in an area designated for wheelchair support isn\u2019t cool - despite the protests that it\u2019s not exclusively for them. It\u2019s also BS that having apparently legitimately sat there the cinema would give you an option of a front row. And the woman demanding it after turning up late is hugely entitled, but it\u2019s probably worked every other time. You guys need Gold Class.", "NTA - I too am more \"mature\" but have had entitled elderly try to push me round too. I'm starting to think it's a power flex. I have mobility issues due to severe arthritis but my hair isn't completely white yet.

I was fuming as there was EXACTLY the same space in the opposite space but she sat next to me just to make me move. I wish I could have seen her face when I got off as I was having a bad day & struggling even with a stick.\n\nSome old people (as you get in any other age group) are entitled dicks who just enjoy making people move at their wish, even if there is another space easily available they could go to.", "NTA.

They were wrong not to intervene.", "You know, your comment is so obvious I don\u2019t know why I didn\u2019t think of it myself, great idea!

At the same time, if this woman were involved I\u2019d bet she\u2019d put her husband behind me, sit next to him then demand I move down front out of his way!  \ud83e\udd14\ud83d\ude33", "Yes, back rows become a habit, and another thing, many tall guys develop an unconscious stoop, poor posture that you\u2019re always fighting, because you\u2019re wary of banging your head on doorframes!

He just wanted to watch the film and was glad to do it alone.  And my impression was that it was a well used chair and he was in it all the time.
