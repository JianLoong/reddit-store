I\u2019m 64 yo.\n\nA new film arrives, and I\u2019m all over it.  A 45 minute drive to the next town over, and I get to the theater early.  Because of my height, I go to the back row.  Especially in a full theater, the last place I want to sit is in a middle row, or way off to the side.\n\nThe back row is setup with seven pairs of twin seats, each separated by a 5\u2019 gap so that someone can park a stroller or wheelchair between them.\n\nI\u2019m all set in the middle pair of seats with no one behind me I might block.  The movie starts, but then 35 minutes into it an older woman comes in pushing her husband in a wheelchair into the full theater and settles into one of the spaces on either side of me.\n\nShe whispers to her husband and I hear him say, \u201cI\u2019m fine, just go find a seat.\u201d  At that point she turns to me and says, \u201cExcuse me, I need your seat.\u201d  He quickly says \u201cI don\u2019t need anything and we\u2019re late, just find another seat.\u201d  Nope, she wants my seat.  \u201cMy husband is an invalid!  I need to care for him, now please move!\u201d  This she says even louder.  All I could say was, \u201cSorry, I need to sit back here because of my height.  And, I don\u2019t think there ARE any other seats!  Really, you should come back for the next showing.\u201d  Now people are glaring at us.\n\nThis goes on, with her husband telling her he can sit by himself and doesn\u2019t need her by him, to me refusing to move, to her getting more demanding.\n\nShe leaves and comes back with a theater worker, who says he has a seat for me in the very first row to the far left.  There\u2019s no way I can see from there and I tell him that.  He doesn\u2019t want to deal with it, and says with a shrug, \u201cWell, they need to sit here.\u201d   I said, no, she doesn\u2019t _need_ to sit here, he does, and is.  She can sit anywhere.  At that she chimed in:  \u201cI\u2019m not going to sit all the way down there!\u201d  Entitled much?  Sorry, not moving.\n\nShe then goes to each of the other people in the back row, starting with the middle pairs of seats demanding their seats.  She finally guilts a high school kid into giving up his seat. \n\nThe kid makes his way down there to not enjoy his now ruined film, while the old woman triumphantly takes over his seat, nearly 40\u2019 away from where her husband is sitting.  \n\nAfter the lady comes to get her husband, she calls me a \u201crude bastard with no manners!\u201d for not giving up my seat so \u201cI could have sat next to my husband!\u201d  I suggested that next time they get to the theater on time, so got a parting \u201cfuck you!\u201d from the old gal while her husband stared at his feet.\n\nSo, AITA?  Should I have given up the movie, the $30+ spent, the 90 minutes driving for nothing, so as not to be a \u201crude bastard?\u201d I couldn\u2019t see a later showing.

I can't imagine the struggle he goes through every day dealing with that awful woman!  That woman was definitely TA!", "NTA, you were not obligated to give your seat for her. She asked and you said no. End of story.", "NTA, first come, first served. Tbh, not to sound like a hater, but she knew well in advance that her and her husband would need a lil more time to get settled into the movie theatre, they should have planned their trip a lil better.", "NTA. As a shorter person I really appreciate your move to sit in the back.\n\nNow, as for giving up your seat. Early bird gets the worm. They should show up a bit earlier next time if possible.

You both are senior citizens.", "NTA.\n\nOP was right every step of the way.

What's she sticking around for after missing so many key plot points?", "NTA, you went out of the way to consider your height to not inconvenience other people in the theater, her husband said multiple times he was fine and could sit alone and she acted like a prick, probably just an entitled lady that takes advantage of the husband situation for any perks she can get playing the pity card", "The theatre shouldn't have let them in that far into a show.\n\nBut you are clearly sitting in a wheelchair companion seat. But you are very tall so it's good for you to sit at the back, and you are a senior citizen yourself. Just a bit of an unfortunate set up.", "I dunno, the seat immediately next to a wheel chair park, sort of implies that it\u2019s for someone looking after a person in a wheel chair. Lots of people in wheelchairs are independent, but many are not. Even if the guy was saying he was fine, it may have been appropriate to give up the seat.\n\nAll that said, the lady was an AH here. They were late and she was not respectful to you or the rest of the audience, then became abusive.\n\nI know you were being considerate in sitting at the back, and maybe I\u2019m getting the layout wrong, but the seat immediately next to a wheelchair park ought to be part and parcel of the accessibility seating and should also be reserved. I would consider avoiding using those seats in future if possible.\n\nThat said, assuming those seats aren\u2019t signed as such, I don\u2019t think you\u2019ve actually done anything wrong here under the circumstances. Maybe you could have asked the usher for a refund (including if your snacks) and come back another time as a gesture of goodwill, but you\u2019re not under any societal obligation to do so.\n\nNTA.", "INFO:\n\nSo you were sitting in two seats?

This is why I only do theaters with assigned seats so I can make sure that me and a companion have spots since we can't sit just any where.  Stop automatically going for the wheelchair companion/ or other handicap seats.  I think I'd be less critical if you were running late and the theater was packed instead of picking them when you were early.  Yes, they were later.  Maybe they are bad with time management or maybe they were later because it can be hard to do things quickly when one person is disabled.  But again you didn't end up there out of desperation.  You deliberately picked the only row that people like me can use if we want to sit with others whom we may even be sharing food or drink with.  Stop doing that.\n\nI think it might have been fine to refuse to move but just don't go there in the first place from now on.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

The seats are in pairs, you were in one seat of a pair, you\u2019re saying there was another person in the other seat of your pair right?

No excuses for her behaviour, but maybe they could use a break.\n\nA movie isn't something that only shows once, though. It's not some social event that you can only go to that day at that time. If the lady had a very good reason for not not making it to the movie on time, she and her husband could have seen the next showing or come back a different day. Heck, a movie that is literally selling out the theater is probably showing on multiple screens in that building. Instead, she decided to go into the theaterb showing the movie *that had already started* and ruin the experience for an entire theater of movie watchers by making noise and throwing a fit.", "There was a guy next to me to my right.  To his right was a 5\u2019 space for stroller or wheelchair.  To my left was an identical space.  That\u2019s where she parked his chair, then hit me up.  After I refused she went to her husbands left where there was a couple, and asked the guy to vacate, and he also declined.", "But they\u2019re not for your exclusive use. So be in time like everybody else so you can pick your chair. Don\u2019t bully someone out of the chair halfway trough the movie, disturbing a whole movie theater.

Also, my father is 6\u20199 and my brother 7\u20191, and if they were to ever sit in front of me at any point\u2026 I would be PISSED lol. You don\u2019t realize how big of a difference it makes until you\u2019re stuck behind someone that size. Not only would OP\u2019s movie (and neck) have been ruined from sitting front row, but if he had sat a row forward originally, people behind would have complained and his poor knees would have been aching by the end of it. He got there at an appropriate time to be able to secure a seat that would be comfortable for his physique.", "Sit on the outside edge, or maybe situated between the extra-wide spaces of the last row.

That doesn\u2019t entitle them to anything - I\u2019m just suggesting we have some empathy.", "Gotcha that makes sense. Glad ya stood your ground!", "I only do reserve seating so I can know if I have the correct spots or not.   But I still think able bodied people should only take them as a last resort or sit fto the ends out.  Because most of the time the wheelchair spots are within the inside of the rows. I think it's entitled of people who don't need those spots to gravitate to them when they have other choices.  A lot of the time I only have three seats to chose between even if I'm the first person to pick a seat.   How many do you? Think about that.  And start actually encouraging others to only take them when a theater is actually full and not early.  Or to go from the edges towards the middle.  My complaints have been directed only at taking them in the first place before its reasonable to assume they won't be needed.  I'm fighting back against that mentality.  Not the refusal to move after a movie Gas begun if it did indeed already start.  I'm fighting back because it sounds like he first got seated when it was mostly empty.  Even if the couple arrived when the theater was half full, they may have still not been able to have seats together.  That's what I'm arguing about.   But whatever.  At least I have multiple theaters with assigned seating and cheap Tuesdays.  I can avoid assholes and pay a lot less doing so.", "I see your point, but there is no extra wide spaces of the last row to sit between, only seats in pairs with 5\u2019 of blank floor between them.  And if the space were marked for disabled people I never would have sat there.  There was room for 8 wheelchairs.  If there had been any other seat remotely workable I would have sat there, but all the seats were full.  I can only imagine the groans if I moved down even a couple of rows.  I\u2019m 310 lbs as well as tall, and I effectively block anyone from seeing past me with my back and shoulders.  I had two options, leave or stay.  To me it\u2019s the same as what would you do if the theater was full and a non-disabled person came in and demanded your seat?", "And I would, if it were something like a social get-together or something that only happened once. A movie that's selling out entire theaters? Nope. I guarantee there's another showing they were slightly early to, so they could have gotten in before the theater was full and gotten the seats they wanted.\n\nETA: Also, the *movie* had been going for a half-hour. That means they were at least an hour late to something that only lasts for 2-3 hours, because the ads and trailers don't start until the movie start time, and that's at least 20b minutes right there.", "Sit on the far end then.  Not a middle one.  Most of the  rows I have seen don't have enough room for a chair next to the end space.  I'll use A for able bodied  and W for empty space.   AAWAAWAA tends to be what I encounter.  Now I will introduce wheelchair companion if I am with someone to illustrate how we tend to sit.  ACWCCWCA .  That's why an end would be a lot less likely for you to end up with a wheelchair next to you and someone wondering if you would move.", "OP said it\u2019s 45 minute drive to the next town, so I wouldn\u2019t be so sure it was some multiplex - and not all theatres have closed captioning or other accessibility features that might have been important for them. We actually don\u2019t know."]}
