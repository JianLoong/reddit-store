My father died when I was a baby and for most of my life, it has just been my mom and me. She met my now-stepfather a couple years ago and they got married last summer. \n\nIt has been a huge adjustment to have SF in our family. Mostly because as compared to my mom, he is extremely strict. He convinced my mom that I am spoiled, entitled and need his harsher discipline or else I am never going to make anything of myself. When it was just my mom and me, our home seemed like a warm and loving place but now it feels like a boot camp, which makes sense because SF is ex-military. However, it feels unfair because I am not a bad kid by any means.\n\nI have always gotten pretty much straight As. I do my homework without having to be told and always did whatever chores my mom assigned. I don't talk back or curse and at this point, am not interesting in dating like a lot of my friends are. I don't drink or do drugs and always follow my curfew.\n\nHowever, SF decided that is not good enough. He demands perfection at school, like 100% on everything or else I get grilled over why I made a mistake. He decided I was a bit chubby so now I have to get up for 5 am runs/boot camp workouts and have to have weekly weight checks (my mom participates in this too because she wanted to lose weight). One of the worst things was that he decided most of my clothes are \"inappropriate.\" I do not think they are, I don't wear anything revealing or skintight, but I did favor bright colors. SF decided I was being attention-seeking with my clothes and took away all my bright-colored stuff and replaced it with drab/neutral colors. Again my mom went along with this because he persuaded her that I just had no sense of what was appropriate from now growing up with a father.\n\nAnyway to bring us to the current dilemma, of course St. Patrick's Day is this Friday and everyone at school wears green (or gets pinched). I am not allowed to wear green anymore because of SF's rules. Some friends were talking about what they are going to wear and I mentioned I can't participate this year. So one friend gave me a green T-shirt and suggested I wear it under my black sweater.\n\nI had the T-shirt in my backpack but SF decided to search my backpack (he does random searches of all my stuff, I guess I was just hoping he wouldn't find the T-shirt). Of course he was furious and grounded me for a month. I tried to explain that I just wanted to participate in the tradition and that I was going to be wearing it under other clothes, so at most a small sliver of green would show, but this didn't fly. My mom agreed with the grounding and furthermore said she was incredibly disappointed in me because I have never broken rules and acted out before. I feel awful for disappointing her but also really do feel like the rule is stupid and pointless.\n\nSo, AITA for planning to wear a green T-shirt for St. Patrick's Day when I am not allowed to wear bright colors?", "created_utc": 1678813403, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11rbtkv/aita_for_defying_my_stepfathers_clothing_rules/", "score": 756, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Not with you; you're doing fine. But that controlling behavior from your stepfather is not normal, by any stretch of the imagination.", "NTA. But what your stepfather is doing sounds like child abuse to me. It's extremely controlling and far beyond what's normal or acceptable. For you two to get along better he has to change... A lot.", "NTA. Do you have any other adults you can talk to this about? I believe your stepfather behaviour counts as a form of abuse. It's not just being strict, its much more aggressive than that. Your mother is also failing you by blindly going along with this. She's reared you this far after all. But now she has to do what her husband says? Does he have other children? How exactly would he know how to raise a child than your mother thatbhad been doing just fine for years?", "This is abuse. I am so sorry you've been having to go through this. If you don't feel comfortable talking to your mom about how SD is making you feel, then you should talk to the school counselor or another trusted adult in your life and ask them will help you talk to your mom. \n\nMaybe take some time to write down how you feel about amount of control he is asserting on you and how i affects you negatively. Also think about how these rules have affected your relationship with your mom. \n\nUnfortunately, he's probably never going to change and it sounds like your mom doesn't plan on going against him. If you have family or close friends who might let you stay with them until you finish school, it would be worth reaching out and trying to find someone to advocate for you.", "Is there a teacher you can trust to talk about this?", "NTA. Oh dear he is very controlling and abusive. I feel so sorry that he\u2019s brainwashed your mom into thinking any of this is okay. If she\u2019s not too far gone, try and have a conversation about him and his rules. I\u2019m assuming he doesn\u2019t have any children of his own so I\u2019m not sure why he and your mom think his \u201cparenting style\u201d is any better than your mother\u2019s was\u2014sounds like you were doing great before he came along.", "NTA - I feel so sad for you for how much I recognize my own childhood in this post, except it was my bio dad. \n\nThis is not normal. This is not healthy. This is not okay.\n\nThe thing about someone like this is that you literally cannot win. There is no standard of excellence you could reach that will satisfy them. Imposing these rules is part of their mental illness and the bar of their approval cannot be reached because it will always be moved higher when you're about to reach it. \n\nIt took me a long time to realize how angry I was at my mom for standing by and watching the hell my father put me through. Just because she wasn't behaving like he was, she was complicit in the abuse because she did nothing to protect me, a child, from it and let me think it was all my fault.\n\nThis is not your fault and it isn't your job to make this right. Your mom may very well be going through something that is blinding her to the truth of what's going on, but you do not, and should not, need to help feed her delusion that this is okay in order to be a good daughter. \n\nYour most important task from right now until you are able to move out is to protect your own sanity and confidence. Everything your step father is doing is designed to wear you down until you don't have any self esteem or strength left and just follow his every demand without question. \n\nKeep a journal if you can guarantee he won't find it and write down that you aren't a bad person, you are in a bad situation, the things you do \"wrong\" in this house aren't objectively morally wrong. If you can't safely write it down, repeat it to yourself in your head as often as you can.\n\nYou're safest option is to keep the peace as best you can and move out as soon as you can.", "NTA, OP this goes way beyond you, wanting to wear green for St. Patrick\u2019s Day, your stepdad is clearly emotionally abusing you, if I were you, I would be preparing myself to leave right when I turn 18, you\u2019ve gone to your mom and tried to talk with her, but she has shown that she clearly is siding with your stepdad, this guy is too blindsided by his military ways he just doesn\u2019t see that he\u2019s emotionally abusing his stepdaughter, so yeah, be prepared to go NC once you hit 18.", "NTA, but start planning your departure.  Good grades and extracurricular activities will help you get into a good school.  He might try to control you by insisting you don\u2019t go to college, or you go to one that you can stay at home.  Get into the mindset now that you will have to pay for everything yourself because he will attempt to use money to control you.", "NTA, have you tried talking to your mom about this? Thats absolutely not how a child, regardless of age or behavior should be treated. Be weary tho, it might be that all you can do is keep your head down till you turn 18. When you get towards that age, if you have to maybe make a plan with your friends. Some of my brothers friends had to do the same, though i dont know their situations.", "What in the world?? You can't wear green (or other bright colors), and he searches your bag and then grounds you for a month for finding a green T-shirt? He sounds abusive and controlling as hell.\n\nNTA at all. Your mom is okay with this?? That's absolutely ridiculous, and I'm really sorry to hear it. Sadly, since you're a minor, you'll probably have to put up with his BS rules for now. My advice is to try to coast by until you're 18 and can move out. If your mom actively sides with him on all this crap, you might have to limit how much contact you have with her. That's really shitty, and I'm sorry for the loss of your father and the way your stepfather is acting.", "Wow you are 10000% NOT the AH here at all!! He sounds insane tbh \n\nNTA", "You're not allowed to wear green?! This is abuse. Some bizarre kind of abuse to he sure, but abuse all the same. NTA.", "NTA as soon as you can, get out of there and never look back.", "NTA. Also, that man sounds plainly abusive, and I am appaled that your mother lets him get away with it or dictate how you live.", "Obviously NTA this is not normal behavior and I see you've stated you're worried about possible repercussions by speaking out, but would you be able to have a conversation with your mom about how you feel without SF around? A lunch? Shopping trip? I think that's the best first step.", "Isn't this like textbook abuse?", "NTA\n\nThis is abusive behavior. I also had a strict military SF come into my life around the same time yours did. \n\n There was definitely an adjustment period and I did have to get used to a few more rules than my mom had. But my SF would NEVER have have tried to exert this much control over me and my mother would not have let him if he had tried.\n\nThis level of control is not okay. You can try having a conversation with your mother about it. If SF started with smaller rule changes and escalated, she may not fully realize how bad things have gotten. She may also be facing abusive levels of controlling too. Regardless, it's her job as a parent to protect you. If she isn't willing or able to change the situation, please please please talk to a trusted counselor, teacher, parent of a friend, someone who will have your back. It's not a bad idea to loop in an adult you trust even if your mother commits to change. \n\nThe unfortunate reality is that abuse can and often does escalate. I hope that all your mother and SF need is a serious dose of reality and some parenting lessons but your safety is the first priority. As awful as it may sound, it's better than a trusted adult knows about this before it can get to the level of physical abuse.", "NTA. TELL ANYONE WHO WILL LISTEN", "If \"defying an asinine prescription against green t-shirts\" is the worst example of \"breaking rules and acting out\" that your mother can come up with then you are a *saintly* child thus far.  Your stepdad is insanely controlling and your mother is awfully enabling of him.  NTA.  Do you have any other adults in your life... a teacher, a school counselor... who you can talk to about this stuff?", "NTA.  Your SF should not be discipling you at all.  He entered your family when you were too old to regard him as a parent.  Your mom is wrong to allow him to set rules for you, nevermind ones this extreme.\n\nI think you should talk to some adult you trust, maybe at school, and get the three of you into counseling or otherwise introduce an outside authority to help moderate the conditions you are subjected to by him.\n\nI am very sorry this is happening to you.", "NTA, but girl this is a form of abuse and you really need to talk to someone outside the home about this. Do you have grandparents who could get involved? Or teachers?", "NTA. But not much you can do about it. I\u2019d just follow the rules while he can see you anyway. And then leave when you\u2019re 18. The guy sounds like a nut job, but it\u2019s not abuse to be that strict..just bad parenting. I\u2019d find ways to be independent as soon as possible. You don\u2019t want to have to rely on him for tuition or anything else after 18. So work toward scholarships, etc. if you\u2019re planning for college.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

These restrictions he's putting on you are completely over the top, and the fact that your mother is siding with him over you, *her child*, is disgusting.", "The best advice I can give you is to remember two things:\n\n1. This is not normal.\n2. This is not your fault.\n\nThere is nothing you can do to make this right because this isn\u2019t about following rules or building character. It\u2019s about control. \n\nNo matter what you do or how you behave your stepfather will find fault or create new obstacles because your stepfather needs to feel in control. \n\nYou following every rule perfectly will still result in new rules, because the thrill is in \u201ccorrecting\u201d behavior.\n\nI\u2019m so sorry, but you are not in the position to deescalate this situation. You shouldn\u2019t have be dealing with this in the first place.\n\nAt 15 I would start looking into college plans *now* if you haven\u2019t already started. Expect to take out loans or pay yourself. Do not expect (or accept) any help from your mother or stepfather. Any money offered is going to come with conditions.\n\nRemember you are worthy, and good, and trust yourself. Trust that voice that says this isn\u2019t okay. Remind yourself that this isn\u2019t normal or usual.\n\nSpend as much time as you can with friends and other family. Don\u2019t give in to the constant barrage from your stepfather. You are worthy. You matter. You can, and should, shine. \n\nThe second this crosses the line into easily documented abuse tell a trusted adult. \n\nThe unfortunate thing is that your stepfather is likely hyper aware of what he can and can\u2019t get away with. This is ALL already abusive. It\u2019s just not the type where people legally can step in.\n\nYour best chance of helping your mother is to help yourself. It\u2019s going to be hard. It\u2019s not fair. And you deserve a better answer.\n\nThis is not normal. This is not your fault.", "You can't.  With a guy like that, nothing will ever be enough.  You, your mom, and any other woman is simply a lesser being bc you aren't a man.  \n\nGet good grades, go to a school for away from him and don't come back on breaks and summers.", "I'm wondering if your mom IS actually happy, or if she's just trying to convince herself that she is to make the best of this terrible situation she's gotten into. I think she's pretending to be happy because she wants to be, but isn't seeing the hell you're being subjected to.  \n\n\nAre you able to talk to your mom alone, like maybe over breakfast somewhere? Write down what you've said here, that your home used to feel like a warm, safe place and now it feels like punishment to come home. If your mom isn't able to do this, talk with a counselor at your school, or a teacher that you trust. They will know you better than people on reddit, and they can offer advice, help, or just a neutral shoulder to lean on.", "Mom of a kid your age - I'm so sorry. This is not normal.

You sound like a great kid and do not deserve this kind of treatment.", "Everything you stated above is very alarming, and intervention on your behalf is needed.  Are there any aunts, uncles, teachers you trust that you could talk to?\n \nSeparately - as a kid who was verbally and (very minimally) physically abused as a child - *please do not take anything SF says critically or anything else as valid*.  You are awesome.  Really well grounded.  Especially considering what you are dealing with at home.   \n   \nStay in your shoes and keep doing your best.  Im sure plenty of redditors here will have better advice.  But feel free to reach out if you ever need someone to vent to.   \n   \nGood luck.  You are in a tough boat.", "This is not on you OP. You sound like a good egg. This is not normal behavior by your stepfather, especially given his late entrance on the scene. This is controlling behavior, and sounds like it is escalating. Blaming yourself and compromising further to get along with him is the mindset of someone being abused.\n\nI would share your concerns openly and privately with your mother. You don't need her to choose one or the other but she needs to stand up for you or risk your relationship - you are going to be out of the house in a few years.", "You could try talking to a school counselor about it. Maybe they can talk some sense into your mom.", "I would suggest family therapy if you can get them to do it. It\u2019s not likely that your SF will listen to you, but he might listen to another adult, or atleast your mom might. It might not work but it\u2019s worth a shot. \n\nDo you have any other family- aunts, uncles, grandparents- on either side that may be able to help advocate for you?", "Is there anyone else you could live with? Grandparents? Aunt or Uncle? Your stepfather is going so far over the bounds of decency it\u2019s disgusting! Your mother is even worse. She should be protecting you from this kind of behavior, not condoning it, and definitely not participating in what I would consider emotional and psychological abuse. NTA, and good luck.", "This isn't a guy you get along with, this is a guy you survive and get away from.", "Indeed.", "I dated a guy in high school who had a step dad almost exactly like this. I\u2019m very, very concerned that this is going to escalate. Please, please talk to a trusted adult at your school. Look into getting yourself emancipated at 16 like others suggested. You need a safety net in place if this continues.", "I would encourage you to talk to someone. You're not in such a bad position that they are going to pull you away from your family. CPS will always try to keep families together if at all possible. They aren't going to put you into foster care because your step-dad is a control freak. You have your basic necessities met and aren't experiencing violence. \n\nBut talking to an adult outside of the situation is going to get your mom to take your concerns more seriously as well as add tools to your toolbox to help you be able to advocate for yourself and put the way you are feeling into words. At the very least, having an actual person in your life who is sympathetic and doesn't dismiss your feelings is invaluable to keeping your mental health in check. \n\n\nYou deserve to be treated with kindness and respect. You deserve positive reinforcement for your achievements and trust that you have earned for being a responsible teenager. Just because you are not an adult doesn't mean that your feelings and opinions are less important or real.", "When I was 10 my mother married a man like this.  I couldn't do anything to \"behave correctly\".  He had decided I was a problem and there wasn't any real way today fix it because...  I wasn't a problem.  He created that in his mind.  It wasn't real, just like it's not real now with you.\n\nIt started small with: you can't wear that, you can't go there, and you can't watch that TV show (even though it was for kids).  To things like: I don't like the look on your face, I don't like that your tummy hurts and you don't want to eat dinner, no you can't talk to your mom about anything you can just talk to me.\n\nIt got to the point, after years of abuse, that other people started to realize the conditioning and trauma responses I had.  I dropped a spoon at my grandparent's house during dinner one night and froze, literally started shaking in fear and they had no idea why.  But if I'd done that at home...  It would have been hell to pay.  For simply dropping a spoon on accident.  I was 15.  I tripped once and touched the wall with my bare hand at someone's house and started to cry...  Because at home I'd have been punished for it because \"the oils in your hands leave stains on the walls even if you're clean\".\n\nI got in trouble for being afraid he'd hit me. I got in trouble for sneezing or coughing too much when I was sick. I got in trouble for saying I didn't want to be treated that way.  I got in trouble for looking/feeling hurt when he'd hurt me.  I got in trouble for trying to protect myself when he advanced towards me because he would \"never hurt\" me.  I got in trouble for him assuming I was always thinking nasty things about him.  I got in trouble for simply trying to survive.\n\nWhat happened to me wasn't normal, it wasn't my fault, and it absolutely was condoned by my mother.  And though she was experiencing her own abuse, it doesn't excuse her not protecting her child.   Before him my mother had been a single parent my entire life: loving, kind, and hard working for us.  She always put us above everything and I knew she loved us fully and completely.  She just got...  Overwhelmed, swept up, and I think conditioned to be a bit afraid.\n\nWhen I was 16 I told my mom she either got divorced and kept me around or she stayed married, I moved in with my aunt, and I didn't talk/see them anymore.  I was dead serious.  It took an ultimatum for my mother to really get it.  To understand exactly how bad it was and that no one was more important than her/her kids.\n\nI was surprised but she got that divorce and 20 years later we're closer, and healthier, than we've ever been.  I am lucky.  I haven't always been the lucky one but this time I was.  And I was able to work through that trauma.  I recognized what was happening, I didn't shy away, I advocated for myself.\n\nThere is nothing wrong with standing up for yourself when something is wrong.  Especially when it is hurting you.  Do not feel any guilt in that.\n\nAdvocate for yourself and get others who will do so as well.\n\nTell your teachers.  Tell your friend's and your friend's parents.  Tell your mother every day what he's doing and that you don't appreciate it.  Even if she doesn't want to listen.  Tell her you want a therapist.  Tell her when you feel unsafe,  unloved, threatened, policed, sexualized, belittled, and abused.  \n\nKeep saying it.  To everyone.\n\nAnd honestly, if you're safe, think about calling CPS yourself and telling them too.  Worst case scenario, your mom and SF get upset.  But isn't that the fallout you're already living with simply because you're, well, living?", "I'm very sorry you're going through this. Remember, there is nothing you can do to make the adults in your life behave better. There are things you can do to make your life a bit less miserable. The journaling helps. Another big one is finding an adult you trust at school that you can talk to. They won't be able to fix the problem, but they can be a listening ear when you need to talk. I had a guidance counselor at school that really helped me. A lot of the time we didn't even talk about my home life. It just really helped me to have an adult who got excited for me when I did well on a test, or encouraged me when I felt anxious, let me just cry when I needed to without judgement.\n\nThese are things your parents should be doing, but you don't need to be starved for this necessary support just because they're not. Reach out.", "In addition to helping you process and keep centered on who you really are through this abusive shitshow, journaling will also give you evidence later to look back on and remind yourself what you overcame, or why you should never go back, or that it really was as bad as you thought it was. Especially if you keep screenshots and other collaborating receipts too, it may serve as evidence in a divorce or emancipation situation. It may help your mom come to her senses someday when she starts to wake up (or when he turns his full focus to controlling her once you are out of the house) and asks you questions about how your  teen years were. Definitely do this, but make sure he can never find it (secret cloud account, physical journal you leave with a trusted friend, nothing on devices he pays for or has access to).", "I hope it goes well for you. 0P, I\u2019m rooting for you.

Some of the top colleges offer a lot more need based and academic based scholarships than you'd think.  The other suggestion I have is very dependent on whether or not you have a trusted adult in your life - someone who is eighteen or over, that you can really, \\*seriously\\* trust. If you do, I would suggest getting them to help you open a savings account. You need someone who is 18 to co-sign the account with you.

As a single mom, my mom never really had time to review all my assignments with me and just trusted that I would complete them or would ask if struggled with something (which was very rare) or that I would give her a heads-up if I got a poor grade or something (again, very rare). \n\nAnyway the first test I brought home to review with him was a 97% in chemistry. It was a very hard test and the top grade in the class by far, the next highest was 91%. But instead of praising me for the grade he started grilling me on the one question I had missed. I admitted I had gotten a formula mixed up and that I would study that topic carefully so as not to make the mistake again. I thought that would be the end of it, but he kept pressing:\n\nSF: What makes you think this grade is acceptable?\n\nMe: Well, it's the highest in the class by 6 points - the teacher even wrote \"Fantastic!\" on the test!\n\nSF: But you missed a question. What do you think the appropriate consequence should be for that?\n\nMe: Uh...do I really need a consequence? If you think I do, then maybe 30 minutes of extra study time to make sure I understand the question I missed? \n\nSF: Not good enough.\n\nMe: (at this point, trying to be funny thinking it will help me bond with SF) But I'm a teenager who still has stuff to learn even if I get top grades in the class. If I were perfect I could skip college and grad school and go straight to being the teacher!\n\nSF: I've had enough of your back talk and disrespectful attitude! I was going to ground you just for the weekend for the test grade but now it's going to be for a whole week.

As punishment, I got pulled out of band, which was the one-ton brick that broke the camel's back and kicked off the plunge into severe depression.\n\nI was out of that house at 16, partly because they didn't want me there anymore, partly because every adult around me was trying to help me to get out of that house. In my case, I was lucky to live in an area with excellent support services for teens. My school really helped me, led by my guidance counselor, who got me into a teen shelter and worked with local families to put me up so I could finish high school. She also recommended me for an amazing fullride scholarship for college, which set me up on a solid foundation. \n\nI'm sharing this story because I see so much of what I went through in your story. It's been over two decades and I'm still dealing with the aftermath. My father has been dead to me, which won't change because it's been confirmed by family that he thinks he did nothing wrong.\n\nThe only solution is to survive until you can get out of that household. When I was in psychiatric care, they were encouraging me to just hold on until I could escape to college, and afterwards told me they were happy I was out of that house.\n\nYou're living in an abusive home, particularly emotional abuse. You're a good kid with overall good grades, which is really in your favor. Are there any adults that can support you? Do you have any family members who can help? Is there a trusted adult at your school you can talk to? Are there local services to help teens? (I was beloved by staff at the teen shelter because I happily followed their extremely reasonable rules.)\n\nOne resource I had was the social security survivor's benefits I received from the death of my mom. This money basically served as child support to the families I stayed with to help cover my room and board.", "I don't know if you'll see this OP, but i strongly urge you to reach out to a safe adult at school like a duiance counselor.

I was intelligent, mature, did well at school, but my mom\u2019s ex-military husband was extremely controlling and authoritarian. He was never physically abusive but was very overbearing and strict in a way I definitely didn\u2019t need in order to be a good kid. They\u2019ve been divorced for 20 years now but my relationship with my mother was permanently affected by her unwillingness to stand up for me or put my needs first.\n\nIt\u2019s a shitty dynamic and there is unfortunately not much way around it. I was able to to get some breathing room by signing up for a ton of academic extracurriculars (debate, mock trial, school paper, drama) that kept me at school late year round so I could be home as little as possible. I also got a nice respectable boyfriend my Junior year, and was allowed to spend a lot of time at his place with his family (by that point the constant conflict between me and my mom\u2019s husband was making things very tense at home). These could be some options that will help until you can graduate and escape. \n\nNTA. Your stepdad is a controlling asshole.", "You can't wear green!!!

Certainly, I think if child protective services were called in, they would not be handing him out any commendations. I ask this because your mother does not seem to be protecting you at all, and that house is not a safe space. You are 16 and your view on this matters greatly, so if you want out and have a safe space to go, you may actually be able to get out.\n\nI honestly do not think you should wait until school is over to get out, so if you can seek the advice and support of another adult in your life, do it (but maybe quietly and get everything lined up before you pull the trigger). If that is not possible, my biggest advice to you is to work hard in school, get a job if you can, save up and get a scholarship/financial aid so that you are independent in every way once you turn 18.  Two years is a long time, but this may be one of those situations where biding your time for two years is worth the lifelong independence. \n\nBig hugs to you.

Unfortunately your stepdad is unlikely to change, and with your mom listening to him over you, leaving is probably going to be your best option.\n\nIn regards to leaving at 18, the best things you can do is either get a job to save money for moving out (tho tbh I honestly don't think your stepdad would allow this considering everything), OR see if a friend/family member would be willing to let you live with them at least until you have enough money and a stable enough job to move out. Be a little careful with this one, especially with family members, I've heard a lot of stories about people being abused trusting another family member to get them out only for them to turn the abused back to their family :/\n\nUntil then, try to follow the rules he set, even if they are really really stupid or annoying.
