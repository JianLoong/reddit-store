If you do continue to have contact, please leave future gifts at his home when you leave. Choose you always.", "NTA. Sounds like he got re-assimilated into the Borg continuum. You don't need to antagonize him however distance is probably best.", "NTA, in the same way that no one is required to accept apologies, you don\u2019t have to accept what your brother \u201cgave\u201d (preached) to you. Tossing the letter and book and never thinking about them again is non-confrontational and doesn\u2019t hurt anyone, and he\u2019ll never know if you never tell him. Your brother sounds preachy and any improvements he\u2019s made he\u2019ll attribute to god to try and convert you back from the look of things, and you shouldn\u2019t have to put up with that.", "NTA for throwing the book and letter out.  If you talk to him, it will give him an opportunity to preach to you.  I had a dear friend send me a message the other day.  She was being very patronizing.   This is a person who I bailed out of a mess she made, while I was travelling.  I accept her for who she is though, but I didn't respond to her communication.  Sometimes it's just best to leave things lay on the side of the road and walk right past them.", "NTA. You wouldn't be the asshole if you burned the book and letter in a fire and sent a video to him.", "Nta\n\nToss the letter, if you know where he could have bought the book, see if you can exchange it to get yourself something you'd like (but he'd hate), then send a picture of the new item before blocking him. \n\nOr, if you have any kind of small pet that needs bedding, shred the book, send a picture saying \"little (x) loves the present, I took the title to heart and *you* will no longer have a seat at my table or in my life\" then block him. \n\nEvery piece of advice involves block him though.", "YWNBTA. Your boundaries are yours, and it sounds like he's aware of what they are, but he chose to invade those boundaries anyway. You could send him a \"thanks, but no thanks,\" but you don't even owe him that.", "NTA.  You are the \"enemy\" if you don't follow his beliefs? I'd be pissed too.", "NTA.  That's an A H present on the level with giving a gospel tract instead of a tip in a restaurant.  It doesn't deserve a response.", "NTA.  I hate how this cult of family nonsense makes people like you stress when it sounds like you kinda need a plateau of peace *away* from stress for awhile.  Blood means EXACTLY one thing: Don't reproduce with this person.  Beyond that you owe them nothing.  Family isn't blood, it's who WANTED to be there for you.  Not out of some genetic obligation but bc they couldn't imagine *not* being there.  But hey.....silver lining is you have *both* in J.  Few people have true companionship with family (and sadly never realize it).  R can go kick rocks...honestly sounds like he just wants to get you back in the church so he can get a gold star.  You and J keep surviving together until surviving turns into thriving.  Leave R in the past where he knows he belongs.\n\nEdit:  Forgot to say best wishes...I know too well how it is dealing w the overly religious.", "NTA\n\nThere's better things to do in life than to give a shit about someone's deranged political views.", "NTA\n\nDoesn\u2019t sound like they really care about you as a person but just want to save face as a church going family.", "NAH. You can certainly choose who you have relationships with, so not responding to your brother is your call. You can even choose to break off with him completely.\n\nHolidays are a time where estranged friends/relatives often reach out with an olive branch.  You don't have an obligation to take it, but getting so pissed and triggered is a little much.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It sounds like he's trying to reach out and mend fences, but is just doing it in an awkward way for you. I'd just donate the book to a thrift store for somebody who would appreciate it, text him a thank you for thinking of you, and see what happens. Also, if he truly is toxic you aren't required to have a relationship with him (or anybody else) regardless of whether or not they are related to you.", "NTA. \nHe's not ready to be the brother you need and deserve yet. \nIt will come.", "Overall NTA.  \n\nI think your brother honestly believes he is being helpful.  \"I'm ready to talk and be a better brother\" is his way of opening up a dialog with you.  It's understandable if you don't accept this gesture, but at least try to understand his point of view with the gift.  (Bear in mind I'm somewhere between atheist and anti-theist and if I got this gift from someone, I'd smile then quietly go to the bathroom where my eyes would roll up so hard and so fast they'd probably pop out.)", "NTA. I have an aunt who acts like your brother. I don\u2019t respond.

Seriously, thank you. Idk what else to say...", "I mean, I opened that gift in front of people, I'm sure he felt confident that it was a good and helpful gift. And I said thank you. But it feels like a slap in the face to me. It really says a lot about what he thinks of me, despite knowing nothing about my life choices or mental health. I don't want to understand someone who sees me as a mission rather than a person, but it's sad that I do understand because I was in his shoes at one point.", "Aw, no need to say anything at all.  Glad my ramblings helped ya.  You just relax and have as good of a holiday week/weekend as you can.  Happy Holidays/New Year!  :)", "Makes perfect sense.  You're not an AH to acknowledge that someone tried in their own way be to nice but utterly failed, to the point that they caused additional pain.  Nor do you owe him forgiveness just because \"he meant well\".  Personally I find it a little easier if I know someone was trying to be nice but ended up being an AH vs. knowing they intended to be an AH all along.  That just means it hurts a little less, not that I'm suddenly okay with what happened."]}
