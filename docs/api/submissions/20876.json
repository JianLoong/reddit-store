Mom must not be biased in her explanation.\n\nFor all we know it could be mental illness. Been there done that with a sister who refused treatment because in her world schizophrenia was normal. \n\nShe was diagnosed in early adulthood so she could make her own choices about her treatment. Eventually my dad kept her from visiting them because she hit my mother. She chose to go no contact. They helped as much as they could but it was limited since she was an adult. \n\nMy siblings and I all tried to help her but again she was an adult and can make her own decisions. My only requirement was no alcohol while smoking. She drank boxes of cheap wine and chain smoked. Not a good combination.\n\nThe only thing that got her into treatment was her behavior. It escalated enough that she was finally arrested and then taken into a halfway home run by a church. Not the best way to live but at least no longer at risk to herself or others. But she absolutely hated those drugs used for treatment. And she had gone thru several different types. So she chose to go without them (this was 80s & 90s).\n\nIn our family my sister was never hidden from my nieces or nephews. Before her illness became unmanageable she was at all family get togethers so they did know her but she was never allowed to be with them unattended. We know she loved them quite a bit and she also knew she wasn\u2019t the best fit for either parenthood or child minding. She was aware enough to at least to understand that she needed to prevent pregnancy.\n\nShe consistently complained that we treated her badly and we had to live within her boundaries. Her boundaries were not in the best interest of our safety or those around us. \n\nShe eventually took us thru some sort of mediation so that we would not interfere with her care. To my knowledge none of us did that. \n\nBut we did have requirements if she chose to live with us. No violent behavior, no smoking, no alcohol, and no guns. She didn\u2019t want to do that so after the mediation we had very little if any contact with her and when we did it was on her terms. If she needed something we\u2019d get it for her. \n\nBut this is just MY experience and how I view this. I am not going to make a YTA judgment on OP yet. \n\nBut I\u2019m also not going to go towards the example Relevant_Birthday516 provides either because it really could be both ways. \n\nWitnessed that with a friend who came out as a lesbian in college and one sister basically told her she was going to hell. Did a LOT of damage to my friend but with age and life those sisters were able to forge a relationship. But both had to free themselves from the religious boundaries they grew up in and look at the person in front of them as human and worthy of love and care. A lot of baggage for the both of them but they survived it. Both are parents and their kids were never off limits by the way. But they had to respect each others parenting styles. Besides the going to hell sister became pregnant out of wedlock so she was already on a slippery slope in terms of religious doctrine.\n\nAt best OP \u2018s situation is ESH. But still OP\u2019s kids should not be in the middle of this. They should never be in a position where they are vulnerable. \n\nOP & sister at least need to have a basic relationship where they can develop some sort of trust with one another.

Well last week I had to stay home from our trip to Florida due to complications with my pregnancy and my mom asked to take my son. She met up with my sister at the zoo to meet my son and her excuse was that she had no babysitter. We have plenty of family and friends there so I don\u2019t think this was true.

Maybe it is how you are saying it. Maybe what you are saying is crueler than you intend. Maybe it just doesn't sound sincere.\n\nLike someone telling someone gay they can hang out as long as they don't talk about their sexuality seems fair to someone homophobic as a compromise, but to the gay person, it is a blatant statement of 'we don't really respect you, we just want to pretend part of who you are doesn't exist/was never learned about, for our own comfort', which is hurtful, and will lead to them rejecting it.\n\nYou know your sister's personality best, but as long as she will remain civil about you and your other sisters to the kids, is not a safety concern and won't teach your kids dangerous/cruel behaviours, it would feel needlessly spiteful to deny your kids a relationship with their aunt and could just damage things further needlessly.\n\nIf you want a relationship with her, it might be best to give her some space, and take the time to do some introspection and be open to hearing, that what you are saying and doing may not align with what you are actually trying to express or get across.

My mom and her mom had a fall out with my granddad because they divorced and he treated them bad. He moved away but still sent cards for christmas and birthdays. When i was a teen she told me what went on but also said that she thinks i should contact him, we exchanged a few letters before he passed.
