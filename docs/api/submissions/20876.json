She can't have her cake and eat it too\u2014she needs to reap what she has sown.\n\nIt sounds like she probably just wants to isolate your kids from you so she can turn them against you. They know you and your sister don't talk, and they probably assume that one of you did something bad to the other.

As a parent, I can't allow my children to spend days in a different city with a person who has no relationship with me.

How old are your kids?\n\nThere's deferentially an argument for letting your kids have a connection with a loving member of the family, I my mums in a similar situation with her sister.\n\nBut if you think theres a personality problem that caused your falling out (selfish, aggressive, stubborn etc) that might affect your kids as well.\n\nI'd say try to at least tolerate each other for the kids sake, like a divorced couple.

I had the online things to show so he explained to her that if she needed/wanted them she needed to contact him not me. \n\nShe contacted me again and again. In the end asking for Money. I was 12 at that point. \nI blocked her. Talked to my dad again. He again called her. Yelled at her. The Fallout was aweful. The next time he talked to her was when grandma passed. 10 years later. \n\n\nThe thing is, i dont know your reasons for nog contacting your sister. I dont need to know.

If your sister isn't willing to reach out to you and make a gesture, then why does she get to be the \"cool aunt\" to your kids? That could potentially make your kids question, \"why is auntie so nice to us but never spends time with mom?\" which could be a really awkward parenting moment when it inevitably happens.\n\nSlight AH to your mom too, for getting in the middle of it.", "NTA\n\nYou are a family package (pun intented).

But I am 100% respecting the parents wishes (even if they have no respect for me)  \n\n\nAlthough - I also recently started up contact with my estranged Aunt who was the black sheep of the family. So I think its about not bad mouthing in front of your kids, and not blocking their way if they want contact as adults - they can decide for themselves.  \n\n\nMy mum would flip her lid if she knew as she is the main driving gossipy force behind the whole family hating this aunt.. but I am also a blacksheep so its nice to have kindred family.", "NTA.\n\nWithout knowing the nature of your falling out, if she is generally a reasonably behaved productive member of society, I may allow her to see my kids under my supervision if everyone can remain civil.

If she wants nothing to do with you but all to do with your kids she has no business at all seeing them, the mother trying to be the \"let's not fight everyone just let her walk all over you and get your kids without you\" is not what she should be preaching if your sister is the one avoiding any and all reason to make amends.", "NTA\n\nShe has no entitlement to your kids.", "INFO\n\nWhy exactly did you guys fall out?

However you and your sisters issues are just that, your issues.  Don't make them your kids issues as well.  They don't need that.\n\nIf your kids love her and she loves your kids and they are safe and happy when they spend time with her, I don't see the harm in it.

She has had times where she had issues with our other sister and mother, but it's like she choses one of us to be the \"bad\" guy right now it's me and has been for a long time and she hardly talks to my mom.  We have not done anything to effect our relationship between like me and my nieces, and her with my son/daughter.  However, besides some gift sending and a few short calls/texts I received from one of her daughters, we haven't had much communication.   She was in my area once and asked her daughter if she wanted to see us, but her daughter declined (I don't blame her would have been awkward as hell)....I don't know how old your children are or how fresh your cut has been with your sister, but I'd ask the kids what they want and just allow do what they say.  If you think your sister is not a threat there is not real good reason to deny them a relationship.....this is of course dependent on the ages of your children if they are very young, I would not agree to this without myself present.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
