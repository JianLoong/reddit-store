I think the judgment would depend on why there was a fall out. If for insta de you and your siblings did something egregious which has pushed your sister to not wanting to know y\u2019all I would say you guys are the AH. But if the opposite were true then she is.", "NTA. I'm in a similar situation. No relationship with me, means no relationship with my kids.", "NTA. Not something I personally would be comfortable with.", "INFO\n\nI get why some people don't want to share too much on social media, but I don't think anyone could make a sound judgement without knowing what the deal is?\n\nHow old are the kids? What was the fallout over? Could your mother help a rapprochement? Are you trying to mend things and maybe this is a first step in that?", "There really isn't enough information in the post to adequately judge the situation. What happened to cause the rift between your sister and the other siblings? Who tried to fix the relationships? You and your siblings or your sister?", "NTA  \n\n\nExcept in cases of divorce, unless a person has a good relationship with both parents, they should not have a relationship with any minor children.    \n\n\nIt's really just that simple.", "NTA: Your sister doesn't want to have a relationship with you for a reason. She will, consciously or subconsciously, express her feelings about you to your children.\n\nIf she likes spending time with children but doesn't have any of her own there are fantastic organizations that need volunteers (Girls Club/Boys Club) where she would get to mentor a child/children.\n\nMake sure your mother knows she is to never ever let your sister interact with your children.", "Agreed, I\u2019d be concerned having my kids around someone like OP\u2019s sister especially with how she\u2019s acting.", "I think this is the most important question here. And I find it sus that OP\u2019s edit is intentionally vague.", "I'm in a similar situation with my brother. He continuously disrespected me (trash talking my fiance to other family memebers, calling and screaming at me because I made a fb post that had nothing to do with him, saying me having a social studies teaching degree was a stupid degree, etc) and when I put my foot down on it he never even apologized.\n\n I still see my niece and nephew, my nephew was born before the fallout, i just refuse to be around my brother except on holidays, and even then I dont speak to him unless I have to. My dad brings them around. So I think we really need more info about the situation before anyone can make a fair judgement.", "Why do you assume the estranged sister has a non-heteronormative lifestyle? Could be OP & estranged sister doesn\u2019t agree with it. \n\nBut in the end if sister wants a relationship with kids, she has to have a relationship with parent. Sister needs to understand what boundaries children are given, what specific health care needs are required & the like. How will estranged sister have this info if she doesn\u2019t have some sort of interaction with parent? How will parent know her parenting wishes are honored and her kids are being cared for if the two siblings don\u2019t interact?\n\nMom should butt out. These folks are adults.\n\nI agree more info is needed but NTA. I don\u2019t have kids but sending them off to stay with someone who has gone NC & has no relationship with you is a bad idea.", "It sounds like OP did something to sister and sister is keeping her distance, but also doesn\u2019t want the kids affected so is making an effort to see them.\n\nThere are more holes than Swiss cheese in this story", "Exactly. In my experience, anyone leaving out important info like that is hiding some very important details.", "The person you're responding to is specifically **not** assuming anything."]}
