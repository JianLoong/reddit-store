{"id": 20563, "submission_id": "14ipmiv", "title": "AITA for telling my niece she isn't allowed to touch our snacks anymore?", "selftext": "My sister (41) and my niece (12) live with me (31), my wife (29) and our 2 sons (12, 6). My wife is currently pregnant and she has stated that she cannot figure out if this is her hormones or not and asked that I post here for unbiased feedback. Now, the reason they live with us is because my sister's ex husband is a piece of work and often got on my nieces case about food. She is extremely food insecure now- but in a hoarding food sense. To a point of her freaking out if my kids eat snacks because there \"won't be enough for her\", even if the cupboards are full of snacks and food. They've been here for bordering 3 months now and we had never once told her she couldn't eat our food until now. \n\nMy sister babies my niece a lot because of everything they've been through and I get it but it's starting to cause a lot of tension. Like my niece will be sitting on the couch with popcorn and cheez-itz and Rice Krispy Treats and will throw an absolute tantrum and go check the cupboards to see how much food is left after our kids get a snack and start yelling \"mumma, they're going to eat it all\". It's fucking infuriating, even to me, but especially my wife- who buys all of the food. My sister's job pays really shit so she contributes very little to the food or cost of living. We have sat my sister down and tried working out a snack plan or something to that affect because our tolerance of my niece and her food behaviors are quickly flying out the window but my sister keeps saying \"she's in therapy, it won't be like this forever\" and essentially does nothing about her daughters behaviors other than baby talking her (ie: \"it's okay baby, I'm sure they will leave you some\").\n\nWell, yesterday I had just gotten home from work and our kids were getting ready to go to their sports. My wife told the kids to grab some snacks for the ride because it would be a late dinner (tournament week). They grabbed a couple bags of chips and some freezer pops. As soon as my kids got in the freezer for the pops, my niece is in a full melt down. \"You can't have those, I wanted them, momma their eating all the freezer pops!\" My wife snaps a bit and says \"my kids can eat the food I bought!\" And walks out. I then tell my niece and my sister that our kids snacks aren't to be touched anymore and that she would have to start buying her kid her own food because we are past our limit and she's not doing anything to help. My niece was crying, saying \"so they get all of it? That's not fair\" and my sister was carrying the same tune; stating I'm heartless of my nieces condition and going to make it worse. AITA?\n\nETA: my niece is in therapy and has been since the split between her parents. My sister is trying to get food stamps but it's currently on hold until the court makes a verdict on Child Support and Medical Insurance.", "created_utc": 1687708391, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14ipmiv/aita_for_telling_my_niece_she_isnt_allowed_to/", "score": 83, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She's obviously not supporting her daughter in any theraputic manner but as you said \"babying\" her which isn't helpful! Your neice has serious issues which is sad but allowing her to cause tension, stress, etc in your home is unacceptable, harmful to all of your family members (imagine a 6yo being screamed at by a 12yo for obeying their mum by grabbing snacks in their own home???) and again not helpful to her. Your sister needs to develop a move-out plan and in the meantime pay for and store ALL of her daughter's snacks etc in her/their room, not the family kitchen. Your family should not be subjected to your nieces inappropriate behaviour - there is simply no need for it.", "NTA\n\nYour niece has understandable trauma, but she is certainly causing your own children anxiety around food now too. That needs to stop immediately before it causes serious damage. Your children are your top priority and you have to protect them.", "NTA\n\nI understand trauma and food hoarding but this is a whole other level. The kids mama needs to be firm and help the kid overcome this not baby her and coddle her. All she's doing is reinforcing that it's okay to give in to the panic.", "Seems simple enough? Sis( with her shit paying job) can spend her money on the kids therapy and a stocked food cabinet in her room. That way you can have your sanity, and the kid can have her own food hoard she's secure no one else will touch.\n\nThen move them out, like ASAP, before the weird food relationship starts effecting your own kids. And your wife is pregnant? She's got the patience of Job. NTA and good luck!", "NTA But! Cutting your niece off from all the snacks is only going to make this worse for her and she doesn't deserve that. One of you needs to have a conversation with the therapist. Because I suspect your sister is either lying about what is going on to the therapist or not passing on their recommendations. There is no way the current solution is to do nothing and let her create food insecurity issues in _your_ children by attacking them verbally any time they snack.\n\nIf you can, get a video of her reaction when your kids snack. It might help and will provide evidence to the therapist if her mother has been downplaying things.", "NTA but is it possible to make up named snack drawers/boxes/bags and share the snacks out, so every child has a fair share. Then if the niece runs out it's up to her mum to top it up? I think food hoarding can be quite a difficult trauma to overcome, as it's rooted in control (or lack of) and can lead to eating disorders.", "NTA  The bare minimum your sister can do if her daughter is having issues with food is buy her snacks and contribute to the bill for groceries. Combining households is never easy. Adjustments need to be made by everyone. However, your children should not have to deal with and cater to the complex phycological problems of a child.", "NtA. Seems you\u2019re in a bind taking them in your home. Although you mean well , Wished you thought hard before taking them in since her daughter have issues but now your family is suffering . Is there a relative where your sister can move? Don\u2019t sacrifice your family\u2019s peace  and your wife is pregnant . She doesn\u2019t need the stress . Your sisters issues are hers alone . Give her an ultimatum the kick them out", "Did your sister tell you the foodstamps are on hold or have you seen actual paperwork? Because, that sounds very suspicious.  I'd ask to see actual paperwork. Usually, if you don't have money for food they give you the foodstamps and then worry about the child support/ custody issues later. I think you maybe being told stories.", "I think this may be beyond a Reddit sub question (especially this one). Your niece is in therapy, and it may be a while before her food insecurity issue is resolved. Maybe just tell her you love her, and there will always be food for her, but she cannot stop others from having food. I don't know - but good luck.", "NTA, your niece is 12 and it's kinda odd that she's complaining on a similar level as a 3-5 year old. I get trauma can really affect people in weird ways and I'm glad she's getting therapy for it, but your sister should really have an active role in helping with her food insecurity instead of just hoping the therapist fixes everything and babying her.   \n\n\nYou've got kids of your own and they shouldn't be made to feel bad for doing something as simple as eating food. I get the situation that your sister is in, but also for you and your family.   \n\n\nA lot of this feels like a \"heat of the moment blowup\" and I think it's best to have a serious conversation with everyone (maybe even including the therapist) and possibly working out a regimented food plan while your niece is recovering.", "NTA. I get the frustration. Having said that however, food insecurity is a real mental health problem often stemming from abuse. This certainly isn\u2019t going to help it. I hate to say it, but I don\u2019t know how you move forward without them moving out. If you cut her off from food it will aggravate her problem. If you don\u2019t address it, everyone else is resentful and your kids develop issues related to your tolerance of your nieces issues in the home. I wish you and your family love and patience as you navigate it.", "NTA YOU bought them and your spoiled niece and sister do NOT get to dictate who gets to eat what in YOUR house. They'd do well to remember they are GUESTS in YOUR house", "NAH\n\nThis is a difficult situation, and you didn't handle this situation well but I see this is hard for you and you are doing a great thing in letting them stay.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt's very common for foster kids to have food insecurity worries. I know she is with her mom, but it sounds like there was abuse around food. So the kid has a lot of anxiety.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI do not know your situation, but would it be possible to get a little mini fridge and plastic bin for her room? Where she can keep her own food, that is HER food that no one else can touch?\n\nThese websites has tips and tricks for dealing with these situations:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[https://creatingafamily.org/adoption-category/hoarding-overeating-food-obsessions-adopted-foster-kids/](https://creatingafamily.org/adoption-category/hoarding-overeating-food-obsessions-adopted-foster-kids/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[https://nacac.org/resource/healing-from-food-insecurity/](https://nacac.org/resource/healing-from-food-insecurity/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGood luck! You can do this!", "NTA", "NTA. As someone who grew up food insecure, and had the same hoarding problem with food, I understand where your niece is coming from. However, her mom is making the insecurity worse. By saying the kids will leave her some, she is telling her daughter she is entitled to the food. The mom of your niece needs to start stepping up and parenting. Telling daughter that the food is to share and that she cannot have it all. And telling her daughter that you and your wife buy it so her daughter gets absolutely no say in who takes what and how much they take.", "NTA. Your sister has allowed her daughter's problems to be your family problem. You don't know what psychological damage is being done to your children. Your wife is at her limit. it is time to protect your own family.\n\nIf your sister can not come up with a workable plan quickly they have to find another place to live. That way all the food in their new place can be your niece's.", "Of course NTA. Time to tell your sister to get packing.", "Your sister is not helping by babying this child. \n\nIf she has her own store that she can manage and control, that may help. Whatever her therapist thinks. But you will end up with issues with your own kids at this rate.\n\nNTA", "Is your niece in therapy?can your sister not get on food stamps?", "This sounds like it could be helped by giving niece her own snack drawer/container. Food just for her that no one else can touch. Any tantrums over shared food no longer tolerated as she can assure herself her drawer stays full since they won't be taking from it.\n\nNAH. You're at your limit and your sister is probably just following the beginning steps of the therapist's advice since this is still a super fresh situation and I doubt therapy is super long or frequent while divorce is ongoing.", "Y'all are doing them a huge favor in housing and feeding them, but the specific response here was probably retraumatizing in that it played with the niece's exact insecurities & triggers\n\nI think that was probably going nuclear and a smaller response was warranted, but it's hard to call either your or pregnant wife an AH when they would be potentially houseless and starving without your support.\n\nReally the other comments are right that your sister probably needs to be engaging with the therapist and coming up with appropriate responses that reassure her daughter of her own food security while limiting her controlling behavior over your kids... And that's something you can participate in\n\nBut, you don't have to, and if sister isn't on board that can be a losing battle anyway.\n\nUltimately you & your wife get to determine how much hospitality and grace you can show here, especially when there's competing needs between your sister's kids and your wife and kids... And I don't think you're the AH if you decide a boundary that favors your own kids even if that does suck for your sister", "INFO - you mention your niece is in therapy.   Have you been able to discuss the food situation with the therapist and come up with a response plan for home?", "NTA. Your sister's inability to properly parent her child should not condemn your children to suffer in their own home. Eventually you're going to have to kick her out. Just as an FYI. And it will not be pleasant.", "NTA. It\u2019s not your responsibility to feed them and their very lucky to have someone like you that welcomes them in your home. Your sister needs to learn boundaries and start disciplining your niece so that she will learn to be grateful for the foods your providing her. Nonetheless, I hope your niece gets the help she needs.", "ESH Sister must buy her own snacks. Why are you subjecting your children to this?  This is their childhood. Your wife was right to finally speak up.  You should have along time ago. Now niece's November about snacks is affecting your children, but so what? Niece and sister outrank everyone else!", "NAH. You aren't wrong for being at wits end about your nieces' behavior, and I think your sister is right that this is something that is best handled by a therapist. But also this behavior does need to be addressed, it could be creating disordered eating in your own kids.\n\nYOU need to talk to the therapist to ask how best to resolve this. My guess would be a mini fridge that your kids never touch, that is only for niece's food, (visibly give her 1/3 of the snacks on shopping day) would go a long way towards helping. Also ask the therapist if working through the logic 'Okay, so they eat it all. And then we are out of freezer pops. What then? Do you need there to be freezer pops, or is there lots of other food in the house?' would be helpful at this stage.", "ESH maybe your niece needs a cupboard of snacks that is just for her until this gets sorted out.", "ESH\n\nI work with many kids who have gone through what your niece went through and all of you are acting poorly and not doing this poor kid any damn favors.\n\nWhat I'm gonna suggest yall do is 1. Get her her own snack stash she can keep in a safe place near her that no one else can touch. 2. Make sure your niece understands that there is always food avaliable, try and leave a snack bowl out or something and 3. Stop fucking yelling at her and blaming her. Saying she can't have any of the food at all is only reinforcing the problem. \n\nGod I hate the way people on this sub treat traumatized kids.", "So food issues like this, they don't really go away? Ever.\nI mean, it sounds like he legit starved her.\nIf that's the case, well - you can look at the long term results of a starvation experiment done in the 1940s. With willing participants, and they still did not get over it.\n\nHonestly, a soft YTA. You're at your breaking point. I get it.\nThe sister probably doesn't know what to do either. But not coping makes her the AH too.\n\nIf you intend to keep living together, if you have your niece's best interests at heart - all three of you should go sit with the therapist and develop an actual game plan.\n\nAlso, is niece childish in other ways? Possibly when she's not quite anxious, she too could suggest something to solve the issue (when pressed and with help, my four year old niece can think of ways to solve certain conflicts,   so if this twelve year old cannot, she needs a lot more help. And it's probably not just trauma but actual developmental issues).", "I'm going to go against the grain here and give a gentle ESH, specifically for involving your niece in your reaction. Had you only had the conversation with your sister, I would have said NTA. She's being a terrible parent and not talking responsibility for her kid. \n\nYour issue and anger are legit and you've gotta protect your home, but you may have made your niece's issues worse, when you could have just taken your sister aside to draw the same boundary. To me, not taking the compassionate route for the benefit of a child, especially when the kid's shittiness is caused by abuse, is being an AH.\n\nEDIT: Needed fewer words to make my point", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
