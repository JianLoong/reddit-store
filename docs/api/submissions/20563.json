{"id": 20563, "submission_id": "14ipmiv", "title": "AITA for telling my niece she isn't allowed to touch our snacks anymore?", "selftext": "My sister (41) and my niece (12) live with me (31), my wife (29) and our 2 sons (12, 6). My wife is currently pregnant and she has stated that she cannot figure out if this is her hormones or not and asked that I post here for unbiased feedback. Now, the reason they live with us is because my sister's ex husband is a piece of work and often got on my nieces case about food. She is extremely food insecure now- but in a hoarding food sense. To a point of her freaking out if my kids eat snacks because there \"won't be enough for her\", even if the cupboards are full of snacks and food. They've been here for bordering 3 months now and we had never once told her she couldn't eat our food until now. \n\nMy sister babies my niece a lot because of everything they've been through and I get it but it's starting to cause a lot of tension. Like my niece will be sitting on the couch with popcorn and cheez-itz and Rice Krispy Treats and will throw an absolute tantrum and go check the cupboards to see how much food is left after our kids get a snack and start yelling \"mumma, they're going to eat it all\". It's fucking infuriating, even to me, but especially my wife- who buys all of the food. My sister's job pays really shit so she contributes very little to the food or cost of living. We have sat my sister down and tried working out a snack plan or something to that affect because our tolerance of my niece and her food behaviors are quickly flying out the window but my sister keeps saying \"she's in therapy, it won't be like this forever\" and essentially does nothing about her daughters behaviors other than baby talking her (ie: \"it's okay baby, I'm sure they will leave you some\").\n\nWell, yesterday I had just gotten home from work and our kids were getting ready to go to their sports. My wife told the kids to grab some snacks for the ride because it would be a late dinner (tournament week). They grabbed a couple bags of chips and some freezer pops. As soon as my kids got in the freezer for the pops, my niece is in a full melt down. \"You can't have those, I wanted them, momma their eating all the freezer pops!\" My wife snaps a bit and says \"my kids can eat the food I bought!\" And walks out. I then tell my niece and my sister that our kids snacks aren't to be touched anymore and that she would have to start buying her kid her own food because we are past our limit and she's not doing anything to help. My niece was crying, saying \"so they get all of it? That's not fair\" and my sister was carrying the same tune; stating I'm heartless of my nieces condition and going to make it worse. AITA?\n\nETA: my niece is in therapy and has been since the split between her parents. My sister is trying to get food stamps but it's currently on hold until the court makes a verdict on Child Support and Medical Insurance.", "created_utc": 1687708391, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14ipmiv/aita_for_telling_my_niece_she_isnt_allowed_to/", "score": 358, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She's obviously not supporting her daughter in any theraputic manner but as you said \"babying\" her which isn't helpful! Your neice has serious issues which is sad but allowing her to cause tension, stress, etc in your home is unacceptable, harmful to all of your family members (imagine a 6yo being screamed at by a 12yo for obeying their mum by grabbing snacks in their own home???) and again not helpful to her. Your sister needs to develop a move-out plan and in the meantime pay for and store ALL of her daughter's snacks etc in her/their room, not the family kitchen. Your family should not be subjected to your nieces inappropriate behaviour - there is simply no need for it.", "NTA\n\nYour niece has understandable trauma, but she is certainly causing your own children anxiety around food now too. That needs to stop immediately before it causes serious damage. Your children are your top priority and you have to protect them.", "NTA\n\nI understand trauma and food hoarding but this is a whole other level. The kids mama needs to be firm and help the kid overcome this not baby her and coddle her. All she's doing is reinforcing that it's okay to give in to the panic.", "Seems simple enough? Sis( with her shit paying job) can spend her money on the kids therapy and a stocked food cabinet in her room. That way you can have your sanity, and the kid can have her own food hoard she's secure no one else will touch.\n\nThen move them out, like ASAP, before the weird food relationship starts effecting your own kids. And your wife is pregnant? She's got the patience of Job. NTA and good luck!", "NTA But! Cutting your niece off from all the snacks is only going to make this worse for her and she doesn't deserve that. One of you needs to have a conversation with the therapist. Because I suspect your sister is either lying about what is going on to the therapist or not passing on their recommendations. There is no way the current solution is to do nothing and let her create food insecurity issues in _your_ children by attacking them verbally any time they snack.\n\nIf you can, get a video of her reaction when your kids snack. It might help and will provide evidence to the therapist if her mother has been downplaying things.", "NTA but is it possible to make up named snack drawers/boxes/bags and share the snacks out, so every child has a fair share. Then if the niece runs out it's up to her mum to top it up? I think food hoarding can be quite a difficult trauma to overcome, as it's rooted in control (or lack of) and can lead to eating disorders.", "NTA  The bare minimum your sister can do if her daughter is having issues with food is buy her snacks and contribute to the bill for groceries. Combining households is never easy. Adjustments need to be made by everyone. However, your children should not have to deal with and cater to the complex phycological problems of a child.", "NtA. Seems you\u2019re in a bind taking them in your home. Although you mean well , Wished you thought hard before taking them in since her daughter have issues but now your family is suffering . Is there a relative where your sister can move? Don\u2019t sacrifice your family\u2019s peace  and your wife is pregnant . She doesn\u2019t need the stress . Your sisters issues are hers alone . Give her an ultimatum the kick them out", "Did your sister tell you the foodstamps are on hold or have you seen actual paperwork? Because, that sounds very suspicious.  I'd ask to see actual paperwork. Usually, if you don't have money for food they give you the foodstamps and then worry about the child support/ custody issues later. I think you maybe being told stories.", "I think this may be beyond a Reddit sub question (especially this one). Your niece is in therapy, and it may be a while before her food insecurity issue is resolved. Maybe just tell her you love her, and there will always be food for her, but she cannot stop others from having food. I don't know - but good luck.", "NTA, your niece is 12 and it's kinda odd that she's complaining on a similar level as a 3-5 year old. I get trauma can really affect people in weird ways and I'm glad she's getting therapy for it, but your sister should really have an active role in helping with her food insecurity instead of just hoping the therapist fixes everything and babying her.   \n\n\nYou've got kids of your own and they shouldn't be made to feel bad for doing something as simple as eating food. I get the situation that your sister is in, but also for you and your family.   \n\n\nA lot of this feels like a \"heat of the moment blowup\" and I think it's best to have a serious conversation with everyone (maybe even including the therapist) and possibly working out a regimented food plan while your niece is recovering.", "NTA. I get the frustration. Having said that however, food insecurity is a real mental health problem often stemming from abuse. This certainly isn\u2019t going to help it. I hate to say it, but I don\u2019t know how you move forward without them moving out. If you cut her off from food it will aggravate her problem. If you don\u2019t address it, everyone else is resentful and your kids develop issues related to your tolerance of your nieces issues in the home. I wish you and your family love and patience as you navigate it.", "NTA YOU bought them and your spoiled niece and sister do NOT get to dictate who gets to eat what in YOUR house.

The mom of your niece needs to start stepping up and parenting. Telling daughter that the food is to share and that she cannot have it all. And telling her daughter that you and your wife buy it so her daughter gets absolutely no say in who takes what and how much they take.", "NTA. Your sister has allowed her daughter's problems to be your family problem. You don't know what psychological damage is being done to your children. Your wife is at her limit. it is time to protect your own family.\n\nIf your sister can not come up with a workable plan quickly they have to find another place to live.

Food just for her that no one else can touch. Any tantrums over shared food no longer tolerated as she can assure herself her drawer stays full since they won't be taking from it.\n\nNAH. You're at your limit and your sister is probably just following the beginning steps of the therapist's advice since this is still a super fresh situation and I doubt therapy is super long or frequent while divorce is ongoing.", "Y'all are doing them a huge favor in housing and feeding them, but the specific response here was probably retraumatizing in that it played with the niece's exact insecurities & triggers\n\nI think that was probably going nuclear and a smaller response was warranted, but it's hard to call either your or pregnant wife an AH when they would be potentially houseless and starving without your support.\n\nReally the other comments are right that your sister probably needs to be engaging with the therapist and coming up with appropriate responses that reassure her daughter of her own food security while limiting her controlling behavior over your kids... And that's something you can participate in\n\nBut, you don't have to, and if sister isn't on board that can be a losing battle anyway.\n\nUltimately you & your wife get to determine how much hospitality and grace you can show here, especially when there's competing needs between your sister's kids and your wife and kids... And I don't think you're the AH if you decide a boundary that favors your own kids even if that does suck for your sister", "INFO - you mention your niece is in therapy.   Have you been able to discuss the food situation with the therapist and come up with a response plan for home?", "NTA. Your sister's inability to properly parent her child should not condemn your children to suffer in their own home. Eventually you're going to have to kick her out. Just as an FYI. And it will not be pleasant.", "NTA. It\u2019s not your responsibility to feed them and their very lucky to have someone like you that welcomes them in your home. Your sister needs to learn boundaries and start disciplining your niece so that she will learn to be grateful for the foods your providing her. Nonetheless, I hope your niece gets the help she needs.", "ESH Sister must buy her own snacks. Why are you subjecting your children to this?  This is their childhood. Your wife was right to finally speak up.  You should have along time ago. Now niece's November about snacks is affecting your children, but so what? Niece and sister outrank everyone else!", "NAH. You aren't wrong for being at wits end about your nieces' behavior, and I think your sister is right that this is something that is best handled by a therapist. But also this behavior does need to be addressed, it could be creating disordered eating in your own kids.\n\nYOU need to talk to the therapist to ask how best to resolve this. My guess would be a mini fridge that your kids never touch, that is only for niece's food, (visibly give her 1/3 of the snacks on shopping day) would go a long way towards helping. Also ask the therapist if working through the logic 'Okay, so they eat it all. And then we are out of freezer pops. What then? Do you need there to be freezer pops, or is there lots of other food in the house?' would be helpful at this stage.", "ESH maybe your niece needs a cupboard of snacks that is just for her until this gets sorted out.", "ESH\n\nI work with many kids who have gone through what your niece went through and all of you are acting poorly and not doing this poor kid any damn favors.\n\nWhat I'm gonna suggest yall do is 1. Get her her own snack stash she can keep in a safe place near her that no one else can touch. 2. Make sure your niece understands that there is always food avaliable, try and leave a snack bowl out or something and 3. Stop fucking yelling at her and blaming her. Saying she can't have any of the food at all is only reinforcing the problem. \n\nGod I hate the way people on this sub treat traumatized kids.", "So food issues like this, they don't really go away? Ever.\nI mean, it sounds like he legit starved her.\nIf that's the case, well - you can look at the long term results of a starvation experiment done in the 1940s. With willing participants, and they still did not get over it.\n\nHonestly, a soft YTA. You're at your breaking point. I get it.\nThe sister probably doesn't know what to do either. But not coping makes her the AH too.\n\nIf you intend to keep living together, if you have your niece's best interests at heart - all three of you should go sit with the therapist and develop an actual game plan.\n\nAlso, is niece childish in other ways? Possibly when she's not quite anxious, she too could suggest something to solve the issue (when pressed and with help, my four year old niece can think of ways to solve certain conflicts,   so if this twelve year old cannot, she needs a lot more help. And it's probably not just trauma but actual developmental issues).", "I'm going to go against the grain here and give a gentle ESH, specifically for involving your niece in your reaction. Had you only had the conversation with your sister, I would have said NTA. She's being a terrible parent and not talking responsibility for her kid. \n\nYour issue and anger are legit and you've gotta protect your home, but you may have made your niece's issues worse, when you could have just taken your sister aside to draw the same boundary. To me, not taking the compassionate route for the benefit of a child, especially when the kid's shittiness is caused by abuse, is being an AH.\n\nEDIT: Needed fewer words to make my point", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It's also possible they're being given strategies or homework that they aren't doing because your sister is babying her. If the therapist isn't giving any, consider maybe they need a new one beyond just talk therapy. Sounds like their family has been through some real hardships. Maybe having a conversation with them BOTH about the issues, consequences, and underlying issues could be helpful, because it sounds like you are about them but not at the expense of your own family. NTA.", ">my sister's ex husband is a piece of work and often got on my nieces case about food\n\nIt sounds like the ex-husband deliberately starved this girl? And that's where her anxiety is coming from? So yeah, that's going to need more than 3 months to heal from. Honestly, it sounds like you should ask your sister for the contact details of the therapist so you can ask the therapist for their professional opinion on how you can navigate this situation so your kids aren't inconvenienced every time they grab a snack. I'm sure the therapist may be able to suggest something that circumvents this situation. And obviously talk to your sister about what her plan and timeline is for staying and leaving.\n\nNAH because your sister and niece sound traumatised and like they are trying to the best of their abilities, they are still developing their coping abilities at the moment", "Whether it's from her background or her mother babying her, she's clearly not acting appropriately for her age regarding food.", "INFO: has she been evaluated for Prader-Willi syndrome? https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/prader-willi-syndrome/symptoms-causes/syc-20355997", "So what your niece is going through is very common with kids who are food insecure. Your sister has to be proactive in dealing with the behaviour. What does her therapist say she should be doing when this occurs?

Your neice among other things has a massive anxiety disorder and how her guardians handle it is going to make the biggest difference. People are making what sound like good suggestions (separate snack drawer) but with such strong obsession and fear I'm not sure that's the solution either. Are you in a position to consult with someone who has ample experience with child abuse and food hoarding who might be able to mediate/advise?", "NTA\n\nwhat does your sis mean by \u201cshe wont be like this forever\u201d, are they planning to stay with u guys forever? \n\nAnd thats a pretty good solution, if her child wants more snacks and wants to hoard them then her mom can provide them for her.

Call or send an email to the niece's therapist explaining the situation and expressing your concerns.  The therapist may not know about this behavior.

Her therapist needs to be made aware of her behavior about this situation.", "NTA", "NTA.\nAs someone who suffers from food insecurities (to the point your niece is at), you're not the AH. Your niece hasn't, yet, figured out that you're not about to snatch her food away. She's afraid.\nHowever, it's not sustainable. She can't scream every time someone else gets a snack, and one way to ensure that is getting her OWN snacks.\nThat way, any fear she has of being left without is handled. She won't be without because she has her own. \n\nThis is an incredibly difficult situation for all involved, and her mother is only an AH because she hasn't tried getting her child snacks before to try and mitigate this issue.", "NTA. Trauma or not, babying your soon-to-be-a-teen kid, letting them do and have whatever they want and never telling them no isn\u2019t healthy. The mom needs to join her daughter in therapy. Also, they\u2019ve definitely overstayed their welcome. There\u2019s only so much you and your family can and should put up with when you let family who\u2019re down on their luck live with you. From the sounds of it all your sister is doing is enabling her daughters disrespectful behaviour, is doing nothing to better their situation and doesn\u2019t see anything wrong with freeloading off of your family.

I doubt the therapist would suggest handling this behavior in this manner.", "NAH because your sister and niece sound traumatised and like they are trying to the best of their abilities, they are still developing their coping abilities at the moment", "I imagine the sister feels guilt for allowing her child to have been in such a household that these food issues are so deep rooted now. But yes, she isn't helping her at all (especially as she's about to head into her teens where habits will be harder to break and food is a major part of socialising). I hope this kid really is in therapy.", "Yep, it's a shame but the OP definitely needs to step in here before his own children end up with food issues.", "I don\u2019t think it\u2019s about acting her age because most kids don\u2019t ever have these kinds of insecurities regarding food, no matter the age. I think ur take is pretty harsh on the daughter, when it\u2019s her mum that is the problem. Her mum needs to get her daughter therapy asap.

They don\u2019t accept boundaries already in place, what makes you think the neice will not take the others?", "Great idea. I would also ask to speak with the therapist as a household to find out the best way to handle this and what advice they have because it seems like SIL is not following through with advice from the therapist. At the very least it would offer insight into how best to handle this.", "I feel like this would help. Knowing for sure she has x amount guaranteed no one else can touch might be the measure of control needed for her to stop obsessing about other people's snacking.", "This! I feel really bad for the sister and niece, but you have to do what's best for your family, and what's best is getting them out of there.", "Or they give you emergency food stamps that aren't part of the regular cycle.", "This. Normally, they do. Especially with a child involved in need of food. Unless there is 'help' with someone feeding them. You can't ever admit that, or they will drag their heels until welcome is worn out and they are left with no food at all. Then they will drag it out some more, claiming that the help will come back and it's their own fault for any reason they can dream up. Noting it sounds like she already has her 100% of the time. Child support/custody can always be changed on paperwork later. So something is afoot here somewhere. \n\nNTA", "This should absolutely be the top comment.

It doesn't make how the situation is being handled okay, and I agree that OP is NTA, but there's no need to devolve into overt cruelty by calling an abused, traumatized child \"spoiled\" for something that's out of her control.", "The nieces behavior can and probably will give OPs kids food issues as well though. So it definitely needs to be nipped in the bud", "I am pretty convinced what niece's mom does goes completely against the therapist's advice.", "She has been in therapy for months", "The post repeatedly says she's in therapy already.", "I think at 12 she ought to understand the consequences of doing that. I would hope having her own supply would satisfy her control craving.", "OP could put locks on them, or on a larger cupboard for his kids, and a separate cabinet for sister and niece.", "Isn't this kind of the same as what OP has now suggested?  OP is already being very generous I don't think asking her sis to buy their own snacks so there's no question of who gets what is asking too much, better than OP still buying all the snacks and having to just divvy them equally including for her two kids, I imagine *her* kids could then take on an unhealthy hoarding mentality as well no thanks", "You don't until you try, and enforce consequences. Sitting down as a family and discussing the best way forward, with the suggestions made here, as an attempt to settle the matter is probably the best way. And not as extreme as the people suggesting he evicts his sister and niece, knowing the trauma and financial issues they already are suffering from.", "Exactly! They don't say.. oh you have no money for food but, just make do. No, they'd issue some then figure out how to claw back overpayment if they weren't entitled  to them.", "So, either sister is hiding her foodstamps from the family or she told the county that her family will help her no matter what. It might be time to ask for the paperwork from the county or issue sister dear eviction paperwork.", "Thanks", "I \ud83d\udcaf  believe you are being fed a line of bs about the foodstamps.

It takes time to find the right therapist. The fact there is no mention of steps to create a safe food environment for the kid: box of snacks just for her so she knows she won\u2019t go hungry, a shelf on the fridge of things just for her she can access. Writing her name on some of the food etc. there are ways to deal with this. I say this as an adult who had to deal with the same issues in therapy as I grew up in a rough situation. Therapy isn\u2019t just a go and your fixed situation.", "I saw this but am wondering if the therapist knows about the food hoarding.

I've helped many a single mom with full care of kid/s get foodstamps with custody/child support a complete toss up. I always tell them that help from anyone isn't a permanent thing and to not mention it if possible. Otherwise, it is x amount of help/meals for x amount of time. Or just once because FS can be expedited in about a week.\n\nSomething got said that caused them to be delayed so long. She could have even said she has 0 bills (free place to live) but makes okayish money for being Bill free. Causing her to be denied completely", "Right! I know here FS can be approved nearly same day or within 3 days at the most. Custody/ child support  is sometimes a very, very long and drawn out thing to get. I'd bet the money in my account  she's either hiding them from her family or she lied to the county", "The mother is incapable of handling that responsibility right now, so OP's family is in the position of needing to lend a helping hand", "Not incapable  just chosing NOT to parent.", "That\u2019s because this is a judgement sub, not an advice sub", "Being an asshole is more complex than just being right or wrong, assholery transcends that."]}
