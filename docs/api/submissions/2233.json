And 29M does not talk to 27F and if anyone is curious 22F did go to zoo with her kid she left when 56F went to the backyard.

Mind your business and do not start believing that 27 is innocent.", "YTA. Yelling at  the 22F IS taking sides. My mom doing this exact thing, being enmeshed with my sister and the constant triangulation and drama is exactly why I went NC with both she AND my younger sister.

Clearly there is beef that you don't know about because it has nothing to do with you. You don't know who did what to whom, and instead of asking either of your children calmly and with an eye toward mediation, you're just yelling at the younger one.

Instead you screamed at her asking what that hell was wrong with her & immediately jumped to if you don\u2019t take 27 with you then you can\u2019t go either. No wonder she stayed in her room & quit talking to you too, by jumping on her like that you blatantly favored 27 without even hearing her side & I\u2019m sure from how you e written here that that\u2019s absolutely not the first time you\u2019ve done this. \n\nYou all need to learn how to communicate with each other bc silent treatments & taking sides without any information at all sure as hell isn\u2019t the answer.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Now you corrected me. We\u2019re square.", "If it\u2019s the OPs house & they\u2019re telling the person who lives there to stop\nacting like an ass, and they refuse,  they absolutely have a right to say something. It\u2019s THEIR house.", "Tell me, as you keep commenting on every single thing I\u2019m saying & trying to stir up shit.", "Siuuuure you are\u2026 22f.", "I always find responses like yours hilarious. If you can't make your point without insulting the person you're talking to, then you don't have a point. If you need to call names to get your point across, then your \"point\" clearly isn't good enough to stand by itself. \n\nFunny enough, I AM an adult and parent living with my parents. And we actually treat each other LIKE ADULTS! We split everything 50/50 (much like roommates), and don't unnecessarily stick our noses in each other's personal business. The only way they \"make mine and my child's lives easier\" is.... being roommates who split the bills.  I know it's a novel concept to you.", "The only person acting like an ass in this situation is the OP.\nBut since at least half of her adult children are still living at home, I assume she\u2019s probably not mom of the year.", "I fucking wish I was 22 again omfg. I\u2019d do so much different", "No insults, just called out behaviors. It\u2019s not my fault that you don\u2019t like having your own behaviors put in your face. You\u2019re the one who acted like that, not me. \n\nAlso, you choosing to ignore the glaringly obvious point of you not respecting the rules/wishes of the people let you stay in THEIR house (as in not your house & you don\u2019t pay for it), because you don\u2019t like the smell of your own\u2026 foot odor, doesn\u2019t mean there is no point. There is, you just choose to ignore it, as it\u2019s an inconvenient truth for you. \n\nYou can also stop the pretense that you\u2019re not the person in question. It\u2019s glaringly obvious. Also, the much like roommates, isn\u2019t roommates, as it\u2019s not your place.", "Sure sure.", "I\u2019m just imaging you sipping your big gulp typing like Kermit the frog, foaming at the mouth thinking how superior your brain is to everyone else\u2019s. I\u2019d love to comment more but I have a life unlike someone who\u2019s so desperate to be a top.", "Hun, read your posts again. Definitely extremely insulting to me personally for some reason. How am I up for judgement at all right now? Again, living in someone's house doesn't mean you owe them compete control of your life. Sorry that for some reason that's hard for you to hear. And, fun fact, we have a written up lease. You have zero idea wth you're talking about.", "\ud83d\ude02. That\u2019s the best you\u2019ve got?\ud83d\ude02. No wonder your parents grounded you from going to the zoo. \ud83d\ude02.", "Poor baby. I'm sorry you kids don't talk to you after all your \"help\"", "You had a boring day, didn't you? No homework due tomorrow? And before you accuse, I'm actually the youngest son, just biding my time until I move out. You're doing a good job acting like a stern male father figure though...my house, my rules!...now start practicing the pity party when you have to pretend to not know why none of us will talk to either parent."]}
