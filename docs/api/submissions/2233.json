Clearly there is beef that you don't know about because it has nothing to do with you. You don't know who did what to whom, and instead of asking either of your children calmly and with an eye toward mediation, you're just yelling at the younger one.

Instead you screamed at her asking what that hell was wrong with her & immediately jumped to if you don\u2019t take 27 with you then you can\u2019t go either. No wonder she stayed in her room & quit talking to you too, by jumping on her like that you blatantly favored 27 without even hearing her side & I\u2019m sure from how you e written here that that\u2019s absolutely not the first time you\u2019ve done this. \n\nYou all need to learn how to communicate with each other bc silent treatments & taking sides without any information at all sure as hell isn\u2019t the answer.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Being an adult means communicating effectively and respecting other adults' autonomy. If OP was upset over the situation in her own home, there were dozens of more effective ways of dealing with the situation. Here she did not ask either daughter what the problem was, did not approach either of them before, during, or after for clarification, and attempted to insert herself into a situation and made a sweeping decision that did not even address the problem that OP had with her daughters. That would not be good or effective parenting even if we were discussing *children* having an interpersonal problem. Stomping your foot and demanding the desired outcome you want is something I associate more with toddlers who haven't learned to communicate or effectively manage their feelings, not a 50 some year old mother. So, yes, that is bar-none, with no further context an AH move, *even if younger daughter has a petty motive*.\n\nNow, moving on from there, refusing to engage with someone can be petty, yes. It also can be an effective way to manage dealing with someone that you have interpersonal conflict with, *but have to deal with* for whatever reason. Sometimes, as adults, we are in situations where we have to find ways to deal with people we dislike, and refusing to engage, greyrocking, etc can actually be helpful tools for those of us who have to deal with anywhere from annoying to downright abusive people. Is it unpleasant? Sure, but it is a more pleasant and mature alternative than what OP demanded, or can expect if she unilaterally inserts herself into conflicts and arbitrarily decides who is in the wrong. \n\nMaybe younger daughter is upset for a petty, immature reason, but I find it rather telling that, despite her daughter's behavior bothering her over a period of time, she never bothered or cared to ask either daughter what was happening. Maybe that commenter is OP's son, and that indicates OP *does know* in that case and *knows* that providing any actual context would firmly paint her in a AH light.", "Oh that side knows that's why the shrug and no comment. That's standard for I fucked up but I'm not telling what I did because I was wrong", "Lol 3 giant leaps there.\n\n> It's 100% always immature. \n\nNo its not. What is immature is two people constantly screaming at each other. If it's a choice between that and giving the silent treatment, then silent treatment is the more mature choice. The most mature choice is talking it out, but both sides have to be willing and that's not always the case.\n\nLuckily, as I said, it's irrelevant to this judgment so we don't need to know, as its none of OPs business. \n\nThough to be fair if they were screaming the house down it would have been OPs business, but they aren't, so it isn't.\n\n> Seems as in this case one side doesn't know why they are fighting.\n\nLiterally just you assuming. Equally likely the 27 year old knows exactly why. The fact OP doesn't know is immaterial, because its nothing to do with her.\n\n> In a few years the 22 year old will be doing it to their kid too as punishment \n\nPure speculation to make yourself sound more correct in saying stopping talking to someone is immature in every single circumstance.", "At this point I\u2019d expect **all** but the son to move out.", "LOL.
