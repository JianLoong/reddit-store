My laptop couldn\u2019t handle it and my (m39) girlfriend (f35) Pola has a really good gaming laptop (she doesn\u2019t play games though) and I asked her if I could come over and used it (we don\u2019t live together). She was generous and agreed.\n\nYou should know that she likes crappy movies and tv shows. Whenever I ask her about something she\u2019s watching and if it\u2019s good, she\u2019ll often reply \u2018no, but I still love it.\u2019\n\nWhen I was gaming, I noticed one folder which interested me. It had her movies and show episodes there. Shockingly, it was all downloaded, pirated. I know she pays for newer movies but these were like obscure 90s/00s shows barely anyone heard about. I remembered one or two I watched as a kid.\n\nHonestly, it\u2019s really not okay to pirate movies and steal someone\u2019s work. I got really annoyed with her (I am a small time content creator so I know how it hurts to have your works stolen). I deleted all of it and after I was done gaming, I told her about this.\n\nShe called me a massive asshole. I said that what she was doing was illegal and she shouldn\u2019t have done it.\n\nShe replied that she wouldn\u2019t if those things were easily available. Apparently, they\u2019re almost impossible to find and it took her ages to track them down. She explained that for some shows, she was only able to find a really bad original version in English but a good one in French so she edited out the audio so it was good English version. She said another was incredibly difficult to find because the studio lost all the copies in a fire.\n\nI told her it didn\u2019t matter because it was still illegal and if it\u2019s not possible to find it legally, perhaps she\u2019s not meant to have it. And it\u2019s not a loss if only a small number of people remember the show anyway. She said, she\u2019s doing it because she loves those shows and she wants to have them.\n\nShe told me she put in a lot of work and I said it\u2019s her own fault to work on something so illegal. She told me to fuck off a.d called me an asshole\n\nI said at least now, she won\u2019t have to worry because it\u2019s all gone. She laughed at me and told me I was stupid if I thought it was her only copy after all the work she put in it. I asked her to delete it because what she was doing wasn\u2019t okay.\n\nShe was really mean. She laughed at me, told me that was not going to happen and asked me for my keys.\n\nI asked why and she said she had to think and told me she\u2019d call me.  It\u2019s bee a few days and I haven\u2019t heard from her.\n\nI told my mates about this and they\u2019re split. Some agree with me but said I shouldn\u2019t have deleted it others told me that she was doing a good thing by preserving the media from being lost. I said if it\u2019s so bad no one likes it, maybe it\u2019s best it\u2019s lost but they still took her side.\n\nSince they\u2019re split, I worry that maybe by deleting it, I was the asshole but my consciousness doesn\u2019t agree. Was I the asshole?\n\nEdit: it wasn\u2019t lost because she has everything on her disc apparently. She so politely called me an idiot for thinking it was the only place she had them", "created_utc": 1684249393, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13j7px3/aita_for_getting_rid_off_my_girlfriends_movie/", "score": 48, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

But I'd guess if I could talk to you long enough I'd find other areas where you don't disapprove of people doing something illegal (drinking while underage for example, or smoking pot). I doubt you go around pointing out every single illegal thing other people do. So yr prob a hypocrite in some way.\n\nAlso, it doesn't really address the issue of illegal downloads, which is rampant worldwide. Why choose to be such a busybody w/her, deleting her stuff?\n\nYou should've talked to her about it instead, pointed out why you think it's wrong. She likely would've disagreed, but you might still be a couple. By deleting her stuff you understandably made her mad. And she prob feels she can't trust you. Wouldn't be surprised if yr relationship is now over.", "YTA. Unbelievably so. Some writers give away their older works so everyone can enjoy them.

Do your fingers itch so much that you want to keep prying on others stuff? \n\nPiracy is a problem sure but for old movies and shows especially, if the director is alive, they'll probably thank the person who pirated the film and uploaded it online - for making it available to everybody.\n\nIf James Cameron had made some obscure short film in his early days and somehow lost it, someone uploading it online would be a great favour for him and every cine buff. \n\nYou've no idea about films so why not stick to playing games that your crappy laptop can handle.", "YTA\n\nReally?", "I hope you're joking because otherwise I feel very sorry for any of your potential partners  (I assume your gf dumps you soon).\n\nYTA.", "Your username is appropriately grandiose.

It's still illegal but I'd it doesn't exist anywhere else anyway, no one is making a profit on it anymore whether it's pirated or not.\n\nNo one actually gets pinched for this unless you can prove dissemination for profit. What she did is the equivalent of my parents old vhs collection of shit they taped off cable. Illegal? Yes. Does anyone care? No, because it was for private use and no one sold it.

My laptop couldn\u2019t handle it and my (m39) girlfriend (f35) Pola has a really good gaming laptop (she doesn\u2019t play games though) and I asked her if I could come over and used it (we don\u2019t live together). She was generous and agreed.\n\nYou should know that she likes crappy movies and tv shows. Whenever I ask her about something she\u2019s watching and if it\u2019s good, she\u2019ll often reply \u2018no, but I still love it.\u2019\n\nWhen I was gaming, I noticed one folder which interested me. It had her movies and show episodes there. Shockingly, it was all downloaded, pirated. I know she pays for newer movies but these were like obscure 90s/00s shows barely anyone heard about. I remembered one or two I watched as a kid.\n\nHonestly, it\u2019s really not okay to pirate movies and steal someone\u2019s work. I got really annoyed with her (I am a small time content creator so I know how it hurts to have your works stolen). I deleted all of it and after I was done gaming, I told her about this.\n\nShe called me a massive asshole. I said that what she was doing was illegal and she shouldn\u2019t have done it.\n\nShe replied that she wouldn\u2019t if those things were easily available. Apparently, they\u2019re almost impossible to find and it took her ages to track them down. She explained that for some shows, she was only able to find a really bad original version in English but a good one in French so she edited out the audio so it was good English version. She said another was incredibly difficult to find because the studio lost all the copies in a fire.\n\nI told her it didn\u2019t matter because it was still illegal and if it\u2019s not possible to find it legally, perhaps she\u2019s not meant to have it. And it\u2019s not a loss if only a small number of people remember the show anyway. She said, she\u2019s doing it because she loves those shows and she wants to have them.\n\nShe told me she put in a lot of work and I said it\u2019s her own fault to work on something so illegal. She told me to fuck off a.d called me an asshole\n\nI said at least now, she won\u2019t have to worry because it\u2019s all gone. She laughed at me and told me I was stupid if I thought it was her only copy after all the work she put in it. I asked her to delete it because what she was doing wasn\u2019t okay.\n\nShe was really mean. She laughed at me, told me that was not going to happen and asked me for my keys.\n\nI asked why and she said she had to think and told me she\u2019d call me.  It\u2019s bee a few days and I haven\u2019t heard from her.\n\nI told my mates about this and they\u2019re split. Some agree with me but said I shouldn\u2019t have deleted it others told me that she was doing a good thing by preserving the media from being lost. I said if it\u2019s so bad no one likes it, maybe it\u2019s best it\u2019s lost but they still took her side.\n\nSince they\u2019re split, I worry that maybe by deleting it, I was the asshole but my consciousness doesn\u2019t agree. Was I the asshole?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Looking at anything else is an invasion of her privacy and a giant betrayal. Then you passed judgment on her content. And to top it all off, you destroyed her private property. Regardless of how it was obtained, it was her property. Without so much as a word of discussion, you deleted her files. Who died and made you the king? You had absolutely no right to do what you did.
