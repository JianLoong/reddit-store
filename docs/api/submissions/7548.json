You have your own life, and your own responsibilities, you respect her life choices and she should be respecting yours. She made her own decisions, don\u2019t feel bad about not helping out", "NTA\n\nWhile it's sad that it led to you and your sister not talking, she and her BF had not 1, but 2 children before they were 20. Like you said, their choice to have kids isn't your business, but the way you spend YOUR time is and you absolutely have that choice.", "NTA, the first kid could've being an accident, but the second is apparently not, they are either too stupid to use protection or too stupid to calmly assess their situation. In any case, you don't own them any childcare.", "NAH. I mean this is tough, you're not doing anything wrong and no you shouldn't have to look after their kids but this is the mental health of your sister, maybe give her a break every once in a while and bond with your neice a bit? Even if you just watch them for an hour or two every once in a while so she can have just a moment of peace. No you have no obligation to do that but it would be a nice thing to do", "NTA.

It's not your job to provide free childcare, fine, but you're prioritising your free time over your sister's wellbeing. Do you have that right? Yes. Will that attitude alienate the people close to you? Also yes.\n\nYour sister made her choices, and from what you say she's been working her ass off ever since. She hasn't dumped the kids with your parents so she can go out partying, and she hasn't run the family into the ground by trying to go it alone. Asking for help when you're struggling is the responsible thing to do, and that's what she's doing. Judging her after the fact isn't going to change the fact that those kids are here and she's exhausted. That's the situation right now, and if you want to be a part of her life, that's the reality you need to engage with. You don't have to of course - you can choose to isolate yourself from her and not deal with any of it. Again, you have that right. But you won't have a relationship with your sister. That's the choice you're making.", "INFO: You express concern for protecting your limited free time.

She asked these children's uncle to watch them (and maybe develop a relationship with them). That doesn't make her an AH.\n\nYou're NTA for saying no, but it really is on you that you don't talk anymore. Her children are her focus, and you want no part of them. So, you have pulled away from her family. That's your right, but it is sad. She made decisions that make her life harder (and so did the father). But in everything you describe they are living up to those challenges. You may very well regret not having a relationship with your sister and her family later.", "NTA. I am overwhelming surprised at the number of family members that EXPECT free childcare from family members. I am a grandmother who has raised her children. When I watch my grandchildren I want it to be from the heart not an expectation set by my children.

Not for refusing to babysit, which is fair enough.

It\u2019s not your responsibility to offer childcare to your sister but it\u2019s also not your responsibility to teach her \u201cthe error of her ways\u201d. \n\nA little bit of kindness and empathy towards a sibling would take no effort on your part here. A simple \u201cI\u2019m sorry you\u2019re feeling stressed but I don\u2019t want to set a precedent that I\u2019ll watch your kids, because I\u2019m not comfortable with that.

It appears that both parents are working hard and accept the choices they have made. It wouldn't kill you to take the kids for a walk in their stroller for an hour if you weren't busy.

Are you spiteful about the age she got pregnant? You have two niece/nephews who are your family and you won\u2019t mind them at all?\n\nIs she asking you to mind them regularly on a schedule in replacement of paid childcare?

They are her children and ultimately her problem. However, you might consider helping her out occasionally. It is hard to be a Mom to small children and it sounds like she is trying her best. I remember how hard it was for me as a young mother and how incredibly grateful I was for any help I could get. She is your sister and you (presumably) love her. I believe that family helps each other, even if the person in question may not necessarily deserve it.", "YTA, not for refusing to babysit, but for the comment you made to your sister about her having kids \"not being your fault\".\n\nNot wanting to babysit doesn't make anyone an asshole. Maybe you really dislike children, maybe you think babysitting is too much responsibility, maybe you just don't have time right now. Or maybe your sister asks you to watch them for hours every other day and it's just too much for you. All of this is fine, and you could've told your sister so.\n\n*However,*  your post comes off very much like you don't want to do it because she had children so young, and you feel like her having to take care of them 24/7 is her punishment. You're supposed to help your family and friends when they're struggling, but you seem to think that your sister's life choices make her less eligible for your sympathy and help.\n\nEven if it's just that you don't want to babysit any children in general, there was absolutely no need for you to make that comment to your sister.

Like  I get it. She  got pregnant super early TWICE and now she is asking you to help with the kids, even if they are her responsibility. But it's not like she is partying or antything. She is asking you for help beacuse she is exhausted which is completly understandable with 2 small kids, job and college", "NTA for refusing child care.

Alls she asked was for you to watch them while she had a nap. No, of course you don\u2019t have to watch them but you act like that because she got pregnant young she deserves to struggle and no one should give her a break. Yeah it was kinda dumb to have kids that early but she is doing absolutely everything right. She\u2019s putting the kids first, study and working to provide.

But for \u201cwhatever reason\u201d they chose not to abort.

I get sometimes we all need help but at the same people need to learn to that if you are going to start having sex , protected or not, things can happen. So it\u2019s better to at least be prepared for situations like that. Meaning, if you feel mature enough for sex you have be mature enough to handle everything that comes along with it. And when planning you have to plan as if you are the only one taking care of the child because anything can happen. Parents can die, so expected help from grandma and grandpa might not come through. You can\u2019t plan on having a relative babysit, cause it\u2019s not their child and they have a life so why should their lives be impacted by your decisions to have sex. I encourage everyone who is child free and having sex to start planning like you are about to enter single motherhood. The father could leave at the drop of a feather and your family may not want to be help in a situation they believe wasn\u2019t their fault. So I feel it\u2019s better to plan like that then to not plan, have oops babies, and expect family members to help out in any capacity", "Why not help her out though? \n\nThose two-three hours for her can really mean the world.

She can ask for childcare, he can say no.  \n\n\nIt's possible to have loving familial relationships and also not consider ourselves responsible every need our family members might have.", "All of the above.", "I was running out of room, but what me and our parents have basically planned out with them is this. In five years things will change quickly, the oldest will start regular school, their degrees will let them work one full time job instead of three part times. And I'll hopefully have enough time and my own place to watch them once in a blue moon. And even then they'll be 24, not ancient. By the time they're 30 they'll have a lot more free time, and still be young enough to enjoy life.", "Uncle, but yeah.", "OP can decide what he wants to spend his time on, then be it 2 mins or 2 hours. NTA.", "Yeah, OP is really judgy.", "Thank you", "Then I\u2019m going with NTA. You have to maintain your well-being. I get that your sister needs a break but you can\u2019t be the one to give it to her.", "You live with your sister and her children. You\u2019re going to have to have conversations with her occasionally. Being polite takes the same amount of time as being rude. \n\nBut aside from that, there\u2019s no need to bring her age or the circumstances of her children\u2019s conception into it at all, especially as you\u2019ve clarified elsewhere that that\u2019s not *why* you don\u2019t want to babysit. That\u2019s just being harsh about a sensitive topic to be hurtful so your sister won\u2019t speak to you and take up your free time.\n\nMake it clear that you will never voluntarily babysit, but why would you make it out to be a judgement of her lifestyle and choices if it isn\u2019t?", "Gotta go soft YTA then I'm afraid. You live together, she's your sister and you make no mention of any bad blood between you before this. I understand you're busy and value your free time, as do we all. No one is expecting you to arrange activities and a teaching plan. The kind thing to do is bundle your sister out of the house for an hour to grab a coffee - even during nap time. You can read, watch a show. As long as the kids are breathing, it's not gonna harm them to even sit in a dirty nappy while their mum is out", "So your \"hang up\" is simply that you don't want to help because it isn't your problem.\n\nFair enough.", "Damn! You won't even give her a nap. Harsh.", "You're just so judgemental about them. No need for that.", "[deleted]", "Who are you to make that decision? I had 2 by the time I was 21 and I'm a great mum. Loved having the energy to deal with young'uns.", "If you won't help your sister while she takes a shower, then yes, YTA. There are simple requests that one can help with because it's the decent thing to do. Someday you may have a request of your sister (ex. picking you up some food) and she should say no. She should tell you that it's not her problem that you're hungry. You should have planned better.", "It's not about \"enjoying life\". It's about having a few hours of downtime so you don't lose your mind.\n\nLike I said. It's totally up to you.", "Sorry Dude. Missed that! It is 3:24 a.m\n the cats had zoomies and trying to fall back asleep with reddit stories.", "Yeah. One of the comments below asked if she was asking for time to go out, or just time to take a shower and do some self care and OP said it was the latter. He won't even watch the kids long enough for his sister to get a shower. He said he doesn't see why he should be \"punished\" for his sister's choices. It's not the refusal, it's the attitude.", "While I agree with your points for any normal question, this is Reddit and guaranteed people would be hounding for information not provided. Why didn't you put their age? Wait two kids?? Are they twins, how old did she have them? Were they planned? I still agree completely with your assessment, but including unnecessary information on here is often necessary and of OP is a regular by any means he probably knew that.", "Not providing childcare does not make OP the asshole", "Yeah our relationship was great actually, it just kinda fell off a cliff along with her free time. I just don't want to be punished for her decisions.", "Do you... have children? I cherish people who want to babysit my children but those who don't are in no way the AH for not doing it. Yeah, children are exhausting, but I made the choice to have kids and my friends and family did not.", "Not his problem \ud83d\ude44", "I can't do that I work 2 12's on the weekends.", "All good.", "He also reckons the children came '10 years early'.", "I was referring to the fact that OP said to sister explicitly that it wasn\u2019t his fault she had two kids so young in his account. Unnecessary thing to say to his sister, not an unnecessary detail to add to the story.", "Exactly! Maybe if it was 1 kid I'd say ok maybe 1x every few months watch the kid so she gets a break but she had another after struggling. OP isn't obligated to babysit", "Watching the kids for an hour is not punishment. It is a kind gesture. NTA for not wanting to I guess, but you are definitely selfish. Also, one day you may have children of your own and need some help with childcare. Every parent does at some point regardless of age, education, etc. Guess who will not be helping ?", "Why is watching your niblings for an hour punishment? Does it actually hurt you in any way?", "[deleted]", "As the parent of two small children (who is much older and financially solvent than OP's sister) - punishment is not that far off the mark. Small children are fucking exhausting. Don't get me wrong, I love my children and wanted to have them (and accept the exhaustion they entail) but absolutely no one other than me and my husband is obligated to accept caring for them.  \n\n\nI'm not sure if all the people saying OP is the AH have very rose tinted glasses about children, or they're the type of people who wouldn't think twice about dumping their children on an unsuspecting victim.", "It reduces my already limited free time.", "That's not a bad idea, I'll ask. To give you an idea of my schedule I'm gone for school M-F 9-4, I work 2 12's the weekends, and usually pick up one night shift a week.", "Idk why but it seems to be the later option", "Don\u2019t do it period!!! You got things going on in your life and you aren\u2019t responsible for it.. if you have the time sure that\u2019s nice but you don\u2019t have to find a solution for her.", "[deleted]", "I'll try but reddit keeps taking down my accounts, so no promises."]}
