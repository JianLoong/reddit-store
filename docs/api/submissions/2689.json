I doubt it is from an earned allowance by the way the parents reacted to her doing laundry. If it is an allowance then it is probably unearned which means she doesn't understand the value of it. She'll spend it then ask the parents for more because of the \"unfairness\" of the step mom. Where is the lesson? If the money is from a birthday or special occasion then I don't believe it should be taken as a available money. It was a gift. If that gift had been an object it wouldn't be in this discussion as taking away objects and/or privileges wasn't part of the punishment. Now if the young girl earns thee money in some way then I think she should pay for the laundry. However I don't think that is the case here based on the reactions of the child and the adults in this situation.\nIf the girl has no concept of the value of  money and the parents are unsupportive then I see no lesson to learn. Just an angry girl and a frustrated step mom.\nChildren cause extra expenses all the time. They are children. They are learning and will make mistakes if not taught. However the costs need to be something they can understand. \nA girl her age does understand time. How much time school cost her. How much time homework costs her. How much time she has left over for her hobbies and friends. Sleeping in on the weekends. Time is a concept we teach our children without thinking too much. She will understand the lost time to do this laundry as she will know what she lost to do it. As she does the laundry she'll think about the friends she was going to see, the shoes she was going to watch, the hobbies she would have done, etc. She'll learn to do laundry and how much time she lost with the extra clean laundry she washed \n\nI don't believe a one time laundry day will fix this though. Especially is the parents don't support it. The real problem is the girl isn't learning household chores and the parents aren't supporting the step parent. This dynamic isn't going to change by the step mom forcing a day of laundry on her. \n\nI have a 7 year old that helps with laundry. The punishment is perfect but needs to be repeated until she sees the value of the lost time. If I only put dirty laundry in the basket then I will only have one load to wash/dry/fold vs multiple.

You\u2019re teaching her respect and responsibility.", "NTA, showing her WHY she should fold her clothes back up is a very valuable life skill lesson that her parents haven't bothered to teach her.", "NTA she needs to learn responsibility, but more so she needs to learn how much extra work her laziness causes. Her parents can either convince her to do what she should or do her laundry themselves.", "OP, if I were you, I'd stop doing her laundry. Tell her parents that if they don't mind what she's doing, then they can deal with the consequences of it.", "This sounds perfectly reasonable to me. When my oldest son decided that he couldn't be bothered to put away the laundry that I did for him, I decided that it was time for him to do his own laundry.\n\nNTA", "At 9 my oldest decided she didn't like the way I was folding her clothes and demanded to be taught how to do her own laundry.", "It may then be that the excessive cleanliness is a result of being around adults who are drug users. She can't control anything but can keep her space and items as clean as possible.", "And OP is on here about laundry punishments?  Jesus.", "Never said they were", "On the one hand, shit's fucked up all round.\n\nBut on the other hand ... If I were on drugs, dating a guy on drugs, and had a kid dashing their clean clothes in the wash, after my piss poor choices lead to a change of washing venue. I'd probably be a bit miffed and not act accordingly, then think it was a good idea to bring this shit online.\n\nI don't usually condone it. But I hope somebody can DOX OP and send CPS their way.", "Yeah.  Having done amphetamines regularly (for brief periods of time) this absolutely tracks, lol.", "NTA. Exactly the right consequences of her actions", "Nta", "NTA. Seems bang on the money to me. If her parents have an issue, go on strike and refuse to do any of her laundry.", "NTA\n\nThis is what we call learning and accountability!", "NTA. It's a completely appropriate punishment. The key with this type of situation is to lay out the punishment seriously, but then make it as pleasant as possible while actually doing it instead of staying angry the whole time. It becomes a bonding experience and an educational one rather than merely an antagonistic one. \n\nIt sounds like the situation with your partner is rough so it's probably extra important that you set good boundaries and parent the kid with some consistency.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nShe\u2019s knowingly creating more work, and it\u2019s time she got handed the responsibility for that work.", "This is how I got my kids to stop using a new towel every day. Turns out they hate having to do a load of just towels twice a week as much as I do!!! NTA", "The problem is that her parents and step parent are all active meth users. Read OP post history, the whole family is a mess.", "Redditors just *love* making accusations of bigotry when there's literally zero evidence supporting it.", "I also just realized how unhelpful my reply was lol sorry", "INFO: Can you elaborate on the meth usage?", "Get the fuck off of meth jackass", "NTA! My mom made me start doing my own laundry when I started changing my clothes a couple times a day ! I learned quickly to quit that !", "Or you could just  put the clothes on her bed for her to deal with - w/o washing or folding them again.", "NTA", "I even wonder if there's a past of neglect. A period where she was having to wear dirty clothes and got isolated/bullied at school and now has a paranoia surrounding dirty/smelly clothes.\n\n\nI know people get shit for making assumptions in this subreddit, but considering she continues to do it even after being punished, there's something else motivating the behaviour."]}
