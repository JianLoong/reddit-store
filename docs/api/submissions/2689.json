People don\u2019t place folded clothes in the hamper because *they touched the floor*.", "Wandering through OPs comment section it appears as though her husband is a meth user but still works etc. The BM in this case also disappeared for several years due to drugs when the kid was 4. There's a lot of possible reasons for the kid's behaviour and I highly doubt most of it is coming from school.", "Good thing step daughter is a girl and needs to learn how to be a proper wife! /s\n\nShe should be made to help out with the unnecessary laundry she's creating though.", "Literally no reason to be shitty with me.", "Or maybe she\u2019ll get to enjoy spending time with her step parent while learning constructively why her behaviour was inconsiderate as well as building a skill she\u2019ll need in adulthood? You\u2019re not wrong about not rewarding bad behaviour. But the suggestion wasn\u2019t to just go and get ice cream, it was to do it after doing laundry together. She\u2019s 9 years old, give her a break. Suggesting associating laundry and enjoyable moments with family rather than the arduous boring task many find it to be is a pretty sensible", "Seeing how OP has commented about using meth herself in the last 3 months, giving a 9 year old the silent treatment, etc., I feel worse and worse for this poor kid. Hopefully someone calls CPS sooner than later.", "This should be higher. There\u2019s a serious problem in this household and it\u2019s not the 9 year old.", "Even when I was reading the post I was wondering if there was more to this than just the kid misbehaving, like something OCD-like. Now, knowing she has two drug using parents and seeing the way OP talks about this kid, I\u2019m convinced that this kid is acting out due to her terrible home environment and upbringing.", ">Is this a \"I walked to school for hours in the snow and I was grateful that by year 3 my parents got me boots\" story ?\n\nIt isn't.\n\n>Because this is not as uplifting and sweet as you feel it is\n\nI don't feel that\n\n>I'm afraid\n\nI'm not sure what you're afraid of, but it's obviously not making assumptions about what I feel with nothing to go on. Please, don't judge me by your standards.", "Amen to that", "NTA, but don\u2019t make her pay. And while this is a consequence of her behavior, don\u2019t treat it like an all day punishment. Treat it as a learning opportunity and a chance for 1-on-1 time with her. Talk about school, talk about whatever stupid kid things she\u2019s into that adults never want to hear about. Even if she comes home thinking that laundry sucks, hopefully she\u2019ll think it wasn\u2019t a bad day because she got some quality time with you.", "YTA for how you talk about this poor kid, and using meth while having whatever custody arrangement you have about her.", "If it was your birth child I'd say do it.\n\nAs a step child it may or may not be appropriate depending on the situation.  There have been times when I had to parent my step child more softly than I would otherwise, because of other families stuff.  \n\nIf you are her main caregiver then go for it, but make sure you give her some love too.", "NTA!  Good job teaching responsibility and gratitude", "NTA. But it sounds like you shouldn't be doing her laundry, her loving parents who don't want you teaching lessons to their kid can deal with the behavior and it's outcomes.", "NTA \n\nHer laziness is costing you time and money. Making her accountable for her actions as well as teaching her responsibility should be supported.", "Out of this child's 3 parental figures you seem to be the only one with any idea what you're doing. NTA", "NTA\n\nI get why you you're doing it. Her parents should have a talk with her though and also, might want to get her checked, from the sound of it she might have OCD.", "NTA That is a wise punishment. She will learn the consequences of her actions. It\u2019s not like you\u2019re making her go alone. If they want to complain they can do all her laundry from now on. Pack it up and give it to them.", "NTA. This is exactly what I would do with my own daughter. She will try on clothes a few times before we go somewhere and just toss them in the hamper instead of putting them away and it's so irritating. If she doesn't learn the consequences now, you're not only letting her get away with it so she will continue doing it, but it will be a more difficult teaching moment if you wait until she's older and more stubborn.", "NTA. A nine year old can easily do all of those things. This is a good lesson, it teaches her what the chore is and fixes the problem without being mean. Good Job!", "Nta, but why are you the only parent that seems to care that she learns how to take care of herself. Maybe when she visits her mom's, you can have her bring her laundry or her dad can do it. Seriously though, nta", "Oh god, you are so NTA here. Anybody who has to use the laundromat to do laundry understands how egregious it is when someone is adding extra laundry for no reason! I think what you're doing is the perfect object lesson for your stepdaughter. When she realizes how much effort it is to wash those clothes she will change her ways.", "I\u2019m this person. If it\u2019s on the floor it\u2019s dirty. And I am the only one doing laundry. NTA.", "NTA, but since you're not her parent, it might be a good idea to turn this over to your spouse. Take the clean, folded laundry out of the hamper, and give it to your spouse, and tell them that they are responsible for dealing with it. You will not spend your time, energy, or money washing clean clothes..", "NTA. My son is 7 and he escorts me to the laundromat and helps me. Finds it enjoyable, actually. He still wastes clean clothes, but not as bad as he used to now.", "That's what I was thinking. At 9, she should be doing laundry with you on the regular. It's teaching lifeskills. Heck, my 6 year old can run a load of laundry already by himself.", "My mom would never let me wear jeans twice. I\u2019m learning so much today.", "The OCD thing was my first thought too. Looking at post history both bio-parents and OP have (maybe still are?) been meth users. Plus OP is a terrible step-parent, just based on her own comments about how she treats the kid.", "Yes they do.  My kids did it all the time.  The rule was,  bed covers pulled up and no clothes on the floor. They'd dump everything at the top of the drawer into the laundry basket until they got the item they were looking for. They'd leave it there and throw  their dirties on op. Then in two or three days present me with their full laundry basket for me to wash, dry, fold, put away. Nothing worked at stopping that until I made them do their own laundry", "It depends on where the money comes from. Where is this 9 year old getting the money? I doubt it is from an earned allowance by the way the parents reacted to her doing laundry. If it is an allowance then it is probably unearned which means she doesn't understand the value of it. She'll spend it then ask the parents for more because of the \"unfairness\" of the step mom. Where is the lesson? If the money is from a birthday or special occasion then I don't believe it should be taken as a available money. It was a gift. If that gift had been an object it wouldn't be in this discussion as taking away objects and/or privileges wasn't part of the punishment. Now if the young girl earns thee money in some way then I think she should pay for the laundry. However I don't think that is the case here based on the reactions of the child and the adults in this situation.\nIf the girl has no concept of the value of  money and the parents are unsupportive then I see no lesson to learn. Just an angry girl and a frustrated step mom.\nChildren cause extra expenses all the time. They are children. They are learning and will make mistakes if not taught. However the costs need to be something they can understand. \nA girl her age does understand time. How much time school cost her. How much time homework costs her. How much time she has left over for her hobbies and friends. Sleeping in on the weekends. Time is a concept we teach our children without thinking too much. She will understand the lost time to do this laundry as she will know what she lost to do it. As she does the laundry she'll think about the friends she was going to see, the shoes she was going to watch, the hobbies she would have done, etc. She'll learn to do laundry and how much time she lost with the extra clean laundry she washed \n\nI don't believe a one time laundry day will fix this though. Especially is the parents don't support it. The real problem is the girl isn't learning household chores and the parents aren't supporting the step parent. This dynamic isn't going to change by the step mom forcing a day of laundry on her. \n\nI have a 7 year old that helps with laundry. The punishment is perfect but needs to be repeated until she sees the value of the lost time. If I only put dirty laundry in the basket then I will only have one load to wash/dry/fold vs multiple. Better to put this away now.... Not a one time lesson. The lesson is useless if the parents don't support it.", "I just wanted to say I found it uplifting/sweet when you mentioned being able to get a comic sometimes."]}
