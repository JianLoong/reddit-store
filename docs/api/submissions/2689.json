Nine is a perfectly acceptable age to help around the house in addition to knowing better than creating more work.", "NTA I absolutely think that learning about the labour that goes into such chores is important, and that she should think twice about imposing more work on others. I agree with someone else on here. If her parent doesn\u2019t agree, then they can take on the chore and figure out a consequence (or not) that they feel is more appropriate. As a side note, at 9 she should be learning how to participate in family chores anyway.", "NTA. It's a fair, natural consequence. However, if her parents aren't down, don't go through with it. Instead, let them deal with her excessive laundry.", "Other than making her pay, NTA. Part of parenthood is teaching morals, manners and consider for other people. That's on your dime. But the visit itself is perfectly fine", "NTA. It\u2019s a fair punishment but if her parents aren\u2019t cool with it, then maybe your partner or whatever needs to step up and do their kids laundry.", "I wouldn\u2019t make a 9 year old pay for their own laundry or use this as a \u201cpunishment\u201d but there is nothing wrong with having the daughter go with you to the laundry mat and help with laundry in order to learn responsibility and contribute to the household. \nI wouldn\u2019t have it be just her laundry I would treat it more as a father/daughter bonding activity and maybe get Ice cream out or something. \nYou\u2019ll make a much bigger impact on her being nice than as a punishment.", "NTA. If she is going to create more work for you by trying on clothing, then immediately putting them in the soil bin and not putting them back on the hanger thats a pretty fair punishment and she will learn quick not to do that. And if they have an issue with that, then THEY can do her laundry and pay for the wash.", "NTA. Perfect parenting!", "NTA She is old enough to do her own laundry every week.  My kids were doing there own before that age.  This should not be a one time thing. There is nothing excessive about this punishment.  I wouldn\u2019t make her pay every week.\n\nIt is really odd how many people think her parents should teach her.  Um, a stepparent is a parent.  It is right there in the title.  If you want someone to be responsible for a child, you also let them have some authority.  Without it, this will not work.", "I don't know what my judgement is. \n\nOn one hand, OP is the one doing the laundry every week. They have a right to not want their work to go to waste. On the other, parents should be giving this lesson to the stepdaughter. \n\nA day spent doing laundry, isn't cruel and unusual punishment. If stepdaughter spends the day doing her own laundry, maybe she will learn to value the work that goes into making them become clean. Not waste that effort, no matter who does it.", "nta but if her parents think you are then they can do her laundry not u. let\u2019s see how they feel bout cleaning her clean clothes when THEY r the ones washing. \n\nn if they don\u2019t want you to parent their kid then you shouldn\u2019t be washing her clothes. they should do it.", "YTA if you force her to do this as punishment, especially if her parents are against it.\n\nInstead stop doing her laundry. Her dad can do it or he can teach her to do it. \n\nWhenever you are not being respected, just stop. She has two parents that are responsible for her.

Yes, she needs to be disciplined for it.  but:\n\nBut that needs to be done with the blessing of her actual parents.  Honestly, your whole attitude here shows you have an attitude towards her:\n\n> I'm hoping it will teach her some gratitude for what I do for her, every week", "ESH, you're being a little harsh but I feel like her parents baby her too much. At this age she should start learning how to take care of stuff.", "She shouldn't have to pay for it with her money . The rest is normal chores that most kids have to do. I wouldn't call this a punishment, it's basic skills. \nNTA if you don't have her pay.", "ESH, her parents are dropping the ball on addressing this, because it's such a weird behavior it doesn't make sense that neither of her parents are questioning this, and also not expecting her to find a way to deal with it. \n\n\"I'm hoping it will teach her some gratitude for what I do for her, every week\"  is what tells me that you're being an asshole. You aren't acting as a parent, you're acting as an adult who is bitter having to deal with a child who isn't yours and wants to punish her for being around when you don't want her. But guess what, you married someone with a kid, if you actually don't want to be a stepparent and deal with having a kid around, and your partner isn't stepping up, that's not the kid's fault.

She needs to learn.", "YTA her parents disagree rightfully because she's 9! While I understand being a little frustrated you seem to be incredibly punative about a pretty normal childhood issue.\n\nJust take the clothes out and don't wash them. Otherwise you are entirely too worried about punishment when this is just one of the expected parts of parenting. And forcing her to pay is out of bounds.", "YTA. You shouldn't be punishing someone else's child. Do only your own laundry if you can't stand to rewash clothes, for which I don't blame you.", "Just put the clothes she hadn\u2019t worn yet back in drawers / closets. Why wash them? How dirty does a 9 year old girl get?  \n\nI am sure she has a tough time since her bio parents couldn\u2019t make it work.", "YTA if you make her pay for it. She\u2019s 9. Kids respond better to offering help when they\u2019re overwhelmed and putting a bunch of clothes back can seem like a big job. I think getting her to help with the laundry is good so she realizes what effort is required, but more from a learning approach and less from a punishment approach. If you feel like you need to punish her (as a step parent) you\u2019re just going to make her resent you. Her parents should dole out punishments, you should help her learn about chores and the effort required to upkeep a home.", "Literally every kid does this, I have 3 that do this. If you cat handle being a step party dont be one. Don't act like she's a monster though.", "YTA the \u2018punishment\u2019 is way to severe for a 9 year old behaving developmentally appropriately. You new to work with your daughter.

After two days they aren't even broken in yet!", "NTA. I see nothing wrong here except the paying for the laundry. Does she get an allowance? How is she paying for the laundry? I feel like 9 is a bit young to be paying for things. I think the punishment is perfect besides that. It relates to the offense. You want her to stop throwing clean clothes in the laundry so you are punishing her by showing her how much extra work she is causing for you. I encourage you to make this a regular thing. Make it a teaching experience not a punishment. Teaching your children to do chores young makes a more responsible adult what they are older. She needs to understand how to do laundry at some point. Best to learn when your there to help her than when she moves out.", "Exactly!", "Yes!! It\u2019s kind of sad your partner hasn\u2019t supported you in this\u2026 she\u2019s obviously getting the habit or just overall irresponsibility from somewhere\u2026", "My sons did their own laundry from the time they were 7 and 8.  I agree, NTA.  IF T", "Seriously, it sounds like the core issue here is that this person rather than fighting with their partner about being uninvolved is choosing to punish the child.

It teaches actions have consequences.", "INFO: what have her parents done to address this behavior?", "Idk the own money part, but that was the average age of my two boys when I made them start doing their own laundry for the exact same reason. \n\nShe\u2019ll live. \n\nNTA.", "NTA", "NTA, and this is a perfect, well thought out, NON-cruel punishment that to me seems like an excellent parenting decision!", "The punishment fits the crime. She is old enough that having her deal with the laundry this time will teach her not to throw her clean clothes in the hamper to avoid putting them away. She now knows she will be forced to deal with her own laundry when she gives you additional work to avoid her job of putting her clothes away. \n\nDoing this makes way more parenting sense than yelling, ignoring it, or grounding her.

Got it in one.", "You take care of yours honey and don't worry about what I do.", "At the same time - she is 9. I don\u2019t even know if I could properly fold clothes at 9, let alone keep track of how many times to wear clothes, which clothes are worn \"twice\" etc. Especially if she has two households and isn't being held to the same standards at the other house. \n\nWhy don\u2019t you try getting a 2nd hamper that's specifically for \"clean\" clothes, and if she tries something on or only wears the jeans once, she can just throw it in the *second* hamper, and then you have her fold everything up at the end of the day? You're NTA, but I think holding a 9 year old to the same laundry-standards as yourself is a little harsh. Coming from an adult woman who really struggled with keeping things tidy as a child.", "u/Tardegrades is NTA\n\nActions have consequences.\n\nI went with mother to laundrymat when I was that age(no babysitter around)--so I goofed off more than I washed clothes, but I knew how to do it.  \n\nMaybe she'll learn, but not if the parents don't support you.  However, if they continue to not back you,  You need to have your husband do the laundry.  Then HE can deal with it.\n\nAnd please no excuses from him about being too busy, or this is the \"chore\" you agreed to do.

I think you need to try to figure out what is going on with the 9 year old first. \n\nLike maybe she had too many clothes out/available at once? \n\nIs there a system you, the parent and the 9 year old can come up with to pre-select clothes for the week and put them in a special shelf or daily Tupperware boxes or something so that she's not having to go through the clothes?\n\nCan you konmari the clothes together and try to sort them out more appropriately?\n\nAre the drawers or shelves she has available overly full or too difficult to use?\n\nHave you asked her what is making it difficult to manage her clothing?\n\nIt seems like some collaborative parenting and problem solving is needed here to come up with a solution.", "NTA.
