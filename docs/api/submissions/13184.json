I reiterated these things in a text and said please call me if they say anything else needs done other than x, y, and z so I can make the decision myself. They said okay.\n\nA little while after the appointment they tell me what the bill was, and what all the vet did. The bill is almost double what I had been quoted over the phone and there were several tests and a shot given that I did not ask for or agree to.\n\nSO says they misunderstood my text about not allowing extra work without checking with me, and says my text message did not mention the specific testing I was okay with, so they agreed to all the extra testing and the extra shot that came with testing.

Now, if SO had tried to reach OP to ask what was ok and OP couldn't be reached, that's a different story.", "NTA. I had my sister take my cat to the vet for her vaccinations because I could not get off work at the time. Peak season for my work, basically no one gets time off.

I always call and ask before I approve any testing and only authorize cheaper things myself. It is not that hard.", "NTA, I don't get what the SO is thinking, but it might be about control. But clearly they can't be trusted with anything involving money so it's not looking great future-wise. I'd expect them to pay back every extra cent.", "Oh people calling this person out, NOPE, Vets have become voracious with expensive testing and other money makers.  I have noticed this especially with the corporate owned ones.  \n\nYou can't let them take advantage of you, and its tough. \n\nBut, I would recommend a new vet, good luck with that one, and going to appointment too.

I have been in this position before, it sucks.  You trusted him to do what's right for the pet and your car. When it's someone elses money, its a bottomless pit. When it comes to your car he should have told you what else you needed done so you could have taken it in at a later time to finish it up.   \n\nIf it's truly a miscommunication problem that should end right there.  If it happens again he disregards your wishes. Tell him next time if there is any additional cost he will have to pay for it, I'm sure that will stop it.  I understand you have to work  but if you dont trust him to take care of what he thinks you need, you will have to the time off and do it yourself. There was no malicious intent here unless you truely believe he was disrgarding your financial situation (as he says he misread the text) only you know if he is an excuse maker, if he takes responsibility for his wrong doings or blames other people. \n\nYou are not the asshole for not wanting to pay the extras, chalk it up as a learning lesson he sounds like had your best interest at heart as you trusted him to be. See if he is willing to pay for the extras himself, you might get lucky. \n\nPeople who provide service always want more then what you go in for.  It's safest to take on this reponsibility yourself if you don't trust someone else to fill in the extras you may very well need.  What if your pet did need that test, if you had to take it back you would have to pay yet another office visit.  You were not there to hear what the vet said so he really may have thought you needed it. \n\nAssholes come with malicious intent, or disregarding your reality and wishes.  Only you know him to know which one it was.  You had no malicious intent by sending him in.  So this situation just sucks.", "NTA. My wife had to taker our dogter to the vet a few weeks ago. Unbeknownst to her, her phone was acting up and she couldn\u2019t receive phone calls (drop off/ pick her up later).

So bugger off with your insults.", "So veterinarians should work for free?", "Second opinions are always important and no vet should have a problem with that - incidentally, no DOCTOR should have a problem with that for expensive procedures. Speaking as the daughter of a surgeon and someone who has had many furbabies and vet visits.  But I do think for the most part, vets are honestly trying their best. You don't tend to become a vet unless you love animals and then you constantly deal with people who either rabidly love their animals and see them as family members and you have to tell them their loved one cat be saved... or you have to deal with people who want to put down a dog or cat for a minor inconvenience. It doesn't seem to be a very easy job at all. Are some vets in it for the money? Yes, everyone field has people who don't actually have any empathy and only want the money. But I think for the most parts, vets are trying to work within what is available to them and the costs that they're required to charge by various people over them or as you said, corporate. \n\nAlso, another real difficulty with animals is that...let's face it, tests costs A LOT for humans too, but we can clarify exactly what we feel is wrong and refuse tests we consider off the mark. But how do we determine that for a pet? We might have NOTICED some aspects are off, but that can sometimes have the root in something totally unexpected and it's not like the pet can tell us. So the tests need to be done and they need to be a wide range. And look, I just had the honor of paying 1000 in vet bills only to find out that my cat has a rare as hell cancer that every study has failed to even find out it responds to any sort of treatment, so the surgery we had done isn't even LIKELY to help him, because we thought it'd just be a normal skin cancer and we'd find out afterwards if it had been all safely removed... but that's not the results the vet got back. It's not his fault and he hated giving us the results because there's nothing we can do except wait and see and if my cat starts demonstrating being sick, then it may be a sign that it's moved inwards and...even then, it can't be stopped, we can only make his life comfortable at that point. Tests suck. Ironically, our vet said he wished he could have just... not told us the results because there is nothing to do. He's not going \"Let's do radiation\" or \"Let's try this medicine\" or even \"Let's run more tests\", though he gave us the option to being referred to the giant vet school an hour away that has a huge oncology department....but that's up to us and he warned us it'd be far more expensive there and that all the studies indicated they wouldn't be able to do anything either.

Would\u2019ve sold cars or something if thats the kind of job i wanted. But no, actually care about animals instead and trying to get them healthy. And people wonder why the mental health of the profession is absolute rubbish.", "Thank you for what you do!\n\nI love my vet. She's the sweetest woman ever and it's a father/daughter veterinary practice. We literally just had a conversation last week about rates of veterinarian suicide. I mean, how many other jobs do you go to work every day, deal with sickness and death, and STILL get accused of robbing people? Not many people would put themselves through that if they didn't actually care about animals.", "Obviously cannot speak for all vets but since patients cannot speak for themselves, tests are a way to figure out what is going on. If you feel salesy, go to another vet. But if they don\u2019t offer the textbook standard of tests for the presenting symptoms, often owners go make board complaints or threaten their licenses. They are obligated to offer their recommendations as the medical professional in the situation, but the owner makes the decision. That is the key difference between human and animal healthcare. They\u2019re not being salesy, they\u2019re doing their goddamn job.", "Not that deep,  dude", "Definitely depends. Had our doctor go on vacation while waiting for test results and another vet at the practice gave us half the results that came in and persuaded me to spend over a hundred more dollars on a test that completely got disregarded because the other results provided the answer we needed. He was after money. Our doctor never would have done us like that. He actually is constantly trying to save us money. We have never complained about money, so breathe of fresh air for him to offer money saving tips with their medicine and whatnot. Just need to find one that cares about the animals and is a genuine and trustworthy person.", "This... All of this.\n\nVets do not get enough respect. On their best days, they're dealing with cranky patients and some even worse owners, and on their worst days it's death. Rates of veterinary suicide are on par with pediatric oncology. \n\nAnd vet medicine is NOT cheap, like you said, but if you love them, you do it. My cat had FIV last summer and by the time it was over, I'd spent a couple of thousand trying to treat him. You do what you can.", "Louder for the people in the back! \ud83d\udc4f", "Rising malpractice insurance? Are you just spitting out random things backpedaling now? There has been no change in that cost for years, not to mention it's not a direct malpractice insurance like people think of for human healthcare.", "Yeah the veterinarian you are seeing has no say in the price points and offers investigations because patients cannot speak for themselves. A lot of vets are not happy with the corporatization of the industry but have too much educational debt to own their own clinic and run it how they would prefer. \n\nThere are low cost options that are run by charities but since medical equipment, expertise, consumables, etc cost money those places will not operate under \u201ctextbook standard\u201d care but do the absolute best that they can nonetheless.", "human healthcare is also very expensive. i guess doctors should also work for free.\n\n/s", "Uh, no. \"Don't make big financial and health decisions for my pet\" is pretty clear cut and common sense. Don't use that \"new place\" excuse. SO is an adult.", "Nah, I think it's good to confront and examine potential internal biases we have.  It doesn't have to be deep, but it shouldn't be ignored.", "There is a possibility this person's significant other was only acting in the best interest of the pet. If OP had concerns about their pet vomiting, being lethargic, not eating, etc, that would warrant additional diagnostics/ treatments alongside the hands-on examination. Situations like this happen frequently in vetmed.", "You don't have to join in, but you also don't have to put someone down for their relationship with their pet.  When you have to make hard decisions for them, constantly care for them, go in to debt trying to give them the best life possible, and hold them while they pass away, then how can you say they are not like a child?\n\nEdit: grammar", "Bad analogy...children are covered under insurance. Pets are not...unless you have gotten pet insurance before hand. And the vet is more expensive than the doctors!", "I mean, it's not even necessarily a bias. We all tend to automatically gender things, and then correct if we were wrong. It's not even about bias, it's about when I read this story in my head, this is how I perceived it.", "To be honest, even with older pets, it is a call whether to do or not. Most surgery is needed so often choice is do or PTS. We have an older lad who had dental and lump removal last week. He's not bouncing back that well but sore teeth were making his life harder. Vet did check heart etc before hand.", "I don't work anywhere near veterinary medicine, but I could definitely diagnose a ruptured anal gland.", "But the vet tech at a minimum should relay the info they get from the owner to the vet. And how is it relevant, you never explained why the cats issue would be relevant, after OP has already said that the extra tests and shots were for a general annual check up and not relating to the actual issue.", "I mean it says in the post the decision was made without calling OP.", "THANK YOU.\n\nI'm 42 years old, never married and likely never will be. I've lost both of my animals in the past 6 months, but they were the closest to children I'll ever have.", "Not everybody has insurance. And the vet is not always more expensive than human doctors, that's just silly, what the fuck? And a pet is not quite on the level of necessity to survival that taking care of your own child is. I would pay some money that would inconvenience me for a pet's survival. I'd go to a hell of a lot more extremes for my child.", "The automatic gendering one way or the other is a bias, but bias isn't inherently bad.  That's why it is good to examine whatever bias you have, so you can ensure it doesn't come from a bad place, or make changes if it turns out it does.\n\nYou have examined the bias and found it to not come from a place of hate, or repression, or malice or whatever . . . so you've done what I am saying you should do.", "General anesthesia for my human child costed 750$ with zero insurance accepted as it was done at the dental office and not in a hospital. So guess it all depends on location.", "NTA - Your SO doesn't have a backbone when it comes to saying no to extra stuff. I would suggest making the rule for SO to call/text before paying for anything and getting services done. Clearly, even if you are specific, in the moment, perhaps SO is being talked into extra charges and cannot say no. At least with a call/text, SO will be able to convey what you are willing to pay for in the moment.", "If your regular vet can\u2019t get see your pet in a timely manner when you feel something is off with your pet, you need a new vet. The fact that you felt the need to make an appointment with an entirely different vet practice (not even one of your usual vet\u2019s colleagues could see you?) to have your pet seen is absolutely bonkers to me\u2014not your behavior, of course, I mean the vet not working you in some way, in a decent time frame , is bonkers.\n\nthat said, you are NTA. Your SO isn\u2019t being attentive to your needs/wants, and it seems from your post that its becoming a pattern. My suggestion would be to address that most importantly, and ensure that SO understands where they went wrong (perhaps they don\u2019t see the difference between a pet and a car, but a pet is not a car. Extra, unnecessary testing and/or treatment could be stressful, it\u2019s unfair for the pet to endure that. And it\u2019s unfair to cause you potential monetary strain)", "NTA\nYour SO should be paying for any extra things they agreed to have done.", "I'm going YTA for leaving out any useful information. You've not even said how much money we're talking about, and for what.", "NTA, and *THEY* should be paying the difference. Their decision, their cost. In the future, I would advise communicating directly with the vet. Tell them what your pet is being brought in for, what things you are expecting to have done (if you have some idea), and that *absolutely, positively nothing else is to be done without YOUR authorization*. And set a maximum amount they are not to go over without authorization as well. My vet has the ability to accept texts, as well as emails, so such correspondence is in writing. That will protect you as well.", "ESH.  You should tell the vet that they need to call you to approve anything done, same with the shop, that SO can\u2019t approve what needs to be done because you are paying.  You are because that is common practice and you had a past issue.  You also because it sounds like you weren\u2019t clear in your message.  SO is because either they don\u2019t pay attention or it\u2019s just too much for them to understand and remember, but they should just tell the place to contact you.", "Absolutely, positively YTA.\n\nAs a fellow pet owner myself with regular vet visits, it can be very hard to diagnose some issues, and even harder to predict the bill I'll be coming out with. If my pet had a serious issue, there is absolutely no way in hell I would trust someone else to handle him. What the heck is wrong with you?\n\nIf you already knew exactly what your pet had, what kind of test you wanted done, why do you even need a vet?\n\nIf your budget can't handle fluctuations from unexpected issues with your pet, handle your pet yourself or get a pet insurance instead of trying to get others to do the work for you and being upset when they don't do exactly how you wanted it.", "NTA. The fact that you clearly communicated and set boundaries and they stomped all over them? Hell, I would ask for them to pay the difference since you did not agree to those tests or the shot.", "I dont think its bonkers if they couldn't get her in. If there's only 1 vet, it's stressful enough to see so many clients. I work at a clinic and it's hard trying to see everyone that calls in, when we set normal appointments they can last over an hour because some decisions take time to decide which run into other appointments pushing everything later. We get so many complaints about wait times when its not in our hands then we get yelled out for not squeezing someone in for an \"emergency \" that has been going on for some time, yet we have to rush them in? She shouldn't made time to go in herself. I find it hard to believe she has absolutely no time off", "This is a bit more nuanced than most people here are admitting IMO. I think bf is an AH because he should have called you but depending on his reasoning I can see his side a bit. It can be tricky understanding what the proper thing to do is when you are acting for someone else. \n\nA simpler example: going grocery shopping. You were sent to buy cupcakes for your SO. The store is sold out of cupcakes. Do you go to a different store? Do you get muffins instead? Do you call them and ask (or is it too trivial)? There are always going to be deviations from the plan and it\u2019s hard to handle them appropriately. \n\nThis time should bf have called you? Absolutely. Was he in a difficult situation? Also yes. \n\nUltimately y\u2019all are just gonna have to figure out a better way to communicate when it comes to stuff like this because somewhere between you knowing what you wanted in your head and your bf knowing what you wanted, there was a disconnect. \n\nOr your bf just willingly did the wrong thing. Then he\u2019s just an asshole.", "While I agree it\u2019s probably a minority, it\u2019s not an insult. The reality is that it\u2019s a for-profit business. \n\nIt\u2019s not a knock on vets, it\u2019s a consequence of capitalism. It is, quite literally, unavoidable, as that is the expected outcome. \n\nThat\u2019s also why we have big issues with predatory dentistry. So so many people have lost their teeth because of it. \n\nIf the goal of any business is to make the most money, and pushing treatments gets more money\u2026 then naturally that\u2019s what\u2019s gonna happen. \n\nEthics matter too, but you could even make the argument that ethics only matter because money (think publicity and fines).", "As a tech, I also get really tired of feeling like a sales person just to get people to do basic care for their pets.", "So, you said your cat had been vomiting but wasn\u2019t currently, and the vet gave an anti-nausea medication, but your complaint was as if he gave it for vomiting\u2026how do you know the cat wasn\u2019t nauseous? You can feel nauseous and not vomit. That medication also provides some pain relief if his stomach is painful as well as providing some help as an anti inflammatory (in case his intestines are inflamed due to IBD). What other \u201ccrazy tests\u201d did he do, and which diet? It wasn\u2019t \u201cmuch\u201d different than what you had him on? Depending on what condition you might be treating that difference could save his life.", "Yikes, referencing Chewy treats as a form of long term dental care and that adding blood work is a form of just making money speaks volumes about your knowledge and opinions. I feel sorry for any vet that has to deal with you as a client.", "Vs an anal fissure vs an anal gland mass that\u2019s ulcerated?", "YTA\n\nI was at so many vet visits with so many pets and especially if it comes to diagnosis its often a \"ok, lets check this\", then they come back and tell \"the results could mean x or z, to confirm which one we need to additionaly do another test, ultrasound, whatever. Just processing all of it is already a lot, if i would have to check every time with someone on the phone would slow down the process and is exhausting and they don't have all the information you got from the vet. Sometimes the way your vet looks at you or your pet can make you spontanously agree to a test you wouldn't agree to if you only have the blank data. \n\nLook, for car repair, i understand, but at the vet you have a living creatures with you and if its not your own pet oc you want to make sure the vet doesn't miss something and in the end the other person blames you if the diagnosis was wrong or something. A car is not the same. If you want to do the decisions at the vet, i'm sorry, you need to take the day off.", "NTA. Sounds like the person is a bit spineless and can\u2019t say no to upselling.", "NTA - but tbh I would not see ever joining finances or a living with your partner longterm.

Cat is still young, and I get her nails trimmed monthly and that's almost 20.", "NTA, I do think you were clear enough with \u201cany testing\u201d.\nBut from now on I would never let your partner bring anything to the vet or garage  or store for you. If it goes wrong again Y-W-T-A to yourself.", "Or they're a push over. If the vet says 'hmm I'd get this shot just to be sure, it's always worth having in the best interest of the animal' OP's bf might just be like 'mmm yeah if you say so' and not be confident enough to say 'actually not today, thanks'", "Is it? If I'm in charge of someone else's finances I'm always hyper stingy and careful. I had to buy oil for my boss once and spent a good fifteen minutes debating price, quality and quantity before deciding. I think it's super hard spending money that's not mine.
