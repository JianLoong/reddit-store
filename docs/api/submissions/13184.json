I know it comes from a good place, but I don\u2019t appreciate decisions being made for me, especially when I am the one financially responsible for them.\n\nLeading to the vet visit we talked about what I was concerned about, what was being done, what I had arranged the appointment for. I reiterated these things in a text and said please call me if they say anything else needs done other than x, y, and z so I can make the decision myself. They said okay.\n\nA little while after the appointment they tell me what the bill was, and what all the vet did. The bill is almost double what I had been quoted over the phone and there were several tests and a shot given that I did not ask for or agree to.\n\nSO says they misunderstood my text about not allowing extra work without checking with me, and says my text message did not mention the specific testing I was okay with, so they agreed to all the extra testing and the extra shot that came with testing.

Now, if SO had tried to reach OP to ask what was ok and OP couldn't be reached, that's a different story.", "NTA. I had my sister take my cat to the vet for her vaccinations because I could not get off work at the time. Peak season for my work, basically no one gets time off.

I always call and ask before I approve any testing and only authorize cheaper things myself. It is not that hard.", "NTA, I don't get what the SO is thinking, but it might be about control. But clearly they can't be trusted with anything involving money so it's not looking great future-wise. I'd expect them to pay back every extra cent.", "Oh people calling this person out, NOPE, Vets have become voracious with expensive testing and other money makers.  I have noticed this especially with the corporate owned ones.  \n\nYou can't let them take advantage of you, and its tough. \n\nBut, I would recommend a new vet, good luck with that one, and going to appointment too.

I have been in this position before, it sucks.  You trusted him to do what's right for the pet and your car. When it's someone elses money, its a bottomless pit. When it comes to your car he should have told you what else you needed done so you could have taken it in at a later time to finish it up.   \n\nIf it's truly a miscommunication problem that should end right there.  If it happens again he disregards your wishes. Tell him next time if there is any additional cost he will have to pay for it, I'm sure that will stop it.  I understand you have to work  but if you dont trust him to take care of what he thinks you need, you will have to the time off and do it yourself. There was no malicious intent here unless you truely believe he was disrgarding your financial situation (as he says he misread the text) only you know if he is an excuse maker, if he takes responsibility for his wrong doings or blames other people. \n\nYou are not the asshole for not wanting to pay the extras, chalk it up as a learning lesson he sounds like had your best interest at heart as you trusted him to be. See if he is willing to pay for the extras himself, you might get lucky. \n\nPeople who provide service always want more then what you go in for.  It's safest to take on this reponsibility yourself if you don't trust someone else to fill in the extras you may very well need.  What if your pet did need that test, if you had to take it back you would have to pay yet another office visit.  You were not there to hear what the vet said so he really may have thought you needed it. \n\nAssholes come with malicious intent, or disregarding your reality and wishes.  Only you know him to know which one it was.  You had no malicious intent by sending him in.  So this situation just sucks.", "NTA. My wife had to taker our dogter to the vet a few weeks ago. Unbeknownst to her, her phone was acting up and she couldn\u2019t receive phone calls (drop off/ pick her up later).

So bugger off with your insults.", "So veterinarians should work for free?", "Second opinions are always important and no vet should have a problem with that - incidentally, no DOCTOR should have a problem with that for expensive procedures. Speaking as the daughter of a surgeon and someone who has had many furbabies and vet visits.  But I do think for the most part, vets are honestly trying their best. You don't tend to become a vet unless you love animals and then you constantly deal with people who either rabidly love their animals and see them as family members and you have to tell them their loved one cat be saved... or you have to deal with people who want to put down a dog or cat for a minor inconvenience. It doesn't seem to be a very easy job at all. Are some vets in it for the money? Yes, everyone field has people who don't actually have any empathy and only want the money. But I think for the most parts, vets are trying to work within what is available to them and the costs that they're required to charge by various people over them or as you said, corporate. \n\nAlso, another real difficulty with animals is that...let's face it, tests costs A LOT for humans too, but we can clarify exactly what we feel is wrong and refuse tests we consider off the mark. But how do we determine that for a pet? We might have NOTICED some aspects are off, but that can sometimes have the root in something totally unexpected and it's not like the pet can tell us. So the tests need to be done and they need to be a wide range. And look, I just had the honor of paying 1000 in vet bills only to find out that my cat has a rare as hell cancer that every study has failed to even find out it responds to any sort of treatment, so the surgery we had done isn't even LIKELY to help him, because we thought it'd just be a normal skin cancer and we'd find out afterwards if it had been all safely removed... but that's not the results the vet got back. It's not his fault and he hated giving us the results because there's nothing we can do except wait and see and if my cat starts demonstrating being sick, then it may be a sign that it's moved inwards and...even then, it can't be stopped, we can only make his life comfortable at that point. Tests suck. Ironically, our vet said he wished he could have just... not told us the results because there is nothing to do. He's not going \"Let's do radiation\" or \"Let's try this medicine\" or even \"Let's run more tests\", though he gave us the option to being referred to the giant vet school an hour away that has a huge oncology department....but that's up to us and he warned us it'd be far more expensive there and that all the studies indicated they wouldn't be able to do anything either.  He could have sold us some snail oil and we'd have probably TRIED it, but he didn't. So not all vets are out to just take money from vulnerable pet lovers. It's important to remember most of them love animals and are just in the bad situation of, for some reason, not having a psychic connection with animals and being able to tell EXACTLY what tests are needed so they can keep costs down.", "I just ate the cost because at the end of the day it is my pet and I\u2019m just thankful she was able to be seen. I wouldn\u2019t have even cared about the price had I been given the chance to think it over and make the decision myself.\n\nBut the extra testing and shots were something I had planned to handle with her primary vet as this was a last minute vet to get her seen, and had nothing to do with what she was being seen for, so given the chance I would have said no to them.\n\nI\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s about control, it feels more like wanting to be helpful or just going with whatever the person at the vet told them because they don\u2019t like to push back.", "This is only the second time something like this has happened. First time I didn\u2019t set any ground rules or expectations, which is on me. This time I did and felt like I was very clear in them, but they were still gone around. I acknowledge I could have been even clearer about my expectations, but I truly felt like I was clear enough. I don\u2019t feel like twice is enough to establish a pattern to avoid. I probably won\u2019t be asking for help again though, even though I appreciated the help in general.", "We don't have time for that in a ten or fifteen minute appointment as half the time, the owner doesn't answer. Stop sending pets to the vet without clear written instructions or someone who doesn't have the authority over their care.", "The issue pet went to the vet for has a visual symptom which is an almost dead give away for what it was. I spoke to the vet tech when making the appointment and based on the info I gave them, they confirmed it sounded like what I was thinking. And it was. The extra tests and shot were part of a general annual exam that I had planned to take care of at my pets primary vet when I was able to schedule time off, this was something I wanted addressed sooner than I was able to get off which is why she went to a vet she doesn\u2019t normally go to.", "It's not a fucking CHILD. Jesus. I love my frigging cat, but she's not equal to my son. Just stop with pretending pets are children and trying to make other people think of them as children.", "I wonder why you have decided the OP is female and the SO is male, given genders are not once mentioned in the post.", ">My mom was willing to pay, but even I called her to make sure she\u2019d be ok with the amount bc I\u2019m not the one paying.\n\nThis is a very different situation. And I think OP's SO genuinely thought they had agreed to testing that OP wanted. Vets are confusing and it's hard to make these kinds of decisions even when it's your own pet. If OP cared this much, OP should have taken their own pet to the vet. It's hard  to ask for a favor and then say \"you did this wrong\". If you want something done only one exact way, do it yourself.", "[deleted]", "I never feel taken advantage of by my vet. He\u2019s very good about not recommending expensive things unless they\u2019re truly necessary. I\u2019m sure there\u2019s some bad vets out there, but I agree that most are good and want what\u2019s best for the pets they\u2019re treating.", "Amazing. No-one said that.", "This is just an area that you can't trust your SO. If there are no other big issues, of them spending your money without checking, of course.  \n\nI know that if I ask my husband to run the dishwasher or a load of laundry, while I'm out, there's a 50-50 chance he will utterly forget. I get home, ask if he got it done and he'll rush off to do it.  \n\nSo, just know in this sort of situation, he will take care of it and then some!", "But you also sent them to a different vet the 2nd time. So, you may have been somewhat clearer in your expectations, but they were in a whole new place figuring things out FOR YOU again. You got to give people some leeway when they're doing you a favor.", "I\u2019m a mom of 3 and I stand by what I said. We don\u2019t get to dictate how someone else regards their pets. And my analogy suited the situation in question.", "I don\u2019t know. I wasn\u2019t honestly paying attention. I was just trying to get my thoughts out.", "Because sexism is a two way street, but we only look one way.", ">Leading up to the vet vist we talked about what I was concerned about, what was being done, what I had arranged the appointment for. *I reiterated these in a text* and *said please call me if they say anything else needs to be done other than x, y, and z so I can make the decision myself.*\n\nThey had a conversation **and** OP also put it in writing via text. OP says in a text to contact if anything else needs to be done.\n\nEither SO folds under pressure and thus cannot be counted on to take care of a vet visit, a car repair issue, etc., or SO just doesn\u2019t care bc it\u2019s not their money.", "In my edit I am referring to my cat as she.", "I wrote this before OP edited.", "Mine will advise against tests if feels not in best interests of pet or if it will not affect treatment. It is always the key question to remember if paying for medical treatment - will this affect the treatment plan? If not, the added knowledge is a nice to have.\n\nBut the added information can be absolutely necessary. People are saying she should have been phoned or made another appointment. Was she available to be phoned? Was she happy to wait until another appointment - if so, why not in first place? If you authorise someone to take your pet to vet, you are putting them in a difficult position if you want them to refuse treatment when animal is in distress. Can argue same with car if needed like brakes but postponing. Though solution would be to ask him to pay difference but then don't expect favours later.", "Sure. Just, if you regard your pet as equal to a child, that's on you. Don't expect everyone else to join you in that. \n\nThat being said, wouldn't you get the extras the Dr was recommending if it literally was your child? Or you thought your partner regarded the pet as a child? Right. So the partner's heart was probably in the right place, even if they're such an awful person for not following OP's instructions to the T when going to a new vet.", "Just seems a little suspect to me that you apparently default to one gender being right and one gender being wrong.", "Full mouth extraction generally run far higher than $1000 but that will vary by median income and location for a given clinic. When there is huge discrepancy in pricing between vets in a similar area, I would bet there is a true difference in the service being offered: pre-anesthetic bloodwork, anesthetic monitoring, dental radiography, etc. You have to decide if that is important to you for your own pet. \nAnesthesia for humans may seem cheap to you, but that\u2019s because the bill is picked up by insurance. Without insurance, general anesthesia is thousands of dollars.", "Of course I would get the extras. However, I would never get the extras on someone else\u2019s pet without asking the actual owner. It wasn\u2019t the partner\u2019s place to make those decisions. It was their place to call OP and ask if she wanted the extras done, especially since she was the one footing the bill.", "Geezum crow - stop over analyzing everything. It\u2019s not that big of a deal. Let it go and, I don\u2019t know, maybe respond to the original poster.", "You dint mention VCA at all. You literally just said VETS. As in all of us.", "You seem to be the one getting bent out of shape, I merely pointed out your apparent internal bias."]}
