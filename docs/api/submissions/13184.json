To everyone saying that OP is the AH, it's pretty common sense that unless it's an emergency you don't make major decisions on behalf of someone else's loved ones or finances. And OP should have a partner that does understands that. It's not that hard to understand. Now, if SO had tried to reach OP to ask what was ok and OP couldn't be reached, that's a different story.", "NTA. I had my sister take my cat to the vet for her vaccinations because I could not get off work at the time. Peak season for my work, basically no one gets time off. She called me and asked about anything extra, so I could approve it. I also bring my brother's cat to the vet because of his work. I always call and ask before I approve any testing and only authorize cheaper things myself. It is not that hard.", "NTA, I don't get what the SO is thinking, but it might be about control. But clearly they can't be trusted with anything involving money so it's not looking great future-wise. I'd expect them to pay back every extra cent.", "Oh people calling this person out, NOPE, Vets have become voracious with expensive testing and other money makers.  I have noticed this especially with the corporate owned ones.  \n\nYou can't let them take advantage of you, and its tough. \n\nBut, I would recommend a new vet, good luck with that one, and going to appointment too.  SO should have asked how much.", "NTA. SO had no right to agree to all of the extra tests, etc at OP's expense, especially since it was made clear to them that OP would make that decision after being informed.  \n\n\nOP I would ask SO to pay the additional expenses. I would also put a note on your file with the vet that no one but you is authorized to approve charges.", "NTA. You gave an adult specific verbal AND written instructions (that they could refer back to) with possibly the option of calling you. They had every tool any competent and thoughtful person would need to complete the task. I would be concerned about trusting them with future tasks that could someday be even more important or recurring.", "So your aware your SO  does this. Has a history of doing it YET you keep allowing giving them tasks and expecting the result to change. Then when it doesn't, you get the bill, get upset and do it all over again. YTA for not learning the 1st,2nd or 3rd time", "NTA, she can pay for it.", "NTA. No one wants to pay double what they were expecting for something they didn\u2019t ask for, more than likely even completely unnecessary", "This is **your** pet. YOU are the only one responsible for your pet's treatment. YOU are the one who should have taken your pet to the vet. Stop relying on someone else to pick up your slack. For that, I'd say YTA.\n\nOn the other hand, SO had no right to agree to extra charges without contacting you first. So NTA for that.", "It\u2019s giving me willful ignorance and weaponized incompetence. I would say NTA and then tell SO why I won\u2019t be able to trust them with certain things moving forward and the ways in which they can earn back that trust.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMake a new rule: When they spend more money on your behalf without asking, you will not reimbourse them.", "NTA\n\nIf it's a \"simple misunderstanding\" like he says, then he should be willing to pay for the tests and shot that you didn't okay. In the future, I would have the vet's office note in the file that no procedures are to be performed without authorization from the person with financial responsibility.", "NTA I often take my moms pets to the vet for her because my schedule is more flexible. If the vet ever says something needs to be done, I always tell the vet I need to take a second to call my mom since she is paying for the visit. Its slightly awkward, but it's not my money to spend.", "I'd be annoyed too but YTA even so. If you want it done the way you want it, don't send your partner to do it. They can't read your mind.", "YTA\n\nHe did you a favor and yes, he misunderstood some of the instructions but none of it was malicious. And frankly, misunderstandings are not uncommon when people send their SO or child to the vet with the pet. \n\nAlso... were you even reachable to ask about additional testing? And if so, then why didn't you just make time to \"attend\" the visit by phone so you could speak with the vet directly?", "Soft YTA- it probably was just a misunderstanding. You sent somebody to the vet in your place, to a certain extent they are going to be put on the spot and be asked to make decisions. You shouldn\u2019t send somebody to represent yourself in such an important situation if you aren\u2019t willing to let them make decisions in the moment. If you cared that much, you should have just taken a day off work to take your pet to the vet like most people do. \n\nEdit to add: Your pet probably needed the shots if the vet gave them, it sounds like what needed to be done", "YTA\n\nIf you want to be in control you need to do your own chores.  End of story.", "YTA. You ask someone to do favors for you and then routinely complain about how they do them. Figure out a way to do them yourself. It's a pattern, change it instead of berating her for doing it \"wrong\"", "Slight YTA.\n\nIf you wanted to make all the decisions, then you should have gone to the appointment.", "Sounds like a communication problem.  I have been in this position before, it sucks.  You trusted him to do what's right for the pet and your car. When it's someone elses money, its a bottomless pit. When it comes to your car he should have told you what else you needed done so you could have taken it in at a later time to finish it up.   \n\nIf it's truly a miscommunication problem that should end right there.  If it happens again he disregards your wishes. Tell him next time if there is any additional cost he will have to pay for it, I'm sure that will stop it.  I understand you have to work  but if you dont trust him to take care of what he thinks you need, you will have to the time off and do it yourself. There was no malicious intent here unless you truely believe he was disrgarding your financial situation (as he says he misread the text) only you know if he is an excuse maker, if he takes responsibility for his wrong doings or blames other people. \n\nYou are not the asshole for not wanting to pay the extras, chalk it up as a learning lesson he sounds like had your best interest at heart as you trusted him to be. See if he is willing to pay for the extras himself, you might get lucky. \n\nPeople who provide service always want more then what you go in for.  It's safest to take on this reponsibility yourself if you don't trust someone else to fill in the extras you may very well need.  What if your pet did need that test, if you had to take it back you would have to pay yet another office visit.  You were not there to hear what the vet said so he really may have thought you needed it. \n\nAssholes come with malicious intent, or disregarding your reality and wishes.  Only you know him to know which one it was.  You had no malicious intent by sending him in.  So this situation just sucks.", "NTA. My wife had to taker our dogter to the vet a few weeks ago. Unbeknownst to her, her phone was acting up and she couldn\u2019t receive phone calls (drop off/ pick her up later). So the vet reached out to me in regards to extra tests etc. Once it got to financial things I asked him if I could have her call him because that\u2019s her area, not mine. He had no problem with that and she greatly appreciated it", "NTA You gave clear instruction. Your partner could have contacted you if they were unsure. When i do something for my SO, i always get out my handy and tell the people what my partner wish for if i myself am unsure what this means since i have no idea of this stuff. \n\nIhave the feeling since your partner spends your money they have less problem to say \"yes\" to extra stuff because it doesn't hurt their finances. But what a shitty way of thinking...  It is so easy to spend the money of other people.", "NTA. Your SO knew what you wanted and didn\u2019t want. They simply disregarded what you said and is playing the innocent card now. Gaslighting you, specifically. You mention SO has done this more than once. Why are you still with SO? It\u2019s going to continue until you stop the relaxing SO. They obviously don\u2019t care about your wellbeing.", "nbta. y\u2019all just need to work on communication. to me it seems like you didn\u2019t explain what you wanted done in enough detail to someone who has a track record of need the specific details. just sit down and tell him exactly what you just posted", "YTA. SO did you a favor. You could've specified with the vet if there were specific things SO doesn't understand.\n\n If I was them I wouldn't be doing you anymore favors.", "YTA- do your own chores.", "YTA. Taking your pet to the vet or your car to the garage are pretty huge favors to ask.", "YTA. Don't ask your SO to do things for you. You've clearly been unhappy with this so many other times, so learn from your mistakes. It sounds like it would have cost less to take some time off work", "YTA. If you want to be totally in control at vet appointments, take time off work for them.
