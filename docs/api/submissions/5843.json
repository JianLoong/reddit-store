He can learn better ways to defend himself then retaliating that way though", "NTA - Seems like they think they are better than everyone because they \u201cdon\u2019t play idiot sports\u201d.

If anything in my eyes it just makes it worse as they will have experienced the misery they are subjecting him to.\n\nAnd even after all of that, if his answer to 'would you like to perform for us' is 'no', that should be respected.

Playing sports does not make you less intelligent or admirable. \n\nI would also like to say that while hockey moms are a little stuck up, it's because we have the right to be! Do you know how hard hockey is to play? It's very difficult! On top of the physical dexterity and physical courage it requires to hurl yourself at a fast pace across the ice, there are so many situations that require quick thinking, teamwork, and skill. \n\nI would venture to say that team sports are just as important to a child's development as a musical or language skill. The ability to win and lose as a team, not just an individual, to give of yourself for a larger purpose, and learn to work with multiple personalities in a stressful, fast paced environment is something they learn all the time. \n\nPerhaps your family needs to spend a little time indulging in interests that aren't based solely on their own achievements and learn about other people so they aren't as \"superior\" as they claim you are.", "> \u201csilly sport for brainless idiots over music which is so much more intelligent and admirable.\u201d\n\nTell your small minded family CERN has a powerlifting team.

Your son should not be subjected to that bullying and although he says he doesn't care, it does get in their heads at that age without them realizing it.
