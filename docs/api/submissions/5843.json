My husband agrees as well. \n\nOur other family members... they just can\u2019t understand why Liam would choose a \u201csilly sport for brainless idiots over music which is so much more intelligent and admirable.\u201d  \n\nLiam usually argues back, he\u2019ll usually say things like \u201cthat shit is for nerds\u201d or \u201conly losers are in the school\u2019s choir/band\u201d. While I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a particularly kind thing to say, I don\u2019t blame him for saying it after everyone bothers him about being in a hockey/baseball team and not joining band or choir. \n\nWe were at my SIL\u2019s Christmas party and a couple of the kids including my older two put on a performance. It was great. But after it ended, everyone immediately looked at Liam and kept telling him to do a solo. They all ignored his, mine and my husband\u2019s requests to leave him alone. \n\nI put Liam behind me so that everyone would stop pushing him and told them to cut it out.\n\nThey all laughed like it was funny and someone said that they just want him to do one song and that it won\u2019t hurt him. Someone else said \u201cyeah isn\u2019t he a hockey player, that\u2019s a lot worse than playing the guitar.\u201d Another one insulted his intelligence for absolutely no reason. \n\nI was a little... weirded out? Confused? I ended up saying \u201cy\u2019all are fucking weird.\u201d \n\nMy SIL and MIL immediately got up and said \u201cwhat the hell is your issue? just because your son plays hockey doesn\u2019t mean you get to act like *them.\u201d \n\n*context: there\u2019s a hockey mom community here and they act like they\u2019re better than everyone so not many people like them.*\n\nThey were upset and said no wonder Liam acts like that when his mom is just as bad. My husband told them to fuck off and we left. \n\nEveryone has been calling me to say that my son and I ruined Christmas with our superiority complex and entitlement? But I turned off my phone after I called my sister to vent and she told my parents what happened and they all joined in too.\n\nEVERYONE is calling us things and even one of my other kids said that Liam should\u2019ve just played the damn guitar.

At first I was annoyed that your son called band/chior people needs but it sounds like he is just defending himself. \nKeep supporting your son and have a good chat to your family about the bullying that are subjecting him to. If they don't get it I would have a chat to your son about how he's feeling.

It sounds like they haven\u2019t gotten over being bullied in high school over being band geeks, and now want to bully your son because he represents every jock who ever bullied them.

Your son doesn\u2019t deserve to be insulted and shamed at family gatherings where he\u2019s supposed to feel safe and supported.\n\n\nAlthough I do think you need to get your son to stop insulting music stuff too. I understand why he\u2019s doing it and agree he\u2019s being pushed into saying it, but it\u2019s going to be hurtful to the other kids in the family.

My son being 15 and outnumbered makes him an easy target. It\u2019s never ended this badly before though.\n\nAnd I suppose you have a point.
