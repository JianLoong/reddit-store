{"id": 26642, "submission_id": "16ft7pk", "title": "AITA? Grown daughter made her mess...", "selftext": "Ok, shortest version possible. We have a grown daughter(33) who has been nonstop drama since teenagehood. At 15, she found a \"gangster\" boy from Long Beach, here in small town, Ohio. She and hoodrat have 5 kids together and of course, he leaves. So now she has raised these kids alone (with our help), which I'm actually proud of her for. Fast forward a few years, next boyfriend is a guy she knew a long time ago, who is in prison (of course). This goes on for about 4 years now, and he's due to get out. Well, surprise, surprise, he's picking fights and ready to end it with her. Meanwhile, she has moved into his house, next door to his mom, and she has to leave now. We told her not to when she moved in. So, homeless daughter a 5 grands (16f, 15m, 12f, 9f, 6m), are moving in with us. It's going to be tight, but she's my kid, ya know? Now to the issue... I have a 12 year old mastiff, this is his place. She has 2, one year old pit males. I told her no dogs to begin with, then conceded to building them a kennel in back of the garage, away from my dog's area. She threw a total tantrum (which she does a lot) last night when she asked if they could come in to sleep with her upstairs at night! Well hell no they can't! I don't want them here at all, but I get it, you can't throw away a dog, but now I feel like I gave an inch and she wants a mile! I'll not let my grandbabies be homeless, but AITA for feeling like she's not in a situation where she should argue? She put herself where she is, we advised against everything that got her here. We're willing to help her, but I'm not endangering my old dog because she has nothing to do with hers.\nEDITED TO ADD: I feel like I need to add this, although she is batcrap crazy sometimes, my daughter has a full time job, pays her bills, takes good care of her kids, etc. The reason she has to come here is because the rentals in this area have skyrocketed, and she can't afford anything big enough for all of them on a single earner income. I don't even know how families with 2 incomes are doing it! So, she's going to stay here long enough to save up a down payment to buy her own home.  So she isn't completely irresponsible, she just does dumb crap without thinking of the consequences a little too often.\nOK FINAL EDIT:\nHere's what I've learned:\n 1) I am indeed NTA because I'm offering a reasonable solution. \n2) People are vary quick to decide that her life is somehow my fault, but it isn't. She has been living on her own since she was 17, we help, but we by no means support them. She does that on her own. We taught her to be a normal person, she went off the rails, and for the most part has had to deal with things herself, but I won't let anyone with my blood be homeless. Period.\n3) There's always one or two people who play the racist card, but no luck here, both guys would be the same POS's no matter their color. \nThank you all, I felt bad, I don't hate the dogs, I just can't have them here.", "created_utc": 1694432905, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16ft7pk/aita_grown_daughter_made_her_mess/", "score": 557, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She\u2019s saving for a house deposit. I don\u2019t know what you think having her dogs killed will do to improve her behaviour\u2026", "You didn't actually read the site you linked. Here's what it says if you scroll down to the breed-specific numbers: \n\nWhich dog breeds are the most dangerous?\u00a0\n\nA common question when it comes to dog bites is:\nWhich breeds are the most dangerous?\nThe AVMA or American Veterinary Medical Association conducted an in-depth literature review to analyze existing studies on dog bites and serious injuries. Their findings indicate that there is\u00a0no single breed that stands out as the most dangerous.\u00a0\nAccording to their review,\u00a0studies indicate breed is not a dependable marker or predictor of dangerous behavior in dogs. Better and more reliable indicators include owner behavior, training, sex, neuter status, dog\u2019s location (urban vs. rural), and even varying ownership trends over the passing of time or geographic location.\u00a0\nFor example, they note that often pit bull-type dogs are reported in severe and fatal attacks. However, the reason is likely not related to the breed. Instead, it is likely because they are kept in certain high-risk neighborhoods and likely owned by individuals who may use them for dog fights or have involvement in criminal or violent acts.\u00a0\nTherefore, pit bulls with aggressive behavior are a reflection of their experiences.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nWhich dog breeds bite the most?\u00a0\n\nAccording to research published in February 2019 examining\u00a0dog bite injuries\u00a0to the face,\u00a0dogs from 66-100 pounds with short, wide heads are most likely to bite.\u00a0\nThe study includes a review of literature from 1970 to the present day. Their research indicates that the top 6 breeds that are reported along with\u00a0bite injuries\u00a0are:\n\n\u201cUnknown\u201d\u00a0\n\nPit Bull\n\nMixed Breed\n\nGerman Shepherd\n\nTerrier\n\nRottweiler\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that these are based on reported biting. Often victims are less likely to report bites or attacks by smaller or medium-sized dogs because the damage isn\u2019t as severe.\u00a0\nHowever, that doesn\u2019t mean smaller breeds are less likely to bite.\u00a0\nSo take care and watch out for\u00a0signs of aggression\u00a0regardless of the dog\u2019s breed!\u00a0", "I'm shocked that the list for \"Which dog breeds bite the most\" wasn't topped by Chihuahuas!", "Responsible people won\u2019t get Pitt mixes? That\u2019s a wild claim. I am as responsible as they come, and my two pittie mixes are lovable doofs. \n\nThat being said, they are immensely powerful dogs with a lot of jaw strength. We recognize that and know that any dog can be pushed to attack, so we keep a close eye on them even though they have never behaved aggressively. ANY dog owner should do that, regardless of breed.", "Like me? You mean people that are trying to understand what this study actually looked at or if it even exists?", "It's not weird when you're already aware of the fact that [60%](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S109002331500310X) of \"pit bulls\" are misidentified and [62%](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0202633) of the dogs who do have dna that matches with the five pit bull breeds have less than 50% of it. It's especially not weird when you look at the study and see that the separate breeds are not accounted for. They're based on state-submitted statistics, where they have been proven to be unreliable at identifying dog breeds. They're not giving dogs DNA tests after they bite someone.", "Lmao....or?  Hide behind your keyboard, you have no idea how wrong you actually are about me....like I said, check your own racism, cause it ain't me....", "Let's not equate \"She shouldn't have pets if she can't afford housing for her children\" with \"Kill them with fire!\" shall we? You don't know their futures. Even if it doesn't look great. But she's not able to care for them so she shouldn't own them. That's all there is to this. And she needs to feel consequence to change.\n\nBut I'm commenting way less on the dogs than the owner. If I had to put money on whether these are well trained pits who aren't likely to bite or risky pets that haven't been properly cared for after hearing about her daughter I know where I put my bet.", "Agreed, my childhood pomeranian was more likely to bite. My pit mix is bossed around by a 3 pound rabbit. Not all pits are ferocious beasts", "I'm on my phone and not at home where it's on my desktop, but here's a [link from a law group](https://www.mkplawgroup.com/dog-bite-statistics/) ya know someone with s higher standard of evidence before they say some shit, and they also have the dog breeds that you guys keep saying are misidentified like bull mastiff and American bulldog. Also, personally as a Frenchman I'd never want to live in a country that allowed a dog with the bite force of half an African lion to walk around.", "No non-racists use the word hoodrat, even if they are describing a bad person, because they know its racist. \n\nHoodrat describes someone who was raised in a ghetto with no chance at a prosperous life. You use that word knowing full well what it means. You are a racist.", "Yes, the study separated that breed, but also has \"pit bull-type\" listed.
