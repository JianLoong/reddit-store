Why that didn\u2019t happen or was cut short you have no idea because you refuse to have that conversation. \n\nNow, you can severely fk with your child(because you do know that will be a MASSIVE upset to their little life, right?), or you can be an actual adult and have a conversation.", "And, you don't have any legal requirements to actually house voucher recipients? That sounds corrupt. \n\n\nYes, custody battles can be bad. So how does it look that you seemed okay with them going away for a month?

Also I\u2019m willing to bet it\u2019s more likely that she forgot to message you that her plans had changed. Y\u2019alls kid is only 3 months, and as someone with a 4 month old newborn myself (and with more help than shes getting) it is really hard to get adjusted to being the primary care taker of a newborn, especially depending on their temperament and if she\u2019s dealing with postpartum depression/anxiety on top of other postpartum issues. It is really concerning how your immediate reaction isnt \u201clet me see why she didnt go Im sure something happened\u201d but is instead \u201clet me kick her and our infant onto the street and then take her to court to completely steal our baby from her\u201d. YTA still", "Was she really squatting though, sounds like he gave her permission to stay as long as she needed?  Either way, it doesn\u2019t look good on him to evict her and file for custody.  It looks like he\u2019s using that power to take the child, which won\u2019t happen anyway. She should have communicated with him if her other rental fell through, but he\u2019s also not willing to have a conversation with her.  He\u2019s an AH for trying to take a newborn from its mother, as an uninvolved father.", "Yes, but they often aren\u2019t official until the couple has issues and they have to go to court. I\u2019m not sure about Ohio but in my state the court will take into account how care has been distributed even if it was \u201cunofficial.\u201d They won\u2019t just make the decision in a vacuum, they want to know what the status quo was, etc.\n\nI think we\u2019re reading different threads. Who says he can\u2019t see his kid? He never said he\u2019s seeking custody because she doesn\u2019t let him see his kid. If he said it downthread somewhere I missed it.\n\nAlso, who says she\u2019s homeless? He appears to give no shits about potentially making them homeless and letting her scramble for 30 days to find housing rather than just going to court for an emergency custody order which is what I think most people would do if they had genuine concerns about the kid\u2019s well being with mom. But it sounds like he hasn\u2019t actually discussed her housing situation with her yet and has no idea if she would be homeless if he puts her out of his place. I have no idea about Ohio but where I live (and formerly practiced family law/tried custody cases) if he contributes to her homelessness to get a leg up on custody it would go over like a ton of bricks in court.\n\nWe have nowhere near enough information about either one of them to know how a court would or should decide who gets primary physical custody. My point is he shouldn\u2019t try to change it just because he\u2019s annoyed with her. If he has concerns about her stability and ability to raise the kid, go for it. If she is actually preventing him from seeing his kid, go for it. But in my view he did not articulate that *at all* in his original post.\n\nBottom line, if they don\u2019t already have one, they need a custody order that fully addresses legal custody, physical custody/parenting time and child support. She needs a lease. I hope they all live happily ever after and if OP gets primary physical custody I hope you throw him a bitchin baby shower.", "She obviously doesn't know how to have adult conversations either.", "Why have you not pursued 50/50 custody at this point?", "She said she was going to a different state with the child to visit family. He said okay, because he saw the importance of her visiting her family. Meanwhile, she was local, and the kid was local.", "When he houses a voucher recipient there, then section 8 pays him money. If there's no section 8 tenant, he's not getting any section 8 money", "We have no idea how involved he was up until the point she said she was going to visit family for a few weeks. It sounds like he was toeing the line so that it wouldn't look bad on him while trying to get some custody. How do you think she's any more willing to have a conversation about the child than she is?\n\n\nBut he should be responsible for all her home bills, and lose money on a rental, while also paying complete child support?", "Because my baby isn't weaned yet. I will pursue 50/50 custody after he is.", "Yeah definitely should've let him know if there were change of plans but I'm also side eyeing him not contacting her for updates on the trip, like seeing if she arrived safely or updates on the child", "Do you not get any tax breaks for being section 8 housing?", "50/50 or full? Because isn\u2019t this whole post about how you want full custody?", "Honestly this kinda sounds like you want to evict her and want to find a way to get full custody and have whatever control you want. If she isn\u2019t abusive to your child and they have a healthy relationship then the worst thing you can do is remove a newborn or any child from their mother. Men don\u2019t understand half the time, but the bond with their mother is the most important in the beginning. Especially if she is the full time parent and you are in and out. \n\nMy fianc\u00e9 and I have a six month old baby. Most of the time she NEEDS  me to fix whatever is wrong. Her dad could try, grand parents can try, any one could try to figure out what\u2019s wrong with her and try to soothe her. Most of the time momma is what they need to be soothed. It\u2019s not Bc no one else knows how or they just don\u2019t try hard enough. I couldn\u2019t tell you how many times she would be so upset or fighting sleep and I\u2019m the only one who can soothe her. Sometimes it\u2019s almost instant relief when our chests touch and I\u2019m just holding her or rocking her. To remove your child from that bond is just going to hurt your child.", "YTA, you don't punish someone for some perceived misdeed by ripping away an infant from their mother AKA pushing for full custody. This makes me sick. You understand that child has a right to their mother, just as that mother has a right to their child? Your motivation does not sound like a compelling argument that a custody change would be in the child's best interest.", "YTA and you wouldn\u2019t get full custody. The child doesn\u2019t live with you now, what makes you think a judge would give you full custody? Because you were a great man and kicked the mother out making her homeless and try to take her child? Nah that just shows who you are. Gross.", "YTA. Why don't you communicate with your ex about the timeframe that you need her to move out of the Section 8 unit, or talk with her about the terms for renting it? There's no reason to go nuclear and evict her. She is still within the \"few months\" originally discussed, and you say nothing about a firm deadline to move. She's got a newborn kid. Perhaps the logistics of travel with a newborn or moving with a newborn were too complicated, so her needs have changed.    \n\n\nHer trip (or non-trip) is irrelevant, and I don't know why you think that you have a case for full custody, when you've apparently been out of regular communication.", "YTA for wanting to use your child as a weapon and sue for full custody just to be a petty AH, and not because it is actually in the best interest of your child.\n\nWho actually needs their mother.\n\nSo yeah.

Does she refuse to let you visit your child?", "Too much info is missing here.\n\nI'm not sure why your ex lied about going to Alabama.  Was she trying to cut you off from seeing your child by pretending they were out of state?  If that's the case, go ahead and go for full custody whether or not your ex has found a different place to live.\n\nIf there's some other more benign reason, and if you think your ex is a good mother who will be responsible in allowing you access to your child, then think about whether your really want full custody.  \n\nAsk yourself:  Are you prepared to be completely responsible for this child?  Do you plan to cut off her mother's access, which is almost never good for the child?  Are you doing this because you're pissed off about the apartment (which you have every right to be pissed off about), or because it's what's best for your kid?\n\nFinally, how does whether you ex finds new housing in the next 30 days have anything to do with whether you should have full custody?  Why would this turn on where your ex lives?", "NTA, her situation sounds sketchy, you'd think she'd at least communicate if any plans changed.", "Well she did tell him she was going to Alabama, I'm not sure why you'd think he'd be able to see his child if they were supposed to be in Alabama.\n\nThe child is 3-4 months old so as long as he was getting pictures or similar, it's not like a phone call was needed.", "Lmao clearly you\u2019ve never gone through family court. The courts don\u2019t care about lying.", "That\u2019s not true. People can be homeless and keep custody of their children.", "I\u2019m not buying your theory.
