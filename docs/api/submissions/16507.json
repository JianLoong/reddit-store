Maybe not. \n\nAre you entitled to financial help from your parents? No you aren't. \n\nAre you wrong to feel annoyed? You have the right to feel a way about it. \n\nAre you allowed to keep your parents' relationship at whatever distance you feel comfortable as a result? Absolutely. \n\nNTA", "NTA. \n\nThey are making it plainly clear that they value your sister's life over yours. My folks gave my younger sibling $150k to buy a house and nothing to the other two siblings. Actions speak volumes", "NTA - \"Might be an overreaction.\"  - It's not. They favored one child over the other. Money is a factual matter and they provided no logical reason for this decision. This sizeable gift would put most people ahead to secure large purchase. \n\nThis is hurtful. It may make you question why, did you do something wrong...etc. They are not obligated to give you money but once they grant a magical sum to her they should provide an explanation to you. This is how healthy relationships work.\n\nDon't avoid their inquiry. You matter. Consider: \"I haven't been in contact because your actions are hurtful. I can't make sense of your actions. You did not explain the reasons why you gifted my sister E70K for a home in addition to previous money support.  What did I do to you to be disrespected to this degree?\"   No one else can speak your words for you and making yourself small also does not serve you. I've lived through this and should have been crystal clear, based on facts, when the 1st incident occurred. Best to you!", "Not enough info here. What is their justification for giving your sister the money in the first place? \u00a370,000 (over $88,000 for us American types) is a buttload of money so I'm wondering they see you as self-reliant while viewing your sister as less able to support herself. \n\nI'm not giving you an NTA or YTA yet, I'd just like more background.", "That's a LOT of money they gave your sister. Maybe they *really* wanted to get rid of her!\n\nI'd ask them why they helped so much. But I fear you're being punished for competence - it happens a lot in families, I'm afraid. The parents will help the one who has nothing rather than the one who has worked hard and succeeded. 'She needs it more' is a bad excuse for favouritism.\n\nYou're NTA. Whether or not you resume contact with them depends on if you love them and want to see them. Only you can decide that.", "Don't wind up on the hook for their care when they get older. Or on the hook to help pay that new mortgage.", "E S H - Your parents don't \"owe\" you any help--you are an adult and capable of supporting yourself.  That being said, I can understand that such a massive gift to your younger sibling feels like you're being left out.  Is this a \"golden child\" situation, or is there some other reason why they would do this, because it's pretty blatant favoritism otherwise.\n\nEdit: Changing judgement to NTA based on further info.", "I don\u2019t think so to be honest.

Your parents suck. Keep doing it on your own and be rid of them.", "NTA. Welcome to what I call the \"success penalty\". My grandfather changed my inheritance because I \"did well for myself\" (I managed not to get divorced or knocked up, never needed a hand out whereas all my 4 siblings struggled). He split it with them. I have been a SAHM and have lots of med issues. Fast forward, I am the only sibling with 1 income and zero family support while that money gave them all but 1 a leg up and they are all now far better off financially than I am. We hope we'll be able to retire one day. Being punished for doing the right thing sucks. I'm sorry.", "That was my interpretation! OP, maybe you should move in with them and they'll realize you need help, too! NTA", "NTA.. perhaps you can move in with them to save the rest of what you need for a down payment", "This. NTA", "that's insane, how harsh..no disrespect.", "How did that end up with everyone\u2019s relationships?", "They wanted to help her become independent, though she hadn't made any effort to get there herself. I asked for a fraction of what they gave her (\u00a310,000) to top up what I'd already saved (\u00a330,000) to get things moving faster. They had to remortgage to help my sister but by their own admission had enough to not need to do that for me. They just said no because I'd get there on my own.", "I'm well aware of the situation and I'd never asked for anything. Far from it, when I was in my 20's I was giving them money to pay their bills. My sister had always lived at home whereas I moved out when I was 18. All that got me was that when I did ask for help I was refused, regardless of what happened before.", "This was my thought! OP moves in and becomes \u201cannoying\u201d, folks fork out the $$.  OP could save money faster living with the parents.  Two birds and all that.", "Whoa! Unless their house was already paid off, I feel that was an extremely poor financial decision. Now they have a second mortgage at a time of life when you want your monthly payments to be going down, not up. Is it possible they just don\u2019t have it?", "One more question: despite the fact that they have the money, would it be a financial burden for them to help you or would they have to give up anything like retirement or vacation plans?", "I'm totally puzzled as to where the folks who needed your money to pay their bills came up with this huge hunk of cash to just give to your sister.  Did they win a lottery or something?", "That is not all it got you. You earned everything you have and have a level of independence that your sister can\u2019t imagine (by the sounds of it). \n\nThat said I totally get why you are hurt.", "Their house was paid off until this. Between them they earn enough to take the extra debt from my sister and she would never be able to afford a house on her own. However, they said themselves that they wouldn't have to take more debt to help me, they just didn't want to as I'd eventually get there on my own.", "No, they remortgaged for my sister but they told me they had enough on hand to help me but that I didn't really need it.", "They racked up a lot of debt when they were younger that they've finished paying off now and both have well paying jobs.", "Well, even given all that, I'll start with the obligatory point that you don't have a \"right\" to get any money from your parents, but neither did your sister. There's an obvious double standard going on here.\n\nBasically, your sister needed a house, and they gave her a Boaty McBoatload of money, but when you need a house, they're stubbornly refusing to give you a fraction of the amount they gave her even though you need a house now too. That just doesn't make any sense. Whether you're more self-reliant or not, that doesn't change the immediate situation when you could really use the help. \n\nYou're NTA, but I would be careful about raising too much of a fuss, lest you start looking entitled. I don't think you would be entitled, but I can just see through my magic crystal ball that it will go down that way.", "And $5 says they haven't repaid what you gave them; am I right?  I'm changing my judgement.  That's crappy behavior.", "They repaid what they could but it was never the full amount."]}
