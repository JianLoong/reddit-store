When we allow this behaviour in our homes, it teaches kids it\u2019s normal and acceptable.\n\nWe protect children by holding adults accountable for their actions.", "Yeah, that's horrible behavior for an adult and he does not deserve any apologies.  The last thing you want to do is to condone that nonsense, especially around children. NTA.\n\nAnd, if you guys are Bills fans, then here's another NTA to you for still being mature enough to enjoy the game together anyway.", "NTA - he was not behaving appropriately, cant blame you for asking him to leave", "NTA - You politely pulled him aside and asked him to cool it, least to not swear. You told him how it was affecting everyone else. And he chose to continue. You did it the way anyone would say to reprimand a kid, you gave a warning, you explained the situation, and then the behavior didn't correct.", "NTA - Mike's expression does not trump the right of others who want to enjoy the game without yelling, crying, & swearing. Unfortunately people in the past supported his behavior so he and she view this as normal. There's a difference between an avid fan vs. being immersed in your own experience and unable to moderate outbursts and depth of emotions.\n\nYou had every right to talk to him. You explained why you asked him to change his behavior and he chose not to. The apology should come from Mike & your sister. Mike lacks social cues and awareness or he simply does not care. Good luck and know, this goes beyond your house, hour rules; he was an ass and your sister views this as okay.", "The worst thing about sport is the fans who behave as though a result is a life or death event for them personally. If that's his \"way of being a fan\" he needs to grow up. You put up with that asshole longer than I would have. NTA\n\nEdit to say, before anyone asks, I love sport, I'm an ex professional athlete myself and still a massive fan.", "NTA, he was being a terrible guest and a poor sport.  It's not like we didn't know the Cowboys were going to lose in dramatic fashion.", "Fans like that puzzle me.  Why are they so upset?", "Nta I bet he knew he acted like this and that's why he didn't come to begin with. \n\nIs he 3?", "NTA.

Err, was that baseball??\n\nYou talked to him and asked him to calm it down, especially not swear in front of the kids.  He didn't stop.  He needed to leave.  \n\nThere is targeting in football, however, and he deserved to be kicked out of the game, err house for his behavior.  Tell your sister Mike is welcome but he needs to bring his A game (not be an asshole) and behave (at least not swear with the kids there).", "NTA I can't help but wonder is he a gambler? I can't think of any other reason to lose one's composure so badly over a game other people are playing. especially when you're a guest at someone else's house.\n\n....to be fair, I'm a Sharks fan so I'm used to my team losing in the playoffs \ud83d\ude02", "I, too am a Bills fan. It was hard to watch that game. My husband also gets loud and aggressive with swearing at the tv. He wasn\u2019t with my yesterday thank goodness my youngest was sick on he couch during the game.

There\u2019s being a passionate fan, and there\u2019s being an adult throwing a temper tantrum that would make a toddler blush. He falls into the second category.", "NTA. He needs to have composure in the face of adversity. Also, as an Arizona Cardinals fan I\u2019ve learned over the years to be disappointed but never let it ruin your week. \n\nHe also has no business making people feel uncomfortable in their own home or cussing in front of the children. Sounds like he needs to find some other ways to deal with his emotions. I get that your sister wants to protect her fianc\u00e9 but she also has to understand that you can\u2019t witness a grown man throw a temper tantrum over a game without making everyone uneasy. I\u2019m sure she\u2019s hurt, but she\u2019ll get over it. As for him, get some help dealing with negative emotions or maybe lay off the alcohol (if that was a factor).", "NTA.  There's getting involved in the game and then there's completely forgetting your surroundings and thinking you're at the pub/in the stands, with your mates.  You gave him a warning and he still continued.  If it was just being a bit passionate, then fair enough, but going full swears and shouting, especially when there's kids around, is not cool behaviour.", "NTA. I'm a passionate fan but even live at a game I'm not like that.", "NTA. Your house your rules. You took him aside and asked him to stop swearing in front of your kids and he continued to do it anyways so in my opinion, NTA. I probably would have talked to the sister as well before kicking him out, but I also wasn\u2019t there to hear exactly what he was saying. I know a lot of sports fanatics, but I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever seen one cry out of anger during a game. Did drinking cause these outburst or does he just have some rage issues? Either way, not someone I\u2019d necessarily want around my kids.", "NTA Mike is a party pooper with that attitude. Can't be carrying on like that or even watching it in the same space as anyone else if you can't control your emotions.", "NTA. This guy wasn't thinking it through. Behaving so badly in front of a whole group of people... just not cool.", "NTA. A few years back I was at a Super Bowl party and one of our friends was acting like this - shouting, ranting and raving, pacing back and forth like a caged animal - and our team was winning! I was embarrassed for him, and I would have been embarrassed for your sister\u2019s fianc\u00e9 as well.", "NTA - when someone hosts a gathering and you attend, it is up to you to adjust your demeanor to that of the party.  If nobody is yelling, screaming, and swearing, then you would be out of place to do that.  If others are doing those things, then have at it.", "Was that his team as well? \nWas there alcohol involved?\n\nI just wonder why he \u201clost it\u201d", "NTA, the fact that your sister chose to spend her life with an overgrown baby doesn't mean you all have to as well. He can't behave like a proper grown up so he shouldn't attend family functions", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

His behavior was completely inappropriate. Especially, around children. He was a guest in your home and you had every right to ask him to leave.\n\nETA: Honestly, if I was your sister, I\u2019d be rethinking my engagement. Mike clearly has issues with regulating his emotions. I definitely wouldn\u2019t want to have kids and start a life with someone like this, because her statement to you makes it sound like this over-the-top reaction is the norm for him.", "NTA. You\u2019re not the one who owes apologies. Drop the guilt. You did nothing wrong.", "NTA! Nothing else to add.", "NTA. If this is how Mike watches the game, that's fine, but he can do it as his house. This was a family event, and a certain level of decorum is expected. Just tell your sister that you can understand Mike is very passionate about his team, but his behavior just wasn't appropriate for the situation and he didn't tone it down enough even after being confronted with the problem. For the sake of family harmony, I would just tell her that you are sorry it ended the way it did, but Mike is welcome to come to another family event and this time it won't be football so there shouldn't be any more problems. Maybe have a nice family dinner, invite everyone, and try to smooth this over...", "NTA, but your sister is for enabling and defending his behavior in your home. They both owe all of you apologies for this and fianc\u00e9 needs to act like an adult when he is at other peoples homes.", "NTA. He\u2019s a grown ass man literally throwing a screaming, crying temper tantrum over a game.

Sheesh!", "NTA your house your rules, you asked him to abide by them, he didnt, so you asked him to leave. He owes the apology if he wants to come back, not the other way around. It was the guests behaviour that was out of line, not the hosts, so you don't need to apologise.", "NTA. \"His way of being a fan.\" The dude doesn't even know how to regulate his emotions over a simple game. I would be super worried instead of acting like he is being bullied.", "NTA there\u2019s a time and a place. I can let the first bit of behavior go because he didn\u2019t know that your family doesn\u2019t watch quite like he does\u2026 But after your asked him to pull back? Yeah he should have adjusted.  Reminds me of a friend\u2019s mom who eventually agreed to stop watching because she was scaring their kids so bad with her antics.", "NTA and seriously it\u2019s just a game, he has some serious problems and it sounds like you\u2019re sister is ignoring them", "NTA\n\nMaybe he has a gambling problem.", "NTA, being around someone like that is the freaking worst during a game.  My buddy's brother is like that sometimes and he had to get on him to control it, now we all have a good time.  It's ok to be upset, but so is everyone else..and it's easier to take that loss when you're at least with friends having a good time.", "NTA. It\u2019s pretty reasonable to expect that even with a beloved team, people will keep their behavior in check when watching with people they don\u2019t typically watch with. If he wanted to be in a space where he could be more freely emotive, it would have been better to watch with his buds or whatever is typical for him. \n\nHe had a chance to listen and modify his behavior after you aired your concerns and he chose not to. As a parent you\u2019ve got to stick with the boundaries you need for your kids. Asking him to leave was a great demonstration that there are consequences for actions, even as an adult, and that nobody is exempt from behaving good.", "We\u2019ve learned over the years to enjoy the downs almost as much as the ups. After 30 years I\u2019m still just happy for any playoffs at all.", "This exactly. It sounds like he doesn't have any children of his own, he needs to change the way he acts in front of other people's children.", "I think only the fans are allowed to cry.", "Gambling is frowned upon by my parents, so if he was he wouldn\u2019t be talking about it. It\u2019s possible but given my sisters stance on it it seems unlikely.", "It is his team as well. There was alcohol but none of us are heavy drinkers, and he couldn\u2019t have had more than 2 beers.", "I grew up with relatives like him then, no real stakes in the games but unable to control their emotions during them. Screaming, crying, melodramatic roller coasters, I've seen it but I just don't get it. Though now I'm thinking of all the pandemonium non-US football fans can cause and maybe I'm just the wrong person to answer this one. \n\nBut at the end of the day, no matter the situation, he was a guest who was unable to control himself after being asked to by the host. He is without a doubt TA here.", "Cowboys fans LOL", "As a footballfan myself(you\u2019d call it soccer, although I like your football as well) I like to get \"rowdy\" when I\u2019m watching a match, but only in the correct setting, ie when I\u2019m with my friends at the pub or when there aren\u2019t children or pets around. I have no problems watching a game in a calm and collected way when that\u2019s what the setting calls for. \"Mike\" not doing so despite being told more than once has noone to blame but himself, and OP\u2019s sister is up for disappointment if she keeps making excuses for his misbehaviour.
