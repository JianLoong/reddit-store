YTA.  give it up.  move on.  stop telling your sister this stuff.", "People\u2019s entitlements to names is just wild.

It\u2019s also a name I wanted to use before I knew she wanted it too. Guess who had a girl and guess who didn\u2019t. Guess who\u2019s done having kids and won\u2019t ever get to use it. It\u2019s such a petty thing. Of course I didn\u2019t use it for my daughter, and I love the name I chose so much more. Move on and choose something else. Don\u2019t ruin your relationship with your sister over a name for a nonexistent child.", "Use this to your advantage:  tell someone else (cousin/friend) that you are so glad sister took this name so she can't name him the name you REALLY want (insert alternate name here).  Lay it on thick that you originally wanted the name but you fell out of love with it awhile ago but kept the guise going to throw sister off the track as she's continually copying you, even as far as throwing a tantrum about the name and telling her to change it.

Isn\u2019t that hilarious???\u201d  By acting unaffected, you take away her power - your little sister is still trying to get your attention, don\u2019t reward her bad behavior.", "YTA. \n\nIn order to claim a name, the baby has to be actually conceived and incoming. It sucks that you\u2019ve been fantasizing about this name for years, but there\u2019s plenty of fish in the sea in regards to name. \n\nIt\u2019s weird she\u2019s picking a name unrelated to her culture, but this happens all the time. So many people use names outside their culture. \n\nI recommend r/namenerds and finding a new ideal name", "Imagine if you never told your sister about that name but she still picked it by herself.\n\nIf you have a boy later, are you really going to NOT name him what you want simply because your nephew already has that name?\n\nIt seems like you are just frustrated at her copying (which can be annoying, sure), but there are no rules against two boys in the family having the same name (in fact, they'll probably think it's fun and cool when they grow up).\n\nYTA", "You can't call dibs on a name... Just stop talking to this creature already... E S H. Her for being a weirdo. You for knowing she's a weirdo & still interacting with her. Shocking! The weirdo copy cat is copying you!! Cut her off. She can't copy what she doesn't know about. \n\n\nAlso - let her name her white ass kid Jesus. She won't have any real story behind it & there's no way this is the only aspect of her life she's a little weirdo in so it'll be funny!! \n\n\nI'm sorry you got your name snaked that does suck. My ex best friend named her kid Wyatt right after I told her that's what my kiddo would be called. (we were pregnant at the same time, her a few months ahead.) So I had to pick a different name. Now we don't talk & her other kids names are nothing like that so I think it's kind of funny. Her childs name probably reminds her of someone who won't speak to her anymore. \n\n\nMy real ruling is NTA for being upset but realistically there's nothing you can do about it. Maybe keep the name? It makes more sense for you & if people ask you just tell the truth. \"I made the mistake of telling my swimfan sister my baby name & she took it. I'm sick of her taking my stuff/ideas so I've decided to not let her actions dictate mine.\" \n\n(Swimfan is a movie about a creepy lil stalker weirdo so it's an appropriate nickname for your sister LOL)", "Her kid, her choice.

If you push the issue, you would be.\n\nIt is her decision what to name her child.\n\nWhat would be interesting is for you to have a boy and give him the same name. As your boy would have a Mexican papa and hers doesn't, I imagine she'd have an interesting time explaining to people why she gave her kid a Mexican name. As for you, having planned to use the name for a decade makes a good deal of sense. Folks can decide what to make of it as they will. ;)", ">She said that I might not even have a boy and that it\u2019s her decision what she names her child.\n\nShe is right about that.

Her for copying you to the point of stealing your thunder at times, and you for thinking you can reserve a name for a child who has not even been conceived yet.", "YTA. Who cares if both of you have sons with the same name? It appears that she may have some jealousy issues. This is not something worth getting upset about. Nobody owns a right to exclusive use of a name. Besides, you might never have a boy. Your request seems petty and jealous, too.", "YTA: Your sister is correct it\u2019s up to her and her partner what their baby name is and again correct as you might not ever have a boy. \n\nYou can\u2019t call dibs on names of children who don\u2019t exist.

So you knew better than to tell her something like this.", "ESH you can't call dibs on names and don't sit on something or 10 years and expect no one else will snatch up the property. But she is a bad sister too because seems deliberate/insensitive. Don't buy her a baby gift/attend the baby shower/celebrations (the kid will never know anyway). Let her know she crossed a line. Then forgive her once the kid turns 1 (and starts forming memories) if you're interested in knowing your nephew.

You have zero ownership to a name, and frankly you sound racist as hell.", "ESH\n\nYour sister for her obvious pettiness. \n\nYou for trying to claim a name. It's not yours.

Surely no human with a young child already has time to create such stupid, useless squabbles with a close relative. I mean, that would just be *stupid*, right? The world is full of cousins with the same name.

Tell her you're doing that and you'll leave it up to her to explain to her white kid with the white dad the origin of his name and why he has the same name as his cousin. \n\nDepending on your family dynamic, you or your husband could mention the weirdness of it to her husband. Maybe you could squeeze a veto out of him. That's a long shot, though. Unless there's some kind of past between him and your sister and that's why she's naming her kid the same name he wants for his son.", "ESH. Neither of you own that name. You can give your son the name anyway, nothing wrong with cousins sharing a name.
