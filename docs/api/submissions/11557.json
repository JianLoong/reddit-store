I (21f) have been my his side the entire time. I have more or less become his caregiver. \n\nIn the last month I have taken over the role of keeping our house together. I cook all the meals. I take care of the pets. I stay up all night to tend to his endless needs. I take him to the bathroom. I have been working remote. I haven\u2019t left the house for more than an hour since the accident (aside from taking him to and from appointments). I am not saying this to complain, I am grateful that my life allows for me to support him the way I have.  \n\nMy problem is his attitude. He was given very strong pain killers for the first two weeks after surgery. He had to extend his time on them and recently stopped taking them in the last week. When he was taking them, he thanked me, told me how much he loved me, apologized at every step, though he didn\u2019t need to. Without the meds he doesn\u2019t seem to see that I am helping him. Every dish I bring him is the wrong one, he will yell for me and when I come he will tell me to \u201cfuck off\u201d if he\u2019s in pain he expects me to fix it. I am exhausted. I can\u2019t do anything right and it is wearing on me. I haven\u2019t slept in weeks. I haven\u2019t seen a friend or family member in way too long. I can\u2019t even be on the phone for more than 10 minutes without it being an issue. \n\nAfter days of what turned into verbal abuse, I called my MIL. I told her everything as soon as I saw he was asleep. I cried for about 15 minutes. I felt terrible unloading on her like that, but I had so much built up frustration I just couldn\u2019t stop. She was very supportive on the phone, let me know I wasn\u2019t wrong to feel like that., and let me cry. After hearing everything she was furious and ended our call to talk to her son. She tore him an new asshole. I heard him trying to defend himself through the door but it was mostly just stammering. \n\nShe flew up yesterday and put me up in a nice hotel. I haven\u2019t heard much from my fianc\u00e9 since I left but as I was leaving he was yelling at me for calling his mom, he said he didn\u2019t want to marry someone who couldn\u2019t be there for him in sickness. I told him I loved him and I was sorry, I am just so tired. He didn\u2019t care and just told me to go, and his mom could do a better job for him then I ever could. \n\nSo now I\u2019m in my way too nice hotel room, feeling like a major AH. I need to know if I am wrong here.\n\nEdit- He began weaning off two weeks ago and became fully dependent on over the counter medication this week. He did not stop taking them cold turkey. His doctors were heavily involved too, due to previous drug abuse.", "created_utc": 1678042844, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11j7rob/aita_for_calling_my_mil_on_my_fianc\u00e9/", "score": 692, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She sounds great.", "NTA Repeat after me, caregivers need to take care of themselves. You were at your breaking point and asked for help. Depending on the painkillers, he may bring going thru some withdrawal issues which is no excuse for your fiance's vile behaviour. You did not nothing wrong. If my son treated his fiance so badly she broke down on the phone to me, I would straighten his ass out too.", "NTA It\u2019s \u201cin sickness and in health,\u201d not \u201cthrough abuse and through toxicity.\u201d", "NTA. While I appreciate he is in pain, that's no excuse for being a dick to the person who's put their life more or less on hold to care for him. Good on your MIL for backing you up.", "You just got a taste of your life together, a real behind the scenes.. you've done nothing wrong here and I would urge you to take this time away to reflect on your relationship and what you want moving forward.  NTA", "NTA. Caregiver fatigue is a very real thing and though you're doing your best, you're not his nursemaid. As a nurse, I'm very curious what surgery he had that doesn't allow him to go to the bathroom by himself after a full month. Your fiance is likely feeling weak and vulnerable and is taking his feelings out on you, which isn't right. When a healthy person is suddenly debilitated it can really hit their self esteem and cause shame. But that's an internal battle he needs to confront on his own. Most surgeries want people up and walking and doing normal things as quickly as possible so it sounds like he's malingering a lot.", "NTA - this man doesn\u2019t need to be your fianc\u00e9. leave him as soon as you can. accidents are what they are accidents. accidents happen all the time, who is to say this is the last accident he\u2019ll have?\n\nif you feel like you \u201ccan\u2019t do anything right\u201d to a person you\u2019re wanting to spend the rest of your life with, then you should leave. \n\nYour fianc\u00e9 is mentally mature enough to not have abusive behavior, there\u2019s only so much a mother can do about their sons behavior once the son is out the house. \n\nYour MIL won\u2019t be there forever. Hate to say that but it\u2019s true. If she weren\u2019t there in this scenario, you have to ask yourself what would you do? \n\nYou haven\u2019t slept.

I go to his mom when he's being unreasonable because unlike my own, she will still love him. I think it's great you went to his mom for two reasons: 1. While she may be mad at him, it's not going to change the fact that she loves him. Your family/friends would be more likely to change their viewpoints of him. 2. It is so awesome that you have the type of relationship with his mom that you could go cry to her. \n\nAs previously stated,  ditch him but keep her.  She sounds like a winner.  NTA.", "Sounds like he's going through withdrawal from the pain meds.", "NTA but I would hold off marrying this man, if at all.", "NTA.  Your MIL is cool and your husband is acting like a spoiled brat.", "NTA but your fianc\u00e9 sounds like he\u2019s showing his ass, and that\u2019s disturbing.", "NTA, and that's an awesome MIL. Family helps family, when you reach your breaking point it's really nice to have someone step up and fill in.", "NTA. It doesn't take long to get addicted to opioid painkillers and then suffer from withdrawal if they are discontinued. As long as he was on the painkillers, he was feeling generous and appreciative. Once they were withdrawn, the reality of his situation seemed intolerable and he started taking it out on you because...well, he could. You were an available target. This kind of behavior towards a caregiver is more common than you think.\n\nYou did the right thing to get away from the situation before it got worse. His mother is better able to handle him, at this point. A person can only take so much.\n\nGive it some time and just keep an open mind and see what happens. He may see the error of his ways, or the relationship might be damaged beyond repair. Just be glad you're not married and can step away fairly easily, if you decide not to stay in the relationship.", "NTA - you needed help. So you called the person who likely understood how he behaves when in pain.\n\nWhat you did was a matter of self preservation of sorts. You held firm in that you would not accept this behavior towards you. Nobody should!\n\nAt this point in life, maybe his mother is the one that needed to explain to him in not so many words, that this isn\u2019t how she raised him.", "NTA. Your bf might have been through a traumatic accident but that\u2019s no reason for you to put up with verbal and emotional abuse especially when you\u2019re doing so much to help make his life easier. \n\nI\u2019m tempted to think that he\u2019s reacting like this due to trauma and maybe any other mental issues that have surfaced after his accident but you shouldn\u2019t have to bear the brunt of it all alone. You were completely right to reach out for help and you did the best thing by reaching out to his own mother.\n\nIf he reckons his mum can do a better job than you then leave him to it, he doesn\u2019t deserve the support you were giving.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nbut regarding your husband, is he generally this abrasive or is this new behaviour? cause it's very easy to get angry and everything and everyone when you're in paid or feeling incapable", "NTA - but you've gotten a glimpse of your fianc\u00e9's lack of empathy and compassion.  Please strongly reconsider if you want to marry a man capable of talking to you like this and treating you like he did.", "NTA and hurray for a just yes MIL. You were a loving and caring partner and injured or not yet he was being an abusive AH to someone caring for him. Enjoy your hotel room., you deserve it.", "NTA MIL needs a huge thank you. She's fucking awesome. Your fiance is probably in withdrawals and that isn't the same person you love. Keep an eye open on your return door and self medicating or alternative addiction habits just to be safe", "NTA\n\nLeave the fianc\u00e9, take the mom.", "NTA\n\nIt sounds like he's in both pain and possibly withdrawal maybe depression and being horrible. \n\nHis mom sounds great and recognizes his behaviour is unacceptable.\n\nHopefully he can get whatever help he needs and you can move past. IMO the next step is in sickness and health but he needs to want to get better.", "NTA\n\nCaregiver burnout is real.  Hopefully his mother can stay a while, and the two of you can take turns caring for him and having some sort of break.\n\nYou also need to contact his doctor about his pain medication.  He can't stay on it forever, but stopping it as abruptly as he did clearly is not working.  He may need the same medication at a lower dose, or a different medication (e.g., changing from tylenol with codeine to plain tylenol) Pain is a real thing, and needs to be managed. He may benefit from consulting with a pain specialist, who can help him find a pain management treatment that will help him but not risk addiction or bad side effects.\n\nYou may also want to get in contact with the specialist for his injuries, who can evaluate to see if the surgery is healing properly or if secondary problems are developing.\n\nGet some sleep, and then have a talk with him and his mother about the way the lack of pain management is harming him and making it hard to care for him.\n\nETA - he may also need an inpatient rehab center, where he can work with physical therapists and other specialists to facilitate his recovery.", "It surprising to me how the MIL reacted. I feel like a lot of moms think their kids can do nothing wrong. \n\nNTA though...we all have our limits of what we can handle.", "NTA, I am a caregiver for my spouse as well due to illness. It is so draining and so upsetting and difficult, and he isn\u2019t an asshole. If he was I don\u2019t know how I\u2019d go on. I would honestly be rethinking the marriage if he doesn\u2019t change the way he treats you", "NTA. This is what life with him will be. Pain will happen in life, and now you know how he reacts. Is this the life you want? \n\nAs so many others have said, drop him, keep his mom", "NTA, seems maybe he was becoming dependent on the pain killers and when he stopped he was suffering from withdrawal. \n\nCare takers need rest too, asking for help is not a sign of you don't love him, but a sign that you needed a break", "NTA \n\nYou aren\u2019t required to tolerate or cover up his bad behavior.  Being there for someone in their time of need doesn\u2019t mean you have to do everything yourself, be there 24/7, and take their abuse. \n\nI think both of you have taken on too much by yourselves.\n- He is in a lot of pain. That can make the best people pretty cranky.\n- Perhaps he\u2019s suffering some withdrawal symptoms from his meds, perhaps not.  Either way he\u2019s not managing well right now.  That means he needs to see the doctor about pain management.\n-  Where are your fiends and family?  I\u2019m glad you called your MIL, but even when your fianc\u00e9 was being nice, you were still doing a lot by yourself IMO.  Ask for help and don\u2019t feel bad about it.  You need it.", "Nope NTA. MIL sounds like a gem.", "One of the rare occasions on this thread where the MIL isn\u2019t at fault. NTA and good on you and her for standing up to your fianc\u00e9e. Also you should probably not marry him.", "NTA - you were there for him in sickness. Just not for abuse. Do you think he\u2019s struggling not taking the painkillers? People can definitely be assholes when in pain. Not an excuse, just if things calm down and he\u2019s very sorry, you can understand the why later on to ensure it doesn\u2019t happen again. Then again if he is simply being an ah there\u2019s probably not much to understand\u2026", "NTA sounds like you dodged a bullet.", "NTA give him the ring back and leave. You don't deserve to be treated so poorly", "NTA. Some people are really bad patients.   Crisis situations show what people are made of. You step up, effectively manage what needs to be done, even to your own detriment. He becomes demanding and has unreasonable expectations.  As a person with chronic pain issues myself, I can understand being short tempered during a pain flare, but you apologize after the fact when you can clearly see the whole situation again. He\u2019s just acting like a baby. Calling Mommy is reasonable.   \n\n\nHis mother sounds like a keeper !  Supportive emotionally and a take charge woman. Yay !", "Nta but I would give him time to apologize. It really does sound like opioid withdrawal and it is a very nasty thing and situation. Give it a week or two with him clean and see how he responds. If he still wants to be a child, dump him", "NTA. Although caring for others is admirable and often necessary, you really have to consider the long haul on this one. You have had a really good glimpse of what to expect from this guy in the future when something else happens. Because it will.\n\nRun like the wind in the other direction. Run fast and far away.  There is no law that states you must endure the abuse. \n\nMIL is a gem, but not enough reason to stay.", "NTA, but you have to realize a few things. First, he was no doubt prescribed opioids, which he took for an extended time.   This means that if he just stops taking them, he'll go through full blown withdrawal symptoms, which are quite intense with opioids. It'll literally make you behave completely unlike yourself without being aware of it. Try slowly reducing the dose over time.  Second, venting to his mom could be seen as a betrayal, like you're ratting him out.  It may be better to turn to someone else in the future. \n\nSo no, NTA, you hit your breaking point which was most certainly reasonable.  But perhaps try to have better situational awareness going forward.", "INFO is he withdrawing/addicted to the pain killers?", "NTA. Just because you're a caretaker doesn't mean that you have to neglect your own needs. Even live in nurses get breaks. I'm glad you called his mom and I'm extra glad that she came to your rescue. Take your well deserved rest and don't communicate with him. Let his mom keep you up to date until he's willing to apologize for his behavior and show you he won't go into that again.", "NTA. He needs to own his own behavior.", "Not the asshole but if you had to call his mom because you don\u2019t know how to communicate that he\u2019s being exhausting i think it\u2019s very evident that y\u2019all are too young and immature to get married", "No assholes here.\n\nAlthough your fiancee is acting like one. He is frustrated that he can't do anything and probably experiencing drawbacks from the meds. You are the only one he can vent to and he does in a very inappropriate way. Good that you got help, hope he feels better soon. You need to talk to him about it that this isn't the way to go. \n\nYou need well deserved rest and he needs to find a way to properly deal with emotions.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Keep to ourselves and apologize when we can't. If, and I have no reason to doubt you, his doctor weaned him off the drugs appropriately, he's an AH.

Calling his mom to ask for some help would have been fine and understandable. Calling his mom to unload and have her come in and take charge of your relationship is unhealthy and not respectful. There\u2019s a fine line between reaching out and overstepping, and I think you overstepped on this. \n\nBTW pain pills and withdrawal from pain pills could absolutely cause your boyfriend\u2019s extremely abusive behavior. The hospital should have warned you. If you choose to stay in this relationship, see if there is a social worker at the hospital that can help you and your boyfriend both recognize the side effects of opiates and opiate withdrawal, or perhaps the doctors office has someone you can talk to.  There\u2019s always a chance that he\u2019s just a dick and being injured exposed this side to him, but there\u2019s also some likelyhood that the pain pills are causing the mood swings and bad temper, and they can have that effect for weeks after you stop taking them.", "I second this.... Toss the fianc\u00e9, keep MIL.", "This is a distinction that needs to be highlighted more often.\n\nETA NTA", "He's going through intense opiod withdrawal without intentionally getting himself addicted.   He needs to wean off instead.  This isn't a \"leave him\" scenario, or an indicator of anything personal to him at all.", "NTA, I was going to say the same thing. Sudden withdrawal from opioids can cause irritation, he is clearly irritated. Being a good caretaker means taking care of yourself as well. Rest, pick up some takeout when you are fully rested, and take it home to your MIL and finace'.", "NTA  Yeah. Marry the mil. being a caregiver for your partner is way harder than most understand. I was one for 19 years. \nYou've done a great job. Enjoy the rest. Mom will straighten him out. He will get over himself.", "He was on opiates, he didn\u2019t quit cold turkey and he claims to not be feeling withdrawal, just pain. I appreciate the pain, I really do. I understand he\u2019s hurting. I am trying so hard to put myself in his shoes and I simply can\u2019t. I honestly wish it was withdrawal and I knew I would have him back in a week or so. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s what this is.", "He has a history of drug abuse, I took administration of the pills very seriously.

Genuine question and is that a common thing for people prescribed opioids? \n\nI do want to specify that I have had surgery once on my chest. I got prescribed oxy and i only used them when i needed them. Which was rarely. \n\nI kinda need more info, OP kind of made it seem like he was taking pills sometimes and then he just automatically stopped during the duration of them?", "OP has now said in other comments he has a short temper and a history of verbal abuse even when he is sober. That's where the flags be a wavin", "It sounds like withdrawals to me. Its not easy to admit you\u2019re dealing with an addiction, especially when it comes to something like opioids which is so heavily stigmatized. Take a week off, get some good rest, and talk with him once you both have had a chance to cool off. Drugs do crazy things to people and turn them into people they\u2019re not - hopefully he will come out of this with a new appreciation of why drugs can be so scary and a resolve to be more careful with prescription meds in the future", "Its absolutely withdrawal.    He's never behaved like this in his life, suffers a massive injury that takes months of recovery, gets put on opioids and takes them for an extended time, and then turns into a monster when he stops taking them?

The withdrawal from that is crazy intense and well beyond a person's ability to control, physically and mentally.   He's essentially a heroin addict at that point. \n\nIt doesn't excuse his behavior or make it so she doesn't need help in dealing with him, but its not even the slightest indicator of any underlying truth of who he is.", "He behaves like this frequently when in pain, just never to this degree. I can promise you that he had been weaned off and would tell me if that\u2019s what he was feeling. I have seen him go through much worse withdrawals when we first met and this isn\u2019t that. He is lashing out on me in pain, which I get. I was the only person around.", "He has what some would call a short fuse. Especially with me. Him saying hurtful remarks to me or just blatantly putting me down is not necessarily uncommon and is something we are working on. Prior to this he would apologize and make it up to me, now even when I\u2019m in tears he will just keep laying on insults.", "When he's being pretty much abusive in basic interactions, that's an unrealistic expectation. He's clearly in withdrawal, that's not a maturity thing.", "Being with him through his abusive remarks is not part of being with someone \u201cin sickness and in health.\u201d His injury is not the problem here - his behavior is. \n\nHim having a \u201cshort fuse\u201d is not a quirk or a character trait, and him apologizing after doesn\u2019t make it ok. If this is \u201cnot necessarily uncommon\u201dthen you shouldn\u2019t marry him until he gets some help. This is abuse, and not something you should tolerate. \n\nI usually don\u2019t agree with tattling to others about your significant others, but the fact that you felt the need to do so tells you that something is deeply wrong with this relationship and this situation just brought it more clearly to the surface. \n\nNTA. And please don\u2019t marry this person until the hurtful remarks and blatant put downs stop.", "Honeyyyy he is showing you what he is like when things are not good. He's insulting you and blaming you for it. Please get a therapist for yourself and work on building yourself up emotionally. It's not healthy for someone to treat you this way and it's not healthy for you to try to \"stick it out\" while he's \"working on it.\" \nIt also sounds like you were isolated from friends, family and you could barely communicate on your phone \"without it becoming an issue\". That is very concerning. This month was an escalation.", "They clearly had to get an actual adult to fix the situation, him not being able to process his injury and regressing to being a tantrum toddler is immature, her repressing how\u2019s it\u2019s been making her feel until the point that she\u2019s bursting into tears at his mom is immature, these are children thinking they\u2019re ready for marriage which is very immature", "Either you're not capable of understanding this is about addiction, or you're choosing not to, but either way, you do you.", "Nvm I asked what was he like before the accident? Was his behaviour then closer to loved up drugged up gratitude or cursing and belittling you?\n\nNow I see your comments about his usual behaviour and short fuse so you're now getting an amplified version because he's also in pain.\n\nI don't know what to tell you - NTA, certainly, and kudos to his mother for ripping into him, it's well deserved, but if this is a regular thing you shouldn't be desensitizing yourself to it. You don't deserve his behaviour now or before, and you certainly shouldn't be planning to marry him. He's abusing you and is currently using his accident and injuries to drive the knife deeper.\n\nThis is your next 30-50 years. You really want to spend them getting yelled at and insulted?", "NTA but your MIL is great! Postpone the wedding for a while to see if he keeps treating you badly.", "NTA, despite being injured he sounds like a narcissist.

Good luck", "Hopefully he will be better once the withdrawal goes through. I was on painkillers after a surgery. While I avoid taking them if I can, after a month when I stopped was nasty. Couldn't sleep, pain, weakness, restless legs. And that was only taking a pill when I absolutely needed them.

Good rock hard solid advice right over there!", "Not to mention the throwaway line there at the end, \"...due to previous drug abuse\". I bet that being on the Good Med for 2 weeks did something to him, and he's currently in withdrawal.

She had no blinders to her son's faults, but her love for him was unconditional. There is always a risk when you vent to your own friends and family. While my SO and I may forgive each other's transgressions pretty quickly, our nearest and dearest might hold a grudge on our behalf. I always knew that his Mom was going to let it go, as long as I was ready to forgive.", "She edited to add that he has a history and they weened him off. I'd bet they stopped them earlier than usual since he's had a problem before. I know a couple people with a history of pill addictions and they won't touch opioids for anything.

I quickly said that I didn't want to press charges; he explained that it was the law, not my choice.  My ex was arrested.\n\nMy ex BIL emailed me asking why I  went to the police...\n\nI hope you are well, and I'm so sorry you were treated that way.", "Run. He will not get better.  NTA except to yourself.", "Obviously NTA.  He has a mother to be his caretaker for his many problems that existed before and after the accident. Are you sure that marrying this person is best for you at this time?", "If that's the case then you don't need this. You deserve better than being treated so poorly. Enjoy your time in the hotel and consider this relationship very carefully.", "NTA - and he sounds like exactly the man to leave you when you need help, saying its too much for him but burden you with everything in his life", "Nta", "By no means are you to blame. He doesn't sound like a guy with the mental capabilities required to be called a MAN. Life's a hard mess and injuries heal. Put in the work and show some respect you your fianc\u00e9 or have the decency to quietly close the door behind you when you leave. That's my opinion anyway.", ">Edit- He began weaning off two weeks ago and became fully dependent on over the counter medication this week. He did not stop taking them cold turkey. His doctors were heavily involved too, **due to previous drug abuse.**\n\n# UH OH SPAGETTI-OH!\n\nThis is not previous drug abuse. These are the actions of an addict. He went off the pain meds and became hostile and abusive to you. Hate to say it, but if you do stay with this guy watch for rebound substance use after using pain meds. It's a thing. Now, he's using OTC meds but they have limited potency. Watch for him \"medication seeking\", going to one or more doctors for pain meds, and even coming up with new sources of pain long after the pain from this surgery should have been resolved. Now, that said, I have known people with terrible back injuries and they struggle daily with trying to manage pain and not become addicts. BUT, if this is not a case of chronic pain, watch for the signs. If he weans off the OTC meds and stops treating you like crap (and is remorseful for it) you might chalk that up to what he went through. Be aware, however, that this could be the tip of the ice-burg for a relapsing addict.\n\nAlso too, if his previous addiction issues were with sedatives, pain meds, heroin, oxycodone, opiates or other similar drugs, look out. The pain meds and OTC meds could have him well on the road to using the hard drugs again. Pain meds can do this to people who once suffered from addiction. Pain meds can cause this in people *who have never been addicted* too!\n\nOh, and you're definitely NTA. Neither is he. He's just an addict.\n\nGood luck. To both of you.", "God bless your MIL for saving you from this situation. These are all massive red flags. He appears to be struggling with his addiction, and clearly has an abusive side.  His mom is teaching you by showing you what you need to do to set boundaries. If you have any access to counseling services, I encourage you to take advantage of that option. Even just a couple of sessions will help you in your decision making going forward. Good luck.", "NTA\nBut is it possible he's going through withdrawals from the meds? I'd be speaking to the Dr in charge of his care", "NTA, you did an amazing job and he was an ungrateful arsehole about.\n\nYes he is in pain, but you don't have to do this alone.  I'm sure his parents actual want to help him.\n\nDon't marry him until this is resolved to your satisfaction, including a massive apology.  but honestly his behaviour should give you pause on marrying him.", "NTA. Tell your fianc\u00e9 you do not want to marry a man that emotionally and verbally abuses you when he is sick, or when things get tough. \n\nHe may be going through withdrawal, but he certainly knows he won\u2019t get away with his BS with his mom. He\u2019s only mad, because you exposed him.", "NTA. Good thing he has a good mother. You have to ask yourself if you really want to be treated that way. Choose better for yourself! Even if he\u2019s in pain, you don\u2019t deserve that!", "NTA no excuse to treat someone like garbage. Taking care of someone is a lot of hard work. The least they can do in return is treat you nicely.", "NTA. You desperately needed a break and your wonderful mother-in-law made sure you got one. Coming off painkillers means he\u2019s in pain, and he might be in withdrawal, too, and both of those things can make people irritable. Which is not an excuse, and I am glad that you are in a nice hotel right now relaxing and I hope ordering room service. But once he is in less pain and out of withdrawal, and his behaviour is back to normal, then you can assess the situation better. What he was doing was emotionally abusive, and he needs to know that no matter what the excuse, abuse is unacceptable and you won\u2019t put up with it.", "NTA\n\nTrust your future MIL.

Good for you for standing up for yourself and calling out for help.", "No, OP is a sweet angel, and definitely NTA. This guy need a reality check.", "NTA You are amazingly supportive! I would have called his mom on day 1 lol. Especially if he has a history of substance abuse and is being given opioids. That can\u2019t be easy. You did absolutely nothing wrong.

Nta", "NTA and your MIL sounds amazing!", "NTA: this is who he is.", "NTA. He is. \n\nAlso he\u2019s projecting. Couldn\u2019t be there for him in sickness my ass. Men leave their sick partners.

OP put her life on hold for her fianc\u00e9 and he's so wrapped up in his own problems that he can't take 2 seconds to thank her? He's had full time help and the moment she asks for help she's not good enough for him?

You need some me time and to recover.\n\nMyself and my wife have experienced this and when weaning off painkillers or in other sorts of pain we get extremely grumpy.

You mentioned prior drug abuse,  and now this medical situation is dredging up a lot of bad reactions and behaviors - behaviors you've had to deal with before. \n\nLove is not enough.
