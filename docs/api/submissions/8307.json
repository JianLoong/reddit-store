We are not having one of those THINGS in this family\u201d\n- left for days at a time, leaving me with no food, electricity or heating. \n- kicked me out at 14 after I snapped at her for drinking, she threw a stiletto at me which I still have a scar from. \n- she destroyed my sisters chance at studying abroad in America. \n- she is an all around narcissist and refuses to admit to anything or see fault with any of it. \n\nSo, it was my birthday a few days ago, as I\u2019m away for university, I didn\u2019t get to see my family but my boyfriend and I made plans to go out with a friend. \n\nMy mother had been trying to get into contact with me for the past few months through family members who still are in contact with her, asking for phone numbers, friend requests on Facebook etc. I had ignore all of the attempts as I have made it very clear to her over the years that I want nothing to do with her. \n\nSo on my bday, I get a phone call from an unrecognised number and answer it, thinking it was one of the plumbers I was waiting to get in touch about fixing a burst pipe, only to hear a lot of talking in the background, I knew it was a pub simply from the type of noise, followed by a very slurred \u201cHello?\u201d From my mother. \nBefore she could get another word in I hung up and blocked the number. \nI contacted my family asking who gave her my phone number but no one admitted to it, instead calling me immature and saying I should have at least accepted the birthday wishes. \nBut I refuse to interact with a woman who actively destroyed my life and the lives of those around me, showing no remorse at all. \n\nSo , should I have at least heard another word?

You don't owe your \"mother\" anything at all.", "From reading, it\u2019s obvious that you are no longer trying to create a relationship or talk to her. NTA for hanging up on her. I feel like at some point some people do not need help and your care and thoughts are better off elsewhere. I feel like at some point if you are really annoyed at your mother I would just tell her yourself about being NC from now on.", "NTA.\n\nLook, f- her. You give those people a tiny tiny fingertip into your life they're right back in it. There is no, 'just accept this small thing.' All of their gifts, and all of their 'kindness' come with a whole bunch of strings attached. She didn't even have the common courtesy to call you sober.\n\nDon't take any of it.", "NTA -- you owe your abuser NOTHING.\n\nIn the future, if you ever do decide to contact her, it should be entirely on YOUR terms. And if you think you're healthier without her in your life (which right now, it certainly sounds like), you are NOT obligated to contact her AT ALL.  \n\nAnyone who tells you otherwise either 1) isn't thinking of your best interests, or 2) simply doesn't understand the situation.  Keep on taking care of yourself -- and happy belated birthday!", "NTA\n\nStick with NC I'd say, of course it's your own decision but she doesn't sound like a good person to be around and if you heard her in a pub, slurring her words.. She clearly hasn't changed either. \n\nSome people don't change, it sucks to think about but its will be easier later on in life once you accept that they just won't change. I think your mother is one of those people. Regarding your family. F em.. They're the immature ones for thinking that your mother deserves a second chance, especially since she isn't doing anything for it.", "NTA. Stay away from her. Regardless of whether she's your mother, she's toxic. Tell all family that if they ever give her any of your contact info again you'll go NC on them as well. Perhaps it's time to tell family in excruciating detail some of the things she's done to you and sibs.", "NTA. Her feelings aren\u2019t your problem.

They made it clear it was about making her feel better for herself.", "NTA times a million!!\n\nI am so sorry that this was the person you were unlucky enough to have as your egg donor, but the title of mother is earned. She clearly never did, so you\u2019ve got nothing to feel bad about at all. Stay strong with your NC, and get rid of any \u201cfamily\u201d that is aware of those bullet points of your life and still choose to ignore your trauma.

She made her bed. She has a disease, but addiction isn't a free pass from the consequences of one's behavior.\n\nYou having a boundary to protect you from a person who has shown you nothing but toxic behavior is not immature at all, and your family is out of line.

Family members aren't owed your attention just because they are family. Your mum didn't look after you the way she should have, and her issues have had a lasting impact on you. If you ever want to talk to her again, limited contact or otherwise, that is your decision. But please, never feel guilty for closing the door on someone who treated you that way.
