Prior to our marriage, my current wife and I discussed the fact that she does not have any kids and would like to be a mother.  In order to achieve that, I had to undergo a vasovasectomy, which is a vasectomy reversal.  We successfully had a healthy boy and we adore him.  \n\nNow, my wife wants another.  We had talked about having one, but not more than that.  As it is, I pay $3,000/mo in alimony and child support to provide for my other children, and they are only over on the weekends.  So my finances are constrained.  I\u2019m also faced with the idea of raising teenagers in my later years.  I have said over and over that I do not want any more kids, but her point is that due to the toxic nature of my ex-wife, my other children don\u2019t have the best relationship with my current wife despite her efforts.  So she doesn\u2019t feel like the family is blended and she wants to have a legacy too.  It makes sense, but I still say that I don\u2019t want any more.  On the other hand, she gives so much to our family, and treats her step kids like they are her own, despite the division.  She\u2019s a wonderful person, and I love her very much, which makes it hard for me to say no. \n\nIt\u2019s come to a point where we realize that compromise is not even a possibility, because we are talking about a human life, and in order for a decision to be made, someone has to give in.  I\u2019d obviously love and care for any child I\u2019m responsible for, but I really don\u2019t want to go through it again.  \n\nAm I the asshole?", "created_utc": 1694782904, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16jcsvy/aita_for_telling_my_wife_that_i_dont_want_any/", "score": 15, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Good luck with what you decide.", "NTA and your wife (although she sounds kind) is kind of being the selfish one here. There are a million reasons to want children, but wanting it to fill the void of wanting a legacy/make up for the fact she isn't close with her step children when there is so much financial weight in it is not a great reason to have another child. That and you already agreed to one- no further discussion.\n\nKids are a lot more fun when adding one doesn't put you in a bad spot financially. Let's say that the next kid has health needs that the others don't? It's already a big risk if everything goes well, even bigger and financially ruining if it's not.\n\nStay firm! This is a tough spot to be in and hopefully she can love you and see you as her partner more than a sperm donor (I say this because if it was the other way around, many women get up in arms about being seen as incubators when they don't want to be mothers).", "A compromise is possible and you already did it. You didn't want more kids. She wanted to be a mother. You compromised in having one kid. She shouldn't expect to have more kids just because her relationship with your kids isn't what she hoped for.\n\nShe knew she was marrying someone who already had 4 kids.\n\nNTA\n\nYou shouldn't have more kids just because of how much she wants them or how nice she treats your other kids. You should (or not) have kids because you want to.", "I hate all the selfish reasons people have kids. You only see your other 4 kids a few weekends a month and you brought another kid into the world so your new wife could be a mother. What happens if you and your current wife can\u2019t make it work? You\u2019re a weekend dad to\u2026 how many kids? I wish people would think about the lives they\u2019re considering bringing into the world and not just about themselves. Do you really think a kid wants to be brought into this world to help heal your wife\u2019s issues? No. That\u2019s a lot to put on a kid. \n\nIf you don\u2019t want another kid, don\u2019t have another fucking kid!!!!!!!!! Why is this so hard for parents to do? You literally don\u2019t have to keep bringing kids into this world, stop trying to talk yourself into it ffs. \n\nI\u2019m going with YTA because why tf are you afraid to just say no? A kid is not a new rug or tv, it\u2019s a whole life that you clearly don\u2019t want. Just stop trying to make excuses and tell her no.", "NAH.  I think she might resent the fact that you were willing to have multiple children with your toxic ex but don\u2019t want to have more than one with her. I get that financially it will be tough, but your other children won\u2019t be getting child support forever. Really think about which choice will have the worst impact on your relationship and your family. Will your wife be able to be happy if you don\u2019t have another child?

We can however point out things you might have overlooked in your thought process.\n\nIt's not just about having another child with your wife, and being in your sixties when your child is in college, but also giving your youngest child a sibling, because it seems they're going to be like an only child..\n\nAlso, how old are your oldest children?\n\nWhen will you stop paying child support? \n\nWill the child support become less when you have another child to provide for?\n\nDoes your wife have a good income?\n\nNAH", "NTA if she wanted kids she should've married someone who wanted kids. It's one of the non-negotiable things you discuss before marriage.", "NAH. I would consider taking this to marriage counseling, though, to work through it proactively so that whatever you two decide doesn't become a source of major tension and resentment. Neither of you is wrong. From your POV, you're in your mid-forties and have five kids and don't want any more. That's perfectly understandable. From her POV, she has four stepchildren who keep her at arm's length, and only one child she can truly bond with and be a mother to. It's perfectly understandable that, now that she's experienced the joy of having a child of her own, she wants one more. Sorry OP, there's no easy way out of this - good luck to both of you.", "Nta. Whether she realized it or not she made the choice to marry someone who obviously (vasectomy) didn\u2019t want more kids despite her wanting kids. That was her first mistake. She should\u2019ve left and found someone who wanted kids like her. Now she thinks because she talked you into one you should want more. Or even more messed up, that since you gave your ex more why wouldn\u2019t you give her more if you love her? Stand firm. She is being manipulative. All of this is her own fault.", "NTA you don't want anymore kids, and she does. This is where she is going to have to accept or leave. You can't compromise on a child. You guys had the discussion of having one child and that was it. You have the one child now, so that's it plain and simple. She feels the family isn't blended, so how is her logic that having more kids it will somehow fix that? If anything, the other kids might not have a good relationship with their half sibling, which could make things even more complicated.", "NTA\n\nYour wife is being selfish. She wants more children because her step kids don't like her and she wants a legacy. Your son is her legacy. And having more children isn't going to help blend the family. \n\nKids aren't bandages to heal the parent's ego. Don't have more if you truly don't want another child.", "NAH.", "NAH- no one is wrong here. I wish you both success and contentment in your decisions", "NTA - it\u2019s irresponsible to have children you can\u2019t afford and that is a very valid reason not to want to have more. You already have 5 children. I understand your wife wants more biological kids but if it\u2019s not feasible, it\u2019s not feasible. You need to go to couples counseling and get professional help to move forward.", "More info needed, have you tried talking about this with her? Is this an argument between you and her or you and yourself? I'm leaning towards NAH but I want to know if you have discussed this.", "NTA be careful though, make sure you dispose of your completed condoms.", "NTA.\n\nYou don't want anymore kids and i don't blame you for sticking too it, you have one child with your current wife and that should be enough.\n\nI will warn you though, make sure you're prepared for what may come, she may decide she is having another with or without you.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

As far as her relationship with your current children, all she can do is continue to be wonderful to them. How they respond is their own choice as individual human beings. I will also add, as a child of divorce, I did have resentment towards my step-mom as a teenager and acted out, but today she is one of my favorite people in the world because of how genuine and kind and wonderful she is. When you're younger you don't recognize or have the perspective of some things until you get more life experience.
