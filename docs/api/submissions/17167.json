The airline offered a discount for the next flight that had to be redeemed within a year or the offer expired. \n\nI will have to double check at work but I have seen a fair number of gift cards that *do* have expiration dates but they are usually 5 years to a decade away,", "FYI- that\u2019s not universally true. In my state in the USA that is the case, but not in every state. And I have no idea what the laws are in other countries", "Edit response because I wasn't sure and wanted to check.\nGift Cards *can* expire but not for at least 5 years.", "First class purchased the same day from a third tier airport\u2026.MAAAYBE \ud83d\ude02", "If he grabbed first class seats it could do that high but he would need to be looking for a flight with pretty much no availability", "She can afford not to notice and when my husband said something she made some nasty comments about how if I'd just made him this specialty dessert earlier I'd have seen it so I didn't deserve it. So it was not replaced which I didn't expect anyway.", "No...I said he should have given A GIFT. Like a check for $200 or a Crock Pot. Something that didn't require any form of coordination after the fact.\n\n\nBut....if you haven't noticed, the last three years have been a pandemic. Travel hasn't been the greatest idea. \n\n\nAnd he still works for the airline...just has gotten promoted. \n\n\nWhat's the cutoff? If he tried to use the gift 2 months later? 6 months? A year? It's likely that they already had honeymoon plans and maybe no more PTO for that year.", "That\u2019s not the same thing as a gift certificate.", "Also I think I read once that after 5 years they still can't *Really* expire, they just then are worth the face value paid. \n\nExample: I pay $50 for a $75 gift certificate (or whatever) to Six Flags. After 5 years, it's still valid but it's now only worth the original $50 paid, not the full $75. \n\nSo, technically, you were right & they don't really expire and become useless.", "It\u2019s like you\u2019re being willfully obtuse so I\u2019m done \ud83d\ude02", "It does fully depend on the ToC of said offer. I had an offer for a discounted flight expiring after a year. Some states might differ but a national restriction is a gift card keeping it's value for at least 5 years or 1 year after money is added to it (likely the reloadable ones)"]}
