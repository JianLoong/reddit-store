If they pay for it, then I\u2019m fine hanging with the kids and enjoying Disney at the level they can while also helping wrangling them. That is a good exchange: I get a free trip, they get help with the kiddos. But even tho I love my nieces and nephews, there\u2019s no way I\u2019d pay for a Disney trip only to be a babysitter.
