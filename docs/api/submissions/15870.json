So she's hoping that it will magically change if she puts in the time and shows him her worth with the cleaning, etc.  It won't.", "I am sorry if this is something that you are personally dealing with because it sucks. But you absolutely can be in a loving relationship and have low self esteem. I don't need to google it because I know from experience. If you wallow in it and don't work on yourself then yeah, nothing is going to get better. I have low self esteem. I also know that a lot of things I struggle with are not things that others see in me. I fight against that voice telling me I'm worthless every day. I've also been with the same person for close to a decade. We are happy together and communication is a huge part of that. And I absolutely know that I am not alone in this because I talk to others about their struggles too.", "Nowhere in her post did she say she wanted to be his gf or anything along those lines. She said they\u2019d been doing their situationship for a year. She is a willing participant who clearly stated she knows what type of relationship she\u2019s in. Why do you want her to be his gf so bad? Because she cooks for him and cleans the apartment she stays at 3 nights a week? I don\u2019t get it.", "Sorry, but I don\u2019t trust what you\u2019re saying. You\u2019re probably deluding yourself. Look at the OP. More than likely, your relationship is not what you think it is.\nLike I said, you should Google the subject. Psychologist and therapists agree with me; they don\u2019t agree with you.", "Kinda AH. He asked you to not do something where no one was at risk of losing life or limb by you not doing it. Whatever his reason or motivation,  it was not an unreasonable request.\n\nNOR was you desire (obsession?) to find it.", "So someone else sleeps in that bed the other nights and cooks and cleans when they stay.  NTA but you're just a 3 night a week stand, nothing else.", "YTA He said don't look.  You did, you thought you knew better than him.  Well, congratulations, you were right.  But you betrayed his wishes. You overstepped boundries.  Hope it was worth it.", "YTA - He asked you specifically not to do something and you did it. \n\nWhy do you seem to think you are allowed to ignore his boundaries?", "NTA.  There is something weird here.  He either is hiding something in the bedroom or he didn\u2019t want the wallet to be found.  Maybe both.\n\nHe is likely seeing other women and maybe there was something in the room that would reveal it.  He may have decided he could get some cash by selling an expensive wallet and pretending it was lost.  Pretty stupid either way.\n\nThe fact that he is now making it about you shows you that he wants the spot light off of his behavior.  \u201cDon\u2019t look at what I did, look at what you did.\u201d  Definitely something fishy going on.", "Soft YTA for breaching his privacy. Big YTA to yourself.. honestly OP\nAt this point you are an adult and if you continue to stay with this guy despite how much he is treating you like shit that\u2019s on you so you get 0 sympathy for me. \nIt\u2019s clear you realize how shitty your situation so really it\u2019s pointless to beg you to do this or that \nYou know what is best for you", " *But I\u2019m really confused - am I the asshole here?*\n\nYes.\n\nYou are trying to turn a FWB into a real relationship. If you are not dating, you do not have to cook or clean for him (you don't have to do that stuff when you are dating either). You don't give gifts. Even though you are in his bed three nights a week, he told you not to go in there at that time. You went anyway and he is mad.\n\nThe lines of this 'relationship' aren't blurry for him at least. You can either ask him to define it more clearly or you can accept that you are a 'bang maid'. What you do with that revelation is up to you.", "NTA for the finding the wallet thats awesome of you! but you are being awful to yourself and I need to ask a question here my friend.... why would he ever make it more than the situation-ship or FWB if you are giving him everything he could want in a GF without the commitment? he has zero reason to want to take the relationship to the next level because you already have but he does not need to do any work to maintain that. BE BETTER TO YOURSELF! Stop being a girlfriend for a guy who doesn't care and takes advantage of you, i do not mean to sound harsh but he does not like you or value you he thinks your stupid. I said this to my friend who has been dating this guy forever she cant figure out why he wont marry her.... news flash girly  why would he marry you when you already act like a wife.... stop giving yourself to people who done deserve you... If he does not match your effort, match his watch how quickly he shows his true colors... and on the off chance he actually cares for you in a romantic way you will see him JUMP and I mean JUMP through hoops for you... if he does not start JUMPING you BOUNCE!", "What on earth led you to that conclusion. Why is it so hard for him to just have misplaced the wallet???\n\nIf he had some evil plan around the wallet it wouldn't just be in the bed sheets.", "Why? If someone tells you not to go into a room of their house and you do so.... You're an asshole. It literally doesn't matter why they said no.", "My guess is that she saw him glancing around in that way people do, and he admitted that he was looking for his wallet--one moment before he realized where it probably was.  Doesn't even have to be a set-up.  He just didn't think fast enough to lie about what he was looking for.", "> (relative- a $40 wallet is expensive to me. Why else you got pockets)\n\nFor me an expensive wallet is *multiple* layers of duck tape beyond 2 pieces stuck to each other\n\nI've seen wallets with change pouches but I just use an old pill bottle in my pocket for that", "You bring your sex buddy to your parents? Why?", "Are you Annie from Bridesmaids? Cuz this guy sounds like Ted.", "The insane part is that she's cleaning his house and cooking for him. Girl, just stop.", "He doesn\u2019t want to date or be exclusive.", "I am not so sure there. He made it more than clear that he doesn't want a relationship. He is telling her all the time that they are not serious. A booty call really can't expect the same rights and considerations as a GF in my opinion. \n\nWhat I don't understand is why OP is not leaving? She sounds like she wants more, does all this extra stuff for him like cooking and cleaning and buying him expensive gifts. She even brought him to her parents for some weird reason. And this all while he made it clear that he is not interested in having her as his GF at all. \n\nOP should start to accept reality and stop hoping for more. There won't be more. Not after 1.5 years of the guy not changing his mind.", "I once saw it suggested to hide your wallet in your bed to make it harder to steal while you're sleeping. Maybe he forgot it once getting up. This would also fit with the hypothesis that he was cheating, as a one night stand might have the opportunity for such a theft.", "Situationships are what happens when FWB goes wrong.  One person wants there to be a different relationship than FWB or one person starts acting like it's a different relationship than FWB - and then there's a clash of expectations and roles and feelings and a lot of those go unstated et voila - situationship.  It's a thing, no one quite knows what it is, and if anyone looks really closely someone's probably going to be even more hurt than they already might be.", "No, I think he is", "Do you want more? Because if yes, it sounds like you should break up your situationship and look for someone else.", "He's using you & you're letting him. You're just his bangmaid.", "But do you want to date him? And if so, how did he convince you this arrangement was a good idea?", "How common is it really for a women to accidentally leave her underwear at a guy's house outside of a movie? Like I guess if it was seriously seriously lost it could happen, but I feel like that's in the top 3 things you're unlikely to neglect to take when you go?", "Lying by omission requires you to be asked questions and you to withhold information that you know is what they are after. Not simply not explaining yourself to someone.\n\nHe didn't lie. He's not an asshole. Op knows what she's in and could leave anytime.", "or or or or... \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "Also realistic scenarios!", "I had a long term fwb as well. We did stuff together, as we had a friendship and cared about each other as friends, and we had a physical attraction, but there were no romantic \"in love\" or crushy feelings. Eventually stopped when the actual girlfriend (she knew about and was fine with everything) moved in. Wasn't logistically convenient anymore plus he had less free time. Still friends though."]}
