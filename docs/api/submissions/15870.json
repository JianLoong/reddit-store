I can tell by the comments that you\u2019re a kind person, but he\u2019s taking advantage of that kindness.

Find another man because you're hoping for more than you're going to get here.", "ESH you aren\u2019t respecting yourself in this \u201csituationship.\u201d I looked at your other comments and you\u2019re in groups about cheating and infidelity so it\u2019s pretty clear you see your relationship as exclusive and believe he is cheating on you. He isn\u2019t cheating, that\u2019s not your deal. He\u2019s the asshole as he sounds like a manipulative guy who is using your much stronger feelings for him to get benefits I.e. sex, cooking. It also sounds to me like he either invented a senario for you to cross a boundary he set so you two could get into a fight and end things. \n\nI know it can be hard to cut something off and I\u2019m guessing you\u2019ve been hoping for a year and a half he would commit to you.

He definitely knew where his wallet was and I'm guessing pretended to lose it because if his other women saw a new wallet they  would question it.\n\nEven though it had a good result, you SHOULD respect someone's privacy if they ask. I get that you sleep there but that's not the point. When my partner sets a hard boundary even if I think it's stupid or not for a good reason, I still have to respect it if I respect them.", "YTA\n\nNot for figuring out where the wallet was, but to yourself. This situation shop has too many red flags. You cook & clean for him, but you\u2019re not his girlfriend? Sounds like he\u2019s using you.", "NTA. \nBut also, babes why are you cleaning his place in a situation-shop. Especially when it sounds like he\u2019s trying to hide the fact that he\u2019s seeing other people.", "NTA, but definitely naive. Why would you be cleaning the house of your situationship? Hell no.", "Nope. NTA. Time to end this situationship. Move on to someone better", "NTA. However, you sleep with him at least three times a week, cook and clean for him, buy him expensive gifts, but you\u2019re not \u201cdating.\u201d It sounds like there are more important issues that you need to discuss with him. It sounds like you\u2019re a part-time live-in cook and maid who also provides sexual services. This \u201csituationship\u201d seems to be a bit imbalanced.", "NTA. But why are you contributing your labour for this man. Have sex with him if it suits you, but please don't clean his house. Your situation is not exclusive. If he wanted to change that he would have already.", "It sounds like you are more invested then him in this situationship, cooking,  cleaning and expensive gifts?\nHe hid the gift either in hope of you giving him another expensive gift or he didn't like it. \nI am pretty sure he knows you are more emotional involved and uses it to his advantage but it's up to you how much you put into this and set boundaries. \nStop paying for stuff and be his cook and maid. I am sure his true colours will show.", "\u201cI don\u2019t know why men walk all over me?\u201d - woman who lets men walk all over her. \n\nYou broke the first rule of a successful \u201csituationship\u201d, you cared enough to find his wallet.", "I think this is the most practical answer on this thread.", "OP said they\u2019re not dating\u2026after a year and a half.", "Tbf Its quite possible he didn\u2019t know it\u2019s there, happened to me before \ud83d\ude05 turned the whole house around to find it for some reason under the covers.", "If you read OP's comment history on other subs, you will see that the situation is not working out for her.

Did you find out he\u2019s definitely doing this with others too?", "This makes you vulnerable to controlling men. Even apart from the obvious lack of commitment and exclusivity from him, he knows you would do anything for him and is taking advantage of that. You weren't wrong to check a bed you sleep in and clean on a regular basis after he said he looked.\n\nYou're treating this as a relationship.

Those puzzle pieces are in the wrong places to me", "Honestly it sounds like you treat him as your boyfriend but he only wants you for sex. It would be fine if you both wanted just sex or if you both wanted a relationship, but in this case it just seems like you are settling for less because you really like him and that's the only type of relationship you can have with him. Do yourself a favour and just move on, this dude doesn't like you nearly as much as you like him.", "According to you, you guys are friends. If your not dating and more then acquaintances then you are just friends. Is there a reason you don\u2019t want to date this man?", "Oh girl. Youre NTA but seriously? You arent in a relationship with him so hes not wrong. He doesnt have to make you comfortable you arent his girlfriend. Why are you cleaning his place? And buying him gifts? Hes not your boyfriend. Do better for yourself youre worth more than this.", "You\u2019re not dating.

He is having all the cake and eating it. Sleeps with you, you cook and clean for him, but aren't even allowed in the bedroom when he says so, and aren't exclusive after a year and a half??? Does he have a Rocco Siffredi length... or something?? If so, I understand. Otherwise, don't waste the best years of your life on this guy.", "NTA he is clearly hiding something, and you clearly need to stop whatever this nonsense is and move on.", "Stop wasting your time with this guy.

You deserve better.", "NTA. \n\nMy guess is he pretended to lose the wallet bc he didn't want to explain to his wife/girlfriend where the new wallet came from, and didn't want to explain to OP that she's the sidechick and lose his part time maid /fuckbuddy", ">he told me not to look into the bedroom as he had already looked there before.\n\nHow did you interpret that as a suggestion?\n\nAnyway if you sleep there frequently I think NTA because you're clearly \"allowed\" to go in there. He's pissed his wishes were disregarded (and probably embarrassed you found it so easily).", "NTA.  He is using you.  You aren't his gf.  You will never be his gf.  Harsh truth.  It doesn't matter how much you try to please him, do nice things for, clean and cook for him, buy him expensive things.  He is enjoying taking all of this from you. Do yourself a favour and end it.", "YTA.\n\nHe said don't look in there. You did. Simple as that.", "NTA. You sleep there three nights a week. You bought him an expensive wallet. You cook and clean.

If you are cooking and cleaning and blowing him and y\u2019all still aren\u2019t in a relationship, he\u2019s taking advantage of you big time. \n\nAs an example, my ex\u2019s car broke down and he needed me to drive him everywhere for a couple weeks. He lived with a family from our church at the time that I knew. One morning I went to pick him up for an event we were both running and he wasn\u2019t responding to my texts saying I was waiting for him. So I went to the front door and knocked. His host opened the door and I asked for him and while I was waiting we chatted. When he finally got in the car, he was seething that I had the audacity to do such an awful thing\u2026.of trying to get him out the door on time. Literally the guy was embarrassed to be associated with me. \n\nI believe in respecting boundaries but making up a fake boundary and then getting pissed when it gets \u201cviolated\u201d is a huge \ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9 There\u2019s definitely something else going on here.

Move on he ain\u2019t worth it.", "NTA but I say this with love.. quit cooking and cleaning for a man that isn't exclusive to you! He's getting the benefits without the commitment. He clearly didn't want you to find out about the next girl.", "ESH, you shouldn't go into rooms you've been asked not to go into, he's using you and shouldn't accept expensive gifts or your domestic services if he doesn't want a relationship.", "NTA. \n\nOn the bed under the covers feels like a test. Did he put it there on purpose and tell you not to look just to see if you listen?", "From the OP's comment history 16 days ago on a post about getting over jealousy:\n\n*I have felt this way too. And sometimes I compare myself to women who I feel like I am better off which makes it more infuriating (by better off means I wouldn\u2019t have been jealous of them if it weren\u2019t for my man paying attention to them. I think they are okay but don\u2019t inspire me in any way). The bitterness and hate harbored within me just causes so much frustration and comes out in ways which make me uglier than I am as a person. I wish I knew the solution but you aren\u2019t alone. We will figure this out sooner or later! It\u2019s hard to deal with this baggage and some people aren\u2019t as secure as everyone else and that\u2019s okay. Hmu if you want just a sounding bag or a non judgmental space to vent out the jealousy.*\n\nOh, girl. What are you doing. If this is how you're feeling, this is not just a \"situationship\" for you. Are you just tolerating this because you hope he will make you his girlfriend and you're just waiting him out? Because he is ***not going to do that***. And you are just going to get more hurt and unhappy, and he is going to walk away the second this becomes ***any*** trouble at all. He is treating you as a bangmaid, and that won't change. You need to break this off and look for someone who actually wants the same kind of relationship you do. I am a big fan of nontraditional relationships and casual sex, but these ONLY work if both people genuinely want the same thing. These one-sided romantic feelings is a recipe for misery.
