Yesterday I came home from school and got ready for work, I drive because my job is pretty far and takes hours by bus. My mom refused to give me her keys because... she wanted to drive her friend to the airport that night. I said she can ask dad to drive her friend after he comes home from work, she refused and started yelling at me. I resorted to taking the bus and got written up for being an hour late... I barely get to drive, maybe 2-3 times/week while she drives everywhere. I guess she loves showing off her driving skills and new car because even when her friends drove to our houe and offered to drive to the park or restarant, she always refuses and insist she drives. Even if I asked to use the car a day before... So when it came to paying the bills this month, I didn't send her anything.

Don't pay insurance either.   Her policy requires her to insure you if you live in her house.  If she decides to kick you out,  make her evict you through the court system.

You need to come up with some kind of schedule so there is no arguing over it. You need it for work so it's simply your car for work, if she needs to give someone a lift and it's during those hours, tough, conversely she can have times the car is hers. Then you have times the car is open to whoever uses it, but with a priority to whoever has the much more obviously important plans.

I'm looking for a new car right now (well, new to me-- a newish used car) and 20k is closer to the TOTAL cost I'm looking for, and what I'm finding for that price cannot be described as a \"beater\" at all. I'm talking cars with backup cameras, blind spot sensors, Apple Carplay/Android Auto, cruise control, and included warranties; and no damage, only one or two previous owners, and less than 50k miles. The two of you could have had a completely paid-off, perfectly serviceable car for that much. \n\nYour mom just used you to be able to get a really fancy car. She should not have taken advantage of you like that. She's your mother, and you should be able to trust her, but she roped you into a REALLY bad deal and I'm so sorry she's such an asshole.\n\nINFO: is your name on the title of the car? And whose name is the loan in? If your name is on the loan, you might have problems if you just stop making payments on it, because if your asshole mom refuses to make the payments, your credit score could be impacted-- and that could be financially devastating to you. Of course, the car might get repossessed, which would be very embarrassing to her, so she might make the payments to prevent that-- but you'd essentially be paying chicken with your financial future. So if your name is on the loan, you might need to go to court to get disentangled from this situation instead.", "Could you talk to your dad about the issue?", "Could always sue her for it.", "Small claims court", "I am in the same area of thinking as you, how can a mother do that to her child.

Maybe you can find a place on the side of town that you work, so the bus is not so long.   \n\nI don't know the solution here, but your mom is TA"]}
