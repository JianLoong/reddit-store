My mom 45F and half-siblings 16F and 12F used to live with my sister 23F who can\u2019t always keep a job because she parties and drinks so much she is often late or absent. Side note: I have not seen any of my family members except for my 12 sister on a consistent basis since I moved out at 19. Well recently my sister got drunk and fought with my mom and so she kicked my siblings and my mom out of her apartment. My mom has asked if my sisters can stay with me while she gets help because she was in an abusive relationship with my half-sisters\u2019 father and it left her pretty messed up. I agreed after having a talk with my boyfriend and so we set up our old game room for my sisters. We bought a brand new bunk bed, 2 desks, hangers, new bedding, bathroom supplies, school supplies and etc to try and help my sisters adjust to living with us especially since we live further away so they would have to switch schools. My 12 year old sister has stayed with us before, her and my boyfriend get a long great he takes her to go so horror movies she wants to see because I can\u2019t watch them and she calls hermano mayor because she wants to learn Spanish and he is teaching her well she has been adjusting pretty well she follows the rules, cleans up after her self, goes to school, and does her homework. My 16 year old sister in the other hand is pretty much the opposite and it stresses me out, I recently found out she hasn\u2019t been going to school and the 2 times she did bother to show up she missed half the day, she hasn\u2019t done her homework in years apparently in fact she is currently repeating the same grade for the 3rd time, I also recently found out she has been smoking with her \u201cfriends\u201d and she always fights with my 12 year old sister and when I try to talk to her she mocks me or walks away and always has an attitude. My boyfriend is very upset and wants her gone mostly because I have a past trauma connected with the smell of weed and when we both came home after working a 15 hour shift which we both have to do on occasion the smell of it was so strong I had a panic attack and burst into tears. \n\nSide notes: me and my boyfriend both leave for work around 5:30/6:00am so we aren\u2019t able to make sure she gets on the bus at 7:15am and yes she does know how I feel about weed but has told me she doesn\u2019t care and will do with her life as she pleases.\n\nSo AITA for wanting to tell my mom to find her somewhere else to live?\n\nSome more context: My mom is currently in a \u201cmental institution\u201d of sorts to get help because my half-sisters\u2019 father abused her so bad that when my sister got drunk and hit her she had an episode is now considered a threat to her self and is not capable of raising my sisters. My biggest concern is for my 12 year old sister just by watching them I have seen how her body language changes and becomes instinctively more guarded/defensive when the 16 year old is near. I think at this point my only reasoning for not wanting to push her out is because I don\u2019t want her to feel like I am abandoning her the way everyone else seems to have done to her.", "created_utc": 1702070447, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18dx0p6/aita_because_i_dont_want_my_16_year_old_sister_to/", "score": 35, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The 16 yo and the 12 yo needn't be a package deal. It will only be good for them to split up. Your mother is ultimately responsible for both of them, so she should be happy that she currently only needs to find a solution for the oldest girl. That, on the other hand, she needs to take on urgently, for everyone's sake. It sounds as if the 16 yo is about ready for some kind of boot camp.
