If your girlfriend had phrased it as 'I feel like I'll miss you if you're playing for four days straight, could we maybe hang out for a couple of hours on the Sunday?' and you refused, it'd be different. But it couldn't be clearer that she's just dead set against the whole thing. If you leave the door open for plans at this point she'll probably try and take half the time you have scheduled.\n\nIt's shitty of her to try and dictate how you use your leave allocation, for one thing. My partner booked herself a ten day trip to another country to see family, and it was my choice whether or not I tagged along. She didn't discuss it or ask first, just did it, and that's fair enough. It's her holiday to use as she chooses.\n\nIf your girlfriend was that bothered about not seeing you all weekend or having unequal amounts of leave she could take the same days off and spend the time with you taking an interest in your hobby. If that's her idea of Hell, she needs to accept that she won't be seeing much of you that weekend.\n\nI wonder, does she make this much of a fuss if you plan to go away for a weekend with friends or family?

Your main priority should always be YOU. There's nothing wrong with taking some me time for a hobbie and if your girlfriend can't have a weekend without being glued to you, that's more of a red flag in my eyes than you taking a long weekend to have some fun alone.", "If you live with your partner, why not take an hour break or something every day? You're not playing the entire four days straight right?", "This is going to be only of those tricky balancing acts in any relationship. It sounds like she's in a place where she thinks she has a right to judge the worthiness of your hobbies and to weigh them in the balance against what she wants you to do with her.\n\nThat would never fly in my relationship with my wife, but I've seen plenty of seemingly healthy relationships where it is part of the unspoken contract between the two people involved.\n\nI'm going to go NAH.", "This is more a relationship post than a AITA one but I would be seriously pissed off if my bf didn't want to see me on a weekend because he wanted to play video game for 4 days straight. \n\nIf you do actually have enough leave left that it doesn't impact your ability to go on holidays and stuff then I'm going to go NTA, you do deserve time for your hobbies, but I can see why she is annoyed", "NTA but you\u2019re gonna be a single NTA if you keep that shit up.", "I've done stuff like this. Like taken Tuesday-Friday off for a Destiny 2 DLC release. More than once, actually.\n\nThat being said, I was single and even then, I didn't shut everything else down. I devoted a lot of time to the game but I didn't eschew every other aspect of life. I went out with friends and if I had a girlfriend I would definitely have taken breaks to spend time with her and if she wanted to go do something I would do that too? The game will still be there after that weekend. Your girlfriend might not be. \n\nYour girlfriend should, ideally, respect your hobbies, if not display some measure of interest. It's not entirely clear she doesn't, but it's not unreasonable of her to want to spend time with you over the course of a 4-day weekend and you should accommodate that. If you have 96 hours and spend 32 of them sleeping and another 40 of them playing (10 hours a day), that leaves 24 hours to spend doing other stuff. With your girlfriend. \n\nYTA if you're intending to block out 96 hours for absolutely nothing but whatever game it is (honestly kinda a red flag you're not saying which game tbh) and sleeping. Your girlfriend is kinda TA if she is thinking all of your PTO belongs to her and you can't use any of it for yourself. \n\nINFO: I guess it also depends on how much time off you have. Is this two days out of a total of 5? Or 25?", "ESH.\n\nIt's your vacation time do with as you please.

Hard playing a game for over 96 hours is unreasonable and not good for your health and I have a feeling that isn't the plan.

I'm taking the time off to relax and recharge by enjoying a hobby, how isn't that healthy?", "Four consecutive days to play a brand new game that he has been waiting for years to come out it perfectly fine. If this was like a pattern of him disappearing each weekend, yeah that would be a problem. But doing it once when the game comes out? Nah. that\u2019s fine.", "Ah, well I don\u2019t think you\u2019d be an asshole to take those days off to play your vidya.\n\nBut you\u2019re not dating Reddit, so I hope you can work something out with them. Assuming you won\u2019t be forgoing food during the long weekend, making a simple dinner plan could go a long way in placating your partner.", "Hell yeah, do your thing! Enjoy your vacation", "That sounds reasonable to me. NTA.", "I think he meant the other way around. As in such behaviour would never work in his relationship with his wife. Imight be wrong tho.", "Sorry I shouldn't have assumed, that does make it better but I do hope you can spare a few hours to do something nice with her", "Soo, going to dinner would be fine but going for a hike or running a bunch of errands isn't? That's reasonable. Speaking of which, are you expecting your girlfriend to clean up after you, or are you going to keep your end of the household up/take care of it beforehand? \n\nIt's context. Context generally matters. If you want to spend 4 days straight playing the Metal Gear Solid Collection, that's kinda ridiculous, given the games have been out for 15+ years. \n\nThe only argument the girlfriend had for the amount of time you were taking is if it was a considerable portion of your allotted time off and this definitely isn't. You still have 3 weeks left. NTA\n\nI will say your girlfriend probably feels bad that you want to spend a lot of time doing something that excludes her. Maybe extend it a day before and spend the whole day with her if she's amenable to that? \n\nOne of my clanmates sent his wife to a spa for a few days when Destiny 2: Forsaken released.", "Exactly this. Also the fact they are are a fully grown adult and if they wanna play a video for four days straight (taking from their own time and given advanced notice of said event) I really can\u2019t see why anyone would have the audacity to tell them otherwise! \ud83e\udd23 NTA OP. If OP said he wanted to take four days off to go on holiday no one would blink twice.", "You're agreeing with me. I stated I have no problem with taking 2 days off work to play a video game.", "How has the health of your relationship been since your decision?", "Nah F all that, it's 1 weekend, some partners act like they own you and your time \ud83d\ude02. If he wants to hermit and be all about himself and doesn't want to see her or any other human for an entire weekend it should be fine. Should not have to placate her, especially with this type of notice up front. There's no kids or major responsibility he's leaving her. Sounds like she's got attachment issues tbh.", "No I'm not expecting her to clean up after me, I'll still be doing my household chores over the weekend. \n\nWith the point about the game mattering I disagree because even with the example you gave, I haven't played any metal geal solid apart from 5 so for me and a lot of other people they would still be new games.", "Being in a relationship is not about doing whatever you want whenever you want with no regard for your partner. He has 96 hours to play this game and he's telling his girlfriend he's spending 0 of those hours with her.", "Well you and I aren't in a relationship with OP and thus do not have a full picture of what\u2019s going on.", "But they exist now. You could just play them now and not nolife them if you wanted to. The argument is that there are a lot of games coming out before the end of the year it would be a little ridiculous to want to play nonstop for 4 days. That's all. I'm not trying to impugn your choice of games.", "Well based on what he has said, there's absolutely no reason he's not allowed to be selfish and completely about himself for one long weekend, especially with plenty of notice. Wouldn't bother me if my partner did that and I would be annoyed if my partner tried to 'break mine up'. It's not like it's every weekend or a regular thing, your partner doesn't have to placate you and have dinner with you when they go on holiday with their friends and vice versa. We're all entitled to uninterrupted scheduled time with ourselves (in as long as you're not leaving kids or something like that for the other person to deal with).\n\n\nSounds like a suffocating level of attachment from her", "Oh yeah I get they exist now but if everyone thought like that then the collection wouldn't be in demand. I guess it's a good starting point for poeple who want them all together. I personally don't plan on getting them since there's enough coming out this year that I want already"]}
