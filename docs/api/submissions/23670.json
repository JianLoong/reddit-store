If your girlfriend had phrased it as 'I feel like I'll miss you if you're playing for four days straight, could we maybe hang out for a couple of hours on the Sunday?' and you refused, it'd be different. But it couldn't be clearer that she's just dead set against the whole thing. If you leave the door open for plans at this point she'll probably try and take half the time you have scheduled.\n\nIt's shitty of her to try and dictate how you use your leave allocation, for one thing. My partner booked herself a ten day trip to another country to see family, and it was my choice whether or not I tagged along. She didn't discuss it or ask first, just did it, and that's fair enough. It's her holiday to use as she chooses.\n\nIf your girlfriend was that bothered about not seeing you all weekend or having unequal amounts of leave she could take the same days off and spend the time with you taking an interest in your hobby. If that's her idea of Hell, she needs to accept that she won't be seeing much of you that weekend.\n\nI wonder, does she make this much of a fuss if you plan to go away for a weekend with friends or family?

Your main priority should always be YOU.

You're not playing the entire four days straight right?", "This is going to be only of those tricky balancing acts in any relationship. It sounds like she's in a place where she thinks she has a right to judge the worthiness of your hobbies and to weigh them in the balance against what she wants you to do with her.\n\nThat would never fly in my relationship with my wife, but I've seen plenty of seemingly healthy relationships where it is part of the unspoken contract between the two people involved.\n\nI'm going to go NAH.", "This is more a relationship post than a AITA one but I would be seriously pissed off if my bf didn't want to see me on a weekend because he wanted to play video game for 4 days straight. \n\nIf you do actually have enough leave left that it doesn't impact your ability to go on holidays and stuff then I'm going to go NTA, you do deserve time for your hobbies, but I can see why she is annoyed", "NTA but you\u2019re gonna be a single NTA if you keep that shit up.", "I've done stuff like this. Like taken Tuesday-Friday off for a Destiny 2 DLC release. More than once, actually.\n\nThat being said, I was single and even then, I didn't shut everything else down. I devoted a lot of time to the game but I didn't eschew every other aspect of life. I went out with friends and if I had a girlfriend I would definitely have taken breaks to spend time with her and if she wanted to go do something I would do that too? The game will still be there after that weekend. Your girlfriend might not be. \n\nYour girlfriend should, ideally, respect your hobbies, if not display some measure of interest. It's not entirely clear she doesn't, but it's not unreasonable of her to want to spend time with you over the course of a 4-day weekend and you should accommodate that. If you have 96 hours and spend 32 of them sleeping and another 40 of them playing (10 hours a day), that leaves 24 hours to spend doing other stuff. With your girlfriend. \n\nYTA if you're intending to block out 96 hours for absolutely nothing but whatever game it is (honestly kinda a red flag you're not saying which game tbh) and sleeping. Your girlfriend is kinda TA if she is thinking all of your PTO belongs to her and you can't use any of it for yourself. \n\nINFO: I guess it also depends on how much time off you have. Is this two days out of a total of 5? Or 25?", "ESH.\n\nIt's your vacation time do with as you please.

Hard playing a game for over 96 hours is unreasonable and not good for your health and I have a feeling that isn't the plan.

Nah. that\u2019s fine.", "Ah, well I don\u2019t think you\u2019d be an asshole to take those days off to play your vidya.\n\nBut you\u2019re not dating Reddit, so I hope you can work something out with them. Assuming you won\u2019t be forgoing food during the long weekend, making a simple dinner plan could go a long way in placating your partner.", "Hell yeah, do your thing! Enjoy your vacation", "That sounds reasonable to me. NTA.", "I think he meant the other way around. As in such behaviour would never work in his relationship with his wife. Imight be wrong tho.", "Sorry I shouldn't have assumed, that does make it better but I do hope you can spare a few hours to do something nice with her", "Soo, going to dinner would be fine but going for a hike or running a bunch of errands isn't? That's reasonable. Speaking of which, are you expecting your girlfriend to clean up after you, or are you going to keep your end of the household up/take care of it beforehand? \n\nIt's context. Context generally matters. If you want to spend 4 days straight playing the Metal Gear Solid Collection, that's kinda ridiculous, given the games have been out for 15+ years. \n\nThe only argument the girlfriend had for the amount of time you were taking is if it was a considerable portion of your allotted time off and this definitely isn't. You still have 3 weeks left. NTA\n\nI will say your girlfriend probably feels bad that you want to spend a lot of time doing something that excludes her. Maybe extend it a day before and spend the whole day with her if she's amenable to that? \n\nOne of my clanmates sent his wife to a spa for a few days when Destiny 2: Forsaken released.", "Exactly this. Also the fact they are are a fully grown adult and if they wanna play a video for four days straight (taking from their own time and given advanced notice of said event) I really can\u2019t see why anyone would have the audacity to tell them otherwise! \ud83e\udd23 NTA OP. If OP said he wanted to take four days off to go on holiday no one would blink twice.", "You're agreeing with me. I stated I have no problem with taking 2 days off work to play a video game.", "How has the health of your relationship been since your decision?", "Nah F all that, it's 1 weekend, some partners act like they own you and your time \ud83d\ude02. If he wants to hermit and be all about himself and doesn't want to see her or any other human for an entire weekend it should be fine. Should not have to placate her, especially with this type of notice up front. There's no kids or major responsibility he's leaving her. Sounds like she's got attachment issues tbh.", "No I'm not expecting her to clean up after me, I'll still be doing my household chores over the weekend. \n\nWith the point about the game mattering I disagree because even with the example you gave, I haven't played any metal geal solid apart from 5 so for me and a lot of other people they would still be new games.", "Being in a relationship is not about doing whatever you want whenever you want with no regard for your partner. He has 96 hours to play this game and he's telling his girlfriend he's spending 0 of those hours with her.", "Well you and I aren't in a relationship with OP and thus do not have a full picture of what\u2019s going on.", "But they exist now. You could just play them now and not nolife them if you wanted to. The argument is that there are a lot of games coming out before the end of the year it would be a little ridiculous to want to play nonstop for 4 days. That's all. I'm not trying to impugn your choice of games.", "Well based on what he has said, there's absolutely no reason he's not allowed to be selfish and completely about himself for one long weekend, especially with plenty of notice. Wouldn't bother me if my partner did that and I would be annoyed if my partner tried to 'break mine up'. It's not like it's every weekend or a regular thing, your partner doesn't have to placate you and have dinner with you when they go on holiday with their friends and vice versa. We're all entitled to uninterrupted scheduled time with ourselves (in as long as you're not leaving kids or something like that for the other person to deal with).\n\n\nSounds like a suffocating level of attachment from her", "Oh yeah I get they exist now but if everyone thought like that then the collection wouldn't be in demand. I guess it's a good starting point for poeple who want them all together. I personally don't plan on getting them since there's enough coming out this year that I want already", "NTA. I literally just did this, took a PTO day on a day no one would be home. I don\u2019t play video games but I worked in my garden and did some other things around the house I\u2019ve wanted to do that haven\u2019t been a priority. Use your time as you see fit, as long as you\u2019re not spending every other weekend playing video games solidly then your girlfriend should not care if you\u2019re still available for days off at other times to do relationship related activities.", "Your gf is the asshole. Simple as that. \n\nI\u2019m a 52 yr old woman and I say take the fucking PTO to play the game you\u2019re excited about!!! \n\nAnd tell your girlfriend I said to grow the hell up and learn to be loving and supportive of your happiness. And if she isn\u2019t willing to do that then she ain\u2019t the one for you.", "Whats the difference between going on a boys camping trip and not being available for a few days or actually being around for emergencies but just not being available. Idk if u don't live together then ignore her. She probably just had a negative view on video games all together, either personally or just her enviroment tailored a distaste for it,\n\n (growing up making fun of nerds or people who wasted there time doing things that they didnt personally value*\n\nI'd look back on ur relationship and see if u can remember her commenting on people choosing to do things with their time that she personally doesn't value and there for can't understand why you would do such a thing. Im sure a bunch of people will just tell u to dump her or whatever but, realistically she just doesn't value video games im guessing. And subconsiously thinks you putting so much effort to do something of no value is dumb. Its just a lack of respect for you and your views/beliefs and an ignorance of what some of those things are. I wouldnt be suprised if she has been dismissive of other things that you value but she doesnt just because she doesnt value it. It's a maturity thing but is something that some people never learn. To care/value someone's interest even if they don't value it personally.", "I'm excited for starfield too, NTA", "its your time to use so use it...if you wanna play a video game then do it....why be dictated to by a woman....sadly women want things done their way most of the time and because its something you enjoy they will do everything they can to screw up that enjoyment.....try sitting down for 5 mins after work and watch how fast she asks you to do something.......you arent an arsehole...use the time to play the game and use that time to decompress and if that fails then i think you need a new girlfriend and there are plenty of gamer girls out there so tryt finding one with  similar tastes", "Coming from someone who used to get very turned off by my SO doing things like this, you might not be right for each other. You are both right here in that you should both feel good about your own decisions and the decisions of your partner. You should definitely be able to take a few days if you want to and she should not have to feel the ick about how you spend your time. Both of you are right....just maybe not right for each other.

My boyfriend is a gamer, he games I watch movies, but I do game too. We go out and do stuff but sometimes I want more time because he plays video games 95% of the time we have together. He will buy a new game and play it for days at a time. But when I ask him to do something we either do it that day or a few days following. If you had planned to take it off SPECIFICALLY for that game then YNTA but if you had planned to hang out with her then YTA. It's a bit more complicated than people seem to understand. From a girls perspective, you might be but being a girl who games especially with new games you might not be. It all depends on what was discussed prior to the situation.", "I'm going with YTA even though I see the hundred of other NTA\n\nI took time off to play the new Horizon Forbidden West, and I took time off to play the new Zelda Tears of the Kingdom. But I still made time in the evening to go out to dinner with my wife and do other stuff with her those weekends / weeks.\n\nIf you're in a relationship you can compromise and things don't have to be so extreme.", "NTA - but Id be investigating why your partner is so insecure and demandy of your time like this.  \nAre you meeting her needs of meaningful time together? Can you meet them? is she secure in the relationship?  \nCan you at least promise a meal out together that weekend?", "So taking those days off for a game is fine. But you can\u2019t ignore your social responsibilities for the game. You\u2019re taking leave from work. Not life.\nSet aside a few hours for your SO. You\u2019ll probably want to take a break anyway since playing for 96 hours straight can be exhausting. Plan those breaks around your partner.\nIf the game you\u2019re playing is Baldurs gate then maybe ask her if she wants to play too?", "When\u2019s the last time you did something with your girlfriend? Sounds like she doesn\u2019t feel very prioritized.", "NTA.  \nWhen the latest Doom was released (I'm not a gamer, don't come at me, I don't know the name of it), my bf warned me that he would be unavailable for the full week following the release. He asked for his PTO to use specifically for playing. I did meet him one of those days for a date, and we texted and everything, but he had the freedom to enjoy his time. We now live together and he recently did the same for Resident Evil 4. He's an adult, he's spending quality time with me, we're being responsible adults buying groceries and paying our bills, he's keeping up with his part of household chores. I see no harm in him using his hard earned PTO on something that makes him happy. I know that if the roles were reversed, I have every right to use my PTO however I see fit. Being in a relationship means being a team, and that includes respecting each other's individuality.", "If that is what yall want to do then it's fine. What else do you need the vacation for anyway?

My bf was next to me playing the ps5 on the other TV. Those are some of my favorite weekends.", "NTA. You should be able to spend time doing leisure things without your SO sometimes.  It's not selfish to not want to be up your partner's ass 24/7/365.", "NTA. You can do what you want with your PTO. It\u2019s exciting when a new game comes out, she should try to understand that. You have other weekends to spend together. Unless there was a big event that weekend that you were already supposed to go to and had promised to go with her. But if not, then I don\u2019t see an issue. \n\nI\u2019m a gamer. I often take PTO when a game comes out or a new dlc drops. My bf is cool with it and understands how I feel about it.

You can use it for whatever you want to enjoy.", "NTA. I could see if you weren't spending time together then it would be a problem but you two are spending time together and you have every right to use your time the way you want.

There are dad who go on week long fishing trips and stuff leaving their wives and kids at home. Doesn't sound like you have kids so this should be a complete non-issue. She can go to her events alone.", "NTA. But speaking as a gaming widow, you better make sure she\u2019s okay with you gaming in your free time.

Even married couples, long time married couples, don't spend every second together.  Time to yourselves *is* actually prioritising the relationship in the long run, because everybody needs time to themselves to pursue their own interests, for sanity and peace of mind, making for a happier partnership with lasting power.  Your gf is being selfish, self-centered, controlling, and unreasonable.  You've  planned this in advance, given her plenty of notice, and you're not cancelling any set plans. She can deal. Take your PTO and enjoy your game.", "NTA,  you're just taking 2 days.  Crazy if you were together just a whole year that's just 1/2 a percent of the time you've been together.

No one said he was gonna ignore her for 4 days, no one said completely shut people or your significant other out for multiple days at a time and completely isolate yourself but wanting PHYSICAL space from other peoples energy is perfectly okay and healthy.", "Being home and playing a game is not the same as not interacting with her at all. And even still, you can love someone and go a couple days without talking to them. People are really out here thinking that being in each other's pockets 24/7 is the only way to have a \"real\" or \"good\" relationship and that's just ridiculous.", "What's crazy is thinking that being away from your partner for four days is unreasonable. That's called co-dependency.", "What!?!? He didn\u2019t say he wouldn\u2019t speak to her for 4 days\u2026 he just doesn\u2019t want to hang out. People separate for more than 4 days alllll the time\u2026\nI attend conferences, some people attend work functions, vacation with just friends, are deployed overseas, just go away to decompress. \nThese people still have relationships and love their SO. He can text good morning, good night, or send an update about his favorite features in the game\u2026 and not be in person. Maybe he DOES want to go no contact for 4 days\u2026 doesn\u2019t mean he doesn\u2019t love her! \nIf she were on a cruise she would likely have little to no signal at times unless she pays for the data package\u2026 Doesn\u2019t mean she wants to break up. \nLoving someone is knowing you can step away from time to time and know they will be there when you return waiting to catch up to share your adventures while apart.", "[removed]", "Im with you on this, if one of us doesn't do a chore it doesn't become the other persons problem. Not sure why you got downvoted. Vacation means vacation, we've got all major chores planned pre baldurs gate 3 release, PTO booked, chores will stack up while we play for a few days and then we'll pick them up after. Why would you do chores during your holiday days!?", "Right?! You wouldn't go on holiday and then occasionally call into work for an hour in the evening", "No one asked him to \"be with his partner constantly\". Just for a few hours out of 96.\n\nAlso, thank you for making my point for me: spending your time on one thing 24/7 is not healthy. Time apart and outside hobbies are a healthy part of a relationship with gaming. Gaming 24/7 is not, trying to dictate your partner's feelings is not, and implying that your partner is not important to you is not.\n\nEdit: Corrected typo in \"Gaming\".", "If OP is excited enough to book a weekend off, I wouldn't be surprised if it's on pre-order.", "Are you doing alright? You seem wound up a little bit.\n\nMy wife of 15+ years just spent 10 days out of town. We still called like 3 of those evenings. Maybe we just like each other?", "Okay, then tell OP to break up with them.", "they're making a distinction without a difference. it doesn't matter what the game is or when it comes out, if it's how you want to spend a long weekend to unwind, since it's not impeding any other responsibilities (and there are plenty of other days you can spend together), it's totally fine to choose that.", "Wanting a few days to focus on a hobby isn\u2019t telling your partner they aren\u2019t important FFS.  Obviously you hate gamers and gaming.", "Lol, why would I do that? I mean it's definitely a red flag but it's not my problem", "Then why are you against me telling OP to do something different?", "You're free to tell OP whatever you want, I'm free to disagree"]}
