This doesn't even make sense.  How can 4 adults sleep in one bed?   Are you all 3 feet tall and very slim?  \n\nWhy can't they stay at your house in another room?

They made you sleep in the same hotel room with them although you live just around the corner? That's weird af.\n\nAnd now they want one bed for 4 people? That's just ridiculous!

You have two rooms now but they still want to force you to come to their bed?!?", "NTA. Did you marry Charlie Bucket?", "NTA. Sharing one room with two beds wouldn't be unreasonable. Sharing one bed is weird.", "NTA\n\nIt's SO weird to sleep in the same room with your parents in law. I'm surprised you gave in to them during the first time.\n\nThe 2nd part where it's sharing a bed?! Utterly inconceivable!!!", "They are trying to save money? So why do they insist you sleep with them in the same room? It is much cheaper to sleep at home, imho...\n\nNTA, boundaries need to be set.

I think this is a matter of cultural difference, but you should not be forced to share a bed with someone  if it makes you uncomfortable. Encourage your husband to speak up for you.", "Omg this is weird AF. YWNBTA to say no/get your own room. I\u2019d say this is definitely a boundary you should insist upon.", "NTA.

You married into a hella odd family. Exactly what culture requires adult children to share a room & a bed w/ their parents? I'm super curious. I'm also wondering why you two even agreed to it to begin with. This is a unique conundrum for sure.", "NTA, they are dragging a 20+ years umbilical cord, this is creepy AF and boundaries absolutely should be a topic here.", "NTA not by a long shot.\nWe are lucky to be very close with our parents. We have spent many vacations and outings together, sharing houses, homes, staying at the same hotel. We also switched homes when husband and I lived in another country so we switched beds as well, we don't care who sleeps in our bed in the family.\nBut we draw the line at sharing the room or the bed. Even if one of us is ending on a couch to do so. \n\nYou are all adults, you get your bed and your privacy, that's not normal to ask that of you. Stand your ground and get your room, I am sure the hotel can arrange for the same floor.", "YWNBTA. Wanting your own space is completely understandable and it's okay to want privacy. I absolutely would not want to share a room with my parents on my own, much less a bed.\n\nI'm also guessing you and your husband would be paying for your room? If so, it's your money and you decide what to do with it.\n\nThat being said, what about your and their cultural background? Is it common in their culture to share a room with your parents as an adult or also when married? You could explain that it is not so in your culture, if that's the case, and ask them to respect your wish for privacy.", "NTA that\u2019s just weird", "NTA Imagine how much money everybody would save by them sleeping on the sofa at your house. I'm calling bullshit on this motive.", "Never apologize for setting boundaries", "NTA\n\nThe most toxic thing we tell one another is that marriage is all about compromise.  It is - to a point.  Everyone has, and is entitled to - a hard stop.  Those hard stops are where we make our boundaries.  There is no compromise beyond that.\n\nFlat-out tell them that you WILL NOT sleep in a room with another couple.  It's uncomfortable for you, and you don't care whose parents they are; you don't swing that way.  Tell them it's not about money, and if they need the money so badly, they shouldn't travel.  Then tell your husband that if he insists on staying in this couple's room, and their bed - whether or not they're his parents - then who's to say he won't sleep in the next couple's bed, if you travel with friends?  If they think you're taking it all wrong and being disgusting, tell them all to hold onto that feeling, because that's how you feel right now:  Creeped out, disgusted, and supremely uncomfortable.\n\nStand your ground.  You don't have to do this.  Remind your husband that it's just as easy for you to turn around, go back home, and pack up his stuff so he can move back in with his parents and sleep in their bed every night.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
