Wishing you the best!!", "YTA.\n\nYou may not realise it, but this is an alcohol problem. Forgetting your little brother\u2019s birthday party and getting steaming drunk in the morning is a problem. You have an alcohol problem when it starts disrupting your life, even if you think it\u2019s under control. Not all alcoholics are those who can\u2019t go a few hours without a drink. There are many functioning alcoholics. I say this as someone who has a tendency to abuse alcohol and who regulates themselves accordingly to stop it from disrupting my life. \n\nTurning up to a toddler\u2019s birthday party steaming drunk by 1pm is trashy. Slurring your words is not okay. This isn\u2019t \u2018I had a pint and forgot\u2019, it\u2019s several drinks in. \n\nThe fact you also forgot your uncle is a recovering alcoholic and didn\u2019t even deign to think he might be at a family event is kind of concerning, because clearly it is not a good idea to be visibly and smell-ably drunk in front of a recovering alcoholic that you are supposed to care about. Either you\u2019re really immature in your thinking (which is possible because you\u2019re 18) or right now, the highest priority in your life is day drinking everyday with your mates. And that\u2019s really sad. Because if you\u2019re doing that everyday then there\u2019s a lot of life you\u2019re missing out on because you\u2019re drunk. \n\nTo be clear: this is not a tradition. Are you going to get drunk every morning for the rest of your lives because \u2018tradition\u2019? No. It\u2019s a routine. A tradition is about passing something on to others that you believe in or follow. Are you genuinely saying that you revere day drinking so much that it\u2019s something you celebrate on a daily basis? Because that\u2019s what tradition means. \n\nDid you ever see your uncle drunk before he entered recovery? Because drinking every single day in the morning is in that territory. You might think you and your friends look cool and like it\u2019s under control, but to everyone else, someone drinking every day in the morning looks like an absolute mess. \n\nI\u2019m being blunt with you because I know what it is like to abuse alcohol. I\u2019ve also had family who are alcoholics, including an uncle who died from it and spent his last few years in a home in his 60s, incontinent and not really aware of what was going on around him and having to be cared for 24/7. He had drunk every day for most of his life. He thought nothing of going to the pub in the morning. He would have said it was tradition, because it was something he had done with his father daily.", "Of course you're the asshole.

You drink every day, and forgot an important family event because of it.\n\nThen I saw that you have alcoholism in your family. Do you not know alcoholism runs in families? There is genetic disposition to alcoholism. You are falling into it at such a young age, and you're too ignorant to even realize it. I come from an alcoholic family. It is not pretty. Here are some possible scenarios if you don't get your act together:\n\nYou keep drinking every day. At some point it changes from doing it out of tradition, to having your first drink of the day because you feel like crap without it, and you keep drinking throughout the day to feel normal. You may already be at this point, but not so bad yet that you can't quit if you committed to it. The longer this cycle continues, it will take more and more drinks every day to feed your cravings just to feel normal. You'll get to the point where you can't function without alcohol in your blood. You will wake up shaking, sweating, and heart racing until you start drinking. You'll be drunk to some level every single day, even though your tolerance will have grown to a point won't even realize how drunk you are. If you have any loved ones still in your life, you will try hiding your drinking. \n\nBut the booze will still be strong on your breath, and everyone around you will know you're a drunk. Forget about maintaining a job. You'll start having blackouts aka losing time as your tolerance allows you too keep such a high blood alcohol content that it stops parts of your brain from functioning. You'll be driving drunk. If lucky, that'll end when the cops nail you for DWI, throw you in jail, and take your license. If unlucky, you get in a car wreck and kill or seriously injure someone or yourself. Then you go to prison. Just wait until you experience DTs the first time you aren't able to drink. You will wish for death.\n\nWhile all that is happening, the constant alcohol in your blood will be wreaking havoc on your organs. My father died with alcoholic induced dimensia (the alcohol and byproducts in his blood damaged his brain), along with liver cirrhosis and cancer. For two years he couldn't remember what happened the day before. He was in extreme pain for the last year of his life. He was too far gone to even realize what was going on. He couldn't even leave the house because he would wonder away and get lost in a neighborhood he lived in for 20 years.\n\nRealize what's happening and stop before it's too late. Please.

Alcohol is a poison that we enjoy the effects of, and it's mild enough in the doses we usually drink it that we can recover just fine. The amount and frequency you're drinking is NOT FINE. It isn't a question of if, but when you will damage your body beyond repair at this rate. Yes, you have friends that are also doing it and would probably laugh at you if you said it was a bad idea- they're wrong. It's a bad idea, it will have and is already beginning to have negative consequences which you will regret. \n\n  You could stop if you wanted? Why don't you want to? Do you want your organs to work, do you want your family to trust and respect you, do you want to be invited to their birthday parties, do you want to live without a huge life-altering dependency?
