Wishing you the best!!", "YTA.\n\nYou may not realise it, but this is an alcohol problem. Forgetting your little brother\u2019s birthday party and getting steaming drunk in the morning is a problem. You have an alcohol problem when it starts disrupting your life, even if you think it\u2019s under control. Not all alcoholics are those who can\u2019t go a few hours without a drink. There are many functioning alcoholics. I say this as someone who has a tendency to abuse alcohol and who regulates themselves accordingly to stop it from disrupting my life. \n\nTurning up to a toddler\u2019s birthday party steaming drunk by 1pm is trashy. Slurring your words is not okay. This isn\u2019t \u2018I had a pint and forgot\u2019, it\u2019s several drinks in. \n\nThe fact you also forgot your uncle is a recovering alcoholic and didn\u2019t even deign to think he might be at a family event is kind of concerning, because clearly it is not a good idea to be visibly and smell-ably drunk in front of a recovering alcoholic that you are supposed to care about. Either you\u2019re really immature in your thinking (which is possible because you\u2019re 18) or right now, the highest priority in your life is day drinking everyday with your mates. And that\u2019s really sad. Because if you\u2019re doing that everyday then there\u2019s a lot of life you\u2019re missing out on because you\u2019re drunk. \n\nTo be clear: this is not a tradition. Are you going to get drunk every morning for the rest of your lives because \u2018tradition\u2019? No. It\u2019s a routine. A tradition is about passing something on to others that you believe in or follow. Are you genuinely saying that you revere day drinking so much that it\u2019s something you celebrate on a daily basis? Because that\u2019s what tradition means. \n\nDid you ever see your uncle drunk before he entered recovery? Because drinking every single day in the morning is in that territory. You might think you and your friends look cool and like it\u2019s under control, but to everyone else, someone drinking every day in the morning looks like an absolute mess. \n\nI\u2019m being blunt with you because I know what it is like to abuse alcohol. I\u2019ve also had family who are alcoholics, including an uncle who died from it and spent his last few years in a home in his 60s, incontinent and not really aware of what was going on around him and having to be cared for 24/7. He had drunk every day for most of his life. He thought nothing of going to the pub in the morning. He would have said it was tradition, because it was something he had done with his father daily.", "Of course you're the asshole.

I\u2019m 18, I used to get drunk every day from 16 until a few months ago. I denied it, but I was an *alcoholic* and you are too. Showing up to a 2 year olds birthday party while drunk is wrong. You need help", "Alcohol impairs memory outside of just blackouts and foggy nights.\n\nhttps://www.verywellmind.com/alcohol-damages-day-to-day-memory-function-62982", "Let\u2019s be honest. Most Americans aren\u2019t mature enough to be able to reasonably drink before (or even after the age of 21).", "Because you act like it\u2019s normal that you turned eighteen and have been drunk all day ever since. YTA, btw. Seek help.", "> I could definitely go without it if I wanted to. \n\nSaid like a true addict.", "> I could definitely go without it if I wanted to\n\nSo what do you do during the day that you can drink every single morning for months? Work, school?", "Yeah alcoholics say the same things don\u2019t drink for the next week and see if you go through withdrawal", "You absolutely do not have it under control", "Keep it up and you can say good bye to your liver in a few years.", "I posted this on another comment OP, repeating here since you're active on this thread:\n\nI think people can get confused about alcoholism, in that they think because they can go a day without a drink and not get withdrawal symptoms that they're not alcoholics. \n\nUsing alcohol to consistently solve an issue is still alcoholism. Whether it be as an antidote for boredom, social anxiety, depression, or childhood trauma. \n\nAnd I would be willing to bet that even if you're only drinking everyday to be cool and hang out, at least one of your friends that you drink with is using it as a crutch for a mental health issue. You and your friends should all be looking out for each other rather than encouraging addictive behaviors.\n\nIf in 3 months you go to get a job and find you now literally need a drink to start the day, you're going to find it very difficult and it will be an uphill battle to recover. Is your uncle related by blood? Addictive behavior patterns run in families.\n\nPlease be wary OP. Stop while you still can.\n\nI've watched too many good people get sucked in by the allure of fun as a teen and end up in their late 20s and onwards a waster on the streets or stuck at home with enabling parents, doing literally nothing with their life and turning their brain to mush.", "I know, right? This is like saying I have a tradition where I brush my teeth every morning.", "I'm in my 30s and I'm not nearly mature enough to drink legally", "I do nothing really.

Is it to do nothing until your money runs out? Then what?", "Is that your parents money then that they saved for you? They should take it back.", "You're destroying your body and future. Good luck.", "Jesus man, you are just making one stupid decision after another."]}
