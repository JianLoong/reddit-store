A week ago, on Easter I received his wedding invite which only listed my name but not my gf ,Mary (28f). For context, Brad, Mary and I have known each other since high school . We were in the same friend group. Mary and I live around 2 hours away from Brad and Vicky. Because Mary is a nurse she doesn't always have the time to visit Brad and Vicky with me so I go alone most of the time but when she's able she'll join me. Mary has met Vicky and seen her around 10 times in the past 4 years that Vicky is with Brad. Mary and I have been together for 6 years total and we do plan on getting engaged and married once we are more financially settled.\n\nSo I asked Brad if Mary is invited and they just forgot to mention her name to which he replied that Vicky is very strict about some rules and in order to cut down costs she's enforcing a no ring no bring rule for the wedding so since Mary is \"just a girlfriend\" and doesn't have a ring to imply some formality then she's not invited. I reminded Brad that Mary and I have been together longer than he's with Vicky and that Mary is also his friend not just my partner. He says he knows and tried to talk Vicky out of it but she's very strict with that. I let it go and I was in dilemma about whether I should go to the wedding or not because of that. Mary told me she's not happy about the situation but I should go to avoid more drama. So I called them to tell them I'll attend. Vicky picked up the phone and said she's sorry about making me uncomfortable by not inviting Mary but these are the rules. I said I respect the rules I'm not necessarily happy about it though. She then for some reason started being harsh about how Mary and I are not in a serious enough relationship if after knowing each other for so long and being together for 6 years we are not engaged yet and joked that after all you never know what tomorrow brings and I could break up with Mary anytime since we haven't shown any signs of true commitment.\n\nI confronted her and told her that it's not her place to validate Mary and I's relationship and that it's really low of her to use a dumb rule just to shame and micromanage long term couples who for whatever reason haven't gotten married yet. I said I'll pass after all and not attend the wedding.\n\nShe and Brad said I'm disrespecting them and their choices by choosing Mary over their wedding day and I said I don't care. Keep your rules and I'll keep my relationship because it's more important than any exclusive rules that only exist in order to shame people.\n\nI've been receiving a lot of backlash from other friends for that choice who said I'm an AH for being so bitter about something so small. But to me it's not small.

Their wedding, their choice. It\u2019s literally impossible to invite everyone. One day away from your gf isn\u2019t that big a deal. Your friend wants you there, while an invite isn\u2019t a summons, you\u2019re free to opt out of going, but do you really want to end a decades long friendship over a plus one in a wedding?", "NTA, do they really think that their wedding day is more important to you than your gf of 6 years? Like what? The wedding day is just important for the bride and groom, not the most important thing in every guests life ffs", "NTA\n\nWhat a stupid rule, and stupid in this instance for many specific reasons. \n\nFirst of all, Mary and Brad were in the same high school friend group, so it could easily be argued that she could be invited purely based on being his friend and totally independent of her relationship with you. \n\nSecond, using marriage as a barometer of commitment is inane. So by bride's logic if cousin Chad gets drunk in Vegas and marries the girl he's been dating for two weeks, she would get an invite, while your girlfriend of 6 years would not. That is so dumb. \n\nTo top all this off, you were initially willing to let it go and just come anyhow, but then bride had to double down and insult your relationship to your face. That just sucks. Groom needs to step up and be a good friend and tell bride she is being ridiculous.", "NTA. I am so happy that you stood by your girlfriend. Your friends sound terrible though.", "NTA\n\n>But to me it's not small. They invalidated Mary and our relationship.\n\nExcluding Mary from the wedding was mean, but forgivable. But once Vicky made is clear she disrespects you, and your commitment to your long term relationship, there is no way back. \n\nShe thinks you are 'lower' than her and feels quite comfortable making that judgement out loud to your face. How can you be friends with someone who has told you that you are less worthy of respect and politeness than them? She will always see you and Mary as her inferiors. \n\nBrad is willing to let her treat you that way. He might not *like* it, but he isn't going to defend you.\n\nOnce someone has made it clear that they do not see you as their equal, there can be no friendship. That is a status divide worse than master/servant or teacher/pupil. \n\nVicky probably thinks she is being v gracious by allowing you a seat at the grown ups table instead of sending you out the back to eat with the kids.\n\nWhy would you want to support a marriage between two people who do not value you or treat you with dignity? This is not a minor issue. This is a serious misalignment of values.", "NTA\n\nI get no +1s for not long term partners, my wife and I did that with our small wedding, but our cut off was if you weren't seeing them before our invitations were recieved.\n\nAnd honestly that rule was in place to keep one specific friend from bringing their poor life choice of the week to the wedding, as they have a habit of showing up with....interesting people to very important life events only to have that person gone shortly after.", "YTA. They can invite, or not, whomever they want. You threw a little bit of a tantrum about it and then everyone got their hackles up and dug in their heels. Now what was a dumb little issue spiraled into a possible loss of friendship. \n\nOf course, Vicky is an AH too for what she said, but it kind of sounds like you provoked it during your conversation.", "NTA , but has Vicky always been this rude ? Does she have a beef with Mary or anything?", "NTA, considering the groom is not only your best friend but has also been friends with your girlfriend for longer than he's known the bride-to-be. YWBTA if your relationship were new and your gf a complete stranger to them.", "[deleted]", "NTA. They are asking you to come and validate and celebrate their relationship, while invalidating yours? Also, what a tragically simplistic view of what constitutes a serious relationship!", "ESH, except Mary. The couple probably has a limited budget and it\u2019s not your place to demand that they invite Mary. After they said no once, you should have dropped it. If you didn\u2019t want to go without Mary, you should have just sent regrets and wished them the best. \n\nVicky is also an AH for belittling your relationship, and sounds rather judgmental, but your being so insistent about your gf being invited and creating drama was provocative. She probably didn\u2019t want to say that if they invited Mary others would want their SO to come too and they couldn\u2019t afford it. \n\nYour best friend is an AH for throwing his fianc\u00e9e under the bus for the decision not to invite Mary, since it\u2019s his wedding too and presumably he has some say in the guest list. Traditionally the bride\u2019s family pays for the wedding so if that\u2019s the case, he has to respect their budget.", "NTA - you come as a pair. You showed good manners, considered their offer, spoke with your other half and agreed to go even though it wasn't the comfortable choice. It turns out the bride doesn't know how to be gracious and happy that you are coming.  You even expressed to her why you're not happy your other half is being excluded. She chose to run salt in the wound. Quite rightly you then chose to decline the invitation.\n\nOthers may not see your point of view but I do. Respect your guests and be nice to them or they won't be your guests. It's that simple. Nobody is obligated to go to a party where they would be punished for their life choices. A real friend would make an exception and actually bend over backwards to have you there.", "NTA. Vicki\u2019s comments solidified that one. She is welcome to her rules and you can choose whether or not to abide by them but to use these rules as a method to shame others and interject her opinions when not called for is AH behavior. Had she kept her mouth shut and her mind free of judgment I\u2019m sure the outcome would be different", "My understand was that he was going to go until she started dissing Mary and talking shit about their relationship.", "I know there's a huge risk for our friendship to be ruined. But I bet he also knew that risk also existed after he settled with the fact that his fianc\u00e9e disrespected my gf who happens to also be his friend.", "No, I think OP is NTA. He was going to the wedding until the bride made rude, insulting, even ignorant, comments about the OP'S relationship. She was completely out of line and owes the OP and his partner a sincere apology. I doubt, given her attitude, that she is capable of such an apology.", "But like - Mary is also one of the grooms close friends and has been since high school?  But since she's the woman and not the \"BFF\" - she's been relegated to girlfriend and not friend.  She's no longer seen as a person, just as an extension of OP.\n\nOP made clear - he isn't skipping the wedding because of the \"no ring no bring rule.\"  He's skipping the wedding because the bride to be insulted him and Mary.  If OP is really the groom's best friend, maybe the groom should step back and look at how his fiance is treating and speaking to two of his oldest friends.  Cause she's not going to change - is that really an attitude he wants to be married to / tied to for life?  If so....then OP's making the right choice.  You don't need that negativity in your life.", "Yeah, it almost sounds as if the OP and Mary were not in a relationship, Mary would have been invited on her own merits.", "[deleted]", "I respect their wedding and their choice. What I don't respect is the fact that Vicky used this as a way to disrespect my gf. And Mary is also Brad's friend not just my gf. So by extension Brad is choosing not to invite a close friend of his as well simply because she's now titled as my gf and because his fianc\u00e9e for some reason doesn't deem our relationship valid enough.", ">do you really want to end a decades long friendship over a plus one in a wedding?\n\nOP has had his relationship belittled. They seem to want to do just that.", "Just because you\u2019re entitled to make a choice doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re not an asshole for your choice.\n\nI can choose not to hold a door open for someone who\u2019s arms are full. My choice, still an asshole.", "I really tried to look past so much stuff and go to the wedding just to honor my friend. I was willing to let go of the fact that Brad didn't even invite Mary not as my gf. But as his friend. They're friends for God's sake. The fact that she's in a relationship with me now doesn't change the fact that we are friends. But it's like Vicky wanted to rub it in my face about the no ring no bring thing and how insignificant my relationship with Mary is to her.", "How did OP provoke it?", "They only are inviting married people as a plus one.  OP and his girlfriend live together and have been together longer than the bride and groom to be but are not married.", "OP was literally calling to RSVP yes and attend the wedding when Vicky started bashing his relationship. What did OP do wrong here?", "I mean, hey, if you don\u2019t want to go, don\u2019t go. It\u2019s up to you. If you think this is friendship ending that\u2019s your right to not attend and call this one over.", "Yeah i get that the rule sucks, I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s great justification either but I also get that these things are really expensive and clearly the groom didn\u2019t think he was close enough with her for her to make the cut either.", "Okay.  You're focused on the rule, when it isn't the issue.  You say \"ESH\" because OP isn't going because of the rule.  But that's wrong.  It's inaccurate.  OP isn't going because Vicki talked a bunch of shit, to his face about him and his girlfriend.   And like - the majority of my response to your comment was about that.  And you just again ignore it....like you've picked the part of the story that resonates with you I guess?  But OP is not going because Vicki insulted him and Mary.  Not because of the rule.", "Why didn't Vicky just graciously accept OP RSVPing yes? I fail to see how OP is TA for his appropriate response to Vicky insulting his relationship.", "Yeah, Vicky sucks, pretty sure I made that clear. I don\u2019t think OP is the AH rn, i think if he chooses to end his friendship with his buddy it\u2019s reaching AH territory, but I accept that others may not agree with that take. \n\nI just think this is a petty thing to end a relationship over but hey, if it really can\u2019t be forgiven it can\u2019t be forgiven and that\u2019s understandable too.", ">and joked that after all you never know what tomorrow brings and I could break up with Mary anytime since we haven't shown any signs of true commitment.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>She and Brad said I'm disrespecting them and their choices by choosing Mary over their wedding day\n\nI guess that's what one could call a \"sign of true commitment\"? \\*surprised pickachu face\\*\n\nYou are absolutely NTA for choosing your SO over their stupid wedding rules.", "NTA\n\ndoes she realize divorce exists?\n\npetty me would say its fine ill attend his next wedding \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "NTA. Miss Manners herself says that couples who live together \u201cshould be presumed to be secretly engaged\u201d and invited as a couple. It cracked me up because what an old-fashioned and stuffy way to justify doing the correct modern thing.", "NTA. Even though it's Vicky's wedding and she can make whatever rules, that is pretty crappy that she isn't listening to Brad (Her soon to be!!) because Brad seems okay with Mary being there and understands and Mary is being nice and telling you to just go. I think you did the right thing and Vicky has some issues, I wouldn't of attended either somebody dissing on my partner and our relationship.", "NTA. It\u2019s their day and they are paying for it or someone is paying for it on their behalf so they can make up \u201cthe rules\u201d they think fulfill the hole in them they think will make up for the fact statistically their marriage will end in divorce. It\u2019s for you to decide to attend or not. If you get married you can make up the rule that only those who invited your gf while you were in a relationship can attend. It\u2019s one thing to not invite your gf but then harping on it is too much. Take you gf on a fun date night instead.", "NTA! It's weird how they expect you not to come and celebrate THEIR relationship and marriage when they can't even respect and acknowledge yours and instead shit talking it! And everyone who supports them sees y'all the same way and you should know where they stand in your life!", "NTA. At first I could kinda understand wanting to cut costs cuz weddings, even cheap ones, aren\u2019t actually cheap. If they had approached you and told you about it up front, and were okay with you being a bit unhappy about it, and didn\u2019t disrespect your relationship, I\u2019d say it sucks but not a big deal.

I know life long couples who simply don\u2019t place value on marriage. My in laws were together for 20 years before they chose to get married. Anyone trying to claim that you need to get engaged to be committed is being weirdly petty for some reason. I would want an answer for why. How many others were excluded for the same reason?", "NTA. First, \"no ring, no bring\" has got to be one of the most inane things I've ever heard. I know a couple who've been together since high school, who are now in their mid 60s who never married; never exchanged rings. I know more couples than I can count, who got the engagement ring and broke up-- including me. My point is, rings are often meaningless. Meanwhile OP and his girlfriend have known each other and been together as a couple longer than Bridezilla. Talk about faulty premises for limiting plus ones. Don't go to the wedding OP. There needs to be consequences for controlling, power-hungry brides who pull stunts like this. You won't regret missing a farcical celebration with a disrespectful, entitled bride and a woefully weak groom who enables her. By the way, if she's limiting plus 1s because of budget, then the logical thing to do is reduce the guest list, or reception expenses rather than alienating family and friends.", "NTA\n\n>She and Brad said I'm disrespecting them and their choices by choosing Mary over their wedding day and I said I don't care.\n\n\"Yes, I am choosing Mary over your wedding day. Are you fucking serious? That is what you do when you are in a COMMITTED RELATIONSHIP and someone insults them and us. If you don't get that then maybe y'all aren't ready for marriage...peace out.\"", "NTA. A friend of my husband and I had a small wedding back in 2018. Only 85 people, so the couple had to be very selective about who got invites. At that point, my husband and I were \"only\" together for three years, but by that point, it was just assumed that he and I were a package deal. Where he went, I went. The fact that at the time of the wedding, you and Mary would have been together for six years by then, that says a lot.   \n\n\nAt any rate, does Vicky also not realize that divorce or a marriage annulment is a thing too?", "NTA- I would call your best friend\u2019s parents and lament not be being able to see them at the wedding due to the circumstances  but that  hopefully you can have lunch if they\u2019re still still in town . \n\nLmao. \n\nThere\u2019s nothing like parental shame .", "NTA.\n\nI get setting rules like she did to cut costs. Weddings are really expensive, and the number of people can add up quickly. \n\nBut fuck her for trying to degrade your relationship with her comments about not committing.", "NTA\n\nNext time, remind them that Kurt Russell and Goldie Hawn have been dating for 30+ years without getting married and then ask if that makes their relationship less of a commitment than someone that has been married for the same length of time? There are multitudes of reasons as to why people may date for long periods of time without getting married: finances, living situations, waiting for the right time to propose, or just not wanting to. Regardless though, a marriage doesn't dictate ones commitment to their SO. Vicky needs a reality check.", "NTA.  This is one of those relationship-defining moments.  I know Mary suggested you go in order to keep the peace, but internally I guarantee you she was hoping you'd stand up for her.  And you did.  \n\nYour relationship with the woman you've known for over a decade and been with for six years is way more important than someone else's wedding ceremony.\n\nAnd I'm also skeptical of Vicky's reasoning and wonder if Brad ever had a crush on Mary or carried some unrequited feelings.", "NTA.

These bridezillas are something else.", "Nta.  The irony here is that, as a HS friend of his, she could have been invited if the bride had simply known her as that, but since she knows her merely as your GF, suddenly her caste of being a \u2018not-engaged\u2019 isn\u2019t good enough.

People divorce every day, sone marry after weeks and others stay together forever without marrying.... you don't get to decide how serious other people are about their relationship.

Double shitty behaviour by the bride and groom. \n\nI'm sorry about it tho :/ it's hard to loose friends", "Sounds like Vicky put you in a position to choose between your friends and your girlfriend.

The couple used this rule because there was one specific person they wanted an excuse to exclude, but consequently my boyfriend at the time (now fianc\u00e9) was also not invited even though we were already living together. The wedding was several hours away and the only people I would have known were all involved in the wedding party. So essentially I would have had to spend several hours driving on the road by myself and all day at the wedding with nobody to really mingle with.

This isn't about the \"no ring, no bring\" rule (which I find incredibly stupid), this is about Vicky's blatant disrespect to both you and Mary and your relationship.\n\n\nAlso, I have a feeling this is about more than your relationship.  As you said, Brad has known Vicky for years, she should warrant an invite of her own right.  Vicky is going out of her way to exclude her anyway be treating her as the lesser half of a couple rather than another friend.

Especially in a wedding situation, you take money from family or in-laws and then they have say in how that day plays out. I\u2019ve seen it happen time and time again, where the bride is in tears because of random bullshit, right before getting married! The exact wrong time for that. I could go on and on. I\u2019ve also seen where a relative has offered money to the bride and groom to go elope, if they were going to be paying for a decent sized wedding anyway, it\u2019s a win win. They\u2019ll pay less and you\u2019ll have less stress and a much better time. But they didn\u2019t go elope and regretted it later. I can\u2019t recommend eloping in a romantic locale enough.

Neither of you have a right to micromanage who they invite to their wedding and it\u2019s very entitled to think otherwise.\n\nThat being said, I think this must be some cultural slight elsewhere because where I am from it is very normal not to always get a plus one.

There's also no law stating that because you've been dating for x amount of time your girlfriend should HAVE to be invited.  Therefore, this argument feels petty.

It sounds like you'll have to travel, which will probably take you away from your girlfriend for an entire weekend (rather than just a few hours) AND force you to endure many couple's moments all alone (dances, etc.) which likely cause you to really miss your girlfriend.

Then from there we\u2019re taking an extra two weeks for just me and my fianc\u00e9e with a few of our best friends. \n\nWe want it to feel intimate and surrounded by people we know have genuinely had our backs and been there and we want them to have fun and honor them and their relationship to us by paying for their trip and letting them have fun and celebrate life and love with us.\n\nETA: Forgot to add, there will be a \u201cno +1\u201d rule for the first two weeks unless the plus one wants to or can pay to come, or we met/know the person. \n\nThe *only* exceptions we are making is if our best friends want to bring a person that they\u2019ve been talking to on the latter end of the trip (honeymoon part) so it\u2019s not just some singles and some couples and people feel left out. \n\nKnowing some of them though, they\u2019ll probably fly solo and get on Tinder lmao.
