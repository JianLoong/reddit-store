A week ago, on Easter I received his wedding invite which only listed my name but not my gf ,Mary (28f). For context, Brad, Mary and I have known each other since high school . We were in the same friend group. Mary and I live around 2 hours away from Brad and Vicky. Because Mary is a nurse she doesn't always have the time to visit Brad and Vicky with me so I go alone most of the time but when she's able she'll join me. Mary has met Vicky and seen her around 10 times in the past 4 years that Vicky is with Brad. Mary and I have been together for 6 years total and we do plan on getting engaged and married once we are more financially settled.\n\nSo I asked Brad if Mary is invited and they just forgot to mention her name to which he replied that Vicky is very strict about some rules and in order to cut down costs she's enforcing a no ring no bring rule for the wedding so since Mary is \"just a girlfriend\" and doesn't have a ring to imply some formality then she's not invited. I reminded Brad that Mary and I have been together longer than he's with Vicky and that Mary is also his friend not just my partner. He says he knows and tried to talk Vicky out of it but she's very strict with that. I let it go and I was in dilemma about whether I should go to the wedding or not because of that. Mary told me she's not happy about the situation but I should go to avoid more drama. So I called them to tell them I'll attend. Vicky picked up the phone and said she's sorry about making me uncomfortable by not inviting Mary but these are the rules. I said I respect the rules I'm not necessarily happy about it though. She then for some reason started being harsh about how Mary and I are not in a serious enough relationship if after knowing each other for so long and being together for 6 years we are not engaged yet and joked that after all you never know what tomorrow brings and I could break up with Mary anytime since we haven't shown any signs of true commitment.\n\nI confronted her and told her that it's not her place to validate Mary and I's relationship and that it's really low of her to use a dumb rule just to shame and micromanage long term couples who for whatever reason haven't gotten married yet. I said I'll pass after all and not attend the wedding.\n\nShe and Brad said I'm disrespecting them and their choices by choosing Mary over their wedding day and I said I don't care. Keep your rules and I'll keep my relationship because it's more important than any exclusive rules that only exist in order to shame people.\n\nI've been receiving a lot of backlash from other friends for that choice who said I'm an AH for being so bitter about something so small. But to me it's not small. They invalidated Mary and our relationship.", "created_utc": 1681824641, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12qn66f/aita_for_opting_out_of_my_best_friends_wedding/", "score": 4488, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Their wedding, their choice. It\u2019s literally impossible to invite everyone. One day away from your gf isn\u2019t that big a deal. Your friend wants you there, while an invite isn\u2019t a summons, you\u2019re free to opt out of going, but do you really want to end a decades long friendship over a plus one in a wedding?", "NTA, do they really think that their wedding day is more important to you than your gf of 6 years? Like what? The wedding day is just important for the bride and groom, not the most important thing in every guests life ffs", "NTA\n\nWhat a stupid rule, and stupid in this instance for many specific reasons. \n\nFirst of all, Mary and Brad were in the same high school friend group, so it could easily be argued that she could be invited purely based on being his friend and totally independent of her relationship with you. \n\nSecond, using marriage as a barometer of commitment is inane. So by bride's logic if cousin Chad gets drunk in Vegas and marries the girl he's been dating for two weeks, she would get an invite, while your girlfriend of 6 years would not. That is so dumb. \n\nTo top all this off, you were initially willing to let it go and just come anyhow, but then bride had to double down and insult your relationship to your face. That just sucks. Groom needs to step up and be a good friend and tell bride she is being ridiculous.", "NTA. I am so happy that you stood by your girlfriend. Your friends sound terrible though.", "NTA\n\n>But to me it's not small. They invalidated Mary and our relationship.\n\nExcluding Mary from the wedding was mean, but forgivable. But once Vicky made is clear she disrespects you, and your commitment to your long term relationship, there is no way back. \n\nShe thinks you are 'lower' than her and feels quite comfortable making that judgement out loud to your face. How can you be friends with someone who has told you that you are less worthy of respect and politeness than them? She will always see you and Mary as her inferiors. \n\nBrad is willing to let her treat you that way. He might not *like* it, but he isn't going to defend you.\n\nOnce someone has made it clear that they do not see you as their equal, there can be no friendship. That is a status divide worse than master/servant or teacher/pupil. \n\nVicky probably thinks she is being v gracious by allowing you a seat at the grown ups table instead of sending you out the back to eat with the kids.\n\nWhy would you want to support a marriage between two people who do not value you or treat you with dignity? This is not a minor issue. This is a serious misalignment of values.", "NTA\n\nI get no +1s for not long term partners, my wife and I did that with our small wedding, but our cut off was if you weren't seeing them before our invitations were recieved.\n\nAnd honestly that rule was in place to keep one specific friend from bringing their poor life choice of the week to the wedding, as they have a habit of showing up with....interesting people to very important life events only to have that person gone shortly after.", "YTA. They can invite, or not, whomever they want. You threw a little bit of a tantrum about it and then everyone got their hackles up and dug in their heels. Now what was a dumb little issue spiraled into a possible loss of friendship. \n\nOf course, Vicky is an AH too for what she said, but it kind of sounds like you provoked it during your conversation.", "NTA , but has Vicky always been this rude ? Does she have a beef with Mary or anything?", "NTA, considering the groom is not only your best friend but has also been friends with your girlfriend for longer than he's known the bride-to-be. YWBTA if your relationship were new and your gf a complete stranger to them.", "INFO\n\nDoes the invite say plus one or do you get a guest? Leaving off a gf doesn\u2019t seem like a big deal but saying just you and nobody else is a real lame way to invite somebody.", "NTA. They are asking you to come and validate and celebrate their relationship, while invalidating yours? Also, what a tragically simplistic view of what constitutes a serious relationship!", "ESH, except Mary. The couple probably has a limited budget and it\u2019s not your place to demand that they invite Mary. After they said no once, you should have dropped it. If you didn\u2019t want to go without Mary, you should have just sent regrets and wished them the best. \n\nVicky is also an AH for belittling your relationship, and sounds rather judgmental, but your being so insistent about your gf being invited and creating drama was provocative. She probably didn\u2019t want to say that if they invited Mary others would want their SO to come too and they couldn\u2019t afford it. \n\nYour best friend is an AH for throwing his fianc\u00e9e under the bus for the decision not to invite Mary, since it\u2019s his wedding too and presumably he has some say in the guest list. Traditionally the bride\u2019s family pays for the wedding so if that\u2019s the case, he has to respect their budget.", "NTA - you come as a pair. You showed good manners, considered their offer, spoke with your other half and agreed to go even though it wasn't the comfortable choice. It turns out the bride doesn't know how to be gracious and happy that you are coming.  You even expressed to her why you're not happy your other half is being excluded. She chose to run salt in the wound. Quite rightly you then chose to decline the invitation.\n\nOthers may not see your point of view but I do. Respect your guests and be nice to them or they won't be your guests. It's that simple. Nobody is obligated to go to a party where they would be punished for their life choices. A real friend would make an exception and actually bend over backwards to have you there.", "NTA. Vicki\u2019s comments solidified that one. She is welcome to her rules and you can choose whether or not to abide by them but to use these rules as a method to shame others and interject her opinions when not called for is AH behavior. Had she kept her mouth shut and her mind free of judgment I\u2019m sure the outcome would be different", "My understand was that he was going to go until she started dissing Mary and talking shit about their relationship.", "I know there's a huge risk for our friendship to be ruined. But I bet he also knew that risk also existed after he settled with the fact that his fianc\u00e9e disrespected my gf who happens to also be his friend.", "No, I think OP is NTA. He was going to the wedding until the bride made rude, insulting, even ignorant, comments about the OP'S relationship. She was completely out of line and owes the OP and his partner a sincere apology. I doubt, given her attitude, that she is capable of such an apology.", "But like - Mary is also one of the grooms close friends and has been since high school?  But since she's the woman and not the \"BFF\" - she's been relegated to girlfriend and not friend.  She's no longer seen as a person, just as an extension of OP.\n\nOP made clear - he isn't skipping the wedding because of the \"no ring no bring rule.\"  He's skipping the wedding because the bride to be insulted him and Mary.  If OP is really the groom's best friend, maybe the groom should step back and look at how his fiance is treating and speaking to two of his oldest friends.  Cause she's not going to change - is that really an attitude he wants to be married to / tied to for life?  If so....then OP's making the right choice.  You don't need that negativity in your life.", "Yeah, it almost sounds as if the OP and Mary were not in a relationship, Mary would have been invited on her own merits.", "[deleted]", "I respect their wedding and their choice. What I don't respect is the fact that Vicky used this as a way to disrespect my gf. And Mary is also Brad's friend not just my gf. So by extension Brad is choosing not to invite a close friend of his as well simply because she's now titled as my gf and because his fianc\u00e9e for some reason doesn't deem our relationship valid enough.", ">do you really want to end a decades long friendship over a plus one in a wedding?\n\nOP has had his relationship belittled. They seem to want to do just that.", "Just because you\u2019re entitled to make a choice doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re not an asshole for your choice.\n\nI can choose not to hold a door open for someone who\u2019s arms are full. My choice, still an asshole.", "I really tried to look past so much stuff and go to the wedding just to honor my friend. I was willing to let go of the fact that Brad didn't even invite Mary not as my gf. But as his friend. They're friends for God's sake. The fact that she's in a relationship with me now doesn't change the fact that we are friends. But it's like Vicky wanted to rub it in my face about the no ring no bring thing and how insignificant my relationship with Mary is to her.", "How did OP provoke it?", "They only are inviting married people as a plus one.  OP and his girlfriend live together and have been together longer than the bride and groom to be but are not married.", "OP was literally calling to RSVP yes and attend the wedding when Vicky started bashing his relationship. What did OP do wrong here?", "I mean, hey, if you don\u2019t want to go, don\u2019t go. It\u2019s up to you. If you think this is friendship ending that\u2019s your right to not attend and call this one over.", "Yeah i get that the rule sucks, I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s great justification either but I also get that these things are really expensive and clearly the groom didn\u2019t think he was close enough with her for her to make the cut either.", "Okay.  You're focused on the rule, when it isn't the issue.  You say \"ESH\" because OP isn't going because of the rule.  But that's wrong.  It's inaccurate.  OP isn't going because Vicki talked a bunch of shit, to his face about him and his girlfriend.   And like - the majority of my response to your comment was about that.  And you just again ignore it....like you've picked the part of the story that resonates with you I guess?  But OP is not going because Vicki insulted him and Mary.  Not because of the rule.", "Why didn't Vicky just graciously accept OP RSVPing yes? I fail to see how OP is TA for his appropriate response to Vicky insulting his relationship.", "Yeah, Vicky sucks, pretty sure I made that clear. I don\u2019t think OP is the AH rn, i think if he chooses to end his friendship with his buddy it\u2019s reaching AH territory, but I accept that others may not agree with that take. \n\nI just think this is a petty thing to end a relationship over but hey, if it really can\u2019t be forgiven it can\u2019t be forgiven and that\u2019s understandable too.", ">and joked that after all you never know what tomorrow brings and I could break up with Mary anytime since we haven't shown any signs of true commitment.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>She and Brad said I'm disrespecting them and their choices by choosing Mary over their wedding day\n\nI guess that's what one could call a \"sign of true commitment\"? \\*surprised pickachu face\\*\n\nYou are absolutely NTA for choosing your SO over their stupid wedding rules.", "NTA\n\ndoes she realize divorce exists?\n\npetty me would say its fine ill attend his next wedding \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "NTA. Miss Manners herself says that couples who live together \u201cshould be presumed to be secretly engaged\u201d and invited as a couple. It cracked me up because what an old-fashioned and stuffy way to justify doing the correct modern thing.", "NTA. Even though it's Vicky's wedding and she can make whatever rules, that is pretty crappy that she isn't listening to Brad (Her soon to be!!) because Brad seems okay with Mary being there and understands and Mary is being nice and telling you to just go. I think you did the right thing and Vicky has some issues, I wouldn't of attended either somebody dissing on my partner and our relationship.", "NTA. It\u2019s their day and they are paying for it or someone is paying for it on their behalf so they can make up \u201cthe rules\u201d they think fulfill the hole in them they think will make up for the fact statistically their marriage will end in divorce. It\u2019s for you to decide to attend or not. If you get married you can make up the rule that only those who invited your gf while you were in a relationship can attend. It\u2019s one thing to not invite your gf but then harping on it is too much. Take you gf on a fun date night instead.", "NTA! It's weird how they expect you not to come and celebrate THEIR relationship and marriage when they can't even respect and acknowledge yours and instead shit talking it! And everyone who supports them sees y'all the same way and you should know where they stand in your life!", "NTA. At first I could kinda understand wanting to cut costs cuz weddings, even cheap ones, aren\u2019t actually cheap. If they had approached you and told you about it up front, and were okay with you being a bit unhappy about it, and didn\u2019t disrespect your relationship, I\u2019d say it sucks but not a big deal. However, since they kinda sneaked this on you guys, wasn\u2019t understanding that you were upset, and then went on to belittle your relationship? FUUUCK that.

I know more couples than I can count, who got the engagement ring and broke up-- including me. My point is, rings are often meaningless.

There needs to be consequences for controlling, power-hungry brides who pull stunts like this. You won't regret missing a farcical celebration with a disrespectful, entitled bride and a woefully weak groom who enables her.

We caught a little flack from a few people because they weren\u2019t invited, but they couldn\u2019t be too mad because no one was. The thing with having big weddings is obviously they cost a hell of a lot of money, and are very stressful for many people, especially the bride and groom. With smaller weddings you have to start cutting people off the invitation list, which also sucks and has its own stresses and drama like OP mentions. On our wedding went to the Caribbean for 10 days (2 locations), all in for flights, awesome villa, and wedding was $7k and was completely stress free and amazing. A few hours before we got married we had just gotten off of a boat where we had went to another area to paddle board. No worrying about some drama with in-laws or a drunk friend or anything. When I told my future father in law about our plan and how we were going to pay for it ourselves, he was quite relieved, as they don\u2019t have much money and I hate taking it from people also. Especially in a wedding situation, you take money from family or in-laws and then they have say in how that day plays out. I\u2019ve seen it happen time and time again, where the bride is in tears because of random bullshit, right before getting married! The exact wrong time for that. I could go on and on. I\u2019ve also seen where a relative has offered money to the bride and groom to go elope, if they were going to be paying for a decent sized wedding anyway, it\u2019s a win win. They\u2019ll pay less and you\u2019ll have less stress and a much better time. But they didn\u2019t go elope and regretted it later. I can\u2019t recommend eloping in a romantic locale enough.

Neither of you have a right to micromanage who they invite to their wedding and it\u2019s very entitled to think otherwise.\n\nThat being said, I think this must be some cultural slight elsewhere because where I am from it is very normal not to always get a plus one.

There's also no law stating that because you've been dating for x amount of time your girlfriend should HAVE to be invited.  Therefore, this argument feels petty.

It sounds like you'll have to travel, which will probably take you away from your girlfriend for an entire weekend (rather than just a few hours) AND force you to endure many couple's moments all alone (dances, etc.) which likely cause you to really miss your girlfriend.

Vicky\u2019s clearly being rigid about it, leaving Brad with not much he can do.", "> So by extension Brad is choosing not to invite a close friend of his as well simply because she's now titled as my gf\n\nYou're right to call them on this. To invalidate her status as friend because she is now defined be her relationship to you is rank misogyny and they should feel ashamed of that.", "Good for you. I can\u2019t imagine going to the wedding of anyone that went out of their way to disrespect my relationship.", "NTA but big curious (as I'm sure others are): is there any history beyond friendship between Brad and Mary?", "My guess is Brad at some point had a crush on Mary and Vicky can't stand that. She outdatedly assumes that if Mary is not committed to OP, she might have designs on Brad. I might be wrong, good riddance either way.\n\nNTA", "Exactly.

I'm starting to think that \"unrealistic movie trope\" of \"You don't understand let me explain\" where the plot only happens because the main character doesn't actually take the time to explain when they obviously had the chance, is not as unrealistic as I thought.\n\nI've seen more than a few updates of people complaining or being baffled at how people so obviously wrong getting support, yet they refuse to actually sit down with anyone and explain and easily disprove the obvious lies. Did OP just say \"ok\" and move on and not explain a goddamn thing to his other friends? There can't possibly be anybody else they know that isn't with a long term unmarried partner in their mid to late 20s. Right? There has to be others that she did this to. What is going on here?", "Nowadays it\u2019s usually made as a way to keep the guest list low. Eh it\u2019s their wedding they can impose these rules if they want to.

It's wild how many people are conflating \"no ring, no bring\" with \"no +1s are being offered\". I think a lot of etiquette is dumb and antiquated but the lack of understanding basic invite manners is surprising.", "1) I don\u2019t know why you\u2019re yelling at me. \n\n2) You stated in your comment that you have never heard of people using \u201cno ring, no bring\u201d to mean no +1s, but that is exactly how it\u2019s used in most wedding planning. It is not a term for exclusively married/engaged couples, it\u2019s typically a catch-all. The bride in this scenario seems to be more of an outlier to the rule, actually.

I reminded Brad that Mary and I have been together longer than he's with Vicky and that Mary is also his friend not just my partner. He says he knows and tried to talk Vicky out of it but she's very strict with that. \n\nYes he does.", "Did you bother reading any of this?", "No it\u2019s pointing out basic logical flaws.

Ive cut off people for doing less than just not inviting my fiance. It doesn't matter how long you've known them, if you're in a long term relationship with someone, they always come first. You don't let them be disrespected even if it's true, you tell the friends to not speak of what they don't know, and then pull your partner aside and tell them what's going on and have a calm conversation. He did nothing disrespectful, he called back to say \"hey we talked, it'll be me just coming,\" and Vickie decided to be smart. Basically saying \"oh thank God, you know I'm sorry, but it's like y'all aren't committed enough to be included in a ceremony for commitment. Glad you could understand!\"\n\n\nHonestly, it's shitty that people are saying he's an asshole. He didn't say anything besides \"I'm going to come to the wedding\" nothing warranted that response from her.

Which is very sad for her, but doesn't make her rule any less nonsensical.", "...then when they hit a hard place in their marriage, they would rather die inside the marriage than walk out alive. They will stay through all sorts of abuse, cheating, etc to keep the image of a happy marriage because of how they mocked & judged single/divorced people.", "I wonder if that is because they\u2019re not 100% certain about their decision and so need to \u2018elevate\u2019 the seriousness\u2019 of their relationship over unmarried couples because it\u2019s a way to justify their choice to themselves.", "I think I was like that in high school with my frist partner.

I do think they should be able to freely decline the invitation with no recourse.", "Yea, but it would be a really awful idea to invite more people to your wedding than the venue can accept just because you are expecting some no's. Because then if too many people rsvp yes, you have to uninvite people, which is a shit thing to do.\n\nThe better way to handle it would be to invite the people at first, then when people rsvp no, you can extend additional invites if you have space.\n\nNot saying thats the case here, since this rule is only usually meant for significant others who are so new that nobody really knows and nobody knows if they will stick around long term.", "That's fine, I was just saying that the price of one guest can be more than the cost of their dinner.", "Says they were in the same group.

Canadian? I\u2019m in BC and I find that, barring the super religious, very few put value on married vs common law after a few years.", "Right.  A good friend of mine and their partner recently came out as poly.  The discomfort some folks are suddenly showing towards them is weird to me.  Like wtf?", "That\u2019s crazy!

If a long time friend told me my relationship wasn't good enough after 6 years, especially if my SO was also their friend, I would seriously question the friendship. That's incredibly insulting and hard to come back from. It's not making the wedding about them, it's realizing the friend is shitty.\n\nI hope you wouldn't do this to your friends or family.

I decided I wanted marriage because I didn't know where we'd end up in our lives, and didn't want the chance of not being able to have either of us make decisions for the other or have life insurance get delayed or anything. \n\nMost people I know that are in their adulthood still refer to their partners as their husband or wife, even with common law.

You voted E S H which means you think OP is an AH too.", "You are disingenuous. It is not a \"plus one\". It is his long time GF, who also happens to be a friend of the groom. And if he cannot give him a plus one for his long time GF that means he does not respect their relationship and he in not his best friend. Not even a friend, really.", "Why are they entitled to Brad's presence? And why are they entitled to not have their best friend express his disappointment?\n\nWhy is Brad an asshole for telling them that their policy is stupid? I thought friends, particularly \"best friends\", were allowed to be honest and express their feelings to each other, even when they're negative?", "I think that\u2019s the big thing, dividing assets and getting that recognition. \n\nI\u2019ve actually come round to the idea of marriage more, I think because I want a floofy dress. Zombie Elvis in Vegas is definitely my speed, but I\u2019m probably going to spend the money on my yard instead. I recently committed a Reddit sin and bought a house with someone I\u2019m not married to and it is glorious."]}
