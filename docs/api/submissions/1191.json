{"id": 1191, "submission_id": "ylzt5d", "title": "AITA for not wanting to do my brother's work", "selftext": "I (18 f) am a freshman in college and I commute to college so I spend a lot of time with my family. The day started fine and continued to be a good day until I got back home from school at 7pm. My little brother (who is in high school) said \"not sure when you'll get to it, but my art project has to be done.\" He's very anxious about his grades, test scores, and was unsatisfied with the 85 he received on the last assignment. I'm not some cruel person who kicks people when they're down, so I looked at the assignment and saw it was rather simple. I handed his assignment back to him and said \"I'm a little busy but I know you can do this assignment on your own.\" He's a very nitpicky person so he responds with \"well which excuse is it, you're busy or you know I can do it.\" And then he says \"it's just art, it's not like an important class, you're just so lazy\". I then got angry. It's not as if he goes to a bad school, he attends one of the best private schools in our state. For him to be receiving a great education and yet not be paying attention in class further frustrates me. So then I said \"there's no way you expect me to believe the teacher didn't explain or teach this\". He then said \"you're useless honestly, I told you when I tried my best all I got was an 85\". Then I started shouting \"that's what you rightfully deserved you idiot\". We continued insulting each other but I kept it civil (ish). All I said was he's entitled, lazy, bratty, and stupid. He said he hoped I died, that I have a miserable life, and called my existence useless. My mom comes marching up the stairs furiously and starts shouting at me that I'm a terrible sister. She said \"we (my parents) work so hard for you to do well in college and you can't even help your brother\". I tried explaining that my art style is different from my brother's and that this is a recipe for disaster if there's ever an in-class assignment. I then proceeded to get hit (part of my leg is sore and bruised right now) and my things got tossed around (my laptop and AirPods). I kept repeating \"I'm correct and I don't care, you two are crazy\". My brother then says \"I'm glad you got hit, and one way or another you'll get this assignment done.\" I responded with \"no I'm not\". Fast forward more yelling and double-teaming on their part. My voice cracked a little bit but I'm glad that I didn't cry. I tried using logic and reasoning, but it doesn't work. At around 10:40 pm I started doing his assignment and didn't finish until 12am. I felt so disgusted with myself. That I back downed and didn't defend myself further. I didn't receive a single apology, all he said was \"I thought so.\" I'm just glad I wrote this out and put my feelings into words. This made me feel a lot better and was somewhat therapeutic.", "created_utc": 1667570365, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ylzt5d/aita_for_not_wanting_to_do_my_brothers_work/", "score": 9, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Like fr doing your assignments alone. I understand if you need help but making someone else do your homework is literally so shitty. I think your mom is a real AH for hitting you and siding with your bratty AH brother.  This is toxic af behavior. please get out of there. NTA", "NTA for not wanting to do it, but you kinda became one, when you let yourself get bullied into it.\n\nFirst of all, homework should always be done by the actual person who gets graded for it and who is supposed to do it. They may ask for help and you could have offered to give him pointers, but he should have still done it - or at least the big majority of it - himself.\n\nSecondly, if it was \"just art\" and \"not like an important class\", he shouldn't have been so concerned about a bad grade in the first place.\n\nThirdly, it's not okay of your mom to actually hit you because if it - or at all for that matter. She is raising her son to be extremely selfish and entitled. If this situation is any indication of their normal behavior you might also want to consider moving into a college dorm or getting your own place if that's financially possible.", "NTA- Email his teacher under a different email so it\u2019s not traced back to you and tell her what\u2019s going on.", "It\u00b4s his assignment so he should do it. It\u00b4s that simple. You doing it is just cheating.  \nThe whole family dynamic seems really abusive. I wouldn\u00b4t be surprised if you go no contact after eventually moving out.", "Find somewhere else to stay, press charges on your mom for assault and then send the police report which should include the supposed reason for the assault to your brother's school. Your parents are raising a lazy bully. Nta", "Y T A  for doing his homework for him. You should have stuck by your guns. How will he learn if you are doing the work for him?", "OP, your brother, starting to sound like a lazy, entitled jerk who just wants people to do his work for him, maybe it\u2019s just me or maybe I\u2019ve been reading too many r/entitledpeople posts, but your brother needs to learn to do things on his own, if he fails, then that\u2019s a life lesson he needs to learn.\nNot everybody is put on this planet to serve him.\nNTA", "NTA.\n\nYour family is paying good money for him to learn new things.  I mean, dumping work on other people is definitely a skill, and there are people who are rich because they mastered it, but I'm not sure if that's what your family is going for here.\n\nThis is not normal, stick to your guns.  (And maybe find out if there are any openings in the dorms at school?)", "NTA but you let that conversation go on way to long. Your brother basically told you to do his assignment and he was expecting you to comply. He just pawned it off on you and didn\u2019t even ask for help or anything. \n\nNot your circus not your monkey. He\u2019s taking advantage of you.", "NTA you need to report the abuse to someone. Your mother is a violent asshole, and your brother is a spoilt ignorant child. Is there anywhere you can go? Get out of there if you can.", "NTA. You are outright being abused. I would leave. You need to get out of that house for your own safety. \n\nYour Mom is insane. I think you are very much underreacting to all this.", "NTA except for giving in and doing his school work for him. But you were under serious threat. \n\nThis is **cheating**. Cheating is **wrong**. He and your mother are trying to force you to do his homework for him. If you told his teacher or principal, he might get expelled, depending on what the school's penalties are. \n\nThe fact that your mother physically assaulted over this makes the situation far worse. You can report her to the police. If you have bruises, take photos. \n\nYour brother and enabling mother are unbelievable, toxic AHs. I hope you can move out of that house as soon as possible.\n\nIf he tries to force you to do his homework again,tell him you will report him for cheating, if you feel physically safe enough.", "Yes, but ask her not to say she found out from you. Tell her to say that his work hasn't been matching up to earlier this year. I'm so sorry you are going through this.", "She got assaulted until she did, so I reallllllly don\u2019t think that\u2019s fair", "yeahhhhhh you can try to stick to your guns as much as possible but she\u2019s clearly being abused by this- More fair judgement would be \u201cYTA to yourself\u201d moment but more NTA."]}
