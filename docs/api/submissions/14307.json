Both of the twins are really attached to me they love to follow me around and just spend time with me. \n\nOkay, so my oldest has a chronic \n autoimmune disease that affects several parts of her body including her joints. She plays soccer despite her joint pain (is recommended by her doctors to stay active). But sometimes she deals with a flair-up after working out or playing soccer. Yesterday after she had soccer practice I could tell something was off she looked like she was in a lot of pain. It got to the point she was having a difficult time even walking despite using things we have to help manage her pain. My younger daughter had a dance recital that night and my oldest was still in a lot of pain and having a hard time walking. So I made the choice to stay home with my oldest to make sure she was okay. I later got a text from my wife calling me an AH for not coming to my youngest dance recital and when she realize I wasn't there she didn't want to dance anymore and my oldest is old enough and knows her pain well enough I could have came instead of staying home.

But that doesn't mske you the asshole.", "NTA. Even though your daughter is 15 and used to it, doesn't mean she won't need help doing something. Speaking as the oldest child who is often left alone when sick as early as 9 because my parents were working, it sucks handling it by myself lol.\n\nWhat's your wife doing during all that commotion? Did she not explain to your other daughter?", "NTA, your older daughter was in severe pain. She needed her parent. The younger child had a parent there to support her. I think your wife is insensitive to your older daughter's condition and shouldn't try to guilt trip you for being a good father. Severe pain because of a medical condition, trumps a 4 year old's dance recital with one parent there to support that child.", "Tough one.\n\nI feel like this is a lose lose situation. Either choice you made would've left you TA in someone's eyes. Leaving one child at home alone in severe pain or missing a dance recital leaving another child disappointed.\n\nIt's hard being a parent when you're left having to make difficult choices like this between multiple children.\n\nPersonally, I'm going with NTA. Although your younger daughter was obviously upset and disappointed you weren't there, your wife was there. The alternative would have left a child (even at 15, still a child) alone to cope in pain.", "NTA \n\nYour oldest needed you. What if she had collapsed on the floor in pain, hit her head, passed out, didn't have her phone with her or something? \n\nFour year olds don't understand a lot of things yet. I'm wondering how your wife explained your absence. Are you sure she told the youngest the truth in a nice way? Maybe it all stemmed from what she told them.\n\nEDIT:  Your wife is overreacting, imho. Sounds like there's other issues at play in your marriage. Could she be jealous of you giving your older daughter attention or accusing you of giving your daughter more attention than the twins?", "Info needed: how frequently does this happen and do you routinely stay with your teenager and skip the younger kids activities when she has non-hospitalization-requiring flares?\n\nIf this is a consistent pattern of behavior, I can see how this one event could be the proverbial straw that broke the camels back for your wife. Having a child with a chronic illness is incredibly challenging on the siblings and if your teen daughter is capable of self-managing pain flares it is important to split your time.\n\nIf this basically never happens, then NTA.", "NTA. A medical concern will trump over even a special event. You mentioned that she had difficulty walking and was still in pain despite trying things you used to do to manage pain. \n\nJust a question though, have there been similar instances wherein you have to miss your younger children\u2019s events for your older one?", "NTA. Your baby (even though a teen) genuinely needed you. \nYour younger daughter\u2019s \u201cI don\u2019t want to dance anymore\u201d is 100% from shit your current wife has said to her.", "NTA - as a disabled person one of the worst things you can hear from someone who is supposed to care about you is \"you should be old enough/have lived with this long enough that it isn't that big of a deal to be by yourself.\" That's soul crushing, and it isn't how disability works. Sometimes you need to have someone there to make it through the flare ups. You're not an asshole for being by your girl's side. Your wife absolutely is.", "Honestly I don\u2019t think anyone is the ass in my opinion. \nDo I think maybe your wife is overreacting a little yes but at the same time when your child is upset and crying because daddy didn\u2019t show up when he said he would and your dealing with a hurt child it can bring out what I call mama bear my mom had it and if anyone hurt me oh she would be pissed. And they don\u2019t really think rationally when wanting to protect their child from being hurt . The main issue I see here is that you said to your wife not your daughter that you might not be able to go but you never let her or your daughter know that you weren\u2019t coming. You just didn\u2019t show up. That\u2019s not ok you didn\u2019t even text her so that is also probably part of it. \n\nNow no you are not an ass for staying with your daughter who was in pain that is never going to make you the ass. But I do wonder if this happens more frequently like you not showing up to things for your other kids because of your daughter and that is where I\u2019m not sure because for her to have this extreme of a reaction then either this happens more frequently then your are letting on and you hurt and disappoint your twins over your daughter more. But I don\u2019t know cause I don\u2019t know you I only know this small snippet of info and because it\u2019s such a small snippet it also makes me wonder if your leaving alot out to make yourself look good. I see that all the time on Reddit. \n\nBut if it\u2019s truly a non frequent occurrence and you don\u2019t regularly ditch on your other kids for your oldest and this is the one of the only incidents like this in the 4 years since your twins were born then maybe something is wrong with your wife or she\u2019s jealous of a kid or she\u2019s just like off her rocker idk cause while yes typically a 15 year old in a small amount of pain is ok to leave home for a couple hours I don\u2019t think a 15 with a medical condition whose in sever Pain and can barely walk should be left home alone. \n\nThere\u2019s just a lot of factors I don\u2019t know so based on the little info your definitely not the ass but I can\u2019t say if your wife is fully without knowing the other info. I mean how is her relationship with your daughter? Also do you typically kinda keep them separate like the kids or something? ( not that you would again I don\u2019t know you or her) but I have read on Reddit and just in general of people who have lost spouses or something can sometimes go to extremes like trying to either blend the family and make it like the deceased never existed and then there is the opposite where they try to persevere the memory so much that they keep a divide between the half siblings and the new spouse. \nThen there is the more in the middle which is preserving the memory and not forcing things on the kids. \nThere could be an irrational fear in her that you will always choose your eldest over her kids and that might be something she needs to work on in therapy idk my suggestion is to maybe once she\u2019s calmed down try and have a talk with her cause if this is the first time she\u2019s reacted like this she might be already feeling dumb about it and she might have just overreacted in the moment due to the youngest crying and refusing to preform since dad didn\u2019t show up and so she just needed to cool down and then once she did maybe she realized how stupid it was and just is trying to figure out how to make it up to you or maybe she\u2019s doubling down because she doesn\u2019t want to admit that she was overreacting. \nWhatever the case may be I hope it works out for the best whatever that may be. \n\nAlso disclaimer my thought and opinions are based on my perspective and the info at hand. If provided new info or new perspectives then my advice thoughts and opinions are subject to change based on that new info.", "NTA Your older daughter was in so much pain she needed your full time help. Your wife should have understood that. But instead of understanding she wanted you to choose your younger daughter (her daughter) and the hell with the one who needed you more. Shame on her.", "NAH. \n\nA medical condition always trumps a dance recital. \n\nSometimes as a parent, you\u2019ll have to make hard decisions and one of your children will inevitably end up upset. What matters here is making up for it and balancing - so, your eldest needs you often, but surely you and wife can alternate between who goes to support who and where from time to time. \n\nThe biggest issue here is your wife. How involved is she with your eldest and what is their relationship ?", "NTA - OP states that this was something not of the usual pain. What if 15yo tried to move and fell and broke something? I\u2019m sure OP would have severe guilt if he had left her alone. Unfortunately 4yo had hurt feelings but it doesn\u2019t mean OP can\u2019t go to the next event. OP\u2019s wife is being unfair with this situation.", "NTA. The older child needs support from a parent. She wants to feel loved and supported when she is not feeling well.\n\nI have another question that I think is related to this issue- What is the relationship between your oldest daughter and your wife? She is not her biological daughter. Any resentment there? If she felt the need to leave town, this seems to be a bigger issue than missing a recital.", "NTA, you have a child with an autoimmune disorder who needed care. Everyone with a smart phone is able to take photos l, record, and you could have FaceTimed when the youngest was doing her dance.", "NTA. That was a hard situation for you but I think you made the right choice.  I'm aideeyeing your wife though... how does she usually act towards your 15 year old? I'd be taking a second look because she seems to have no empathy towards here.", "NTA. The reality is when you have two kids with conflicting events/recitals/games or whatever, both parents can\u2019t always be there. You\u2019re not choosing one daughter over the other, but I have a feeling that\u2019s how your wife sees it.", " NTA - You\u2019re a Great dad, but you can\u2019t cut yourself in 2 pieces. Yes, she knows the pain. But she\u2019s still in pain, she needs help or just someone to be there so she doesn\u2019t feel alone. And let\u2019s be honest, when you\u2019re 15 and your siblings are 4, it\u2019s not that you\u2019re pretty much always have to suck things up bc the younger ones come first. But you can\u2019t just leave her alone at home in severe pain, who knows what could happen. And not just will she always be your child, but with fifteen she\u2019s literally still a child. She needs her daddy in hard situations, just bc she\u2019s much older doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s ok to set her on last place to take care of.", "NTA\n\nA medical concern is more important than a dance recital. I would also say, if this isn't something that happens frequently, then your oldest will appreciate that you cared enough to stay with her whereas your younger won't remember \"that one time you missed a dance recital when she was 4\". Besides, your wife still went to the dance recital so your younger daughter still had someone there cheering her on. Oh also, she's overreacting massively.", "NTA- Holy macaroni, you wife is being a jerk! Your younger children have two parents available to them, your oldest has one. Medical issues should always take priority over extracurriculars. If the situation was flipped, would your wife have encouraged you to go to your oldest daughters soccer game while your younger children were in horrible physical pain and struggled to even walk? What if your daughter had fallen while trying to make it to the bathroom? Your wife\u2019s reaction makes me concerned for how she treats your daughter when you aren\u2019t around.", "NTA your older daughter is in severe pain and needs help to move around also your young daughter might forget about this or if she doesn\u2019t she will understand it in time you could also make it up to her with a gift of some sort", "NTA. You oldest needed you, and your younger daughter had her mother with her. Your older daughter would have had no one. You did the best you could in the circumstances. A 15 year old girl is not old enough to be left alone when she is suffering from severe pain and unable to walk. You can make up missing a recital to a kid, you can\u2019t make up for abandoning them when they\u2019re in pain. Especially considering the 4 year old wasn\u2019t alone, she had her mom. It\u2019s kind of crazy your wife is pissed you didn\u2019t leave a 15 year suffering an autoimmune flare up completely alone and thinks 15 is \u201cold enough\u201d to not need her parent. Missing a recital isn\u2019t great, but ultimately is not the action that would have done the most harm in this situation.", "nta really no one is besides your wife in this instance because she didn\u2019t explain or help your lil daughter and also belittled your older daughters illness", "NAH - there isn\u2019t going to be a right answer here.\n\nBut at this point, your littlest daughter just knows that her events don\u2019t warrant dad showing up, **and she\u2019s too little to fully understand the why.** I don\u2019t know how you fix/make that up, but surely that should be the focus.", "INFO: Is in a common occurrence that wife demands that you sacrifice stuff for 15 for the twins?

And sure, your older daughter might have been okay on her own, but what if something out of the ordinary happened, and even if it doesn\u2019t, she\u2019d still probably rather have someone there. \n\nI do wonder how your wife explained to your younger daughter that you couldn\u2019t come. Maybe have your younger daughter do the dance(s) for you at home and hype up how special you feel to get your own private show.", "NTA. Your wife was there gor your younger daughter. It would be inappropriate to leave 15 alone in that much pain. She doesn't have another patent to care for her.", "NTA \n\nI know a lot of people already said the same thing but I'll add my two cents anyway. Your daughter is 4. They get upset easily but the good thing is it's easy to make it up. Vs, like some people have brought up, the possibility of your eldest daughter getting herself hurt trying to get up to do something. It's a lose lose situation but I feel like choosing your 4 year old over the eldest would have been the worse choice. A teen will remember the only parent they have leaving them while they were at their worst vs a 4year old that still has another parent to be there at  a special event. Her childhood is just beginning. You'll have plenty of years to spend with her and hopefully more events to go to in the future. It was just bad timing. Your wife is TA here.", "Info: is this the first or just latest time you\u2019ve missed out on family/kid events bc of your eldest? I\u2019m curious bc your youngest daughter had a very strong reaction to you not being present\u2026so it makes me wonder if this is not a first time thing to be put second. That they twins also follow you around makes me wonder if you don\u2019t give them much attention so they try to make you give it. I just don\u2019t know bc for me there\u2019s not enough info about your family dynamics.", "A lot of people on here seem to think that the recital was completely inconsequential. Dancers work for months to prepare for them, and there is usually only a single performance. Several months is a pretty long time to a 4 year old. I\u2019m not saying that a health crisis isn\u2019t more important, but it\u2019s unfair to downplay just how hurt the younger one is by having her dad not show to a very important (to her) event. No judgment, because the situation sucks, but please don\u2019t dismiss feelings just because they come from a young person.", "NTA.", "info: does your daughter typically need help during a flair-up these days? was she still mobile despite the pain?", "Info: Did you talk to your oldest about if she feels she needs the help?

This wasn't a violent flu or a car accident. This was chronic pain that you're both used to managing. I can't count how many recitals I couldn't stay for due to chronic pain but I always showed up for both my kids. You only showed up for one. If your wife was angry enough to stay at her mother's over this, that tells me you put the older first all the time.
