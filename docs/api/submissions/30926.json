About a week before the baby was born my son found out that her sister ghosted her for unknown reasons. He told her that he wanted me involved because he was worried about lack of support. She told him I was never allowed to be involved because \"if she had no family to be around the baby then he couldn't either\". My son went back and forth with her where she admitted to trying to make me look overbearing to him so he would cut me off without her asking. My son and her had a huge argument and he called me after. I told him to calm down, remember she's very pregnant and needs his support and is probably scared. He took my advice and they put a plug in the argument and made up. \n\n\nIn the hospital the baby tested positive for substances. My son called me and asked me to come to the hospital because social services was obviously involved and he was terrified. My DIL admitted to using during her pregnancy, and I immediately got an attorney for my son. Thankfully the baby is healthy, and we were able to take him home with us after spending 2 weeks in the hospital and having an emergency hearing and multiple home visits. His ex isn't allowed around the baby, and my son moved in with me because we didn't know if there was substances in the apartment and obviously didn't trust her. I paid for the lease to be broken, and we have no idea where she is. \n\n\nHer family has reached out, though. They have interest in meeting the baby, but my son doesn't want them to at this point. They are being somewhat understanding of that but are still contacting him - they're not being forceful,  just telling him they want to meet the baby and asking what they need to do. \n\n\nSo, that's where we're at. I'm still so incredibly proud of my son, and grateful to be a part of my grandchilds life, but my heart breaks for both of them. None the less, I will continue to support them in any way physically possible.", "created_utc": 1699910075, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17ul3tm/update_to_aita_for_wanting_to_meet_my_grandson/", "score": 449, "replies": ["Honestly 10/10 for you.

Regardless of what other people told you, they were quite ungrateful for displacing you like that after all you did after them.", "Oh jesus what a turn.  Well, good on you for just kind of sitting tight and being available to play ring leader to the circus.  I'm sure your grandchild will appreciate it.", "*Her family has reached out, though. They have interest in meeting the baby, but my son doesn't want them to at this point.*\n\nWhy are they NOW showing interest in the baby when they kicked the minor mother(their fucking daughter) out of their own home?!?!  They need to address that if they want to meet the child.", "Wow. Thank you for helping save this child's life", "Never saw the original post until now. A bit gutted really that you were left feeling you were TA. It\u2019s clear that you have consistently done so much to help your family and don\u2019t really give yourself the credit you deserve. \nWell done for being such a great dude\u2026 and please have more confidence that you\u2019re doing the right thing in future x", "I just checked out the original post and wow. I bet a lot of people feel dumb for voting the OOP being an asshole when he was being a concerned parent to two teenage kids acting they\u2019re all growned.

I hope your son and grandchild are ok.", "Wow, this is not the update I was expecting!\n\nCongrats to your son on the new tiny human, thank you for updating us.

Lots of people actually messaged me and told me I wasn't wrong in my last post, but it was hard to see that through everyone else telling me I was.", "I think the verdict would have ended up being ESH if all this was known in the original.  OP had a shockingly bad understanding of C sections.  Like he didn't think she would bleed after because the baby wasn't coming out of the vagina.\n\nEven without all the manipulation from DIL, the total downplaying of what a C section does to the body would have caused a massive rift anyway.", "They've said that they were in shock about their 17 year old being pregnant and not knowing how to really react. However my son has told me they always treated his ex/their daughter poorly compared to her siblings so I have a fear they're hoping to take over parenting. \n\nThey always seemed disappointing when she and my son were making strides in the right direction. They just don't seem like great parents.", "Is it guilt or is it a genuine change of heart?", "OP isn't the one who posted that", "I agree. They should be independently investigated. (edit: I mean, IF son wants to consider bringing them into contact)", "On this subreddit people arent very realistic, they asume that you will give everything you have and will easily accept when people takes you out of their lives.  \nIts unnatural, of course you may give things out of love and dont expect anything back. But to give your everything and still the people you love doesnt reciprocate and, not just that, they have no problem in forgetting about you, hurts a lot and its ok for you to have felt hurt back then.", "I'd like to believe in the latter.

I'm so proud of and happy for your family, that you are taking such good care of eachother and that little one. Amazing job!", "You are amazing and I wish everyone had a parent and grandparent like you", "Congratulations!\n\nI would get an attorney for your son. He needs to gave them write a letter to stop harassment and contact attorney only.", "Two things for you to consider before allowing her family any contact.  First, is she living with one of them now and they just aren't telling you??  Second, did they know about her drug habit?  I think I'd also want to know why her sister suddenly ghosted her - I suspect the ex either asked her to buy her something or the ex stole her sister's stash.  Either way, tread carefully with that one; the correct action would have been for her to tell your son, not to vanish from their life when the baby's life was at risk.", "Thanks for the link, DFQ, you\u2019re a gem.\ud83d\ude42\n\n(edit: i didn\u2019t think About clicking on the user name to find other posts\ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f so thanks to another commenter for that as well)", "I actually had that first thought on original post and even more seeing the update.", "Is it common to run drug tests on newborns in the US? Hell we don\u2019t do that here when we know for sure the mothers have been using during pregnancy, because there\u2019s no point (it won\u2019t change how we treat the newborn and they have such a small blood volume you don\u2019t just run blood tests unless they\u2019re really sick). And it sounds like the DIL didn\u2019t admit to using until after the baby tested positive so it all was a bit suss to me", "Not one bit!

This edit changed none of that.", "If they want to take care of a child they should care for their own daughter. She\u2019s in bad shape and desperately needs help. I understand they see this baby as a fresh start but they don\u2019t get that privilege.", "I would say check your state laws because if they start visiting the grand baby they could go for grand parent rights if there's laws for them wherever you're at and they could try to push for more custody", "I had 2 C-Sections and really didn\u2019t bleed. Was up in 8 hours by doctors orders.", "No the expectations were overbearing and diminishing to her experience post partum. thinking she wouldn\u2019t be in pain and bleeding and would want her FIL first thing getting home from the hospital. That reeked of entitled boomer/grandparent.\n\nDo hope your son is doing well, and can afford some therapy after all that.  Yes it sucks that she turned out to be an addict, thank god the baby is healthy.   Congratulations on still being a supportive father I guess.", "Situations are complicated, and rarely black and white. It can be true that your son's ex is a very complicated and messy person who seems to have made some really terrible decisions, and at the same time can be true that you were vastly underestimating what the recovery from a C-section is like.", "Yeah what solidified it being fake for me was how everyone in the first post called him out for being overbearing, and then here the DIL \u201cadmits\u201d she was trying to make him seem overbearing on purpose to try and get son to cut contact. \n\nThe son clocked him for being overbearing first, when he expected to drive them and then sit in the hospital the whole time, then saying he thinks he\u2019s closer to them than an aunt, who is the 18 year old mothers sister. Sure he got the point eventually, but it feels too convenient that all of a sudden the sister drops out and now mom has a drug problem and he was right all along and now DIL isn\u2019t even allowed around the baby. \n\nWe see it a lot where posts deemed the asshole come back with crazy plot twists that show the asshole was apparently right to do exactly what everyone accepts is too much and assholeish, but miraculously the stars aligned and OP is a seer.", "You make a fair point but if I\u2019ll be honest if I had voted I would\u2019ve gone with E S H. Because everyone here was an absolute ass except OOP with a caveat: \n\nOP: who had misconstrued views on childbirth and c-sections. But whose heart had been in the right place. \n\nSon: who wanted to act grown when he\u2019s still a kid himself. \n\nEx GF: a shitty child who was using her baby daddy and his father. Who in the end of the day was using drugs while pregnant. Any mother who does that, regardless of age, are automatically jackoffs.", "EVERYONE IS DIFFERENT.", "And I know a lot of other women who did bleed after their c sections every woman is different", "Yeah, the ex is clearly a problem person.  But the amount of insisting that OP be present was legit too much.", "I am so Happy for you Op. You are an amazing Father/Grandfather.\n\nI understand that you were hurt from your original post about the whole thing but You took it in stride and reached out to at least give your support and love to your son and now grandson. I am glad that ex-DIL is out of the picture for now and you have son and grandson safely with you.\n\nI also understand how many voices pointing that you were wrong could be more convincing then the few that said you were right. I wish you all the best as well as your children"]}
