About a week before the baby was born my son found out that her sister ghosted her for unknown reasons. He told her that he wanted me involved because he was worried about lack of support. She told him I was never allowed to be involved because \"if she had no family to be around the baby then he couldn't either\". My son went back and forth with her where she admitted to trying to make me look overbearing to him so he would cut me off without her asking. My son and her had a huge argument and he called me after. I told him to calm down, remember she's very pregnant and needs his support and is probably scared. He took my advice and they put a plug in the argument and made up. \n\n\nIn the hospital the baby tested positive for substances. My son called me and asked me to come to the hospital because social services was obviously involved and he was terrified. My DIL admitted to using during her pregnancy, and I immediately got an attorney for my son. Thankfully the baby is healthy, and we were able to take him home with us after spending 2 weeks in the hospital and having an emergency hearing and multiple home visits. His ex isn't allowed around the baby, and my son moved in with me because we didn't know if there was substances in the apartment and obviously didn't trust her. I paid for the lease to be broken, and we have no idea where she is. \n\n\nHer family has reached out, though. They have interest in meeting the baby, but my son doesn't want them to at this point. They are being somewhat understanding of that but are still contacting him - they're not being forceful,  just telling him they want to meet the baby and asking what they need to do. \n\n\nSo, that's where we're at. I'm still so incredibly proud of my son, and grateful to be a part of my grandchilds life, but my heart breaks for both of them. None the less, I will continue to support them in any way physically possible.", "created_utc": 1699910075, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17ul3tm/update_to_aita_for_wanting_to_meet_my_grandson/", "score": 96, "replies": ["Honestly 10/10 for you.

Don't feel guilty (or let your son feel guilty) if what's best for the baby is not allowing \"honestly not great parents\" into their life. \n\nGood job being a supportive parent/grandparent, OP!", "Her reactions in the first post make a lot more sense now!", "Boy, that took a turn.", "It seems the problem was the non-DIL.  \nWhat an awful human being.  \nGood for you for keeping yourself there. Regardless of what other people told you, they were quite ungrateful for displacing you like that after all you did after them.", "Oh jesus what a turn.  Well, good on you for just kind of sitting tight and being available to play ring leader to the circus.  I'm sure your grandchild will appreciate it.", "*Her family has reached out, though. They have interest in meeting the baby, but my son doesn't want them to at this point.*\n\nWhy are they NOW showing interest in the baby when they kicked the minor mother(their fucking daughter) out of their own home?!?!  They need to address that if they want to meet the child.", "Wow. Thank you for helping save this child's life", "Never saw the original post until now. A bit gutted really that you were left feeling you were TA. It\u2019s clear that you have consistently done so much to help your family and don\u2019t really give yourself the credit you deserve. \nWell done for being such a great dude\u2026 and please have more confidence that you\u2019re doing the right thing in future x", "I just checked out the original post and wow. I bet a lot of people feel dumb for voting the OOP being an asshole when he was being a concerned parent to two teenage kids acting they\u2019re all growned. Im glad that the son had the intuition to keep his dad in the loop. \n\nI didn\u2019t vote on that thread but I am glad for you OP. I hope your son and grandchild are ok.", "Wow, this is not the update I was expecting!\n\nCongrats to your son on the new tiny human, thank you for updating us.

Lots of people actually messaged me and told me I wasn't wrong in my last post, but it was hard to see that through everyone else telling me I was.", "I think the verdict would have ended up being ESH if all this was known in the original.  OP had a shockingly bad understanding of C sections.  Like he didn't think she would bleed after because the baby wasn't coming out of the vagina.\n\nEven without all the manipulation from DIL, the total downplaying of what a C section does to the body would have caused a massive rift anyway.", "They've said that they were in shock about their 17 year old being pregnant and not knowing how to really react. However my son has told me they always treated his ex/their daughter poorly compared to her siblings so I have a fear they're hoping to take over parenting. \n\nThey always seemed disappointing when she and my son were making strides in the right direction. They just don't seem like great parents.", "Is it guilt or is it a genuine change of heart?", "OP isn't the one who posted that", "I agree. They should be independently investigated. (edit: I mean, IF son wants to consider bringing them into contact)", "On this subreddit people arent very realistic, they asume that you will give everything you have and will easily accept when people takes you out of their lives.  \nIts unnatural, of course you may give things out of love and dont expect anything back. But to give your everything and still the people you love doesnt reciprocate and, not just that, they have no problem in forgetting about you, hurts a lot and its ok for you to have felt hurt back then.", "I'd like to believe in the latter.  Here's to hoping.", "I know that, I just thanked DragonflyFairyQueen for putting the link to the original post of ThrowRA\\_Narcdil.  \nI know you can also find it just clicking on the username, just a nice gesture.", "From my understanding there is a process they will have to go through should my son decide to let them. I believe a background check and a drug test, but I could be wrong. We will make sure to cross that bridge correctly if the time comes."]}
