I've been successful, I help my family & I've always been considered very beautiful. I get fussed over a lot in my family. My one aunt in particular has always liked to go on about how beautiful I am & how I could have my pick of men. It's never made me comfortable, but I've known she means well & she loves me like a daughter. It seemed harmless until I met my husband 2 years ago.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy husband (38M) is amazing. He's the best person. He's smart, funny, caring & kind. He always goes out of his way to make me happy, helps my family and cares for everyone. Honestly, I'm a bit in awe that I got so lucky. I think he's the sexiest man ever, but I suppose he wouldn't be considered movie star conventionally pretty. He's extremely talented at his work - it isn't high paying, but I've never cared about that.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe issue is, some family members like to make these 'jokes' that I find really rude. Like my uncle telling my husband 'you're a lucky SOB, most guys couldn't get a girl like that **with** a full head of hair!' or my aunt saying 'it's good *Elise* has been so financially responsible & successful - that way it can balance out *your* career.' These are actual examples. My husband says he's not bothered & says it's their way of looking out for me because they love me, but it gets under my skin.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt all blew up on Christmas. My whole family was at our house & we were mid meal when my aunt decided to make a toast. It started out nice, she was going on about the dinner & how I host them in our beautiful house & they are all so lucky to have me. Then she decided to end with my husband being luckiest of all since I am so 'out of his league' - cue the laughter.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI absolutely lost it. I told her it wasn't funny, she needed to apologize, and if she or anyone insisted on continuing with these 'jokes', they could simply not to come to our home anymore. My aunt rolled her eyes. She wouldn't apologize - apparently 'it's just a joke' - which is when I escorted her out. The rest of the evening ended quickly.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy parents have been supportive, as have several of my cousins - but even they think I could have handled it with more grace. The rest of my family have been calling & saying I need to go mend fences. I have flatly refused. My husband will stand behind me whatever I do but he'd rather I just be happy since he says he never takes them seriously. Right now, I can't go an hour without a text or a call telling me I'm a spoiled brat because I kicked my aunt out on Christmas, knowing she had nowhere else to go.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI want to stand up for my husband & I want this ridiculous picking on him to end, but I'm starting to feel that maybe I was being overly cruel in the way I dealt with things.

A lot of times people think it\u2019s ok to rag on men because they should be tough, but it\u2019s not ok.", "NTA. Your aunt deserved to be kicked out. She was rude so many times in the past and has been called out and told enough was enough. She did it again and refused to apologise.

You could've made the same point without kicking her out, if you felt the need to make a public rebuke. \"That's not funny and I won't drink to that. I can't believe you expect my wonderful husband to keep putting up with your disrespect.\" ... You could've pulled her aside and told her you won't be inviting her to your home again until she offers a sincere apology to your husband and agreed to forgo such inappropriate jokes in the future. But having said that, people shouldn't be surprised that actions have consequences and I'm so tired of people letting rude behavior slide just to avoid some awkwardness.", "NTA.

It was a teasing way to praise you, and you took it too seriously. Which is understandable given the other remarks about your husband, but still. Kicking a family member who \u201cloves you like a daughter\u201d out of the house  at Christmas Eve because of a bad comment made with no or little bad intent is just too harsh, I think.\n\nA lot of people in this sub seem to think you\u2019re \u201cstanding up for your husband\u201d. I disagree. You\u2019re engaging in a conflict on his behalf. It\u2019s a little unclear whether he\u2019s hurt by the remarks or not, but he obviously doesn\u2019t want to be the center of a conflict in your family.

Just because you share blood doesn't mean she gets to disrespect you or your husband.\n\nNow, could you have done it more \"gracefully\"? Yeah, you probably could have had a private conversation with her and firmly explain what the problem was, instead of blowing up. I personally would have probably warned her that if she does this again she wouldn't be welcome anymore.\n\nThat doesn't make you the asshole though. I would also argue that if more relatives were doing this and not only her, then its good to make the point in front of everyone.\n\nGood luck with the family drama and stick to your guns, even if its tough now I think this will bring positive change for future reunions.", "I've never understood that sentiment. \"O noes, it's Christmas, you should allow people to behave badly because chances are it will be another year before you can all get together again so they can behave just as badly!\"  \n\n\nBad behavior is bad behavior no matter when or where it's done.", "I don\u2019t believe for a moment it doesn\u2019t bother her husband. I think he says it doesn\u2019t so she doesn\u2019t get upset (he seems like that kind of nice guy). OP\u2019s NTA.  \n\nHer family acts like she\u2019s their \u201cspecial prize\u201d and only they get to decide how she\u2019s \u201cused\u201d - as if she\u2019s just a pretty toy.", "Yes, this is my concern as well \u2014 what about any potential future children?\n\nOP \u2014 NTA. Don\u2019t let your family treat you and the one you love like crap in your own home."]}
