That is CRUCIAL information that you blatantly lied about in your post. I think the both of you suck for not initiating much of a discussion before the offer was given however.", "Compromise. Full blown rejection is trying to control her. Compromise to meet BOTH needs. Not a fraction less in favor of other.  That's marriage", "> I feel she skipped so many steps that I honestly feel a bit confused why she decided to go about it like so.\n\nWell, you'd know better than Internet strangers what's going on in your own marriage, and why she wouldn't have even mentioned this.\n\n~~NTA,~~ but what did she say when you explicitly asked her, \"Why didn't you discuss this with me?\"\n\n[ESH. Your comments on the thread make it clear that 1) you did not present the conflict honestly with all relevant detail; and 2) you had the opportunity to fully discuss this with your wife at the 2nd-interview stage.]", "INFO: How old are the children?\n\nSuch a big move could have a huge impact on them, having to uproot their lives and friendships for a unilateral decision to move halfway around the world - not to mention the culture shock with the new location.", "INFO: is her job paying for her relocation? It\u2019s pretty typical for companies that relocate employees abroad that they pay all the moving and relocation expenses, including the visas. \n\nNTA for your feelings, but since you knew this was one of your wife\u2019s goals, this needs to be discussed and length without you shutting her down.", "INFO\n\n>I know it has been her vison to live and work abroad at some stage\n\nClearly you two talked about this, you knew this is what she wanted and there was a possibility of this happening.  Did you tell her you were supportive of this?", "NTA, this is very clearly a \"two yesses\" type of decision. Both partners need to agree on the plan for it to transpire.\n\nIt does seem like she brought you into the picture early. Hunting for jobs can be fruitless, so I don't think it's that big of a deal that she brought it up as soon as it became a serious possibility. And it's understandable that if this is a dream opportunity for her that she indulged in the idea of what it would be like to move.\n\nI think you owe it to your wife to keep an open mind about the situation. And it's in your own best interest to apply a growth mindset to the opportunity. Ask yourself - \"what would need to happen for this to be the RIGHT decision for the family\"? Does your wife's offer need to pay a certain amount? Do they need to cover relocation costs? Do you need to find a job that pays a certain amount before the family can commit together?\n\nNobody loses by deciding what a 'win' looks like and going for it together. If the job isn't willing to offer your wife enough, if you can't find a job as well, whatever, at least you know you tried and were in it together and decided on common terms.\n\nOne last thing to consider - she is probably upset that you unilaterally made a decision on behalf of the whole family. She may not feel like you have given her a full opportunity for input and making this as a joint decision. It's still a \"two yesses\" situation, but that's not the same thing as your decision to make.", "Hmm ESH I think. A few weeks ago you should have sat down and talked about it then. Also you shouldn\u2019t have just said \u201cnot possible\u201d. Maybe start with something more open ended like \u201chow do you envision this working out for us\u201d and make it a conversation instead of you saying no", "NTA this is a huge decision that would affect everyone.  The time for her to discuss this was before she even applied.  I would be upset too.", "NTA. That\u2019s a bizarre action for a partner, I couldn\u2019t imagine my wife planning something so life changing without both of us in full agreement. You definitely need to get to the bottom of this before it escalates further.", "I rarely say something is likely a marriage deal-breaker on here but this is.  NAH.  Sometimes people grow to want different things.", "NTA.\n\nYou two are married and she should've discussed this with you further before just jumping into job applications and making plans for it. \n\nSince it sounds like you two have previously discussed this possibility... if its important to her, and you are both open to the idea eventually, maybe you two can agree on a timed plan. That way you two can both address all concerns and prepare yourselves, as well as your children, for a huge life change. This would allow you to plan better and would probably help ease any feelings on resentment on her end. \n\nIf you feel like moving out of the country is completely off the table, you do owe it to her to tell her that now so she can make an informed decision on what she would like to do going forward. She may still want to do this, whether you do or not, and she should know if it's something you aren't willing to be a part of. She probably expects you to be down for it given you two have spoken about it in the past.\n\nHowever, you two should be planning together and it was wrong for her to keep you out of the loop on such a big decision.", "NTA. It\u2019s odd for her to make this decision without including you. That being said, it could be a fun adventure for your family. But in my opinion would only be worth it if the company is covering moving costs, temporary housing, etc. I would never foot the bill to move halfway across the world for a job that may or may not be better than what can be found locally.", "NTA, this is 100% something you should have been informed of from the start. Anything this big requires both halves of the couple to be on the same page for the entire process.", "Nta.  She should have brought it up before she applied.  This is a joint decision.", "YTA. Saying this because this happens all the time with men (relocation), and women's concerns are always brushed away. Yes, you are being unsupportive. If I was her, I would move either way. Don't wanna go? Fine, take care of the kids or let me have them.\nThere was a reason why she went ahead, applied and interviewed, regardless of your opinion. \nI hope she has the courage to go follow her dreams.", "Take steps to make sure she doesn\u2019t try to take your kids out of the country. Not even for a visit \u201cto see if they like it\u201d\n\nNTA", "This is going to require counseling to resolve.\n\nAnd I mean this in all seriousness: Begin mentally preparing for divorce.\n\nShe knew what she was doing when she applied.  She may be dead set on doing this.\n\nNTA", "~~NAH~~\n\nhowever personally I'm on your wife's side, and I think your reasons are lame and not the complete truth of the matter. it's more an issue of control and power. you could make this work if you wanted to. you don't want to because you feel blindsided not because of debt and financials. I'm guessing if you got the job offer it would be a different story here... or maybe you just don't have a sense of adventure idk.\n\nedit: YTA", "NTA.\n\nCan I be honest with you OP? \n\nIf *I* were planning on leaving my husband, I too would be planning to disappear to a country with no treaties offering legal recourse, while I squirreled money away without his knowledge. I'd also make every step possible to stick him with every debt I could while benefiting from it.\n\nYou may want to start discreetly looking into your finances, her financials and her activities....", "NTA \nYour wife shutting down isn't your fault - it speaks to her inability to communicate effectively with you. I'd get a therapist to mediate this discussion. \n\nIt's not a deal breaker as long as both of you are willing to genuinely compromise. \n\nI'm an expat. It's not so bad to cross to the darker side :) Great life education for the kids if nothing else.", "NTA\n\nShe should've brought this to you before she started applying.\n\nThe wind is out of her sails because she wasn't being realistic or thoughtful of her family. She was acting selfishly.", "NAH but having known about this before the second stage interviews a few weeks ago, I think you're a bit of an AH for not properly addressing your concerns before now. What was the point of that second interview for her?", "NTA. I understand that she has a dream and she's trying to pursue that. But, she has responsibilities, and you're not wrong to remind her of that. \n\nI've been the \"reasonable\" partner in the relationship, where my partner (fianc\u00e9e, at the time) was constantly pushing to do impulsive and expensive things that we couldn't afford.

From OP\u2019s responses in the comments, it sounds like they discussed moving abroad and OP is on board with the plan, but not now (in 2-3 years time). The wife springing this on OP now does feel a bit like a random change of plans, however, it could be that this is a unique, one of a kind opportunity that requires a re-evaluation. I think OP and wife did the right thing in calmly talking it through - she might resent you for not taking the opportunity, as you might have resented her had you moved. You all need to decide if your marriage is stronger than temporary resentment, or if resentment is / would be so strong to the point that you can no longer continue on your path together. Either way, I think you're in for some more tough discussions.", "So she told you the instant this became a reality for her, and you ignored her, essentially.\n\nESH, with you being the larger asshole.

Having a dream of working in another country is great, but when you're married, have kids, and debts having at least a loose plan on when and how the dream can become reality is a must, and when a job is available details have to be worked out. Details matter when you have kids and debts. You say in a comment that it's a low cost of living country, but also the pay is low.
