(He was never legally required to) Dh is still providing for her: clothes, shoes, private school fees, tutoring, extracurriculars, insurance, phone bill, etc, but not giving his ex anymore money directly. The ex is absolutely livid over this as she's a sahm and counted on his money for well, everything. Now his ex is in a position of being in her mid 40s and never having had a job, and no longer getting an income from dh.\n\n(I'm fine with him providing for his child, she's a great kid and I love her. There is no issues there, and if dh is busy, I'm also happy to get her what she wants or needs. Neither of us would ever allow her to go without.)\n\nDh has talked to a lawyer, who said dh owes his ex absolutely nothing regarding the younger one, and his ex has no chance if she were to seek child support as dh has already gone above and beyond for a child that he has no legal claim to.\n\nEx has been calling dh and me every possible name you can think of for destroying her life and putting her in a bad financial situation, where she might actually need to work someday. \n\nAITA?\n\nEdit: he had been giving his ex $4000 a month plus $800 towards her mortgage, so it's a significant loss for her. There is no alimony.\n\nEdit2: dh told his ex several months before the oldest turned 18 that he planned to no longer give his ex money.

HOWEVER, $4000 a month for expenses + $800 towards the ex's mortgage? That's unreal. He legally owes the ex NOTHING. Assuming the girl lives mostly with her mother, DH could indeed pay towards some of the expenses of taking care of the girl, but in no way should that be almost $5000 a month! It's clear the ex is using this 'child support' as her sole income instead of getting a job. I'd do the same as DH is doing and support the girl directly by getting her education or clothes or extracurriculars. Keep an eye out for electronics and expensive clothes \"going missing\" though, maybe the ex is going to start selling some of it in order to get some cash.", "NTA. She's a master manipulator. Your husband sounds like a stand-up guy!", "NTA How did he ever agree to that!  I just hope the ex doesn't tell the 15yo she can't see your family anymore.", "NTA.  That's an insane amount of $ to give to an ex who was screwing others behind his back. Wowzah!  He's a saint.  Glad you convinced him to quit subsidizing that woman while helping the daughter.", "How does three daughter feel about it?

He's a heck of a guy for doing it as long as he has.", "NTA and make sure you\u2019re documenting everything and I mean everything. My stepkids mother refused to work full time (a masseuse) and only worked 10 hours per week. Parents are equally responsible for providing for their children. Your husband went way above and beyond taking care of this child and kudos to him for not making her feel like he doesn\u2019t love her. She absolutely needs and deserves a parent like that. Her mother is going to learn quickly and the hard way that she has to get off her ass and take care of her child. I swear when I see entitlement like this my blood boils.

The mother can pack sand.", "NTA - she had to know it wouldn't last forever", "NTA - it's a very reasonable decision. It's not like you want him to abandon the kid. I wonder what was mom's plan for when the kid turn 18 and CS would stop anyway... Will she expect your husband to provide for her forever?", "Will the child have a decent place to live if he stops paying entirely?", "INFO: is there any risk that mother will try to cut off his access to the child? I\u2019m assuming there\u2019s something of a close relationship there if you love her.

Child support is to help maintain the lifestyle the kid is used to and you just massively changed that. Buying the kid stuff is different than her mom having money for a mortgage.

If dh could afford to keep making payments for just 3 more years to Ex just to keep the peace it may be worth it to avoid both of you getting dragged through the mud by the Ex to the two children she shares w dh. Both his children may end up siding w Ex because she is their Mother and it will cause so many bad feelings. At least consider giving Ex a longer notice before cutting her off so she can job seek or get vocational education.", "$4800/mo. Wow. She saved nothing?

Hell no do not pay her another dime.", "NTA. Her youngest kid is 15, no reason why she can't get a job and support herself.", "NTA.\n\nYour husband's ex is a master manipulator, and your healthy relationship has given him the perspective to stand up for himself and his family.\n\nHis ex is an emotionally abusive grifter and getting her talons out of his pocket book is just the first step of your husband's path towards healing. \n\nOh wait, this is just inflammatory fake shit, written by a dude, with a few dear husbands thrown in.", "~~YTA.~~ DH was providing for a child he considered his, and you convinced him not to. You don't mention any financial hardship for your blended family from supporting the ex. I get that he technically owes her nothing, but I think he actually does owe her a significant amount of warning. Whether it was reasonable or not for her to depend on his payments, she WAS depending on his payments and he was OK with it until you told him not to be. He should have given her several months' notice that he wouldn't be sending her money anymore (or a gradual reduction or some kind of transition) to allow her a chance to figure out how to support herself.\n\nEdited after the comment below: If he did give her lots of warning, then it's totally reasonable. NTA.", "NTA- He has no legal obligation to do this which is why she\u2019s insulting him\n\nhowever\n\nhe created this monster so he now will have to deal with anger.  Be prepared for hee to use his kids as pawns to continue this free ride. \n\nBe strong and hold out.", "Um excuse me, your husband is essentially paying his exes whole house and house bills??? For a kid that doesn\u2019t even belong to him? Did I read that right? The 15 year old he\u2019s paying all of this for? The ex wife\u2019s love child??? I would\u2019ve put a stop to that as soon as I found this information out. If he wants to contribute to the 15 year old, then it should be just that. It should only pertain to the child. I am completely baffled by this. Granted your husband is a great guy for doing this, but y\u2019all got your own life to live. \n\nIf he wants to support the child from now on, I would write checks and document everything. The kids tuition, check to the private school. Needs clothes? Okay, I\u2019ll take you shopping, need a little carrying around money? Here\u2019s such and such. You get the picture. The ex wife is a real piece of work. Sadly the only person that suffers is the 15 year old, because her mother won\u2019t get off her dead ass and get a job. \n\n$4800 a month??? Jeez Louise OP\u2026..If your husband don\u2019t stop paying her, that\u2019s going to cause issues between y\u2019all. Definitely NTA", "NYA", "OP, I really feel for you because the ex has been taking advantage of the situation for a long time now, but your dh has been enabling her for just as long.  I appreciate that from your position, things needed to change yesterday, but how the change occurs is as important as the change itself. That's where I think YTA.\n\nYTA, not because the ex is entitled to 1 dime from dh or you but because the cutoff was so abrupt. His 15-year-old daughter is now living with an unhinged mother who can't pay for anything and doesn't have a job.  \n\nSo, buying his daughter personal things does not in fact support her if her mother suddenly has no means to provide a home for her. As the responsible parent, who has no legal rights as her father to gain custody (he should adopt her), he needs to continue to help his ex while she transitions to financial independence, so his daughter has a home.\n\nDh may have \"warned\" his ex about cutting her off, but he also knew she still wasn't working. There are plenty of legal and practical reasons to cut off the ex immediately, but his daughter still needs a home, and he has a moral obligation to provide one for her.", "YTA", "Yup", "NTA, but did you give her a couple of months' warning, at least? Yes, she should have been working,but your dh created this situation and  you suddenly cut all income. No one would be able to deal with that financially, I think you would have struggled, too. I would have given a couple months grace and then stopped - if they lose their home the 15 year old will be out in the street too.", "YTA\nThis girl thinks if your husband as her Dad and he\u2019s raised her as his. She wasn\u2019t a secret to you coming into the situation and you shouldn\u2019t have tried to change anything that pre existed you. This woman and that girl counted on him and he led them to believe they could count on him. He made an agreement and now isn\u2019t sticking to it.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
