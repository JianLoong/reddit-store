They are very masculine while I like to be very feminine. They can't help me with dresses, fashion choices, makeup, things like these. All that they talk about is sports and work (which is tech) while I'm here trying to talk about something completely else. Whenever I ask them a question about girls stuff, they are clueless about it and ask me to talk with one of my female friends about it. Okay but it's not enough.\n\nAnother thing is homophobia, it's not their fault but I have been bullied a lot in the past that I had to change schools a few times until we finally found a stable and tolerant one. That caused disturb in my life and wouldn't exist if they were just a traditional couple.\n\nOh and they were disowned both long ago by their parents so no grandparents for me! As if it wasn't enough having a normal life, now I can't even have grandparents like the other people, only uncles in my family.\n\nI don't know really but I find myself thinking that if they were a man and a woman, my life would have been way easier and better than this, I wonder how it feels to have an older same-sex woman in your life teaching you stuff, that would have been so cool.\n\nSo I told them all this and they weren't happy at all and a conflict ensued ending with me yelling that they don't understand me and crying to my room, when I woke up the next day, they started completely ignoring me and I feel like they are giving me the cold shoulder pretending like nothing happen. I asked them what's happening and they said that I have completely acted like a jerk dropping that on them yesterday, I don't know, I asked my friends and they all said that I'm the right one here morals-wise because they said that them having one father and one mother in their lives is the best kind of balance and it's natural that I want it too, so AITA?", "created_utc": 1680237349, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/127a8ey/aita_for_telling_my_parents_that_if_they_were_a/", "score": 57, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It couldn't have been. That's why I'm adopted. \n\nThere are hardships in every life. My dad got really, really super sick when I was your age. It messed up everything. Of course I wish I had healthy parents. (Who wouldn't?) \n\nIt is 100% valid to want someone to talk dresses and makeup and girly things with. It is valid not to want to be subject to other people's hate and bullying. It is valid to want grandparents (my dad's grandparents never accepted me as their granddaughter, either).

The desire to be normal isn't unusual, especially for teenagers.\n\nTry asking your dads if you can see a therapist.

It makes sense that you're having difficulty with it.\n\nNAH.

The world is designed for nuclear families - mum, dad, no more than two kids. \n\nBut by saying this to your dads, YTI. You basically said to them you didn\u2019t think that their love, and your family, is worth as much as a \u201cnormal\u201d family.

One could be a drinker, a gambler, a user, a narcissist, a cheater, an abuser.  You know this.  But do you know that having a mom wouldn't mean she knew anything about the things you liked?  I have worn a dress once in the last year, and makeup only that time.  I hate shopping.  And I am a cis female mom.  \n\nYou accomplished two things, making your dads feel bad and making yourself get your angst off your chest.  \n\nApologize and tell your dads what they can do to support you and move on.  \n\nVery soft YTA.", "I think everyone handled this incorrectly, yet based on your age, you less so. Your fathers shouldn't dismiss the underlying problem that you presented them. Do you have an aunt or older cousin you can speak to about women topics?", "NAH. It is hard for you and I'm sure it is hard for them also. I don't think it was good to tell them that your life would have been easy easier of you had a mom, but I understand where you are coming from. \n\nIf your parents can afford it, I'd suggest therapy to have someone to talk through these emotions with and find some solutions.", "YTA Because if your parent\u2019s provided you love and care that is them doing their job.\n\nHowever you are 14 which is a very difficult age and most teenagers will say something similar to their parents such as \u2018I didn\u2019t asked to be born\u2019 or \u2018why can\u2019t you be more like X\u2019s parents\u2019 - as all your hormones rage you tend to take it out on the people you most love and trust, in that case it\u2019s your parents, and you\u2019re probably doing this in a way you think is most hurtful to them.\n\nIf I was you I would sit them down and apologise, but say you are finding it really tough not having a female role model, so maybe you could get a counsellor or maybe hang out with one of their female relatives or close friends?

So I would try to rectify it as soon as you can - if you\u2019re finding it too hard maybe ask for family therapy.", "Yikes. ESH a little. The situation escalated into a fight, when some compassionate communication was really really needed here. That being said, families can have some major issues regardless of the sex of the parents.

If OP were an adult, I\u2019d go for YTA but I can\u2019t imagine a 14 year old who is being bullied can have the foresight to realize that the grass is not always greener on the other side.\n\nThe reason why I am around NTA and ESH is because of her parents reaction on ignoring her and not addressing her concerns in a productive manner.  I am sure it absolutely hurt them to hear but they are the parents and she is the child.  Given the context of the situation, I think OPs parents should have used this to address OPs concerns and discuss this fully without reacting poorly.  I am also teetering on NAH because I also feel no one can be an AH and it just a tough situation.", "NTA.  One thing that does stand out to me, is that the dads don\u2019t seem to have put much thought in to dealing with a 14 year old girl.  When she goes to them with a question, they tell her to speak to one of her female friends. With no other family available to Op, surely it must have been possible for the DADS to have a female friend be the go-to / fun aunt figure for her to help with navigating growing up without a female role figure.", "I\u2019m sorry, because a lot of your sadness about things you\u2019re missing out on is valid, but YTA. What you said was cruel and hurtful. They\u2019ve built a loving home for you, and lots of parents don\u2019t share their kids\u2019 interests. It\u2019s not just about gender.\n\nI was tempted to say no AH here because you are a teenager feeling normal parental resentment, but as a parent who\u2019s dealt with homophobia and done your best to raise a child, having your child throw back resentment about being in a same-sex household at you must be incredibly hurtful. You\u2019re old enough to realize how that could be cruel.\n\nThere are things your dads could do better, no doubt, like being more proactive about helping you have older women in your life. That\u2019s something two married friends of mine who are gay men want to be intentional about if they have children, especially if they ever have a daughter. And maybe they could work harder to connect with your interest. But you can not fairly criticize them for not having the right \u201cbalance\u201d because they\u2019re two men or homophobia they\u2019ve faced, and I\u2019m kind of horrified your friends are playing into that by celebrating having straight parents.", "INFO\n\nWhat was your intent in telling them?", "Your words were hurtful and inconsiderate.\n\nBut, that said: there's nothing wrong with wishing you had a mom. There's nothing wrong with feeling a hole in your life because you haven't got a mom or a cool aunt or a grandma or an older sister or a woman who's part of your parents' chosen family playing one of those roles in a long term way in your life.\n\nOn top of that, many people who were adopted feel some pain about not having whatever family they originally came from. And that pain is legitimate even if you have the most amazing adoptive parents in the world and love them with all your heart.\n\nIf there's any way for you to see a counselor about these feelings, I really hope that you can. \n\nHugs to you from a mom of a different 14yo girl. \n\nNAH", "NTA. Listen, you're young and you have a lot of feelings. That's okay. I think you hurt their feelings by telling them you wish you had a traditional parental arrangement. Instead, consider telling them you wish there was a maternal figure in your life (not your friends) who you could connect with. Let them know you would like to connect with an aunt/grandma/female family friend/ etc, for female support.", "I really hate saying this, and I'm not trying to dismiss your hardships, but YTA.\n\nI have a mom and a dad, and let me tell you. My mom know NOTHING about makeup. Everything I learned is from friends and YouTube tutorials. Whenever my mom wants to put makeup (for weddings, for example), I'm the one who help her.\n\nI also love anime and my mom and dad (and the rest of my family) aren't interested in that, so I can't talk with them about that without them getting bored.\n\nA lot of people, especially in this sub, go NC with their parents for a lot of different reasons, so their children don't have grandparents too.\n\nAgain, not to dismiss your hardships, but bullies will bully people because they can, they're not looking for a specific reason.\n\nYour dads also have to deal with homophobia and with their family disowning them. I bet it hurt a lot more when the child they poured their love and care into for the last 14 years is telling them stuff like that.", "You're 14, so I'm partial to be a bit more lenient here.\n\nBeing straight doesn't stop you from having a bad relationship with your parents. Straight couples cut off their parents all the time for other problems. Moms are not always feminine. Dads are not always masculine. Bullies will bully for whatever reason they can find, doesn't matter.\n\nI can understand where you're coming from, but thinking that things would be better if xyz and *saying* that, are two different things. Unfortunately here YTA. I think you should try and sit down with your parents and try and talk about the issues you're having - as a family.", "So... is important to share your feelings, but there's nothing to be resolved here. Unless you say to them specific things you feel like you're missing out on and ask for more support, what are they supposed to do? Become straight? Turn back time to not adopt you? When you don't have solutions to big problems like this (and aren't speaking as if you're looking to find any) sharing these things kinda makes you an AH because the only purpose it serves is to hurt. \n\nNow, if you feel your dad's are not providing you with everything you need for support,  even after speaking to them,  that's a different story. But for now, I'm still going YTA because it has nothing to do with the fact that you have two dads and you are making a very hurtful and ignorant statement.", "NTA.  But it's not about being right or wrong in this case.  It's about trying to express your feelings in a productive way with people who care about you.  At 14, trust me, your dads should understand that you might not always hit the nail on the head in that regard.  I don't think anyone on reddit could have that conversation at 14 without it going a little sideways, and we'd probably say stuff in ways that made people feel badly.  That's just how it goes.  I would really hope that they understand that and will let you open up about your feelings.  I'm more than confident they would want you to talk to them.\n\nLife can be unfair.  My biological father wasn't around when I was a kid.  He did some terrible stuff to my mother to torment her, smashed up her car so she couldn't get to work, all sorts of stuff.  It's okay to feel like you're missing out on something.  Because you are.  But you're not alone.  My bet is your dads were probably taken a little off-guard, but that they would really want to help you navigate your feelings.  Give them a chance.", "I\u2019m sorry that you are hurting. You have clearly had a lot of pain in your life. It\u2019s easy to think that if this one thing was different then there wouldn\u2019t be so much pain. Unfortunately, not all moms do girly things (mine sure didn\u2019t), kids will find any reason to bully (the kids in my school sure did), grandparents aren\u2019t around for all kids, even if they do exist (I saw mine a couple of times a year), and people will find reasons to discriminate against you even if your parents aren\u2019t gay (teen mom, poverty in my family\u2019s case). It absolutely sucks that you have had the challenges you\u2019ve had, and I understand being angry and wishing things were different. Please try to remember that it hasn\u2019t been all bad and your parents have genuinely done the best they can for you. Maybe they could use a little reminder that they should get up to speed on the girl stuff since they are raising a young person who is growing into a woman, and she needs to be able to turn to them even for those things.", "My son has a number of mums. He is 33 now.  He fid want to meet his done st your age as he was trying to work out his identity.  He says now he doesn't really miss a man in his life. But your feelings are valid.

Talk to them .", "I had a mom and I still couldn't ask her anything. Do I feel like I missed out in much needed feminine attention and advice?? Yes certainly. My mom wasn't capable of it. So while I understand the loss and frustration you feel, it's not necessarily better with a traditional mom and dad.  \nBoth my grandmas died when I was very young and I only had two grandpas left. They were both great but again I do feel like I missed out. \n\nYou can spend your life being upset at what life hasn't given you, but in the end it's pointless to do that.

I'm sorry there are no real men and women in your life. Especially now that your in your teens. Keep your head high. Don't let ppl bring you down.

It\u2019s normal for adoptees to wonder about ways their lives could\u2019ve turned out and it\u2019s normal to wish you had a mom if you don\u2019t have one. HOWEVER, it might be best for you to explain that you love them and are so glad they\u2019re your parents and you wouldn\u2019t want other parents, but you wish you had a female figure in your life to bond with and to talk about certain things with. That will make more sense to them. This is a tough situation. Sorry you\u2019re going through it.", "The fact they are given you the cold shoulder to a child such as yourself says a lot.

Lest we forgot middle school sucks for everyone and especially girls as cliques are forming and are brutal. OP even mentions that she\u2019s been bullied at school before bc she has 2 dads. A lot of what she\u2019s feeling (and possibly her delivery) is hormones but a lot is also due to middle school social pressures, lack of extended family, and a feeling of being isolated even at home due to a complete lack of female influence to do girly stuff with. She\u2019s telling her dads what she\u2019s going through and what she needs, and they blew her off and let their egos keep them from hearing her. (Reacting is not the same a really listening and hearing.) OP suggest trying to talk to them again.  Maybe in therapy if you have that option. ? Do they have any female friends that could be someone to do stuff with. Usually, I\u2019d suggest an aunt or cousin, but that doesn\u2019t seem possible here. I hope you are heard and find someone who can be that strong female role model you need.", "Sweet girl, being a teenager is *hard*.  Peers are mean, new challenges seem to pop up every day, and hormones are raging.  Add adoption and a non-nuclear family on top, it can feel like the whole world is against you and it's so easy to get lost in \"what if...\"\n\nYou're not wrong for craving a female role model or for wanting your dads to help provide one for you.  Good options would be asking about their friends or looking into big sister programs.  Having a mom wouldn't guarantee the lessons you want or shared interests.  It's also natural to vent your frustrations at the safest people in your life (ie your dads), but that doesn't fully absolve you of the hurt you've caused them.\n\nHomophobia is ugly and I'm sorry you had to change schools.  But you're right... *It isn't your dads' fault*.\n\nI'm sure it feels extra hurtful to have your dads shut down after you vented to them.

Stepping back and giving space while they process is much better than escalating, even if it doesn't feel good in the moment.\n\nUnfortunately, YTA, but I say this with love.

My mother never taught me the feminine stuff. My friends mom took me to get my hair done for my first date, mine was unavailable to help. I had grandparents growing up and the only good one died when I was 3. The rest favored their other grandkids for one reason or another. I'm almost 45 and let me tell you the grass is NOT greener on the other side.

Your dads probably need to work on educating themselves about women's issues, and take a little more interest in the things that you like to do and wear and all that, but you have GOT to understand that things like homophobia aren't their fault, and anyone that touts \"a father AND a mother\" nonsense doesn't know what they're talking about. Morals-wise, that's just ... I mean that's yikes. You saying you're morally right because you have two dads and not a mom and a dad, it's just ... like I can't even figure out how to form the words. It's kind of homophobic. Your dads didn't choose to be gay, or choose to be disowned. And plenty of kids don't have grandparents either.

My father was completely emotionally negligent. The only times he acknowledged my sister or I was to yell at us for making noise and reminding him we existed. My mother hit my sister and I. She even hit me in front of my friends once.

One friend grew up with a father who hurt his back and got addicted to pain pills and a mother who tried overcompensating for this by doting to make up for dad's verbal abuse. Another friend was trans in a religious family with hoarder parents who constantly misgendered him and, at best, ignored the fact that he was trans. Another friend had completely checked out parents who, instead of doing any parenting, fed her junk food to buy her love; when she was in college, her mom got very, very sick (died a few years later) and her dad responded by openly cheating in front of her. Another friend grew up in extreme abuse to the point where her mother couldn't deal with anything (at 14, she was finally diagnosed with chiari and dropped out of high school due to being constantly ill and in pain, and the day of her diagnosis, her mom shrugged, left her on the couch, and just never spoke about it again) to the point where she had to marry at 18 in order to flee from her father who was attempting to get her involuntarily admitted to a psychiatric hospital to avoid losing control of her before her birthday.

They are very masculine while I like to be very feminine. They can't help me with dresses, fashion choices, makeup, things like these. All that they talk about is sports and work (which is tech) while I'm here trying to talk about something completely else. Whenever I ask them a question about girls stuff, they are clueless about it and ask me to talk with one of my female friends about it. Okay but it's not enough.\n\nAnother thing is homophobia, it's not their fault but I have been bullied a lot in the past that I had to change schools a few times until we finally found a stable and tolerant one. That caused disturb in my life and wouldn't exist if they were just a traditional couple.\n\nI don't know really but I find myself thinking that if they were a man and a woman, my life would have been way easier and better than this, I wonder how it feels to have an older same-sex woman in your life teaching you stuff, that would have been so cool.\n\nSo I told them all this and they weren't happy at all and a conflict ensued ending with me yelling that they don't understand me and crying to my room, when I woke up the next day, they started completely ignoring me and I feel like they are giving me the cold shoulder pretending like nothing happen. I asked them what's happening and they said that I have completely acted like a jerk dropping that on them yesterday, I don't know, I asked my friends and they all said that I'm the right one here morals-wise because they said that them having one father and one mother in their lives is the best kind of balance and it's natural that I want it too, so AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

The comments section here is going with the 'worst of all possible worlds' idea when the reality is not everyone is horrible.

But you need to try to do it in a more 'I miss this' rather than 'this is all your fault' attitude. \n\nApologise to your dads.
