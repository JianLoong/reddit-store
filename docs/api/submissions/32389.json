She had not wanted me to attend the wedding & made that clear. It was a rather grand affair, but only those who were close to her had attended. She said that as I am \"not related to her\", I should not attend.\n\nMy parents asked me to understand by saying that it's her wedding, etc. I did not protest & did not attend. However, I also have not properly talked to her for a year now. She sent me her wedding photos, but I did not respond to her.\n\nShe also informed that she's pregnant, and I just said congratulations & ended the call. Now, I did not hear back from her again until she gave birth  to her daughter, who is my niece. They called me to inform, and I just said congrats.\n\nThey asked me whether I am not going to attend & buy my niece expensive gifts, and I said \"You did not want me at your wedding. I don't want to anything to do with your marriage and whatever results out of it.\" They did not take that well and began to yell at me, accusing me of being a terrible uncle and all that, for not even seeing her.\n\nBut I just asked them to fuck off & have not seen my niece.

They should have shut that bs down when their daughter started it. \n\nInstead as usual the people not being ostracized make a zillion excuses and say you should forgive them because they are \u2018family\u2019. \n\nThe best bad reason is people saying that by them reaching out to you (for expensive gifts) they are trying to establish a relationship.

How come she chose to not invite to wedding, but for giving gifts for birth is okay? And they want you around the new baby? Would they even let you hold baby?

However, I was adopted & she's always maintained a certain distance towards me. She has not ill-treated me, but she doesn't consider me family. She had not wanted me to attend the wedding & made that clear. It was a rather grand affair, but only those who were close to her had attended. She said that as I am \"not related to her\", I should not attend.\n\nMy parents asked me to understand by saying that it's her wedding, etc. I did not protest & did not attend. However, I also have not properly talked to her for a year now. She sent me her wedding photos, but I did not respond to her.\n\nShe also informed that she's pregnant, and I just said congratulations & ended the call. Now, I did not hear back from her again until she gave birth  to her daughter, who is my niece. They called me to inform, and I just said congrats.\n\nThey asked me whether I am not going to attend & buy my niece expensive gifts, and I said \"You did not want me at your wedding. I don't want to anything to do with your marriage and whatever results out of it.\" They did not take that well and began to yell at me, accusing me of being a terrible uncle and all that, for not even seeing her.\n\nBut I just asked them to fuck off & have not seen my niece. My parents and friends are saying that I did the wrong thing and that I should go see them, etc.\n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

That little girl will miss nothing from him not being in her life she doesnt even know he exists and thats unlikely to change because he does not have a relationship with her parents.
