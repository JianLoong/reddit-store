No nurse should be speaking to a patient like that.", "NTA\n\nThat nurse shouldn't be working with birthing mothers.", "This nurse was exactly like the monsters who gave my mum PTSD by mistreating her during and after her birthing me. There\u2019s a notion that you stop being a real person once you become a mum because you\u2019ve essentially passed your personhood on to your kid- you yourself don\u2019t matter at all anymore. It\u2019s dangerous misogyny and I\u2019d never feel safe with a nurse like that. I hope she gets fired.", "NTA, I got the ick from reading \"It's over, it's not about you anymore.\" damnnn what kind of monster does that?? \n\nNah this nurse should be far away from helping people and your wife is too much of a people pleaser.\n\nI think you should complain about her at the hospital", "NTA, I would write a complaint to the hospital board about this incident. It shouldn\u2019t be fireable (unless this nurse already has other complaints) but the hospital should be able to prevent this in the future", "NTA. I think the nurse forgot that it\u2019s not about *her*. It absolutely is about both mother and baby. Even after birth. \n\nConsidering my experiences with nurses, I wouldn\u2019t be shocked if the nurse was faking it so you didn\u2019t go to the hospital, which you absolutely should do btw. If she treated your wife this way in front of you, how is she treating patients when no one is watching?", "NTA. You should report that nurse.", "NTA \n\nIt definitely was still \u201cabout\u201d your wife. The nurse\u2019s role is to continue monitoring her after the delivery, the risks to her is not over yet. And to develop a supportive relationship with her to allow any teaching or other intervention that could be needed. The mother is still her patient. This is a scary way to talk to your patient. \n\nif your comments were stated calmly and worded tactfully as you describe, good job. It must have taken some self control to be that restrained.  You were advocating for the patient when she is in a vulnerable period - what a nurse should do.", "NTA\n\nFunny how quickly a spouse comes on line when the other is hurt and not getting the attention you feel then need, regardless if they need it or not.\n\nOne thing about medical professionals, sometimes they have bad days, but whats worse is when they get complacent with their jobs and forget they are dealing with people.", "NTA. I don\u2019t actually think you were rude, whereas the nurse was horribly rude. She is in the wrong line of work if she thinks what she said was appropriate. You stood up for your wife and you should be proud of yourself.", "NTA I kicked a nurse out for having an attitude and requested a different one. I'd just had a baby and Idc what was going on in her life at that time to have a crappy attitude but I wasn't about to deal with it ... 24hrs of labour followed by emergency c-section... get your attitude out of my room!! You did the right thing.", "NTA her comment maybe came out different that what she intended, but it sure sounds very insensitive.", "NTA. The nurse was unprofessional.", "NTA  \nQuestion: She saw the baby, wanted to hold her and was upset/anxious.  They don't immeditately pass the baby to the mother where you live??   \nThat's really awful and cruel! The only time babies are not put directly into their mothers arms at birth is if there is a problem with mother or child here.", "NTA\n\n\nYou advocated for your wife when she was struggling and not being supported by medical staff. I get it must be challenging to be a nurse, but fuck me, there's better ways to calm a mum down. And the whole \"it's not about you anymore\" line made me rage. Women's maternity healthcare needs don't end at birth.\n\n\nYes you were strong and direct, and it may have upset her but you reacted appropriately given the circumstances.\n\n\nI'd flag this to a more senior member of staff. Hopefully they can feedback/coach the nurse to respond more constructively with other patients.", "Oh, NTA and as a nurse myself it breaks my heart that you and your family were treated this way. We all have bad days, I\u2019ve had them too, but that should never effect how we as nurses treat our patients. If you have the energy I recommend that you take this to the clinical coordinator or the boss of the unit. You are allowed to request another nurse, they might not be able to assign someone else but you can always ask. \nOh and also Congratulations on your new baby \ud83d\udc97", "NTA she had it coming", "NTA.  I'm not sure if the nurse was totally out of line as there may have been a lot going on but either way she was being insensitive. \n\nIt doesn't sound like you were being super harsh or aggressive but you were standing up for your wife and giving the nurse feedback she should consider. \n\nMaybe a tact to take with your wife is to explain that the nurse maybe wasn't thinking but needed to realize there were two patients in the room one of whom could hear and understand her and that ir was worth the nurse thinking about her comments because if she said it to your wife she's very likely to say similar to others too.  She needs to understand her bedside manner needs work or multiple patients are going to have an unnecessarily bad experience.", "NTA.  Some people need to reinstall the filter between their brain and their mouth.", "Gentle yta. Completely understandable response given the circumstances, but that doesn't make it OK.\nBeing rude to people who are rude doesn't show people who are rude that being rude is wrong. \nYou're right that she should have been more compassionate, and could have reassured your wife in what was obviously a stressful time for you both, and is her day-to-day, and you'd have absolutely had the moral high ground if you'd found a way to say that without stooping to her level.", "I know this will get downvoted but holy fuck people need to learn to take a deep breath sometimes.  Nurse was unprofessional in how she said it\u2026but she was right.", "ESH. Her comment was out of line and it was ok to say something. But it was not ok to keep going at her. When she told you that she would get you on the way that was basically a peace offering. Instead you insult her to the core of her professional being. That\u2019s just rude over one comment. You emphasize how much you are on edge. You can be 100% sure that she\u2019s more on edge\u2026.", "NTA but...Remember: Anyone can be having a bad day. Maybe the nurse got some bad news, or had a bad night, something maybe happened and it's hard not to bring it to work sometimes. You said what you said, you apologized for it. Believe me: I work in a hospital....It is nothing new. But, that said, you are patients AND customers! You are paying for the facility's services and deserve to be treated courteously and with a basic level of respect. If you do not feel you received that, you can always go to Administration and officially complain. They do not like hearing bad things about their staff, and they will investigate.", "[removed]", "Need more info. Was your wife ok? If she was having trouble talking and breathing then did that get adequate evaluation?\n\nToo many women get ignored after birth and have medical problems and even death as a result.\n\nI\u2019m inclined to go with ESH.  Nursing is not easy but never ever ignore a post partum mother in any sort of distress.  \n\nOP: You aren\u2019t nurse manager so it was a little out of pocket to say what you did.", "YTA", "NTA. She sees it everyday, you don\u2019t. I\u2019m sure she\u2019s heard worse.

But your wife went through serious trauma and that was a seriously unkind thing to say to her. \u201cIt\u2019s not about you anymore\u201d is a messed up.

There's a whole list of aftercare needs that someone who's just gone through labour needs, including watching out for infection, blood pressure, prolapses, blood clots (such as DVT), her wheezing could have been due to a blood clot!

I think she was having a panic attack. In her own words, she said she saw the baby, wanted to hold her, and didn't have much more complex thought than that.

The risk from infection and blood clots etc happens during and immediately after, she still needs *vigilant* care.\n\nLike I said, the wheezing could have been due to a blood clots.
