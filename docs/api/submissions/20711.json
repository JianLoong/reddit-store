It ISN'T all about the baby.", "A mom does not have to snap out of it, and the nurse's reaction served no positive purpose.  That's an unacceptable way to speak to anyone. That wasn't firm, it was rude.", "She probably already was focussed on the baby which is why she panicked upon seeing it being taken away. I don\u2019t think she was being self absorbed", ">Ain\u2019t no body going to be naming their baby after this nurse I\u2019ll tell you what.\n\nWhat do you mean? Ratched is a lovely name", "> highest maternal mortality rates\n\nAgreed. The US's [maternal mortality rate](https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/field/maternal-mortality-ratio/country-comparison) is *twice* that of Canada and the UK, and *four times* greater than Germany and Sweden. It's ridiculous. And [preventable](https://www.propublica.org/article/die-in-childbirth-maternal-death-rate-health-care-system-1). Our rates *should* be comparable with the rest of the developed world, and it's not. And that nurse's attitudes and *lack of training* are causes. OP's wife's symptoms should've caused *more* notice and care from the nurse, not less! Frankly-- at this point **I'm not mad at the nurse anymore-- I'm angry at the culture that the nurse represents, and the (lack of) training provided to her and others on maternal post-partum mortality. There needs to be change at the hospital level.** \n\nY'all should learn more here:   \nhttps://www.propublica.org/series/lost-mothers/", "I am not intending to make light of your sister's trauma, she surely suffered probably the worst feeling in the world but I imagine that if he had to spend time in the NICU for his condition, giving your sister an in-depth explanation on what's wrong with her son might not be higher priority than getting the baby to the NICU. \n\nI doubt her entire mission for becoming a nurse was to hurt people. I imagine that you don't take extra classes to be a midwife just because you want to make women suffer. If you wanted that just becoming the representative for a health insurance company.\n\nI have to imagine that she became a neonatal nurse to help babies, and at that moment, she was trying to help the baby who you admitted was bad enough to need the NICU. Easily treatable does not necessarily mean that time is plentiful. But I don't know the details, so I can only speculate. \n\nShe still probably should've made sure someone got back to the mom and explained it once baby was safe.", "I\u2019m not a medical professional - I worked as support staff in a veterinary hospital for over a decade and it\u2019s made me a bit of a biology/medicine geek, but by no means a professional.  But I know that OP\u2019s wife\u2019s was at elevated risk for eclampsia, embolism, or stroke, due to being immediately postpartum.   Unusual behavior and difficulty speaking should have been ringing alarm bells in that nurse\u2019s head.  Sending her home without further observation/examination could have been a deadly mistake.  Hell, it still could be, I hope OP and wife are keeping a close eye on her recovery and not just the baby.", "And you\u2019d be the first in line crying when there was no one to take care of you or you\u2019re loved one. \n\nThere\u2019s a reason why there\u2019s already a nurse shortage. They\u2019re sick of being punching bags.\n\nYes, what she said was wrong. And good for OP for saying it was not alright she did that. \n\nBut after her oh ok, OP should\u2019ve dropped it and for THAT he is in the wrong. He was on edge, overly emotional and treated her like a punching bag. There is a difference between standing up and just being an ass. Which OP crossed over the asshole line.", "Like I said, *everyone* sucks here.", "Lmao so OP telling someone they\u2019re shit at their life\u2019s work, after she just helped bring his child into the world, is definitely an emotionally regulated comment right?\n\nAnyone who is downvoting me please reply with an honest answer to my question - did OP make an emotionally regulated comment or not?", "It partially is. I work in medical. Many are sick and tired of being punching bags to patients. \n\nDon\u2019t take the blame off of where it is partially due. Yes, stress is always there, but you wouldn\u2019t like people treating you like an asshole when you didn\u2019t do anything wrong and you\u2019d quit too. Hence the shortages.", "What about this post says the person can't be a nurse? Is being bubbly and effusive the most important part of the job? Or is it getting other people's piss, shit, and blood on you, while they may or may not die, and still coming back while working back-to-back 12-hour shifts, the most important part?", "You got one side of the story and even then OP feels bad, his wife said it was wrong..... But yeah just abuse Nurses when they won't let you hold your baby when you are in no for state too, have a tantrum on the ward and take it personally when you get told to calm down. You like OP knows better than the professionals.....", "Where did I say the nurse\u2018s comment was ok? Maybe you should read my judgement again\u2026. there have been plenty of studies showing how stressed nurses are\u2026 also if you a job where everybody treats you like crap you sometimes snap at the wrong person. Doesn\u2019t make it alright but still makes it an AH move to tell her she\u2019s a bad nurse all together.", "No I\u2019m not.\n\n I stated what she did was not ok. And that OP should\u2019ve stood up for his wife.  But OP was out of line after she said \u201coh ok\u201d. He should\u2019ve let it go and then he can report her and get a different nurse.\n\nI feel like OP is leaving a lot out of his story here.", "Sorry to ruin your day but that's literally not part of their job description. A nurse is not a waitress. They can provide their services and just remain silent for all that matters. It's not their job to be your mental coach.", "Get your sh*t out fo here with the calling bs to justify teachers and nurses low wages. Suck it up cause here's the reality. People are just doing a job to provide a service for their worth and time in order to put food on the table for their family and kids. Sorry to ruin your world view with pink lenses but that's simply not how it works. No one owes you mental support if it's not part of their job. You gonna tip them for better services now ?", "You\u2019re NTA. \nImagine if god forbid you couldn\u2019t make it to the delivery room and your wife had to give birth alone, she would\u2019ve been having a break down RIGHT AFTER BIRTH while a nurse berated\n her, and she would\u2019ve had no one by her side to defend her. That would\u2019ve been horrifying. \n\nThe Nurse had no right to be cruel at all. A part of being in the healthcare industry is compassion and she\u2019s clearly lacking that.", "He'll no!! Girl, I hope your husband told him to screw off.", "That\u2019s the exact impression that I got! I hope OP makes a complaint to the hospital. Too many people don\u2019t say anything to avoid conflicts.", "The removal of personhood from a mother is one of the key reasons I don't want to be a parent. I have no desire for most of the child raising process but to lose myself to parenthood is my worst nightmare.", "Being treated like I didn't matter anymore after a traumatic delivery left me with serious mental health issues. Wife might feel uncomfortable now, but when she thinks back she'll remember her husband sticking up for her. It'll give her strength.\n\nOP is NTA.", "I agree 100%. My hope is that the nurse's words were not with ill intention and was a shortsighted statement meant to impress the impact of motherhood... something akin to reassuring her that the baby is here and her life is no longer \"all about her\"\n\nRegardless, this nurse should be more cognizant of how her words can be interpreted and work to be more empathetic towards the people in her care.", "Which is equally wrong. Mum is still at risk of a number of post-natal complications, especially after a messy, complicated deliverty.\n\nWhat the nurse could easily have said is \"let me help you, here's your baby, see, they're fine, just breathe and see if you can relax a bit. Are you okay for me to check the baby over now while your husband sits here, or he can come with me; I'll just be a couple of minutes, I need to do X and Y?\"", "Exactly, it's not what you say (usually), it's how you say it.", "Patient advocates are lawsuit shields.

There's a reason maternal mortality is so unnecessarily high.", "Obstetrical violence is very real, and too large of a topic to get into here. \n\nI'll just say that Western medicine models are very happy to treat women as non-persons when they're pregnant, birthing, or postpartum. Whether it's starting a procedure without obtaining consent or verbally denigrating the mother for all sorts of reasons, it's all too common.", "Gladly. It\u2019s not. Birth can be incredibly traumatic for women.", "I agree, and maybe the nurse is but OP is not perceiving it that way.", "Are you a labor and delivery nurse?", "Also, the most common time for a mother to die is not *during* the birth, but in the first days and weeks *after* the birth.

He didn\u2019t even go into the NICU until the following day", "Nobody said she had to be bubbly, but she was only doing 50% of her job in looking out for the baby and not the mum.

I want to help people manage those feelings because we too often ignore that loss of self that comes with motherhood.", ">something akin to reassuring her that the baby is here and her life is no longer \"all about her\"\n\nHow is this any better? What nurse has the right to tell you that life is no longer about you? That is completely inappropriate statement in this situation. (in MOST situations) It's not her place in any way, shape or form. It is not her job to impress upon her patient the impact of motherhood.", "Yup. This attitude is why the U.S. has such a high maternal mortality rate compared to other developed countries. \u201cIt\u2019s not about you anymore\u201d while mom sits there and bleeds out.", "I think that\u2019s far too situational and none of us were there. OP can make the distinction of that was appropriate or not. But at a minimum, the nurse could have used better language.", "A lot of people don't know what that is, but they should.  It can make or break the success of a hospital (or department) if the low scores keep showing up.", "Oh yes absolutely. And even worse for women of colour (see the Serena Williams case..)", "It doesn't matter if I am or not.  A nurse has to walk that fine line of performing a medical function and serving a patient's other needs.  That's why nurses are so important.  If a patient says you're rude, then you're rude.  I think common sense says that it isn't all about the baby.  That's why post partum health is an important topic in MODERN medicine. Snapping at your patient to snap out of it doesn't work.  It doesn't work in any facet of life.", "Yeah in the UK you get frequent home visits from the Midwife until baby is 10 days old, then you get assigned a health visitor until they are 5 that visits to check on you.  I lost a litre of blood so got to stay in 3 nights, and they did say they have first time mums in for 1 night, but it is pretty crazy that you get this little thing then suddenly you're on your own.", "For me it was 24 hours. Not all hospital are the same in the us", "There's no indication the mother was in physical danger, just that she was having an emotional reaction. I hope the next time me or a loved one's life is on the line I get a no-nonsense nurse who's good at their job instead of wanting to essentially complain to the manager that they weren't nice enough.", "Exactly. Women are ignored in medical settings to the point that they DIE.

I don't take OPs story as the whole truth. He's clearly infusing his own bias into the narrative, so we simply can't say if this is exactly how it went or not.\n\nAdditionally, patients will call you rude for a lot of things. Say I order q6 labs on a patient, im rude because they get woken up (who cares if I need the data to make sure they aren't decompensating?), im rude for not writing for more opioids, im rude for not allowing them to eat (who cares if I'm worried about an aspiration event?), im rude for showing up at work with my face.

Nurses are underpaid and overworked, and yet they're the ones that do 90% of the work to keep people alive. I'd love it if they were paid enough and rested enough to be nice and sunny to every single person, but they're not, and the fella in this story thinks they're entitled to special treatment that NO ONE gets because that's not the childish fantasy world we live in where service workers are grinning slaves. Grow up.", "Just pointing it out because your comment came across like a blanket statement. I've lived through a time when newly delivered mothers & babies were regularly sent home within in a few hours as a matter of policy. That resulted in a big uptick in negative and even fatal outcomes because of hemorrhaging and other problems which were not caught before release to home.  24 hr stay for observation has greatly reduced those outcomes. For those who have an apparently smooth delivery with no complications,  it still provides rest and recovery.", "You\u2019re not expected to be a grinning slave, but I think telling a patient they don\u2019t matter is a shit move.
