The mother is left to fend for herself and recover alone (unless its something serious), you only get councelling for traumatic birth depending on your physical injuries. \n\nI always wonder how much money a newborn (aka new taxpayer) is worth? How much money does one bring in on average to a country? I would love to see that number up against how much money we spend on the women who give birth. \n\nPersonally i think every mother should get 30k per child. If men gave birth they would never be treated the way women are.", "I\u2019m so sorry your mum went through that. It\u2019s sadly more common that anyone would wish. Midwives and other medical staff said much the same to me, repeatedly saying I should \u2018just be grateful the baby is healthy\u2019 when I was begging for help with my own injuries. I was told so often that it didn\u2019t matter that I couldn\u2019t walk properly or even lift my own baby without pain that when I got PPP it manifested as thinking I\u2019d died.

The US has one of the highest maternal mortality rates. I had a super quick and easy delivery. Afterwards, the doctors asked me my pain level, and I said zero. They still spent the next day and a half checking on my oxegyn, blood pressure, heart rate, pain, and everything else. Of course they took care of the baby, but I was still their patient too, and I had just gone through a major medical event. \n\nThe fact that OP's wife was hysterical and *couldn't breath* and the nurse ignored and insulted her, is unacceptable.

I did the same. She didn\u2019t necessarily have an nasty attitude, but she wasn\u2019t taking my concerns seriously when I told her the epidural wasn\u2019t working correctly and I was feeling back labor on one side. Just repeatedly told me it was normal. \n\nMoral of the story: a shitty nurse can really change the dynamic of the entire room, in a best case scenario.", "My sister had a horrific experience with a nurse too. The day after giving birth a nurse came up, grabbed the baby and said \u2018the doctor has concerns, were taking the baby\u2019 and walked away. My sister had had an emergency c section and couldn\u2019t stand, just had to watch her walk off with her child. Her MIL was there and ran after the nurse asking her what the hell was going on and she needed more info, where was the baby going, when would he be back, the nurse said \u2018I gave you all the info you need\u2019 and left with her baby.
