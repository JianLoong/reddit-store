My (25F) boyfriend (26M) has a doctors appointment at 9 in the morning. He asked me to give him a call to make sure he wakes up on time and doesn\u2019t miss it. I told him I might not be able to because I\u2019ll be in the car all day as I\u2019m driving back home (12 hour drive) with my dad. He then continues to ask me if I could please wake him up as this is an important appointment. I finally said that I\u2019d give him one call at 8AM. He then asked if I could also call him 30 minutes later to make sure he\u2019s truly awake. I said I didn\u2019t want to do that and he asked if I could then text his mom to make sure he wakes up on time. After saying no a bunch of times he gets extremely pissed off at me. I don\u2019t want to continuously be calling him with my dad in the car. I also feel like he just expects me to do this and doesn\u2019t appreciate it.\n\nInfo: He sleeps through his alarm quite often and has a hard time waking up.\n\nInfo: Just to add, he said he would text his mom the night before but he wants me to text her the morning to just to make sure", "created_utc": 1683949671, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13g6blu/aita_for_not_calling_my_boyfriend_in_the_morning/", "score": 36, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I mean really, it\u2019s bad enough he badgered you to wake him, but then he asked you to text his mother to ask a favor for him?  Is he not capable of texting her himself?", "ppl who can't wake up on their own really irk me. how is it that he can hear you calling him, but not his alarm going off? the noise is probably coming from the SAME device! \n\nthis sounds like a power play. he knows you don't want to do it, so he's going to guilt you into doing it, so he knows you won't let him down in the future. im glad you didnt back down. he's supposed to be a grown up. don't become his nanny, without pay.", "NTA - Your boyfriend is 26 and he hasn't figured out how to wake himself up yet?", "NTA - also, you're not his mommy.", "Info: are you sure you\u2019re ready to raise a man child?

If he can't even be responsible enough to get out of bed during the 8am call and not snooze, he is simply refusing to do anything for himself and expects you to do everything.

He should get those alarm clock that run away from you and you need to get up to shut it off. This is his issue not yours. Also, it is dangerous to use your phone while driving. \n\nInfo: is this the only thing that he expects you to take responsibility for, even though he is a grown adult, or is this a common thing?
