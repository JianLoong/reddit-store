He then continues to ask me if I could please wake him up as this is an important appointment. I finally said that I\u2019d give him one call at 8AM. He then asked if I could also call him 30 minutes later to make sure he\u2019s truly awake. I said I didn\u2019t want to do that and he asked if I could then text his mom to make sure he wakes up on time. After saying no a bunch of times he gets extremely pissed off at me. I don\u2019t want to continuously be calling him with my dad in the car. I also feel like he just expects me to do this and doesn\u2019t appreciate it.\n\nInfo: He sleeps through his alarm quite often and has a hard time waking up.\n\nInfo: Just to add, he said he would text his mom the night before but he wants me to text her in the morning just to make sure\n\nEdit: I forgot to mention that I usually always give him a few wake up calls and I don\u2019t mind. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a bad thing to call him and wake him up when I have the time and am in the right environment.

Are you embarrassed that your bf can't wake up by himself and also needs you to coordinate with his mom to make sure he wakes up? Do you want to be responsible for doing this for him when you're not there to physically shake him awake? What would he do if you weren't available, rely on his mom? NTA but think about your future.", "Seconding this. Half asleep me is someone I don\u2019t even recognise. It\u2019s like I have no filter or awareness of peoples feelings.", "Not the person you asked, but Alarmy has this. It\u2019s an evil phone alarm app that has a variety of awful sirens to wake you up and you can also set tasks like math problems or taking a picture of something specific. I hate it, but it works!", "Oh absolutely. Waking up was always my responsibility. I would occasionally ask someone to call me if I had something like an appointment or if I thought I would have a particularly rough time the next morning as backup, but if they couldn't, they couldn't. I wouldn't try to argue with them about it.", "I never thought of it that way. \n\nI guess because the difficulty waking up wasn't one of the  reasons I sought out the diagnosis. I didn't evem realize it was related until I tried a medication that didn't work for me and started sleeping through my alarms again. I sympathize with OP's boyfriend for having trouble waking up, because I know how much it sucks to have that be a constant aource of stress and worry. I *do not* sympathize with his lack of personal responsibility.", "Well, yeah, but I still manage to get up on time(ish). I don\u2019t expect my partner to be my alarm clock/wake up call.", "NTA but maybe stop enabling him. It\u2019s nice that you don\u2019t mind doing it but he\u2019s a 26 year old man not a 10 year old child. He needs to grow up and figure out how to get up like an adult.", "Tell him to get the sleep cycle app. I couldn\u2019t wake up either and it changed my life.", "NTA. He is TA", "NTA, he's a grown-up and needs to act like one", "**After saying no a bunch of times he gets extremely pissed off at me. I don\u2019t want to continuously be calling him with my dad in the car.**\n\nOK but come on now calling twice in a half hour period isn't \"continuously\".  You just don't want to do it--and there's nothing necessarily wrong with that but it's not that big an ask and maybe the fact that you don't want to do it and would rather figure with your bf over it is a sign that the relationship isn't serving either of you.   NAH just two people not really in a relationship.", "STOP.  JUST. STOP.  You are not responsible for his choices.  This is his life.  You manage yourself and he manages himself.  If you have kids, you teach them to be autonomous and eventually transition them from being reliant on you to being independent.\n\nYou DO NOT do this for another adult.  NTA.  He needs to figure this out without you and without his mother.", "Without even reading the story and just glancing at the title - NTA", "I really small child, my mother never woke me up, if you were not up and ready to go on your own then you were being left behind.", "TBH you\u2019ve only heard one side of the story, so YTA for not hearing both sides and making a decision based on facts! \n\nYTA! Deal with it!!", "This idea reminds me of the cartoon \"a bear of punishment\"\n\n[https://looneytunes.fandom.com/wiki/A\\_Bear\\_for\\_Punishment?file=A\\_Bear\\_For\\_Punishment\\_%281951%29\\_with\\_original\\_titles\\_recreation](https://looneytunes.fandom.com/wiki/A_Bear_for_Punishment?file=A_Bear_For_Punishment_%281951%29_with_original_titles_recreation)\n\nI'd love those that idea in action", "That's why they want brains so badly, so they can go back to sleep", "NTA. Phones have alarms for a reason.", "Hi I have ADHD and this seems like something that would definitely irritate the living fk out of me, while also being something that I really need.   \n\n\nWhat's the name of the app please?? \ud83d\ude4f", "Do you see how it may be kind of not good that you're worried more about how your dad will judge him (you ultimately can't control that you can only try to manipulate the perception like you are trying to do) than you are about helping your bf to make sure he gets to a doctor's appointment?", "Someone posted above saying it's called Alarmy. Sounds like a good one for meds as well!", "Fellow adhd...\n\nWalk me up and barcode alarm are good.\n\nETA: the one I use for the picture is not in English.", "Thanks, I just downloaded it.", "oh yes i used this for a while. Nothing like trying to calculate 52+77+121 while 90% asleep while the app is screaming at you", "Man just reading this post annoyed me."]}
