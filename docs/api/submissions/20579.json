In fact my mom is this way too so I thought to myself \u201cwhy haven\u2019t we ever tried that?\u201d Then I remembered it\u2019s my mom we\u2019re talking about and she would throw the biggest fit known to mankind if we tried to do something like that because she\u2019d say we\u2019re unreasonable and unfair and rude. It would not end well for us at all. She likes to threaten us with her \u201cleaving\u201d bc she \u201cclearly is no good for us.\u201d\nBasically all of this to say that sometimes what seems like a simple solution is in fact not even an option unless you want to unleash the biggest monster known to mankind.\n\nAlso also NTA but if you figure out how to deal with/fix this please let me know too", "Throw a fit back at her.", "Your mom throws a fit because she knows you will cave. Stop rewarding bad behavior.", "Lie to her about what time things start.\n\nIf X starts at 2 tell her it starts at 1 so she'll be ready by 2", "She can stay home? If she can\u2019t be ready on time how is this a bad solution?", "Well unfortunately I still live at home and she can very much decide whether or not I can go out, hang out with people, have a car and such, so for now I try to aim for smooth sailing", "If you are an adult as you say then leave your recalcitrant wife behind and do your own thing", "Well leave her ehind is the only thing you can do. \n\nWhy come here to just argue'", "So if you don't go, that means you stay home without a vehicle and they go without you? Why isn't it the other way around.", "What wrong about leaving her home without a vehicle? That's literally what you should do if she's gonna make you late, especially if it's somewhere necessary and important to you or your child. She's also an adult. Adults are fine at home without a car. I assume you have TV, phones, computers/tablets. She will find something to do until you return. \n\nIf it's for emergency reasons then that's more a fear on yourself than her. But as the other person said, it's a suggestion. You asked for them, people are giving them to you, and you make more excuses as to why that can't be done. Leaving her at home can 100% be done and is your only recourse. My father was a perpetually late person for as long as I've been alive and until he passed away 2 years ago. You cannot change someone like that. \n\nYour wife decided long ago that no one was telling her when she had to be somewhere and at what time. So she makes her own time. I'm not calling her a narcissist as I know nothing about her, but perpetual lateness is a narcissistic trait as she has no respect for anyone's time but her own. Sadly, you and your child are no exception to this. \n\nA late person is forever a late person. You can accept it and go by yourself and leave her home, or you can just always be late anywhere you go. Good luck to you. I hope you find a way to make it good for everyone involved, I truly do.", "Why can\u2019t he just stay home and let her go late alone?", "So are you unable to work if she says so? Would this not be concerning? Your wife is manipulative and and wants to gas light you unto believing otherwise", "It took you THIS long to tell us this lil factoid? \ud83d\ude44", "NTA Get a friend to pick you and your child up, on time, the next 5 outings. If you're going to church, DO NOT save her a seat. This is a good time to practice natural consequences.\nI still think her car is a family car. If a wife posted that is not her car, everybody would be jumping on that. She's married with a baby. It's a family car.", "Exactly.  that\u2019s why I don\u2019t take it. I\u2019d be in a lot more shit if I just took her car than if I just stay home if she makes us late.  She bought it so I\u2019d never just leave with it.", "Now kith"]}
