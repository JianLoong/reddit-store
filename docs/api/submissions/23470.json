Other folks I know have parents in two countries in Europe kids live in northern US and they themselves live in the southern US.  Realize that the decisions you make will result in the life that you will have, accept that and keep moving forward.  yes, some decisions will drive others crazy, some may make you unhappy.

Not with your sisters, but with those that actually matter.", "Gee, I wonder why OP doesn't seem to like their family.\n\nMight it be related to how when they announced they got their dream job, their sisters immediately made it about themselves, in an especially AH way?", "This is a great response. Thank you. I wouldn't have thought to mention that.\n\nThere is a local university which is a 30-minute drive away. I wanted to experience the whole experience of going to a university far away and living away from home. At the time, I felt pressured to attend the local university as it was \"convenient\" for them. Due to the pressure, I felt, I ended up picking the local university, yes, it saved me a lot of money as I got to continue living at home, but I just wanted to experience the whole experience. \n\nMy family did say they would come and visit me but it was always me having to see them. I've always been fully independent (Due to the toxic relationship with my family, I had to grow up fast to survive). \n\nSome people have told me I've experienced the full experience of university as my mum died during the third and final year, she was a single parent. I've lived on my own ever since.", "I don\u2019t disagree with you. Doesn\u2019t change the fact that there isn\u2019t a conflict here."]}
