The only issues is because the dream job was working for a multi billion pound corporation based in Central London the application would take 6 months. \n\nI decided to keep this secret as I don't really have that family support system. My family are really dysfunctional if there was a scale it be in the billions. I knew if I told them that I applied for this job 1) they would get mad at how far I'm moving away 2)If I didn't get the job offer they would only say negative stuff like \"you deserve it\" you're nothing but a failure. \n\nAbout a month ago I received an email congratulating me saying I got the job, I'm really excited to start. Now I know I'm probably the ahole when it comes to this but I am a workaholic and will always put work first before anyone, obviously if I start dating I will put my partner first before everything else. \n\nI have two sisters, Claire and Chloe. Claire is a university graduate, she works part time, she owns a house that her parents in law brought for her worth \u00a3500,000.00 and she also has a child. Chloe lives with Claire and her husband. Chloe refuses to work and Claire refuses to work full time.  \n\nDuring the application process whenever I visited my sisters the first thing they would complain about is finances. Claire said she  was always in the minuses when it came to paying her bills and food. \n\nTwo weeks ago Claires parents in law was organising a family dinner and invited me round. I decided to go, I felt that was the perfect moment to announce I got a job and moving to central London but I made sure to wait until after the family dinner was over. \n\nWhen I announced it my sisters were arguing and shouting at me calling me an ahole for moving to London knowing they can't afford to come up to me as regularly. They shouted that they can only come and visit me once or twice a year. \n\nI feel like I'm an ahole because I knew that it would be a struggle for them to come up and see me. I do drive and I could go and see them but I'd rather say I'm busy with work as we don't get along, never have and never will. But then I feel like I'm not the ahole as I'm putting myself first, my career first and plus they don't have to pay their parents-in-law back for that house and it's two doors down from my brother-in-law parents house. \n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nPS: Anymore information needed will be provided.
