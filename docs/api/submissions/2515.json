He is not in any way ready for a Canadian winter.  \n\nThe temperature got down to -5 C so that's about 23 F.  \n\nHe is currently wearing a t-shirt, a sweatshirt, a hoody, a puffy parka, and a fire resistant parka.  \n\nI am wearing two t-shirts, a sweatshirt and a hoody.  Plus long johns under my pants.  \n\nI don't know what he has on under his pants.  \n\nHe looks like the Michelin Man he is so insulated.  \n\nThe thing is that we work outside until it is -34 C or - 30 F.  \n\nI laughed because he looked funny and because he is going to have a hard time if he thinks that this is cold.  \n\nI talked to him about dressing in layers and that it is very important to keep your body from sweating because if you sweat then go out into the cold you can lose body temperature very easily.  \n\n\nOne of the other guys I work with called me an asshole for laughing at my friend.  I told him that I wasn't trying to be mean or anything. I have laughed at new hires before when they react badly to our working conditions.  I wasn't picking on the new guy because he is an immigrant or anything.  \n\n But he keeps insisting that I am a jerk for laughing.

Though you could maybe ask your Nigerian coworker how he feels about that!", "This is really going to depend on your relationship with the coworker and how he feels about it. \n\nBut to be safe, you should probably choose your words and actions carefully. \n\nThat IS cold. Especially to someone who is possibly not accustomed to it. It's like when people from Michigan go to Florida and wear a Tshirt while locals are bundled up. Our bodies (typically, within reason) get accustomed to the weather where we live. This can take years, though and some people never get used to the change. There are also people who for whatever reason live in the same climate their whole lives and never quite get used to it. \n\nI don't think you're an asshole necessarily, but without actually seeing the interactions and knowing how the coworker feels, it's really hard to judge this. He could just be laughing it off even though it makes him uncomfortable, he may agree and find it funny. I wouldn't even expect him to give an honest answer if questioned about it, as he may fear retaliation or other poor treatment if he voices concern/is uncomfortable with it.", "NTA, that\u2019s not really about him being an immigrant just him adjusting to the weather. I am not an immigrant and people laugh at me in the cold. If you had made a joke about his country or stereotypes then you\u2019d be TA", "NTA. That was probably pretty funny stuff.To the Nigerian coworker, too.", "NTA.\n\nYou guys are friends and seem to have an understanding with each other. And he's Nigerian, not blind. He, himself, probably knows he looks weird compared to those who know how to dress for the weather.\n\nYou didn't say anything mean spirited. You also let him know that this is nothing and worse is yet to come. (wait til Jan or Feb) and that you'll help him out.\n\nAs an immigrant I hate it that people think we have no sense of humor. We know we look funny under the 3 pants and 3 shirts. I sure feel silly having limited movement due to so many piled on clothes. Now go get your laugh on and then help us out.", "NTA. Sounds like you're helping him adjust.", "NTA - this sounds like the scene from Cool Runnings when the Jamacian bobsled team arrives in Calgary for the winter olympics.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCmp2qbrZUQ", "In situations like this it\u2019s a case of knowing your audience\u2026.

You seem like a good friend. \n\nYou could make sure to say that you hope that he wasn\u2019t offended by your initial reaction to his attempts to keep warm, but I expect he already knows it was good-hearted amusement and not cruelty.", "I\u2019m going to say NTA because I don\u2019t feel you were mean spirited about it. It\u2019s not like you pointed at him and said \u201chey everyone look at how silly he looks\u201d. It sounds more like you just got a laugh out of it. Since you are trying to help him prepare then I think it\u2019s okay. \n\nMake sure he gets good gloves and socks too. \n\nHello from Alberta.", "NTA. It wasn't about him being an immigrant, per se, just... All bundled up like the Michelin man, which must've looked funny -- and if he himself finds the situation funny, then there's no issue (if he did, it might be a different story). From your post, it doesn't seem like you were mean about it or belittling him.\n\nI come from a country with a similar climate to Nigeria, and now I live in the Northern hemisphere. We don't even get to the negative Celsius where I am, we're in the mid-10s right now, but *I'm not used to it*. We don't have this kind of cold back home, and I'm in layers already (and my coworkers also find it funny XD). I can't even fathom how cold your friend must be, please help him shop XD.", "INFO: How do these new hires react when you laugh at them? Basically, are you laughing at them or with them? How did this particular coworker react to you laughing? When you laughed, was it like a chuckle or were you more guffawing?\n\nBasically, if you\u2019re upsetting people or making fun of them, you\u2019re the problem, even if you don\u2019t mean to be hurtful. If it truly is in jest and the other person (i.e. the new hire) knows this and also laughs and/or jokes about it, you\u2019re good.\n\nPersonally, I don\u2019t think you\u2019re trying to be rude; you\u2019re taking the man shopping! However, that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean it\u2019s okay that you laughed.", "YTA.\n\n> I have laughed at new hires before when they react badly to our working conditions.\n\nLook, I\u2019m glad the current new guy doesn\u2019t seem to have taken your amusement badly.  But sooner or later, *someone\u2019s* not going to.  And yes, adjusting to a totally unfamiliar situation *is* hard.  Better to lead with the advice and offer to help than \u201cboy, are *you* unprepared, Stay-Puft.\u201d", "Dude, who are *you* to determine that it\u2019s \u201cnot that cold\u201d if someone else thinks it is? You might think it\u2019s hilarious, but this guy is from a different country and isn\u2019t used to the weather where you live. The weather is a totally different ball park in Nigeria.\n\nBasically, he probably thinks it\u2019s cold af and wants to be as comfortable as he possibly can, and you\u2019re being an asshole for laughing at what someone looks like and telling them that they\u2019re going to have a hard time just because they aren\u2019t acclimated to the weather that you are used to living in.\n\nHe might look funny by being bundled up, but you\u2019re legitimately invalidating someone else\u2019s feelings just because apparently it\u2019s hilarious to you that someone may find it colder than you do.\n\nYes, YTA.", "NTA, BUT it\u2019s still not very nice. That would be like me laughing at people wearing a hat, carrying and umbrella, wearing sunscreen and Uv blocking clothes while hiding in the shade here in Florida.

If you and your Nigerian friend are ok with joking and having fun about the whole situation why should others be bothered? You are friends and aren't friends allowed to laugh and have fun? You're not laughing, making fun of him and ignoring him, you're going to help him moving his arms while working. What is the other coworker do? Is he planning to help the Nigerian prepare for winter?", "NTA, the only opinion that matters is your friends...if he's ok, making jokes etc. then you've got nothing to be sorry for.", "NTA. You're laughing WITH him, not at him. Your other coworker sounds like they might have a bit of a white savior complex tbh", "NTA because he was laughing at himself. If you were making fun of him for not knowing how to layer/dress for winter after coming from a hot country then you'd would've been an asshole. \n\nEvery immigrant has plenty of stories about dumb shit we did in our first couple years specially if we're moving from super different countries. It's a rite of passage lol.\n\nBut you should totally take your friend shopping for proper winter clothing. Specially for the first year. Our bodies adjust after that and it gets better but the first year is rough", "Any A-holiness is kinda mitigated by you taking the time to help him and explain the importance of layers and taking him to get getter cold. No one told me about that my first time into the extreme cold and when the chill from my sweat was trapped under all the crap I was wearing it seemed to go straight to the bone.", "NTA - Your Nigerian friend found the humour in it so why can't your other co-worker? You had a light laugh at a man dressed a bit hilarious, its funny, its ok. This must be what people mean when someone is a snowflake...", "Canadians are built differently. The only way we can tolerate the cold is by enjoying new people\u2019s misery and responding \u2018just wait, this is nothing\u2019.  Anyone who\u2019s been in -40 for 3+ months solid would have laughed with you. Then we\u2019d all give tips on surviving the winter and tell him to take breaks inside to warm up. NTA you\u2019re just following the protocol for Canuck initiation", "NTA. I've been laughed at for looking like I'm as round as I am tall because of all my snow gear. Also, thank you for helping out your co-worker to find some good clothes so he stays warm once it gets colder.", "NTA You and your Nigerian Maggie Simpson are finding humor in the situation.  Your other co-worker seems to be missing the humor gene.", "NTA I feel like you were laughing with him vs at him, even though he wasn't laughing if that makes sense?", "NTA.  From what your describe, it doesn't seem like you were being cruel (you even gave him helpful advice and tips).  Also, your friend made fun of himself and laughed.  If I lived in your climate, I would also layer to the point of looking like a starfish, and I would be the first one to make fun of myself.  If there was an inkling that your friend was bothered by your laughter, then it'd be different.", "He said he looks like a starfish and he can't really move his arms.", "I am from Somalia. He asked me for help getting proper winter work clothes.", "Agreed. I'm not an immigrant and these good hearted Vermont folks are joking about me bundling up.  Lol. I'm from Texas and it snowed last night.   I even had a fella apologize for the Vermont weather welcoming me so badly.  Also, people joking about my nikes instead of wearing boots. Lol  People on the outside usually take things the wrong way.", "I have never seen this movie.  Thanks. I will invite him to come see it. It looks funny.", "Oh yeah.  We need to get him kitted out better. He can't reach out in front of himself with both hands.", "We are in Fort Mac.", "I have worked with him since May.  He and I are friends.  I moved here from Somalia as a kid si I went through the same thing but at school.  My mom bundled me up until I could barely move. And all of us laugh at the FNGs that can't handle the hours and days that we work.", "I laugh whenever a new kid shows up and freaks out because we work 12 hour days.  I laugh when they are here for two weeks and have another 16 days to go and are already bagged.  This job isn't for everyone but I think this guy will do great.", "I am taking him shopping for better work clothes because he can't dress like this for work.  He literally cannot work in this get up. He cannot put his arms in front of his body.", "He can't move his arms to work in front of himself.   My point was that if he thinks that this is cold he is going to have a tough time when it gets cold.  But I get your point.", "At first I read it the same way as you, but i think he means it sort of like,\n\n\u201cnot that cold (YET)\u201d as in this new employee doesn\u2019t have the life experience to understand the best way to dress warm. \n\nFloridian here, and I\u2019m going to be honest. I didn\u2019t know that about the layers and not sweating, and i do indeed look like I\u2019m about to go stay in an igloo visiting family up north in 30\u00b0f weather.\n\nI think it\u2019s clear by the way he ends the story that he\u2019s taking the new person shopping for winter gear that he has good intentions. I think they can both have a laugh at how he imagined the best way to stay warm turned him into the Michelin man simply because it\u2019s clear this is a new climate! OP is helping him prepare for when the weather is even worse, because you can only layer so many parkas before you no longer fit in a standard drivers seat to get to your place of work lol", "Probably not.  There is a sale right now because of Black Friday so we are going into town tonight to get him better clothes.", "Like that kid in A Christmas Story?", "What I meant is, how does he feel when you address the situation sarcastically? Maybe he understands the humor and appreciates your help in finding new clothes (this seems like the most probable scenario to me) or maybe he finds your comments a bit offensive and sort of thinks you are an AH.", "Ok, that changes the context a bit. But you should probably still err on the side of caution. Even if he is ok with it, someone else may not be and that could create unnecessary issues.  \n\nKudos on helping him out with getting the proper attire - working outside in the cold is miserable enough in the right clothes.", "Oh dear. He is in for it up there.  I\u2019m down closer to Edmonton.  Windy today.", "Okay, but who is \u201call of us\u201d? It sounds like you\u2019re saying that all of the current, experienced staff laugh at the new hires, which is absolutely condescending and makes you all the AH.\n\n\nIt\u2019s like, I\u2019m sensing some empathy on your part because you\u2019ve experienced this same adjustment process so you know how to help someone else adjust \u2026 but you also seem to find way too much amusement in other people\u2019s discomfort, be it unfamiliarity with the cold or with strenuous work hours.", "Well when you put it that way, it\u2019s decent of you to help him buy proper work clothes.\n\nMaybe he doesn\u2019t have the means or something lol", "Fair enough! Sorry I misunderstood", "He said that he feels like Maggie Simpson in a snowsuit.", "This is all I can think of also \ud83e\udd23", "No. He thinks that he looks funny. And he is aware that he cannot work in that set of clothing. He thinks it's funny. Another guy I work with is the one who has the problem.  \n\nI moved to Canada from Somalia. I went through the same thing.  But in school not at work. I moved here as a kid.", "Yeah he may find it kind of amusing too because he\u2019s never had to dress like that. So he might be getting a laugh at his own expense in which case it\u2019s fine", "That's what I said. Poor guy doesn't know cold yet.", "He can afford them. He just didn't know what to buy.", "NTA because it sounds like you were laughing WITH your coworker, and that he has a good attitude towards it as well (love his starfish and Simpsons comments!). Also good on you for helping him out and taking him shopping!", "Tell your friend hes got street cred with me for that simpsons reference also NTA!", "Well, that\u2019s good that you\u2019re helping him"]}
