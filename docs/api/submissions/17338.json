Of course you're NTA,  but I feel like I'm missing something.", "NTA they sound very entitled and are just looking to use you. The fact they exclude your daughter from things just proves it. \n\nIgnore them and take the time to spend with your daughter just the two of you it will mean a lot to her in the end..", "the audacity and entitlement people have is disgusting. if they wanna go on a vacation, THEY can pay for it. wtf", "Op I need you to reread your post and comments. This isn't a \"you are spending a lot of money, why not spend a little more\" type of situation.  They don't like your daughter and don't want her to have this trip. They take fun trips and refuse to take her - even with you footing the entire bill. This is a weird and alarming behavior. An additional 7 people is ridiculous, selfish, and entitled. I 100% bet if it's a family trip you'll spend less time with her too.\n\nNTA. But realize this looks a lot more like they don't see your daughter as family or deserving of this trip.", "NTA what the actual fuck is wrong with these asshole. I'd go NC so fast.", "NTA\n\nIf your family wants to go on vacation, it's their own responsibility to pay their costs to do so.  No one is owed a vacation.", "Have an amazing holiday and bond with your daughter one-on-one.\n\nObviously decline to take anyone else.", "Nta. If they want to go they can pay their own way", "Wtf definitely NTA \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f my mum and brother get annoyed if I book a holiday without them for me and my daughter... BUT if I do invite them, they at least pay for themselves!!! Sometimes I just want to chill with my kid? \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f She's nearly 13 and my best friend we have fun together, I like spending time with her on my own! Fuck them dude", "NTA. I\u2019ve been on a Disney Cruise.  They\u2019re expensive and amazing.  \n\nBonding with your daughter is important.  She\u2019s only eight once.  You guys will have a great time.  Go on the giant water slide for me!", "NTA a trip planned for you and your daughter to bond is very different to a whole family vacation.", "You better not take anyone else besides your daughter on this trip. Seems to me everyone is walking on you and your daughter and you\u2019re just allowing it to happen.", "Their through processes are irrelevant, your financial decisions are absolutely nothing to do with them. How would they feel if you went into their home, snooped through their private documents and then told them how they should not be spending their hard earned money on themselves and their children, but on you and your daughter instead. This entire situation is absolutely ludicrous.", "Nope that is not justification for their behavior. My brother took his family to Hawaii for 2 weeks. Never in my little brain did I even think \u201cif they only go for 1 they could pay for my family too!\u201d NTA-hope you and daughter have a blast", "Your missing the point. They invaded your privacy, they disregard your daughter on the regular by not including her (even though you offer to pay for her!!!!) and now they're demanding you do the same by taking away from her to give to them! That is NOT ok. You need to spell this out to them when you tell them NO for the last time. Please don't change your vacation, don't give to takers. NTA but you will be if you cave.", "My goodness your family are all leeches and entitled. NTA.", "NTA\n\nWhy does your family exclude your daughter? I couldn't tolerate that, personally", "nta and no just no!", "NTA say entitled brats, what the fish, why do they feel you have to fund their recreation for them?\n\nTalk about being selfish, excluding your daughter at family activities and then having the gal to demand you shorten your daughters vacation so they can come along?\n\nTime to consider going NC until they learn their lesson, holy cows", "NTA. What narcissistic entitled bullshit is this? OP you do not need these people in your life. They don't care about you or your daughter, they just care about your money. Absolutely do not pay for them to come on your vacation. Don't pay for them for anything, ever.", "So they have intentionally excluded your daughter in the past, and now they want to take this special time you\u2019ve planned for her and make it about themselves? My response would be absolutely nuclear. What were they doing going through your papers in the first place?! Cut them off! NTA", "NTA\n\ndid they snoop around or was the folder already on the table?\n\n8 years is old eough to make great memories if she were a lot younger it would have been questionable.\n\nand if they exclude your daughter you don't have to include them. would you have joined them or would you have just unloaded your daughter?\n\nbut maybe start with something small one sister with children, those who are closest in age to your daughter, to the zoo.\n\nmending familial relations is hard and long better not let it get to the breaking point, but how close are you to your sisters?", "NTA - what a bunch of greedy family members. Do not do it and the word NO is a complete sentence. Tell them this is planned and scheduled. If they want to plan a family trip in the future for all, and they pay their way, then sure talk about it. \n\nShut this discussion down with the family about the current trip that is planned.\n\nI will tell you that this will be the best trip/time for you and your daughter. The bonding that can occur while making an adventure is priceless. And it does not have to be an expensive vacation. Go! Just the two of you and enjoy yourselves.", "I am having a hard time wrapping my mind around this situation... \n\nhow could exactly someone be so entitled to demand they cancel their planned vacation and not only invite the entire family but to also PAY for the entire family to go\n\nlike wtf?\n\nNTA", "NTA.    Your sisters are entitled and presumptuous.    Stick to your g*ns and take those trips w your daughter.    She will cherish the memories.   Also, keep daughter far from sisters, or they will try to manipulate her/guilt trip her to ask you if they can join.", "NTA, id be careful that said family dont try to cancel your holiday for you just to spite you though, maybe contact the booking companies and inform them that any contact should only be through you, your phone number and your email only, i know it sounds like that should be the normal but you never know", "DO NOT TALK ABOUT THIS ANYMORE", "So, did your family just gloss over the fact your sister was snooping? Or the fact they don\u2019t invite your daughter to things.  \nI would absolutely be petty af about that if my sister DEMANDED I do anything extra for her if she didn\u2019t at least ask nicely or be greatfull. \n\n\u201cI have decided to THINK about paying your family\u2019s way to our vacation since the last vacations went so well dont you remember?\u201d \nAnd then look at your daughter to also sarcastically say \u201cyea! We had so much fun together didn\u2019t we it\u2019s a shame we\u2019re not in any photos ever though\u201d", "NTA\nset houndaries now, you made excuses and that won't cut it in the long run", "They excluded your only daughter, despite you offering to pay extra. Then when you decide to do something for your daughter, they all want in and for you to do coin? Fuvk that they're the assholes not you. I would do the same for my kid of they constantly got shafted from the family. NTA", "NTA and it is a bizarre leap for them to take! I could see saying that it looks like a great trip and *suggesting* making it a bigger family trip, but to demand it, and not only that, but also demand that you to pay for *13 more people* is crazy!", "This is a very weird and disney-villian-esque ask... They amount of financial entitlement mind blowing, but even nuttier is the disregard for you and your daughter. This is your special time with your daughter, a time to bond and strengthen your relationship and be together, since you don't get to be with her (i imagine) as often as you would like. Sharing custody must be so hard for both you and your daughter and they have zero respect for that. NTA, definitely do not invite them and let them hijack your bonding time.", "Good grief.\n\nNTA.\n\nYou are not in any way the asshole here.", "NTA\n\nMy god these people are clinically insane, OP. Keep yourself and your daughter away from them as much as possible. Who needs these kind of entitled greedy fucks in their lives? Life is 100% better without them, I guarantee it.", "NTA- I would have thrown them all out for being such assholes. The nerve and entitlement of them.", "Their vacations are not your responsibility.", "Why are you responsible for other adults holidays?", "NTA", "NTA\n\nTake your daughter and have a great time. They can save up and go next year.", "NTA\n\nWas the folder lying around open? Or did they open it themselves, maybe even went snooping through your drawers? The audacity. \n\nIf they searched through my drawers and cabinets, I would never invite them into my home again.", "It's your money? It's not their money? So why the hell should they be angry? \n\nYou can do whatever you want to do with YOUR money. And if you want to go to a fancy trip with your daughter - then you can do it.\n\nYou should stand your ground and they should apologize.", "Your sister was snooping through your personal documents on your desk. This is NOT appropriate behavior for family members. It sounds like they are taking advantage of you and bullying you.", "so she was snooping. \n\nand she was ok with the cost when she thought it was for THEM. it's only too expensive and fancy when it's just for you and your daughter? \n\nNTA but stop making excuses for them", "1st-NTA. Reading your post and response/comments hurts my heart! It\u2019s clear that you are genuinely just a good person.  Despite their repugnant behavior, you continue to create excuses for them. It\u2019s really sad that they obviously abuse your kindness. NOTHING justifies what they said and did. YOUR money and plans are NONE of their business!! Please do yourself a favor and take the advice offered to you repeatedly in these comments! Set boundaries and stop making excuses for their terrible treatment of you! Enjoy your trip with your daughter!!", "Yeah, dude your generosity is 100% being manipulated. For your daughter's sake I hope you stick to original plans but from this comment it sure sounds like they successfully played you...", "It's nice that your family apologized but none of the explanation ecxuses their behavior. All this does is make me feel more sorry fir your daughter. She is not valued at her mother's house nor by your extended family. Go on that trip with just your child and show her the time of her life. Give her a great memory with her dad.\n\nYour family sound so resentful of that poor little girl and thier husband's working is not an excuse for that. Your parents, I don't even know what to say about that mess. Just so sorry for your daughter.", "It\u2019s really sad to see you continue to make excuses for your family. When comments continue to point out how and why their behavior is still unacceptable, you go one step further.-Now attempting to make yourself look bad for planning the trip to begin with?! You can\u2019t see it apparently- but your \u201cintentions\u201d ABSOLUTELY WERE good and noble!!! - AND even IF they weren\u2019t, their behavior is STILL NOT acceptable.", "It doesn't matter what they think. This is for you and your daughter. Not them. They crossed some serious boundaries here.", "Why was your sister looking through your personal things? NTA", "It doesn't matter how much money you're paying, you don't owe them anything. Your obligation is to your daughter, hell you could've pulled out a personal loan to pay for it. Its none of their business what you do with your daughter and money. The fact that they kept her out of the loop despite you offering to cover costs all the time proves they just didn't want the burden of having to entertain your child on their already planned trip.\n\nThis is selfish on their part. You do what you must as a dad for your child, they can figure out their own trips, like they have been doing for years.", "I think they said she was snooping around a home office..."]}
