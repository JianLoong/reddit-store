Don't bake anything for him because it's not going to shut him up. I assume he's perfectly capable of baking or getting desserts for himself.

Is he by any chance called Wim? He sounds like my previous boss. Suggestion: do you know if there is something he doesn't like to eat? A flavour or fruit or something he dislikes?

I simply replied \"well yeah ever since June I stopped baking\" our general manager figured out what I meant... I'd lost my dad in June. Boss didn't.

I would tell him very politely that you appreciate he likes your baking but that you only bake for fun when the mood strikes and that you would appreciate if he stops asking. If he brings it up again remind him of that conversation. If he bring a it up a third time tell him very firmly that you have asked him to not nag you to bake for him, and it\u2019s he\u2019s so interested in a desert he can bake it himself or go to a local bakery. \n\nRecord dates and times and then tell your manager.", "Hello since i dont know how to edit the post i would like to add why i dont bring it up to my manager or tell him blatanly is beacuse he would think i wont bake for him cuz hes not native to my country.. hes been very sensetive to critiscim and telling my manager might make things worse.. also its only my coworker that thinks ppl disslike him or something because hes not native witch isnt true ofc, hes been going trought divorce so i really dont want to agitate the situation so i kinda feel stuck between a rock and a hard place.\n If i tell him no he prob would think im raceist and if i tell my manager my coworker would know it was me that complained.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You're being harassed to provide free labor and food. You don't need to do that. You *do* need to tell your manager that another co-worker keeps demanding you bake for them, and that you need help drawing boundaries.

Just tell him 'Do not ask about baking anymore.  I don't like to be bossed around. Please drop it now.'"]}
