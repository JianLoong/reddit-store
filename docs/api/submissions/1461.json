Realized this week I needed to cancel a night, and I went to the third party website, and after talking with them I ended up canceling the whole reservation with the intention of re-booking for the correct dates. I asked about the deposit, and they said i\u2019d have to go through the hotel to get it back. I thought that was weird and double checked with them but ultimately decided to just go through the hotel since they were insistent. \n\nThe next morning I called the hotel. First time I called I was sent to the wrong department, and they forwarded me somewhere and I got hung up on. I called back and chose the front desk option. A woman answered and immediately hung up. I called back and chose front desk again. It rang a bunch and then went back to the first wrong department who couldn\u2019t transfer me anywhere and insisted I called the wrong number and then gave me the number I called. I called one last time and chose the front desk and finally talked to someone. \n\nA woman answered. I was very frustrated at this point, and I told her up front that I was. I like to do this so they know I\u2019m not necessarily mad at them if I seem upset or angry. I told her the situation and without checking anything she said I had to go through the third party site. I explained that they insisted I had to go through the hotel and I don\u2019t know why this is happening and she yelled \u201cBECAUSE IT\u2019S THEIR MO.\u201d I was taken aback and asked her to email me something to show that they don\u2019t have my money. She got obstinate and said she wouldn\u2019t do that because they don\u2019t have anything. I said she could just send an email explaining it and then she started yelling sarcastically \u201cSO YOU WANT ME TO SEND YOU AN EMPTY FOLIO?\u201d And kept asking why I needed that. \n\nThis is where I think I was the asshole. I lost what little cop I had at this point and yelled \u201cBECAUSE I\u2019M A GODDAMN FUCKING LAWYER AND I NEED PROOF FOR WHEN I GO BACK TO THEM.\u201d Then she got really mad and kept yelling about the empty folio. She finally emailed it to me, and when I asked her for her name she hung up on me after sarcastically giving the hotel name. \n\nAITA for losing my cool and swearing at her?\n\nETA:\n1) I probably could\u2019ve been nicer from the start, but, like I said, I was already frustrated, and I was hoping she would see it wasn\u2019t with her necessarily. \n2) I did send a complaint afterwards to their corporate and the GM emailed me exactly what I asked her to send me, which was a cancellation letter showing nothing was charged.\n3) I got the situation figured out through the third party website", "created_utc": 1667622057, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ymjy7i/aita_for_swearing_when_speaking_to_a_customer/", "score": 6, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It's not because they are bad people.  It's because of poor training.   Hotels usually emphasize training on customer service, but apparently not in this case. As you mentioned, your behavior wasn't exactly respectful, either.   Combine these elements and social disaster is the usual outcome.   NTA.   You failed to overcome the emotions of the moment, but we've all experienced the same failure.   You recognize that you could have done better and accept responsibility for your part.  Let's hope the other party recognizes the same.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.

Also, the third party site sent you to the hotel bc they don\u2019t want to deal with you. Don\u2019t use third parties for reservations, it\u2019s like a rule of life.", "I mean NTA for being frustrated but you shouldn\u2019t swear at her. Also how is being a lawyer relevant?", "You're NTA\n\nMaybe I'm just a nice person, but everyone has the right to lose their cool at some points. The hotel staff were clearly being rude to you since you mentioned they hung up on you more then once. You told the lady you were frustrated already which is better then just losing it without warning. She was just being sarcastic the whole time which wouldn't of helped anyone, especially at the end when she just refused to give you her name, which makes sense to ask with the context given.", "YTA\n\nIf you really were a lawyer you\u2019d be well travelled and KNOW the rules and laws with booking through third party websites and that is that THEY keep the money until you physically check in on the day you booked for\n\nI suspect to have gotten the reaction you did you were probably rude and belligerent from the start and the hotel staff member probably lost her cool because she deals with 100 entitled people like you a day", "NTA getting the run around sucks, and unless you're a Saint you're going to get upset. That's some really bad customer service you received.", "The thing is that I do understand customer service because I\u2019ve worked in it and am currently in a client-facing job where I work with assholes every day. When someone calls me and is already mad I usually am very calm with them until it\u2019s clear they are still being unreasonable.", "Because it\u2019s why I think about needing proof for things. I knew I couldn\u2019t just go back to the third party and say the hotel wasn\u2019t honoring the request because they wouldn\u2019t go for that, but if I went with something that showed the hotel didn\u2019t have my money they would have more pressure to give it back. I\u2019m sure non-lawyers would do that too, but since I was so frustrated I wanted her to realize that I wasn\u2019t just asking to be an ass and I knew why I wanted it.", "People are often frightened by the thought of a lawsuit.", "That\u2019s not how lawyers work, sweet pea. But note taken on the rest of it.", "My comments about customer service are about the hotel representative and not about you.  I edited the original post to clarify.   Sorry for my error.", "A font desk receptionist doesn\u2019t care if you threaten a lawsuit. They have no stake", "That makes more sense lol. Thanks for clarifying.", "YTA. Your behavior was unacceptable, and it wasn't that worker's fault.", "As a front desk clerk, she did better than I would have. As soon as the voice raises I hang up. I don't get paid enough to deal with that. Esh. Obviously op is downplaying their rudeness and upplaying the rudeness of the front desk agent, but yeah, if you want a blank paper, she should have just sent you a blank paper but you shouldn't yell.", "I would like to make it very clear that I was not threatening to sue and had no intention of doing that. I wanted the documentation so I could go back to the third party and show them that the hotel doesn\u2019t have my money so the third party must have it. I was intending to tell them that it\u2019s the third party\u2019s job to pay me back and then they can handle the hotel if they need reimbursement. I hate threatening to sue, and I don\u2019t do it unless I know that it\u2019s a valid claim and something I\u2019m actually willing to do.", "They have because they'll get in trouble with management if it was mentioned that their attitude was part of why the hotel gets sued.", "Having a bad attitude is not something you can sue for. Lol."]}
