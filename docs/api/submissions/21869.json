{"id": 21869, "submission_id": "14vzmcm", "title": "AITA for telling my sister no when she asked me to babysit for four days", "selftext": "I (28F) have a government job that is extremely intense during the first half of the year (Jan-June). It requires me to travel 3 hours to the state capitol every week on Mondays, stay in that city for a few days in a hotel, and then head back home on Thursdays (another 3 hour drive). Which means I'm in a car for 6 hours a week, in a hotel for three nights, and then have to repeat that every week for about 6 months. For the second half of the year I work from home. During the first half of the year I get about 5 hours or less of sleep a day, and sometimes I am working nights, weekends, or I am stuck in that hotel for a full week because work dragged on extra days past Thursday. Now that I am in the later half of the year, work is much lighter and I get to be at home, relax, and catch up on life. \nMy sister has two kids. One is a 4month old baby, and the other is 3. She asked me the other day if I could babysit her two kids for 4 days because she wants to go on vacation with her partner and needs someone to watch them. Bear in mind, I live 4 hours away from my sister. So I would have to either drive, or take a bus down. \nI am still so exhausted by the first half of the year that doing a long distance drive or bus ride feels awful. So I told her no. I told her I can't make it down, and I just want to relax. She thinks that I am being selfish because I have all this free time now and I don't want to help out. I told her that I would be willing to help her with money if she doesn't have any to pay a baby sitter. But she insists on me. She told our mom about it, and my mom agrees with her that I am being selfish and that I can come down for 4 days and babysit. \n\nBackground: my sister(26F) has been quite irresponsible up until most recently. She had her first son at the beginning of the pandemic(2020), and basically left my mom and I to take care of him most of the time. She would go out and hang with her friends for days while my mom and I practically raise him for the first two years of his life. My sister mostly provided for him financially. I was also taking the bar during that time so you can imagine what the results were when you\u2019re trying to study with a crying baby in the house. I eventually met my partner(30M) in 2021 and we moved in together in 2022 about 4 hours away from my family for his job. My sister recently had her 4 month old with her partner and has since taken her responsibilities as a parent seriously.\n\nThe reason why I think I may be the a-hole is because I am working remotely now and I have a lot of free time so technically I could do it. I just don\u2019t want to.", "created_utc": 1689008390, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14vzmcm/aita_for_telling_my_sister_no_when_she_asked_me/", "score": 251, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You are never required to babysit SOMEONE else\u2019s children. Period. It\u2019s selfish of HER and your mother to expect you to do so.", "Who leaves their 4 month old and 3 month old unless you have a wedding or something?  You don\u2019t get to leave your infant for 4 days for a getaway if you have no one to watch then.", "NTA. Just 'cause someone else decided to have kids doesn't mean you have to pay. No one asked you if they should have kids first. No one got you to guarantee, in advance, that you would look after someone else's kids at any point.\n\nThe kids are your sister's problem. If your mother has an issue with that, she can only volunteer herself, no one else.\n\nTBH I'd be LC/NC with both your sister and mother for a month or two... maybe more. You have the right to live your life as you see fit regardless of how others may view it. (Edited for judgment)", "NTA.\n\nIs no one else worried about leaving a 4 month old for 4 fucking days?", "NTA. Huge ask! We have 3 kids and don't expect anyone to do this for us. It would be nice, but nope. Not your problem.", "Mom and Sister: you are SELFISH \nOp: I DON\u2019T CARE!!\nThis is all you need to do. Do it. NTA", "NTA. I don't care if the reason is you wanna take a big shit on the 3rd Sunday of August and can't have kids around. Her kids are not your responsibility. You're mother seems to have an opinion, so why can't she look after them.", "NTA\n\nAnd maybe it\u2019s just me but I feel like leaving a 4 month old baby is neglectful. I left my 6 month old (at the time) with my mom for two hours and he was distraught when I got home. Poor guy. Haven\u2019t left him with anyone else because I felt so bad.", "Four months and a toddler for four days? NTA", "NTA. Not your baby, not your problem. You offered to pay someone, which is extremely generous.", "NTA. And please think of yourself as working full time even when it\u2019s from home. You\u2019re busy. And recovering from stress, which takes a physical toll. Communicate that: not that you have a lot of free time.", "NTA - while your job sounds all over the place, you don\u2019t need a reason to say no. You can say no just because you want to. Don\u2019t give her any reasons just say no, it\u2019s a complete sentence.", "NTA. Nobody is entitled to your time or effort, it is yours to give/trade/offer as you, and only YOU, see fit.", "So NTA\n\n\nIf you start taking these kids now next time it\u2019s a week, 10 days, then either longer or more frequent. Draw your boundaries now. \n\n\n\nYour mom does not get a vote on how you live. Did you vote on mom having 1 self-sufficient daughter and 1 needy daughter? I don\u2019t think so. There doesn\u2019t have to be 1 helpful and 1 not helpful daughter. There can be 2 not helpful daughters. BUT at least in your case you don\u2019t ask for help. You don\u2019t have your hand out. You shouldn\u2019t be called upon. \n\n\n\nRemember: You don\u2019t have to be better than your sister for approval. You don\u2019t need approval. That mentality is BS. \n\n\nThat being said most parents\u2019 of infants (4 months is still young) aren\u2019t going on 4 day vacations with their spouse and most likely not without their infant. Your sister did not earn this vacation. She wants it. She wants it at your expense and she won\u2019t even take you money. She wants you to sacrifice your own well being. When was the last time her life was interrupted because of you?  What sacrifices has she made for you?", "Would she be paying you for your time away from work and to travel to watch her young ones? She can\u2019t expect you to watch a newborn and a toddler as you work so you\u2019d have to take days off. Oh wait, more than likely not.\n\n\u201cCuz we\u2019re family!\u201d\n\nYeah and grandma volunteered her time for throwing in her unwanted opinion.\n\nNTA and keep saying no.\n\nNo one else cares about your well-being but you in this situation. Do what\u2019s best for your mental health after the hectic first half of the year you had.", "NTA", "This. You don't owe family babysitting. Period.\n\nBut, taking into account that one of the children is only 4 months old, you will (more than likely) be begging for that 5 hours of sleep you get during your busy months."]}
