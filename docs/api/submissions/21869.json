{"id": 21869, "submission_id": "14vzmcm", "title": "AITA for telling my sister no when she asked me to babysit for four days", "selftext": "I (28F) have a government job that is extremely intense during the first half of the year (Jan-June). It requires me to travel 3 hours to the state capitol every week on Mondays, stay in that city for a few days in a hotel, and then head back home on Thursdays (another 3 hour drive). Which means I'm in a car for 6 hours a week, in a hotel for three nights, and then have to repeat that every week for about 6 months. For the second half of the year I work from home. During the first half of the year I get about 5 hours or less of sleep a day, and sometimes I am working nights, weekends, or I am stuck in that hotel for a full week because work dragged on extra days past Thursday. Now that I am in the later half of the year, work is much lighter and I get to be at home, relax, and catch up on life. \nMy sister has two kids. One is a 4month old baby, and the other is 3. She asked me the other day if I could babysit her two kids for 4 days because she wants to go on vacation with her partner and needs someone to watch them. Bear in mind, I live 4 hours away from my sister. So I would have to either drive, or take a bus down. \nI am still so exhausted by the first half of the year that doing a long distance drive or bus ride feels awful. So I told her no. I told her I can't make it down, and I just want to relax. She thinks that I am being selfish because I have all this free time now and I don't want to help out. I told her that I would be willing to help her with money if she doesn't have any to pay a baby sitter. But she insists on me. She told our mom about it, and my mom agrees with her that I am being selfish and that I can come down for 4 days and babysit. \n\nBackground: my sister(26F) has been quite irresponsible up until most recently. She had her first son at the beginning of the pandemic(2020), and basically left my mom and I to take care of him most of the time. She would go out and hang with her friends for days while my mom and I practically raise him for the first two years of his life. My sister mostly provided for him financially. I was also taking the bar during that time so you can imagine what the results were when you\u2019re trying to study with a crying baby in the house. I eventually met my partner(30M) in 2021 and we moved in together in 2022 about 4 hours away from my family for his job. My sister recently had her 4 month old with her partner and has since taken her responsibilities as a parent seriously.\n\nThe reason why I think I may be the a-hole is because I am working remotely now and I have a lot of free time so technically I could do it. I just don\u2019t want to.", "created_utc": 1689008390, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14vzmcm/aita_for_telling_my_sister_no_when_she_asked_me/", "score": 28, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

No matter what your circumstances, you do not owe your sister babysitting and especially not for four days straight. Period. End of discussion.", "NTA. If your mum thinks your selfish why isnt she going and looking after them?\n\nJust because you have free time now doesnt mean you need to spend it on other people. Its yours to do as you please. \n\nAlso you are still working? I dont get this you are going to work and look after 2 babys at the same time for 4 days? Sounds like a nightmare.\n\nYour sister can take her kids, get a babysitter or not go at all. Kids arent just something you offload to other people whenever you feel like you wanna go on holiday.", "NTA. You don't owe anyone child care. If your mom thinks you're being selfish, why isn't she watching the kids?", "NTA\n\nno one has to babysit for anyone else's children.\n\n>One is a 4month old baby, and the other is 3.\n\nThe youngest is so young that presumably there is a high likelihood that they require a couple of feeds, possibly more, during the night. This is not a light commitment, this is full on parenting, and when I had a baby and a 2 Yr old it was absolutely exhausting.\n\nI'm sure your sister does need a break, but that's what her partner is for - to give the mother of an infant a break when they need it.  Not to put too fine a point on it, but she chose to have another baby, being knackered kind of comes with the territory, and there is absolutely no obligation for anyone else to take over their care.", "NTA. Nobody is entitled to your personal time to spend as *they* see fit. They don't know how tired you are. You offered to help with the babysitting costs -- that's plenty, that's an excellent compromise. They don't get to demand that no, *you* have to do it or tolerate being called names. \"Selfish\" doesn't mean \"not doing what I want.\" You've done enough to help her with her first child, and this \"but what have you done for me lately?!?!\" attitude shouldn't be allowed to get under your skin. Not wanting to drive 4 hours to babysit for 4 days is reason enough not to do it. Don't let them call you names.", "NTA\n\nDemanding someone travel 4 hours away to babysit for four days is ridiculous, even without taking into consideration that you\u2019re just barely out of the intense work portion of your year.\n\nYour sister and her spouse chose to have children and the burden of finding adequate childcare is on them. NO ONE else is responsible for dropping everything to run and take care of the kids bc mom and dad want to go on a vaca. \n\nSide note: if your job is any way related to a state legislature (it gives session vibes being in the cap three days a week), you\u2019ve MORE than earned some downtime to recover.", "NTA You didn\u2019t have the kids, your sister did. They aren\u2019t your responsibility! Also, offering her money to pay for childcare is literally the opposite of selfish. People need to learn that being family members does not necessitate providing childcare.

She can mind her own business", "NTA- I am not going to get into your sister\u2019s fitness as a mom. That\u2019s actually not relevant. Your work schedule makes this impossible right now. That\u2019s all you need right there.", "NTA\n\nFour days covers at least two work days, correct? And you can\u2019t wfh while taking care of two kids that young. So that means you need to use your PTO, correct?\n\nThat\u2019s not free time. That is part of your compensation for working.\n\nI suspect that your family thinks you can easily get your job done while at the same time caring for a newborn and an active toddler, but most jobs don\u2019t allow for that as you need time to get the work done.", "NTA.\n\nHer kids her responsibility.

Every person I know who has kids takes their kids on holiday with them. They're a family now and it's not reasonable of your sister to expect an adults-only vacation unless someone is actually offering to take her kids.  Noone is offering so it's not an option. It's all very well for your mum to say you're being selfish but she's obviously not volunteering to help out either and I'm guessing she lives much closer.  I'm not blaming her though as it sounds as if she helps out a lot already. I congratulate you for moving four hours away.  That's far enough away to stay out of their drama.  Your sister's request was unreasonable to begin with.  Doubling down on it is really out of order.", "NTA, you don't owe anyone babysitting.", "NTA. You don't owe anyone free babysitting. Especially if you don't want to.", "NTA. It would be different if this was an emergency.  But this certainty isn\u2019t. You do not owe her your time, especially having helped out with her older child. You have your life to live.", "NTA\nNot your kids!", "NTA. I think it's a perfectly reasonable request, but it's also a perfectly reasonable answer. I would certainly aim to help out a relative when possible (if nothing else, you never know when you might need a favour back), but I certainly wouldn't want to be pressured into anything I don't want to do, whatever the reason.\n\nNot sure about the particulars of your WFH job, mine for example would certainly not allow me to look after anything more needy than a cactus plant. Some people, however, seem to consider WFH as a semi-PTO, not sure if that may be the case for your sis.\n\nCertainly don't understand why you sister can't get a sitter, especially since you've offered to help cover the costs, or why your mom can't step up, since she seemed more than happy to volunteer you.", "NTA, you are being selfish and that's a good thing. Your health, both mental and physical, comes first. You can only help others when you are in a good place yourself, when you have time and energy to spare.

Doesn\u2019t anyone know how to mind their own business anymore?\n\nThe very few times my adult kids had disagreements, you know what I said if they called me? \n\n\u201cDo I look like a referee to you?\u201d \n\nOr if I was felling particularly grumpy- \u201cI\u2019m not a damn umpire! Get together and figure this crap out!\u201d\n\nThanks for letting me vent.", "NTA \n\nYou could be a kept woman, no job, chilling and she still wouldn\u2019t be owed childcare.", "NTA.  You don't have free time.  You are still working your job, just at a less frenetic pace.  Tell your mom to babysit her grandchildren if she has a problem with it.  You are four hours away.
