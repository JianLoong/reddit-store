{"id": 21869, "submission_id": "14vzmcm", "title": "AITA for telling my sister no when she asked me to babysit for four days", "selftext": "I (28F) have a government job that is extremely intense during the first half of the year (Jan-June). It requires me to travel 3 hours to the state capitol every week on Mondays, stay in that city for a few days in a hotel, and then head back home on Thursdays (another 3 hour drive). Which means I'm in a car for 6 hours a week, in a hotel for three nights, and then have to repeat that every week for about 6 months. For the second half of the year I work from home. During the first half of the year I get about 5 hours or less of sleep a day, and sometimes I am working nights, weekends, or I am stuck in that hotel for a full week because work dragged on extra days past Thursday. Now that I am in the later half of the year, work is much lighter and I get to be at home, relax, and catch up on life. \nMy sister has two kids. One is a 4month old baby, and the other is 3. She asked me the other day if I could babysit her two kids for 4 days because she wants to go on vacation with her partner and needs someone to watch them. Bear in mind, I live 4 hours away from my sister. So I would have to either drive, or take a bus down. \nI am still so exhausted by the first half of the year that doing a long distance drive or bus ride feels awful. So I told her no. I told her I can't make it down, and I just want to relax. She thinks that I am being selfish because I have all this free time now and I don't want to help out. I told her that I would be willing to help her with money if she doesn't have any to pay a baby sitter. But she insists on me. She told our mom about it, and my mom agrees with her that I am being selfish and that I can come down for 4 days and babysit. \n\nBackground: my sister(26F) has been quite irresponsible up until most recently. She had her first son at the beginning of the pandemic(2020), and basically left my mom and I to take care of him most of the time. She would go out and hang with her friends for days while my mom and I practically raise him for the first two years of his life. My sister mostly provided for him financially. I was also taking the bar during that time so you can imagine what the results were when you\u2019re trying to study with a crying baby in the house. I eventually met my partner(30M) in 2021 and we moved in together in 2022 about 4 hours away from my family for his job. My sister recently had her 4 month old with her partner and has since taken her responsibilities as a parent seriously.\n\nThe reason why I think I may be the a-hole is because I am working remotely now and I have a lot of free time so technically I could do it. I just don\u2019t want to.", "created_utc": 1689008390, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14vzmcm/aita_for_telling_my_sister_no_when_she_asked_me/", "score": 552, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
