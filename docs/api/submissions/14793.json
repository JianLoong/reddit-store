My wife (64F) and I have told her we would pay for her wedding like we did for all of our married kids and will do so if others get married. We like to grant our kids freedom in what they choose to do, but a recent conflict has her calling us a-holes.\n\nOur oldest (34F) has 4 kids, including a 13F trans daughter. We love our granddaughter and support her 100%. Our granddaughter has a boyfriend (13M), he\u2019s a great guy, very athletic, is on the baseball team and is active, helping our granddaughter get into fitness and offering to help her study. Our granddaughter recently asked him to go dress shopping with her to help her pick out a dress, she ended up picking some vintage Edwardian dress. She showed it to us with her boyfriend and he was complimenting her and she seemed to like it. \n\nOur daughter asked to see her niece\u2019s dress, saying she didn\u2019t trust her judgment because \u201cshe was probably just listening to her boy\u201d and said she had poor taste. I asked why she needed to see it but she wasn\u2019t giving an answer, I thought it was weird, let her see it and she just rolled her eyes at me.\n\nThe next issue came when our granddaughter wanted to invite her boyfriend to the wedding, our daughter insisted that we should invite everyone, friends, family, ect. We have invited second and third cousins, old friends from High School, ect. We mentioned to her that our granddaughter wanted to invite him, but she said no because he \u201cdoesn\u2019t respect authority\u201d. We asked her what she meant by this and she was talking about how his parents didn\u2019t want him to initially date her (because they were transphobic) but have since become more accepting. She said that kids should follow authority and based off that, if he can\u2019t follow his parents orders how can he be expected to behave at the wedding. I told her she sounded ignorant and like she was ok with the transphobia but she denied that. \n\nWe also asked her to let him come because he could spend the night away from his younger brother (11) who\u2019s far less accepting than his parents and is, from all I know, a massive jerk of a kid. My granddaughter's boyfriend says he doesn\u2019t even consider him a brother. Our daughter said she didn\u2019t care and said he needs to \u201cgrow up\u201d. She also made disparaging comments about him playing baseball rather than focusing on academics.\n\nAfter all of this, she was starting to complain online about how the wedding was causing her stress among \u201ccertain family members\u201d and it bugged us. We told her if she didn\u2019t delete the post, we would cut funds for her wedding. She said we were being self centered and called us self absorbed and we\u2019ve heard from a few other of our kids agreeing with her.

Are you saying you won't pay for the wedding you agreed to payoff because your daughter doesn't want to invite her niece's middle school boyfriend?", "YTA. Its her wedding and she should invite who she want. Why are you making your daughter wedding about your grandchild? You are a big asshole, you pay all of your children and said you will pay for hers. I hope that she cut all contact with you if you dont fund her wedding.", "YTA.  First, 13 year olds don\u2019t normal get plus ones to weddings.  Whether or not they want their current partner there is irrelevant.  \n\nSecond, a vintage Edwardian dress is not always appropriate for weddings and not trusting two 13 year olds to pick a dress for a formal occasion is not crazy.  Most 13 year olds have limited experience with weddings and wouldn\u2019t know what exactly is appropriate. \n\nThird, it\u2019s your daughter\u2019s wedding and if she doesn\u2019t want to invite an unrelated 13 year old who she barely knows and doesn\u2019t particularly like, that\u2019s her prerogative. \n\nThis wedding isn\u2019t about your granddaughter.  Stop making it about her.", "ESH. Your daughter is not being her most compassionate self to the 13 yr old boyfriend here, but you.. you\u2019re threatening to blow up her wedding for the sake of your daughter not wanting to invite the child boyfriend of her child niece. Both of these kids are pretty tangential to the main event, so why are you centering either one of them? You seem more concerned about the plus one of a person who wouldn\u2019t normally get a plus one than you are about your daughter and her wedding.", "Jeez, I know you're trying to show how much you support your grandkids being trans, but that doesn't make her boyfriend the main event of your daughters wedding! YTA.  It's her wedding, her 13 year old niwces boyfriend has zero business being there if she doesn't want him there, I've no idea how you think this kid is so important.", "YTA - guess who is the scapegoat in this family.", "YTA\n\nYou really want to throw down over a 13 year old boy, who is not in the family?", "I don't see an issue with a vintage dress. Some people like to dress like they're from another time. As long as it isn't white and can't be mistaken for a wedding gown. Not that I think anyone could mistake a 13 y.o for the bride. That would be weird. \n\nHowever YTA for pushing the wedding invite. \n\nIn what world does a child get to bring a +1 to a wedding? And why is this the hill you want to die on?", "*I have told her we would pay for her wedding like we did for all of our married kids and will do so if others get married.*\n\nYou can't use paying for her wedding as some sort of leverage. If you pay for all your kids, you should pay for her as well. If not, you're T A.\n\nYour daughter doesn't like her 13-year-old nieces BF and doesn't want to invite him. She's 13. Is it normal procedure in your country to give a 13-year-old a \"plus one\"?\n\n*We also asked her to let him come because he could spend the night away from his younger brother*\n\nWhy don't YOU, OP, invite the kid over to spend a night away from his brother instead of pushing your daughter to invite him for her wedding *in October* to give the kid a break from his home situation.\n\nYour daughter doesn't seem to trust her niece's taste in clothing. It almost sounds something like petty sibling rivalry, with niece being only 10 years younger than her aunt.\n\nInstead of holding something against her, try to communicate. And communication is a two-way street.\n\nESH", "OK while your youngest daughter doesn't sound like a very nice person--a quick google search of \"vintage Edwardian dress\" turned up hundreds of lovely dresses and not a single one appropriate for a guest at a wedding.  PLUS it's not customary for a 13 year old to get a plus 1 for a wedding.  As a parent I'd be disappointed in my child being transphobic given that she has a trans niece-- she's within her rights to not want her niece wearing an inappropriate dress to the wedding.    \n\n\nMild YTA to your for threatening to pull the funding for the wedding.  You are within your rights to do that but you'll be putting your daughter in a horrible situation and damaging your relationship with your daughter in a way that you will never be able to repair.  If you go that route prepare to be writing a post in two years about your youngest daughter, who doesn't speak to you just had a new baby that she won't let you see. \n\nIt's wonderful that you are supporting your granddaughter.", "YTA", "YTA. After spending enough time on this board I've become convinced that \"Wedding Induced Psychosis\" ought to be added to the DSM.\n\nIt seems common that parents who fund their kids' weddings use that generosity as a tool of control, which is an A move. If she doesn't want someone there, you should respect that wish; kids don't tell their parents everything, and she may have reasons you aren't aware of.\n\nBut as you describe them, her reasons include that she:\n\n* doesn't trust a 13 year old boy to pick out her daughter's dress at her wedding. \n* wants her daughter to be with a boy who does well in school. \n* wants her to have a bf who respects parental authority.\n\nNone of those seem outrageous to me. Plus, 13 seems a little young to me to necessitate a +1 at a wedding. She shouldn't have to justify it to you, and it doesn't sound like she is being transphobic toward her daughter despite your implying it. It just sounds like she doesn't like your daughter's boyfriend.\n\nYou asked her to let the bf come. She said no. You asked why. She told you why. You asked for an explanation for her why. She explained. You didn't like the explanation and you again asked her to let him come anyway. It's no wonder she's stressed.\n\nI suspect you are so eager to be supportive of your trans granddaughter (and that's awesome, good for you) that you are getting a little too meddlesome in their family business.", "So let me see if I understand the grave offenses your daughter has committed.  1.  She asked to see her nieces dress. 2. She didn't want to invite the niece's boyfriend to her wedding because she doesn't like him.  3.  She made a vague book post on Facebook complaining about the stress of wedding planning that you've decided to take offense at. \n\n\nAnd now you want to cut her off?  Okay. \n\nThat's your right, you don't have to pay for anything you don't want to. It's your money.  But don't threaten, do it. If you feel that strongly about it, just ttell her you aren't funding her wedding. \n\nShe's not a child.  Witholding privileges if they don't act \"right\" is ...childish at this stage.  Pay for it, or don't but don't threaten.  \n\nNAH  \n\nAlso, you don't seem to like your daughter that much.  Maybe she's picked up on that.", "I'm going to have to reluctantly go with ESH here. it is commendable that you are standing up for your granddaughter, and your daughter is the one behaving childishy, but weaponizing wedding expenses is an asshole move, in general.", "nta she is trying her  hardest to be a problem", "YTA.", "YTA funding the wedding doesn\u2019t mean you can tell her who she has to invite. Your jawing the money to dictate how her wedding needs to go. It\u2019s her wedding. You should give her the respect of planning her wedding.\n\nYour using money to control her which is so wrong. You are threatening her over not to want to invite some random 13 year old. Since when do 13 year olds get a plus one.  Most couples are starting to go child free. \n\nYou may want to cater to your grand daughter and that\u2019s your choice your daughter doesn\u2019t have too.", "NTA But leaning towards TA \n\nIt's great you support your grand daughter, but she is only 13 years old, she does not need a plus one to wedding.\n\nYour daughter that is getting married sucks though. \nDid she ask any of the other nieces to show their dresses or only the Trans one?\nShe seems to have alot of negative feelings towards your Trans grand daughter.\n\nShe also needs to realize that if you are funding the wedding that means you should be allowed to invite a few of the guests you as you paying towards the guest list.\nIf she has really invited everyone and their second cousin but is refusing to invite GD Boyfriend then she should pay all her own wedding costs.", "NTA. While written gently, it definitely sounds like your daughter is transphobic. You would be TA if you weren\u2019t paying for it, but asking for a few spots on the guest list that you are covering the cost for is very reasonable. If she wants no input from you, then she should be paying for it herself.", "Mild YWBTA for cutting the $. Mind you your daughter who is getting married is being a HUGE AH and Bridezilla with her attitude. But you have made a promise, and have said you want your children to have freedom to have the weddings they want. It would be best to stick to that promise. And then do something very nice for your niece and her boyfriend like taking them out to a very good dinner just before or after the wedding. And for extra points let your daughter know you are doing it.", "There is way too many negative votings on this. I'm gonna say NTA. \n\nMainly because if you want to cut out guests, pay for your own wedding. If someone's paying for it you're a bit expected to make compromises (UNLESS you absolutely hate said guest or if said guest has been shitty to you, the nieces bf is all around a good person and by all means a family friend, which is what a large part of the guest list sounds like.)\n\nThis wedding already sounds huge, so many people. Lots of friends and family. I doubt she would notice her niece and her bf, who by all means SHOULD be considered a family friend for going to bat with his bigoted family to protect her. \n\nHer comments are bigoted and I wonder if she truly accepts her niece. \n\n\nOfc yta if you're lying and the wedding is actually very small though. Felt the need to add that.", "I mean it's your money so you can spend it however you want. NTA. Your daughter sounds ungrateful tbh and that's not even touching her transphobia and crappy opinion about your granddaughters bf. Is she jealous of the attention your granddaughter is getting maybe?", "It seems like you're saying you're cutting off your daughter's wedding money for not fully supporting, and being sketchy as shit regarding your Trans niece?  If that's the case,  NTA!\n\nSupporting your Trans niece makes you *CORRECT* Nothing about being or not being an asshole. Respecting Trans kids is just CORRECT.", "NTA.\n\nLook, she\u2019s transphobic. The \u201clet me see the outfit, she doesn\u2019t have good taste\u201d is one of those classic slights mean women use on women they feel competitive with. It\u2019s glossed over with a veneer of \u201cbut I have your best interests at heart!\u201d when it\u2019s meant as anything but. \n\nI see two things going on here:\n\nFirstly, your daughter is threatened by the idea of your granddaughter\u2019s femininity. Whether she wants her to have a different experience because she\u2019s trans, thinks she shouldn\u2019t be allowed to be trans, or just has a personal issue with her specifically is something you\u2019d have a better handle on. She\u2019s targeting things like the dress and boyfriend because those are things she sees as feminine status symbols. Ugh, it feels dramatic to even type this, but I\u2019ve met many women who think this way, especially in their 20s. These are things she\u2019s competitive over, and for some reason she feels like your granddaughter shouldn\u2019t even participate in the \u2018competition.\u2019\n\nSecondly, she\u2019s targeting the boyfriend as a proxy to granddaughter. I\u2019m guessing you and other family members have been a unified front of support for granddaughter, and daughter realizes that if she goes any more directly for granddaughter you will have something to say about it. So instead, she hits on the boyfriend as he\u2019s not family (yet). I also think this is where the transphobia is really coming out. She may tell herself she\u2019s okay with granddaughter being trans, but she is NOT okay with a trans woman having a relationship with a cis man. (this is a really common issue for transphobics - they either feel the trans person is \u201cactually just gay\u201d or that the cis partner is perverse for some reason for engaging with the trans person.) She definitely agrees with the parents original line; she\u2019s literally stated that she feels he should have gone along with it. She sees his younger brother as in the right, and therefore has no sympathy for the boyfriends situation. She is going out of her way to make it as hard for him as she can. \n\n\nI think you need to be firm with her that the granddaughter and her boyfriend are guests you wish to be at the wedding, and you\u2019ll pay for them to be there. If she doesn\u2019t accept that, letting her fund her own wedding is acceptable.\n\nI told my mom something similar; she wanted to add a whopping 27 guests that I didn\u2019t know to our 60 person wedding. That was more than my husbands entire guest list! I told her no, and let her know that I would pay for the wedding myself if this was an issue for her. Loans exist, and weddings don\u2019t need to be so damn expensive anyways.", "Esh", "NTA, but almost\n\nIf you\u2019ve paid for the weddings of your other children, the issues you spoke about in your post seem pretty minor to suddenly cut off the funding.\n\nWeddings are quite complicated, I\u2019m surprised none of your other children had more important problems at their weddings.", "NTA Your daughter is acting ungrateful. Cut off the funds. Let her try and figure out how to do it alone. Then maybe she'll delete the posting and ease up on her niece and bf.", "NTA. I'm sorry, but your younger daughter does not sound like a very nice person. There seems to be a lot of thinly veiled transphobia coming from her. Wanting to support your great granddaughter is to be commended.", "NTA, it may be your daughters wedding but she\u2019s acting like a self righteous high school bully.

There are two separate issues here; one is potential transphobia (which is really hard to judge based on limited comments), or at least lack of compassion on the brides part towards the niece. That could be addressed at some point. But to put your foot down and threaten to not fund an entire wedding based on the invite of a 13 year old boy who isn\u2019t a relative and an \u201cEdwardian dress\u201d?

But you can't ignore the context.\n\nFirst of all, the thirteen year old boy did not pick out her dress. She did.

That's got nothing to do with her.\n\nAnd thirdly, yes respecting parental authority is good. But this kid 'disrespected' his parents by not letting their bigoted views prevent him from dating the granddaughter. This is a good thing. Someone who thinks he should have respected his parents bigoted views is, IMO, someone who likely shares those bigoted views.\n\nImagine this was about race.

These are all very strong assumptions about the bride and her motivation. The OP included the detail that their granddaughter is trans and appeared to imply that was a factor in the conflict. But literally all of these issues could have come up in the granddaughter was cis. We had a very small wedding and my adopted cousin\u2019s son (about the same age) invited his girlfriend without asking. That was frustrating to us because at that age, relationships come and go and it\u2019s not usually meriting a +1. Secondly, a lot of 13 year olds do not know appropriate wedding attire and need guidance from adults. A vintage Edwardian dress may not be appropriate and she wanted to check it out. Maybe it has something to do with her being trans, maybe the bride is just picky about the attire. There could definitely be some transphobia going on around the bride disapproving of the relationship based on the \u201crespecting authority\u201d comment, I\u2019ll give you that. But it\u2019s also possible that he is generally disrespectful and she doesn\u2019t like his attitude. I don\u2019t know if that is an example or a cis woman policing a trans girls relationship.

If I hears my niece was going to wear something that looked like a costume to my wedding then I'd ask to see it too.

My guess that\u2019s where her attitude toward your granddaughter is coming from. I wonder given that there is only a 10 year age difference how many times have you forced your daughter to cater to your granddaughter. How many times was your daughter made to babysit said granddaughter. Or play with said granddaughter. How many times did you push what your daughter wanted for your grand daughter! Given that you are willing to ruin your daughters wedding so your 13 year old grand daughter can get a plus one! My guess is quite a damn bit. \n\nUnlike you tried to suggest in the post I figure your daughter does have issues with your granddaughter. But it isn\u2019t because of her identity my guess is your daughter is tired of you making your granddaughter the center of everything and not being there for her!  my guess you brought up the granddaughters identity to make yourself into some big hero for standing up to your daughter for being a bully! Now your pissed because everyone seen though your bulls shit!\n\nYou are going to make sure you daughter wants no contact with any of your family. \n\nCongratulations you may be An amazing grandparents but you suck tremendously as parents!\n\n\n\nEdited:\n\nAfter googling the dress it absolutely confirms you and your wife are ass holes! Your daughter\u2019s attitude towards your granddaughter isn\u2019t about the granddaughter identity! It\u2019s about the fact you are purposely making the wedding about the granddaughter. If anyone needs proof they can just go google the dress you purchased! No wonder why the daughter wanted to view it! \n\nIf I was the daughter I would say no to the plus one for a 13 year old kid. And I would have said HELL NO to the dress! Stop trying to make your daughters wedding about your granddaughter!\n\n\n\nA link to anyone who wants to see an example of the dress op thinks is ok for the granddaughter to wear and was mad that his daughter wanted to see before she wore it to the wedding\n\nhttps://i.etsystatic.com/10574679/r/il/92b85e/1143245769/il_794xN.1143245769_5rue.jpg", "\"Why are they so involved on the family dynamic of a family who has been bigoted to their daughter?\"\n\nBuddy if you had a kid and they were dating a nice person but their family was hating your child just for existing I'm pretty sure you'd hear a lot about that family.\n\nMaybe if the bfs family weren't being shitty to their daughter they'd know a lot less of them.

His daughter will never forgive him--but if OP is okay with trashing that relationship he's free to do that.", "Ah, you're right, I did misread that. I thought we were talking about her daughter and not her niece. \n\nI don't think it would change my vote, but I would be super curious to hear what the eldest daughter (trans daughter's mom) thought about this situation and the bf.

If you remove the trans issues, why would anyone expect a minor child to get a date? That\u2019s really not the norm.  It also doesn\u2019t sound like all the other kids are bringing dates - the other people OP mentioned being invited are adults.\n\nI\u2019ll go ESH because the brides reasons are sketchy.  But, if she just said - minors don\u2019t get +1s, that would be totally reasonable.", "This isn\u2019t the fact how the bf family is or isn\u2019t.\n\nThe fact of the mater is op\u2019s daughter isnt asking for a childfree wedding (to be honest she may want to ask to nip this in the bud) she is asking for some random 13 year old not to be invited.\n\nBut op and his wife is dangling money over the daughter to get her to tow the line and do what they tell her or they won\u2019t pay.\n\nSince when does a 13 year old child get a plus one?

She doesn\u2019t want him at her wedding because his parents were against him dating a trans person, and have since changed their mind, and daughter thinks he should have never gone against their wishes and should not be dating a trans person. \n\nGiving THAT reason to not invite a specific person, whom you won\u2019t even be paying for?

I personally dont like that either but i wouldnt outright punish a kid just for wanting a date lol. If kids in family are dating young, the family is usually very involved because who else is going to be driving them to dates and supervising them? \n\nI'm all for childfree weddings and such personally, but it doesn't really seem like them being children is the problem here as that's not what the bride mentioned.", "I agree that if that's her only reason, then she sucks. But that's still begging the question of why does she owe her father an explanation in the first place? \n\nI think a 13 year old bringing a date to a wedding is weird regardless of gender identity. This would be very different I think if we were talking about, say, an 18-20 year old in a serious relationship.", "Well, those are the bride and groom's extended family.  And the bride and groom's high school friends.\n\nInviting them doesn't mean giving anyone and everyone a plus one.  I see abaolutely no reason why a 13 yr old needs a plus one to a wedding.\n\nLike I think the bride should not be singling out the 13 yr boy to exclude.

I'm sure there will be looks and whispers about the trans granddaughter because unfortunately not everyone has become accepting of such things.

They're lucky she's letting her wear it.", "It seems to me that you, your spouse, and grandchild all have the disrespectful attitude toward your daughter, the bride, who gets to invite who she wants to her wedding and gets to choose the aesthetic.

From the time I was 10 my parents pushed me aside for the baby. They missed special events due to my neice.  I was made to watch my neice for free. I was forced to play with my neice.
