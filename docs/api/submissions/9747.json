I called Marie and told her I'd be cutting her line off at 5pm unless she came up with a way to pay (the bill for Marie's line was $50/month.)\n\nI did not hear from her so I then went and disconnected Marie's eSIM online.

For what? You're ungrateful because you refused to be taken advantage of? Why can't your gf open her own account and add her friend and pay for it? NTA.", "NTA.  They just tried to put you on the hook for something they shouldn't have any right to do yet you would be financially responsible for without even bothering to ask you, let alone get your permission- doesn't strike me as a particularly ethical or legal move on their part.  And between that & Laura's reaction to not letting her unilaterally stick you with Marie's phone bill is a major red flag, assuming this relationship lasts much longer.\n\nThough might be a good idea to double-check your financials & credit reports, as well as changing your passwords, to make sure that Laura hasn't done anything else like this, or give herself a parting gift on her way out the door....", "NTA run.

She now sees it as something she's entitled to. As bad of a situation as that is it's nowhere compared to her expecting the same for her friend!\n\nYou are clearly being used my man. Next time don't lead with your money and frankly besides paying for dates, don't pay for anything else until you are married. And I'm fairly confident this is the case because you mentioned that you've been dating for 3 years and that you've been paying for her phone which was added to your wireless plan, for the same amount of time.\n\nI'd also be concerned how she was able to make changes to the plan that is in your name and that you pay for. The only thing that makes sense is if you gave her your login information gave her  privileges to make changes to your account. The accounts in your name and you pay for it, which means you're the one who's liable. Giving her such privileges is not a smart move", "NTA. Your gf should pay for it if she wants to help HER friend.\n\nI pay $20 for my TracFone. Maybe she should have gone that route.", "This may sound bad but change the locks on the doors and tell her she needs to pay half in order to have a key.  Maybe that will enlighten her not to make decisions without consulting you.", "NTA\n\nDoes this seem like a typical thing that you would have done if asked?  Pay for your GF's friend's phone bill since she is in a bind?", "NTA. And change your account password and passcode so she can\u2019t make account changes. Marie or Laura pays or it\u2019s gets shut off, that\u2019s completely reasonable.", "NTA .  Laura should have spoken with you about this, preferbly before adding Marie to the phone plan.

Completely disrespectful.", "Laura didn't get your consent to add her friend to your phone plan, and expected you to pay for it. Nta", "NTA. She could\u2019ve talked to you about adding Marie and worked out how to split the cost. She could\u2019ve paid the extra $50 herself, or split it with Marie.

Now she\u2019s pouting because her little ploy didn\u2019t work.\n\nHonestly, she should be grateful you aren\u2019t telling her to get her own account after this stunt. You should at the very least revoke her ability to make changes, since she clearly can\u2019t be trusted.", "NTA.
