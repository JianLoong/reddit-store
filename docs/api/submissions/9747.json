(Look what she did with your phone line). And if that happens tell her you\u2019ll be calling the cc company and disputing the charges and telling them your card was stolen- which she would have done. (She doesn\u2019t need your card she could write the #/exp date/cvv code down and use to purchase online). - had This happen to me.\n\nedit to add - why didn\u2019t your gf just pay for Marie to get her own line and not use your money? Notice how gf is very free with your money and not her own.", "NTA\nI mean, how dare you be ungrateful for involuntarily having 50$ a month stolen from you from an illegally activated phone line.", "NTA. She could have at least come to you and said \u201cMarie\u201d is struggling right now, can we help her out instead of just burdening you with an extra 50 bucks a month.", "NTA\u2026 she\u2019s sneaky and thought you\u2019d never find out. You\u2019ll just keep paying the phone bill. Hell no\u2026. She never consulted with you on this either. She can stay at her friends for all I care. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "INFO: Why did she call you ungrateful? Has Marie helped you out with something in the past? Or did Laura help a friend of yours with something?", "What are you saying?  People should not buy things until they can afford them?  Are you crazy??? /s", "Bingo.  I knew a young couple discussing getting married and as part of that they talked about finances.  They were discussing the pros and cons of having separate bank accounts.  Her exact words were \"We can't do that.  I might run out of money.\"  She did not even think that maybe he might run out of money.  She then made matters even worse by telling him that if she ran out of money and had to get her nails done, what would she do?\n\nAnd yes, he ran for the hills.", "NTA it\u2019s weird that she is slinging you so much attitude about it after telling you when you asked if they\u2019re going to pay for it,\u201d no neither of us is paying for it.\u201d", "Right here. This is a symptom of bigger behaviors, IMO.", "Come now, you know hers is more magical than everyone else's.", "One he should be GRATEFUL for \ud83d\ude44", "OP should be grateful for the opportunity to pay her friends phone bill", "He THINKS everything has been 50-50.  I bet she has got some other scams going on.  Like going to the grocery store with their credit card and getting cash back and passing if off as part of the bill.  I can think of many ways she could have been using him that he is not aware of.", "The real question is what kind of GF asks her BF to help out HER friend for free? Especially since the GF would not be helping out with the bill AT ALL.  Isn't there a word for taking money from a man in this manner?", "$50 a month to add a line is huge, too. I thought by now most plans let you add a line for $10 per month.  That she might have been able to sneak past him (good for her, bad for him...)", "You underestimate the stupidity of others. The *last* thing those two criminal masterminds thought of was \u201cHe\u2019ll see the bill increase\u201d.", "Mitochondria is plural, mitochondrion is singular, so it's \"the mitochondrion is the powerhouse of the cell\" and all our middle school science classes were incorrect.\n\nYes, I am popular at parties.", ">People pleasing girlfriend\n\nOnly pleasing some people, not OP obviously", "And change all of your passwords. Lock your phone.\n\nI'm sorry. From this story, it appears Laura doesn't care about your feelings, only your money.", "You don't need to pay for a new phone if the phone you have is compatible with their system or unlocked.  All you need is the cell phone company's SIM card to place inside your phone.", "She said something about you being ungrateful.  Is there something she or Marie did for you that she may think is worth paying for her phone?  You also say you pay some bills and she pays the others, if you add them all up is she paying more usually?  Grasping at straws here.", "Maybe it also included a payment plan on a new phone?", "Ding, ding, ding. We have a winner.\n\nOP is ungrateful for their mere presence in his life by refusing to be a sucker that pays for their crap.\n\nIn addition, if friend couldn't pay her own phone bill, sounds like she racked up a lot of charges, her credit is probably in the dumpster and she can't get her own phone plan. So she's a risk on his plan. \n\nNo thank you. OP needs to removed account authorization from GF, since she obviously had it and can't be trusted with it, and ensure that she didn't give it to friend as well so she can't go out and buy a new thousand dollar phone or something. And then consider how this reflects on her character.", "This!", "If you have another adult on your mobile line the phone company always asks the account holder if they want the other adult to be authorized to make changes to the phone plan or not. When he set up his girlfriend\u2019s line he must have given her authorization or they would not have allowed it. They won\u2019t even allow spouses to make changes without being authorized by the account holder. \n\n\nSo its not legally fraud if she had prior permission to make changes to the account. It\u2019s like giving someone a credit card in their name on your line of credit, just with the phone company. \n\n\nI hope he removed his girlfriend as an authorized account manager or she could still go get herself and her friend brand new iPhones and watches on a payment plan right now.", "And I love how she was like \u201cWe\u201d are helping Marie out when there was going to be no WE paying", "And make sure she is removed from the account. If she still has access to the account it won't matter that OP cut off her phone line.", "Very good point; Laura should have her own phone account since she can't be trusted with the OP's.", "'Ungrateful' as in \"I'm having sex with you, so let me do whatever I want with YOUR resources.\"\n\nHard no.", "That\u2019s what I was like wtf I would\u2019ve dumped her on the spot and took her off", "You have a good point! Definitely remove her off the account completely and change password.", "Still dishonorable as all hell.", "Indeed. I get unlimited talk and text, with 12gb of data, per month, for less than $26 USD. \n\nIf his girlfriend \u201cdeigns\u201d to speak to him again, he should tell her to get her friend on a [MVNO.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_virtual_network_operator)\n\nAlso, NTA .", "This is definitely what she meant", "Yeah we were able to call and give a one time authorization for my SIL to upgrade her phone and we set it up where she could go in and pay her part of the bill. We thankfully never had issues with her.", "Aw, c'mon, nobody'll \\*follicle\\* for that! ;-)", "Crabs are a butter delivery mechanism....LOL.", "Yeah, he needs to cut Laura off too\u2026"]}
