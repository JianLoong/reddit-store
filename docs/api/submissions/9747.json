NTA she shouldn\u2019t have added anyone without consulting with you first.", "NTA", "NTA - and probably single now too... not that that's a bad thing. Run dude, run.\n\nAnd if you're the account holder, you can see Laura's phone records... you may decide that you want to cut her line as well. Get a $20 flip phone from Walmart and call some of the numbers... dollars to donuts, her side piece will be one of the numbers. Then once all the dust has settled, you can give Marie the flip phone as a thank you gift.\n\nCHANGE ALL YOUR PASSWORDS NOW", "NTA unless there's something I'm missing, big time. Why is your girlfriend calling you ungrateful? Has Marie done lots of nice things for you? Helped you out in emergencies? That kind of thing? If so, a case could be made that it's a nice thing to reciprocate and help her out but that should be a decision you and your girlfriend make together not a decision your girlfriend makes unilaterally for you. I love her phrasing of \"we\" are helping Marie out when she doesn't plan to pay any part of Marie's bill, and just expects you to roll over and pay it! Good grief.", "YTA\n\nYou needed to discuss this with your gf\n\nIf she wanted to cover Marie, that was her choice\n\nBut you made only Marie involved\n\nHonestly you made her look like a shitty friend for $50.", "Op=NTA Ops GF=AH", "You're being used/taken advantage of. Your gf doesn't respect you, your money or boundaries and feels entitled. She belittled you when you brought it up, she guilt tripped you for not \"helping out\" someone in supposed need when she had no conversation with you prior. Would you ever do that  to a friend? Let alone someone you're meant to call a partner. \nI find it disheartening that you bad to ask strangers this. I hope the future looks brighter for you.", "NTA - what. This is so strange.", "I think taking money without permission is the definition of theft. No matter how big or small the amount. NTA.", "Might want to consider new locks", "Ungrateful? How? What do you owe Marie?\n\nNTA. Frankly it sounds like your gf thinks you aren't that smart, like you wouldn't notice that extra charge on the account. Furthermore they both sound entitled af. Why do you owe Marie $50 a month? I don't get it. None of this makes sense and it's pissing me off.", "NTA - She couldn't of asked or even simply let you know ahead of time?\n\nTotally ridiculous. lol.", "NTA, but your girlfriend is. So she adds an extra line to YOUR plan, claims that \u201cwe\u201d are helping her friend because it\u2019s \u201cnot a big deal\u201d? And then calls you the \u201cungrateful\u201d one?? If it\u2019s not a big deal, she can pay for her friend herself. \n\nThere are a lot of \u201cungrateful\u201d people here. You aren\u2019t one of them. \n\nAbsolutely the most cut dry NTA I\u2019ve ever read on this sub. \n\nNow, break up with your girlfriend immediately. She is a toxic mess and you need to be free of it.", "NTA.  You need to immediately freeze your credit with your credit bureaus and ask them to flag them for potential fraudulent transactions, change ALL your passwords and challenge questions: email, social media, anything at all that\u2019s financial, and completely log out of everything, clear your cache and cookies (make note of your accounts, etc., first if you don\u2019t have the info but keep it encoded and vague - if I store my username for something I would write it as, say \u201ccic~s\u201d and my password as maybe the first and second digits or letters plus the last one, enough to tell me what it is but not how long it is, etc.).  Hard reboot your computer (good time to do any security updates too), and log back into only the things you need, and set up 2FA for everything you can.  It\u2019s fucking annoying, but it helps.  Good luck.", "NTA! Omg, the AUDACITY!! They were straight up using you and now you gf has the nerve to be mad that you won\u2019t pay for her friend?! That would be a dealbreaker for me. I\u2019d be changing the locks.", "> She said neither of them would as we were \"helping out Marie for a bit, she couldn't pay her old phone bill anymore\". I called Marie\n\nINFO: Wait, why did the conversation end here? Did you lose your tongue? \n\nthe non-asshole move would've been to explain that you're sorry but you don't want to pay towards her/don't have the money/whatever, and keep the discussion going about how you feel she shouldn't undertake such an action regarding your money without your consent, and that if she does want to do this she should probably be the one paying the bill out of her own pocket. Then you keep this conversation going until you figure out a resolution together. Only if no resolution is forthcoming, the mature thing to do would be to tell your GF \"okey, we disagree here, but i still don't want to pay, so i'm going to call Marie and tell her i'll cancel it unless she pays\".\n\nOf course your girlfriend is going to be mad, you went behind her back to cancel it even though you knew that her friend was in need. Yes, she was an Asshole in the first place for doing it without talking to you, but you were just as wrong to cancel it without finishing the conversation.

If Marie can't afford $50 a month she's in deep trouble", "And what the heck is she talking about when calling him \"ungrateful\" lol.....yeah, I'd be ungrateful too if someone made phone bills in my name without telling me lol.....wow, some people!!", "Exactly! NTA. Not only didn't they tell you, your GF finds it normal *you* pay for *her* friend. Last time I checked, your friend's bills aren't part of the bills payed by your joint account (if you have one, that is). If your GF had *any* decency, she would at least pay it herself.", "For only stealing 50 dollars per month, maybe? NTA. This is concerning behaviour from the GF too.

No telling what else has occurred.", "NTA.\n\nThe way this is supposed to work is they should have asked first BEFORE adding the phone line to your plan. There should have been a discussion on how long you would have been helping her out for free, and once she got back on her feet, how she would pay you back. Only after those talks, if you felt comfortable with the terms and conditions, and everyone was on the same page (and if you had it agreed in writing), THEN you add her to the phone plan.", "With her shifty behavior and how she's handling getting caught, I would honestly find it hard to trust her with past, present and future matters.

I\u2019m not justifying what GF did but not having phone access is a pretty big deal these days and my mind isn\u2019t among those leaping to fraud, stolen identity, etc. Its certainly a presumptuous move at best but if Marie is fallen on hard times she also cannot now search/apply for jobs, take a ride share to a job interview, have a phone job interview, etc. I\u2019m just thinking of how Marie gets fucked here and she didn\u2019t do anything wrong. She probably thought this arrangement was legit and waiting a day to be able to let her know she suddenly will be cut off isn\u2019t really any worse off for OP. Good luck with this, its certainly a very awkward situation", "The ungrateful threw me for a loop too.", "What did the GF think would happen when he saw the bill had gone up by $50?\n\nShe had to know he would see it and question it.\n\nWhy wouldn't she tell him about it when she did it? He still would have been right not to pay for it and have it shut off, but not even telling him (much less discussing it before adding it) is highly suspect.", "The mitochondria is the powerhouse of the cell . . . phone.", "I mean it\u2019s worth actually asking why she made that comment. Is there an expense she\u2019s been covering, do they owe Marie a significant favor?

The whole \"oh, it's okay\", when the other person very clearly did NOT say it's okay? Infuriating.", "That\u2019s what I was thinking too. This is something that has been caught out.

Make sure your girlfriend has no access to that account or any other accounts in your name.", "I bet she would have ran up a big bill for you to cover.", "Oh, so they snuck it on there and hoped you wouldn't notice. Pretty shitty of them. If you never noticed, I wonder if she would have even mentioned it.", "Who paid for the phone itself?", "And that knowledge is the *perfect* starting point for a conversation about respecting each other, not going behind each others back, finances, etc. and figuring out a way to make this work. Hell, since there was already a conversation going, it would have cost OP no extra time to announce \"well i disagree, i'm going to call Marie to cancel it\".\n\nThe lack of conversation is terrible from both sides. doesn't excuse the girlfriend, but OP only made it worse, and this way they're heading straight for a breakup, rather than even trying to figure out how to make things work.", "start paying attention to your grocery bill to see if she's buying groceries for her friend.
