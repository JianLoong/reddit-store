Invite them to something else-cake tasting, etc.", "Yikes NTA- and you need to nip this one on the bud before their behavior defines a dynamic for the rest of your life with this man. The details of how you handle this are totally up to you. But here\u2019s how I would go about it. \n\n1. Inform your fianc\u00e9e that you will be reasonable with his family but that you need him to respect your boundaries and back you up. \n\n2. Reply firmly back to the in-laws that you will dress shopping the way you want to and that their treatment of you is hurtful and inappropriate. \n\n3. (Optional but recommended if you want to salvage this situation) tell the in-laws that you do want to get to know them better and you absolutely consider them family. Invite them to a cake tasting, or to pick out the flowers, or ask them for advice on hair and makeup. Really anything else besides the dress. \n\nIf you are firm with your boundaries but extend the olive branch now you are doing everything you can. Try to do it over text and take screenshots. If they come around, great. If they continue to treat you like dogshit- it\u2019s a gotcha moment. Now you have a legitimate reason to decline a relationship with them. And make sure your fianc\u00e9e understands he needs to take your side in this. If he doesn\u2019t a big part your marriage will be miserable.", "Nta your wedding your choice", "A dad of 2 adult girls here. While I have not gotten to the wedding planning stage yet (we start with our oldest in 2 months) I would think you want people there who you are comfortable with and not judge you. Future MIL and SIL don\u2019t seem to be the kind of people you want. I would hate to think they would make snide or condescending comments.", "Texts about how awful you are is an enormous red flag. I assume these two wanted to bond with you and felt hurt, but jumping to attack is insane. NTA just for that fact.", "NTA - wedding dress shopping is a very intimate thing. \n\nI went with just my mom and couldn\u2019t have imagined inviting my MIL. We did invite my MIL to look at venues with us, so I felt that was a nice way to include her opinion.", "Nta. \nI was a bridesmaid and wasnt even part of wedding dress shopping - because the bride wanted it to be a surprise to everyone. She literally only took her mom because her mom offered to pay for it, otherwise she would have gone alone. \nChoosing a wedding gown is as personal as giving birth, in my opinion. It is about you and you only. And you alone get to say who should be with you for that. Because its an event most women think about since they can grasp the concept - even if they are apposed to marriage. We all think about that \"once in a lifetime outfit\".", "NTA\n\nAlthough it wouldn\u2019t hurt to be inclusive and a tad more gracious to your future MIL and SIL", "NTA.\n\nShopping for the dress is a deeply personal moment, or it is where I am. It's fairly common for mums, siblings, or friends to be there. In-laws can be invited based on your relationship.", "NTA I invited my SIL along with my Mom and sister to wedding dress shop with me. MIL gave my fianc\u00e9 a ton a grief about it. I told my fianc\u00e9 if he kept pressing me on it he could have one woman mad at him or two. I was not inviting her and he wised up and shut up about it.\nYou only need the people there who you feel the most supported by.", "ESH- I understand you\u2019re not close, but two hours is not a huge distance, so I\u2019d probably assume that once you\u2019re married you will get closer, even if you don\u2019t become great friends and it\u2019s only as a byproduct of spending more time together. You\u2019re in no way obligated to offer, but it would have been nice to invite this woman, who happens to be your future MIL to go along with you to try on dresses- again, she\u2019s going to be a part of your life, so why not make it a pleasant experience and try to bond a little bit? however, his sister calling you a name and throwing a fit about the situation was totally rude and inappropriate. Y\u2019all should maybe try to begin again, acknowledge some mistakes were made, and have a fresh start.", "NTA. It is 100% your choice who you include in your wedding planning. Some of these decisions are intimate, maybe emotional, and YOU get to decide who you want to be around for those moments. The fact that they are berating you is very concerning - have they tried to insert themselves into your relationship often? I'd keep an eye out for that behavior going forward.", "Need more information.  Did your future sister-in-law really call you an AH or did she say that they were hurt that they weren't included?  There is a really big difference!  It sounds like Tyler is close to his family as they seem to have regular family dinners and have included you.  So, unless they are overly pushy, why not include them in a few things.  This could be a real bonding time for you all.\n\nI have two adult sons.  Although neither is close to getting married, I would love to be included in the dress shopping when the time comes.  Most of my friends have been invited to go dress shopping when their sons got engaged.  They all arranged for lunch at a really nice restaurant during the middle of the day and picked up the tab as a thank you.", "NTA\n\nThey can say they care and are there if you need them, but being rude to you about it is immature. \n\nIf I were the mom or sister I would just invite you somewhere lighthearted for an afternoon and get to know you better. Try to make you start feeling more comfortable.\n\nIt just sounds like they took it as an intentional insult. But they might not really understand that you don't feel super comfortable with them alone yet. \n\nHave you had a chance to explain or text them saying that it wasn't meant to be hurtful?", "NTA\n\nWedding planning is already stressful enough. You don't need your soon-to-be in-laws creating more drama/issues. I suppose you could have spent time with them before everything already happened, or invited them as a nice gesture, but that ship has already sailed. I'm happy that Tyler agrees with you and only wants you to enjoy shopping. It is unfortunate that it sounds like his mom and sister already made their mind up about you. Be careful if they choose to be petty.", "NTA! no one is entitled to being a part of such a special moment for you, family or not. i\u2019m not sure what they are trying to accomplish by harassing you and i\u2019m sorry you\u2019re going through this! don\u2019t let them bully you into letting them push your boundaries!", "NTA - you are not joining her family.  You and your fianc\u00e9 are leaving your family\u2019s of origin to create a new family unit.  You are the fianc\u00e9e of her son.  She is not your bonus mom and you are not her bonus daughter.  Genesis 2 24 - therefore the man shall leave his father and his mother and cleave to his wife, becoming one flesh.\n\nYou invited whomever you want to the wedding dress shopping.  This is for you to pick out your dress.  You don\u2019t invite people you don\u2019t know well yet, it is not your job to host them.\n\nMIL already had her wedding and raised her kids.  It\u2019s you and your fianc\u00e9\u2019s turn.  He needs to have the conversation with his mom and sister about not overstepping on the bride\u2019s stuff.  You and fianc\u00e9 need to decide how you would like them to be involved.  You are a team, you discuss and decide together how you want to deal with them, and then fianc\u00e9 has the conversation with them because they are his family.", "NTA \n\nYour wedding, your dress, and you call the shots. If you prefer to not have them there, you don't have to. Not everyone likes to turn wedding dress shopping into an event. \n\nYour fianc\u00e9 needs to tell his family to back off. They are out of line to harass you and call you names. Why isn't he protecting you from them?", "NTA ?? I don't get why they're so entitled. I'd get it if you were somewhat close to them, but from what you said it seems like you are not. They have no reason to feel entitled to be there.", "NTA\n\nMaybe I'm oblivious to contemporary practices, but why in the world would the GROOM's family have the slightest input about your wedding dress?  It seems to me, perhaps naively, that it's none of their business.", "It\u2019s your wedding so it\u2019s your hill to die on.\n\nThat being said, expect this to negatively impact your relationship with them. If you don\u2019t care, then you have nothing to worry about. If you do, pick something that they can participate in without getting on your nerves too much and invite them.", ">His mom and sister have been sending me texts saying how awful I am for not inviting them\n\nNTA - By their deeds you shall know them....", "NTA obviously but it is always nice if you are ok to try and include people or just ask if they would like to come.  No one is entitled but to me you will be around them for a long time so sometimes these goodwill gestures mean a lot.", "Would it have been nice for you to invite them? Sure. Can they be disappointed and voice they would have liked to attend? Sure. But once they started being hostile and throwing curses around that gets them excluded. NTA. His mom and sister are and he needs to shut their behavior down or he's an AH, too, for letting them talk to you like that.", "NTA - The way they are behaving with the insults and nasty texts kinda proves you were right to not invite them.", "NTA. Nobody came with me wedding dress shopping because I didn\u2019t want anyone with me. Who you choose or if anyone comes, is completely up to you. This is your wedding, not there\u2019s, so nobody but you and your fianc\u00e9 are the only ones who get a say in anything!", "Sure. It\u2019s your wedding. But play the long game here. Are you always going to be distant? What role will his family be playing in your life? If you plan to have kids, how close will they be?\n\nYou don\u2019t want them to think you\u2019re inconsiderate before you even get a chance to really join the family. \n\nJust decide if this is a hill you want to die on.", "I get wedding dress shopping is a very personal experience for the Bride. I get it, have two daughters.  With that said, you are marrying into his family.  They will be your family once you say I do.  Are you not close with his family because of something that happened or because you don't see them a lot due to the distance?  Has it been a lack of trying on both sides to do things without Tyler and your future in laws?  You mention not wanting to put Tyler in the middle but that is what you done.   You need to do you. It is stressful for everyone.  Is there a way to compromise and make this into a win/win solution?", "NTA\n\nWhere I live, few women take their MIL wedding dress shopping, so I don\u2019t blame you for not thinking about it\n\nBut for your future SIL to call and say you\u2019re an AH for not inviting their mom is way beyond acceptable.  And then they text you both??WTF.\n\nYou and Tyler need to discuss how he\u2019s going to deal with this.

I wanted to make sure it fit perfect into the \u201cvibe\u201d if that makes sense. And then the venue had a wedding planner that did a lot of the planning for us.", "This. Even a simple small olive branch could really salvage everyones relationships and the peace the day of. This is very excellently worded! Wish I could give ya a billion upvotes and awards.", "This!! Especially since they\u2019re texting her about how awful she is!! Absolutely not.", "I can see not inviting to dress shopping...but do agree she should at least try to include his side in SOMETHING. I've seen first hand (and second hand) where it can damage the grooms relationship with his immediate family to not at least include in...say helping set up decorations. Even just that small thing alone could help foster a healthy balance.", "So much this. It takes so little to try and reach out to your (the bride\u2019s) future family.  The same people saying this is \u201cthe bride\u2019s wedding\u201d will also turn around and complain about obnoxious/self-centered brides. A wedding is bringing two families together, not including the groom\u2019s family in some portion of the planning is short sighted and will set the stage for future issues.\n\nETA: I wish I had an award to give!", "I wasn\u2019t there but Tyler did tell me she called me an AH during the conversation. He\u2019s very close to his family so I know he wouldn\u2019t say it if it wasn\u2019t true. I could tell he didn\u2019t even really want to tell me that part. They usually try to do a family dinner once a month. \n\nRight now dress shopping is going to be me my sister my mother and my godmothers. All the women who shaped me into the woman I am. \n\nWe talked about possibly including them in something else but everything else has been booked. The only thing left we have to do is finalize songs and things like that. The venue had a wedding planner help us with a lot of things.", "Exactly! I can understand not inviting to dress shopping. That is intimate and she may simply not want many to know what the dress is. But I can't tell you how much even just being able to help a little will go a long way! Even if it's just helping set up decorations!   \n\n\nI know my mom would've been completely fine if my brother's wedding she was allowed to at least help put up decorations, but since she wasn't allowed to even help with that (his wife's mom wouldn't let anyone help) it really put a strain on their relationship for 10 years now, though it is getting better. For the longest time, it made my mom feel like he always put his in-laws above us, and that his wife was keeping him from his family.  \n\n\nThey..mostly worked through it? There still is some strain but it used to be a LOT worse!", "[deleted]", "When did dress shopping invites become the harbingers of in-law relationships? If OP\u2019s MIL & SIL make this a thing that takes away from the joy from the celebration of their son\u2019s/brother\u2019s love with his new wife - that\u2019s a \u201cthem\u201d problem. They should journal about that shit and leave OP alone. In any event, OP shouldn\u2019t pay no more than 50 cents & an essential oils MLM coupon towards caring about it & go on being blissfully happy.", "No kidding! I can\u2019t imagine the amount of tiptoeing you\u2019re going to have to do around these two.", "Right? Maybe if the sister had just said they feel hurt and left out, then OP could have invited them, but going straight to AH (wtf?) made that impossible. For me, this whole dress shopping as one more Wedding Event thing feels pretty new as a tradition (I don't recall anyone really doing this 20+ years ago but maybe they did and I didn't notice) so I feel like there cannot be hard and fast rules you must follow.", "She hasn\u2019t gone yet.", "We\u2019ve pretty much done everything just the two of us.", "Does it matter? It's not their wedding.", "This \u2b06\ufe0f. If someone calls you an AH right out of the gate\u2026.", "I understand. See if you can do a \u201cwalk through\u201d or something with them. There is nothing worse than hurt feelings at the start of a marriage.", "Why is it a problem not to include them in the planning?   Plenty of couples plan weddings without the families involvement.", "How is it a problem? It's not their wedding, she isn't required to include anyone else in the decisions.", "She can do whatever she wants. It\u2019s reasonable to assume, though, if they are upset about not being included, it may have a negative effect on her relationship with them. I\u2019m not saying whether it is right or wrong. I\u2019m just making a logical assumption.", "Personally I feel that choosing a wedding dress is something you do with your Mum, sisters, best friends even favourite aunts. Unless your extremely close to your future MIL I would never dream of inviting them to go wedding dress shopping.", "You are NTA for not including them in dress shopping...But maybe try to consider his immediate family some. After all, the wedding is for him too, so they are probably simply just reacting out of feeling pushed out and hurt.\n\nI say this as someone who was the sister and our mother shut out from helping with my twin brother's wedding because his wife's mom didn't let us do anything to help: It can really damage his relationship with his family. To this day me and my brothers mom is still very hurt she wasn't allowed to help with legit anything. Not even basic decoration setup. I honestly don't care myself, but a mother really does. Same thing happened when his wifes brother got married. His wife's brother didn't include her or his mom in litterally anything and it caused them a LOT of strain with each other. There still is strain 3 years later to him and his mom's relationship.\n\nPlease try to at least consider letting them help with something. Even if it's just helping set up decorations or handing out programs. She just wants to help with her baby boys wedding some! That's all. I don't wanna see another mother/child relationship get strained because they didn't think that it wouldn't hurt them is the only reason I asked and say anything!\n\n<3 Congratulations on your upcoming nuptials! I hope you guys have a marriage full of happiness!\n\nEdit: Before jumping down my throat: I think wedding dress shopping is intimate too! I totally get not inviting to that, as stated in first sentence. I just was trying to help OP understand what they may be feeling as someone who also had the same experience in being shut out.", "[deleted]", "[deleted]", "Understood. I just come down as NTA. When I got married, I tried to consider my loved one\u2019s feelings because I love them & I want them to be happy. As well as my husband\u2019s loved ones - because I love him & that shit transfers. But within reason. At a certain point, you realize that you can\u2019t please everyone, weddings are weirdly emotional, so you make a choice about how you react to things and I chose to be happy. \n\nI didn\u2019t invite my MIL & SIL to my wedding dress shopping. It was my core tribe. My mom, sister & 2 aunts. If MIL would have expressed unhappiness with that decision, I would have honestly said, \u201cI\u2019m so sorry you felt that way, it wasn\u2019t a reflection on you at all, I\u2019m so excited to see your dress though, have you picked it yet??\u201d And I sincerely think I would have just moved on. Hell, I\u2019m not even sure that didn\u2019t happen. \n\nWe just have one dance under these stars. This is just so silly. If OP doesn\u2019t make this a huge deal, or forever try to \u201cmake up\u201d for it, I think it\u2019s just the styrofoam packaging that comes with the good stuff.", "They\u2019re texting and attacking her for not inviting them, that alone would make me want even more distance. They aren\u2019t close. Wedding stuff, especially trying on dresses is intimate. She\u2019s absolutely NTA.", "you\u2019re the only person trying to see it from sil and mil\u2019s side so yeah, they\u2019re gonna follow you around and say this on every comment you make bc they think they\u2019re right. \n\nand I totally agree, this is mil and sil trying to bond and they\u2019re hurt op is pushing them out.", "Not everyone wants an entourage to dress shop. It's a lot of pressure and a lot of people looking at you. The bride does get to decide how to handle wedding related things and people shouldn't be harassing her and calling her names.", "My MIL was a pain in the ass, but she was important to my SO, so we gave her a couple of tasks that we didn\u2019t care too much about but were important enough that she could feel included but not really do any damage. It kept her happy and my SO didn\u2019t have to hear her complaints about being left out. Small price to avoid family drama.", "OP has stated in other comments, her husband-to-be IS close with his mother and sister. I don't think attacking is okay and have never said it was. But simply stating that it's something she could try to keep in mind. I also agree wedding dress shopping is intimate.  \n\n\nAnd if you re-read, I also said she's NTA.  \n\n\nI just also wanted to share from the other side, being someone who was on the other side, so she could have a better idea of what they may be feeling.", "Oh yea definitely, as I replied to OP and to this person on another comment...it's not that OP is an AH at all, infact, I don't think OP is! I just have also seen where not including the grooms side in things can really hurt relationships and cause tensions for years after :o   \n\n\nKinda thankful I won't have a MIL or SIL to stress over, though am sad at the same time I won't...cause man keeping relationships even moderately peaceful can be rough!", "I feel that. But confession, I was also really type A wedding mode & wanted to do everything myself so it was a challenge. MIL offered to do the hotel welcome gift bags & I almost had a panic attack thinking about it. \u201cOh no, I\u2019m so sorry, see, I\u2019ve already ordered the special stamp off Etsy, and this special hot glue gun, and\u2026\u201d", "Then he should include them in his stuff. This is the bride's call and she considers it deeply personal. Sounds like she made the right call since her future in laws are calling her names already and harassing her. They literally ganged up on her.", "I litterally said that I do not agree with the attacking and was simply offering why they are feeling what they feel and what a solution COULD be. I even said a minimal solution such as helping set decoration up. It's just ONE solution of many. I litterally said I was simply just sharing what it's like on the other side. That is IT.  \n\n\nI never disagreed with what you said"]}
