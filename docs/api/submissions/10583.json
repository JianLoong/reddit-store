Invite them to something else-cake tasting, etc.", "Yikes NTA- and you need to nip this one on the bud before their behavior defines a dynamic for the rest of your life with this man. The details of how you handle this are totally up to you. But here\u2019s how I would go about it. \n\n1. Inform your fianc\u00e9e that you will be reasonable with his family but that you need him to respect your boundaries and back you up. \n\n2. Reply firmly back to the in-laws that you will dress shopping the way you want to and that their treatment of you is hurtful and inappropriate. \n\n3. (Optional but recommended if you want to salvage this situation) tell the in-laws that you do want to get to know them better and you absolutely consider them family. Invite them to a cake tasting, or to pick out the flowers, or ask them for advice on hair and makeup. Really anything else besides the dress. \n\nIf you are firm with your boundaries but extend the olive branch now you are doing everything you can. Try to do it over text and take screenshots. If they come around, great. If they continue to treat you like dogshit- it\u2019s a gotcha moment. Now you have a legitimate reason to decline a relationship with them. And make sure your fianc\u00e9e understands he needs to take your side in this.

While I have not gotten to the wedding planning stage yet (we start with our oldest in 2 months) I would think you want people there who you are comfortable with and not judge you.

I assume these two wanted to bond with you and felt hurt, but jumping to attack is insane. NTA just for that fact.", "NTA - wedding dress shopping is a very intimate thing. \n\nI went with just my mom and couldn\u2019t have imagined inviting my MIL. We did invite my MIL to look at venues with us, so I felt that was a nice way to include her opinion.", "Nta. \nI was a bridesmaid and wasnt even part of wedding dress shopping - because the bride wanted it to be a surprise to everyone. She literally only took her mom because her mom offered to pay for it, otherwise she would have gone alone. \nChoosing a wedding gown is as personal as giving birth, in my opinion. It is about you and you only. And you alone get to say who should be with you for that. Because its an event most women think about since they can grasp the concept - even if they are apposed to marriage. We all think about that \"once in a lifetime outfit\".", "NTA\n\nAlthough it wouldn\u2019t hurt to be inclusive and a tad more gracious to your future MIL and SIL", "NTA.\n\nShopping for the dress is a deeply personal moment, or it is where I am.

You\u2019re in no way obligated to offer, but it would have been nice to invite this woman, who happens to be your future MIL to go along with you to try on dresses- again, she\u2019s going to be a part of your life, so why not make it a pleasant experience and try to bond a little bit? however, his sister calling you a name and throwing a fit about the situation was totally rude and inappropriate. Y\u2019all should maybe try to begin again, acknowledge some mistakes were made, and have a fresh start.", "NTA. It is 100% your choice who you include in your wedding planning. Some of these decisions are intimate, maybe emotional, and YOU get to decide who you want to be around for those moments. The fact that they are berating you is very concerning - have they tried to insert themselves into your relationship often? I'd keep an eye out for that behavior going forward.", "Need more information.  Did your future sister-in-law really call you an AH or did she say that they were hurt that they weren't included?  There is a really big difference!  It sounds like Tyler is close to his family as they seem to have regular family dinners and have included you.  So, unless they are overly pushy, why not include them in a few things.  This could be a real bonding time for you all.\n\nI have two adult sons.  Although neither is close to getting married, I would love to be included in the dress shopping when the time comes.  Most of my friends have been invited to go dress shopping when their sons got engaged.  They all arranged for lunch at a really nice restaurant during the middle of the day and picked up the tab as a thank you.", "NTA\n\nThey can say they care and are there if you need them, but being rude to you about it is immature. \n\nIf I were the mom or sister I would just invite you somewhere lighthearted for an afternoon and get to know you better.

I suppose you could have spent time with them before everything already happened, or invited them as a nice gesture, but that ship has already sailed.

Can they be disappointed and voice they would have liked to attend? Sure. But once they started being hostile and throwing curses around that gets them excluded. NTA.

Maybe if the sister had just said they feel hurt and left out, then OP could have invited them, but going straight to AH (wtf?) made that impossible.

When I got married, I tried to consider my loved one\u2019s feelings because I love them & I want them to be happy. As well as my husband\u2019s loved ones - because I love him & that shit transfers.

At a certain point, you realize that you can\u2019t please everyone, weddings are weirdly emotional, so you make a choice about how you react to things and I chose to be happy. \n\nI didn\u2019t invite my MIL & SIL to my wedding dress shopping. It was my core tribe. My mom, sister & 2 aunts. If MIL would have expressed unhappiness with that decision, I would have honestly said, \u201cI\u2019m so sorry you felt that way, it wasn\u2019t a reflection on you at all, I\u2019m so excited to see your dress though, have you picked it yet??\u201d And I sincerely think I would have just moved on.

But confession, I was also really type A wedding mode & wanted to do everything myself so it was a challenge.

It\u2019s your day, you should be planning with people who know you hear and who you\u2019re the most comfortable with. If his mom and sister are contributing significantly financially, I would understand their interest in having a little more involvement, but even then, that\u2019s a gift from them not an obligation, and it\u2019s a day for you and your fianc\u00e9, not them. You\u2019re not inviting them dress shopping does not make you an asshole in any way, shape, or form.", "NTA. I'm close to my MIL and I didn't invite her to go as my own mom couldn't make it. I went the first time with a friend and the second time with my SIL (brothers wife) and one of his sisters. He explained to her that I was sad my own mom couldn't be there and I didn't want it to be a big thing where everyone was there but my mom so I just had my SIL. His sister was a last minute invite. She has never once brought it up because she knows I was sad my mom couldn't be there with me for it.", "NTA \n\nThere's really no standard here. My MIL wants to be rather involved, but I didn't invite her because I didn't really know her well. She was somewhat upset about not being warned earlier that my parents would be in town for it, but she didn't care about not coming. It's not a given that you'll invite them. \n\nAnd tbh, wedding dress shopping is often a long and boring affair. It's kind of awkward,and vulnerable because so much of it is you in dresses that are ill-fitting and trying to figure out what suits your body, your style, your venue, etc. \n\nLike, if anyone invited me... I'd have to *really love them* and like their friends/family to want to spend a day doing that. Or be certain I could be helpful? Idk, it's not a big deal really", "It would have been a kindness to invite them, since they live close enough, but it\u2019s not obligatory.

NTA.", "NTA\n\nTell your fiance to talk with them... they're being ah to you now and is his responsibility to stop this behavior. Maybe as a compromise tell him to ask them to go with him to buy the suit fir the wedding.", "NTA. Doesn't seem like a misunderstanding either. If you aren't close to them then you don't have to call them for your wedding shopping which is about you. It's your day ! \nAnd i think maybe once or twice you can let them know why as to you're not comfortable. If they are mature enough to understand, well and good. If they continue being rude, just carry on with your day ...", "\nI had barely knew my future MIL when we got engaged. Of course we met, but we didn\u2019t spend very much time together. \n\nMy mother had one rule. \nShe and only the the bride to be would be going dress shopping. She paid for out dress and it was a mother/daughter thing. \nNo friends, no sisters ( I have 3), no anybody else. \nNone of the MIL\u2019s had a problem with this once it was explained. And my MIL only had boys, so she would never get that experience. \n\nNow, I also have 2 brothers and saw how mom was left out of any wedding planning. \nSo I invited my MIL to the food tasting at the catering hall, just me and her, (H was working)and brought and showed her everything we were debating on. I wanted her to feel involved. It was her sons wedding also. \n\nYour SIL and MIL are out of order definitely. No argument there, but MIL may feel hurt and sil is fighting her battle, which she shouldn\u2019t. \n\nSo maybe just try to be a little more open with some of the other wedding planning. You don\u2019t have to take her picks or advice, but at least make her feel like she is in the know, so to speak, and remember, it\u2019s her sons wedding also. She just doesn\u2019t want to show up and have no idea what it\u2019s gonna be like.", "NTA.  But, why not invite them.  Just say you had no idea they\u2019d be interested in joking in.  You don\u2019t have to pick a dress while they are there if you don\u2019t want to. \nThey sound like they\u2019ll cause you trouble in the future and they are your future in-laws.\n\nETA.  The correct response on their part would have been to contact you and say we would really love to come dress shopping with you.  Trust me if he\u2019s close to his family you don\u2019t want to start off on the wrong foot because he will be the monkey in the middle.", "Wait, do you mean that you didn't invite them to the wedding itself or just shopping for the wedding?", "YTA.

There's nothing here to imply that he invited her family to his planning things \u2014 is he also the asshole, or is she the only one expected to invite people who immediately jump to being nasty to her?", "Yep. I invited my mom, several friends and MIL&SIL. EVERYONE hated the dress I wanted and loved a dress I hated. I got the one everyone else loved and cried over and didn\u2019t really like my wedding. \n\nMy best friend took me and another friend of hers and it was a spectacular time. She got what she wanted and had support. This is the way.", "Oh really? I thought it was just the bridal party and the bride's Mom that accompanied the bride when shopping for gowns.", "I dont think it is a tradition. Its more that you\u2019re buying an item for potentially thousands for a day where you are the centre of attention. You want opinions. Clearly some dont. There isnt a rule on who you invite (if you invite anyone) but usually someone you\u2019re comfortable with and whose opinion you value.", "The only person my wife took dress \"shopping\" with her was me. I say \"shopping\" because she found a designer she really liked, and it was more about consulting on changes to one of her example dresses.", "I\u2019m in the US and was invited with multiple friends and sis in laws for dress shopping. Moms and mom in laws were also there.", "I live in the UK. My sister took my mum and all 5 of her bridesmaids dress shopping. \n\nWhen I go dress shopping soon, I'll be taking my mum, my 2 sisters, my stepdaughter, and it's going to sound strange, my stepdaughters mum. (She's a really good friend of mine and although she's technically an ex of my other half, she also isn't because they were never in a relationship, just got drunk, had sex and fell pregnant.)\n\nI always thought it was common to take a few people with you, I certainly wouldn't go on my own. Need opinions."]}
