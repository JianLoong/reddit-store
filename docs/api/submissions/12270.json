Yeah, no. Definitely a scammer. You did the right thing, because who knows how much this person could've milked out of you. I'm sorry for the heartbreak, though.", "DO NOT SEND MONEY!!!!!!!", "Y T A you should definitely give her money, in fact I think she changed her Reddit handle to u/Schoobydoo42 so that's where you should send the money.\n\nAnyway I hope this isn't real but it's Reddit so there's every chance it is real. Obviously NTA and you poor thing, this isn't your gf this is a scammer. I'm sorry.", "NTA.  Maybe being reserved and cautious saved you from being scammed again.
