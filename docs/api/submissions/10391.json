They made it a standard, and you are merely continuing the tradition they created.", "NTA. Honestly, your parents sound appalling. I mean, it's been 10 years, they should've accepted the situation by now, and they still behave like that? I'd say not invite them at all.", "NTA. Love it.

I've read this before.", "NTA\n\nBut you WBTA if you continue to allow your parents to treat your husband this way. Keeping quiet while you are around isn't good enough either imo. My dad badmouthed my husband behind our back before Christmas and Ive talked to him once  since, only to tell him I didn't appreciate it. Your parents are not going to get over this any time soon if they haven't yet. This is no longer about the age difference or when you got together. No boy you brought home was gonna be good enough. Go LC/ NC. Let dad walk away and smile while he does.", "NTA: Your parents don\u2019t sound like the kind of people, who I would want contact with at all. No visit from them or to them.

Wouldn't that be his choice, and none of your responsibility?", "ESH\n\nYour parents have been bullying your husband for a fucking DECADE, and you still choose to visit them? \n\nGrow a backbone and go no contact.\n\nYour father doesn\u2019t respect your husband, and he doesn\u2019t respect you either. The problem isn\u2019t that you are being petty - the problem is you\u2019re still expecting your husband to be around someone who hates him.\n\nYou are not a posession. You chose to get married, you chose to stay married for a decade, you love your husband, and if your parents can\u2019t accept that and behave with basic decency and manners, they can get out of your home and your life.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
