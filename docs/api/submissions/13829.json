For you, since you\u2019re the one asking, everyone is entitled to their own feelings and it\u2019s not fair to say he \u201ccan\u2019t\u201d feel a certain way. I think what you really mean is you don\u2019t want him to vent about his feelings to you when unpleasant pregnancy symptoms cause him minor frustrations. You don\u2019t get to police his feelings, but you can set boundaries about what you\u2019re willing to do in regards to his feelings. You don\u2019t want to listen to complaints about how pregnancy symptoms inconvenience him (totally reasonable & normal, especially when you\u2019re the one feeling crummy), and you can tell him that. \n\nMinor frustration is normal on his part, but venting & griping about being inconvenienced to the partner who is bearing the physical toll of pregnancy for the both of you is poor form on his part. That\u2019s where he\u2019s the asshole in this incident. He can handle his feelings on his own, wait until you\u2019re feeling better to initiate a discussion about division of labor, readjust his expectations of what equitable division of labor looks like with a pregnant spouse, etc. \n\nThe ways he manages his emotions & respects your boundaries are his responsibility & his decision, but setting your boundaries respectfully is yours. This is a really good time to work on respectful & healthy communication skills as a couple. The years when kids are under 4-5 years old are typically the most stressful for couples, and your communication skills will be tested. \n\nGood luck & congratulations on your pregnancy!", "I\u2019ll vote NAH - it sounds like that argument didn\u2019t go the best.  However, you have been able to share tasks in a respectful and fair way in the past which makes me think this is not part of a bigger AH problem with either of you. \n\nMaybe you can think of a new plan so you do the less physically demanding chores until you are recovered from pregnancy and birth.  Like others have said, late pregnancy through the newborn period is a hard time for most couples.  Keep communicating with each other and it will get better again.", "NAH or ESH I think.

If you're having bad cramps and severe nausea, you probably shouldn't be exerting yourself unless you absolutely have to. \n\nHe needs to step up; what is he going to be like when you're nine months pregnant, and can't do a lot of the household chores?

The key here is conversation. Commit to coming together and talking about current distribution of home chores and responsibility and coming up with a new plan. You will need to come up with new plans regularly over the coming weeks and months as you cope with later stages of pregnancy, labor, postpartum, sleeplessness, lactation and more! Whenever my husband and I found the load was getting unbalanced, we realized that something had changed and we needed to re-strategize. This is how we figured out that he was better with baby wake-up\u2019s if they happened after 2 am and I was better before. Speaking of division of labor, you should be reading up on labor and your part of this hard work of developing and birthing a new human and he should be reading up on newborn care and care of a lactating person! I had a c-section after 2 days of labor and my husband was so pleased that he had read the newborn care books. He jumped right in and with help from nurses and postpartum doula felt confident and I was at ease knowing he could do it. Once I was up and around, he taught me how to change and swaddle her. Right now, you can\u2019t carry laundry up two flights. Neither of you are mind-readers, though. Time to talk things through.", "Mild ESH.\n\nEverybody's feelings are valid and they're allowed to feel them. How they act on those feelings is another matter. Your husband blurting out that he was frustrated that you couldn't do something makes him an AH, and he should have expressed how he felt with a little more empathy.\n\nYou're the AH for invalidating his feelings. You could have lead with, \"I'm sorry, I should have said before that I can't handle all of the laundry and two flights of stairs, could you handle it?\"\n\nI do very much get that you're probably neither in the best of headspaces right now. Between the effects of the pregnancy on you, and the second hand effects that it's also having on your husband means you're possibly slightly more short-tempered now than you would be normally, especially as you're both still working full time.\n\nCommunication is the key. Talking is great, but listening is a superpower. Sit down and talk when you both have the time, and remember it's the pair of you against the problem, not against each other. Your husband possibly didn't necessarily have a problem with your pregnancy symptoms preventing you from doing a chore, but was frustrated you hadn't told him before so he had to adjust his morning schedule before work, without notice, to do it himself.", "Same reaction,AH? meh..

We've done that kind of thing in the past (I have bad allergies so he always does the lawn in the summer, and he has a bad back so I always do the snow removal) so it might help with this too.

So you probably will have more trouble carrying things up and down stairs and should have him do that from now on. Or get smaller baskets with handles sort of like the ones for grocery shopping. That way you can keep one hand on the stair rail at all times and carry smaller loads up at a time.  But even that option may not be safe at all stages of your pregnancy. \n\nI agree with people who say you shouldn\u2019t tell him he can\u2019t voice his frustration.

My sister was high risk worked fulltime did the housework and a month before she gave birth they renovated theri bedroom, kitchen , baby's room was a lot of mess she never once bitched about anything or used  her pregnancy as an exuse to not do a simple thing or never once shit on her husbands feelings", "I was stubborn and picked up a box I really, really shouldn\u2019t have while pregnant with my first. I spent the next two days lying on the floor with a blown out back. My husband literally carried me around the house for two days. What would this dude do?", "That's going too far. But I can see where you're coming from. They obviously need a serious talk about how they are both feeling. Otherwise, when the baby is here, they will both just fall apart.", "The worst of my pregnancy symptoms were in the first few weeks. I had relatively little nausea and no sickness but I felt weak, shaky and lightheaded quite often. I believe this is quite common as the body is adjusting to the sudden flood of hormones, once it\u2019s more used to things it settles down a bit.\n\nObviously this is a very individual thing though. I felt a bit grotty for the first few weeks then felt fine to the point that I was out mowing the lawn the day before I went into labour. Other women are completely debilitated by pregnancy from implantation to delivery. No two pregnancies are the same.\n\nI can sort of see why people might dismiss early pregnancy symptoms. It\u2019s the same phenomenon that has people saying that pain \"can\u2019t be that bad\". If you can\u2019t see something it\u2019s much easier to underestimate it or even forget it. But that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not there.", "My soon to be ex husband thought I was over exaggerating my all day morning sickness my whole pregnancy. He even asked my OB if I was faking it. He was mad I couldn't stand the smell of certain foods that would cause me to throw up :/", "My worst pregnancy by far was the one where I carried so small that you couldn\u2019t tell I was pregnant a week before my due date. The easiest pregnancy was my biggest.", "I mean, pregnancy is not an excuse to treat others poorly. Most pregnancies don't require you to not do any chores or work, or demand your partner drive an hour to get you special ice cream at 10 pm. There are lots of posts on here of people using pregnancy as an excuse to be entitled and abusive, but some concessions are necessary.", "Lol. Right before her due date...anything said during labor doesn't count hahaha", "Would probably make the delivery safer", "He's mad at her for not doing a chore that he's supposed to while she is physically unable to. That is not kind. It is probably indicative of bigger problems.", "The fact that he understands work related issues but not pregnancy ones is a bad sign, a really bad one. It suggests that as long as she is making $ she is worthy of help. It also could mean he can't relate to her issues that he hasn't experienced himself.", "I agree with you.\n\nWhat I think I might disagree is that he's allowed to make 1 comment. \n\nWe can't expect him to be perfect. If this happens everyday, then yeah, could be a problem.\n\nBut people saying that this is a bad sign or that he's an asshole are just overreacting.\nYou are allowed to fail and make mistakes. That doesn't make you an asshole.", "Look up household mental load.", "I actually agree with you on this. I think women deaerve full and sole credit for having a child. Men simply play a supporting role. We get you pregnant, but that doesn't exactly require much skill (or effort, tbh). For the jext 9 months, we just tend to the woman who's actually doing the hard work. I would feel ridiculous saying \"we\" were pregnant. Never said anything so stupid when my ex was pregnant. She was pregnant, not we.", "Of course, not all feelings need voiced, but sometimes people don't know what to do to manage those emotions and it's better to be expressed than bottled up and turned into resentment or something else.", "It's literally not your job to be clairvoyant to what laundry your husband might need. And you don't need to ask. Seriously this isn't about you not looking out for his needs. He's presumably a grown man, yes? He can do things for himself. It's not your job to ask. You're not his mother. Men all too often don't already do things without being told. \nAlso some men start competing for attention before the child is born. It's like they subconsciously, or actually just consciously think they're not going to be the center of attention anymore. Note. This is not the part where you go trying to placate him. He needs to step up to see you're the one who needs the help and do it without being told.", "Do you have a list of the emotions you permit your husband to feel?", "Do you think it\u2019s ok to tell anyone that they are not allowed to have an emotion?", "It\u2019s alright. Men know in heterosexual relationships they\u2019re not allowed to express their emotions because of the \u201cemotional labor\u201d it causes their partner. Men are expected to suck it up and suffer in silence. The reverse situation of course does not apply to their partner.", "I moved my kids' art easel while i was 13 weeks pregnant and ended up aggravating a subchorionic hemorrhage. Four weeks of stressing over bleeding and then having to restrict what I could carry to 10lbs. It sucked.", "I can tell you from the perspective of an abused husband (thankfully divorced) this is how it starts. It's a sign of her entitlement. She needs to get this problem under control now. To use a reddit phrase she is going to have to do a lot of emotional labour to get over herself.\n\nAs an adult this shouldn't have even been a fight he should have just picked up the damn laundry baskets. It's not like they weigh eighty pounds. This petty keeping score is not good for the marriage either.", "Very true. Pregnancy hits the ground running, no time is wasted. Before the fetus grows, you have to grow an entire new organ first, and that really takes a toll", "I\u2019m glad he\u2019ll soon be an ex! He sounds deeply selfish. If my partner was dealing with that to bring my child into the world, I\u2019d be bending over backwards to make it easier for them, not be angry at them!", "Jfc he made one comment. People are allowed to be frustrated with their partner and voice that frustration. Communication is key in any relationship, but let's cool it on telling OP to make this into a big thing.", "Then \"people\" need to go to a therapist, or journal, or talk to a friend, or meditate, or pray, or whatever they do, and not express just absolutely everything  they feel to a more vulnerable partner/family member. \n\nSome situations that merit this:  \n\\- Father angry at a child for being terminally ill   \n\\- Husband feeling offended or angry when his heavily pregnant wife cannot have intercourse with him   \n\\- Wife feeling relieved when husband's mother who'd been sick for a long time, dies   \n\\- Brother feeling embarrassed by sister's wheelchair use   \n\\- Mother feeling embarrassed by her daughter coming out as gay  \n\n\nBetter explained in the \"ring theory\" or the \"kvetching order\"  \n\n\n[https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/promoting-hope-preventing-suicide/201705/ring-theory-helps-us-bring-comfort-in](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/promoting-hope-preventing-suicide/201705/ring-theory-helps-us-bring-comfort-in)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[https://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-xpm-2013-apr-07-la-oe-0407-silk-ring-theory-20130407-story.html](https://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-xpm-2013-apr-07-la-oe-0407-silk-ring-theory-20130407-story.html)", "Oh please, it was badly worded. I'm sure she didn't literally mean that he isn't allowed to have certain emotions.", "She is not being entitled. And honestly I think you are probably the reason for your divorce if you think she is abusing her husband. He doesn\u2019t get to be irritated that she cannot handle carrying laundry up a flight of stairs. She needs to focus on carrying herself safely up and down the stairs. Pregnant women are not disabled, but if she didn\u2019t feel up to it no he doesn\u2019t get to complain to her about how he doesn\u2019t want to do it.", "And before you grow that organ, which supplies the fetus with hormones, your brain has to do that and also gets affected by all that shit. So you\u2019re getting slammed with all these hormones, like melatonin, that can legitimately mess you up. You\u2019re basically walking around popping sleeping pills all day in first trimester but you are supposed to act like everything is normal.", "It shows a lack of understanding and empathy pretty common among men who want children and need another human being to carry that child for them.", "I think I get what you are saying.\nI don't think the post mentions loudly complaining nor saying his day was ruined. \n\nNo name-calling, can't say if he was calm as there is no description on that.\n\nAnyway, thanks for sharing.", "That's literally what she said.", "Yes, his feelings don\u2019t matter this time bc someone has got to lug the laundry up the stairs and bitching about it matters to no one, and it helps nothing.  \n\nNot all feelings must be expressed or validated.  It\u2019s a basic concept of being a grown-ass person.  Sorry it shocks you.", "Or he could have just been having a bad day and it came out as frustration at his wife. Something to work on sure, but not something to nuke a relationship over. Show me someone who's never said the wrong thing to someone out of frustration and I'll show you a liar.", "Just general guidelines, not relevant to the OP.", "It's not that he's not allowed to feel frustrated. I'm frustrated too! I meant that saying he's frustrated *with me* for not being able do certain things while pregnant isn't really fair. It's not like I can control it.", "Yes, and my point is that sometimes people say things in the moment out of frustration that they don't really mean.", "Actually in a relationship if you're having an issue with something it does need to be discussed. Just because he's and OP is pregnant does not mean his feelings don't matter. I can only imagine how miserable most of y'alls SO have got to be (especially if they're men)."]}
