For you, since you\u2019re the one asking, everyone is entitled to their own feelings and it\u2019s not fair to say he \u201ccan\u2019t\u201d feel a certain way. I think what you really mean is you don\u2019t want him to vent about his feelings to you when unpleasant pregnancy symptoms cause him minor frustrations. You don\u2019t get to police his feelings, but you can set boundaries about what you\u2019re willing to do in regards to his feelings. You don\u2019t want to listen to complaints about how pregnancy symptoms inconvenience him (totally reasonable & normal, especially when you\u2019re the one feeling crummy), and you can tell him that. \n\nMinor frustration is normal on his part, but venting & griping about being inconvenienced to the partner who is bearing the physical toll of pregnancy for the both of you is poor form on his part. That\u2019s where he\u2019s the asshole in this incident. He can handle his feelings on his own, wait until you\u2019re feeling better to initiate a discussion about division of labor, readjust his expectations of what equitable division of labor looks like with a pregnant spouse, etc. \n\nThe ways he manages his emotions & respects your boundaries are his responsibility & his decision, but setting your boundaries respectfully is yours. This is a really good time to work on respectful & healthy communication skills as a couple. The years when kids are under 4-5 years old are typically the most stressful for couples, and your communication skills will be tested. \n\nGood luck & congratulations on your pregnancy!", "I\u2019ll vote NAH - it sounds like that argument didn\u2019t go the best.  However, you have been able to share tasks in a respectful and fair way in the past which makes me think this is not part of a bigger AH problem with either of you. \n\nMaybe you can think of a new plan so you do the less physically demanding chores until you are recovered from pregnancy and birth.  Like others have said, late pregnancy through the newborn period is a hard time for most couples.  Keep communicating with each other and it will get better again.", "NAH or ESH I think.

If you're having bad cramps and severe nausea, you probably shouldn't be exerting yourself unless you absolutely have to. \n\nHe needs to step up; what is he going to be like when you're nine months pregnant, and can't do a lot of the household chores?

The key here is conversation. Commit to coming together and talking about current distribution of home chores and responsibility and coming up with a new plan. You will need to come up with new plans regularly over the coming weeks and months as you cope with later stages of pregnancy, labor, postpartum, sleeplessness, lactation and more! Whenever my husband and I found the load was getting unbalanced, we realized that something had changed and we needed to re-strategize. This is how we figured out that he was better with baby wake-up\u2019s if they happened after 2 am and I was better before. Speaking of division of labor, you should be reading up on labor and your part of this hard work of developing and birthing a new human and he should be reading up on newborn care and care of a lactating person! I had a c-section after 2 days of labor and my husband was so pleased that he had read the newborn care books. He jumped right in and with help from nurses and postpartum doula felt confident and I was at ease knowing he could do it. Once I was up and around, he taught me how to change and swaddle her. Right now, you can\u2019t carry laundry up two flights. Neither of you are mind-readers, though. Time to talk things through.", "Mild ESH.\n\nEverybody's feelings are valid and they're allowed to feel them. How they act on those feelings is another matter. Your husband blurting out that he was frustrated that you couldn't do something makes him an AH, and he should have expressed how he felt with a little more empathy.\n\nYou're the AH for invalidating his feelings. You could have lead with, \"I'm sorry, I should have said before that I can't handle all of the laundry and two flights of stairs, could you handle it?\"\n\nI do very much get that you're probably neither in the best of headspaces right now. Between the effects of the pregnancy on you, and the second hand effects that it's also having on your husband means you're possibly slightly more short-tempered now than you would be normally, especially as you're both still working full time.\n\nCommunication is the key. Talking is great, but listening is a superpower. Sit down and talk when you both have the time, and remember it's the pair of you against the problem, not against each other. Your husband possibly didn't necessarily have a problem with your pregnancy symptoms preventing you from doing a chore, but was frustrated you hadn't told him before so he had to adjust his morning schedule before work, without notice, to do it himself.", "Same reaction,AH? meh..

We've done that kind of thing in the past (I have bad allergies so he always does the lawn in the summer, and he has a bad back so I always do the snow removal) so it might help with this too.

So you probably will have more trouble carrying things up and down stairs and should have him do that from now on. Or get smaller baskets with handles sort of like the ones for grocery shopping. That way you can keep one hand on the stair rail at all times and carry smaller loads up at a time.  But even that option may not be safe at all stages of your pregnancy. \n\nI agree with people who say you shouldn\u2019t tell him he can\u2019t voice his frustration.

Plus our only car was with my husband.  \n\nGuess what! Broken, severely. I has a cast on until they could operate, 3 pins inserted, and a cast for 4/5 more weeks.

UROGYNO is for extreme cases but I try to be upfront about potentials when it comes to treatment options. FWIW, if you need super specific specialties, like UROGYNO, look at State Medical Schools and many do have financial programs for those who are constrained or low income. Urology can refer to those locations if requested.\n\nFor the record, all health care is strained and everywhere is short staffed. I am so so sorry that your mother had to fight for years considering it takes literally like 5 seconds for a doctor to enter a referral. (Literally. Using EPIC system makes it too easy and we have had to tell PCPs to stop sending inappropriate referrals to us because we are getting overrun with patients they are more than capable of handling).\n\nThat being said, going to a Urologist is the first step. No harm in exploring options and seeing what can work. As it sits, specialties are booked out unless you say \u201cBook me next available. I\u2019ll make it work.\u201d then you\u2019ll probably get in before 6 months out.\n\nIt is frustrating at any age (especially as a woman) being told to accept our fate as is. This is not the case and I will always advise getting a second opinion if the doctor seems too dismissive or invalidating of health concerns.\n\nOften, many of these issues start after giving birth but no one seeks treatment because we aren\u2019t taught to or are dismissed when it is asked about. \u201cWelcome to Motherhood\u201d is something I\u2019ve heard stated by many young mothers with urological issues stated by Medical Professionals. \n\nI hope your mother was able achieve relief from her incontinence.

Explain it to him and give him a chance to correct. I don\u2019t have children but have been pregnant a few times and my husband is actually very switched on and considerate and even he was stunned by how much it affected me early on. He had no idea what to do with himself (or me) after the first miscarriage and that\u2019s ok, as long as they can take what you say on board and try to understand and show willingness to make accommodations then great.

Sure, another solution can be that her spouse speaks to others about this issue; that can be fine in many situations.
