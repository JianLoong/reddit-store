Recently I've started really feeling the effects of pregnancy on my body. Sometimes I get bad cramping and nausea to the point where if I move I'll likely throw up. For some background information we both work full time and typically try to split the household tasks equally, although occasionally when one of us has to work late a couple of hours or something the other will pick up the slack. We also have planned for getting pregnant for a long time so it's not like this isn't what he wanted. \n\nWe were getting ready to leave today and he asked if I brought the clean laundry up from the dryer in our basement. I said no, I didn't think I could get the laundry up the two flights of stairs so I was planning to just grab what I needed and leave the rest for later. He made a comment that he was really frustrated I couldn't just grab all the laundry so he didn't have to go all the way downstairs as well. I got upset and basically told him he didn't have the right to be frustrated with me for having pregnancy symptoms and not being at 100% anymore. Also, we share tasks so it's not my job to get the laundry in the first place and there's no reason he couldn't have just done it himself anyways. \n\nAm I the AH for telling him he can't get frustrated at me for this? I don't want to make him feel like he can't talk to me about how he's feeling and I'm starting to worry I just lashed out because I wasn't feeling well. At the same time, it's frustrating to me that he's fine picking up the slack if I have to work late but hates it if it has to do with pregnancy symptoms.", "created_utc": 1680461221, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/129u5kk/aita_for_telling_my_husband_hes_not_allowed_to_be/", "score": 47, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It might be time to have a conversation about dividing the workload differently since you're pregnant. Or maybe you guys could divvy up chores in a way that lets you work on things that are easier for you to do. Like he can haul the laundry up all the stairs since that's now harder for you to do, and you can cover chores that require limited movement.", "Low-key ESH because neither one of you is being fair or realistic with the other. For you, since you\u2019re the one asking, everyone is entitled to their own feelings and it\u2019s not fair to say he \u201ccan\u2019t\u201d feel a certain way. I think what you really mean is you don\u2019t want him to vent about his feelings to you when unpleasant pregnancy symptoms cause him minor frustrations. You don\u2019t get to police his feelings, but you can set boundaries about what you\u2019re willing to do in regards to his feelings. You don\u2019t want to listen to complaints about how pregnancy symptoms inconvenience him (totally reasonable & normal, especially when you\u2019re the one feeling crummy), and you can tell him that. \n\nMinor frustration is normal on his part, but venting & griping about being inconvenienced to the partner who is bearing the physical toll of pregnancy for the both of you is poor form on his part. That\u2019s where he\u2019s the asshole in this incident. He can handle his feelings on his own, wait until you\u2019re feeling better to initiate a discussion about division of labor, readjust his expectations of what equitable division of labor looks like with a pregnant spouse, etc. \n\nThe ways he manages his emotions & respects your boundaries are his responsibility & his decision, but setting your boundaries respectfully is yours. This is a really good time to work on respectful & healthy communication skills as a couple. The years when kids are under 4-5 years old are typically the most stressful for couples, and your communication skills will be tested. \n\nGood luck & congratulations on your pregnancy!", "I\u2019ll vote NAH - it sounds like that argument didn\u2019t go the best.  However, you have been able to share tasks in a respectful and fair way in the past which makes me think this is not part of a bigger AH problem with either of you. \n\nMaybe you can think of a new plan so you do the less physically demanding chores until you are recovered from pregnancy and birth.  Like others have said, late pregnancy through the newborn period is a hard time for most couples.  Keep communicating with each other and it will get better again.", "NAH or ESH I think. Things are changing and shifting rapidly for both of you right now, and that's going to be hard. You're both going to be frustrated. Maybe both could have dealt with it better, but it seems like it definitely could've been a lot worse too.\n\nYou will both need to work on it though. A whole lot of parenting is frustrating, and how you two navigate being frustrated with each other will affect your kids.", "NTA. He\u2019s mad because he had to go all the way downstairs? Not sure if he realizes exactly how much work and compromise it takes to have a child.", "ESH. He needs to be more understanding that you can\u2019t do things at 100% right now, but you also should let him know what you can\u2019t get to - \u201chey babe, the clothes are in the dryer and I\u2019m not sure I can bring them all up right now.\u201d Communicate to avoid petty arguments later. Besides, it\u2019s just damn clothes and they\u2019ll be there when you get back.", "ESH I don\u2019t think it was a good idea for you to take the laundry up the stairs but by telling him he isn\u2019t allowed to be frustrated you told him his feelings don\u2019t matter.", ">Am I the AH for telling him he can't get frustrated at me for this?\n\nESH\n\nIt's a stressful time.  His emotions are valid.  He should work on how he responds to them.", "ESH, but very gently. You're both frustrated and you're both entitled to be frustrated. You're in a frustrating situation. You might consider some couples therapy during the pregnancy to give you both some help communicating and dealing with your frustrations.\n\nAs an aside, the specific instance of him complaining about the laundry is definitely a jerk move, you're definitely N T A for being annoyed at him for that.", "bro he should\u2019ve *known* that you weren\u2019t capable of doing everything you used to. is he really oblivious or does he just not care. NTA. this is not a good sign at all.", "NTA but a conversation about workload should definitely happen soon", "NTA, and also it is very common to have arguments when pregnant and in the early years of parenthood as it\u2019s super stressful. People may say \u201cthis isn\u2019t a good sign of things to come\u201d but I don\u2019t necessarily believe that, it\u2019s normal to feel stressed. \n\nAnd btw I bet you\u2019re looking forward to starting maternity leave! I wish you the best", "NTA.\n\nIt\u2019s your first pregnancy. If anything, he should be making life as easy as possible for you if you are getting bad symptoms.\n\nNip this in the bud before baby is here. He needs to pull his socks up.", "NTA\n\n\nHis frustration in itself is valid as he has to arrage with the new situation too. BUT that doesn't mean his expression of his frustation about this minor thing is fair.", "Small YTA:  Your husband understandably has to pick up more work due to you being pregnant.  It's also understandable that he be a little frustrated that all this extra work is being left to him. \n\nThe issue here is that instead of acknowledging his feelings and talking to him.....like a person. You basically said \"shut up, I'm the pregnant one\". \n\nYou're right next time your husband is upset or feels overworked he won't talk to you about. He'll just suffer in silence.  I guess that be better for you, but what about him?", "YTA. His feelings of being frustrated are just as valid as you having emotional swings while pregnant. He has EVERY right to be that way. You just told him his feelings don't matter and only yours do.", "NTA he has a right to his feeling, but you're the wrong person to complain to in this situation. \n\nI'm gay & I've been on both sides of the whole pregnancy thing and let me assure you, as exhausting and overwhelming as it is when your spouse gives birth, building a whole human from scratch is a thousand times more draining.", "NTA.\n\nI get that the symptoms and restrictions of pregnancy can sometimes be frustrating, but he shouldn't be frustrated with *you*. If you're having bad cramps and severe nausea, you probably shouldn't be exerting yourself unless you absolutely have to. \n\nHe needs to step up; what is he going to be like when you're nine months pregnant, and can't do a lot of the household chores? Or when you have a newborn, and you're so exhausted that you can't keep your eyes open?", "YTA for trying to police someone else\u2019s feelings.  He is allowed to feel however he feels.\n\nWhether or not he should suck it up and do what needs done despite those feelings is a different matter, but that is not the question you asked here.", "NTA. You make a good point about how lashing out at him you do not wanting him to feel like he can\u2019t talk about how he\u2019s feeling\u2026 I would say that to him, it\u2019s a sane and generous sentiment\u2026 BUT he needs to REALLY recalibrate his expectations and responsibilities moving forward cause this is just the beginning of a very long haul.", "I\u2019d be more worried about what your future together holds than worrying if YTA here, because it sounds like it has an expiration date if this is already happening", "NTA. He have legs! He can walk down the stairs and get the clothes himself.", "YTA \n\nPregnancy doesn\u2019t mean only your feelings are valid \n\nYou should have a big talk about maybe switching chores while it\u2019s harder for you to do things later in pregnancy \n\nBut in no way can you tell someone they can\u2019t have feelings because you\u2019re pregnant", "NTA. He can feel what he wants to feel, but it's not like he is carrying 50% of the baby, so he can pick up some slack.", "Complaining about carrying up the laundry. \ud83d\ude44 I'm sure he's going to be jumping up to help with the baby alllll the time.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Things are going to get way harder.\n\nSource: am father of four. Did my part.", "ESH\nYou are invalidating how he feels. And he is acting like pregnancy is easy.", "ESH. \n\nYour pregnant not invalid. You can carry a laundry up the stairs. I feel like you're weaponizing your pregnancy a little here.\n\nHim for getting frustrated.", "As you move into parenthood, you are going to find that things which worked \u201cequally\u201d are not going to be so equal anymore. The key here is conversation. Commit to coming together and talking about current distribution of home chores and responsibility and coming up with a new plan. You will need to come up with new plans regularly over the coming weeks and months as you cope with later stages of pregnancy, labor, postpartum, sleeplessness, lactation and more! Whenever my husband and I found the load was getting unbalanced, we realized that something had changed and we needed to re-strategize. This is how we figured out that he was better with baby wake-up\u2019s if they happened after 2 am and I was better before. Speaking of division of labor, you should be reading up on labor and your part of this hard work of developing and birthing a new human and he should be reading up on newborn care and care of a lactating person! I had a c-section after 2 days of labor and my husband was so pleased that he had read the newborn care books. He jumped right in and with help from nurses and postpartum doula felt confident and I was at ease knowing he could do it. Once I was up and around, he taught me how to change and swaddle her. Right now, you can\u2019t carry laundry up two flights. Neither of you are mind-readers, though. Time to talk things through.", "Mild ESH.\n\nEverybody's feelings are valid and they're allowed to feel them. How they act on those feelings is another matter. Your husband blurting out that he was frustrated that you couldn't do something makes him an AH, and he should have expressed how he felt with a little more empathy.\n\nYou're the AH for invalidating his feelings. You could have lead with, \"I'm sorry, I should have said before that I can't handle all of the laundry and two flights of stairs, could you handle it?\"\n\nI do very much get that you're probably neither in the best of headspaces right now. Between the effects of the pregnancy on you, and the second hand effects that it's also having on your husband means you're possibly slightly more short-tempered now than you would be normally, especially as you're both still working full time.\n\nCommunication is the key. Talking is great, but listening is a superpower. Sit down and talk when you both have the time, and remember it's the pair of you against the problem, not against each other. Your husband possibly didn't necessarily have a problem with your pregnancy symptoms preventing you from doing a chore, but was frustrated you hadn't told him before so he had to adjust his morning schedule before work, without notice, to do it himself.", "Same reaction,AH? meh.. But the next months might be hard times", "That's actually a great idea to split things up differently. We've done that kind of thing in the past (I have bad allergies so he always does the lawn in the summer, and he has a bad back so I always do the snow removal) so it might help with this too. Maybe I'll tell him if he brings it upstairs I'm more than happy to fold it and put it away.", "I think it was more about the principle that he thought I was doing it but then I didn't.", "This", "I mean, that's almost word for word what I originally told him (but I added that I was going to just grab what I needed and get the rest later). Lol\nNot saying you're wrong on the judgement - just clarifying that I DID communicate it.", "Right? Small argument\u2014people get frustrated as things are changing and it\u2019s easy to get snippy. An \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m not feeling well\u201d probably would have went a long way\u2014I\u2019m sure he\u2019s sorry for being short as well. That kind of stuff happens when you\u2019re adjusting to rapid changes\u2014just gotta breathe through it and keep it moving", "So his frustration is valid.....but he shouldn't speak about it with his partner?", "You let him know ahead of time? I thought it was just as you were leaving. In that case he\u2019s TA.", "You really think the moment she can hardly be up because she is so nauses and feels unable to carry a laundry basket the right time to complain to her about that? o.o\n\n\nI mean.. this feels a lot like someone complaining their back is sore from the hospital chair while their partner gives brith.", "You see you say it's him complaining, I'm saying it's him talking about his feelings.  It shouldn't be an argument just a discussion on why he feels the way he does.  \n\nAlso that's a terrible comparison.  I say it's more like a wife taking care of a husband with a knee injury and saying she's frustrated when he can't help with the laundry.", "I find you example just as inapropiate if the husband is in aktive pain. \"It is soo annoying TO ME that you are in pain. \" like... ??? \n\n\nShe is aktively in discomfort. And talking how her discomfort is \"really annoying\" to him, is a complain. Talking about your feelings and complaining can be the same thing.", "No one said annoying though they said frustrated.  To me I think there's a difference between those two words. \n\nOne is expressing their feelings. The other insulting the other person."]}
