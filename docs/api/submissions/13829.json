For you, since you\u2019re the one asking, everyone is entitled to their own feelings and it\u2019s not fair to say he \u201ccan\u2019t\u201d feel a certain way. I think what you really mean is you don\u2019t want him to vent about his feelings to you when unpleasant pregnancy symptoms cause him minor frustrations. You don\u2019t get to police his feelings, but you can set boundaries about what you\u2019re willing to do in regards to his feelings. You don\u2019t want to listen to complaints about how pregnancy symptoms inconvenience him (totally reasonable & normal, especially when you\u2019re the one feeling crummy), and you can tell him that. \n\nMinor frustration is normal on his part, but venting & griping about being inconvenienced to the partner who is bearing the physical toll of pregnancy for the both of you is poor form on his part. That\u2019s where he\u2019s the asshole in this incident. He can handle his feelings on his own, wait until you\u2019re feeling better to initiate a discussion about division of labor, readjust his expectations of what equitable division of labor looks like with a pregnant spouse, etc. \n\nThe ways he manages his emotions & respects your boundaries are his responsibility & his decision, but setting your boundaries respectfully is yours. This is a really good time to work on respectful & healthy communication skills as a couple. The years when kids are under 4-5 years old are typically the most stressful for couples, and your communication skills will be tested. \n\nGood luck & congratulations on your pregnancy!", "I\u2019ll vote NAH - it sounds like that argument didn\u2019t go the best.  However, you have been able to share tasks in a respectful and fair way in the past which makes me think this is not part of a bigger AH problem with either of you. \n\nMaybe you can think of a new plan so you do the less physically demanding chores until you are recovered from pregnancy and birth.  Like others have said, late pregnancy through the newborn period is a hard time for most couples.  Keep communicating with each other and it will get better again.", "NAH or ESH I think.

If you're having bad cramps and severe nausea, you probably shouldn't be exerting yourself unless you absolutely have to. \n\nHe needs to step up; what is he going to be like when you're nine months pregnant, and can't do a lot of the household chores?

The key here is conversation. Commit to coming together and talking about current distribution of home chores and responsibility and coming up with a new plan. You will need to come up with new plans regularly over the coming weeks and months as you cope with later stages of pregnancy, labor, postpartum, sleeplessness, lactation and more! Whenever my husband and I found the load was getting unbalanced, we realized that something had changed and we needed to re-strategize. This is how we figured out that he was better with baby wake-up\u2019s if they happened after 2 am and I was better before. Speaking of division of labor, you should be reading up on labor and your part of this hard work of developing and birthing a new human and he should be reading up on newborn care and care of a lactating person! I had a c-section after 2 days of labor and my husband was so pleased that he had read the newborn care books. He jumped right in and with help from nurses and postpartum doula felt confident and I was at ease knowing he could do it. Once I was up and around, he taught me how to change and swaddle her. Right now, you can\u2019t carry laundry up two flights. Neither of you are mind-readers, though. Time to talk things through.", "Mild ESH.\n\nEverybody's feelings are valid and they're allowed to feel them. How they act on those feelings is another matter. Your husband blurting out that he was frustrated that you couldn't do something makes him an AH, and he should have expressed how he felt with a little more empathy.\n\nYou're the AH for invalidating his feelings. You could have lead with, \"I'm sorry, I should have said before that I can't handle all of the laundry and two flights of stairs, could you handle it?\"\n\nI do very much get that you're probably neither in the best of headspaces right now. Between the effects of the pregnancy on you, and the second hand effects that it's also having on your husband means you're possibly slightly more short-tempered now than you would be normally, especially as you're both still working full time.\n\nCommunication is the key. Talking is great, but listening is a superpower. Sit down and talk when you both have the time, and remember it's the pair of you against the problem, not against each other. Your husband possibly didn't necessarily have a problem with your pregnancy symptoms preventing you from doing a chore, but was frustrated you hadn't told him before so he had to adjust his morning schedule before work, without notice, to do it himself.", "Same reaction,AH? meh..

We've done that kind of thing in the past (I have bad allergies so he always does the lawn in the summer, and he has a bad back so I always do the snow removal) so it might help with this too.

So you probably will have more trouble carrying things up and down stairs and should have him do that from now on. Or get smaller baskets with handles sort of like the ones for grocery shopping.

Probably, but anyone can be unreasonable if they've had a bad day, poor sleep, etc. As long as it's not a consistent pattern of behaviour then it sounds like OP might be one of those people who is married to another human.", "A healthy way to communicate here would be to redivide the chores so she can do easier chores and he has to temporarily suck it up and give her some grace. She's going to be out of commission for a while. He's going to have to learn how to let some things go in a healthy way because pregnancy and a baby means shit is not going to get done the way it used to. His priority should be a healthy mom and baby. \nDoesn't mean it's not frustrating, but he doesn't get to put the blame on her in a joint decision they made. They need to work on a better system for the new situation. \n\nShe's pregnant and she shouldn't be lifting and carrying heavy loads of laundry up flights of stairs anyway unless the doctor has approved.", "Therapist here. You are incorrect. That is not \u201csharing your feelings\u201d and it\u2019s definitely not how healthy couples communicate.", "In normal times if your partner isn't sharing the workload, you bring it up to address and hopefully solve the problem. \"I'm frustrated when you don't do x\" is a great direct healthy statement - provided it's something the partner is capable of doing. \n\nWhen one partner is sick or has physical limitations it doesn't really work though, because they can't actually change the thing that frustrates you. It would be super strange for example to tell a chemo patient that you're frustrated that they just lay around all day.\n\n When it's not something that can be changed, wording it in this way (as opposed to something commiserating like \"man, pregnancy sucks\") comes off a bit blamey.", "Just jumping on this awesome and nuanced comment to recommend that OP and her partner have a good conversation about sharing responsibility around the home and family. This cartoon is an excellent starting point. Https://english.emmaclit.com/2017/05/20/you-shouldve-asked/", "I wonder if part of the problem is the whole \"we're pregnant\" BS.  No, you will both have a baby but very clearly it is only one of you that is pregnant and having to deal with the crazy changes that are happening in your body.  Making a baby takes a truck load of energy and at this point, he should be doing all he can to lighten her load.   I friggin HATE the whole \"we're\" when talking about pregnancy.  It just completely glosses over the experience of the baby maker.", "Or may sound crazy, but instead of him step back and think.  These two people talk, she allow him to express his frustration and maybe they find a compromise. \n\nMy thing is that they need to talk, not her telling him he has no right to complain. Because he's human, he's just expressing how he feels. That's something you should be able to do with your partner", "Complaining to a woman choking down vomit that she didn't carry the laundry basket upstairs is not \"doing the first step,\" it's worrying about yourself and not your partner. He absolutely should just suck it up and deal with it. He was part of the decision to have a child, picking up more chores isn't a surprise to him unless he's an idiot.", "He can have an emotion about increased responsibilities with a child. He shouldn't put those emotions onto the other person picking up her own additional burdens when they made the decision to have children together. Get a buddy or a therapist. Complaining TO her ABOUT her is asking for more than listening. He expects her to fix it for him by getting his laundry even if she feels uncomfortable. She is supposed to save him from these feelings by carrying the entire burden by herself. Fuck that noise.", "Oh no! People aren't humans. Not on this sub.", "Here comes the $100 an hour professional to explain it all\u2026", "Dude.. \n\nHow are you suppose to communicate? Reading minds?\n\nJk, but seriously, would love to know more about your PoV and what's the best way to communicate :)", "i thought that i was the only one who side-eyed this. the amount of times that i\u2019ve heard this and thought:\n\n\u201cno, you\u2019re both EXPECTING. you\u2019re not both pregnant. only one of you is. and they\u2019re the one who\u2019s going to do all of the hard work developing the child and carrying the child in their body. having to cater to a pregnant woman\u2019s needs for the next 9 months is NOT the same as being pregnant. you\u2019re not the one who\u2019s experiencing all types of hormone changes and tolls on your body, sir. stfu.\u201d\n\nit seems like a lot of men really enjoy undermining the struggles and efforts of their partner\u2019s biological changes, as if they\u2019re able to share it.", "Sometimes, you need to process your feelings with someone outside of your partner. This is one of those times.", "I\u2019d say his feelings didn\u2019t really matter this time.  It\u2019s okay to be frustrated, but not everything you feel needs to be validated by other people.", "You see that's the difference you see it as complaining, I see it as someone who just voicing his feelings.   \n\nBut hey let's agree to disagree Happy Sunday", "Again, that wasn\u2019t the question. She asked specifically about weather or not it\u2019s ok to tell anyone that they are not allowed to have an emotion. Point blank. The question wasn\u2019t nuanced. The question was a straight shot. The situation is nuanced but the question is not. \n\nHe\u2019s obviously not absolved of his responsibility in the situation. That\u2019s fucking obvious. And I don\u2019t disagree that he should get a buddy or therapist and that he shouldn\u2019t take things out on his pregnant wife. That\u2019s painfully obvious. \n\nBut OP asked a very specific question and it\u2019s an important one. Disallowing anyone their emotions for any reason is narcissistic and outright abusive. No one is expecting her to \u201csave\u201d him from his emotions but no one should can disallow someone from having an emotion.", "Not that person but communication doesn't really come from reaction; instead of dit down and voice his concerns he choose to snap them back at her over a minor issue - that doesn't help him show his side and that doesn't make OP less pregnant. \n\nWhen and how are as important as what you say.", "Not a therapist, but have benefited from therapy. Bitching at your partner in a moment of frustration isn't healthy communication. \n\nYou first need to sit with your feelings and understand where they're *really* coming from. OP's husband, for example, probably doesn't really give a shit about the laundry. He's probably anxious about becoming a father and all of the additional responsibilities it involves, and the laundry was only a trigger for those feelings. OP probably doesn't give a fuck about the laundry either, but she feels like puking all the time, is carrying around an extra 10-15 pounds of badly distributed weight everywhere she goes, has hormones firing willy nilly, and can't be bothered to take any of his bullshit about the laundry on board.\n\nI could see an outcome here where both of them are calm, sit down and talk through what each of them are *really* struggling with, and work out a reasonable strategy for addressing those issues together and supporting one another along the way.\n\nComplaining never works.", "First it\u2019s important to say that venting his frustration at her pregnancy when she is feeling terrible isn\u2019t communicating at all, and has zero benefits. If he wants to vent he should do that to a friend. Imagine you just broke your ankle and your partner, instead of being sympathetic and helping you, loudly complains about how you just ruined their day because they have to all you to the ER. \n\nHealthy communication in a marriage *is* important, however. Waiting until the heat of the moment has passed and using \u201cI\u201dstatements \u201cI feel irritated when you leave your fake nails all over the sink\u201d and then making a request (not a demand) \u201cwould you please put them away so they don\u2019t fall into the drain?\u201d is a good formula. Active listening to your partner is also important. Remaining calm, avoiding name-calling or put downs, and finding common ground are essential.", "They still matter, they\u2019re just not the focus right now. Figuring out how to deal with the negative emotions is important to avoid conflict like this in the future. He may just need another person to listen.", "His feelings don't matter?! LMAO gotta love Reddit.", "HE WANTED HER TO GO DOWNSTAIRS AND GET THE BASKET EVEN AFTER SHE SAID SHE CAN'T RIGHT NOW. That's not just voicing his feelings, he also expected her to fix the situation causing his frustration, by taking the burden on herself.", "That\u2019s your comparison as a therapist? A minor task while pregnant vs snapping an ankle? I\u2019d want a full refund if she and my pregnant partner were going through some shit", "You don't always need to express your feelings about other people to those people.  There are many situations where this applies.", "Have an amazing Sunday: )"]}
