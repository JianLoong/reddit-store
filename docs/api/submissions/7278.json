For the first 4 years I supported him. He job hopped and never had a steady paycheck. I put him through therapy on my dollar due to severe mental health decline. I threw myself in to poverty trying to make sure he was good. Two years ago is when he finally decided to get and hold a job. Unfortunately, this was around the same time my son started having overwhelming health issues. We had to pull him from school and I ended up having to stay home to homeschool him. He's still home full time, though he's slowly getting better and his immune system is growing. But it's been a very rough 2 years. During the past two years I have had to borrow money from my family so many times. Big quantities to pay rent because my husband didn't make enough on his paychecks to cover rent and what money I brought in (from working part time from home) was barely enough to cover groceries. He refused to ever ask his family for money and stated he felt bad but would take thousands from my family with zero qualms about it despite his family being far better off than my own. That's why I'm so pissed right now. My family bent fucking backwards for us and he sees this as okay but not when it comes to his own family.\n\nNow.. my husband finally got a better job 2 months ago. Things are starting to look up, or they were; until we were served with an eviction notice this morning. I was under the impression we were almost caught up on rent (he told me not to worry about it and that we were catching up) but come to find out we are almost $6k in arrears. 4 months behind. His parents found out, sat us down and gave us an offer that shouldn't have been refused. They are selling their second home and want to give us the property so we don't become homeless. They said we could make payments through them and it would work perfect for me because then I can literally work with his mom at her company and have a steady income again. He said no, immediately. Said he couldn't accept their handouts. They then offered to pay all of our back rent and again, he refused. Said he would \"figure it out\". \n\nWhen we got home I was silent. I didn't even want to speak to him. In my eyes he is deliberately making us homeless because of his pride but if my family was to offer us money right now he would hold his hands out. When he asked what was wrong, I told him that I was beyond disappointed in him. For having to constantly borrow money from my family to him throwing away our one chance right now. He said I need to get over it and that he's baffled I would be so willing to take that much from his parents.

I know Reddit jumps to this if someone so much leaves the cap off the toothpaste, but you might want to have a serious think about whether he is really husband material.  It sounds like he's been highly financially irresponsible for years and while you're with him, your family isn't going to have much of a chance of ever getting out of the hole.\n\nHe's so concerned with his image to his family, but does not give a fuck about keeping you and your children poor, wretched and now homeless.

You are being evicted and he turned down two offers to help your family out of this situation. \n\nHe also lied to you about your finances.\n\nWithout both individual and couples counseling, I don't see this ever changing.
