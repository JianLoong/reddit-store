Taking them to court over this isn\u2019t really going to help much in this situation for you, they\u2019re most likely not going to take your seriously unless you have evidence of them abusing you. And I highly doubt any of that is going on judging by everything you\u2019ve talked about.\n\nEDIT: My vote on this is NTA. As a Christian myself, giving an offering (at least in my church we cal them offerings) is supposed to come from the heart. While it does give you more brownie points in your walk with Christ, you don\u2019t have to give an offering if you don\u2019t wish to. I personally don\u2019t do it often because I always forget about it. That being said though, change your passwords to your accounts, open a new account with a new bank, talk to your parents about all this.

It\u2019d have to probably be a civil suit in court. Also, I know which church you speak of and they are the worst. I grew up in that mess too. They treated my family poorly and as if our medical needs were too much of a burden. They are a cult by all means of the word. My mother is so brainwashed by them from her youth that her seeing this institution they way it\u2019s treated us and her has her mental state in a seriously bad place and we don\u2019t know how to fix it. Unfortunately, you have to cut ties and set some truly strict boundaries with your family and church. You can still have your faith in their beliefs and teachings because ultimately all that stuff is just how to be a decent human being but the people are absolute hypocrites and the worst kind of people imaginable as they don\u2019t practice what they preach.

You might have a basis for a civil action or small claims judgement, but I am doubtful. Also, its not like they are taking the money to buy drugs or a vacation for themselves.

I\u2019m a woman as well, and while yes, our original reason of existing was to create children and serve men, God gave us our own set of strengths too. There are examples of women in the Bible that turned out to not just be mothers (some of them weren\u2019t even able to be mothers). Lydia, Deborah, and Ester are great examples of women who had significant influence on people. Lydia was a businesswoman who sold very good quality products (most of them being purple, which was very expensive back then.), Deborah was a judge who lead an army (this was before Israel had kings and queens), and Ester was a queen that saved the Jews (who were her people) from being massacred.

There\u2019s a lot of variables you haven\u2019t shared that likely matter a lot.   Also, you don\u2019t say where you\u2019re located and that also matters a lot as rules vary from place to place.   It may or may not be theft.   If you do want to pursue that option, you should consult a lawyer about your options.   With the amount of money you say is at stake here, it may or may not fit within small claims (the cutoff varies from place to place and this amount of money is firmly in the grey area; for example, when I was in law school I volunteered at a small claims court with a cutoff of $7,500).\n\nI should note there\u2019s a difference between filing a police report and trying to pursue a criminal matter versus trying to get your money back legally (a civil case).   Victims don\u2019t get to decide how a crime is pursued in the United States.   Police departments get to decide how to allocate their own resources and it\u2019s up to the district attorney\u2019s to decide if a case should be brought against alleged criminals.   The DA and police job isn\u2019t to get your money back, it\u2019s to enforce the law and punish criminals.  In some cases property can be recovered, but I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the norm.\n\nHonestly though, this is probably just not worth pursuing.   The sad truth of the US legal system is that justice is expensive and there are a lot of claims that it doesn\u2019t make financial sense to pursue, even if you\u2019re in the right and could win.\n\nThe human element of this is important too.   If you pursue this it will impact your relationship with your parents, and maybe other family.   If it was me, I\u2019d chalk this up as tuition for the school of life lessons and learn from it.

NTA", "NTA there are two issues her. First, they took your money.  Second the church, this means they claimed your money they used for donation on their taxes.  Yes, report it.  This is your college fund, they are stealing a lot more than just the funds today, they are stealing your education.", "NTA", "7 to 8k missing? Ya, that's theft. And not just pocket change theft either so your uncle can stfu. Definitely report them. Nta", "Nta but how do you not notice this much money missing? I mean, you log in and see money going out. Transfers that you didn't make, and you don't think to investigate? I mean even over the period of 2 years and 10% a paycheck, you would notice at some point....\n\n\"After looking and doing the match and triple checking everything I have around 7-8k missing.\"", "Yeah it makes sense to call the police.. then you can be put into foster care and probably in a group home until you're 18 - and then sent out into the world on your own with no parents to offer support because they will likely still be serving a felony sentence.  No they shouldnt have taken your money - but do you believe their sincerity that they were trying to protect your spiritual well being?", "You might not need the police, take them to small claims court, I'm not a lawyer but I think you have a reasonable case against them.  NTA though", "NTA\n\nI would file a report. The odds of them going to jail are low. Especially if you reach an agreement on how to pay it back.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso, go to the Church and explain they have been receiving stolen goods. Go with receipts so they see how much. Explain that you are filing a police report.", "NTA. I find it funny they said they did this because they were concerned about your eternal life. Isn't God all-knowing? Wouldn't he know that you didn't willingly choose to give your money to the church?", "NTA 7K???? That's not a couple dollars in the collection plate and some spare change to donate to events. That is a massive amount of money. That's not just theft anymore they've essentially committed fraud by pretending to be you. Call the police asap", "NTA \n\nI would go to the police. They stole a huge amount of money from an account they weren't supposed to have access to. Can't guarantee you'll get your money back, but involving the police will definitely embarrass your parents.", "Police probably won\u2019t/can\u2019t do anything as you\u2019re a minor still. \n\nBut the bank may like knowing someone was accessing and transferring funds from your account without your permission. They aren\u2019t a authorized user. Maybe they have something they can do about pulling back the transfers? Under the knowledge of fraud?", "I was going to say \u2018let it go\u2019 but that\u2019s a lot of money.  Your parents have impacted your relationship with them by stealing this money from you.  You now will have to decide if you will further impact your relationship with them over the money they stole.  You only have crummy options here.  I don\u2019t know what to recommend.  Either way, your NTA.", "Personally I'd press charges, that's a lot of money and your parents are delusional for thinking the church needs it more than you do.", "If it is a joint account, OP needs to cash it out until she turns 18 and can open her own account.", "That\u2019s actually not true. \n\nMinor children are allowed to have their own bank account to depending on age. Because I am rapidly approaching middle-age, I had my own bank account at 11. I was the sole owner. Nowadays, I think that starts at 14.", "I genuinely don't mean to sound like a dick here, but why does God need your money? Why do you do it? What's the reason behind it? How does it involve itself in your beliefs? Why do you need to pay to go to church? \n\nHonest questions. I'm not religious I've never heard of tithing before, and frankly the idea of \"giving away\" 10 percent of my pay check to church or that it might be somewhat expected sounds absolutely ludicrous.", "No, seriously shut the fuck up. The parents drove a wedge between them when they fucking stole from OP. OP reacting to their obscene betrayal by allowing their wedge to separate them is not his fault in anyway. \n\nFucking Mormons.", "What a terrible take.", "He'll care if you threaten to contact the police, media and social media.", "The donation they made to the church was in their Name, they claimed it on their taxes.  There is a little thing called the IRS.", "First of all, NTA.  Your parents are not doing what is best for you.   YOU have to be the one to decide if this is something you do or not.  They are completely missing the point on personal accountability & agency.  \n\n2nd...change all of your passwords asap!  \n\n\nAnd picking up from the clues you've put in your post, if you don't trust your Bishop, can you go to your Stake President?", "Thats an insane breach of trust.\n\nYou need to get your account setup where no one can access it but you!\nI\u2019d try getting a list of statements, and any transfers you thought were the tithes, add them up, and tell your parents they owe you that much money.\n\nIf they refuse, its up to you to escalate it, if its not too much money, I\u2019d probably personally let it go, but my relationship with them would forever be tainted. I\u2019d call it a gift, and move on. If it was a significant amount of money, a couple thousand or more.\nContact the church, and tell the bishop or whatever, friend or not, its a serious problem.\nIf nothing is done, then I\u2019d go to the police.", "my friend in high school had her entire savings drained for her parents remodel. like 10 years of babysitting and birthday money, she was saving for a car. No recourse at all cos she was a minor.", "Get them to admit what they did in a text or email. Get it on record.", "Then it's definitely illegal for them to just wire funds out without your permission. I'd still call the police and contact the bank to see if they can rescind the transfer.", "It's not so much paying God or paying to go to church as it is giving to God what's already His. It's a matter of gratitude, giving back a portion of what God has provided. To someone who isn't religious it does sound ludicrous but to a believer it makes perfect sense. I appreciate your being civil about it, most Redditors aren't.", "How so?", "Why she needs to wait until shes 18? She can just never go back\ud83e\udd14", "It sucks but legally that gives them the right to access the account.", "Not enough... if his parents set up recurring transfers, he nees to cancel those. He needs to check his account for that (as his mom said she transferred the money) or money will keep being deducted. 7k missing is a lot of money.", "You believe what you have is provided by god, so you chuck him abit to say thanks. Makes perfect sense.\n\nThere's nothing to be uncivil about. I cant stand people that wont accept what someone believes, or get all pushy and angry because you believe in something different. Have a conversation about it, ask questions, learn some shit. \n\nYou do you good buddy. \ud83d\udc4d \n\n Thanks for your reply.", "Why would OP be wrong to call the police? They stole from him and they won't give it back. \n\nAnd OP wants to go to college. That's why he was working hard and saving money. There's more to life than just working. Also, OP needs to get away from his family and their dumb religion and going away to college could be good for him.", "Hello, ex-mormon here! The church has made it very difficult to \"leave\" on a few levels. \n\nOP is still a minor so I would assume they're living at home. I can't speak to their experience but I know for mine, there wasn't really an option to just... \"not go\" to church. I'd pick my battles and stopped going the moment I moved out. \n\nThen there is the matter of legally leaving the church, yes I said legally. \n\nAs a minor, OP cannot resign from the church without their parents permission. Ex-communication can be a lengthy process that wrecks emotional havoc and tears families apart. The church preaches \"families are forever\" so to \"leave the church\" is turning your back on your family and community. It requires permission/agreement from OPs bishop, parents and the removal of OP from church records. \n\nWithout the removal of church records, OP will continue to be harassed by missionaries and members for life, as the church keeps tabs on \"non active\" members and their addresses. They will give OPs personal contact information to church members in their area, to \"invite them to activities\" and  provide their address to missionaries, in hopes of bringing OP back. I know when I moved across the country, I'd still have missionaries calling me and showing up at my door, 8 years after never having anything to to with the  church. \n\nThe easiest way in my opinion, is through [QuitMormon](https://www.sltrib.com/religion/2019/08/04/lds-church-adds-new-step/). It's a site run by an immigration lawyer, who acts on members behalves, to remove them from church records without them having to interact with the church themselves. It can be a fairly traumatic experience for some people to return to that world, so most ex-mormons have chosen this route after years of being \"non-active\"\n\nHowever as a minor, OP would need their parents signatures to go through with it. \n\nThe church, of course, doesn't love the idea that members can leave so easily. So now these applications have to be notarized first. Beyond that, OP would have to hire a lawyer to have their name removed from church records. \n\nSo all in all... OP could just not attend church, if that's even an option in their parents home. But to actually leave the church is... an ordeal. \n\n[How to leave the LDS church as a minor?](https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/lgolo3/how_to_leave_the_lds_church_as_a_minor/)\n\n[\"Leaving the Mormon church is extremely difficult.\" - Is that true?](https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/aqpgm8/leaving_the_mormon_church_is_extremely_difficult/)\n\n[Why It\u2019s Not Easy Becoming an Ex-Mormon](https://www.thedailybeast.com/why-its-not-easy-becoming-an-ex-mormon)", "It's not to sweeten the deal at all.

Apologies.", "Yeah it's probably still illegal. OP states it wasn't a joint account. They were secretly logging into OP's account and wiring themselves the money. That's theft, it doesn't matter that it's a parent doing it to a child, it's still theft. They also took 7-8k so they're in felony territory.", "I guess i didnt thought about that \ud83d\ude11well i still would stay away from them after this.", "I think the whole parents/minors thing being \"allowable\" does not include identity theft (logging into someone's account pretending to be them).", "Yep identity theft is very common within families and is highly illegal in order to protect minors from financial abuse by their parents."]}
