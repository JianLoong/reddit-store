Taking them to court over this isn\u2019t really going to help much in this situation for you, they\u2019re most likely not going to take your seriously unless you have evidence of them abusing you. And I highly doubt any of that is going on judging by everything you\u2019ve talked about.\n\nEDIT: My vote on this is NTA. As a Christian myself, giving an offering (at least in my church we cal them offerings) is supposed to come from the heart. While it does give you more brownie points in your walk with Christ, you don\u2019t have to give an offering if you don\u2019t wish to. I personally don\u2019t do it often because I always forget about it. That being said though, change your passwords to your accounts, open a new account with a new bank, talk to your parents about all this.

It\u2019d have to probably be a civil suit in court. Also, I know which church you speak of and they are the worst. I grew up in that mess too. They treated my family poorly and as if our medical needs were too much of a burden. They are a cult by all means of the word. My mother is so brainwashed by them from her youth that her seeing this institution they way it\u2019s treated us and her has her mental state in a seriously bad place and we don\u2019t know how to fix it. Unfortunately, you have to cut ties and set some truly strict boundaries with your family and church. You can still have your faith in their beliefs and teachings because ultimately all that stuff is just how to be a decent human being but the people are absolute hypocrites and the worst kind of people imaginable as they don\u2019t practice what they preach.

You might have a basis for a civil action or small claims judgement, but I am doubtful. Also, its not like they are taking the money to buy drugs or a vacation for themselves. They are, correctly or mistakenly, doing it for a perceived benefit for you. \n\nIt was still wrong of them to do it. Charity must come from the heart of the one actually giving the charity.

I\u2019m a woman as well, and while yes, our original reason of existing was to create children and serve men, God gave us our own set of strengths too. There are examples of women in the Bible that turned out to not just be mothers (some of them weren\u2019t even able to be mothers). Lydia, Deborah, and Ester are great examples of women who had significant influence on people. Lydia was a businesswoman who sold very good quality products (most of them being purple, which was very expensive back then.), Deborah was a judge who lead an army (this was before Israel had kings and queens), and Ester was a queen that saved the Jews (who were her people) from being massacred.

We should be free to share our experiences without persecution and live our lives as we see fit. Gay, straight, trans, black, white, brown, pink with purple polka dots; we all bleed the same. It\u2019s much easier to live in kindness and love then it is to live in anger and hate.", "I\u2019m a lawyer, but I\u2019m not your lawyer and not here to give you legal advice.   \n\nI just want to say there\u2019s a lot of people giving you really bad advice here with definitive statements about the legal situation in this matter.   There\u2019s a lot of variables you haven\u2019t shared that likely matter a lot.   Also, you don\u2019t say where you\u2019re located and that also matters a lot as rules vary from place to place.   It may or may not be theft.   If you do want to pursue that option, you should consult a lawyer about your options.   With the amount of money you say is at stake here, it may or may not fit within small claims (the cutoff varies from place to place and this amount of money is firmly in the grey area; for example, when I was in law school I volunteered at a small claims court with a cutoff of $7,500).\n\nI should note there\u2019s a difference between filing a police report and trying to pursue a criminal matter versus trying to get your money back legally (a civil case).   Victims don\u2019t get to decide how a crime is pursued in the United States.   Police departments get to decide how to allocate their own resources and it\u2019s up to the district attorney\u2019s to decide if a case should be brought against alleged criminals.   The DA and police job isn\u2019t to get your money back, it\u2019s to enforce the law and punish criminals.  In some cases property can be recovered, but I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the norm.\n\nHonestly though, this is probably just not worth pursuing.   The sad truth of the US legal system is that justice is expensive and there are a lot of claims that it doesn\u2019t make financial sense to pursue, even if you\u2019re in the right and could win.\n\nThe human element of this is important too.   If you pursue this it will impact your relationship with your parents, and maybe other family.   If it was me, I\u2019d chalk this up as tuition for the school of life lessons and learn from it.

Ex-communication can be a lengthy process that wrecks emotional havoc and tears families apart. The church preaches \"families are forever\" so to \"leave the church\" is turning your back on your family and community. It requires permission/agreement from OPs bishop, parents and the removal of OP from church records. \n\nWithout the removal of church records, OP will continue to be harassed by missionaries and members for life, as the church keeps tabs on \"non active\" members and their addresses. They will give OPs personal contact information to church members in their area, to \"invite them to activities\" and  provide their address to missionaries, in hopes of bringing OP back. I know when I moved across the country, I'd still have missionaries calling me and showing up at my door, 8 years after never having anything to to with the  church. \n\nThe easiest way in my opinion, is through [QuitMormon](https://www.sltrib.com/religion/2019/08/04/lds-church-adds-new-step/). It's a site run by an immigration lawyer, who acts on members behalves, to remove them from church records without them having to interact with the church themselves. It can be a fairly traumatic experience for some people to return to that world, so most ex-mormons have chosen this route after years of being \"non-active\"\n\nHowever as a minor, OP would need their parents signatures to go through with it. \n\nThe church, of course, doesn't love the idea that members can leave so easily. So now these applications have to be notarized first. Beyond that, OP would have to hire a lawyer to have their name removed from church records. \n\nSo all in all... OP could just not attend church, if that's even an option in their parents home.
