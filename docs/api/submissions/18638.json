Taking them to court over this isn\u2019t really going to help much in this situation for you, they\u2019re most likely not going to take your seriously unless you have evidence of them abusing you. And I highly doubt any of that is going on judging by everything you\u2019ve talked about.\n\nEDIT: My vote on this is NTA. As a Christian myself, giving an offering (at least in my church we cal them offerings) is supposed to come from the heart. While it does give you more brownie points in your walk with Christ, you don\u2019t have to give an offering if you don\u2019t wish to. I personally don\u2019t do it often because I always forget about it. That being said though, change your passwords to your accounts, open a new account with a new bank, talk to your parents about all this.

It\u2019d have to probably be a civil suit in court. Also, I know which church you speak of and they are the worst. I grew up in that mess too. They treated my family poorly and as if our medical needs were too much of a burden. They are a cult by all means of the word. My mother is so brainwashed by them from her youth that her seeing this institution they way it\u2019s treated us and her has her mental state in a seriously bad place and we don\u2019t know how to fix it. Unfortunately, you have to cut ties and set some truly strict boundaries with your family and church. You can still have your faith in their beliefs and teachings because ultimately all that stuff is just how to be a decent human being but the people are absolute hypocrites and the worst kind of people imaginable as they don\u2019t practice what they preach.

You might have a basis for a civil action or small claims judgement, but I am doubtful. Also, its not like they are taking the money to buy drugs or a vacation for themselves.

I\u2019m a woman as well, and while yes, our original reason of existing was to create children and serve men, God gave us our own set of strengths too. There are examples of women in the Bible that turned out to not just be mothers (some of them weren\u2019t even able to be mothers). Lydia, Deborah, and Ester are great examples of women who had significant influence on people. Lydia was a businesswoman who sold very good quality products (most of them being purple, which was very expensive back then.), Deborah was a judge who lead an army (this was before Israel had kings and queens), and Ester was a queen that saved the Jews (who were her people) from being massacred.

There\u2019s a lot of variables you haven\u2019t shared that likely matter a lot.   Also, you don\u2019t say where you\u2019re located and that also matters a lot as rules vary from place to place.   It may or may not be theft.   If you do want to pursue that option, you should consult a lawyer about your options.   With the amount of money you say is at stake here, it may or may not fit within small claims (the cutoff varies from place to place and this amount of money is firmly in the grey area; for example, when I was in law school I volunteered at a small claims court with a cutoff of $7,500).\n\nI should note there\u2019s a difference between filing a police report and trying to pursue a criminal matter versus trying to get your money back legally (a civil case).   Victims don\u2019t get to decide how a crime is pursued in the United States.   Police departments get to decide how to allocate their own resources and it\u2019s up to the district attorney\u2019s to decide if a case should be brought against alleged criminals.   The DA and police job isn\u2019t to get your money back, it\u2019s to enforce the law and punish criminals.  In some cases property can be recovered, but I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the norm.\n\nHonestly though, this is probably just not worth pursuing.   The sad truth of the US legal system is that justice is expensive and there are a lot of claims that it doesn\u2019t make financial sense to pursue, even if you\u2019re in the right and could win.\n\nThe human element of this is important too.   If you pursue this it will impact your relationship with your parents, and maybe other family.   If it was me, I\u2019d chalk this up as tuition for the school of life lessons and learn from it.

Ex-communication can be a lengthy process that wrecks emotional havoc and tears families apart. The church preaches \"families are forever\" so to \"leave the church\" is turning your back on your family and community. It requires permission/agreement from OPs bishop, parents and the removal of OP from church records. \n\nWithout the removal of church records, OP will continue to be harassed by missionaries and members for life, as the church keeps tabs on \"non active\" members and their addresses. They will give OPs personal contact information to church members in their area, to \"invite them to activities\" and  provide their address to missionaries, in hopes of bringing OP back. I know when I moved across the country, I'd still have missionaries calling me and showing up at my door, 8 years after never having anything to to with the  church. \n\nThe easiest way in my opinion, is through [QuitMormon](https://www.sltrib.com/religion/2019/08/04/lds-church-adds-new-step/). It's a site run by an immigration lawyer, who acts on members behalves, to remove them from church records without them having to interact with the church themselves. It can be a fairly traumatic experience for some people to return to that world, so most ex-mormons have chosen this route after years of being \"non-active\"\n\nHowever as a minor, OP would need their parents signatures to go through with it. \n\nThe church, of course, doesn't love the idea that members can leave so easily. So now these applications have to be notarized first. Beyond that, OP would have to hire a lawyer to have their name removed from church records. \n\nSo all in all... OP could just not attend church, if that's even an option in their parents home.

Also report the theft to your bank.", "You could inform him of the above and state that you will be going to the police to report this as a criminal act. Also first time I have ever heard of tithing out of a medieval fantasy novels. Had no idea people still did this.", "File a police report anyway. If they try this crap again at least it sets a precedent. NTA", "Lol, he won't. Why would be care...", "> What happened to you was theft by your parents and the church, by not returning your stolen property, is profiting from that crime.\n\nMorally, yes. Legally, no. OP being a minor, the account was likely joint and in one of the parents' name. They could do whatever they please with that money, even if it's effectively theft.", ">This is not my area of expertise\n\nAh yes, the rare sign of an *actual* expert on reddit. The average redditor would never say that.\n\nNot sarcasm btw.", "They weren't on the account so no they had no right to steal the money", "Yeah, it's most certainly felony territory. In fact, I know for a fact that they'd be facing multiple counts of wire fraud. Every single time they logged into her account \"pretending to be OP\", is a criminal act. The cops could quite literally charge them for ever single transaction they made. Just like the cops would charge someone for every single bad check they wrote. \n\nPersonally, if I were OP, I'd be going NC with my parents as soon as I moved out of their house. What they did was disgusting.", "NTA\n\nBut if you want your money instead of calling the police take them to small claims court.", "NTA\n\nIf you have an online presence just make a public post that stolen money is running through their coffers. They won't easily return the money but if you bring to light that this was stolen money, and can somehow prove it, they might return it to you if you have some online support as well. Get signatures if need be.\n\nContrary to the legal route people are suggesting here, which is also possible, but you'll need a very strong lawyer who will hold no bars to go against your parents and the church.", "wow thats alot of money to realize what is missing from them taking from u and giving to church.  hopefully you 18 soon and can move out permanently and go no contact.  i dont know about getting your money back but its always interesting that religious zealots condemn everyone and judge yet they think its allowable behavior to take from their childrens bank accounts.", "NTA NTA NTA \n\nCall the police. NOW. Do not wait, do not let your family bully you into being complacent.", "As a reconstructing Christian, I hate to inform your parents that tithing is an act of the heart. That passage ultimately comes back down to being willing to give in general. Whether that's time, money, etc. You give back what God has given. So your parents are just blatantly committing sins", "Mmm...yes and no.  I've used Chase, Wells Fargo, Bank of America, Credit Karma....none require you to download an app. There are small safeguards in place, such as if you are using an unrecognized device(one you've never used to login before) you'll get sent a code to your email or phone number.\n\nbut if they are using the same computer, which is common in family households, all they need is a password.", "The Bishop may care, using stolen goods Can also get the church in trouble.", "It's worth asking to sit down for a meeting and a conversation to explain the situation. You will see what kind of man he really is too .. Genuinely Christian with a moral compass that surpasses money or not. Your parents weren't right doing this without your consent. You could get the bank involved and police, but if make it very clear to your parents and bishop first that you will not accept what they've done. It gives them a chance to redeem themselves before getting more serious.", "I did look it up before posting my comment to be sure but it\u2019s possible my source was incorrect. OP stated that this isn\u2019t a joint bank account and this is money from a job, but it is still possible that since she is not 18 that it\u2019s not illegal yet. My apologies. In any case, it may still be a good idea for OP to check with police to see if she has any options.", "The problem is that 90% of the tithe goes to the luxuries of the clergy, rather than the needs of the poor. It's just a scam, nothing more.", ">To someone who isn't religious it does sound ludicrous but to a believer it makes perfect sense. \n\nWhen I was still a believer, I still thought it was bullshit."]}
