She then said her and my dad have been paying it for me, that they log into my account and transfer themselves the money so that they can pay it. I had no idea this was happening. I admit this is partly my fault since I should have notice but banking and numbers have never been my strong point so I relied on my parents to help with my banking most of the time. They're my parents, so I trusted them and didnt think this is something I would ever have to worry about.\n\nI shouted at her in front of her friend that she's a thief and had no right.

When that is the case, both account holders have equal legal rights over the money.  As you know, there is no chance to get your money back from the church.  \n\nLesson: As soon as you turn 18, open a sole account at a different bank.  That means you need to get ahold of your identity documents.\n\nAlso, visit r/exmormon if you aren't already there.  There is plenty of advice for you on becoming independent.", "NTA. \n\nConsider writing to the priest/pastor of the church in question and inform them that the tithes made in your name were made without your consent by your parents.", "NTA, but get a handle on your own finances. You'll be an adult soon!", "NTA at all, however, you may not have a legal ground to stand on if (as a minor) your parents name is also on your account. It sucks but legally that gives them the right to access the account. \n\nYou could always threaten and see if that gets them to pay you back, but you might not actually be able to make them do it.", "NTA for being upset and feeling betrayed, but there are a lot of variables that might not make it worth while to contact police.\n\nFirst, if your bank account was officially a joint account with your parents, they likely can legally take money from it.\n\nSecond, depending on laws where you live, your property might technically belong to your parents until you reach the age of majority (e.g., 18 in a lot of places).\n\nThird, if this wasn't a lot of money, it is going to be extremely difficult to get the law to treat it seriously. If it wasn't too much, you might want to let it go.\n\nThat said, please see if there are any steps you can take to prevent this in the future - particularly getting a new bank account that your parents cannot touch (again, this might be difficult due to age and local laws). \n\nGoing forward, please remember that your parents sense of morals tells them it's ok to steal if it's for something they like - treat them as such.", "NTA They stole your money.  Also agree with other poster who said you should contact the church to let them know this \"tithing\" was stolen from you by your parents. Theft is a sin, if I recall...", "NTA, but if their names are in the account you can\u2019t do much about it. However at 17, I was able to get an account without my parents. If you need an adult, maybe see if your uncle will do it for you. I\u2019d work really hard on getting a separate account. I\u2019m proud of what you\u2019ve done with your uncle! Giving a church money does nothing for your eternal life, I don\u2019t understand how they think it does. Especially when it isn\u2019t even their money", "More info: how is the account set up? Joint account? Are your parents names on it too?", "NTA. Tell them that they either pay you back or you call the police. Also remind them that hell awaits the thief.", "wow, last I looked their was a commandment about stealing from other people. They aren't very godly people if they are taking your money like that.\n\nNTA", "NTA your parents stole your money. File a police report and change your bank password and pin immediately. The police will probably tell your parents to give you the money back. If your parents refuse and this goes to court (unlikely) the judge will make them pay it back. \n\nIf your parents wanted your donations to be paid and you refused they just should have used their money. They stole yours instead.", "NTA!! Since you are still under 18 and this money is from a job, that legally counts as stealing.", "Since you are still a minor, your bank accounts technically belong to your parents, so they legally have the right to move your money around. Until you become 18 years old, then you would have to tell your parents to stop, or apply for a new bank to get an account that they can\u2019t take money from. Taking them to court over this isn\u2019t really going to help much in this situation for you, they\u2019re most likely not going to take your seriously unless you have evidence of them abusing you. And I highly doubt any of that is going on judging by everything you\u2019ve talked about.", "I wonder what the church would say if you told them that the money \"you\" paid to them was actually stolen from you by your parents?\n\nNTA but you might not have legal ground if it's a joint account.", "NTA.

Actually doing it may depend on the Amt we\u2019re talking about and whether it\u2019s worth the nuclear option. \n\nThis will burn a bridge with your family (including extended in some cases) and that may be ok given the circumstances.  This is a major violation of trust.", "NTA. This is theft, and to do it in the name of some fucked up morality is beyond belief.", "No but it might not really get far since they have access to your accounts and if they are co-owners not much will happen. It\u2019d have to probably be a civil suit in court. Also, I know which church you speak of and they are the worst. I grew up in that mess too. They treated my family poorly and as if our medical needs were too much of a burden. They are a cult by all means of the word. My mother is so brainwashed by them from her youth that her seeing this institution they way it\u2019s treated us and her has her mental state in a seriously bad place and we don\u2019t know how to fix it. Unfortunately, you have to cut ties and set some truly strict boundaries with your family and church. You can still have your faith in their beliefs and teachings because ultimately all that stuff is just how to be a decent human being but the people are absolute hypocrites and the worst kind of people imaginable as they don\u2019t practice what they preach. I stopped going in 2008 when the gay marriage laws were up for vote and they were telling people how to vote. I was so done.", "NTA, although if you\u2019re a minor it isn\u2019t clear if the police can do anything.", "If its a joint account, or an account that they have primary control over since you are not yet 18, then this is not stealing or theft, at least not in the eyes of the law. You are welcome to call the police and hear it from them, but if unless the laws in your state are unique to those of any other in this regard, I am 99% sure they will tell you the same thing I have. You might have a basis for a civil action or small claims judgement, but I am doubtful. Also, its not like they are taking the money to buy drugs or a vacation for themselves. They are, correctly or mistakenly, doing it for a perceived benefit for you. \n\nIt was still wrong of them to do it. Charity must come from the heart of the one actually giving the charity. You were unaware of it and would have objected had you known. \n\nIf it was me, I would convert the account into cash and put it in a box and lock it up at your uncles business. Since you cannot trust your parents to carry out your wishes in regards o the money, you must do what you can to safeguard it. \n\nI am still judging you NTA because you were a victim, not of a criminal act but your parents' zealotry.", "NTA, NTA, NTA!!!

I\u2019m a woman as well, and while yes, our original reason of existing was to create children and serve men, God gave us our own set of strengths too. There are examples of women in the Bible that turned out to not just be mothers (some of them weren\u2019t even able to be mothers). Lydia, Deborah, and Ester are great examples of women who had significant influence on people. Lydia was a businesswoman who sold very good quality products (most of them being purple, which was very expensive back then.), Deborah was a judge who lead an army (this was before Israel had kings and queens), and Ester was a queen that saved the Jews (who were her people) from being massacred.

My husband is an atheist and we talk about this stuff all the time. We all have the same stories from the Bible but that\u2019s the other thing to that people forget. They are stories. They were passed down word of mouth for generations before they got written down, they are law or probably even 100% accurate but what we learn from them, THAT is what is important. We should be free to share our experiences without persecution and live our lives as we see fit. Gay, straight, trans, black, white, brown, pink with purple polka dots; we all bleed the same. It\u2019s much easier to live in kindness and love then it is to live in anger and hate."]}
