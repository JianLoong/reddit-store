Op is doubling down on her stance that unless she\u2019s praying she doesn\u2019t need the breaks which makes her the ah in my opinion. Like why is it any of ops business", "Doesn\u2019t matter, it\u2019s the principle. She gets the same amount of breaks plus prayer breaks so she\u2019s still ahead.", "Right. I changed my judgement and made an edit to my comment above.", "So maybe atheists want breaks to do... whatever the hell they want. It is absolutely special treatment to get something your coworkers do not for a BELIEF which is in your head.", "What? That's a major medical procedure. Why would they be assholes for being out of work following a major medical procedure?", "Right!? I as a smoker find this crazy! If I'm allowed a break so should my Co worker whether they smoke or not.", "It\u2019s not ridiculousness it\u2019s based on logic. If you want a smoke break, start smoking. You want a prayer break? Convert lol", "That seems more productive than praying to imaginary beings.", "So, is my statement coming off \"anti-Breaks For All\"? I thought I was just commenting on the post, but people seem to be responding like I said \"that chick doesn't deserve a break!\".", "Reminds me of how in the 90s Washington State had legal protection for waitstaff who took cigarette breaks but not for anyone else; so we all took up smoking.", "Right, but that's not what the roommate is saying. The roommate isn't saying \" I deserve more breaks, labor laws are a problem and it has nothing to do with your religion.\" The roommate is specifically saying that it is unfair that a Muslim person is given breaks to pray. Which is insane.", "If they are unpaid it\u2019s not unfair. I\u2019m sure other employees could take additional unpaid breaks if they wanted.", "Because prayer breaks aren't \"breaks\". Atheist Roommate isn't gonna use that time to study Hitchens and Sagan and do mathematics. \n\nWhat the Roommate is doing is more like asking for maternity leave because you got a puppy.

I agree 100%.", "My entire adult life, I\u2019ve never gotten extra smoke breaks\u2026", "Okay I can't believe I'm going to do this but I have to go into the whole history now. So remember a time when Muslim people were not protected and when their brakes were not protected. Imagine that. Now imagine that you have a Muslim person applying to your business, and you have an atheist applying to your business. You know that one of these people is going to be asking to take breaks. So, you hire the atheist. Or, a more accurate version would be the Christian person. Because that's how it worked in The United States pretty much forever until these people were protected. This entire system of laws is designed to protect them from employment discrimination. Please just do more research into the reasons that we have protected classes in the first place. This isn't just about people getting to do whatever they want. It's about the fact that they were discriminated against historically, and people wouldn't hire them. They were denied opportunities based on their need to take these breaks.\n\nThis is the case for all of the protected classes. There is a reason they are protected and it's because they were discriminated against. Age, gender, disability, religion, all protected for very specific reasons, and it's because people were hurt. People were hurt by the logic that you were using right now and you may be so privileged that you don't remember a time when these laws were needed. But that's the case. I'm assuming you are significantly younger than I am, so that's why I'm being so patient. But the number of people that are essentially suggesting that we dismantle employment protections in this sub is staggering to me right now.", "It\u2019s just to pray so mine are about 5 mins shorter", "Okay, but you're not outlining any sort of limits to the brakes. The religious breaks are limited by the requirements of the religion. Five times a day, and it's only like 5 minutes. It's like a total of maybe 25 minutes, and they can stay late by 25 minutes which would make it a reasonable accommodation. People just taking random breaks whenever they feel like it without any sort of limits or system for managing them would result in chaos. Can you imagine trying to go to Starbucks and then everyone just walks out cuz they feel like it and nobody knows when they're coming back? Like you need to be more specific in order for your argument to make sense. If you are saying that everybody should get 5 5 minute breaks, fine. But then the work day needs to be extended by 25 minutes and the people who have to use those brakes to pray aren't actually getting breaks at all.", "Everyone should have the same amount of breaks, that's literally common sense. I was not ever talking about that. I was talking about how you misread and the breaks were not paid. And especially with breaks unpaid I don't think everyone wants a shit ton of breaks everyday because one person does(ik Muslims only pray about five times a day). Most smokers take around 7 breaks a day to smoke. It takes around 5 minutes to smoke unless you are sucking it down like it'll disappear. That's 7 five minute break a day average. That's 35 minutes on top of the breaks everyone else gets. Muslims pray about five times a day. Only two of which would be in work hours. That's 30 minutes. If businesses weren't asshats everything would work out. If everyone just got an extra 30 minutes a day it'd even out. But not everyone wants those 30 minutes. And prayer and smoking are different. Prayer is protected under law I'm pretty sure. And they DESERVE to be able to practice their religion. Please do not compare as they had to fight for that right. Conclusion: breaks should be even and prayer is a right that should be given freely. And NEVER compared to a smoke break", "Thumbs up", "OP stated everyone gets breaks.\n\nEdit: she stated it as a response to a comment.", "But comparing prayer to taking a break to do whatever the hell you want is ignorant. Prayer is not doing whatever the hell you want. It's doing the work of your religion. It is still work.", "Because it's special treatment, for a thing that was their choice. Doesn't sound that fair to me.", "I want a break from people's backwards thinking. Think I can sell that to my boss?", "Your statement is coming of anti-equal breaks. Like it doesn\u2019t cause any harm for people who don\u2019t smoke/aren\u2019t religious to be allowed that same time but when they don\u2019t they end up more stressed ect because they aren\u2019t getting to step away from their work for far longer. So like why shouldn\u2019t a non smoker be able to stand outside for the same time a smoker would?", "It doesn\u2019t matter, it\u2019s still preferential treatment.", "It\u2019s \u201cdown time\u201d in that they\u2019re not expected to complete any work for their employer or institution during that time", "Right but does everyone get the same number and length of breaks, and you just happen to use yours for prayer? Or do you get all the normal breaks PLUS and extra prayer break?", "Can you make a complete answer? Are you now telling us that you have MORE breaks than other employees but they are shorter?", "They are getting the same number of breaks as any other employee, they are simply choosing to pray during them.", "Completely disagree. Keep your religion private between you and whatever imaginary being you pray to. Don\u2019t inconvenience others over your adopted activities. Pick a religion that doesn\u2019t inconvenience others, just like smoking,  religion is an active choice. You choose to believe in something that doesn\u2019t exist. Same as you chose to smoke even though you know it will kill you.", "Thanks.\n\nETA: I found it and it just says \"They get breaks.\" I've asked if that means the same number and amount as OP. When I had a corporate job we were allowed 2 breaks a day plus lunch, so this could be equal to what OP gets.", "So if an atheist takes a break to call their kid, that's doing the work of their family/child raising. So you and I agree, everyone should get the same breaks.", "Yeah well I don't know what kind of argument you're trying to bait me into, but those two things are not in the same category and can't be compared as such.", "So getting on your knees and praying to you is the same as popping out a whole human being? What you\u2019re saying is stupid AF. There\u2019s no comparison whatsoever.", "Nope but you can have those smoke and prayer breaks!", "I should have never brought up smoking lol.", "Not really, it\u2019s a religious accommodation. Plus for Muslims most prayers are done in about 3-5 minutes. And they are unpaid breaks. Asking for a religious accommodation is not asking for preferential treatment. Idk I guess personally I would never care if a coworker got an extra couple minutes of unpaid breaks throughout the day so they could go pray to their god. Not everything and everyone\u2019s circumstances are going to be the exact same, but that doesn\u2019t make it unfair or anything.", "Is parents getting parental leave also preferential treatment?", "Seems she has the same number of breaks PLUS the prayer breaks.", "That's not how accommodations for prayer works. They have to pray five times a day. They're only entitled to a morning break, a lunch break, and an evening break on a full shift. So they do require reasonable accommodation in order to be able to pray five times a day. Now it's possible this employer has different policies, but generally that's how it works when muslim people need to take prayer breaks.", "Go wash your mouth, bigot.", "Um, sure they can??? What? They're both choices that lead to time off of work. More time off for the more substantial event. But they're points on the same line, not data from different graphs.", "How is that what I said? Lol. And, yeah, one is obviously a way more significant endeavor, with significant more time off, compared to the other. But both are choices that directly lead to getting time off of work. Seems like an apt comparison to me.", "They're being completely logical. People choose to get pregnant. So by your logic, asking for reasonable accommodation for that choice is silly.", "Then all employees should get the same 5 additional breaks.   Unpaid just like their religious employees do..", "Hmm true. Ok I'm changing my answer to NTA.", "But stopping to pray isn't a break. It's doing the work of the religion. It's not free time that they get to use however they want. It's required by their religion. I know that it may seem like a choice to you, but to people in a religion it's not a choice. It's a critical part of who they are. You're having two different conversations at the same time. If you want to advocate for different labor laws for everybody, fine. But given the laws that we have today, the roommate shouldn't be complaining that Muslim people are being allowed accommodation. That's a dick thing to do.", "Religion isn't work. \n\nIt is a choice. You choose to pretend that this one book is the real true one, you choose to persecute others, and you choose to take advantage of labor laws to skim extra breaks. \n\nEvery moment of following religion is an active choice to keep doing it.", "Yes, it is a break.  \n\nAn employee is not working for the employer.   That's a break.\n\nTreat their religion like a second job.   Just because you stop working at job A and go do job B for 5 minutes 5 times a day doesn't make it any less of a break from job A.\n\nHere's the thing you don't seem to agree on with me.  I believe every one should operate under the exact same labor laws.\n\nIt is the employees choice to work for both Job A, and Job B.\n\nThey are being given breaks to work that second job.   All employees should be given the same break, or the other employees are being treated unfairly.", "Sigh. I can't believe I'm having to just post this link to a bunch of people, but here we are. Please read this.\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yw5rri/aita_for_calling_my_roommate_salty_when_she_said/iwi6y0b?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share&context=3", "But a second job is not a protected class. These protected classes exist in the first place to prevent discrimination based on the class. These religious protections exist to prevent Muslim employees from being discriminated against. Which is what happened before these laws came into play. Same with disability, race, sex, age. These groups are protected because there is a very large and long history of discrimination against these groups by employers. That's not the case with somebody who wants breaks. People who want more breaks are not a protected class because they don't have a long history of discrimination. There's history that goes into these, laws are written in blood. That phrase means that laws exist to protect people because people have been hurt by the lack of law in the past. Safety rules are written in blood too. They only have to make safety rules after somebody already gets hurt. This is the same concept."]}
