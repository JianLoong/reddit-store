No one knows who the fathers are.\n\nMy husbands sister passed away three weeks ago, and the girls are currently staying in a foster home. My MIL was pressuring for us to take them. You see, we really could, we have the financials and the space,  but I just do not desire children. Neither does my husband. I feel as though I do not have the sensitivity to be a mother, and it wouldn\u2019t be great for us nor the children. \n\nI tried explaining this to MIL, but MIL says you do for family, and that she would take them if it wasn\u2019t for FIL failing health. I basically shut it down and she kept on going how they would spend their lives in the system, and how we have good potential to be great parents, I finally cut her off and said we want nothing to do with being parents to our nieces. MIL got upset, hung up the phone, and hasn\u2019t talked to me since. She keeps sending my husband articles though on statistics of children in foster care and telling him we could\u2019ve prevented this.\n\nMy husband and I have talked about it, but we just honestly don\u2019t want too. We don\u2019t have the time, and we\u2019re simply just not parent material. They\u2019d have a better life in foster care.

I definitely think your husband needs to take the lead too in communicating with his mom\u2014his family, his problem.\n\nLeaning towards NAH because it\u2019s just a tragic situation although your MIL sounds quite pushy.

Those girls likely have some trauma and emotional issues that need to be resolved. That's a massive undertaking even for well established adults. You two are just getting started. It's irresponsible to assume that you can magically give these kids the help and support they need just because the other option is foster care.\n\nTry to be a presence in their lives so they still have some sense of family connection, but don't become their guardians unless it is something you actually want and are ready for.", "NTA, as awful as I feel for the girls. You\u2019re 21, and it sounds like your husband isn\u2019t much older. You guys are babies. This is an absolutely no win situation. Everyone loses. Is there no way to dig into the sister\u2019s history to find their fathers at all? Can you maybe help FIL more so MIL can step in? I\u2019m sorry, this is awful.", "NTA. While my heart hurts for those little ones, I think it's good that you recognize you are not mother material.", "NTA - You're way too young for this crap. It's not your responsibility and anyone trying to force this on you is a massive AH. You deserve to live your own life!", "NTA. For all of you screaming you have to take care of family and they won't be better in the system, she is 21. How would they be possibly better off. Let's place them with a mother who doesn't want them. She isn't even a fully developed adult. This is an absolutely huge task and she is stating she doesn't want to do it. How is it better for the kids to go to home that doesn't want them?", "NTA. \n\nMy condolences for your sister, I hope your family can find peace. \n\nIt's not your responsibility if you don't want it and feel up to it, especially at that age. \n\nI don't understand why MIL can't care for the kids even if her husband is battling with cancer?

Sad for their mother. Sad for the family. Lots of opinions, but speaking from experience (we have two children adopted from a years long stint in foster care at age 5 & 11), foster care is the systems best attempt to keep kids safe. It\u2019s literally hell for most of these kids though. It\u2019s trauma on trauma, and, unfortunately, abuse. It\u2019s a last resort. It\u2019s ok not to want to be a parent.

But what fault is that of the children ? They lost their mother and now they have no one, the only family they have is you and your husband. If you let them go in the system, they will face a lifetime of possible abuse and harassment, their life would be hell, you can prevent it, if you can, please do reconsider taking them in and at least give them your love till they are 18 and can take care of themselves. The final choice is yours of course.", "NTA and your husband needs to deal with his mother\u2026 not you.

You are barely more than a kid yourself. That alone makes you firmly NTA.", "NTA it is ok to not want the care and responsibility of children. \nHowever. Op why haven't you responding to any of the numerous ideas for compromise made by posters? \nHopefully you will consider some of the ideas. Like helping minimal financially if MIL one day takes them. Since FIL has strong form of cancer it could only be a while until she feels comfortable taking guardian ship.. that's only one idea. \nAgain no it isn't your responsibility  but..it make you kinf of crappy for not even TRYING to THINK of ways to help.", "YTA. I get that you don\u2019t want children and that your perfect life is going to be derailed but as a human being, how could you do that to family?\n\nLife happens. Nothing goes the way it\u2019s supposed to & your reaction to the messy circumstances of life determine your character. \n\nThe kids are school-aged at this point, you can always articulate that you\u2019re not a parent but still be there for them? They\u2019ll have therapy (well they should) and hopefully their grandparents to help out too. \n\nIdk you technically have no reason to take them in, but it\u2019s your family. That\u2019s your husband\u2019s blood.", "NAH", "Why can\u2019t you not take them in but still be in their lives??? Give them a little love and presents once in a while. \nWhy does everything have to be all or nothing god", "You're NTA.\n\nNo one should become a parent who doesn't want to be a parent. It's a hard enough job when you *do* want it. \n\nNo one should be pressuring you to adopt children when you have chosen not to be a parent. If MIL wants to adopt them, she should. She can't expect someone else to do what she won't. \n\nBut there is absolutely no guarantee that they will have a better life in foster care. That's not a pitch for you to change your mind. The world is full of people sitting around, not adopting children to save them from foster care. There's nothing wrong with making your choice about parenthood that's right for you. I'm just saying, if thinking they will be happier in foster care is part of your deciding factors, you need to accept that they may not be. They may have a terrible experience. They may come to you one day to tell you this and blame you for it. I 100% support the choice you are making just suggesting you do it with eyes wide open about it.", "NTA but the burning question in my mind is why mil won\u2019t take in her grandkids if she\u2019s so concerned? She\u2019s a hypocrite.. she\u2019s pressing you to do something she\u2019s not willing to do.. why would you take kids in that you don\u2019t want in your home?? They can feel the tension and resentment it\u2019s best not to put these children into that position. Mil needs to step up and take them in or stfu about it.", "Definitely NTA for not wanting to be parents, not everyone is meant to have kids. Now with that said let's talk about the reality of being in the foster care system, more than likely they are not going to have a good future. Plus there's a chance that they could get separated.  Is there anyway you all can sit down and come up with a plant that your MIL takes them in with the help of a babysitter, since they are 9 and 6 they will be in school. Maybe offer to pay for a sitter for after school hours? Perhaps for the weekend too. Is there no one else in the family that can take them?.", "NAH, I don\u2019t think you are an asshole for not putting these kids in a home where you\u2019ll resent them, but also be realistic. There is a very small chance foster care/adoption will turn out well for them at their age (especially the 9 year old), or if it does, not without additional trauma. I can not call your MIL an asshole for wanting to avoid that (and seeing your comment about how your FIL has an aggressive form of cancer, I get why she can\u2019t take them in). This is just a sucky situation", "ESH.  I understand why you'd prefer not to take them in, and I'd have given you N T A, except for this:\n\n>They\u2019d have a better life in foster care.\n\nUnless you're going to beat them out sexually molest them their odds are much better in your home.  Yes, there are some wonderful foster parents out there.  But many foster parents just want the check, a slave, or a victim to abuse.  Any kid who goes to more than one or two foster homes has exceedingly high odds of experiencing abuse.  They may also be sent to separate families and never see each other again, although with just 2 of them there's a fighting chance they'll be kept together if they have a good case worker.  But it's certainly not guaranteed.\n\nI don't know whether you're willfully ignorant or simply lying to make yourself look better.\n\nIf you won't take the girls, fine.  But own your decision instead of claiming they'll be better off elsewhere.", "NTA. You would resent them. Kids shouldn\u2019t be resented.", "NTA. \n\nYou're 21 and you've been married *six months*.\n\nYour MiL needs to back off. SHE can take her grandkids.  The last thing you need is to have to half grown undoubtedly traumatized children you don't really know foisted on you.", "Foster parent here. NTA for setting boundaries, but do not justify it by saying they are better off in the system. No, they aren\u2019t. We finally adopted a child who had been run through the foster care ringer. It\u2019s very, very difficult to help children who have been rejected over and over and passed through numerous homes. Imagine their pain at knowing family doesn\u2019t care.", "NTA - not your circus not your monkeys. \n\nIf MIL is so concerned then she needs to choose between \"step up\" and / or \"shut up\" - and I recommend a liberal application of both please.", "NTA. Don\u2019t do it. \n\nI know some will say \u2018but family\u2019 or \u2018but the children\u2019. Well here\u2019s the facts: if you aren\u2019t 100% enthusiastic about becoming a parent, then Do Not become one. \n\nIt\u2019s hard enough with babies, bio or adopted, but older kids you don\u2019t really know from a troubled home? \n\nIf you aren\u2019t Burning with the desire to be their parent and give up at least 90% of you free time to make sure these kids have Everything they need? Then do not do it. \n\nYou will end up resenting the kids, and that will hurt them so much more than most foster places will. \n\nI worked with kids some who were fostered, some adopted, and the one thing that you could always tell was wether they were truly wanted or not. Kids Know. And they are the ones who ends up hurting the most by the adults trying to \u2018do right\u2019 instead of what they actually want and can handle.", "NTA\n\nI hope these people in the comments who are \u201cthink of the children\u201d also have foster kids in their homes. You don\u2019t become responsible for someone\u2019s kids because you are blood related.", "NTA I really dislike kids and there are only a few exceptions such as my little cousins who are the sweetest most well behaved toddlers ever and the fact they really like me and don't bother me much I'm not an adult yet but I know if I was forced to take in kids at 21 I would be miserable and they wouldn't have a loving parent figure at all I would end up really disliking them and they would get very little attention from me but everyone's different if they don't want kids it's best not to pressure them to take in good as it would not be good for anyone some people might end up loving parenting some people will be miserable and yes I know I'm rambling", "NAH. Taking in two children is a HUGE commitment; in time, resources, emotions, etc. I don't personally agree with your decision to not take in your own nieces, but it's not something that should ever be forced on someone", "NAH but stop justifying your decision by saying they will be better off in the system. No tf they will not.", "Really torn here. From pure logical approach - NTA. You do not have obligation to do so and you and your husband are in agreement\n\nFrom personal perspective (influenced by my culture) - YTA.  Foster care is not a good place for kids. The other piece which really bothers me is a phrase \"we don't have time\"  In my culture kids come first.\n\nAll said NTA, but I would not want to know you", "NTA - you made your intentions clear, you dont want to take these kids in.", "NTA.\n\n1. I strongly feel that it is dangerous to grant guardianship to someone who REALLY does not want to be parents. It is not fair to either party and there have been cases where this situation has ended very badly. \n\n2. That being said, I do feel horrible for your nieces. Is there not any other suitable guardian that can take them in?\n\n3. If your MIL assumes primary guardianship, would any other members of the family be willing to pitch in in terms of babysitting, financial support etc.? Just a thought. Because your MIL is right, the Foster system is horrible. I really feel for the girls.", "NTA. Not only do you not have to take on a responsibility like this that you're not fully prepared (mental emotional and physical, and from what you write it sounds like you only have one out of the three) for, but if you're not, it's actually for the best if you don't.\n\nNow, if your real question is how do you do that without nuking the relationship with your in- laws, the answer is that you probably can't. The good part of that is it means you can be as blunt as you need to be to get the point across.", "NTA and people staying you suck are not thinking this through. These are kids raised by a drug addict, They likely have huge mental health issues that come into play with this.  Kids who have lived with abuse or neglect need tons of mental health intervention.  You are 21 years old, married for less then 6 months and you will not have the skills or life experience to help these kids.  No, the foster system is not better, but neither would your home be.  Don't let anyone talk you into this without doing a ton of research, talk to kids social workers, and understand what you are really getting into. not", "NTA you MIL is putting her daughters choices unfairly onto you and your husband\u2019s marriage", "Let's put someone you care about in a similar situation.  The only one I can see you care about is yourself  so let's say your husband dies in a car accident and your are severely injured and it will take years before you can be independent again, if ever.  Your parents live far away and his parents say they really don't want to be caretakers for a selfish daughter in law.  Are they the AHs?\n\nTo say that the nieces will be better off in foster care is so cold, selfish and ignorant that it makes my skin crawl.  I am a retired elementary teacher and while there are wonderful foster parents, they are in the minority from my experiences.  Children in foster care suffer from situations you can't even imagine.\n\nYou and your husband are these girls only family.  You need to grow up and step up.", "You're not the asshole for not wanting to suddenly have a nine-year-old. You are, however, absolutely wrong about them having a better life in  care. YTA.", "ESH. You don\u2019t have to take in children you don\u2019t want to. But come on. Don\u2019t tell laughably obvious lies. You know they won\u2019t have a \u201cbetter life\u201d in foster care. Lying like that just gives MIL ammunition.", "YTA, not for not wanting to raise these poor girls but for your who gives a crap attitude towards them and your laughably bad take on foster care.  Justify it all you want, but you are dooming those poor kids to a pretty crappy life and seem to not lose a minutes sleep about it", "NTA- You shouldn\u2019t be a parent if you don\u2019t want to be a parent. (And I\u2019m not saying that in a mean way, I don\u2019t want to be a parent and I\u2019m not going to, so I completely understand.) Having children just dropped into your childless lives can lead to resentment, even if you don\u2019t mean it to, and the kids can sense that. I can understand that your mother-in-law\u2018s coming from an emotional place, but your feelings on having children are valid.\n\nAlso, these won\u2019t be two well-adjusted children being dropped down in a new home. These kids are going to have problems that need to be addressed in a certain way. Placing foster kids with family members because it will be easier for them to adjust only makes sense if they actually know those family members. But when it comes to the girls and you and your husband, you might as well be strangers. So when it comes down to the choice between strangers who have no experience with children, versus strangers who do have experience with children and probably children who have been through horrible circumstances, you definitely want to go with the experienced parents. These girls will need help that y\u2019all just aren\u2019t emotionally ready to give them. And again, I\u2019m not judging, I wouldn\u2019t be emotionally ready for that either.\n\nI think it would be better for the girls and for y\u2019all if they went to someone else. And that doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t be in their lives, you just shouldn\u2019t have to be their parents.", "I think you have a right to say no and not want children for that NTA. However, I do think your misinformed on the foster system in the U.S at least its not actually that good. I guarantee they would be better with you guys even if you don't really want them at least they could stay together that way. Its up to you guys but they're family and ultimately would be better off with you guys then the system which will separate them move them around constantly and who knows what else. \n\nI also say YTA for how you view the whole situation and how inconsiderate your being of the children who are technically innocents in all of this and have no real say their lives are literally at your families mercy", "Why can't the in-laws take the girls in?", "They must likely will not have a here life in foster care...

If you could afford to support them, why can't your husband work with MIL to get FIL a home help-aid (sometimes the state supplies this at low cost/no cost) and perhaps supply some kind of minimal living allowance for them to give MIL (within your means).

My granddaughter's father died when she was a couple years old, he was only 24, little work history, and they weren't married.  My daughter received about $1200 per month in SS benefits for her.

You have made it clear that kids are not something you or your husband desire and as much as family may pressure you stand firm on that. There's many kids brought into families that aren't wanted and go on to be treated horribly. You guys can't be the absolutely only family out there, I'm sure there's others that MIL can work on.

I have a friend who initially didn't want kids, but let her husband talk her into it, they had 4.

If you and your husband don't want children and don't feel that you would be good parents then you are making the right decision.", "Um the woman who had the kids could have prevented this by being a better mother. Youre doing whats best for your family because thats what real family does. They don't guilt you into doing things you don't want to do.", "NTA \n\nBut I do feel for the kids. They most likely will NOT have a better life in foster care. \n\nThis actually reminds me of me and my sister.. we were left orphaned as babies and my parents adopted us both when they were around 21. It was really hard for them because they didn't have the funds and were thrown into parenthood, BUT if it wasn't for them I would not be where I am today. I thank God everyday for them and the sacrifices they made to help us and keep us together.. I'm not really sure what you should do, but if I were you I would take them in just because I know how different life could've been for me and my sis and I would not want any other kids to go through that.. \n\nWhat does your husband want? \n\nIs there a way that you can take them in but have your in laws help with watching them or something?", "NAH. Foster care is not ideal. The kids being with family that want them would be much better. His mom isn\u2019t wrong about that perspective. She is also probably right that she won\u2019t be able to hand two kids while taking care of a spouse with medical needs.\n\nBut that doesn\u2019t mean that you\u2019d be ideal for the kids. You could end up adoring them. You could also end up resenting them. You certainly wouldn\u2019t be going into this wanting the kids. So that\u2019s problem one. These kids have lost their only parent, so this will be a difficult time for them. Additionally, their only parent was addicted to drugs, if she was actively using drugs up until her death, the girls could also be coping with years of trauma from that lifestyle. You\u2019re young, you don\u2019t have kids, you don\u2019t particularly want kids, you don\u2019t know these kids, and there\u2019s multiple reasons that these kids could have many things they\u2019ll need to work through. If this was a Hallmark movie it would all work out perfectly with you being the adoring mother and the kids well adjusted in time for a miraculously, magical white Christmas. But this is real life. Saying no is valid.", "NTA. But stop justifying your decision with BS to make yourself feel better. A financially stable home with a connection to family (even if you\u2019re distant and resentful) is likely to be significantly better than foster care for a 6 and 9 year old. Hopefully they stay together. Additionally if this causes further rifts within the family, recognize that that\u2019s a natural consequence of your actions.", "NAH but you do suck", "YTA simply because you said they\u2019ll be better off in foster care.

More people need to be able to admit that and we might have fewer abused children in this world.\n\nI agree, foster care is not the ideal system, but is forcing them onto two unwilling parents just because they have the room and the money, a better solution?  OP is deluded for saying they would be better off in the system, but then again if OP and hubby aren't fully willing to take on that responsibility, they very well might be better off in the system.  \n\nBeing a parent is a commitment that is not for the weak-willed.  It is a hard job.  It is time consuming.  It is mentally, spiritually, physically and emotionally draining.   And it's a lifetime job - it doesn't end when the kids are 18 and it isn't a 8 to 5 job that's only 5 days a week.  You got to be \"all in\" to do this and it is not fair to the kids to do it half-assed.  \n\nIf OP truly doesn't want to be a parent, she shouldn't be forced to.  It sucks for the kids but can you even begin to imagine what it would do to them to find out down the road that OP and her partner were shamed/guilted into taking them in?  Do you think that can be hidden forever?  OP admits they've only met the kids a few times in all the years they have been alive.  Is there really, truly no one else in the family who can and is willing to take them in?\n\nI have raised my kids.  I now have 3 grandkids living with me.  I am a cancer survivor and dealing with other health issues on top of burying my own mother and dealing with her estate issues.  I work full-time.  I am exhausted.  When the grands needed a safe place to stay, there was no question where it would be.  It's been 18-months and the little one asks me everyday if I want them here.  It breaks my heart that she thinks there is even the remotest possibility that I don't want them here.  I cannot imagine how much pain it would be for her if the answer ever was \"yes, I don't want you here!\"  I would rather die than ever have her think that.  And that's the kind of commitment raising someone else's kids requires.  If you cannot truly say with unequivocal certainty that you will raise these kids, love these kids and want these kids, then you better not raise them. \n\nI know it's not what many of you think, but it is the truth.  These kids are probably already messed up from the trauma of their upbringing so far.  It is best not to put them into a situation where they are neither wanted nor loved.

I basically shut it down and she kept on going how they would spend their lives in the system, and how we have good potential to be great parents, I finally cut her off and said we want nothing to do with being parents to our nieces.
