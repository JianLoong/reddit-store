No one knows who the fathers are.\n\nMy husbands sister passed away three weeks ago, and the girls are currently staying in a foster home. My MIL was pressuring for us to take them. You see, we really could, we have the financials and the space,  but I just do not desire children. Neither does my husband. I feel as though I do not have the sensitivity to be a mother, and it wouldn\u2019t be great for us nor the children. \n\nI tried explaining this to MIL, but MIL says you do for family, and that she would take them if it wasn\u2019t for FIL failing health. I basically shut it down and she kept on going how they would spend their lives in the system, and how we have good potential to be great parents, I finally cut her off and said we want nothing to do with being parents to our nieces. MIL got upset, hung up the phone, and hasn\u2019t talked to me since. She keeps sending my husband articles though on statistics of children in foster care and telling him we could\u2019ve prevented this.\n\nMy husband and I have talked about it, but we just honestly don\u2019t want too. We don\u2019t have the time, and we\u2019re simply just not parent material. They\u2019d have a better life in foster care.

I definitely think your husband needs to take the lead too in communicating with his mom\u2014his family, his problem.\n\nLeaning towards NAH because it\u2019s just a tragic situation although your MIL sounds quite pushy.

Those girls likely have some trauma and emotional issues that need to be resolved. That's a massive undertaking even for well established adults. You two are just getting started. It's irresponsible to assume that you can magically give these kids the help and support they need just because the other option is foster care.\n\nTry to be a presence in their lives so they still have some sense of family connection, but don't become their guardians unless it is something you actually want and are ready for.", "NTA, as awful as I feel for the girls. You\u2019re 21, and it sounds like your husband isn\u2019t much older. You guys are babies. This is an absolutely no win situation. Everyone loses.

Sad for their mother. Sad for the family. Lots of opinions, but speaking from experience (we have two children adopted from a years long stint in foster care at age 5 & 11), foster care is the systems best attempt to keep kids safe. It\u2019s literally hell for most of these kids though. It\u2019s trauma on trauma, and, unfortunately, abuse. It\u2019s a last resort. It\u2019s ok not to want to be a parent.

But what fault is that of the children ? They lost their mother and now they have no one, the only family they have is you and your husband. If you let them go in the system, they will face a lifetime of possible abuse and harassment, their life would be hell, you can prevent it, if you can, please do reconsider taking them in and at least give them your love till they are 18 and can take care of themselves.

Op why haven't you responding to any of the numerous ideas for compromise made by posters? \nHopefully you will consider some of the ideas. Like helping minimal financially if MIL one day takes them.

She can't expect someone else to do what she won't. \n\nBut there is absolutely no guarantee that they will have a better life in foster care. That's not a pitch for you to change your mind. The world is full of people sitting around, not adopting children to save them from foster care. There's nothing wrong with making your choice about parenthood that's right for you. I'm just saying, if thinking they will be happier in foster care is part of your deciding factors, you need to accept that they may not be. They may have a terrible experience. They may come to you one day to tell you this and blame you for it. I 100% support the choice you are making just suggesting you do it with eyes wide open about it.", "NTA but the burning question in my mind is why mil won\u2019t take in her grandkids if she\u2019s so concerned?

Mil needs to step up and take them in or stfu about it.", "Definitely NTA for not wanting to be parents, not everyone is meant to have kids. Now with that said let's talk about the reality of being in the foster care system, more than likely they are not going to have a good future. Plus there's a chance that they could get separated.  Is there anyway you all can sit down and come up with a plant that your MIL takes them in with the help of a babysitter, since they are 9 and 6 they will be in school. Maybe offer to pay for a sitter for after school hours? Perhaps for the weekend too. Is there no one else in the family that can take them?.", "NAH, I don\u2019t think you are an asshole for not putting these kids in a home where you\u2019ll resent them, but also be realistic. There is a very small chance foster care/adoption will turn out well for them at their age (especially the 9 year old), or if it does, not without additional trauma. I can not call your MIL an asshole for wanting to avoid that (and seeing your comment about how your FIL has an aggressive form of cancer, I get why she can\u2019t take them in). This is just a sucky situation", "ESH.  I understand why you'd prefer not to take them in, and I'd have given you N T A, except for this:\n\n>They\u2019d have a better life in foster care.\n\nUnless you're going to beat them or sexually molest them their odds are much better in your home.  Yes, there are some wonderful foster parents out there.  But many foster parents just want the check, a slave, or a victim to abuse.  Any kid who goes to more than one or two foster homes has exceedingly high odds of experiencing abuse.  They may also be sent to separate families and never see each other again, although with just 2 of them there's a fighting chance they'll be kept together if they have a good case worker.  But it's certainly not guaranteed.\n\nI don't know whether you're willfully ignorant or simply lying to make yourself look better.\n\nIf you won't take the girls, fine.  But own your decision instead of claiming they'll be better off elsewhere.", "NTA. You would resent them. Kids shouldn\u2019t be resented.", "NTA. \n\nYou're 21 and you've been married *six months*.\n\nYour MiL needs to back off. SHE can take her grandkids.  The last thing you need is to have to half grown undoubtedly traumatized children you don't really know foisted on you.", "Foster parent here. NTA for setting boundaries, but do not justify it by saying they are better off in the system. No, they aren\u2019t. We finally adopted a child who had been run through the foster care ringer.

Imagine their pain at knowing family doesn\u2019t care.", "NTA - not your circus not your monkeys. \n\nIf MIL is so concerned then she needs to choose between \"step up\" and / or \"shut up\" - and I recommend a liberal application of both please.", "NTA. Don\u2019t do it. \n\nI know some will say \u2018but family\u2019 or \u2018but the children\u2019.

Taking in two children is a HUGE commitment; in time, resources, emotions, etc. I don't personally agree with your decision to not take in your own nieces, but it's not something that should ever be forced on someone", "NAH but stop justifying your decision by saying they will be better off in the system. No tf they will not.", "Really torn here. From pure logical approach - NTA. You do not have obligation to do so and you and your husband are in agreement\n\nFrom personal perspective (influenced by my culture) - YTA.  Foster care is not a good place for kids.

Your parents live far away and his parents say they really don't want to be caretakers for a selfish daughter in law.  Are they the AHs?\n\nTo say that the nieces will be better off in foster care is so cold, selfish and ignorant that it makes my skin crawl.  I am a retired elementary teacher and while there are wonderful foster parents, they are in the minority from my experiences.

Lying like that just gives MIL ammunition.", "YTA, not for not wanting to raise these poor girls but for your who gives a crap attitude towards them and your laughably bad take on foster care.  Justify it all you want, but you are dooming those poor kids to a pretty crappy life and seem to not lose a minutes sleep about it", "NTA- You shouldn\u2019t be a parent if you don\u2019t want to be a parent. (And I\u2019m not saying that in a mean way, I don\u2019t want to be a parent and I\u2019m not going to, so I completely understand.) Having children just dropped into your childless lives can lead to resentment, even if you don\u2019t mean it to, and the kids can sense that. I can understand that your mother-in-law\u2018s coming from an emotional place, but your feelings on having children are valid.\n\nAlso, these won\u2019t be two well-adjusted children being dropped down in a new home. These kids are going to have problems that need to be addressed in a certain way. Placing foster kids with family members because it will be easier for them to adjust only makes sense if they actually know those family members. But when it comes to the girls and you and your husband, you might as well be strangers. So when it comes down to the choice between strangers who have no experience with children, versus strangers who do have experience with children and probably children who have been through horrible circumstances, you definitely want to go with the experienced parents. These girls will need help that y\u2019all just aren\u2019t emotionally ready to give them. And again, I\u2019m not judging, I wouldn\u2019t be emotionally ready for that either.\n\nI think it would be better for the girls and for y\u2019all if they went to someone else.

I guarantee they would be better with you guys even if you don't really want them at least they could stay together that way. Its up to you guys but they're family and ultimately would be better off with you guys then the system which will separate them move them around constantly and who knows what else. \n\nI also say YTA for how you view the whole situation and how inconsiderate your being of the children who are technically innocents in all of this and have no real say their lives are literally at your families mercy", "Why can't the in-laws take the girls in?", "They must likely will not have a here life in foster care...

They most likely will NOT have a better life in foster care. \n\nThis actually reminds me of me and my sister.. we were left orphaned as babies and my parents adopted us both when they were around 21.

I thank God everyday for them and the sacrifices they made to help us and keep us together..

Foster care is not ideal. The kids being with family that want them would be much better. His mom isn\u2019t wrong about that perspective. She is also probably right that she won\u2019t be able to hand two kids while taking care of a spouse with medical needs.\n\nBut that doesn\u2019t mean that you\u2019d be ideal for the kids. You could end up adoring them. You could also end up resenting them. You certainly wouldn\u2019t be going into this wanting the kids. So that\u2019s problem one. These kids have lost their only parent, so this will be a difficult time for them. Additionally, their only parent was addicted to drugs, if she was actively using drugs up until her death, the girls could also be coping with years of trauma from that lifestyle. You\u2019re young, you don\u2019t have kids, you don\u2019t particularly want kids, you don\u2019t know these kids, and there\u2019s multiple reasons that these kids could have many things they\u2019ll need to work through. If this was a Hallmark movie it would all work out perfectly with you being the adoring mother and the kids well adjusted in time for a miraculously, magical white Christmas. But this is real life. Saying no is valid.", "NTA. But stop justifying your decision with BS to make yourself feel better. A financially stable home with a connection to family (even if you\u2019re distant and resentful) is likely to be significantly better than foster care for a 6 and 9 year old.

And it's a lifetime job - it doesn't end when the kids are 18 and it isn't a 8 to 5 job that's only 5 days a week.  You got to be \"all in\" to do this and it is not fair to the kids to do it half-assed.  \n\nIf OP truly doesn't want to be a parent, she shouldn't be forced to.  It sucks for the kids but can you even begin to imagine what it would do to them to find out down the road that OP and her partner were shamed/guilted into taking them in?  Do you think that can be hidden forever?  OP admits they've only met the kids a few times in all the years they have been alive.  Is there really, truly no one else in the family who can and is willing to take them in?\n\nI have raised my kids.  I now have 3 grandkids living with me.  I am a cancer survivor and dealing with other health issues on top of burying my own mother and dealing with her estate issues.  I work full-time.  I am exhausted.  When the grands needed a safe place to stay, there was no question where it would be.  It's been 18-months and the little one asks me everyday if I want them here.  It breaks my heart that she thinks there is even the remotest possibility that I don't want them here.  I cannot imagine how much pain it would be for her if the answer ever was \"yes, I don't want you here!\"  I would rather die than ever have her think that.  And that's the kind of commitment raising someone else's kids requires.  If you cannot truly say with unequivocal certainty that you will raise these kids, love these kids and want these kids, then you better not raise them. \n\nI know it's not what many of you think, but it is the truth.  These kids are probably already messed up from the trauma of their upbringing so far.  It is best not to put them into a situation where they are neither wanted nor loved.  And it's absolutely ludicrous to think they would benefit and thrive in that environment.\n\nNTA.", "NTA- Parenting is not for everyone.

I basically shut it down and she kept on going how they would spend their lives in the system, and how we have good potential to be great parents, I finally cut her off and said we want nothing to do with being parents to our nieces. MIL got upset, hung up the phone, and hasn\u2019t talked to me since.

If this were a pregnancy, it wouldn't be okay to strongarm you into parenthood against your will. It's horrific for kids to be raised by people who should never have been parents. It's how most of those kids land in the system in the first place, so it's toxic to perpetuate that by creating more unwilling parents. What happens to kids who get stuck in the foster system is awful. I've seen it up close. Their age and being a sibling group makes it even less likely they'll luck into an adoptive family. The sad reality is they are probably going to be placed separately, bounced around frequently, become pregnant before they get out of high school, and rarely will anyone bother to arrange for them to have contact with each other. It's tragic. But you do not bear any more responsibility for the monumental failures of the system than all the other millions of adults who also don't foster or adopt. Part of being responsible is saying no to more than you can cope with, and a big part of being a parent is willingness to love them and be present for them through bad shit. You are not qualified to be parents in that regard, and those kids need stability and nurturance. Not people who'd wish to god they didn't take in these kids at all. It's abuse. Thank you for not agreeing to become their latest abuser.\n\nHOWEVER. These children are your husband's family. What can you do instead to help them that isn't as their parent? The suggestion for instance to help with FIl so MIL can care for them is good. What else? Could you put away some savings for them to get extra clothes, extra toys? Could you set aside a modest trust fund that could help them one day with the rough transition to adult independence? Could you write them letters periodically so they don't feel so alone? Would you be willing to visit them periodically in their foster homes so that the foster parents and social worker know someone is looking over their shoulder and that those kids better be healthy and happy on your every visit? Would you be willing to be their education designate? (Essentially the official (non parent!) person who talks periodically with their teachers, has power to make requests and decisions about their education, etc). Would you be willing to take point on organizing periodic visits between the girls when they are inevitably separated? (Not to visit you. To visit each other.) When you do your favorite hobby, might you be willing to sometimes invite one of them to learn it and do it with you? You don't have to do all of these. You don't even have to do even one. But just because you don't want to be a parent doesn't necessarily require wholly abandoning these kids into a crushing system. There is so much middle ground. There are many, many  ways to help a foster child other than by being their parents. Think about ways you can be aunt and uncle. Consider talking to the girls' social worker, being very clear about your boundaries, and asking what you could contribute to their lives other than parenthood. Even from arm's length, there are ways to bolster the thin support systems offered to these kids and reduce their sense of very vulnerable isolation.", "NTA. The girls will know they aren't exactly wanted. It won't feel good for them, and probably lead to further trauma. People have this idea that family is always better but it's really not.

Because of what family did to me, I was placed with someone who had a lot of experience with trauma and who had children my age I got along with.

Baby mommas are a mess. 2 are addicts, 1 split a long time ago because she was young and couldn't handle being a mom. \n\nMy aunt wants a family member to take all 3 so that the kids aren't split up. NO ONE can take all 3. The oldest (13) is already into trouble and needs a lot of parenting and attention.

The youngest struggles with school and would need a home where they can get a lot of attention, too. \n\nMy aunt has asked everyone in the family. She doesn't hound them to take them. She asks once and then drops it for the most part. It's at a point where some family members want to lie to her and tell her they will take all 3, but in reality, split them up between families once she and her husband passes. We as family are 100% sure that if they went into foster care they would be separated and figure at least if they are with family, even though they are in separate homes, they will still get to see each other often. I suppose if she doesn't agree to all the arrangements that the family has come up with for the kids, it may come down to someone telling her they will take all 3, but actually place them in the families that agreed to take each (1) child. Yes, I know this sounds bad, but it's the only way to keep the kids in the family due to finances, time, and space in the homes.\n\nI totally understand OP not wanting to take the children. Child free people who do not like or want children ever should not take responsibility for someone else's kids as it is a lifetime commitment. And I 100% agree with you that her trying to say they will be better off in the system is wrong. It comes off as flippant and callous.

Good foster parents across the US are BEGGING for more training, education, and support. The great ones seek their own resources to make sure the kids receive the help they need, but they are dealing with not only the trauma of their origin, but also trauma from previous placements. Unfortunately, a lot of foster homes provide the absolute bare minimum for children, especially those who have reached school age. There are not enough homes for kids in the system. Many families are only interested in temporary placements. Then there are group homes. While some are excellent and provide the best environment a kid in the system could hope for, that is still not a natural environment for a child. When it comes to abuse, the numbers put out by DHS sound pretty good. Only 8 children reporting abuse out of 1000 doesn\u2019t sound so bad, does it? (This includes neglect, physical, sexual, and emotional abuse.) Independent studies and research paints a different picture. A study out of Washington State and Oregon found that 20-30% of children in the foster care system experienced sexual abuse by someone in the home, traditional or group. (Many times it is by another child in the home, which is often not included in official stats.) Then there is aging out of the system. Around 25% report experiencing homelessness before age 21. 20% are incarcerated before 21. 25% have a child before age 21. 30% do not have a high school diploma or the equivalent by age 21. 45% report being unemployed at age 21. \n\nSo, sure.

In some other countries, unless a household specifically signed up to be a SHORT-TERM foster home, they can expect to keep foster children that are placed with them until they are either reunited with their birth family, or grow up/age out, and it is considered normal for young adults to live with their \"former\" Foster parents until they get married or can afford their own housing.", "OP did say she doesn\u2019t have the make-up of a mother and this \u201cthey\u2019ll be fine\u201d attitude shows that. OP has self awareness, even if this opinion is rooted in her burying her head in the sand. \n\nNTA for having the self awareness to know she doesn\u2019t care enough to raise them *before* taking them in and either giving them a life less than they deserve and resenting them, or taking them in and then rejecting them later down the line. Kids know when they\u2019re not wanted in their household and that causes trauma too.", "OP is 21 years old, she is very young to care for children full time.

Maybe tomorrow the husband will not want to take them and then change his mind.\nOr maybe it\u2019ll be a young cousin. Or both", "Yes it does. I\u2019ve personally witnessed these scenarios. I\u2019m wondering if the family has ever involved CPS before and/or MIL has ever had custody, I mean this was an ongoing situation. Who knows what trauma/issues OP & her husband have gone through in their own childhoods that they\u2019re still dealing with, jeez they\u2019re just young adults themselves & I respect they\u2019re mature mindset that recognizes they just won\u2019t make good parents.", "I had my first at 20 and my second/last at a week shy of my 23rd birthday.  I would say they would be okay to raise these children IF THEY WANTED TO.  They don't.  Which brings all sorts of problematic issues and risk factors into play.  This is a recipe for disaster.", "I've seen children in foster care who are caged and live on short leashes, never go on walks never go to parks never sleep inside. \n\nEven if OP and her husband don't take custody of the girls, I think someone in the family needs to do the right thing and at least make sure they stay in contact with the girls, visit regularly, provide emotional support. Sounds like MIL should do that. Because when--not if, because unless they get adopted almost immediately, it's overwhelmingly likely--the girls start getting abused, they need to have someone they trust around to tell about it, and it certainly won't be anyone associated with the system.", "It's not natural for 21 yo to be raising a 9 & 6 year olds.

She said something along the lines of: we all wish to be in our twenties again, why? Cause no one expected anything from us then, you know why? Cause you sucked. She went into greater detail as to why you sucked but I can't remember that part.\n\nMost people in their early twenties, that I know, are worried about getting a driver's license, uni, work, friends, and their partner.

I hope something bad happens to you and it causes you to suffer in some way because you deserve it for being so terrible.", "ESH\nI just feel bad for the kids. MIL sucks for putting so much pressure on you yet being unwilling to take them in herself. You suck for saying the system would be better and for basically saying yes we are you aunt and uncle and your mom did just die, but we don\u2019t want you because it would be inconvenient for us. Your reasoning wasn\u2019t because : we can\u2019t afford it! We are too young! I\u2019m not ready yet! It was: I didn\u2019t want kids so I\u2019m just gonna let my nieces be orphaned and go into a crumbling system where they are likely to be mistreated and/or abused because kids aren\u2019t ideal for me. Same sentiment towards MIL as well. Y\u2019all are letting these kids down in so many way.", "NAH \n\nKinda an AH move to say they're be better in foster care but we aren't there so maybe it's true.\n\nA bachelor's degree takes 4-6 years so it's unlikely someone ~3 years out of high school has a degree. OP says they have the financials but it's unlikely they know how much raising multiple children actually costs.\n\nThey definitely aren't emotionally ready, and it sounds like they'll never be. Children know when they aren't wanted and knowing you're only being raised by your aunt who hates and resents you would be traumatizing.\n\nOn the other hand, foster care sucks and they'll likely be separated. The rest of the family is right to work to try and find alternate placement. It's a terrible situation for everyone.", "NTA to set boundaries and not become parents.

If my wife was against me taking in my nephews if my brother died she would just have to deal with it or leave.", "I would say being parented by family that DOES NOT WANT YOU AND NEVER DID, is probably not a good option either.  Not saying that being in the system is better, but not sure living with an aunt and uncle who doesn't want you sounds like ... hmm a book about a wizard with a scar.", "OP is barely \"family\" to these kids. They're her husband's nieces she's only met a couple of times. The kids probably don't even know who OP is. It's not like they're lying awake at night crying because Auntie OP doesn't want them. So what is the practical difference between the kids coming to live with OP or going to live with a foster parent? Either way they're being pushed onto strangers, but at least in a foster home the parents aren't taking in kids against their will.", "Can I ask, are there adoption options for them?  IF MIL were to go along with giving up custody claims?", "I've had much worse luck. That doesn't mean a young adult whose brain hasn't even finished developing should have taken me in.", "I'm wondering if grandma may need some financial help  like if op wanted to help but not care for the girls maybe they could live with grandma and op could pay for a nanny? Of course this is all about what boundaries op has regarding the money as that can be a slippery slope.", "You know you were far better equipped to be a foster parent at 21.  It sounds like op knows they are not equipped or willing to be a foster parent at 21.

A foster family with a picket fence, backyard and a dog may be a much better choice.", "At age 21, OP and probably husband are just out if their childhoods themselves. It seems likely that they liked each other from the start because they were both determined not to be dragged down by their families' messes. They were children themselves when these two children were born. \"For the sake of the kids\"---when did OP and her husband magicly become people whose futures we're no longer supposed to care about?\n\nOn getting away from the messy situations they were born into, OP and husband most likely vowed no children for another ten years, and maybe never. Now this sub is saying for the better future of the sisters Mr and Mrs OP should take them in. So where do the OP couples' hard work and ambition go from here? Taking in those kids---and the phrase \"developmental difficulties\" has not been uttered, but with an addict mother, c'mon---dumps the OPs right back into what they've been trying to escape. It's easy to imagine that in the eyes of OP and husband, those children will bring nothing but trouble with them.", "OP said they're \"not parent material\". That's different from being \"not ready\". Some people are just not cut out to be parents, like OP, OP's husband, OP's SIL, and the MIA biological father of the nieces. Luckily OP & husband had the foresight to know and not have children, unlike the latter couple.", "Bless you brave soul for doing that. I couldn\u2019t. I know people have kids young, but not everyone is ready emotionally. I feel for all of them with their situation (and yours). It\u2019s a mess. The issue I see for them is that finances don\u2019t equal emotional care, or any discipline that the children may need while going through this horrific time.", "The sad thing is.... yes it really is. The statistics are aweful, the stories are true.", "I agree with you, as others have said children know when they are not truly wanted. Perhaps since OP and her husband know they\u2019re not ready for children/may never want them, they will not be able to provide the mental and emotional support that these children need. This can be just as damaging as living in an abusive home. I know many people who\u2019s parents met the financial and physical needs, however they lacked greatly emotionally and mentally for their children. My father and his siblings are a great example of this, they all turned out to stick their head in the sand with substances because they had no idea how to deal with emotions, conflict, healthy relationships love, etc", "Yep.

I'd barely be chill with them *having their own kids.* They don't need to be taking in two little girls who had a hard life and are (no offense to the girls it isn't their fault) likely poorly behaved due to parental neglect. Then adding in the trauma of their mom dying.\n\nAm I the only one suspect about MIL not being able to take in the girls due to FILs health? How old are these guys? Their kids were kid twenties, so early sixties, max? How sick is he *really?* How much care can he really need that an experienced woman whose already raised kids can't take in her two school age grandkids?", "I turned 30 in December. I am still a baby.", "I'm 38. Can't imagine a child. Will never have one.", "She also mentioned that she is very young. Being part of family that did take guardianship over two blood brothers who were in foster care at ages 2 and 4, (later 5 and 7)\u2026 they still did not end up okay despite us giving them all the love and opportunities in the world. My parents were in their mid-40\u2019s and it was a nightmare for them. I can\u2019t imagine being that young and expected to take on two children who have clearly had the same life that most children end up in foster care for. I don\u2019t know if I would use the term \u201cbetter off\u201d, but maybe they actually could find someone for them who would take better care of them emotionally than a 21 year old could. I\u2019ve definitely seen it happen, sadly it was not that way for us.", "This. It's not OP's fault that the foster care system sucks. It's often a needed thing and it's supposed to be doing its job well. The fact that it doesn't shouldn't be an excuse to offload those responsibilities on private individuals, especially those not properly equipped for them. The real solution would be to stop accepting a broken foster care system as normal.

They're maybe early sixties at the oldest.", "Them being newlyweds and 21 doesn't make them implicitly ill-equipped to parent was my point. The grandmother may/may not better equipped to take the children, but neither can.", "Yes, the real solution to these kinds of issues on a systemic level is *to demand a better foster system that can actually do the job its intended to do.*\n\nWe've accepted a broken system to the point where we've also excepted the expectation that people should bend over backward to work around it rather than relying on something that's supposed to be there to serve the public good and vulnerable populations and that just allows the problems to fester.", "Absolutely \ud83d\udcaf.

I do wonder what steps she did or didn't take to pull her daughter out of the spiral of drug abuse when she was a pregnant teenager (16 or 17, by my calculation). How is it that the grandparents haven't taken an active role until now, when their only attempt at an active role is to attempt to foist their grandchildren on their other child, who is only about twice the age of the eldest.", "That's the other thing I think people are glossing over here. These are two kids that have already likely experienced a lifetime of trauma and will likely have many very specific challenges as a result.

Very hard adopting and adjusting.  You truly have to do it for the kids and not your own savior complex.  \n\nNTA for knowing your boundaries and sticking to it.", "But the odds are already bad, their mom was a drug addicted that died at 26.

And then the kiddo smears shit all over the bathroom or punches a hole in the wall and they bail. It\u2019s truly tough work. Ultimately, probably worth it. But it is so much harder to hang in there than people realize.", "\"Family first\" is not an obligation AT ALL. It's a manipulation and a seriously toxic and gross phrase meant to control and shame. \n\nOther than that, I agree, the MIL is no better than OP. Actually she's worse as she's being manipulative and trying to shame OP into doing the thing that she herself doesn't want to do.", "THIS.

Now everyone is focused on the bad part, which is high in the news and should be cause no one should bring harm to kids, but it also means you don't hear the good stories. The ones where people get a good home, a nice family, and a good life. Every coin has two sides, one side sees the light while the other one stays in the shadow. \n\nAlso, most horror stories I've heard about the system are mostly USA based, there have been a few bad stories here, but nothing as bad as I've heard from the USA.\n\nI don't wish to talk down on anyone with a bad experience in the system nor say that those experiences don't exist. I only wanted to say that good experiences exist as well.\n\nEdit: spelling and adding the last paragraph"]}
