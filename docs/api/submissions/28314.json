We live in an apartment together this year but we\u2019ve lived on campus forming together for two years. When we moved to an actual apartment, we all decided to pitch in and share appliances and material to make the cost of living easier. \n\nSo of course I move in fully ready, with one pan, one pot, a cutting board, knifes, measuring cups, spoons, bowls, rice cooker, grill press, etc. One of my roommates bought some pots and pans and utensils, and the other bought NOTHING because she didn\u2019t plan on cooking. They basically shared my cutting board, knifes, measuring cup, appliances, and later kitchenware i\u2019d end up buying. \n\nThe roommate who decided she wasn\u2019t gone cook suddenly got the idea that she wanted to learn how to cook. Of course at the expense of my kitchenware. I showed her how to make a fried egg, and I assumed she\u2019d know how to use basic appliances. Boy was I wrong. \n\nA few weeks in, my nonstick pan is completely scratched up and the base of it is peeling off. She was using forks to stir and she didn\u2019t think she\u2019d need oil because the pan was non stick. She would also use my grill press for her sandwiches but never cleaned it. I hid my very expensive olive oil in my cabinet because I only intended on using it, yet somehow it\u2019s half gone. \n\nMy other roommate began to use my spices and I assumed it would be a quick thing for one dish that they were missing the spice to- but somehow my individual spices became communal despite us never mentioning it would. \n\nI keep a mini fridge in my room as I have a lot of food, but occasionally I keep a huge box of butter in the main fridge, which also somehow finished despite me using it once to make a pie crust. \n\nMy knives became dull from miss use, my cutting board had holes poked and deep cuts, overall just disrespect. \n\nI went home for break and in the meantime, my mom gifted me an air fryer. I came back to our apartment and as soon as I walked in the door, my two roommates were so excited because now \u201cwe have an air fryer!\u201d\n\nI told them no, it\u2019s mine, and I only want to use it. They were upset but shrugged it off. Of course I find out a week later that the smoke alarm went off when someone incorrectly tried making chicken nuggets in my airfryer (not me) \n\nI had enough and moved all my appliances and food into my room. \n\nSince my crop mates have been calling me a bitch and an aasshole. But I have had enough. They thinks it\u2019s unfair that I take away my stuff now especially since they weren\u2019t given the opportunity to buy replacement materials as I abruptly took it away. \n\nAm I the asshole for repossessing my appliances?", "created_utc": 1696522622, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/170m29f/aita_for_repossessing_my_kitchenware_for_myself/", "score": 65, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your roomies are going to hate you for taking back your things. There is no two ways about this. The sad lesson here is don\u2019t have anything nice in share houses\u2026", "NTA, and oh good grief, your roommates can replace any  of that stuff in a matter of days. They just like the part where you provide everything and they ruin it out of carelessness!", "NTA\n\nThey're openly taking advantage of you. And they can go out and buy replacements now.", "NTA not only does this stuff belong to you, but they were misusing it, using/eating your food and not replacing it. It\u2019s not your responsibility to feed them and provide them with cookware.", "NTA - technically, but I do wonder what conversations you\u2019re having about this stuff. Some people just dont know any better, doesnt make you an AH but you maybe should have said something about this a while ago", "NTA, if they wanted to keep using your stuff they should have treated it with more care. However, I would say you're a bit naive to have brought in all the kitchenware, I mean anyone would have predicted this is how things would have gone \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23. Next time you should get everyone to pitch in to buy the communal items, that way you can't get all upset if they break something.", "NTA, the rule with borrowing somebody else's belongings for personal use, is to return them in pristine condition. They actually damaged tf out of your stuff, you are within your rights to believe that they will continue to damage your utensils. You are allowed to want to keep safe objects that you spent YOUR money on. They're complete bs, move out damn.", "NTA - those items are yours and if they are misused, you have every right to take them away from those misusing them. HOWEVER: you have to accept that your flatmates won\u2019t necessarily see it that way, and will view you as the one in the wrong. I guess it\u2019s weighing up whether you can tolerate the rest of the two years with them thinking that of you (and probably treating you accordingly) or whether you can come to some kind of compromise to make the time living together a bit more bearable.", "NTA, but seriously you need to consider ending this roommate thing to people more compatible with you.  I would inform the others ... anything ruined or used needs to be replaced, you are not their mama.", "NTA they were destroying your stuff", "NTA. Exactly how long do your roommates think it will take them to buy \u201creplacements\u2019 of your materials you removed from the kitchen? A hour to go to Walmart? Two days from Amazon?  Time to regroup : \u201cPitch in and share\u201d does not mean *you* purchase appliances, materials, etc. and *they* use them.", "NTA. They are not mature enough to be living on their own. Too bad you can't send them packing.", "This is a tricky situation.  You want to have a good living situation and good friendships, but you also need to do as much as possible to set expectations, and nothing of what you have described shows that you did this.  You expected people who you knew did not cook to know how to use cooking items.  Sure, there is an expectation of common courtesy, but they are young and immature, and probably take these things for granted when it comes to cooking.\n\nNext time you live with people, take the time to sit down at the beginning and come up with ground rules on shared spaces, shared items, etc.  \n\nAlso, be pro-active in communicating, rather than reactive when at all possible.  For example, you could have said or done these things to ward off problems:\n\n* \"Hey guys, I bought some expensive spices, butter and olive oil for some special things I'm going to make so unless you can replace them with the same thing, please don't use.  And don't worry, I plan to share my creations with you.\"\n* With a girl who does not cook, you should have explained the basics with Teflon and metal utensils being a no-no.  I would tell you to look at this opportunity as a blessing in disguise though as non-stick surfaces are the worst things you can use.  The coating is carcinogenic.  Move to stainless steel.\n* Get a knife sharpener and show your roommates how to use it.\n* Let the cutting board go.  That's what they are for, and not worth complaining about as it will still last a long time in its current condition.\n* And as for the air fryer, I would have probably kept that at home given all of the other ways they had annoyed you with their use of your stuff.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

That's all there is to it, but I have some thoughts. \n\nYes you did move in with the expectation of sharing cookware however that agreement was immediately broken by the roomie that didn't contribute. There is a silent expectation that when someone uses your things they don't damage them intentionally or replace things damaged accidentally. And respect your property which was also broken by the damage she caused. Then of course you have the typical using other peoples food which is just disrespectful. \n\nI think your entitled \"friends\" should find their own place, It's always a joke when people get mad at you for not letting them steal from you and damage your property. The gall of some people.\n\nPersonal rant - I might be biased, got to \"using forks to stir\" and \"nonstick pan is scratched up\" and immediately got rage flashbacks to a similar situation. I swear some people are born wrong. You do NOT use metal in your nonstick cookware, or at all if you can help it. Hardest thing you should use in a pan is wood. They make safe cooking utensils out of silicone now, No excuses. Fork in a nonstick should be a crime. She should be in jail, Go straight to jail, Do not pass go, Do not collect 200 dollars. Jail. I cannot imagine what your knives look like if this is how they treat pans and don't clean the appliances.", "NTA, & time to find new roommates.", "NTA.  They've had all the time you've been together to get their own stuff and chose not to.  I'm sure there was a store were open when you were moving the items to your room.", "Nta did you raise a house issue over one of them going into your room to help themselves to our good oil?  I hope you raised hell over that lack of breach of privacy and get a lock for your door.  Get a small security camera to monitor your room and go after any roommates breaching you privacy.", "How can someone not use an air fryer? I thought they were basically as easy as possible? \n\nNTA. They shouldn't have broken and trashed your things. How the hell did they put holes in your cutting board?", "mm but you must consider that the peace within the apartment would be broken- she probably didn't say anything for that reason :(", "I did show her how to use the non stick pan fully. I told her on multiple occasions before taking away not to use metal spoons or a wool sponge to clean it. She keeps doing it as she thinks she can get away from it, so I know that wasn\u2019t a lack of communication. \n\nThe other things. I could\u2019ve definitely communicated better. \n\nI\u2019ll work on getting stainless steel pans, thank you for that advice! Still I\u2019ll keep it away from them!", "That's why you should always avoid having roommates or at the very least move in with people you have no problem with pissing off.", "Stainless steel or cast iron, but the cast iron is a bit of a hassle, I LOVE cooking with it, because the way it can cook evenly and can go in the oven.", "You can still damage stainless in the same way, it just takes longer. I would just avoid giving them access to things you want kept in good condition. It sucks but they clearly don't respect you or your property."]}
