I'm not getting married anytime soon but I plan to in the future and I want to wear my grandma's dress to my wedding.\u00a0\n\nMy cousin, Jake (26m), is getting married to his fianc\u00e9, Lily (25f), late next year. Jake reached out to last week, which was weird because we are not close at all. He said that he had seen the dress before I inherited from our grandma and he wanted his fianc\u00e9 to wear it to their wedding. I told him that the answer would probably be no, and he was pretty upset about it.\n\nI decided to hear him out, he said that his fianc\u00e9 would tell me her plans for alterations and stuff. Lily\u00a0 called me the next day and to sum it up she pretty much wanted to cut up the dress, dye it and completely change the bodice. I told Lily that her plans were not ok w/ me and she pretty much said \"I'm just going to give it to my future daughter/daughter-in-law so I wouldn't want you wearing it\".\n\nI was shocked by this bitch\u2019s entitlement and I told her the since it was my grandma's dress I would want her wearing it as it would take away from the sentimentality for me. I also told her that even if I did let her wear the dress there was no chance that I would let her keep it. Lily saidit would be great\u00a0 since the dress would be free and her mum could do the alterations. I hung up when she started crying because I couldn't take anymore of this girl's shit.\n\nJake blew up my phone and told me that I'm such a bitch for making Lily cry and I shouldn't have made them think there was a chance they could have the dress. I told Jake that at first I might have been a chance but by the time Lily called I had made my decision. Jack blew up saying that I shouldn't rob his fianc\u00e9 of the opportunity for the perfect dress, ect. I told him that the reason for my decision was that I was planning to wear it to my future wedding, that the dress was important to me and I didn\u2019t want to wear a dress that had been worn by someone else so recently. He said some bs like \u201cour grandma might not even be there when you get married so why not let Lily wear it\u201d.\n\nI texted him (I might have gone too far but I was pissed) saying that Lily wasn't part of the family and that the dress meant nothing to her and didn't have the value to her that it had to me, I didn't want someone to take that away from me. I called my grandma about this and she said that I shouldn\u2019t give it to them as she didn\u2019t want Jake's fianc\u00e9 to wear the dress because she barely knew her.\n\nSince then Jake and Lily have both been blowing up my msgs and instagram dms and Lily's parents even dmed me, I\u2019ve ignored all of it as its just them being pissed and begging for the dress.\u00a0\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1671703073, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zsid57/aita_for_not_giving_my_cousin_a_wedding_dress_i/", "score": 451, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Hell no.  That dress belongs to you.  You can do whatever you want with it, and are not obligated to give it to anyone, especially not some entitled jerk who is not even related to your grandma.  Lily and her family members can go dig in their own closets for a dress for her to mangle, or she can go look at thrift shops.", "NTA \n\nThey want the destroy the dress", "Even your grandma is saying she can't have the dress. Jake and Lily can go elsewhere. Don't expect an invite though.\n\nNTA", "She wants your dress to destroy it and never return it, NTA. Put your dress under key.", "I said no. No is a complete sentence. Grams said no, because she doesn't know Lily. Get your entitled selfs tf out my DM.\n\nBlock everyone. NTA", "Also she doesn\u2019t want to borrow it, she wants to mutilate it, keep it, and pass it on to her hypothetical future daughter. Wha??? NTA", "NTA\n\nThey want your dress for free and to heavily alter it into something completely different. \n\n>she pretty much said \"I'm just going to give it to my future daughter/daughter-in-law so I wouldn't want you wearing it\".\n\nAnd they don't even want to return it to you?! Nope. Absolutely not. Put that dress somewhere where they'll never find it. \n\n\n>I called my grandma about this and she said that I shouldn\u2019t give it to them as she didn\u2019t want Jake's fianc\u00e9 to wear the dress because she barely knew her.\n\nIt's your dress AND grandma doesn't want them to have it. Tell the whole lot of them to shove it.", "She wants to totally destroy the dress and not return it to you and they think YOU are the AH? yeah no- NTA and don't let them make you feel bad. They are way out of line.", "NTA it\u2019s a perfect dress I\u2019m just going to completely change it and basically destroy it and you won\u2019t get it back.\n\nLol no x", "NTA. Tell your parents, Jake\u2019s parents, and your grandmother about this behavior. Take screenshots. Your family deserves to know how horrible Jake and his fianc\u00e9e are being to their family.", "Definitely NTA OP. Not only does she want to dye and cut up the dress but she also states that she would plan to give it to her daughter and she would not give it back to you and wouldn't want you to wear it. She is literally wanting to take it, make it her own and give it to someone else.\n\nClearly your grandma does not want her to have it, she said that! If they keep pushing, tell them that, and from that point don't say another word about it!", "They could always get a thrift store dress or even a cheap new one at a discount place if they want to destroy a dress", "It's perfect because it's free. OP was right to say no. NTA", "They should just go to a thrift store, there are plenty of super cheap wedding dresses to alter", "OP should just buy some cheap white dress from goodwill and see if they even know the difference. It doesn't sound like they'd be keeping much of the dress anyway", "My take was she thinks it's perfect because it's free not because she likes it.", "Indeed, if you literally called you up with a verbal list of alterations, they only want it because it's free and to spit on Grandma who went out of her way to give it to you", "I was going to say that too me and my mom always goes to Goodwill  and I seen lots of wedding dress there  why she got there. Agreeing with u op nta but your entitled  cousin  and his wife is ta.", "They also want to keep it and not allow OP to wear it either.  That definitely puts them into AH territory", "LOL   I hope she does this. They sound horrible", "I'd answer every message with a recounting of how gma said \"what\u203d no, I barely know lily\"\n\n& then escalate to how cousin said \"gma's not even gonna be alive to see you married in it\""]}
