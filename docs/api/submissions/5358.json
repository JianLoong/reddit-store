I'm not getting married anytime soon but I plan to in the future and I want to wear my grandma's dress to my wedding.\u00a0\n\nMy cousin, Jake (26m), is getting married to his fianc\u00e9, Lily (25f), late next year. Jake reached out to last week, which was weird because we are not close at all. He said that he had seen the dress before I inherited from our grandma and he wanted his fianc\u00e9 to wear it to their wedding. I told him that the answer would probably be no, and he was pretty upset about it.\n\nI decided to hear him out, he said that his fianc\u00e9 would tell me her plans for alterations and stuff. Lily\u00a0 called me the next day and to sum it up she pretty much wanted to cut up the dress, dye it and completely change the bodice. I told Lily that her plans were not ok w/ me and she pretty much said \"I'm just going to give it to my future daughter/daughter-in-law so I wouldn't want you wearing it\".\n\nI was shocked by this bitch\u2019s entitlement and I told her the since it was my grandma's dress I would want her wearing it as it would take away from the sentimentality for me. I also told her that even if I did let her wear the dress there was no chance that I would let her keep it. Lily saidit would be great\u00a0 since the dress would be free and her mum could do the alterations. I hung up when she started crying because I couldn't take anymore of this girl's shit.\n\nJake blew up my phone and told me that I'm such a bitch for making Lily cry and I shouldn't have made them think there was a chance they could have the dress. I told Jake that at first I might have been a chance but by the time Lily called I had made my decision. Jack blew up saying that I shouldn't rob his fianc\u00e9 of the opportunity for the perfect dress, ect. I told him that the reason for my decision was that I was planning to wear it to my future wedding, that the dress was important to me and I didn\u2019t want to wear a dress that had been worn by someone else so recently. He said some bs like \u201cour grandma might not even be there when you get married so why not let Lily wear it\u201d.\n\nI texted him (I might have gone too far but I was pissed) saying that Lily wasn't part of the family and that the dress meant nothing to her and didn't have the value to her that it had to me, I didn't want someone to take that away from me. I called my grandma about this and she said that I shouldn\u2019t give it to them as she didn\u2019t want Jake's fianc\u00e9 to wear the dress because she barely knew her.\n\nSince then Jake and Lily have both been blowing up my msgs and instagram dms and Lily's parents even dmed me, I\u2019ve ignored all of it as its just them being pissed and begging for the dress.\u00a0\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1671703073, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zsid57/aita_for_not_giving_my_cousin_a_wedding_dress_i/", "score": 2129, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
