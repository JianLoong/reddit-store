I'm not getting married anytime soon but I plan to in the future and I want to wear my grandma's dress to my wedding.\u00a0\n\nMy cousin, Jake (26m), is getting married to his fianc\u00e9, Lily (25f), late next year. Jake reached out to last week, which was weird because we are not close at all. He said that he had seen the dress before I inherited from our grandma and he wanted his fianc\u00e9 to wear it to their wedding. I told him that the answer would probably be no, and he was pretty upset about it.\n\nI decided to hear him out, he said that his fianc\u00e9 would tell me her plans for alterations and stuff. Lily\u00a0 called me the next day and to sum it up she pretty much wanted to cut up the dress, dye it and completely change the bodice. I told Lily that her plans were not ok w/ me and she pretty much said \"I'm just going to give it to my future daughter/daughter-in-law so I wouldn't want you wearing it\".\n\nI was shocked by this bitch\u2019s entitlement and I told her the since it was my grandma's dress I would want her wearing it as it would take away from the sentimentality for me. I also told her that even if I did let her wear the dress there was no chance that I would let her keep it. Lily saidit would be great\u00a0 since the dress would be free and her mum could do the alterations. I hung up when she started crying because I couldn't take anymore of this girl's shit.\n\nJake blew up my phone and told me that I'm such a bitch for making Lily cry and I shouldn't have made them think there was a chance they could have the dress. I told Jake that at first I might have been a chance but by the time Lily called I had made my decision. Jack blew up saying that I shouldn't rob his fianc\u00e9 of the opportunity for the perfect dress, ect. I told him that the reason for my decision was that I was planning to wear it to my future wedding, that the dress was important to me and I didn\u2019t want to wear a dress that had been worn by someone else so recently. He said some bs like \u201cour grandma might not even be there when you get married so why not let Lily wear it\u201d.\n\nI texted him (I might have gone too far but I was pissed) saying that Lily wasn't part of the family and that the dress meant nothing to her and didn't have the value to her that it had to me, I didn't want someone to take that away from me. I called my grandma about this and she said that I shouldn\u2019t give it to them as she didn\u2019t want Jake's fianc\u00e9 to wear the dress because she barely knew her.\n\nSince then Jake and Lily have both been blowing up my msgs and instagram dms and Lily's parents even dmed me, I\u2019ve ignored all of it as its just them being pissed and begging for the dress.\u00a0\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1671703073, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zsid57/aita_for_not_giving_my_cousin_a_wedding_dress_i/", "score": 1169, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I don't mean to be rude but unless your grandmother was wealthy, her wedding dress from the 1950's couldn't be as complicated as one from today, especially since Lilly wants to totally remodel it. She and her seamstress mother can go thrifting for an old wedding dress to remodel. If her mother is any good at sewing, it shouldn't be that hard.\n\n *Jack blew up saying that I shouldn't rob his fianc\u00e9 of the opportunity for the perfect dress, ect. I told him that the reason for my decision was that I was planning to wear it to my future wedding, that the dress was important to me and I didn\u2019t want to wear a dress that had been worn by someone else so recently. He said some bs like \u201cour grandma might not even be there when you get married so why not let Lily wear it\u201d*\n\nHow is it the 'perfect dress' if it will be totally reworked? She will not be wearing the original dress. And yes your grandmother might not be around physically by the time you get married but her presence will be there in the form of a dress and your memories.\n\n*Since then Jake and Lily have both been blowing up my msgs and instagram dms and Lily's parents even dmed me, I\u2019ve ignored all of it as its just them being pissed and begging for the dress.* \n\nYou said no. The original owner of the dress said no. Tell Jake, Lily and her parents to stop calling you or you will file harassment charges against them. There will be no 'free' dress so Lily and her mother should start shopping now.\n\nNTA", "NTA, Boohoo, Lily doesn't get a free dress she can shred and dye? Tell her to go to a thrift store and stay away from family heirlooms.", "NTA..  Their both just cheap", "NTA. Why on earth would they think that dress should rightfully be theirs? It was willed away to you, not them. Tell them there are thrift stores full of old wedding dresses they can cut and dye to their hearts content!", "NTA\n\nBut make damn sure that dress is in a private and secure location that these entitled AHs can\u2019t access", "NTA - but your cousin and fiance are.  It's been a long time since I've seen that level of entitlement.  BOTH of them have absolutely zero (0) right to come at you like this.  I highly recommend that you tag your cousin and his fiance to this post just so they can see just how big of an AH they really are.  Seriously, show them this post.", "NTA. The second she started talking about chopping up the dress would hav3 been a hard no from me.", "NTA. \n\n'I want to cut up, dye and keep your dress\" is not asking to borrow it even. The entitlement is absurd. She can buy a dress the cut and color she wants. Or ask her own grandma for hers.", "NTA\n\nI just don\u2019t get people like this. A piece of familial history is being passed down. If you need do more than take it in or let it out\u2014it\u2019s really not your perfect dress. Their perfect dress is in their heads and they just see fabric. Find another free in goodwill or something is you can\u2019t go to a shop and order a bespoke one\n\nKeep it as it sounds like you respect the history and fashion/style of dress. Those are beautiful pieces and tend to be pretty delicate", "Esh  But if you had a female cousin and not cousin in law who wanted to wear it and only alter it in minor ways to fit them and had the same reverence for it you do, I would let them wear it.\n\nSaying Lily is not part of the family is where I say ESH.  I would have said she wants to cut up the dress so that is why no", "I\u2019m also wondering why Jake think it\u2019s better for Lily to wear it because they know grandma will be alive for this wedding? Grandma has stated she doesn\u2019t want Lily to wear or change the dress. In her place, I would rather have a blood relative I was close to use it in it\u2019s original state after I passed vs. a nearly stranger use and drastically change it while I\u2019m still alive. Weird argument.", "I want to make sure the OP has that dress in a safe space.", "Also, if she's looking to butcher an existing dress into her perfect dress, go to the thrift store and get a cheap and non-sentimental one. The absolute nerve of laying claim to the groom's grandma's vintage dress only to tear it apart when someone else inherited it, loves it, and plans to wear it as-is.", ">If it's the \"perfect dress\" why is she planning to dye and alter it?\n\nIts not the perfect dress. It's the perfect fabric.", "And if her mom can make all those alterations she make the perfect  dress - it would still be cheaper than buying one. My mother made  my sister's wedding dress and it was awesome. NTA", "Exactly, the ONLY thing that makes it the perfect dress for them is because it's free.", "Agree  ,block,block and report  them for harassment on social networks op. Nta", "^^^Exactly", "Yea Lily needs to take her ass to a thrift store.", "I mean that\u2019s just absurd to think that OP wouldn\u2019t want to wear the dress herself one day. No reasonable person would even propose this idea. If you want a free dress, you reach out to the family and ask if anyone has a dress that they don\u2019t want anymore and don\u2019t plan to pass on to their kids. Or you look at the thrift shop for cheap ones. If you can\u2019t afford a thrift shop dress, you shouldn\u2019t be planning a wedding except at the courthouse", "OP needs to hide the dress in a locked box and never let them into the house because they seem the type to steal it.  NTA.  Also, I think OP needs to spread the word about this despicable behavior.", "Exactly, if she wants a dress she can alter for cheap she should go to a second hand store", "This. OP, if any family members harass you, DON'T emphasize that this woman isn't family, emphasize that this woman plans to cut up the dress, dye it, and basically use it for fabric. And that she made it clear what's left will go to her kid and not back to you. That should shut up most people.\n\nBut, also, block the woman and your cousin.", "OP, if you live with family, make sure your parents know that the dress is absolutely off limits for anyone except you.  And if possible hiding it is a great idea, too.\n\nGosh I hope your grandma is so disgusted by your cousin's behavior that he is disinherited.", "And let all family members know that Jack want to:\n\n\n- take your grandma's inheritance from you\n\n\n- cut it, dye it and change the bodice of the dress\n\n\n- pass it for a daughter or DIL potentially leaving the family \n\n\nAnd add that not only grandma reinforced that this is not what she wants to see made of the dress, he's disrespecting her and now even put his in-laws to bully you into giving a family heirloom to their daughter.\n\n\nAnd word it like this, in the most malicious way possible... they want to play with peer pressure? Give them some *real* one to deal with.", "100% hide the dress. Leave it with a trusted friend or relative, DO NOT keep it in your home. If she\u2019s this entitled already who knows what she\u2019ll do, seems like a \u201cif I can\u2019t have it no one can\u201d kind of person.", "Yeah, it would actually be a lot cheaper and a lot less work and weirdly enough, better looking just to get a dress she actually wants.", "I totally concur.
