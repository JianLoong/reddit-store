I'm not getting married anytime soon but I plan to in the future and I want to wear my grandma's dress to my wedding.\u00a0\n\nMy cousin, Jake (26m), is getting married to his fianc\u00e9, Lily (25f), late next year. Jake reached out to last week, which was weird because we are not close at all. He said that he had seen the dress before I inherited from our grandma and he wanted his fianc\u00e9 to wear it to their wedding. I told him that the answer would probably be no, and he was pretty upset about it.\n\nI decided to hear him out, he said that his fianc\u00e9 would tell me her plans for alterations and stuff. Lily\u00a0 called me the next day and to sum it up she pretty much wanted to cut up the dress, dye it and completely change the bodice. I told Lily that her plans were not ok w/ me and she pretty much said \"I'm just going to give it to my future daughter/daughter-in-law so I wouldn't want you wearing it\".\n\nI was shocked by this bitch\u2019s entitlement and I told her the since it was my grandma's dress I would want her wearing it as it would take away from the sentimentality for me. I also told her that even if I did let her wear the dress there was no chance that I would let her keep it. Lily saidit would be great\u00a0 since the dress would be free and her mum could do the alterations. I hung up when she started crying because I couldn't take anymore of this girl's shit.\n\nJake blew up my phone and told me that I'm such a bitch for making Lily cry and I shouldn't have made them think there was a chance they could have the dress. I told Jake that at first I might have been a chance but by the time Lily called I had made my decision. Jack blew up saying that I shouldn't rob his fianc\u00e9 of the opportunity for the perfect dress, ect. I told him that the reason for my decision was that I was planning to wear it to my future wedding, that the dress was important to me and I didn\u2019t want to wear a dress that had been worn by someone else so recently. He said some bs like \u201cour grandma might not even be there when you get married so why not let Lily wear it\u201d.\n\nI texted him (I might have gone too far but I was pissed) saying that Lily wasn't part of the family and that the dress meant nothing to her and didn't have the value to her that it had to me, I didn't want someone to take that away from me. I called my grandma about this and she said that I shouldn\u2019t give it to them as she didn\u2019t want Jake's fianc\u00e9 to wear the dress because she barely knew her.\n\nSince then Jake and Lily have both been blowing up my msgs and instagram dms and Lily's parents even dmed me, I\u2019ve ignored all of it as its just them being pissed and begging for the dress.\u00a0\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1671703073, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zsid57/aita_for_not_giving_my_cousin_a_wedding_dress_i/", "score": 96, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your cousin is a guy - its not about him wanting to wear his grandmothers dress.\n\nSecond you inherited its your property.\n\nThird - no one should touch it or alter it - until you wear it and its fitted for you and then you will probably hand it down the family line if you have kids\n\nFourth its not a perfect dress if she is cutting it up\n\nFifth doesnt matter if your grandmother isnt at your wedding physically - you wearing the dress makes her be there for you and all the family - its how you will include her.\n\nSixth store it somewhere safe so they dont steal it. Dont store it at your grans or parents - they will steal it\n\nSeventh - block them on your mobile and social media and live your life", "I would put it out there on ur insta. Embarrassing them.

How entitled, and why would she think it's OK to destroy the dress and then not give it back.", "First, nta. Second, you're lucky she is such and entitled asshole.

No reason. They don't get a reason.\n\nIt's your grandmas dress that you plan on wearing to your wedding. Even if your sister asked for it, swore she would take excellent care of it, not alter it...

Your grandmother have you that dress because you adored it as is.  What Lily wants is to not wear that dress but to basically use it as some base to make a new dress.

She doesn't want *that* dress, she just wants a free dress. But she could easily find either a cheep dress to use for her project or find one closer to what she wants without having to freaking *dye* the thing.

Make your own darn history rather than ruin future family relationships!", "Omg yes that too! Boggles the mind that anyone would ask this", "> Block the lot of them\n\nActually, I have a different suggestion for /u/revealrandom. Rather than blocking them, you should troll them by always replying, \u201cI am sorry but who is this? I am not fluent in Entitlementese.\u201d\n\nJust keep on spamming that reply to all their voice and text messages as they grow increasingly deranged in their responses.\n\nThen upload all their unhinged messages into an e-mail to your relatives which explains why you will not be attending their wedding because you do not feel safe around them.\n\nWhat do you have to lose? You are not close with this particular cousin, and this will ensure that his future wife and her parents will avoid you for years to come."]}
