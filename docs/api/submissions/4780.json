It belonged to his mother, who passed away a few years ago, and I was quite touched that he would give me something that important to him and since then I\u2019ve always kept it tied around my purse but the other day it disappeared. I was honestly really upset when I realized it was missing. \n\nYesterday he came to me asking where it was. I didn\u2019t want to admit that I had lost it, especially because I expect it to turn up in the next few days, so I told him that I knew where it was it just wasn\u2019t on my purse at the moment. Then he asked if I could go get it, and I refused (partially because I don\u2019t know where it is but also because his tone was really pissing me off). He then went totally ballistic saying how I was obviously lying and how some medium had told his dad to give it to his mom as a sign of their love, but if she ever lost the scarf it symbolized the end of their relationship and how I must not love him anymore? I do really love and care for my husband but he seemed unreasonably upset. He isn\u2019t usually a superstitious or particularly paranoid guy, so I am concerned but was pretty irritated that he was acting this way over me refusing to go get the scarf?\n\nSince that happened yesterday he hasn\u2019t really cooled off. I have to admit I haven\u2019t seen him much, as he does work a lot, but his behavior is completely different than how he was before this incident.

Honesty is important in relationships. YTA", "I dunno if you're quite TA here, but ... why weren't you just honest with him? That is where I'm concerned.  If you are afraid of his reactions to things, that isn't totally healthy, and is a MUCH bigger issue than losing a scarf.  But, assuming he's normally a reasonable, and loving husband, why didn't you just say, \"Y'know I was wondering that myself! I could swear it was on my purse yesterday and now it isn't. I hope I haven't lost it outside the house.\" So a little bit of asshole for being dishonest with him, but he is also being a bit of one for his response.", "YTA: Your husband is incredibly hurt and is worried about the lost scarf being a sign of the end of your relationship.\n\nYou never mention that you apologized or are doing anything to try to reassure him you love him.\n\nMaybe instead of waiting for it to blow over and for him to get over it you should actively try to find the scarf. Put up posters and post on social media.\n\nApologize to your husband. Put yourself in his shoes and think about what you would want someone to do if you were hurting, sad and your feeling were being blown off by the person you love best.", "YTA, this is a stupid thing to lie about, reminds me of a 5 y/o lying to get out of trouble only to get into more trouble for covering up what they did. I\u2019d be mad if someone misplaced a family heirloom, don\u2019t get me wrong, but I\u2019d be even more angry if they lied to my face about it. There were emotional consequences either way, and you chose to make it worse", "You lied for literally no reason and he blew his top over because you were lying and whatever else had him stressed boiled over as a result.\n\nEdit I changed my mind. YTA. I'm not surprised he lost his shit when you were gaslightung him about his dead moms scarf", "YTA\n\nYou lied to him and still won't come out with the truth.  He gave you something very sentimental to him and maybe you should've put it up and only worn it on special occasions.", "ESH. \n\nYou really shouldn't have lied about it, or hid the loss in the first place. The best course of action would have been to tell him as soon as it went missing and ask for help finding it. \n\nBut that reaction was... intense. He should not be blowing up at you or accusing you of no longer loving him over a scarf, even a sentimental one. \n\nI think he knew you were lying to begin with though, because asking out of the blue like that sounds like a test. It's quite possible that he found the scarf, realized you'd lost it and didn't tell him, then asked you about it to see if you'd come clean. Which is a bit of a shitty thing to do, but would explain his anger at your response.", "ESH you shouldn't have lied. \"Not sure, I tnink it's in the bedroom somewhere.\"", "INFO: Why do you expect something that was \"lost\" to turn up in a few days? \n\nIf you honestly lost it and lied about it, then Y T A. There's no reason to lie.\n\nBut maybe I've read too many reddit stories, because the first thing that came to mind reading this is that your husband intentionally took it without telling you as an excuse to get angry with you.

This is your husband. If you want to build a good relationship you need honesty. This isn\u2019t a little white lie, it\u2019s obviously important to him.
