I could afford 12K to as a gift, but thats still a lot of money that i'd rather keep.

After I told him no, I didn't hear from him until yesterday\n\nHis dog passed  2 weeks ago and he is blaming me.  Yesterday, I heard from him.  He texted me thanking me for killing his dog and called me an asshole. I gave him my condolences but said this is not my fault.

It\u2019s sad his dog passed away, but that is not your fault at all.", "He's in pain. He wants others to share his pain. And I'm guessing he's too chicken to tell your PARENTS that they \"killed his dog\" by not loaning/gifting the money...so YOU got the full brunt of it. Totally unfair. \n\nYou were trying to preserve the relationship by not turning yourself into your brother's creditor. He just blew up that relationship, on purpose, repeatedly. \n\nRefuse to have any more \"constructive conversations\" OP -- he just wants to hurt you. Let him lick his wounds in private -- pay no attention to his accusations, and get on with your life.\n\nNTA", "NTA. 12k is not a solid guarantee that the dog will survive the cancer anyway and then he\u2019ll be asking for more money.  It sucks to lose a pet but sometimes you just have to go through it and enjoy their last moments. \n\nPlus the issue with owing your parents 5 figures? Jesus christ and he wants to borrow 12k??", "NAH - But I think you might find you and your brother do not have a good relationship for quite some time. It was fine for him to ask, it was fine for you to say no and its not right that he blames you. But he loved that dog. And right now he is hurting and part of that hurt is that the people closest to him wouldn't help him save the dog he loved so much. That doesn't imply you did anything wrong, but anger is part of grief. I also find it a little naive of you to think that this wouldn't negatively impact your relationship. You could have helped, you chose not to. Which was within your rights but you cannot be surprised when that choice has a negative consequence for your relationship with your brother.", "NTA for not lending the money. I mean that is a lot of money. But I do get a vibe that you might not understand how important a dog can be to a person and if your brother also saw that \"it's just a dog\" attitude in you, that could be one reason why he is upset with you. When my dog died I mourned harder than I had ever mourned. For a while I thought the grief would kill me. No human death had had such an effect on me. So I hope you see how big of a loss and pain your brother is going through.", "NTA for declining to lend him money. Fair warning, as others have said, it'll hurt yall relationship going forward. \n\nFor those of you saying if you can't pay the medical bills to not get a pet, I agree/disagree. Sometimes those bills get ASTRONOMICAL.  We can plan and save as much as we want but sometimes they get really financially overwhelming. Having a pet is more than feeding and spending time with them. Agreed but don't shame someone for not having 5 figures to pay those bills. Especially in this economy lol. \n\nI had to make a difficult choice to put my pet to sleep while weighing the options of trying to save his life (he had kidney failure and possibly cancer). It's shitty the brother tried to blame his dog's death on OP. He's grieving tho so give him some room to do so. Still check on him because losing a pet that you hold so very close is world shattering (not even being dramatic). It's obvi not your fault his dog died but I'd like you to try to think of it from his perspective...like losing a close family member.", "NAH. 12k is a lot of money, and it\u2019s your right to say no when someone asks for money. Your brother is grieving, and probably lashing out a bit because he felt like it could be fixed, but no one would help him (which, again 12k is a lot no matter your financial situation). Try and give him some grace. Pets tie strings to our hearts in ways we don\u2019t understand until they\u2019re gone. I carried every day for at least month when I lost my first dog.", "NAH because it\u2019s your money ultimately and what you do with it is your choice \n\nBut I don\u2019t think your brother is an AH for being upset. I am a dog person and my dog is like my baby to me - I\u2019d be beyond devastated if I lost my dog. And if I knew a family member could have paid? In my grief yeah I might lash out \n\nI also understand that you feel giving the money could have damaged your relationship with your brother - but not giving has too. I don\u2019t think there really was a winning situation here.\n\nIt was your money and you would rather keep it. That\u2019s fine, that\u2019s your call and your right and refusing to give it either as a loan or a gift does not make you an AH\n\nBut you have to understand that your brother probably sees this as you\u2019d rather have the money than a relationship with him and think money matters more than a member of his family and that\u2019s going to hurt a lot.", "NTA, not even one bit. That is a lot of money and it\u2019s clear it wouldn\u2019t be paid back anytime soon (if at all). And I expect that the surgeries would have only prolonged the dogs life a little bit, the dog was already starting to get old. You can\u2019t be blamed for something that wasn\u2019t your responsibility", "My Judgement is NTA because at the end of the day you don't HAVE to loan anyone any amount of money for anything.    BUT, Personally I think you and your parents are rather heartless and should not be surprised if your relationship with your brother is forever broken by this.  If I needed help to save one of my pets and  was refused by family simply because \"I don't wanna its just a dog...\"  I couldn't see myself interacting with them on any positive level ever again.", "$12K is the start off costs. There is always something else to add to the bill.\n\nIf we are being honest, the dog was always going to die. It died 2 weeks after you refused to pay. That is late stage cancer, surgery doesn\u2019t magically fix that. \n\nYou are being used as the scape goat. He doesn\u2019t want to blame himself for not having pet insurance. \n\nThe dog was his family so you should have been more sincere. \n\nNTA for lending such a large amount of money on something not guaranteed to work.", "NAH - What you do with your money is your choice. But this may have damaged your relationship more then you are aware off, not only because of your refusal but because of your attitude towards all of this.", "NTA", "NTA for not lending the money but pretending like one of my family members lives isn\u2019t as important as a potential future vacation would get you on my short list real quick.", "Not saying it\u2019s your responsibility but I\u2019m going to guess (and this is how it would be with me) you just destroyed your relationship with your brother", "Nta. Not your dog not your responsible. get a dog is not just feeding and play with dog but there a lot of expensive things like vet bills too.", "NTA for not lending the money but and there always is a \"but\", this has hurt your relationship far more than what you were previously worried about. Yes the dog was your brother's responsibility but he treated the dog as family. It doesn't matter how you viewed the dog or even your fears about slow repayment. Your brother asked you for a favor that he felt was very important and you turned him down. This will always hang over your relationship.", "NTA, for future reference you can get health insurance for most pets.", "NTA technically because you\u2019re not obligated to lend someone money. But you\u2019re the AH if you\u2019re surprised he\u2019s angry and that this will affect your relationship. And you\u2019re the ah for your attitude.", "NTA\n\nI guess you valued 12k more than his dog and his happiness and he would value his dog more. Your opinions just vary and it is possible that you lost him over this.\n\nJust for the future: In my country it is possible to make a contract for future inheritance. So you could give him 12k and when you inherit anything you get the 12k back out of his share. Would only work if you are sure to inherit something some day AND if you would be willing to wait until then.", "NTA\n\nNo further comment required", "NTA Your brother just named you scapegoat for his fiscal woes. Not your fault, that is entirely on his shoulders. \n\n>He texted me thanking me for killing his dog and called me an asshole.\n\nIt could be due to his grief. His dog died from cancer, it might have died even with treatment, and it would have eventually died from old age if nothing else.", "NTA it's not your fault he didn't insure his pet.", "NTA. Pet insurance is a thing and he could have paid for a lot of his dog\u2019s care with that but instead he chooses to leech off his family. He needs to grow up.", "NTA. $12k is a lot to ask for, and you don\u2019t owe him anything.", "NTA, it is your brother's responsibility to provide care for his dog.  If he doesn't have any savings and does not have any credit available, then honestly, you are better off saving your money for any number of upcoming crises that your brother may experience\n( his own healthcare issues, housing issues, transportation issues)  \n\nAfter the surgery, the dog may have needed chemo and other care.  There is no guarantee that the dog would have survived or that additional money would not have been needed.", "NTA. Dog/cat lover here. 12k is huge amount and sadly to say the truth is even surgery might not help, especially if dog has passed soon after your conversation with your brother.\n\nBut OP, I recommend you to work on your empathy. \"It is just the dog\" is bit hearthless.", "YTA. Yes you were under no obligation to help, and it's a lot of money. You did nothing technically wrong. But you can afford it and he's your brother and he loved the dog. You didn't help because you didn't give a crap about it and you didn't care, and now he's suffering and grieving, and he'll probably never forgive you.", "NTA. If the brother did not have the financial means to support the dog (or pay pet insurance), then maybe he should not have had the dog. Cancer or other injuries/diseases is just one of the risks faced when caring for any pet.\n\nHowever, it is likely your brother is hurting right now. It is not your fault his dog died, so don't take his remarks personally.", "NTA. I am a dog person and would do anything for my dogs and am very saddened that his did not receive the treatment it needed. However that is not your fault or your parents. If a person who has any animal as a pet is not paying for pet insurance to cover medical bills then they are at fault for any suffering the animal goes through. If you cannot afford to look after an animal properly then you have no business getting an animal.", "NTA. Clearly this is on him.", "NTA - your brother killed that dog the moment he brought it into his life without the ability to financially care for it.\n\nAlso, I didn\u2019t see you mention a gofundme or other funding route - so, it\u2019s not like he really tried or cared that much.\n\nI love dogs, but end of life care for canines is a scam and vets should be better regulated.", "YTA- you could afford it but choose not to try save a member of your brothers family. I don\u2019t see how he or anyone could get past that.", "NTA - This dog was really sick and probably wouldn't have made it through cancer treatment and surgery.

I\u2019m a dog lover but 12K is a ton of money. It\u2019s even worse knowing your brother pays people back pretty slowly and he already is in debt to your parents.

I sure wouldn't take brother's word for it, since denial is absolutely a thing in these situations.

Denial is definitely a thing in these situations.  There's a very good chance the veterinarian recommended euthanasia, and brother just refused to consider doing that.", "This is something that really irks me... And even though I know I'm being irrational, I still can't help but be upset by it.\n\nLet's take something that happened to me recently. I got a $59 parking ticket. Now, unfortunately, I'm poor enough that, $59 is a BIG DEAL. It means, I might be short on rent. It means, I might not be able to eat well enough to sustain myself. But that's MY problem, 100%.\n\nSo I was complaining to my brother that I was super mad at myself for getting the ticket in the first place. And I jokingly asked if he felt like paying it for me. If course he said nope! Fair enough!\n\nBUT he then said that he wanted to take me out to, and pay for, dinner. To a very expensive place. Where just my entree, no drinks no apps, would cost about as much as my ticket that was stressing me TF out.\n\nAnd... While I knew that I was being irrational, I got mad!! I'm sitting there telling him that \"I know I have no reason to be upset with you. But I'm really REALLY mad right now!\"\n\nBecause... I'm in this position of stress and worry because I don't have enough money. I work hard for what I earn. But this unexpected expense came up, which is my own fault, and I will have to sacrifice some necessity to cover it.\n\nHe has the money. Enough that spending that much is nothing to him. He's willing to spend it. He's willing to spend it ON ME. He's just not willing to spend it on my necessity, but he IS willing to spend it, on me, on a luxury. Of course it's his and he can do whatever he wants with it. It's still fucking infuriating though.", "The dog died only a few weeks after brother asked for the money, so it's likely the cancer was advanced.
