Now I thought this was ridiculous; he needs to come back and see his parents more often. Like at least once a month, even for a few days. Toronto and Quebec City are like 9 hours away and he has fleixibility to work from home. He also has the income to afford this; he just makes it harder on himself by refusing to buy a car (he took the train back here). If he lives in Vancouver or something I'd get it - flying back once a year may make sense due to cost - but even then I would say do twice a year\n\nHe also said that he is trying to integrate and establish a life there and that coming back all the time would get in the way. That he calls home everyday. But I pointed out that it is not the same. And again he is not all the far away; he should see his parents; you don't know how long they will be around. And BTW I am not a hypocrite. I live in 9 hours away in Northern Ontario for work and drive back every other weekend.\n\nThe rest of our law school friend group agreed (well not sure about the groom since he wasn't at our table of course).

We\u2019re in our 30s and it\u2019s a pretty straight shot on the interstate highway but damn it\u2019s just a lot of driving and so we don\u2019t do it unless we can stay for more than a day, because we lose two full days to driving. With food breaks and stretching or walking the dog a few times it\u2019s a long ass haul. \n\nEven if we could take a train, it\u2019d still be two days lost to travel.", "Who else sucks?", "I am a Canadian from Ontario and think you are spot on. If you are talking about cultural life, stuff to do on the weekend, etc. northern Ontario has nothing on Toronto, while Quebec City is at least a major city/capital with stuff going on, and if you want to hit a major city than\nMontreal is much closer than Toronto.\n\nI find it very weird that OP can\u2019t see this.

You are being an absolute star seeing them as much as you do.\n\nMy mum was like yours - she would only have been happy if I had married a local lad, lived round the corner and seen her every single day. It didn't work out like that - I met my husband when I moved away for university and made my life in another part of the country with him - and she never forgave me for it.\n\nMy wish for you is that you can stop feeling guilty - you have nothing to feel guilty for - and are able to relax, enjoy your family and let your mother's comments roll off you like water off a duck's back. Please look up the FOG - fear, obligation, guilt - and what you can do to get free of it. \n\nAs for \"who will look after them\" - that's an awful thing to say to you. That shouldn't be why we have children. If anything happens you'll help them, sure, but you have your own life and you should be living it and enjoying it.\n\nGood luck.

If we did have to, that would probably ring alarm bells for us.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy parents are both dead now, do I wish I had gone to see them more? Honestly - no. I loved my parents, I still do. Family get togethers were fantastic (and still are, we are just missing two people).
