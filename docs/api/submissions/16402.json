Toronto and Quebec City are like 9 hours away and he has fleixibility to work from home. He also has the income to afford this; he just makes it harder on himself by refusing to buy a car (he took the train back here).

Mind ya own.", "Yta it's literally none of your business", "YTA.  You don't know the inner family dynamic, only the public presenting part where everyone appears nice.  He's doing what works for him and his family. And it's none of your business.\n\nHow about an example?  \nI could say your visiting schedule seems excessive, like is that cord to your mommy still in tact?  From there I could go into the you're probably still single cause no one could ever be as good as whichever parent you are overly attached to.  Then my \"friendly life advice\" would be cut the cord, and learn to live your own life.  And that would all make me the ahole because much like you I don't know your actual family dynamic and it's none of my business.", "YTA he\u2019s an adult leave him alone", "YTA and his relationship with his family is none of your business. Maybe he doesn\u2019t have the same type of relationship with them that you have with yours. It\u2019s possible there could be a dynamic between them they don\u2019t share with outsiders. Which is what you are. So see yourself out of this situation. \n\nI honestly cannot stand people like OP. Not everyone has the same connection to their parents. If his parents have a problem with this, THEY can tell him. You can concentrate on your relationships. Which you damaged with this friend by the way. I will tell you right now, any friend of mine butted into my family dynamic like this they would be an ex-friend.", "YTA. It is literally none of your business.", "YTA\n\nOk, I'm going to tell you what you need to do with your life because it's going to be really helpful advice. You need to start dating Mary, because she really likes you. You should date for several years, then get married, and have two kids. And a cat. You should buy a house too. I mean, it's not that hard and you have the means to do so.", "YTA it\u2019s not for you to dictate how someone should live their lives. Maybe his parents are OK with once a year, they can alway go visit him as well. You were out of line for giving him grief over it. My sister moved 6 hrs away and never comes to see us unless it\u2019s for a specific occasion, my mom has to go to her and my mom is ok with that", "This is a CLASSIC case of \u201cmind yo damn business\u201d \nYTA", "YTA", "YTA. His relationship with his parents is NONE of YOUR business.", "Yta, you sound insufferable", "Dude in what world do you live in where everyone can see there parents once a month? Maybe this dude doesn\u2019t have a hood relationship with them, or that he actually doesn\u2019t have as much money as you think he does. Also him getting or not getting a car doesn\u2019t require you to have an opinion on the matter", "YTA it's not any of your business, and giving unsolicited advice and getting everyone to agree with you (which I doubt) against him was just flat out rude.  Leave the guy alone.  \n\nYou really drive 9 hours each way, every other weekend?  How do you have any kind of relaxation time or social life where you live?", "YTA.  My parents live three hours away and I barely see them once a year.   Because I don\u2019t want to.  They\u2019re fine.  Everything\u2019s fine.  But I don\u2019t want to.  I like my house.  That\u2019s enough of a reason and you should mind your own business.", "YTA, is this any of your business? Your friend could have plenty of reasons for not coming home constantly, and is he not allowed to move away and start a life with his new wife?", "Wow how presumptuous of you to tell him how he should manage his life. If this is the best way for HIM to adjust to his working life in a new city so be it. That's not useful life advice you gave that was insinuating that he's not a good son if he doesn't come home every month to see his parents. What if his parents have a life of their own and don't want him home as much? What if they have plans to come out and see him? I know this is a snippet of a Convo you have given us but what you gave doesn't make a good case for your stance. YTA.", "YTA\n\nWhatever the reason, whatever the circumstance, it is his choice how often or not he goes back to visit his parents, or even how often he talks to them.\n\nAnd on top of that, it's also not a matter that affects or concerns you, so why are you trying to tell him how he should live his life? He could have simply just said \"I don\u2019t plan on coming back often\" and left it at that, and not given you an explanation, and you would still be the asshole here.", "YTA. Butt out and mind your own business.", "> How on earth does this affect you?\n\nTrying to give some helpful life advice", "Followed by sorry, I hope!\n\nYup, OP, YTA.", "As an American, this upsets me greatly and ruins my whole perception of Canadians being overly kind and accommodating.", "To the best of my knowledge yes. I mean eveyryone has problems but his parents are loving and all", "Yeah NAH for discussing it, it's good for friends to offer advice. But once the friend pushed back and gave their reasons, OP is TA for continuing to push the issue. You gotta drop it and accept it's not your decision and there could be a lot more going on that is none of your business.", "The fuck? No he doesn't. Dude is an adult and can decide how often, if at all, he wants to come back and visit his parents.", "Here\u2019s some helpful life advice for you - mind your own business", "No. You were judging him and mocking his choices. That's not helpful.", "That's not advice, that's your opinion.", "YTA, Did he ask for your advice? If he didn't, then it's not helpful it's unsolicited advice. Did he ask your opinion, no? So mind your business & worry about your visits with your family. He's a grown ass man he can see his parents as much as he wants. Focus on the road & stay in your lane.", "YTA, nobody asked", "There\u2019s a great big difference between trying to give helpful advice and what you\u2019re actually doing: trying to push your opinion of how to do things on others, then having the nerve to be indignant when they don\u2019t agree with you. Mind your own business. YTA", "If he had said \u201cI want to see my parents more\u201d and you suggested a credit card that got airline miles for the route he needed, that would be advice. You\u2019re giving him information to help him accomplish his goal. Telling someone to live their life differently isn\u2019t advice, it\u2019s rude.", "You do realize not everybody's family dynamics are the same as yours, right? And that that's perfectly okay? I mean seriously dude it's so not any of your business, and for all you know it's actually better for their relationship not to spend every God damn weekend together. That's a freaking lot.", "If he didn't ask it's not \"helpful\" it's sticking your nose in where it's not wanted. You're rude and incredibly condescending\n\nEdit: YTA", "UNSOLICITED \"advice\". He doesn't need you telling him what to do with HIS LIFE. Grow up and butt out. You can cling to mommy and daddy if that makes you happy but it's not weird for your ADULT friend to want HIS OWN life. Why are you so obsessed with him and his personal affairs?", "18 hours of round trip driving once a month?? That\u2019s you\u2019re great life advice? Hell no.", "No one asked for your advice.  This is none of your business. YTA.", "Unwanted and unneeded", "I'm sorry, but I missed the part where he asked for your advice. It's very presumptuous to take it upon yourself to tell someone how to live their life when they didn't even ask you. YTA. Keep your opinions to yourself. Most people don't appreciate unsolicited advice.", "You do realise not everyone likes their parents... right?\n\n\nYTA", "Sorry, YTA. \n\nYou have no idea what his relationship is with his parents. But regardless, you don't get to dictate what other people do.", "No one asked for your \u2018helpful\u2019 life advice. Here is some helpful life advice right back at you: No one likes unsolicited advice.", "Some people don't want to see their parents, Steve.", "Did they ask? No? Then STFU", "Many times, unsolicited advice tends to be trash. Stop doing it.", "And... You know his relationship with his parents better than him, how?", "\n>*Trying to give some helpful life advice*\n\nMind your own damn business. Seriously.", "You have no idea what his relationship with his family is..  what if he is trying to establish health boundaries with an enmeshed mother. We never know what happens behind close doors \n\nOr maybe he isn\u2019t close to his parents\nMaybe he is trying to save up for a home \nMaybe he is trying to find the one\nMaybe he is Peking a lot to mow partner \u2026", "Did anyone ask for your advice? Because here\u2019s some \u201chelpful life advice\u201d NO ONE WANTS UNSOLICITED ADVICE.", "YTA.\n\nSince you like Unsoliticated advice, here's some, Just because your family bonds are so weak you need to physical interaction to keep it up is not his problem. \n\nHe lives in Quebec city, nothing like whatever boring northern Ontario town you're living in where nothing happens. Even if you're in Greater Sudbury, biggest city in the north, it has less going on then Quebec City.", "Haha. It is an overused saying here. And due to the amount we say sorry. Apologies can\u2019t be used against a person in court. \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23", ">To the best of my knowledge\n\nSo you don't actually know for certain. Not every family issue is evident to people outside the family. And even if it is a good relationship and he'd rather not see them so frequently, it's none of your business.", "So you have no idea. My mother is outwardly loving and everyone loves her, but being around her is terrible for my mental health so I only go back to my hometown once a year - if that. \n\nYou have no idea what the true dynamics are of someone\u2019s relationship with their parents, and it\u2019s none of your business.", "Why don't you go visit his parents twice a month then? You're so obsessed with them why aren't you volunteering to go there?", "Yeah\u2026.. that\u2019s what people thought of mine too. Dad was charismatic and funny. Everyone loved him. Didn\u2019t know he basically lived in a bottle and took out his problems on his wife and kids until mom actually divorced him. Everyone was SHOCKED to find out he was massively abusive. \n\nSo yeah\u2026. Mind your own business.", "No it\u2019s not good to be offering advice without being asked to or if it\u2019s a dire situation. Learn to mind your business being friends doesn\u2019t mean you can open your mouth on every subject you feel like", "Hahahahah", "Sorry \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83c\udde8\ud83c\udde6"]}
