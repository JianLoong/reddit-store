OP is the oldest, and should be treated as such. It's insulting to be treated as lower than your younger siblings in your own parents' house. I would not have been nearly as gracious as OP.", "NAH, I sleep on a sofa at my parent's everything I visit. My sister and brother in law have her old room, my niece has mine and I get the sofa. It's no big deal.", "Why is she even mad? It's not like you spent her money. NTA, you can choose when and where you want to sleep.", "NTA, she's probably not upset.\n\n\ud83d\ude0a", "NTA. You totally did the right thing. I can't imagine why Mom might be mad.", "No you're not the asshole you had an early flight then got to go to work if she got mad that's her problem not your's", "NTA. Don\u2019t fret. Don\u2019t message your mom anymore.", "NTA\n\nYou stayed overnight when there was a bed for you. You made other arrangements when there wasn't. Your mom may have had unstated expectations and is now disappointed. She's gonna feel how she's gonna feel. Taking time to process her disappointment before she responds could be appropriate for her. Feelings are normally mixed and sometimes confusing and strong. For her to process that herself, THEN communicate appropriately would be 100% okay in my book.\n\nHow she takes ownership of her expectations and disappointment when your healthy boundaries for a good night's sleep created conflict in her will tell the tale.", "NTA", ">If mom really wanted them to have time together, she could have had the sisters share so OP can have a bed.\n\nNo. If someone posted here that they were forced out of their own bedroom so a visitor could sleep there, we'd all say that was not ok. The fact is that OP's mother doesn't have enough space.", "OP's mom knows that. However, she shouldn't be mad at OP for choosing to book a hotel so she can get a good night's sleep.", "NTA. You can book a hotel. You did it respectfully. They could have put one of the sisters on the couch or you could have slept on the couch. All reasonable options.\n\nPersonally, I wouldn't expect my family to vacate their bedrooms and would just sleep on the couch. Even if if I had a bed and they showed up unexpectedly, I'd move to the couch.\n\nBut I'm also not visiting my mother and having young half siblings show up unexpectedly. Maybe there's some feelings around that. In which case, hotel is fine if the couch is weird and you were polite.", "NTA She lied. You don't have to sleep on a sofa at her demand when she went back on terms the last day. You're an adult and can see to your own comfort if she won't.", "NTA. I fail to see your mother\u2019s problem.  You did a completely reasonable thing. If she stays silent much longer, ask her.  Some people enjoy sulking and nursing their hurt feelings.  You have nothing to apologize for I can see.  So don;t.", "Nta", "Or a postcard of the hotel.", "Can you imagine sleeping on a sofa at our age, with no back support?

YTA", "NTA. You took care of yourself. Good on you", "NTA.  You will be closer to the airport and more comfortable.  She is mad because she wanted you to just suck it up so she could spend more time with you....and didn't tell you ON PURPOSE.  The AH in this scenario is her.  I would text her when you get home, reiterate your thanks and not worry about it. I am glad you had a good time.", "Don't let other people dump their emotional labour on you. Stop thinking about how your mom might feel. If she wants to tell you something, she can use her words and tell you. And there's no reason to sulk because you slept somewhere else. It's not that you balked out of quality time.\n\nNTA.", "NTA\n\nShrug. Silly thing for her to get offended over.\n\nIt's not you asked her to pay for the hotel room.", "NTA. \n\nYou need sleep. She knew you wouldn\u2019t have a bed way before 7pm.\nSeems very unfair not to mention it. But take the high road, give her a call in a few days and thank her again, ignore the sofa issue and see if you can help her move on from something which isn\u2019t that big of a deal. \nYou wanted a bed. You got a bed. Nbd.", ">If your mom is sulking.. well, let her sulk\n\nSomething tells me that OP is used to having to manage her mom's emotions.  She doesn't even know if mom is sulking or not, just anticipating it from the lack of response.", "Yep, let her sulk. Wait for her to make the first move after she's got over her tantrum, even if it takes a year. She wants OP to contact her begging for forgiveness.      \nAnd booking a hotel next to the airport is a small luxury I always do. Travel the night before, have a relaxing night, a nice meal and an early night and then get up at a reasonable time and take the free shuttle to the terminal. So much better than having to get up at four in the morning and travel through the rush hour crowd worrying about being delayed and missing my flight.", "I have spinal kyphosis from the first thoracic vertebrae to half way down to the mid lumbar. Honestly I think I\u2019d just chug monster energy at that point.\n\nMeanwhile my spouse can sleep like a baby on any surface. No idea how they do that."]}
