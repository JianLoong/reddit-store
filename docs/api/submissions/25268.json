Even if you chose the dress you were 9!\n\n11 years after they are upset for a dress that was blue but pictures may be so old that looks white in them....", "NTA, SIL and brother's logic is laughable. Don't give in to this kind of BS", "How is it that an adult woman deserves respect when she is acting hostile toward her 20 y.o. SIL because when the SIL was 9 years old she wore a blue pastel dress to her wedding which, when posted with a filter on facebook by the MIL, looks white?  \n\nWhen you told Vicky that holding a grudge against you for this was stupid, you were being positively kind as compared to what you could have said!\n\nShe takes the award for most absurd grudge that makes the grudge holder look like an A.\n\nNTA", "NTA. This *is* stupid.\n\nThe dress was blue.\nYou were nine.\nEven if you picked the dress, you couldn\u2019t have been expected to consider wedding etiquette that young.\nYour mother edited the photos\nYour mother posted the photos\n\nYou did nothing wrong", "NTA, she is upset at the wrong person.", "She was mad at you because as a child you wore a blue dress to get wedding 9 years ago ??? She deserved all you threw at her and more ! How about her disrespecting you ?? NTA ! Hope that women gets a life sometime soon", "Nope your good. Vicky is an idiot and Tim can kick rocks right along with her. Your were 9!?!? Gimmie a break", "Your sister in law is mad at you because an altered photo of you wearing a non-white dress to a wedding eleven years ago when you were nine was posted by someone not you that looks as if you were wearing a white dress?  Are there any other signs of her losing her flippin' mind?  This is the most insane reason to be pissy I have ever read.  NTA, of course, and WTF is going on with your SIL and brother?    \n\n\nAnd she did not have 'concerns'.  She sulked like a child then got upset when called out.  Then got hurt when you rightly pointed out that there is pretty much zero that you had done wrong (the closest is wearing a dress that under certain filters might appear white).    \n\n\nNTA, and is she ok?  Is there something else going on in their life?", "NTA. You were not wrong, and honestly, you don't need a person like her in your life. It doesn't even deserve an explanation, just ignore her for the rest of her days that you have to be in her presence. This is on the top of the list for absolute stupidity. You were 9, she needs to take this up with your parents. Dumb, seriously dumb.", "NTA but something else is going on in their marriage, but this (and you) are a scapegoat for their real issues. I would hold a family meeting and not let this mess fester any longer, including Tim's response about \"disrespect\". Maybe she's jealous of your looks, your level of success (i.e. like being a college graduate and she isn't, etc.). This is weird and for some reason your SIL is mad about a picture that you didn't post of something you wore when you were 9! \n\nYea, something definitely is not right in their marriage.", "NTA \n\nYou didn\u2019t post the picture or apply the filter so why be mad at you? You can\u2019t control what other adults do on social media platforms that you don\u2019t have. In NO WAY does this make sense. You\u2019re 100% right, if she has such a problem with it she needs to address it with your mom who made the edit and posted it. Hell, did you even know your picture was being taken at the time? It sounds like you had absolutely NOTHING to do with this at all. \n\nAnd also, \u201cYou must have had some choice in what to wear.\u201d LOL. No. Kids at formal events get handed outfits they hate and are forced to wear them or else get severely punished (at least how that worked in my family). You might maybe get to pick what undies you\u2019re wearing but that\u2019s about it at age 9. And also guess what?!? THE DRESS WAS BLUE! Even if you did hand pick it out of hundreds of dresses it wouldn\u2019t have violated any rules about not wearing white to a wedding. Your MOTHER applied the color edit filter. Unless this is some magic filter developed by the CIA that goes back in time and actually changes the color of things during the events that happened she\u2019s got LITERALLY NOTHING to be upset about. \n\nI\u2019d seriously consider having her go in for a psychiatric evaluation if she\u2019s actually mad about this and it isn\u2019t just something she thought of to not bring up the real issue (and refusing to address an issue that\u2019s clearly bothering you is also something that she needs to see a therapist about). She sounds like she doesn\u2019t live in this reality and is just such a nightmare to deal with that your brother just goes along with whatever crazy thing she happens to believe in at the time. Keep yourself/children/animals away from her because she sounds pretty damn unhinged. Good luck OP!", "Vicky sounds oh so icky. Just the thought of being \u2018round her makes me oh so sicky. \n\nFairly Odd Parents references aside, she sounds kinda sucky if she\u2019s holding a grudge from when you were nine years old. \n\nNTA", "NTA Your brother's wife needs to get a grip. Because who the hell gets pissed off at a 9 year old for what she wore to a wedding? Did she really think that at 9 years old you went out and bought your own dress for this wedding? \n\nYour brother sounds like an idiot too. And there's no way in hell if I were you that I would apologize to anybody. As a matter of fact, i'd actually tell your mom what happened and what's been going on and let her handle it.", "OP was 9 years old when wedding happened.     \nOP was *not* the one who edited and posted the photos.       \nOP, your SIL is officially nucking futs.       \n**NTA**", "NTA! You were 9 years old FFS! That was 11 years ago!", "OP you have to tell your mom in front of your entire family and embarrass this idiot even more. Mention how hilarious you think it is and boy mom you really screwed that one up", "NTA. OP\u2019s brother is the biggest AH for putting up with his wife\u2019s nonsense. \n\nI\u2019d avoid the pair of them as much as possible.", "Vicky is an imbecile.", "I can\u2019t read these anymore. They\u2019re ridiculous.", "You were correct for calling her actions out for something that truly happened 11 years ago. Also, you mom did the editing not you. She is acting as a child so you said how you feel. \n\nIt seems like there is more to the story that you do t know about and I\u2019m sure the photo has nothing to do with you. Talk with your mom and maybe get some answers.\n\nAs far as your brother is concerned, if he didn\u2019t like the answers then he shouldn\u2019t have talked about it with you. As a grown man he should see all aspects of the situation. Sometimes it means telling ur SO they are wrong.", "NTA you were 9 years old. The event was 11 years ago. This SIL has a sad life if she gets upset over petty things.", "Lol NTA, YOU WERE 9!!  SIL is unhinged", "NTA this is insane. What other things is she mad about??", "I had little to no say in my wardrobe at the age of 9. And I honestly didn't learn that it's a faux pas to wear white to someone else's wedding until after I was married!!\n\nBlaming OP for something that happened when they were 9, and for something that OPs mom did, not OP herself, Is batsh*t crazy.", "NTA.  Ffs your SIL is being ridiculous.  What is wrong with her and your brother?  It was 11 years ago and you were 9!!  I had no choice what to wear to a wedding when I was 9.", "NTAH, Vicky is bat shit crazy", "is this for real? do people really behave this way?\n\nyour sil is unhinged in the truest sense of the word. and your brother's not much better for defending her insane behaviour.\n\nyou are NTA.", "You are absolutely right.  This 33year old woman has got a problem.  What did she want you to do?   Apologize for, at the age of nine, wearing a dress of a color that could be made to look white eleven years later?  Apologize for your mother using a filter?  Stupid is a good word.", "I was sure you were NTA when I read that it was your mom who edited the photos so that the dress appeared to be white. This had nothing to do with you. And you didn't even know about any of this, SIL just held a grudge against you without explanation.\n\nThen you mentioned that you were nine years old. SIL needs to GTFO with her nonsense - and your brother can follow suit with his \"You disrespected my wife\" BS.", "I'm sorry she is made at something you wore when you were 9?  She was in the picture, she knew what you wore why is she upset now? She is being very petty and Tim needs to grow up.  I think you were very mature about it.", "Your brother is spineless. You\u2019re NTA", "When I got married my little flower girl wore a white dress... Could not care less! She was the most disgustingly cute LG, full of sass and 2yr tantrums \ud83d\ude02\n\nI can imagine having an issue with a CHILD for wearing a light coloured dress and her parent editing the photo to make it look different. That's an issue with her and the parent, and like the coward she is she's blaming the child in this situation and like the idiot the brother is he's not looking at it and setting his wife straight.\n\nYou are definitely NTA and I suggest maybe it's time to also not waste your time with them as well.", "As if a parent is letting their nine year old pick their clothes to anything fancy, let alone a wedding.

Sorry this is so trivial in the world that it infuriates me. She wants to be pissed? How about being pissed at Big Pharma who push drugs on cancer patients with stage 1 cancer that during treatment a percentage will have massive heart attacks that will kill them? That's why my sister died last Friday.  Please tell her to put on her big girl pants and get a frigging life.", "Nta. Your SIL needs to grow up. You were a child. Odds are, your mother might have given you options, but she would have had to make the selection for you. She also would have had veto powers.\n\nYour mother is also the one who edited the photographs.\n\nIf she gets that upset over something so trivial...tell your brother you'll make sure to wear black to his next wedding.", "NTA Get a FB account. Copy pictures, show actual shade of unfiltered dress as well as you can recall, and call her out. Enough of this crap. She's 33? Seriously?", "Wtf?  NTA you were 9. Your SIL sounds deranged", "NTA. You were 9, she is stupid.", "In what world is a 9 year old going to be mistaken for a bride?

At that stage I'd be tempted to literally point and laugh out loud every time I saw her. NTA, obviously. Is she afraid FB viewers will think the 9 year-old sister was the bride???", "NTA at all.  Vicky needs to grow TF up, and your brother needs to grow a pair.\n\nAlmost 30 years ago, I attended a wedding in my early 20s as a guest.

Their photographer was evidently awful, because when the photo came back (the couple gave one to each of the college buddies), \\*I\\* was in the middle of the picture!

Unhinged brides and their obsession with wedding etiquette..", "Vicky is ridiculous. And her husband supporting such ridiculous is shameful.", "NTA. This has nothing to do with you and your brother and his wife are being absolutely ridiculous. You were 9 and you wore blue, not white or near white. As a 9 year old, I doubt you were buying your own clothes, or all caught up on wedding etiquette, OR in some long term plan with you mother to wait 12 years and then insult your SIL, using a platform you're not on. \n\nYour SIL is being terribly immature and manipulative by punishong you for your mother's actions, and not just asking your mother to remove the picture. If she's tagged in it, she can remove the tag. But you can't do anything at all about her feelings, including getting in a time machine to ask for a different color dress.
