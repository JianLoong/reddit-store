I asked who and she said it\u2019s a family friend who is a \u201cterrible planner and didn\u2019t book anyone to do her makeup and is now panicking.\u201d This friend is in her late 20s/early 30s. I don\u2019t know because I\u2019ve never met this person. \n\nNow, I am no makeup artist. My friend asked me because I used to do her makeup for homecoming and prom in high school. That\u2019s it. I never took classes or tried to become a professional makeup artist. Fast forward 5 years and I\u2019m probably worse at makeup than I was in high school because that\u2019s when I used to watch a bunch of YouTube and waste all of my little money at Sephora. I\u2019ve never done anyone else\u2019s makeup for a special occasion other than my best friends, and definitely not wedding makeup. \n\nSo, I responded to my friend, telling her that I don\u2019t think I would feel comfortable doing wedding makeup for a bride (AND her bridesmaids!!!). I mentioned that I hadn\u2019t done anyone\u2019s makeup in a while and wouldn\u2019t want to ruin someone\u2019s wedding day with horrible makeup. My friend responded trying to convince me that I would do a good job and that this person really needs someone to help her. I told her again that I wouldn\u2019t feel comfortable doing it and that hopefully the bride figures something out. All she responded was \u201cokay.\u201d \n\nWe haven\u2019t really talked/texted much over the last couple weeks which is normal for us. But over the weekend, she texted and said the wedding was that afternoon and the bride still hadn\u2019t found anyone and that she (my friend) told the bride about me. I replied that I still did not want to do it and she didn\u2019t respond. The next day she texted me that the bride\u2019s sister did the makeup and that it didn\u2019t go well. She told me the bride cried and that it would have gone a lot better if I had been there. \n \nI feel like my friend is trying to make me feel bad about this situation.

That\u2019s not a friend and she\u2019s a weirdo. NTA", "NTA - you dodged a bullet. If you went and the bride wasnt happy, you would be the one on the receiving end of an upset bride.

Why can't they just do their makeup as they normally do when going out.", "NTA. You had every right to decline and your friend should have taken your no the first time.\n\nAlso, where was all the makeup going to come from?

Your friend on the other hand, major AH.", "nta \n\nthe bride would likely have been crying over the makeup you did on her, and everyone would be directly blaming you instead of the sister. \n\nyour friend should not have told the bride about you. the moment you said you felt uncomfortable she should have left it alone. it is the bride's fault for the lack of proper planning.", "NTA.

You are not a make up artist. Also nowhere in your post does it mention you being offered pay for this service.", "NTA. She's not a best friend for imposing on you.", "NTA. You are absolutely right to not do this. You don't feel comfortable. It isn't your profession. You haven't kept on the trends, so you are correct. Bride's poor planning isn't your problem.", "NTA and kudos to you for not just going for a. quick cash grab.", "NTA- the bride should of been way more prepared and booked a makeup artist. Better to not go then going and the bride maybe not liking the makeup and being pissed and you feeling uncomfortable.", "NTA\n\nI don\u2019t see how the bride not booking a make up artist ahead of time is your problem and why your friend is making such a weird, passive-aggressive deal about this. Can you imagine if you did go, got paid, and the bride didn\u2019t get what she expected? She would have been pissed at you.\n\nYou made the right call by saying no and your friend should have respected that. Also, what\u2019s with all these women who can\u2019t do their own damn makeup?", "Of course you\u2019re NTA. You\u2019re not responsible for rescuing people from problems they created themselves. I guarantee your friend told the bride she would handle it. The bride didn\u2019t bother to nail it down.  This is not yours to fix.", "Not your circus. Not your monkeys. Not your problem. NTA", "NTA. She didn\u2019t forget; women don\u2019t \u201cforget\u201d to get a makeup artist or stylist for their wedding day. Your friend told her she knew someone who could do her entire party\u2019s makeup for free and you declined. Then as the day got closer she was forced to tell them you couldn\u2019t and is now trying to guilt you for her mistake.", "NTA! She is gaslighting you. Find new friends immediately! \nWhat are the 4 types of gaslighting?\n\nThere are four primary types of gaslighting behaviors: the\u00a0straight-up lie, reality manipulation, scapegoating and coercion.", "NTA- she asked you and said no.  That should have been the end of it. Then she tried guilting you into doing their makeup, you again declined. Now she is trying to make you feel bad for someone else's poor planning.\n\n Are you sure this is a friend?? Let alone you best friend.", "NTA - Frankly, it\u2019s weird your friend is fixated on this. Her friend needed a makeup artist, she thought of you, turns out you\u2019re not a good match\u2026 should have been the end of it.", "NTA. No is a full sentence and your friend should have respected that. She\u2019s trying to make you feel guilty by not helping. The brides poor planning does not constitute an emergency on your part.", "NTA. But your friend's desperation over the whole situation feels like she was given $$$ to handle the makeup aspect or she volunteered as a gift, sure that she could corner you into doing it for free.\n\nWhy do you care an unknown bride is crying about her ruined makeup and all the bride had to do was book someone?", "There are people who do this shit for a living. FFS they could have avoided all this drama and bullshit, but then they would have had to pay market prices. Please, do NOT feel guilty. I\u2019m absolutely positive they would have paid you bargain basement prices for your hard work and then complained afterward, or even stiffed you. NTA", "Ok, and how do you think it would turn out if you didn't do a stellar job? Why did your friend told the bride about you after you said no?\nNTA, and I'm not sure how much of a friend that is", "NTA. I think she didn't want to pay anyone to do her makeup.", "NTA - Your friend is used to being able to low-key control you and doesn't like you asserting yourself. Most people are fairly capable of doing their own makeup by themselves and it's better than having an amateur mess up. I bet they weren't even prepared with all the makeup you would need. Because you don't just have a kit laying around. Don't worry about it. I bet she's exaggerating the brides response to make you feel bad.", "A few weeks is enough time for the bride to have booked professional services. She just didn't want to pay.", "NTA\n\nThe bride failed to book someone to do her make up for her wedding. That\u2019s on her. You already told your friend, no. Her coming back to you for a second time was just rude.", "NTA, you told her the truth and she didn't want to hear the \"NO\"", "I\u2019m positive this friend promised the bride that you would do it and when she didn\u2019t come through, she\u2019s trying to push the blame onto you. Doesn\u2019t sound like much of a friend here", "Thank you for your response. I think the fact that it would have been a \u201cnice thing to do\u201d is what made me feel like I maybe was the AH. I mentally went back and forth about being a \u201cgood person.\u201d But I think it would have created more problems for the bride and me (emotionally) had I agreed to do it. I need to stand firm in the boundaries I set in place.", "This right here!  The bride obviously didn't want to pay for it and was looking for someone to blame.", "Even with it being so late in the game - they can find somebody who has actual experience doing people's makeup *if* they were willing to pay an appropriate amount for wedding makeup. The post says they're willing to pay, but I imagine they thought they could pay a fraction of what they should pay if they hired an inexperienced 22yo.", "It's in the third sentence, it ends with \"and that they would pay me.\" But yeah, definitely would have passed in OP's shoes and definitely NTA.", "Nta no bride Is that bad of a planner and they could have chosen a few salons to go to or looked online."]}
