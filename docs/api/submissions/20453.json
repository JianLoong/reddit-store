I said no problem I'll take care of that let's just make sure we have a clear list so I'm not buying things you don't want.

She said I wasn't doing my part and that I just found a way to work around it. My perspective was that I took the burden from her which is what she said the problem was. I did it the way that works for me because I was the one doing it.

He doesn\u2019t get to decide how you spend your time or your money. He is more than free to hire cleaning help for himself if he would like also. He seems to have some sort of a moral qualm with people not doing their own cleaning. But I bet you he takes his car to a mechanic and buys meat at the grocery store instead of hunting and processing it himself. NTA.\n\nEdit: I can\u2019t get over this. You hired help because you\u2019re exhausted because you\u2019re working 12 to 14 hour days right now, so he thinks that you need to help him do his chores? \ud83d\ude33 Did he miss the part where you hired this help because you\u2019re exhausted from your job? I have a better idea: how about he hires some cleaning help and then comes and helps you with your business. \ud83d\ude44", "NTA \u2b06\ufe0f this right here OP. I\u2019ll add that if hubby wants help with his chores then either he pays the housekeeper additional money out of his personal account or you both start paying her/him to clean the entire house out of the joint account.\n\nEither way, tell the big whiney baby to go tattle to his mommy because you aren\u2019t his mother and are to busy to deal with his bs. (Sorry if this offends anyone. My own relationship with my husband is one that when I tell him this, and it is a pre-agreed upon reality check BTW, it lets him know he\u2019s being immature and he stops and walks away to think. When he comes back an hour later we talk it out and work it out like adults and the we laugh about it after. We\u2019re a weird couple. LOL)", "Award given-dead on right!!", "agree", "this.", "The husband\u2019s whole point in this argument is to make OP look lazy and feel guilty about making more than him.", "exactly", "Having been married twice, I can indeed confirm the existence of whiny 51-y-o losers", "That was what struck me here: the sheer pettiness. It gets done, who cares? What a baby he is. \ud83d\ude02", "This is what struck me too. Boohoo, you're not personally doing your cleaning, so it's not fair! \n\nWhat a petty whiny person. And at 51 years old? I'd expect that from a 16 year old.\n\nMassive NTA.", "you are right.", "I read that in Forrest Gump's voice TBH", "And now I can only read it in that voice. \ud83d\ude06", "Husband is really smart. He used the weakest manipulation in the world and OP is here debating with strangers. The dumb one is OP", "He doesn't actually think it's fair, he's just testing a boundary to see if he'll get away with it. Saying something isn't fair is just the easiest and most basic tactic", "Totally agree. This may go quite a bit deeper than how to divide chores. TBH, I can\u2019t help wondering what happens should one of you become ill and unable even to work or do chores. Or if another kind of crisis should disrupt things. Because his reaction to this is irrational, if not bizarre. It sounds to me like he\u2019s got some kind of issue with you paying for instead of doing your chores, even though he could easily do the same if he doesn\u2019t want to do chores. I have to wonder, does he, in his heart of hearts, think it\u2019s really YOUR job to take care of chores?\n\nGood luck, but if he keeps pushing you on this, I\u2019d suggest some couple\u2019s counseling to get at the underlying issue.", "Agreed this seems to be about control. When partners have issues with chores it\u2019s usually because they are needing to do more / pick up the others slack but your paying someone to do your half so it isn\u2019t like he\u2019s needing to do more since you aren\u2019t doing work. Seems to be jealous / insecure about your job or worse have the idea that chores are women\u2019s tasks.", "Good luck. I hope you get away safely.", "All the best. I really hope you leave safely", "I usually do the cleaning then because o hate not doing something lol", "> I dont understand how he can argue that this is controlling him.\n\nHe's a manipulative asshole, that's how.", "It can leave very little time to unwind.", "Maybe 1,5-2 times what he makes", "I get what you are saying about assigned chores, but in general, that only works if both people are invested in the cleaning/upkeep and to the same standards. For example, I had a roommate years ago in college who would fill her trashcan, pile it up on top, and then instead of taking it out, get another garbage bag to sit beside the trash can, fill it up (which would often topple over because it didn't have a can to sit in,) and then once she had three or four full bags of trash, she would take them out. She said she couldn't be bothered to make the 50ft walk to the maintenance room more than twice a month. However, I kept my trashcan neat because I grew up in the country where we would get mice and ants. I wouldn't even throw food away in it but would take the wrappers/cans to the big maintenance cans. \n\nAll that to say, assigned chores can be useful in a situation where one partner isn't as keen to clean or do upkeep, because it keeps the other person from doing those chores out of frustration. \n\nAs for OP, in my opinion the simplest solution would be -- if they can afford it, and it seems they can -- to have a housekeeper come around who is paid out of the joint expenses. Then, both OP and hubby have the extra time and less stress.", "Dear Lord, 51 is not decrepit. I promise you most 50-year-olds are perfectly able-bodied and enjoy full lives, including cleaning up the kitchen.", "Not a very large age gap. 50-year-olds are still youngish and able-bodied if in decent health.\nETA 53F.", "Dude, 50yos aren't exactly hobbling around on walkers. Plus that age gap is fine assuming she was mid to late 20s or older when they got together.", "Lol. My husband is 62. He ran 12 miles yesterday and that\u2019s not his long run for the week. He did his first tri at 50. He just walked the dog and is on his way to the store to do the grocery shopping. He cooks and does the gardening. And his own laundry and when we didn\u2019t have a housecleaner we both cleaned the house every Thursday night. Not sure what kind of unhealthy examples of middle age you have been shown.", "bruh my father is 65 and still does construction, he's more physically able than i am at 28", ">I\u2019m of the mind that if a marital problem can be fixed with money, just fix it with money.\n\nUsually this would mean fixing it with joint money, not out of just one partner's pocket.  If they both want a cleaner to do both people's chores, they would both pay for that.", "Its the energy and emotional drain of working the long hours leading to  having little energy to clean.  Add in cooking, may have errands, eating, prepping for next day and sleep.  It can leave very little time to unwind.  If you are on your feet most of the work day, it freaking hurts to be on them any longer.", "I know, we like it very clean and we have a 500 Square meters home. we have a gardner a few times a year and a robot mower so the  chores are only inside the house", "Unloading the dishwasher, loading it back up, cleaning down the counters and sink, and taking out the trash takes me about 20 minutes. That's just one chore. Everyone operates at a different speed, so you're either ignoring that or vastly underestimating the amount of housework needed to actually keep a home clean.", "Cleaning bathrooms, cleaning kitchen, vacuuming whole house, windows, mirrors, dusting, laundry, cooking, grocery shopping, meal planning, mopping/steam cleaning/sweeping, dishes, trash, etc. A few of those take 10 minutes I guess. But most of them take longer, and all of them need to be done regularly.", "Agreed. Besides hygiene things like dishes and laundry? But even laundry can go a while. Get a roomba? Like people really over complicate chores. Especially when kids aren\u2019t involved letting the house get a bit dusty or a toilet not being scrubbed isn\u2019t a huge deal.", "she is doing her part. by paying for it. thats how goods and services work.", "She\u2019s quite literally paying for it out of *her own* money, so he\u2019s it does.
