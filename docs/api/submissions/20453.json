We both work. I\u2019m a business owner so my work schedule depends on my workloa. Some periods I work 7 days a week. Some periods 2. My husband has a 9-5 job.

Y\u2019all talked about it. You\u2019re choosing to spend some of your money that y\u2019all agree to keep separate to free up more of your time. Time = Money.

If you start doing his chores you\u2019re spending your money AND time.", "NTA He don't want to pay, he doesn't have to but the audacity that he thinks it's unfair that YOU personally don't clean is bordering on the whiny loser and he's 51!!???", "NTA. If he wanted help with his part, he could have agreed with getting the cleaner for all of the chores. Plus, in a way, you are doing the chores yourself. Time = money. The time you would have spend cleaning, you are using to work and with the money that you generate from working you can pay the cleaner.", "NTA you are busy with heavy workload.  You came up with a viable option of hiring help.  He doesn\u2019t want to pay but still wants the benefits of hired help without paying.  He can either contribute to paying or continue to do his chores.", "NTA your husband is not a smart man if he honestly believes his suggestion is fair.", "Definitely NTA. \n\nHe can't have it both ways. Tell him, if he is ready to hire someone or pitch in for hired help, he is welcome to. But since you are getting your chores done by proxy, you are not liable to share his. Stand firm.", "If he wants the benefits of you paying for the chores then he can damn well agree to them being paid from the joint expenses account.\n\nYou are literally paying to not have to deal with that stuff. \n\nNTA", "NTA. He can hire help with his money too.", "NTA. If he\u2019s too cheap to pay for help, that\u2019s his problem. This obsession with everything being divided evenly doesn\u2019t work if your work situations and availability of free time are unequal.", "NTA. You talked about it, you are going through a busy period and he knew this was coming.", "NTA, he's honestly being a bad partner & is intimidated by the idea that you make more money.  The fact that he's refusing to temporarily help you with even the most menial tasks in the times when you need it says a lot about this guy.  This isn't actually about chores or hiring a cleaning person.", "NTA. You can't clean right now and found a solution.", "NTA\n\nYour husband is being weirdly petty. \n\nWhat does it matter, as long as the cleaning gets done.", "NTA.\n\nYou are very busy so it's okay if you need to hire extra help.", "NTA he should also hire help if he doesn't want to do his half", "So he wants you to pay for your chores and do his?

It's not fair to say that you have to pay yourself because he is being stubborn.", "NTA he said he was fine cleaning, and now he is throwing a hissy fit cause you're paying for your half to be cleaned. It doesn't work both ways. Either he pays for his chores to be completed as well, or he does them!", "Ugh, my husband acted like this when I first got sick (EDS). I literally couldn't walk when it first got bad, let alone clean all day. I begged for a cleaner, he hemmed and hawed and argued until he finally agreed, but insisted that I pay for it myself.\n\nHere we are 4 years later, and I'm still sick (always will be!), still paying for a cleaner out of my business account, and he's become an abusive jerk who I'm currently making plans to leave.\n\nNta, get the cleaner and only tell them to do your chores. He can still do his if he's not contributing to the cleaner's pay.", "NTA I guess, he won't pay for you to get help but he then demands you do some of his chores. But none of this sounds like a healthy marriage tbh", "What kind of chores do people have that can't be done in like 10 a day or 30 minutes on the weekend?? Like outside of mowing the grass, what takes so long??", "NTA. Your husband is being unreasonable. Depending on your finances tho, I would personally just offer to pay the cleaner to do his part of the cleaning too. You definitely do not have to, but I\u2019m of the mind that if a marital problem can be fixed with money, just fix it with money.", "ESH.
