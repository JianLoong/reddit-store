I said no problem I'll take care of that let's just make sure we have a clear list so I'm not buying things you don't want. We work together put a list together and then because it's my preference I said everything up online at safeway.

She said I wasn't doing my part and that I just found a way to work around it. My perspective was that I took the burden from her which is what she said the problem was. I did it the way that works for me because I was the one doing it.

If you spend your own money to get a dishwasher and cut your dish-washing time down to 1 hour a week, do you now owe 4 hours of labor per week to make up for it? If he's responsible for mowing the lawn and uses a riding mower because it saves 3 hours versus using a push mower, should he do 3 more hours of work instead of switching to a push mower?

She said she couldn't be bothered to make the 50ft walk to the maintenance room more than twice a month. However, I kept my trashcan neat because I grew up in the country where we would get mice and ants. I wouldn't even throw food away in it but would take the wrappers/cans to the big maintenance cans. \n\nAll that to say, assigned chores can be useful in a situation where one partner isn't as keen to clean or do upkeep, because it keeps the other person from doing those chores out of frustration. \n\nAs for OP, in my opinion the simplest solution would be -- if they can afford it, and it seems they can -- to have a housekeeper come around who is paid out of the joint expenses.
