It\u2019s a bit distasteful to celebrate your sobriety with an alcohol toast, and obviously a bit of a downer at a family gathering. However, seems like it came from a sincere place. Be grateful they\u2019re still in your life and talk it out with your therapist/sponsor, maybe? This internet stranger is proud of you!", "Mild YTA.\n\nIt's easy to get focused on the substance of addiction, but beneath the using of the substance itself the experience for your loved ones was that of seeing you repeatedly place your feelings above all else. You see conflict between recovered addicts and their loved ones because while the addict isn't using anymore, they are still insisting that their feelings must come before all else, they want everything else to pretend it all never happened.\n\nThe only way out of shame is to go through it. You earned the shame, now you have to earn your way out, to own it and overcome it. One day you'll be able to stand up at Thanksgiving yourself and make a similar speech to your brother's, fully acknowledging the hurt you caused but also that you've become a better person and are grateful for their continued love and support, without feeling any shame. That's the day when you know you've truly given your all to recovery and rebuilding.", "For Americans: Canadian Thanksgiving\n\nFor the post...  I can conceive if it being said in a well meaning way, but it's not my first instinct.   I also see exactly how it would make you feel bad.   Without being there I can't give a definitive answer, but it sounds like it sucked.   Sorry you dealt with that.", "NAH stay strong mate. A year clean is no mean feat", "YTA- Buck up, Buttercup. Your sobriety for however long does not cancel out everything your loved ones had to deal with. At a minimum, you should have the grace to accept that it might come up in conversation, especially when it's a family member grateful that you're alive. That embarrassing feeling you have is part of the tapestry of emotions that'll keep you from using opioids again. Be thankful.", "YTA\n\nIt\u02bbs family Thanksgiving. Everyone there knows about you. It\u02bbs not some big secret he outed. I\u02bbm guessing that they\u02bbve probably been harmed by you. I\u02bbm guessing that you\u02bbve lied to them, used them, possibly stolen from them. If you did any of that, now that\u02bbs the stuff that you should really be embarrassed by.\n\nSo he expressed a statement that hopefully your whole family shares. And be glad they do. Because plenty of families of addicts reach a point where they no longer care. Sober or not, they want nothing more to do with the person who\u02bbs done so much damage to them.\n\nInstead your family still embraces and supports you and is thankful for you.", "NTA....there is a time and place for that. He knows you weren't going to like it and did it anyway. That should have been done on private with just the 2 of you.", "YTA\n\nThat shit still happened. Maybe you were euphoric and amnesiatic  through a lot of it, but you family had to suffer through it. \n\nYou can\u2019t just decide you\u2019re done with the past and nobody should bring it up, ever. Live it down.", "NTA.\n\nIf Will was sincere, which you suggest he was, this wasn\u2019t his experience to share. It\u2019s true that he\u2019s happy you\u2019re there, but it doesn\u2019t have to be said in this way. \u201cI\u2019m so thankful that my brother is here today\u201d says the same thing that he said, without the details and without bringing the room down.\n\nHaving said that, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s egregious. He could have thought that expressing his thankfulness and love could have been beneficial for you. I think it would have been helpful to stick around to let him know you\u2019d prefer him not to share this stuff, and hear his reasoning behind it.", "NTA to not want your own private life brought up like that in front of a group. While it was probably coming from a good place on his part, you have the right to not want him to bring it up and to leave. He should accept that despite his good intentions it is not something you wanted or liked that he did.", "Ooft this is a tough one. I\u2019m leaning towards NTA, not because of your brothers initial toast (although it was overstepping and inconsiderate, the sincerity salvages it a little) but for calling you a dick and refusing to apologise after you communicated your boundaries. Regardless of his initial intentions with the speech, you\u2019re well within your rights to ask that information to be kept private, and he\u2019s being an asshole by not accepting that.", "NTA\n\nYour tipsy brother toasted your sobriety. The irony would be hilarious if it wasn\u2019t so heartbreaking.", "Nta. You were trying to enjoy your family holiday meal. You didn\u2019t want to be reminded of a time that was difficult. It wasn\u2019t the place or time for your brother to bring it up. Good for you for setting boundaries. And congrats on your one year sobriety!", "I don't blame you for being upset. I don't talk to my brother. Don't blame you one bit.", "NTA your brother's toast was extremely insensitive.", "NTA\n\nSorry Will, say it privately not publicly. Does he want you to relapse or what? It sounds like he could have driven you to the point of taking that next first drink, or score. F Will!", "NTA - Your brother was aware of your situation and should have been sensitive to your feelings when you were celebrating a year of sobriety. He was likely well intentioned, but didn't read the room.  \nNTA but your brother may not understand the effects his words had on you. Try not to punish him too harshly. Talk to him and let him know that his speech was difficult to hear and how it affected you in the moment. Good luck on your journey!", "NTA - Congratulations for such a huge accomplishment! Your brother is the AH any way you look at this:\n\n1.\t\u2060Who toasts another person\u2019s sobriety with alcohol?\n2.\t\u2060If he was really trying to celebrate you, he would have congratulated you of you sobriety instead of saying that he\u2019s thankful you\u2019re \u201cstill alive and sober\u201d given all the bad things you\u2019ve done. This was an insult presented as a compliment.\n3.\t\u2060Why wouldn\u2019t he apologize for hurting your feelings as soon as he learned that he embarrassed you?", "YTA\n\nYou need to grow some thicker skin.\n\nThis is your history. Own it. Be proud of accomplishing something nearly impossible, kicking an opiode addiction, and being sober for a year.\n\nI suspect your brother's toast was heartfelt. I wouldn't be surprised if he and other members of your family genuinely feared for your life. They likely had many moments when they thought you were completely lost to them.\n\nHe is genuinely thankful that you are still with them and have your shit together.\n\nIt's time you learned that it's not your fuck ups the define you. It's how you deal with them.\n\n---\n\nI am the brother and brother-in-law of addicts. I still love my sibling and am genuinely proud that she is finally 2 years sober. And yes, I feared. Their spouse is one of my favorite people in the world, whom I love to death, and have told him as such.\n\nFor your own sake, don't shy away from your history. What you have accomplished is absolutely amazing and very few can actually do it. Be proud instead of embarrassed and focus on your lessons learned and the road ahead.", "NTA. You're trying to get back to a normal life and he didn't allow that to happen", "I have been in your shoes, and it's awkward AF to be the subject of a toast like that. My first Thanksgiving after getting sober, a family member poured himself a glass of wine, then looked at me like I was a vampire who was about to pounce on him. Family members really don't understand how to interact when someone gets sober, but (at least to me) it comes from a place of love and concern. In genuine efforts to be supportive or respectful, they often end up making the situation even more awkward. \n\nThat said, you should not expect any of them to understand how the toast made you feel unless they have lived your life. Even if you say, \"I really don't like it when you praise me for my sobriety.\" When I initially said that to my family, they were like, \"Why not? You've done an amazing thing! You should be proud.\"\nYes, you should be proud, but that doesn't mean anything about this situation is comfortable or easy. \n\nINFO: Is this the first full-family gathering since you got sober? Has it ever been brought up in a group setting like this before? Have you previously told anyone in your family whether or not you're comfortable discussing your sobriety or your addiction? \n\nI kind of feel like NAH, but your brother would have been much more supportive if he had discussed this toast with you BEFORE he did it to get your consent. He meant well but should not have mentioned your situation specifically. \n\nYou are well within your rights to feel the way you feel and to react the way you did. \n\nSo sorry that happened but congrats!", "NTA. he knows your wouldn't like it toasted like that, and it was distasteful to do it while drunk.", "As a recovering addict I would be MORTIFIED and very pissed off if anyone in my family toasted my sobriety with an alcoholic drink. I do not care how well meaning and sincere they were. That\u2019s like spitting in your face (no matter your drug of choice) \n\nNot only that, I can\u2019t imagine how triggering that might have been for you. I know we are responsible for our own triggers but you don\u2019t \u201ccheers\u201d someone\u2019s sobriety with alcohol. Whole heartedly and emphatically NTA. \n\nCongratulations on your sobriety. I\u2019m very proud of you.\n\nETA: have you introduced your family to Al-Anon? It\u2019s very helpful for family members who\u2019ve had to deal with loved ones who were/are addicts. It may be beneficial in your case as well.", "NAH you are allowed to be embarrassed at that toast and to leave early to collect yourself. Your family had to deal with the trauma of years of jail, rehab and addiction and they\u2019re allowed to be thankful that you\u2019re alive and sober and express that at the family thanksgiving.", "It's called consequences.   Do you think those invited didn't know of your drug habit?   Didn't worry together?   Seek support amongst each other?  \n\nYou felt embarrassed and angry.   Feel those things all you want but accept that you probably should feel embarrassed but it's selfish and immature to feel angry.  How about your family who were worried for your actual life for how many years? How does that even come close to your upset tantrum?   The fact you now won't talk to your brother so your silence manipulates him into sucking up to you to make you feel better?\n\nHaving a close family member so grateful you're still around is a gift.  A damn gift.  You're clean and sober and have a loving family to share life with.... bloody well appreciate it.", "I have a brother who used to be a drug addict and recently stop with alcoholism, maybe he\u2019s saying it as sincere? I probably would have done the same since that is #1 of being grateful is to have my brother back.", "I don\u2019t think YTA, but he isn\u2019t either. My brother was an addict for quite a few years. He finally got clean and has been so for just over 10 years. My family even had a dinner celebrating it. Every year I go out of my way to acknowledge how proud I am of him and of how far he has come. I do it privately though, I don\u2019t think his business is anybody else\u2019s business. That being said, I\u2019m sure your behavior affected everyone in your family. Instead of trying to pretend (like my mom does with my brother) that nothing was ever wrong, he is trying to celebrate your achievements and (in his mind at least) praise you for how well you have done the past year. I\u2019d go have a talk with I\u2019m and tell him how it made you feel. He won\u2019t do it again. You said your self he probably did it out of love. Go have a cup of coffee, clear it up and move on.", "He was trying to compliment you and you got all up in your feelings. Sober people have trouble relaxing without drugs and sounds like you proved his point about how difficult you can be. Relax.", "You celebrate Thanksgiving in...October?
