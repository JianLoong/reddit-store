It\u2019s a bit distasteful to celebrate your sobriety with an alcohol toast, and obviously a bit of a downer at a family gathering. However, seems like it came from a sincere place. Be grateful they\u2019re still in your life and talk it out with your therapist/sponsor, maybe? This internet stranger is proud of you!", "Mild YTA.\n\nIt's easy to get focused on the substance of addiction, but beneath the using of the substance itself the experience for your loved ones was that of seeing you repeatedly place your feelings above all else. You see conflict between recovered addicts and their loved ones because while the addict isn't using anymore, they are still insisting that their feelings must come before all else, they want everything else to pretend it all never happened.\n\nThe only way out of shame is to go through it. You earned the shame, now you have to earn your way out, to own it and overcome it. One day you'll be able to stand up at Thanksgiving yourself and make a similar speech to your brother's, fully acknowledging the hurt you caused but also that you've become a better person and are grateful for their continued love and support, without feeling any shame. That's the day when you know you've truly given your all to recovery and rebuilding.", "For Americans: Canadian Thanksgiving\n\nFor the post...  I can conceive if it being said in a well meaning way, but it's not my first instinct.   I also see exactly how it would make you feel bad.   Without being there I can't give a definitive answer, but it sounds like it sucked.   Sorry you dealt with that.", "NAH stay strong mate. A year clean is no mean feat", "YTA- Buck up, Buttercup. Your sobriety for however long does not cancel out everything your loved ones had to deal with. At a minimum, you should have the grace to accept that it might come up in conversation, especially when it's a family member grateful that you're alive. That embarrassing feeling you have is part of the tapestry of emotions that'll keep you from using opioids again. Be thankful.", "YTA\n\nIt\u02bbs family Thanksgiving. Everyone there knows about you. It\u02bbs not some big secret he outed. I\u02bbm guessing that they\u02bbve probably been harmed by you. I\u02bbm guessing that you\u02bbve lied to them, used them, possibly stolen from them. If you did any of that, now that\u02bbs the stuff that you should really be embarrassed by.\n\nSo he expressed a statement that hopefully your whole family shares. And be glad they do. Because plenty of families of addicts reach a point where they no longer care. Sober or not, they want nothing more to do with the person who\u02bbs done so much damage to them.\n\nInstead your family still embraces and supports you and is thankful for you.", "NTA....there is a time and place for that. He knows you weren't going to like it and did it anyway. That should have been done on private with just the 2 of you.", "YTA\n\nThat shit still happened. Maybe you were euphoric and amnesiatic  through a lot of it, but you family had to suffer through it. \n\nYou can\u2019t just decide you\u2019re done with the past and nobody should bring it up, ever. Live it down.", "NTA.\n\nIf Will was sincere, which you suggest he was, this wasn\u2019t his experience to share. It\u2019s true that he\u2019s happy you\u2019re there, but it doesn\u2019t have to be said in this way. \u201cI\u2019m so thankful that my brother is here today\u201d says the same thing that he said, without the details and without bringing the room down.\n\nHaving said that, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s egregious. He could have thought that expressing his thankfulness and love could have been beneficial for you. I think it would have been helpful to stick around to let him know you\u2019d prefer him not to share this stuff, and hear his reasoning behind it.", "NTA to not want your own private life brought up like that in front of a group. While it was probably coming from a good place on his part, you have the right to not want him to bring it up and to leave. He should accept that despite his good intentions it is not something you wanted or liked that he did.", "Ooft this is a tough one. I\u2019m leaning towards NTA, not because of your brothers initial toast (although it was overstepping and inconsiderate, the sincerity salvages it a little) but for calling you a dick and refusing to apologise after you communicated your boundaries. Regardless of his initial intentions with the speech, you\u2019re well within your rights to ask that information to be kept private, and he\u2019s being an asshole by not accepting that.", "NTA\n\nYour tipsy brother toasted your sobriety. The irony would be hilarious if it wasn\u2019t so heartbreaking.", "Nta. You were trying to enjoy your family holiday meal. You didn\u2019t want to be reminded of a time that was difficult. It wasn\u2019t the place or time for your brother to bring it up. Good for you for setting boundaries. And congrats on your one year sobriety!", "I don't blame you for being upset. I don't talk to my brother. Don't blame you one bit.", "NTA your brother's toast was extremely insensitive.", "NTA\n\nSorry Will, say it privately not publicly. Does he want you to relapse or what? It sounds like he could have driven you to the point of taking that next first drink, or score. F Will!", "NTA - Your brother was aware of your situation and should have been sensitive to your feelings when you were celebrating a year of sobriety. He was likely well intentioned, but didn't read the room.  \nNTA but your brother may not understand the effects his words had on you. Try not to punish him too harshly. Talk to him and let him know that his speech was difficult to hear and how it affected you in the moment. Good luck on your journey!", "NTA - Congratulations for such a huge accomplishment!

Own it. Be proud of accomplishing something nearly impossible, kicking an opiode addiction, and being sober for a year.\n\nI suspect your brother's toast was heartfelt. I wouldn't be surprised if he and other members of your family genuinely feared for your life. They likely had many moments when they thought you were completely lost to them.\n\nHe is genuinely thankful that you are still with them and have your shit together.\n\nIt's time you learned that it's not your fuck ups the define you. It's how you deal with them.\n\n---\n\nI am the brother and brother-in-law of addicts. I still love my sibling and am genuinely proud that she is finally 2 years sober. And yes, I feared. Their spouse is one of my favorite people in the world, whom I love to death, and have told him as such.\n\nFor your own sake, don't shy away from your history. What you have accomplished is absolutely amazing and very few can actually do it. Be proud instead of embarrassed and focus on your lessons learned and the road ahead.", "NTA. You're trying to get back to a normal life and he didn't allow that to happen", "I have been in your shoes, and it's awkward AF to be the subject of a toast like that. My first Thanksgiving after getting sober, a family member poured himself a glass of wine, then looked at me like I was a vampire who was about to pounce on him. Family members really don't understand how to interact when someone gets sober, but (at least to me) it comes from a place of love and concern. In genuine efforts to be supportive or respectful, they often end up making the situation even more awkward. \n\nThat said, you should not expect any of them to understand how the toast made you feel unless they have lived your life. Even if you say, \"I really don't like it when you praise me for my sobriety.\" When I initially said that to my family, they were like, \"Why not? You've done an amazing thing! You should be proud.\"\nYes, you should be proud, but that doesn't mean anything about this situation is comfortable or easy. \n\nINFO: Is this the first full-family gathering since you got sober? Has it ever been brought up in a group setting like this before? Have you previously told anyone in your family whether or not you're comfortable discussing your sobriety or your addiction? \n\nI kind of feel like NAH, but your brother would have been much more supportive if he had discussed this toast with you BEFORE he did it to get your consent. He meant well but should not have mentioned your situation specifically. \n\nYou are well within your rights to feel the way you feel and to react the way you did. \n\nSo sorry that happened but congrats!", "NTA. he knows your wouldn't like it toasted like that, and it was distasteful to do it while drunk.", "As a recovering addict I would be MORTIFIED and very pissed off if anyone in my family toasted my sobriety with an alcoholic drink. I do not care how well meaning and sincere they were. That\u2019s like spitting in your face (no matter your drug of choice) \n\nNot only that, I can\u2019t imagine how triggering that might have been for you. I know we are responsible for our own triggers but you don\u2019t \u201ccheers\u201d someone\u2019s sobriety with alcohol. Whole heartedly and emphatically NTA. \n\nCongratulations on your sobriety. I\u2019m very proud of you.\n\nETA: have you introduced your family to Al-Anon? It\u2019s very helpful for family members who\u2019ve had to deal with loved ones who were/are addicts. It may be beneficial in your case as well.", "NAH you are allowed to be embarrassed at that toast and to leave early to collect yourself. Your family had to deal with the trauma of years of jail, rehab and addiction and they\u2019re allowed to be thankful that you\u2019re alive and sober and express that at the family thanksgiving.", "It's called consequences.   Do you think those invited didn't know of your drug habit?   Didn't worry together?   Seek support amongst each other?  \n\nYou felt embarrassed and angry.   Feel those things all you want but accept that you probably should feel embarrassed but it's selfish and immature to feel angry.  How about your family who were worried for your actual life for how many years? How does that even come close to your upset tantrum?   The fact you now won't talk to your brother so your silence manipulates him into sucking up to you to make you feel better?\n\nHaving a close family member so grateful you're still around is a gift.  A damn gift.  You're clean and sober and have a loving family to share life with.... bloody well appreciate it.", "I have a brother who used to be a drug addict and recently stop with alcoholism, maybe he\u2019s saying it as sincere? I probably would have done the same since that is #1 of being grateful is to have my brother back.", "I don\u2019t think YTA, but he isn\u2019t either. My brother was an addict for quite a few years. He finally got clean and has been so for just over 10 years. My family even had a dinner celebrating it. Every year I go out of my way to acknowledge how proud I am of him and of how far he has come. I do it privately though, I don\u2019t think his business is anybody else\u2019s business. That being said, I\u2019m sure your behavior affected everyone in your family. Instead of trying to pretend (like my mom does with my brother) that nothing was ever wrong, he is trying to celebrate your achievements and (in his mind at least) praise you for how well you have done the past year. I\u2019d go have a talk with I\u2019m and tell him how it made you feel. He won\u2019t do it again. You said your self he probably did it out of love. Go have a cup of coffee, clear it up and move on.", "He was trying to compliment you and you got all up in your feelings.

It's about respecting a person's wishes about their own struggle at the end of the day. I know families suffer too but I'm sorry it's still not their story to tell. \n\nBut honestly it's also kind of ridiculous and not very empathetic or mature to call someone a dick for leaving a situation where they were made to feel uncomfortable, even unintentionally - if you'd stormed out immediately after he said it, maybe it would be different, but it sounds like you were very respectful about it and didn't make a scene, waiting until after dinner to leave.

Congratulations, man. I really think that your brother is proud of you and rightly so. Opioid addiction is a fucking beast. \n\nI get that it can be embarrassing for someone to point out something that may feel shameful. It's ok to be embarrassed, but I think you should reach out to your brother and talk it out.\n\nYour family is proud of you, and you did a good job.", "No you're NTA. And you're not the one that should be embarrassed. He's the one that got up there, slightly tipsy, and said how nice it was to have you sober. WTF?", "NTA. I am sure (hopeful) he is thankful that you are alive and doing well (massive congrats by the way \ud83e\udde1), but bringing it up like that in front of everyone, when he was tipsy no less!!, was tactless of him. I can completely understand your embarrassment. Sounds like you need to have a good chat with him about the appropriate ways, times and place (and people) to be bringing it up around/at etc.", "Will owes you a proper apology, with no 'buts', conditions, or modifiers. There are some things you keep shut about especially during family holidays, double especially if it's not your things yourself you're talking about.

Your feelings matter and you deserve to be able to enjoy a holiday dinner without your personal business being brought up in a drunken speech. As for those saying your addiction effected your family too, that depends on the situation. I went through mine alone and kept it secret from family. I dealt with the consequences alone. That said, even if your addiction troubled your loved ones it still doesn't give them the right to embarrass you at a family dinner. Just because someone is an addict doesn't mean they deserve less privacy and dignity. Good luck with your recovery and may you continue to heal.", "NTA, but you might have over reacted because you were embarrassed.\n\nWhen your brother already knows that you don\u2019t like to discuss it in front of others. There\u2019s close family and there\u2019s extended family and your brother could have been mindful of that.\n\nYour brother seems to be genuinely happy for you, but could use some emotional intelligence in this instance. He\u2019s NTA either. Hope you two can talk it out and make him understand how you feel while you stay open minded too :)", "I'm an addict, and have been clean for over 10 years now, and I understand that it embarrassed you BUT sounds like he is really just glad you made it through to the other side alive. Your addiction did affect your family, and their worries are/were valid, so I'm guessing to have you sober and doing great is something that they truly are thankful for, and isn't that what Thanksgiving is all about. Slight YTA.", "NAH. You are allowed to have feelings even if they are bad unfun feelings. You are allowed to deal with those feelings by removing yourself from the room or house, and you're allowed to tell your brother about those feelings and why you're having them.\n\nYour brother was insensitive in his choice of words. It is a raw thing to say - making direct reference to life/death. I would have been upset if someone said that about a friend or family member. But your brother meant it. He meant to celebrate your recovery and used the wrong words to do that.\n\nHug it out or whatever you and your brother do.", "NAH. It's *good* that you are embarassed by your previous way of life - it shows you know better, that your moral compass is intact, and the pain you feel remembering how you were like gives me cause for optimism that you won't go back and will stay on your current path. \n\nI have addictive behaviours too. I've found that to heal relationships my behaviours have impacted that it's important to openly acknowledge that I wasn't that great to be around and that I've done some damage, and that it will take awhile to rebuild trust. If that means leaning in to being the butt of jokes and hurtful comments and saying, yeah, that indeed used to be me, well that's part of the process. There will be better days ahead if you stay the course and trust the higher power.\n\nWhile your brother's toast was worded clumsily, I think you should take his sentiment and desire to celebrate you at face value unless he shows you otherwise. Maybe have a gentle word with him that you're really touchy and embarassed about what a dick you were when you were in the throes of your addictions, but here is an opportunity to show how much you have grown by being the bigger man, acknowledging your past, and forgiving him.", "Soft YTA. You believe he's being genuine and while he should've been a little more tactful, bailing on a Thanksgiving celebration with your family because they are thankful you're sober and in a better place in life is... Seemingly avoiding some accountability.\n\nIt's embarrassing for you to look back at it all, I'm sure-- but they are all looking back at it with overwhelming relief that YOU ARE STILL HERE. Loving an addict is terrifying and life-altering, but they are some of the lucky ones who got to see their loved one come out the other side and make the choice to get sober. They're proud of you. They love you.\n\nYou likely have amends to make and in all honesty, if you can't handle a bit of embarrassment caused by genuine love and relief you're alive, the work of making those amends is going to be miserable.\n\nCongratulations on your sobriety. I hope you remain healthy, happy, and I hope you reach a day where you look back at all of this like your family does- with continued thanksgiving that you are alive. Many are not so lucky.", "NAH.  He's thankful for your recovery.  You wanted a nice family day without any reminders of your struggles.  Unless he's got a strong record of passive aggressiveness, he probably didn't mean to upset you.  But you were upset, and taking yourself out of the situation was better than starting a fight.\n\nTalk to your brother and clear the air.", "NAH. Better leave than doing something that you will regret, but he was being sincere, you shouldnt be embarassed of people around you being happy of your improvement", "NTA, he shouldn't have mentioned it all. It wasn't the right place or time. But it isn't something to be extremely mad at, maybe talk to him and let him know what hurt you.", "NAH\n\nYour brother meant well, I think he is genuinely grateful to still have you in his life, and proud of you for making as profound and difficult a change as you have.\n\nHowever I have crippling social anxiety and hate when a room full of people have their attention on me. I'm not sure if it would have been enough to make me leave, but I would have been quiet and embarrassed the entire time at the very least.\n\nBoth of your feelings are valid. Maybe have a chat with your brother about not liking to have everyone's attention drawn to you. He can still express his love, just not in such a focused situation.", "I\u2019m married to an alcoholic and YTA, dude. Yeah it\u2019s your story, but it\u2019s *their* story too, as they had to suffer through something not of their doing. I understand you\u2019re embarrassed - but dude, you gotta hold that L. That\u2019s what accountability is about.", "I\u2019ll be honest no one is really the ah. I lived with a friend as she got clean and it was the most proud of a person I could ever be, I could never imagine the things she battled with and began to overcome, I moved back home and she relapsed. I have forever felt that is my fault, I know she makes her own decisions in life, but watching her is genuinely so traumatizing. She FaceTimed me while smoking meth, and that\u2019s something I never once wanted to experience, she involved me in her self sabotaging antics and it drained me. I love her with all my heart and hope she can become clean eventually again like you have done(which you should be so proud of yourself for!!), but reality is is that addiction is very hard and traumatic for not only the one experiencing it, but the ones that love and care about the person with addiction. When I say that I hope everyday that she gets clean before she offs herself, I mean that with my whole heart, I worry everyday that she will od or just give up on life. I\u2019m sure your brother felt the same way while you were in addiction. Maybe some day you two can have a heart to heart to both talk about how the whole experience effected the both of you, so you can understand his perspective on it, because I genuinely believe he said that out of love and fear from the past.", "YTA I am a recovering alcoholic been sober 18 months and every time my aunt sees me she tells me how proud of me she is and that it\u2019s as close to a miracle as they come. I am not offended at all by it. I was drinking myself to death. Your family is thankful for you being alive and sober. It wasn\u2019t just you who was affected by your addition. It\u2019s everyone who loves you and is around you.", "NAH\nI'm sure you are well aware that drinking usually makes people more emotional so I'm sure he said it without thinking you might be embarrassed. Maybe he would never say it when the two of you are alone and he thought this was the right time.  \nYou are also entitled to be embarrassed that somebody brought up your failures. But you really should focus on the fact that you actually can feel embarrassed about it,  that shows a great step in your acceptance of your oast behavior as unpleasant for others and is actually a really good thing.  I think it's time for a heart to heart with your bro about how your past affected him,  how he viewed the affect on the family and how you view it. Could be really healing for everyone.", "Does your family somehow not know about your issues?\n\nHave you thought about what they must have gone through dealing with your shit? Do you think you stop using for a bit and everyone just pretends it never happened?\n\nYou massively overreacted to what even you think was a sincere celebration of your progress, YTA", "YTA. Part of recovery is taking accountability for the harm you\u2019ve done to others. They\u2019re allowed to have feelings, and it\u2019s particularly rich to complain about positive ones. \n\nImagine if he\u2019d said \u201cI\u2019m grateful my brother isn\u2019t putting our family through hell this year,\u201d instead.", "NAH your feelings are valid but his intentions were good. I understand being upset and leaving, I understand not wanting your past brought up at a time like that (or at all) but no one was out to get you. You can be embarrassed and upset but you\u2019re acting like he said it to purposely make you feel bad. Sounds like he\u2019s just grateful for the progress you made. If he were to continue to bring it up after this event, I would say he\u2019s an AH. Was it insensitive of him? Maybe, but intention is really important here.", "YTA - substance addiction comes with a huge cost for the loved one of the addicted person.  You may want to act like you are fine now so everyone needs to act like they weren\u2019t effected by your addiction, but that\u2019s bullshit.  Sounds like your family loves and supports you.", "YTA but I get it. I, too, have had issues with substances (alcohol) and am at times deeply embarrassed for the havoc I\u2019ve wreaked over the years. But a crucial part of recovery is accountability. You have to let your loved ones say their piece because addiction is a family disease. They have suffered as a result of your addiction as well. And although maybe those last couple of words might have stung a bit, saying he was thankful for your recovery was very sweet. You have to find that peace within your shame so you can move forward.", "ESH. Your brother was a little passive aggressive in his toast which might have meant more if he were actually sober when making it. You are just a year sober and may be a little too sensitive to the pain you caused your loved ones. \n\nJust be happy that you have another Thanksgiving to spend with your family. Many times they cut you out or something worse happens. \n\nA person's heart can only break so many times before they have to take care of themselves... and dread late night phone calls or knocks on the door.", "Yeahhh you messed up in life. It\u2019s no body\u2019s responsibility but your own if you are offended. He had to watch you throw your life away repeatedly and you get mad for giving you a toast for being alive and well? Get over yourself.", "Soft YTA.\n\nHave you apologized and made reparations to your brother?\n\nBecause the being thankful for \"being together\" and the vague allusion to \"everything that's happened\" sound to me like he's signalling he's willing to skip the apology/forgiveness dance and go straight to reconciliation. \n\nWhich, if a year has passed without explicit apology and forgiveness, is totally understandable. He needs some kind of closure. By mentioning it (however vaguely), he's offering to put it all behind him, even though you've not apologized yet\n\nYour best reaction would be to apologize for being overcome with embarassment, to acknowledge the good intentions behind his statement, and to make some promise to go process your emotions in therapy or AA or something. \n\nI don't think you're ready right now to offer a proper apology for your behaviour during your addiction yet, and your brother has signalled that no apology is expected, so you shouldn't hurry this until you're 100% ready to do it properly.", "Your history is your history. You don't get to pretend it didn't happen. Especially when by your own admission caused lots of problems for your family. Being on drugs that long can make emotions raw. But that is no excuse. \n\nYTA. Grow up ya big baby.", "YTA - I don't see anything negative in that toast. He's thankful that your alive and sober.  What is wrong with that?", "YTA! Selfish", "was this a thanksgiving toast to your sobriety or literal thanksgiving dinner back in november?", "Honestly, it sounds like you still have a lot of sobriety work to do. You've gotten this far, and that's great! But you still have the mentality of someone with addiction issues. You need to understand that you put your family through hell while you were in active addiction. Your addiction was hardly a solitary thing. Just as you needed the space and time to recover from what you did to your life, so does your family. That might include talking about what you put them all through sometimes. Listening to all of this is just part of the accountability you're supposed to be working on during recovery. So if you can't handle this it means you have more work to do. The harsh reality is that your addiction and what you put everyone through weren't secret. Everyone knew and suffered. You have to let everyone tell the truth about it now if you want to get and remain sober. You have to learn to handle the shame and guilt. I know it's hard but the reality is that you more than earned that shame and guilt. That means you're also gonna have to earn everyone else letting go of it. It starts by becoming far less self-centered than this.", "nta, but overreacted", "also wouldnt your family already know youre a recovering addict?", "YTA, the guy is thankful that you are sober and have overcome obstacles that not everyone can conquer! You should be proud and thankful yourself that you have a family including a brother who love you and support your recovery. You should apologize to your brother", "YTA\n\nListen, i get not wanting to be reminded about a part of your past you would rather forget it ever happened. But thats not how it works. As sooner you learn to take accountability for it and accept that this is part of your past and always will be, the sooner you can make peace with it and stop feeling \"embarrassed\". \n\nYour brother is just glad you made it. You should be glad too. No reason to not celebrate this.", "What would have you preferred? Pity the opioids didn\u2019t take you out?", "NTA - what a bizarre way to choose to \"celebrate\" someone's sobriety, by drawing excessive attention to them in front of their entire family and toasting them with alcohol (???). A simple \"glad you're here\" would have sufficed, there was absolutely no need to make a speech. Some in the comments seem to believe that as a recovering addict, you need to slink around in shame and accept whatever your family's reactions are without complaint. I would argue that you did accept it and decided not to make it an issue at Thanksgiving dinner, finished your meal, said your goodbyes, and skipped last call (which you wouldn't have participated in anyways). Maybe Will needs to layoff the alcohol and save \"celebrating\" you for when he's not several drinks deep.", "Am I the only one who thinks toasting to sobriety from alcohol....with alcohol and drunk is rude AF? If the brother hadn't been drunk I would have probably ruled different but NTA for this one. \n\nCongratulations on getting sober!!!", "A very touchy situation. Very easy for the bro to mean well but not quite get it right, and very easy for you to think and feel the worst when you\u2019d prefer not to.\n\nNo assholes here, and great work on what you achieved \ud83d\udc4d", "Mild YTA- He seems to be being sincere.  Perhaps it was brought up in an uncomfortable place, but you have to let your family get their feelings out post addiction.  It\u2019s something we addicts in recovery owe to them.  This is just my opinion though and you are also entitled to be embarrassed.  You will process the feelings and I believe it will make your relationship with your brother stronger in the end.", "NTA. Your brother wasn\u2019t TA either until the way he reacted when you shared your feelings with him. He made your struggle all about himself.", "NAH - He meant well. It's not easy to handle situations like this, and it's bound to be a bit awkward.\n\nI'm a recovering addict as well, and there is no manual for people with regard to how to react. I can absolutely understand your reaction. I would have been really embarrassed myself as well.\n\nI give people a LOT of leeway as long as they have good intentions.\n\nCongrats and good luck with your recovery.", "YTA. Everyone knows what happened, everyone knows how bad things were with you. Acknowledging that and knowing how worse things could do, but how you managed to get better, is an amazing thing and your brother was trying to honour you and your efforts. \n\nYou cannot change the past. And by not accepting what happened and that it affected those around you and that they are happy to still have you, is a shitty thing. \n\nIt\u2019s like saying to a cancer survivor \u201cI\u2019m glad you are here with us\u201d. If the cancer survivor doesn\u2019t accept the fact that their illness deeply affected everyone around them, they are also TA. Yes, you had to go through this, but so did they. And with you being sober, their experience is not worth less, or magically went away. These people stood by you. They had to go through hell for you, with you. Have you ever thought how difficult it must have been for them?", "\nYTA", "I think you overreacted.", "NAH. Your brother was , I think, trying to be supportive in his own idiotic way. Yay alcohol. Probably sit and talk with him about how it made you feel and work out ways to talk about it that don't upset you. Unfortunately this will always be with you. Part of your healing and acceptance of who you are is acknowledging what happened. Nobody in that room was unaware. Nobody didn't worried themselves sick over you. Nobody there didn't want you to be where you are now. Have you a counsellor you can speak with? Find ways to deal with the fact yeah people will know, and those awkward as hell statements, questions, and inadvertent reminders will happen. That's just life. Find your coping mechanism, be they acknowledgement, humour, or whatever (probably not anger; there's space for that but not in this sort of situation). Congratulations on staying clean, it's a lifelong battle but sounds like you're well on your journey.", "NAH. Your brother meant well. He hurt you without meaning too, and now he's probably hurt by your reaction. Sometimes people people get hurt and it's nobody's fault.\n\nThe best possible ending is you both apologize to each other and your brother agrees not to bring this up again at a family gathering.", "NAH. OP is rightfully embarrassed and brother chose the wrong words.", "You can feel however you feel.  But you need to recognize that other people have feelings, too. It sounds like your brother cares about you a lot, so it's not just his gratitude now, but all the years of fear/ sadness/ worry/ anger related to your addiction that lead up to this.  One thing that's really hard about staying sober is dealing with all the emotions you've numbed for years. That emotional intensity is not your brother's fault. Talk to him honestly instead of lashing out or blaming.  Tell him it embarrasses you to have attention called to you and you'd prefer he not do so in the future, but also tell him you're grateful for his care and presence in your life.  NAH", "NTA. Not an appropriate toast in front of everyone.", "I guess you are overreacted", "NAH\n\nYou're allowed to not want to feel vulnerable on a family holiday. Your brother is allowed to feel grateful you're around.", "The man was a full on addict, you embarrassed your family for god knows how long with getting arrested and other shit, and you walk out on your brother congratulating you for getting your life together? Cause you were embarrassed? Lmao the irony is palpable in this story", "ESH. Your brother didn't embarrass you. Your past actions embarrassed you. Did your brother mention it in an inelegant way? Maybe. He is saying he wanted to recognize your accomplishment. You are choosing not to believe him. It's like continuing the addict's typical blaming of others for their addiction. Also, I don't think you are ready (maybe you never will be) to be around people who are imbibing. Either request they do not and make your decision accordingly, or just skip those get togethers.", "YTA. \n\nAs someone who watched opioids and heroine take multiple family members.. including dad, I would have been so excited if I were him to have the chance to see my brother clean.", "NAH\n\nCongrats on a year! I\u2019m thankful you\u2019re alive and sober too. From one recovered opiate addict to another.\n\nWith things still pretty new, it\u2019s understandable to get uncomfortable with the topic being brought up\u2014especially with family.  So I don\u2019t think you\u2019re in the wrong there. \n\nSounds like your brother was being sincere and is genuinely grateful for your progress. So he\u2019s not in the wrong there either. \n\nI\u2019d say leaving early is totally fine. We have to protect what we\u2019ve built, and sometimes those feelings are a little too strong to sit in (in this case, embarrassment/maybe some leftover shame). \n\nI think coming at your brother for it was probably not the right move though. Obviously I don\u2019t know your family dynamics, but we have to let our loved ones process our addictions however they need to, short of some type of actual abuse. If he felt compelled to speak openly about how happy he is to have you present and actively awake at a family event despite your history, then he\u2019s allowed to do that\u2014**even if it makes you feel uncomfortable**. \n\nThe good news is most of that discomfort will subside with time. At almost three years, I can speak openly with my family about the things I did to them. Nowadays, it\u2019s usually my family who wants to shut the conversation down, and I have to respect that for their sake.\n\nIt\u2019s okay to feel embarrassed. But it\u2019s also important to recognize what that toast symbolizes\u2014your brother cares about you enough that he is excited and proud to have to back in his life. That\u2019s a real milestone for you and your family, even if it\u2019s still colored by the uncomfortable shadows of the past. \n\nIf I were your sponsor, I\u2019d tell you to reach out to your brother to thank him for saying what he did, and for being in your life. A lot of addicts never get to reconnect with their families, even with years of sobriety.

If you weren\u2019t comfortable, you have every right to tell him, and ask him not to do the same thing again. Your feelings are valid. He needs to respect that, if he needs support for his associated trauma he needs to do that privately in a way that is for him. \n\nA huge price of addiction is taking back control of your self, your circumstances snd your relationships, and he just shit all over it, whether he meant well or not.

Not by his specific words, but by the manner in which he made the  toast, and by the way he called you a dick when you explained how this was hurtful.\n\nThird, recovering addicts who are actively working on their sobriety already carry an outstanding amount of shame already.  You brother clearly put your shame on display.  \n\nYour brother is clearly TA.  It doesn't really matter what your brother's motives or sincerity are.    (Yes, he was tipsy, but so what?

Your brother is happy you're still alive and wanted to celebrate your sobriety. He may not have had the best execution, but his heart was definitely in the right place. I'm also guessing that your family played a bit of a role in your sobriety. Cut him some slack. Also, you should learn to embrace your addiction and sobriety. It's something you cannot change and I'm certain has only made you a stronger person for having gone through. It's time to stop being embarrassed and start celebrating yourself!

For your consideration\u2026 \n\nTwelve years ago I was at fault in a major car accident. Thankfully no one else was involved and I miraculously had only minor injuries, but the guilt and shame I still feel about the stress it put my family through physically hurts when I think about it too much. Last night near the end of Thanksgiving dinner with our extended family, my sister made a joke about it. I don\u2019t think she intended to be malicious, but it felt mean spirited in the moment and I was shocked, embarrassed, and very hurt that she would bring it up after all this time. I felt exposed and vulnerable. I have had a lot of time to process this experience, and was in the headspace where after a couple of beats, I got up from the table, and when she protested I said, \u201cI\u2019m just not comfortable in this conversation, so I\u2019m going to exit for a bit, it\u2019s all good though.\u201d It obviously was awkward and I was pretty pissed, but am feeling better about it. \n\nI guess my point here is that you will have to live with, and process, all of your feelings around this experience, whatever they may be, and you will likely always be sensitive in some regards when it comes to this. At the same time, your family had their own experience of complicated feelings during that time. If you can, honestly, sometimes the best way to process is to share in that healing experience with the ones who love you. Your brother I think was coming from that place, though I totally understand if you aren\u2019t there yet. I haven\u2019t resolved things with my sister, it\u2019s a bit too raw, but in the next couple of days I\u2019m going to pop a letter in the mail that just tells her why I took it so hard, and hope to give her an understanding that it still is a super tough thing for me and although I\u2019m not angry at the joke or her thoughts on the experience from her perspective, it\u2019s a sensitive topic for me and will probably always hurt a bit and I need her to know that so she can conduct herself with my feelings in mind when it comes to this. For me, the letter is my choice because my sister and I can both be fiery and I want to give her a chance to read it and reflect on it rather than respond, while still knowing that I took the time to thoughtfully share versus send a quick text. \n\nTherapy and Brene Brown\u2019s work on shame and vulnerability really helped me understand my feelings around the accident. \n\nTake care.", "As someone who has been in your exact situation, I wouldn\u2019t take it too hard. I\u2019d wager that he was being sincere. A lot of people have no idea how to navigate talking about addiction and recovery and tend to say some colorless things when trying to be well meaning. Sometimes it\u2019s easy to let our own suffering overshadow the fact that we also put our families through hell. \n\n Multiple family members have expressed similar sentiments to me, both in group settings and in private. And every time I hear their words and am thankful that I have people in my life who love and support me and are genuinely thankful that I\u2019m alive and present.

He loves her so much and would do anything for her.

I believe the brother had good intentions, but OP isn\u2019t an AH for leaving. He\u2019s still allowed to have boundaries and feelings just because he\u2019s an addict. He\u2019s still a person.\n\nETA: I\u2019m a recovering addict myself and met many others struggling with addiction in treatment. I\u2019m not an expert by any means, but the vast majority of addicts I  have met deserve to go through and feel their guilt for their actions and make their amends, but they don\u2019t deserve to live in shame. guilt and shame are very different, and shame only makes recovery harder. I find this article helpful in distinguishing between the two in the context of addiction: https://www.goodrx.com/conditions/substance-use-disorder/how-shame-and-guilt-fuel-addiction", "Becoming sober doesn't mean that everybody needs to instantly forget every piece of harm you've done or deny that you may relapse. \n\nAddicts break their families' trust.

I have a brother who's an addict - do you know how many awkward moment we've had because of his addiction? How uncomfortable and awkward it is to ruin my parents' day when I had to tell them that my brother stole from me AGAIN. How uncomfortable I've been for almost 15 years every time someone asks about him. How uncomfortable everyone is at a family gathering when he shows up visibly high and nodding out at dinner? \n\nHoly shit is the least exaggerated phrase I've seen around this question.", "Not really. He is an addict that has a lot of confidence issues. People on Reddit love to dump on recovering addicts. Hell, almost every person upvoting \"holy shit\" guy are doing so because they would absolutely love to read that OP regressed and fell back into drugs.  That just how aita kids operate. \n\nOP had a weak moment and now aita needs their pound of flesh. I'm sure you will all be rock hard when the BoRU drops about him falling back into drugs.  \n\nThe best part is, if this story got posted on a different day, it's just as likely that OP would be voted NTA and everyone would be shitting on the brother.", "Nah", "Is the time to be angry during a holiday meal in front of everyone?

However I don't think it was really a thing everyone was angry about in this situation. It sounds like it more or less made people uncomfortable. I will say though, as someone with family in recovery, I definitely don't toast my alcoholic relatives on the road to recovery. I'm not saying the guy isn't going to have to get through his obvious shame he feels, but it feels a bit out of touch to put them on the spot when they've already been making large improvements. You made great points though undoubtedly and I can see how my answer may have seemed off putting to the family members who lived it.

It\u2019s really sweet that the brother is (presumably) genuinely proud and happy for OP for what he has accomplished and brought it up to celebrate him. However, there is a time and place to express that, and I feel like it\u2019s glaringly obvious that a family thanksgiving dinner is not the time to do so especially in the way that he did. His intention may have been great, but his impact was not. He could\u2019ve just toasted to his brother in general, or to his year of sobriety and left it at that. Instead, he was drinking and sounds like rambling a bit about OP\u2019s addiction. OP is allowed to have boundaries. Addiction isn\u2019t something he chose to have because it is awesome for him and everyone involved. It\u2019s a horrible thing. It is likely he had trauma and developed addiction as a maladaptive coping mechanism. Having been in treatment myself, that\u2019s how it is for most addicts. To be reminded of that suffering, for everyone, in such a way at what is supposed to be a day off for loved ones to be together - I imagine if I were in OP\u2019s shoes I would have been very embarrassed and would\u2019ve done the same thing. He didn\u2019t blow up at his brother, he excused himself after sharing the meal so as not to make a scene. He left the situation that was triggering him. I really don\u2019t see how people here think what he did makes him an AH. Just because he\u2019s an addict? What a horrible way to think about people who have suffered through it. I could even see a NAH because it sounds like this family hasn\u2019t gone through Al-Anon and doesn\u2019t know better. \n\nThis is not to say we shouldn\u2019t have empathy for the people he may have hurt through his addiction, but part of recovery is making amends. That does not mean it\u2019s okay to hold someone\u2019s struggle over their head and saying well you earned your shame, you\u2019ve done worse, so we get to embarrass you at thanksgiving and you just need to buck up and deal with it. Not saying the brother did that but the people here in the comments sure are.", "It's not that they can't say these things, I think it's about the timing/situation.

It\u2019s a very ugly thing that hurts everyone involved and I feel so much shame and anger towards myself for putting them through that.

He's a **person** with feelings, not an object to be used for others' edification.", "Why can't that be the focus later though? OP never mentioned that he never talks about it and never lets anybody brings it up. He says not at family gatherings. He says brother knew that and still went ahead with his speech.\n\nThat's straight up stomping on a small simple boundary. That's telling him 'I don't care if you're uncomfortable'. That's telling him his feelings don't matter. That's telling him he doesn't have a safe space with the people he loves, who he desperately needs while in recovery.\n\nI feel for the family, I do. But I recognize that OP was hurt and that it Still Matters, too. Calling him the AH for something like this just tells him he needs to sit down and shut up in any instance, because he was Sick. Yeah, doesn't excuse what he did, but he still deserves to have his boundaries respected.", "*If your family cuts you off*\n\nMy bil stole constantly, destroyed property, and physically threatened me, someone half his size.  Addiction or not, that's not someone that's going to be in my life if I can help it.\n\n*If you want to associate with an addict you either treat them like you would every other human*\n\nI did treat him like I treated other thieves, vandals, and physically dangerous men.  At arms length, until they showed a substantial period of reform.  I have the right to feel safe in my own home, even if there is a medical reason for his behavior.\n\nAddiction is an explanation, not a blanket pass. If addicts can't understand the harm that they caused, they need more therapy.", "Dude I\u2019m not saying they aren\u2019t people I\u2019m saying they are victims. Do you think anyone wakes up and is like I wanna be an addict??? Of course not. By casting this blanket of guilt upon every single addict you reduce them to their addiction, something I hope you never have to experience.", "You know, I wasn't going to reply, but since I am being forced to think hard about addict behaviour today, I will. \n\nAs the daughter, sister, grand-daughter, niece, cousin, aunt, and ex-wife of addicts let me tell you, being reminded in the mildest possible way that your past behaviour made everyone worry whether you would live to see another Thanksgiving? Not very high on the embarrassment scale. Wouldn't even crack the top 100 for me.  \n\nThe families of addicts endure a whole crap ton more embarassment than this, OP should be Thankful they are all there, celebrating his recovery, and hadn't cut him off years ago. \n\nOP left a family celebration in a huff, and was asked by his brother why he did so. When OP told him it was because \"(he) was pissed, and (brother) embarrassed him\", at which point his brother called him a dick. If you honestly think that constitutes \"lashing out\" then you have had a remarkably easy time in life, because that is pretty mild in my book. \n\nAs you say, there was no ill intent from his brother. After all the hurt, pain and yes, embarrassment OP has almost certainly caused through his addiction, he needed to move past it. \n\nHis family is not obligated to pretend his addiction never happened to OP or to them. I guarantee you, every single person in that room was already aware of OP's addiction past, they got silent because they were remembering their own interactions with OP, and being grateful he's more or less through it. \n\nIf that makes you angry, or makes you think that 'people hate addicts', then that's on you. Those of you downvoting should be thinking about why you are having this reaction. I mean, I know you won't, but you should.", "Hey I noticed a bunch of your comments and was starting to get edgy feeling like you were posing as \u201ccurious\u201d when you were actually being critical. \n\nI want to, very sincerely, commend you for proving me wrong. You clearly asked questions and thought this one out. As an alcoholic with five years of sobriety, still working through the tangle of shame, I really appreciate your willingness to consider OP\u2019s humanity. \n\nSometimes when my mom hugs me she discreetly sniffs me, searching for the scent of alcohol. There\u2019s lots of things like that. I embraced sobriety and never looked back, but like many others, because I want to be close to my family, I will always be confronted with that guilt and wrestle with the idea that I deserve it for disappointing the people who love me. It\u2019s hard to feel entitled to pride in sobriety. And OP\u2019s situation is so much more nuanced than a lot of people here realize. Thank you for picking up on that and pursuing understanding. This might seem silly to you, but it\u2019s a bit healing.", "Dude come on, no one is saying that isn\u2019t traumatic and horrible in its own right. Just saying OP is still a person allowed to have feelings and boundaries. He\u2019s not an AH for leaving a triggering environment, imagine that caused a relapse. Absolutely never implied it\u2019s not hard for his loved ones, he didn\u2019t either.", "What do you mean? I am genuinely confused by this question. Why would people having the right to express their feelings as a concept put someone off relationships as a concept? Feels like I'm missing something you're saying, but I'm not sure what it is.", "People can be addicted to pretty much anything, including food. And the OP said himself that he believed his brother was sincere in the fact that he wanted to celebrate his sobriety.", "Thanks for giving me a chance kind person! Haha. I may not have the best phrasing but it all comes from genuine want to understand. I came from a family thay doesnt say positive things out loud so Im at the \"ill take what i can get\" mindset with the brother so i know my thoughts can be misguided sometimes. Congrats on your sobriety! Hope you have a great holiday season and rest of your life ahead.", "OP used to be a struggling addict. If there is any reason that he does not want it brought up, that sentiment should be respected. People who have self inflicted trauma should not be flogged just because they have been a pain to themselves and others. The point of relationships is that nothing is perfect and to expect some understanding is necessary. If everyone has a right to express their feelings, relationships won\u2019t last. Consideration over the truth is sometimes necessary and prudent.", "They don\u2019t need a toast to be reminded", "So if I was thankful that I fucked ur mom, that's all good to declare in front of the entire family in ur opinion?", "An addict who is clean never stops struggling. An addict takes and takes every last thing they can from those around them until they crater into rock bottom. That is going to have a lasting effect on those still around. \n\nThe brother didn't mention the mental trauma he likely experienced, nor the fear and the hopelessness of his prior situation. He simply expressed that he was thankful for his brother still being there.", "One could say the same about caffeine or processed sugar - but realistically very few people live that sort of life. But more importantly, they are ingrained into our society so deeply it takes literal effort to avoid those things - you can't even go to a restaurant without encountering recipes with booze in them. So by avoiding them completely, aren't you still living your life around them, just as an averse style instead? Someone who has learned to consume these addictive substances reasonably and in moderation isn't always on the lookout for them, asking \"is there caffeine/sugar/alcohol in this?\", so the substance isn't living rent free in their head. Just a bit of perspective \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Listen, I get what you're trying for here, but it's falling flat to me.\n\nThe main point that you keep brushing over is OP didn't want it at the family event. That's a totally valid thing to want. Regardless if it was a celebration or not, some people just don't want it and that should be respected.\n\nIf it's not, it alienates the person you're trying to celebrate and makes them not want to come, even without something as hard and damaging as addiction.\n\nIf a person wants to keep those celebrations private, let them.\n\nThis wasn't supposed to be a moment about OP and his addiction. The brother could have even included that he was thankful that OP was still there without singling him out or bringing up his addiction. The fact he didn't and responded angrily when told he embarrassed his brother makes him an AH.\n\n'If you don't want someone to add you to a speech and specifically bring up the worst time in your life for everyone you love to ruminate on, you don't accept love' is an awful take. Some people just don't like that and some people are too early in their recovery for these things to be helpful.\n\nOP is allowed to not want this brought up at family gatherings and allowed to be upset when it is.\n\nBrother crossed a boundary and embarrassed OP, OP quietly left at a suitable moment to not make a scene, and later when asked, expressed his feelings about what happened, and people are telling him here that he did it wrong, because he felt a certain way as an addict in recovery.\n\nThat's what it comes down to and it's a shit take."]}
