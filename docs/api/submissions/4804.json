That\u2019s another stressor. There\u2019s a cabinet that I keep my siblings snacks in while they\u2019re here. Recently, I got another one, and I keep my THC snacks in.

My mom knew I was home and dropped my sibling off. \n\nShe couldn\u2019t reach the snack cabinet, so she unlocked my THC cabinet and told my sibling not to touch anything in it other than snacks.

There should have been 20 gummies, 4 cookies, and 8 brownies, but there was only 15 gummies, 1 cookie, and 6 brownies. I then heard sobbing from the bathroom.

He was clearly impaired, and he didn\u2019t know what was going on or what to do. \n\nI called mom and asked her what to do. She was there in like 30 seconds, and she rushed my sibling to the ER. He is completely fine now. I don\u2019t know what happened between her and the doctor, but she told me I\u2019m not in trouble. She said I will be if I don\u2019t pay the ER bill, which is something like 5500 dollars. I said hell no, if anything, she should give me money for the weed. She said she would sue me, and I said I would never be her free baby sitter if she tried. I said she needs to be more responsible, and told her that if she isn\u2019t, my siblings will get hurt. \n\nI said if she sues me, I will cut out my entire family. Now people are calling me the asshole, and they\u2019re threatening legal stuff, none of which I know or am prepared for. I think my mom was in the wrong, but I thought back to my baby sibling crying in the bathtub. AITA?

Your mom sucks because she's an absent parent who's completely dependent on her adult child for free child care. Then threatens you to cover her ass after you informed her of the situation.\n\nYou suck for different reasons. The first is that you clearly can not care for children in this specific situation. If you're sick or can't get out of bed for whatever reason, then you have to say no to your mom. If no is never an option, change your locks, and tell her that she can only drop them off whenever you say yes. Or else, unfortunately, you have to stand your ground by saying I can't let my sibling in because I literally can't care for a 5 year old right now. The second reason you suck is that you say a 5 year unlocked your cabinet. If a 5 year old can unlock a cabinet with drugs in it (legal, medical, or not), then the cabinet is either really not locked or there's a key that your siblings knows about. Why is that specific cabinet even in their reach in the first place? That should be totally separated in your room or some place that they can not access. Also a weed cookie IS food. It's not like food, it IS food.\n\nMaybe a cabinet isn't even the best option for your THC. That's like putting a weed cookie on the counter. Lets say you have a dog. You know your dog can get on the counter and love cookies. Your dog eats the cookie and gets sick. Is that the dog's fault for not understanding what a weed cookie is or your fault for leaving it where he could get it? The only difference between my hypothetical and what you did was add an easily accessible cabinet that is supposed to deter a cookie-loving kid, which clearly doesn't work. \n\nThis leads me to my final point: you are getting screwed by your Mom. I think you have an issue with boundaries, so it's really hard to tell her no. But thimi 66t situation to cut her off, grab a lawyer and set some serious boundaries. Because I'm worried you're gonna look at this situation and stop ingesting weed, when the real problem is that your Mom could give a shit about listening to you, doesn't inform her 5 yr old to stay out of your cabinet and now threatens you because of her animosity towards you.  You aren't equipped to babysit right now because if you havwax m MMB 49\u00ecr e no boundaries with your siblings, your mom wont enforce any boundaries allowed for a kid to eat a weed cookie and got really sick. Your heart can be in the best place, but the consequences will always outweigh the intentions. Even if those consequences are unintentional. Your mom doesn't have a case, especially if you let her know, but I just think you need to rethink your security of your edibles/paraphernalia if you are gonna watch children. I say this as a medical THC user as well. When my nephews come to my place, I lock all my weed stuff in a safe in my room. You don't even need a safe, maybe just a lock for your door or something.\n\nI also want to add that this is clearly a mistake and it was unintentional.

Your city may have their own laws.  The chances of you being in violation of the law are not high, but even then - the chances of the cops coming after you and pressing charges when you DID have them stored legally in a locked box are slim to none. Even should she try to deny that SHE unlocked the box, end of the day, this is more of a CPS issue than it is a police matter.  The police are just going to refer this case directly to CPS.

But do whatever the lawyer says", "Do you have her saying this in the form of text messages?\n\nThe best thing you can do to protect yourself it to get her to admit it via text.\n\nGetting her to outright admit to everything is a stretch and suss so the best thing you can do is continually question her on how she opened your cabinet.\n\nThat way literally all you need is for her to say \"it doesn't matter how I opened it\" and you will have evidence that 1. She was the one who gave them access, and 2. That she dropped them off without your permission.", "If it's like one of those locks you see on a drawer, or an old display case, those are insanely easy to pick open with a bobby pin. I learned how to pick them as an almost teen when my mother put a lock on her drawer. \n\nWhy you ask? Because I kept losing my tweezers and brush then using and losing hers. ADHD combined with selfish teen motives smh...", "INFO: What kind of lock is on the weed cabinet? Does it show any signs of having been tampered with? Any scratches? Is it a lock that could be easily picked or jimmied?", "CPS are not criminal investigators. They will gather info from more than one incident. If mom is negligent like this it is probably not the first or only time. They assess whether the kids are in danger, monitor the situation, and try to help the parents before taking any action.", "Brenda (mom) dropped off the child unannounced and witnout permission per OP's comments.

They asked her how she got into it since the key is kept in a separate lock box in a separate room. She said it wasn't an important detail. This woman knew and didn't care.\n\nI feel so terrible for that poor baby. The first time I did pot I got a little too high (I've learned I have a very sensitive physiology. Alcohol, medications, it does not take much to have an effect.) and felt horrible and it was only too big a hit from a bong. I can't imagine how that kiddo was feeling and how scared they must have been. Makes me so angry at that fucking egg donor.", "So when you say cabinet, you mean some sort of enclosed box?  Personally, I think of cabinets as things that are attached to the walls with doors that swing outwards, so what I visualized from the original post is not what you're describing here.

But you still better believe I would sue the ever-loving fuck out of someone if my child ingested bleach and had to be hospitalized because of them. Now in this particular situation, mom is in the wrong because she is the reason that the child ingested the substance but this is still easily within the parameters for child abuse.", "They may come after OP.

Your mom for her clear neglect of her child by dropping the child off without ensuring appropriate supervision and allowing access to known drugs, and lying to medical professionals. You for your irresponsible keeping of your marijuana, and not immediately knowing to take your sibling to the ER. You all seem more concerned about the consequences of your actions than you are about the health of a small child. Your mom needs some serious help in figuring out a safe child care option, because you aren\u2019t it. And you have some growing up to do.

Literally none of this is OP\u2019s fault and could probably be proved through text messages.", "Okay, how about this. I had absolutely no idea he was going to be in my house, so would it make sense to plan for someone to be there while I was sick? I made a reasonable assumption, plus it was locked. And I\u2019m supposed to plan for someone to break into my home? That\u2019s like leaving bread on your counter, and when someone with a wheat allergy breaks into your home and eats it, your the bad guy for leaving it on the counter. \n\nThe reason I didn\u2019t instantly take him to the ER is because this was a completely new situation for me, I didn\u2019t know what to do. It is on a counter away from people when I expect people over.

I had pot snacks locked in a cabinet. I had previously told her I had pot snacks in the cabinet and that is the reason it is locked. She UNLOCKED the cabinet and told my siblings they could eat the stuff in there. So, let me be clear. I keep my pot locked. My mother dropped the kids off unannounced and GAVE them edibles from my pot cabinet which she had to unlock to do so. I refuse to take responsibility for her terrible parenting and the resulting injury to her children when I did everything I possibly could have in my own home to ensure they were not accessible to children. And they wouldn't have been had she not unlocked the cabinet for the purposes of giving them access to the edibles.\"", "I can answer this one: it's not her house and it's none of her business where he keeps the snacks!"]}
