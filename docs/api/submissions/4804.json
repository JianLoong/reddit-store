That\u2019s another stressor. There\u2019s a cabinet that I keep my siblings snacks in while they\u2019re here. Recently, I got another one, and I keep my THC snacks in.

My mom knew I was home and dropped my sibling off. \n\nShe couldn\u2019t reach the snack cabinet, so she unlocked my THC cabinet and told my sibling not to touch anything in it other than snacks.

There should have been 20 gummies, 4 cookies, and 8 brownies, but there was only 15 gummies, 1 cookie, and 6 brownies. I then heard sobbing from the bathroom.

He was clearly impaired, and he didn\u2019t know what was going on or what to do. \n\nI called mom and asked her what to do. She was there in like 30 seconds, and she rushed my sibling to the ER. He is completely fine now. I don\u2019t know what happened between her and the doctor, but she told me I\u2019m not in trouble. She said I will be if I don\u2019t pay the ER bill, which is something like 5500 dollars. I said hell no, if anything, she should give me money for the weed. She said she would sue me, and I said I would never be her free baby sitter if she tried. I said she needs to be more responsible, and told her that if she isn\u2019t, my siblings will get hurt. \n\nI said if she sues me, I will cut out my entire family. Now people are calling me the asshole, and they\u2019re threatening legal stuff, none of which I know or am prepared for. I think my mom was in the wrong, but I thought back to my baby sibling crying in the bathtub. AITA?

Your mom sucks because she's an absent parent who's completely dependent on her adult child for free child care. Then threatens you to cover her ass after you informed her of the situation.\n\nYou suck for different reasons. The first is that you clearly can not care for children in this specific situation. If you're sick or can't get out of bed for whatever reason, then you have to say no to your mom. If no is never an option, change your locks, and tell her that she can only drop them off whenever you say yes. Or else, unfortunately, you have to stand your ground by saying I can't let my sibling in because I literally can't care for a 5 year old right now. The second reason you suck is that you say a 5 year unlocked your cabinet. If a 5 year old can unlock a cabinet with drugs in it (legal, medical, or not), then the cabinet is either really not locked or there's a key that your siblings knows about. Why is that specific cabinet even in their reach in the first place? That should be totally separated in your room or some place that they can not access. Also a weed cookie IS food. It's not like food, it IS food.\n\nMaybe a cabinet isn't even the best option for your THC. That's like putting a weed cookie on the counter. Lets say you have a dog. You know your dog can get on the counter and love cookies. Your dog eats the cookie and gets sick. Is that the dog's fault for not understanding what a weed cookie is or your fault for leaving it where he could get it? The only difference between my hypothetical and what you did was add an easily accessible cabinet that is supposed to deter a cookie-loving kid, which clearly doesn't work. \n\nThis leads me to my final point: you are getting screwed by your Mom. I think you have an issue with boundaries, so it's really hard to tell her no. But thimi 66t situation to cut her off, grab a lawyer and set some serious boundaries. Because I'm worried you're gonna look at this situation and stop ingesting weed, when the real problem is that your Mom could give a shit about listening to you, doesn't inform her 5 yr old to stay out of your cabinet and now threatens you because of her animosity towards you.  You aren't equipped to babysit right now because if you havwax m MMB 49\u00ecr e no boundaries with your siblings, your mom wont enforce any boundaries allowed for a kid to eat a weed cookie and got really sick. Your heart can be in the best place, but the consequences will always outweigh the intentions. Even if those consequences are unintentional. Your mom doesn't have a case, especially if you let her know, but I just think you need to rethink your security of your edibles/paraphernalia if you are gonna watch children. I say this as a medical THC user as well. When my nephews come to my place, I lock all my weed stuff in a safe in my room. You don't even need a safe, maybe just a lock for your door or something.\n\nI also want to add that this is clearly a mistake and it was unintentional. You probably have a huge heart, and by no means am I saying you are at fault for an incident your mom caused. Your mother morally is at fault. I'm just saying you suck, in the rubric of this sub, but I don't think you are a bad person or sister by any means. I think you are fantastic one! I'm just adding the nuance that you have to be more careful if you CHOOSE to watch the kid.", "OP needs to get the locks changed at her home ASAP, so Mom can\u2019t dump kids on her again.", "Hey y'all - jumping on top comment to add this:   \n\n\nNTA \n\nOP  Change the locks on the outer door and the weed cabinet, and ***save your receipts.*** Should Mom be so stupid as to try to make something legal out of this, having proof that you cut off your mom's access to your home immediately after the incident will bolster your claims.", "This is the correct answer, although I am not sure mom is stable enough to care for them anyway, if she has a habit of just dropping them off.\n\nOP, you are NTA, but you need to establish some boundaries with your mom. This is not ok behavior.", "This. Also, while you are at it, get your locks changed. Do not give mom keys to anything. Give her no access to your house. You do not owe her babysitting. Stop doing it.\n\nNTA", "Might as well just give the kids access to a liquor cabinet too.", "Breaking and entering.\n\nChild abandonment.\n\nKnowing giving under ages access to controller drugs.\n\nI'm probably missing lots more the the AH did while OP was asleep.", "There should be no *threat* in the scenario.  CALL CHILD PROTECTIVE SERVICES.", "It appears Mum has a key which should be revoked and locks changed as well.", ">and she UNLOCKED it\n\nI'm just thinking about liability issues in my plant at work. If something is extremely dangerous and is always locked, then I go over and unlock it, and then I walk away, then I am liable if someone else gets hurt.", "Not to mention how clearly marked dispensary products are she could have literally taken 2 seconds to make sure what she was giving the kids access to was normal snacks \ud83d\ude43 a judge will probably laugh her out of court if she tries", "This 100%. NTA", "Yeah don\u2019t talk to CPS or anyone from the government unless its through a lawyer. I have no idea why you are recommending giving them information that isn\u2019t verifiable by CPS that could put OP on the hook. OP tells this story and CPS only knows two things for sure, OP had weed, and kids at OPs house got into it.\n\nSo so so dumb.", "NTA - This completely, OP. You have done everything right, but your mother has not. You need to call CPS, because your mother is being ridiculously reckless and irresponsible with the safety of her young children. She should not be dropping them off unannounced at a home where the adult she wants to watch them is sound asleep and unaware that any child has been dropped off. She gave your sibling access to a cabinet that she knew contained substances children should not have. What if your sibling got into pills and took a bunch of them thinking they were candy? What if they got a knife out of the kitchen for whatever reason and severely injured themselves. There are so many terrible things that can happen when a child is unsupervised, and your mother is the one who is ultimately responsible for making sure that your siblings/her young children are being appropriately cared for. She failed to do that, and your siblings will unfortunately continue paying the price for her actions until she is stopped or something happens to them that cannot be remedied.", "Plus, it\u2019s better to attack this head on", "The more I think about it, the more I don\u2019t think the actual bill is that much. From other comments, I would wager to say she\u2019s just trying to cheat me out of some money", "I always ask myself if a story makes sense. I mean, here is OP, being very conscientious about locking up her stash and avoiding involving Mom in her cannabis adventures. Then she gives Mom the key to her stash box? People give a copy of their house or apartment key to family all the time, yes. But just who gives their emergency house key holder the key to their cannabis stash box? \n\nWhy people exercise their fiction writing skills here is a mystery to me. But I'm pretty sure almost 50 percent of the posts reaching the first page in this sub are fiction.", "I\u2019m leaning towards idiot", "I know, I keep thinking about that poor baby. I know how high I got from one brownie. Poor little guy probably had to have his stomach pumped.", "My weed card lol", "OP was asleep and unaware his mother was dropping his sibling off. He didn't have the opportunity to say no. \n\nOP's mother is the one who unlocked the cabinet, not their 5 year old sibling.", "There is an app called tansee or you can find it online and it will log the texts with date and time stamps and the phone numbers the messages are being sent with.", "Perhaps springing for an attorney would be a good idea. Then you can talk to CPS *and* law enforcement about the attempted extortion. Your mom dropped the kid off while you were asleep, after you said no to watching them,  unlocked the weed cabinet and told them to have at it with \"just the snacks\" and is now threatening you if you don't pay up for the emergency room bill. OP, when this is over, I'd put as much distance between myself and that woman as possible. Create your own family. Things will get better.", "OP has edited their post and changed all the CBD to THC since they commented.", "yeah that\u2019s fair, gut reaction was to make a police report but you\u2019re right. Getting a lawyer is the right call", "Oh that\u2019s good!  I was worried you might get deported over this since pot is still illegal at the federal level.", "Sounds like B&E to me. I'd honestly file a police report. She stole from you and endangered her child in your property.", "I would ask her. And if not, WHY not? This is absolutely not your responsibility.", "You can babysit your siblings while also having boundaries. Only do so when you have agreed in advance and possibly for pay. Your mom clearly has no respect for you and thinks she can do whatever she wants in regard to you. The only way that will stop is if you make it stop.", "Yeah 100%\n\nThe amount that kid ate is a straight up dangerous amount. Not physically, but mentally for sure. Feel so bad for the poor little kiddo, glad he sounds like he's doing better now, he must've been so confused and terrified \ud83d\udc94", "That kid could have passed out and choked on his own puke - similar to alcohol poisoning.", "Weed is decriminalized in Colorado it is still illegal on a federal level so you will not face any punishments for possession on a state level they could make a federal case out of it.", "The kids who ate the thc food are witnesses, they can tell CPS/DCFS, whatever it's called, who gave them the snacks.", "Precisely. Also, document everything that\u2019s gone on and continue to with additional interactions. Lastly,  understand your mom didn\u2019t lie to cover you, she lied to the ER to cover herself. She left a child unattended and specifically opened up a cabinet the child wouldn\u2019t have had access to without her actions, after being told specifically what was inside. She knows she effed up.", "Yesterday sounds about right.", "That was my thought as well", "Of course, the likelihood that she perjures herself by claiming that she didn't touch the cabinet, that OP gave his siblings drugs intentionally/was negligent in babysitting duties, and she was trying to be a \"good mother\" by lying for him at the ER is near 100%. Why do you need to have a coherent story if you have crocodile tears?", "Found that both surprising and odd that didn't happen.", "Gotcha.", "I wouldn\u2019t call someone who uses THC a druggie.  I wouldn\u2019t call anyone who drinks an alcoholic.  This is a big stretch", "Some locks these days shouldn't even be legally allowed to call itself a lock given how easy they are to open without the proper key. And I'm not just talking about things the lock picking laywer can do, but he shows you so many horrible products that might as well just be an open door.", "Apologies :)  I'll edit", "It would make mom look far less credibly as it would aline more with OP's story.", "[deleted]", "Please forgive me, I am not trying to be obtuse, but I truly do not understand. Can you elaborate?", "Bro. They\u2019re the same age, I just don\u2019t know if they\u2019re five or six. And yes. I do. It became an issue because the place where we were keeping the snacks, the ones I don\u2019t touch, kept getting mice. I thought it would be fun to make a chest with them out of clay. For Christmas I had the rough sculpture turned into an actual cabinet and when I asked them what they were gonna use it for, they said they wanted it to be their snack box. It was really cute, stop bashing my god. I\u2019ve tried to be respectful and help, but you\u2019re just being a negative dick.", "Not that poster, but I think they're trying to say that the possible defense of \"it wasn't locked properly\"/\"the lock wasn't on\"/\"the cabinet was open to start with\" on Mom's part would be easily disproven if- IF- he either has some method of proving the lock was there to start with (video, pictures, etc) or he has a method of proving that the information that the cabinet in question was explicitly the wrong one, that she was not allowed to give anyone things from it, and that doing so violated the wishes of OP.  \n\n\nOr maybe they mean a lock monitor? Or even just a latch for the lock to sit on, rather than looping through handles or somesuch? The structure being in place to start lends credence to \"this is normally a locked cabinet\".  \n\n\nAll this is kinda irrelevant in the long run, as if any of this is via text message or other recordable media it speaks for itself, but.", "[deleted]", "But in all those scenarios, even if the cabinet were locked and there was some proof of the time it was opened, that wouldn't exhonorate OP from being the one who opened it right? Or am I missing something?", "I am so sorry my dude for all that happened to you. You don't deserve what is happening to you. NTA and I wish you the best. You deserve people in your life that care about you.\n\nYou should check out resources about narcissistic parents. They often pick a child to be a scapegoat for their problems and treat another as a \"golden child.\" While I am not a clinician, your mother's behavior and your description of how she treated you growing up ring alarm bells in my head.\n\nhttps://www.verywellhealth.com/narcissistic-parent-5213058", "Dropping off her kids without telling you/without your knowledge is also considered abandonment by CPS/legally, she shouldn't be doing this.", "My dude, as soon as anyone uses you, isn't grateful, and tells you YOU aren't in trouble, threatens to litigate to take your money away from yous - it's time to let go and file for a restraining order.  There are some things you cannot apologize for, and in this situation they aren't even remorseful, they are blaming you for having legal intoxicants in your own home.  \n\nYour siblings will get older and you can have a relationship with them then, and you get to explain how messed up thier parent is for doing these things to yous.", "Y'know, for saying OP isn't an AH, you sure are treating like they are. Way to be uber judgy.", "I guess it's not a smocking gun as much as it is \"yeah, the cabinets are supposed to be locked. They're literally built to be.\"  \n\n\nBut like I said, I'm guessing."]}
