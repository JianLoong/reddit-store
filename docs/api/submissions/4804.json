My mom knew I was home and dropped my sibling off. \n\nShe couldn\u2019t reach the snack cabinet, so she unlocked my THC cabinet and told my sibling not to touch anything in it other than snacks.

He was clearly impaired, and he didn\u2019t know what was going on or what to do. \n\nI called mom and asked her what to do. She was there in like 30 seconds, and she rushed my sibling to the ER.

She said she would sue me, and I said I would never be her free baby sitter if she tried. I said she needs to be more responsible, and told her that if she isn\u2019t, my siblings will get hurt. \n\nI said if she sues me, I will cut out my entire family.
