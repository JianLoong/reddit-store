I have my green card, despite weed being legal, so I recently started getting THC infused products. I don\u2019t have a good relationship with mom (56f). She had 2 kids by the time I turned 17, so I\u2019m not close with my siblings. It was a high risk pregnancy, so my mom always payed more attention to them and loves them more, which strained our relationship. \n\nShe occasionally asks me to watch my siblings, and sometimes she just drops them off. That\u2019s another stressor. There\u2019s a cabinet that I keep my siblings snacks in while they\u2019re here. Recently, I got another one, and I keep my THC snacks in. I told my mom not to touch it, it doesn\u2019t have my siblings snacks in it, and that it\u2019s got weed stuff in it. She said she thought I meant pills or oils or something, not food, but I was specific to tell her that some of it looked like food too. I was home sick the other day and sleeping. My mom knew I was home and dropped my sibling off. \n\nShe couldn\u2019t reach the snack cabinet, so she unlocked my THC cabinet and told my sibling not to touch anything in it other than snacks. She then told my sibling that if he needs anything to come wake me up. I woke up a little while later and decided to grab a few THC gummies. I opened the cabinet to find it ravaged. There should have been 20 gummies, 4 cookies, and 8 brownies, but there was only 15 gummies, 1 cookie, and 6 brownies. I then heard sobbing from the bathroom. I walked in to see my sibling in an empty bathtub, crying. There was throw up in and around the toilet. He was clearly impaired, and he didn\u2019t know what was going on or what to do. \n\nI called mom and asked her what to do. She was there in like 30 seconds, and she rushed my sibling to the ER. He is completely fine now. I don\u2019t know what happened between her and the doctor, but she told me I\u2019m not in trouble. She said I will be if I don\u2019t pay the ER bill, which is something like 5500 dollars. I said hell no, if anything, she should give me money for the weed. She said she would sue me, and I said I would never be her free baby sitter if she tried. I said she needs to be more responsible, and told her that if she isn\u2019t, my siblings will get hurt. \n\nI said if she sues me, I will cut out my entire family. Now people are calling me the asshole, and they\u2019re threatening legal stuff, none of which I know or am prepared for. I think my mom was in the wrong, but I thought back to my baby sibling crying in the bathtub. AITA?

You can't trust her.\n\nYou didn't do anything wrong. You were sleeping in your own home with your CBD products in a locked cabinet. She came in without your permission and left her child unsupervised in your house without your knowledge. She unlocked a cabinet that she knew contained CBD products that you had purchased legally. This situation is 100% her fault. If she gets charges for child neglect, she deserves them. \n\nHonestly, your mom is a hot mess. You're better off distancing yourself from her and any other family members who support her nonsense.", "NTA. She brought children into your home while you were asleep, unlocked a cabinet that she knew had weed products in it, and left and is now blaming you for what happened?

She dropped them off unannounced while you were asleep and gave them access to the edibles herself. If she tries to sue you you can counter her by threatening child protective services for her abandoning her children and giving them access to a \"controlled substance\". \n\nYou clearly told her which cabinet was off limits and she UNLOCKED it which makes this whole situation her own fault.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I'd call CPS and notify them that your mother unlocked the cabinet containing your products to give access to your minor siblings without your knowledge or consent, told them they \"could only eat the snacks in the cabinet \" and it resulted in a trip to the emergency room. You were the responsible adult by keeping the product locked up and your mom sabotaged the line of safety you provided for the children. This is criminal behavior. And then she has the audacity to ask you to pay for the medical expenses that she wouldn't have if she'd left the cupboard locked? Unreal!", "CPS would love to hear the tale, I'm sure. She's in no position to threaten anything.", "NTA.\n\nShe owes you for the consumed goods and should also not have access to your home..She was both irresponsible and frankly endangering the siblings doing that.\n\nAnd could cause you legal liability for allowing minors access to drugs.", "Marked NSFW in case this situation is triggering for anyone who may come across it", "First off, NTA.\n\nYou need a lawyer like, yesterday though. Your mom is going to spin this and you need damage control. And babysitting is over no matter what. You have to show you did not approve of this abuse of the key privilege. Probably are going to lose some family too because... well I know how this is going to go. Probably LC/NC with your mom.   \n\n\nFirst things first talk to a lawyer NOW. They'll have the best advice for the area. There's a chance if you're in the wrong area that you're screwed... but no matter what you cannot have your mom in your apartment ever after this.", "NTA.\n\nShe unlocked the cabinet and gave your sibling permission to eat all they wanted. That is 100% on her.\n\nI would tell her to go ahead and sue if she wants.  She won't win a dime, and in fact I will bet you she won't be able to get a lawyer to take the case unless she lies to them.", "NTA but you should def have a better lock on that cabinet one that your mom can't get into. Legally you are responsible though as it was your house and your gummies.", "NTA, you owe your mom nothing, but I would suggest that given your mom's irresponsibility, you change the locks and don't give her access to where you live.  She will be unable to drop off your siblings unless it's at an agreed upon time, and you'll be awake to supervise.  Also, get a much better lock for your CBD products and do not, under any circumstances, give your mom the key.  Finally, do not babysit when you don't want to; it's not your responsibility.", "NTA. It's a shame what happened to your sibling, & I'm glad they're all right, but it *wouldn't* have happened if your mother hadn't dumped them off at your house while you were sleeping off an illness, broken into a locked cabinet she was specifically told not to touch & *WHY* not to touch it, & told your sibling to help themselves.", "NTA. You had a locked cabinet and had already explained that to your mother that it wasn't \"food\". If anything you could report her to the cops for purposefully giving children drugs", "Jesus, this is awful all around. Just a horrible confluence of circumstances. NTA for sure, your mom should never have unlocked it knowing. \n\nI'm not against CBD and I eat gummies on the regular so no judgement there. Only suggestion is not to mix The edibles in? \n\nMore to the point, you're young and just experimenting a little, nothing bad. Plus you're getting the responsibility of your siblings. Just stay safe and draw boundaries. If it's too much, it's too much.", "NTA...your mom knowingly gave your sibling access to weed, in spite of your warnings. This is on her. Stop watching your siblings now and don't let your mom have access to your home.", "Who said the kid was hallucinating? CBD can cause paranoia, disorientation, and even physical illness.

Best defense is a good offense. Get your story heard first. And since she has threatened you, I\u2019d go ahead and turn her in first.", "Please change your locks. \n\n\nLet mom know she needs to make other permanent arrangements for childcare. \n\n\nDo not engage or respond to any calls/texts/emails/social media messages about this with *anyone.*\n\n\nConsult for free with an attorney about what happened, just to get some perspective and be able to say you did if you need that later on.", "Make sure to screenshot ALL of the text conversations, if you don't have any of those, then you need to write down as much of the conversation as you can recall, including date/time stamps.", "Not if her mother didn't have permission to enter the OP was asleep.", "No he's not legally responsible his mother left the kids and unlocked the cabinet herself without letting OP know.", "I'm not so sure about that if Mother unlocked a locked container. IANAL, but there's precedent with other things that the Mother would be on the hook. OP had a reasonable expectation that the cabinet would be secure. OP needs a lawyer like yesterday, either way", "needs to change the house locks so mum cant just enter and dop her kids off whilst they are a sleep", "The fact she had to break into the locked cabinet and told the kids to eat them proves more its the moms fault. Also who TF leaves kids in someones house while they are sleeping? So much negligence on the mom.", "Don't warn her ahead of time. She doesn't need time to coach your siblings to flip the script."]}
