This job pays $28 an hour so this was HUGE for us. The problem is that it's overnight shifts so we needed a sitter for the kids. We asked MIL to do so, she said yes and we told her to pick what she felt was a fair amount for payment. She said $300 on the 3 day weeks and $400 on the 4 day weeks. (12hr shifts)\n\nI will admit I was a bit thrown off with that price ONLY because she didn't get here until after the kids (all over 12) were already sleeping and left before they woke up so all she did was use our hot water, eat all our food and sleep. I didn't say anything because it's really long hours and we needed someone. It turned to shit quick. Every work day we get out at 5:30 and have an hr drive home. She is blowing up our phones by 5:50-6am asking where we are and telling us to hurry up. We get home to filth, created by her because my kids are sleeping the whole time (like garbage beside the chair/sofa where she sleeps, dirty dishes everywhere), dog shit (apparently she wasn't bringing the dog out) and found she's been letting the dog sleep on our bed (absolute big no-no), as well as feeding our dog table scraps (I only know this because she all the sudden begs constantly when she didn't before).\n\nBetween me trying to manage this new sleeping schedule and me having to un-do everything she did while here, I decided I couldn't do it. This was following her calling us out of work twice because her back hurt and she wanted to go home. So, I spoke to my husband and told him I wasn't paying her to watch our kids anymore because she's creating more problems than she's worth and that he needed to \"let her go\". He agreed but he didn't want to hurt her feelings, so I told him I could do it. He decided it would be better if we both did so we called her on speaker and told her this wasn't working out. When she asked why, we were pretty blunt in our reasoning. She trashes the house, she eats everything in sight (even stuff we said don't touch), she doesn't follow our rules about the dog and she cost us almost $1300 for having us leave work within an hour of being there because of her back. She starts yelling and saying she quit her job to do this (we had no idea she quit or WHY considering she didn't work the days we did) and that we were heartless because this was her only income now. My husband was visibly uncomfortable but we stood out ground. He is feeling some type of way because now he's questioning whether or not she was causing **that many** issues. He isn't seeing it the way I do however because he's not the one who deals with all the problems, I am. I do the grocery shopping and have had to go several times more than I usually do after not sleeping. I'm the one who cleans (he does other chores). AITA?

Idk what to do cuz on one hand I want more money but on the other hand I don't want to put the kiddo in daycare due to the way the world is now a days.\n\nEdit to put in NTA", "NTA. \n\nI'm sorry that didn't work out", "OP=NTA\n\nIf the kids weren't making the mess but she was--then she needed to be cleaning up HER MESS.  Plus per your comments, she knew the rule on foods and letting dog out.  That she did none of these--Unacceptable.", "By her story, her tween children are asleep by 5-6pm, so sure she might just be a racoon in this poorly thought out piece of fiction.", "That honestly heavily depends on many factors. OP's new sitter is her younger sister and its working out very well apparently.", "She does not say her kids are asleep by 5-6 pm?", "Nowhere does it say 5-6 pm. Op says they don't get off work til 5:30 am and it takes them an hour to get home. MIL blows their phones up between 5:50-6 am. But taking into account they work overnight they probably aren't going in til way later at night and not 6 pm.", "So I think this is a bot. Poorly made too. Copied half a comment from the person directly under my comment.", "Awh I love me a good sisterly relationship \ud83e\udd70", "Awesome sister!", "And.... they are asleep at 6pm?  Something is off here....  You work 12 hour shifts, leave work at 5:30 am, you say they are asleep when she arrives, and that they \"legally\" can't be left alone.", "I'm calling BS on this whole thing, she claims they are asleep when MIL arrives.  On what planet are 12/13 year olds asleep before 6pm?", "[removed]", "This reply was stolen from u/spicyhooligan.  Downvote and report!", "They were out having sex in a hotel room lmao", "It doesn't say MIL is there for 12 hours, that's the length of their shifts.  Kids are probably responsible for getting themselves ready for bed before MIL arrives to stay overnight with them.", "Youngest is 12 so oldest is probably 14-16. Totally fine to leave them home alone overnight if you have a security system and phones.", "You need to actually look up your state law and not go by what others have told you.", "What state? Reddit can help look at laws for you I\u2019m sure.", "This comment is stolen from u/substanxcnj", "Where does it even say they have 12 hour shifts?", "The smoke from a house fire can kill in a minute or less. 16 year old may be just about acceptable, but would you trust a panicking half-asleep 12 year old to be able to get themselves out of a smoke filled house? It doesn't sit well with me.\n\nedit: I see the kids with no life experience and no knowledge of the dangers of fire are downvoting while providing no counterpoint, lol.", "According to that chart in Texas any age is fine o.O yet we have a law that under 7 can not be left unattended in a motor vehicle for more than 5 minutes (found this out when my mother got onto me for leaving my 5 yo who is perfectly capable of unbuckling her 5pt carseat in the car in full view of the cash register to get her a bottle of water + snack for a trip in a fully locked vehicle)  \n\n\nI would never leave my 5yo unattended at home despite the fact she is completely self reliant and responsible (I think they list it as \"maturity\" on that chart.)", "Which was stolen from u/spicyhooligan!  Downvote the stolen comments and report!", "In the original, top paragraph: \"She said $300 on the 3 day weeks and $400 on the 4 day weeks.

Your expectations are pretty out of whack if you think you were overpaying her to just be there.\n\nIf you want more than just being there, gotta pay for more. One dollar above minimum wage is not enough to point out that you're paying \"above minimum wage.\" Barely.\n\nYTA for your crazy expectations.", "NTA. I\u2019ll admit, $100 a night is a bit low for the time put in, but it\u2019s a family member doing it and the kids are sleeping for most of it. You\u2019re basically just paying someone to sit/sleep in your house and be available when/if your kids need something. It honestly sounds like a sweet gig. Not saying Id wanna do it for a stranger but if my sibling wanted me to do that, it doesnt sound like the worst gig. Except your MIL couldn\u2019t handle  just not being actively terrible. Its not that hard to clean up after yourself. If she couldn\u2019t even maintain the house with only her, I wouldn\u2019t trust her being able to handle dealing with your kids in the event they needed something.", "Nta", "Does MIL really think she was doing a good job by leaving your home trashed? I mean honestly... Would she pay someone to do to her home what she was doing to yours?\n\nNTA", "NTA. I think a honey badger would create less problems than her", "You are right to let her go if it's not working out. And no one would want to pay someone unreliable who transhes the house and disrespects basic rules. NTA", "nta", "NTA. Your MIL seems gross and disrespectful.", "NTA  \nShe was causing more problems than she was worth. The kids are all over 12. Why do you need a sitter if they are already asleep when you leave?", "NTA, and it has nothing to do with her wage, but rather her inability to do it properly.", "I mean, YTA for having an elderly woman babysit for you overnight and expecting her to sleep on a couch or chair. It would definitely be reasonable to ask that she cleans up after herself but this is where she sleeps literally half the time, you gotta provide a bed! Also, the price is very reasonable, it's like 8 dollars per hour so barely minimum wage.

OP is fine firing her if they're not happy with what she's doing, but you have to pay people reasonable hourly pay even if your kids are asleep.

She said her MIL wasn't getting there until after the kids were asleep, so she's saying they're asleep by 5:30 PM, which is very unlikely to be true.", "Seriously, $100 a night when your only job responsibilities are watch tv, play video games, browse Reddit, and go to sleep? Not a bad gig; the only downsides are the constraint on your time and the comfort of the sleeping arrangements. If those are not burdensome it\u2019s a pretty sweet deal.", "The vast majority of people, and all the decent parents, would have someone stay with their children overnight. 14 is too young to be responsible for 2 other children and a house for such a long period of time with parents an hour away during a time when all neighbors and other contacts are sleeping. It doesn't matter if they're all asleep.", "12 hour shifts with an hour plus drive on either end. Very confusing they\u2019d be asleep already", "Children can be alone for a couple hours.", "My bad. But still it says the MIL wouldn't get there til well after the kids went to bed. So theoretically they could be on their own for a few hours before she gets there.
