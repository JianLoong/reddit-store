This job pays $28 an hour so this was HUGE for us. The problem is that it's overnight shifts so we needed a sitter for the kids. We asked MIL to do so, she said yes and we told her to pick what she felt was a fair amount for payment. She said $300 on the 3 day weeks and $400 on the 4 day weeks. (12hr shifts)\n\nI will admit I was a bit thrown off with that price ONLY because she didn't get here until after the kids (all over 12) were already sleeping and left before they woke up so all she did was use our hot water, eat all our food and sleep. I didn't say anything because it's really long hours and we needed someone. It turned to shit quick. Every work day we get out at 5:30 and have an hr drive home. She is blowing up our phones by 5:50-6am asking where we are and telling us to hurry up. We get home to filth, created by her because my kids are sleeping the whole time (like garbage beside the chair/sofa where she sleeps, dirty dishes everywhere), dog shit (apparently she wasn't bringing the dog out) and found she's been letting the dog sleep on our bed (absolute big no-no), as well as feeding our dog table scraps (I only know this because she all the sudden begs constantly when she didn't before).\n\nBetween me trying to manage this new sleeping schedule and me having to un-do everything she did while here, I decided I couldn't do it. This was following her calling us out of work twice because her back hurt and she wanted to go home. So, I spoke to my husband and told him I wasn't paying her to watch our kids anymore because she's creating more problems than she's worth and that he needed to \"let her go\". He agreed but he didn't want to hurt her feelings, so I told him I could do it. He decided it would be better if we both did so we called her on speaker and told her this wasn't working out. When she asked why, we were pretty blunt in our reasoning. She trashes the house, she eats everything in sight (even stuff we said don't touch), she doesn't follow our rules about the dog and she cost us almost $1300 for having us leave work within an hour of being there because of her back. She starts yelling and saying she quit her job to do this (we had no idea she quit or WHY considering she didn't work the days we did) and that we were heartless because this was her only income now. My husband was visibly uncomfortable but we stood out ground. He is feeling some type of way because now he's questioning whether or not she was causing **that many** issues. He isn't seeing it the way I do however because he's not the one who deals with all the problems, I am. I do the grocery shopping and have had to go several times more than I usually do after not sleeping. I'm the one who cleans (he does other chores). AITA? He feels terrible, I do not.\n\nETA: minimum wage where I am is $7.25 an hour; For those very few individuals who think that what I was paying her wasn't enough (it's above minimum wage).", "created_utc": 1680526643, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12ajnbg/aita_for_firing_my_mil/", "score": 28, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I think the price was throwing me off with MIL because of how much damage she was causing. Such a relief honestly.", "See, after we fired her I hired on my younger sister and that's how things are now. I pay her the same amount I paid MIL but I've been throwing in little bonuses and even buying her special snacks and stuff that I know she likes because I come home to a peaceful atmosphere. She even cleaned out my fridge the other day because she was bored. Of course my sister says I'm \"doing too much\" (she didn't even want to get paid) but holy hell is she worth it.", "My oldest is 14. My twins turn 13 in a couple months.", "Yes, absolutely. We even put a \"do not eat\" list on the fridge (which she ignores), laid out the bathroom schedule for the dog (all she has to do is open the door as we live on a farm with a giant fence), let her know the exact time frame of when we would be back, etc etc. She just completely went against everything. We don't even allow eating in the living room due to a recent ant problem and she knows that but does so anyways and then leaves her garbage out.", "With the damage she's causing, absolutely right.  Glad your sister can help.\n\nAs for long term solutions, with both of you working nights, this will be a difficult problem to solve.  What happens when you sister has kids or goes on vacation, or, or, etc.\n\nGood luck!", "You do realize that $100/12 hours is about $8.33/hr.

But to me $100 a night for watching 3 kids that can basically take care of themselves is a lot.\n\nNTA", "With this information I would say NTA. If she knew what the expectations were before hand and she still chose to completely go against your wishes in your home. The way I would think about it is if she wasn't your MIL would you even hesitate to fire her. It isn't your fault she chose to quit her day job and do so poorly at this one. You are paying 100 dollars a day for her to babysit and she isn't even doing 20 dollars worth of work. If your husband is getting cold feet about firing her it is because his emotions are getting in the way of the decision.", "She has a baby and she brings her with her. She's a SAHM and currently doesn't have her license so as of right now things are okay but when the time comes and she has more socially involved things to do, we will work around it for sure.", "It's overnight though...like most of that you'd be getting paid to sleep. That is a super nice supplement to a day job.", "Minimum wage where I am is $7.25 an hour.", "The children are sleeping\nThe only work is keeping the house clean and have a snack", "Where I'm from there is a law in place that children under 16 aren't allowed to stay home alone without an adult present.", "Yeah I definitely had a lot of reservations about it. The only issue is that by my state law, the kids aren't allowed to stay home unattended until they are 16. I personally think they are more than capable but unfortunately the state does not think so. Not much I can do about that, lol.", "Nice.  Should be stable for a while, at least.  Good luck, still NTA.  Glad you and husband were on the same page (mostly) and he had your back.  That can get sticky, otherwise.  Be ready to step in if he backslides and wants her to baby sit again.", "Yeah that's the federal minimum wage. And it's not a livable wage either.", "Listen, I understand that you have your own opinion on that but it is liveable in my state depending on what you need. My MIL lives in a one bedroom house that she owns outright. Her bills equate to $400 a month, for everything, and she gets food stamps. She was getting well over the amount she needed to survive. Us on the other hand (needing a 5 bedroom home and currently renting) need much more than that- as rent for a 5 bedroom is $1600+ and $7.25 was absolutely not enough. \n\nFor added context on the issue at hand, I now pay my sister that same amount (whom lives with my mother) and she has already saved enough to put a down payment on her own rental, which is only $625 a month for a 2 bedroom. So even with her rent, she's still able to save a significant amount of money. I agree $7.25 isn't liveable for most people- myself included. But for some people it is enough.", "You might have a point if sis had to actually do any work, but she doesn't, and she doesn't need to live on the wage. She's literally getting paid to eat, chill, and sleep like she would at home.", "And I would agree with you on that, it's definitely not a lot of work. and I'm not commenting that they aren't paying enough, more pointing out that them thinking it's too much money given how much child care costs nowadays."]}
