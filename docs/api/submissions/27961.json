UPDATE", "selftext": "\n\nThe new school year starts tomorrow and we've just been notified that this teacher will not be returning for the new school year. The email we received claimed she has 'decided to move onto new opportunities'. However, me and my wife have had a talk with some other parents and unsurprisingly that is not the case. Apparently my son was not the first or last student she has done this to. This teacher is notorious for never letting anyone leave her classroom for anything unless she can physically see something wrong with them, even then there has been a few instances when she's told students having things like eczema flare ups to wait until the end of class. She even tried to do the same thing to my son when he was having another episode, luckily since the last incident he's learned to ignore her, and him and his friend went down to the nurse despite what she said. \n\nAt the beginning of summer, my wife got a call from one of the other mothers, who explained that the teacher had tried to the same thing to her daughter, as it turns out she had a friend on the school board and is very well liked by all parents and staff. She arranged a meeting with the teacher, the principal, the school board and the superintendent to discuss this teacher's behavior, before the meeting she spent ages compiling evidence against this teacher. She managed to get the medical forms of the students she'd denied access to the nurse to (with permission from the parents of course), she somehow got all the reports of her behavior towards students, she got statements from students, parents and other members of staff. She even got a couple students who had more serious incidents to come to the meeting with their parents and recount what had happened, we couldn't be there since we were going on holiday (vacation) but both my son and his friend filmed them telling what happened and we it to the mother to play at the meeting. When it finally came time for the meeting the teacher had not anticipated that the mother would be so prepared, and after an hour in the meeting, the teacher was finally fired after 6 years of mistreating students. \n\nIf you're wondering how she kept her job so long, I was too, turns out she was a nepo hire, the principal is her uncle. \n\nFor all those wondering how my son is doing, he's doing a bit better, though his episodes have been happening more frequently as of late. Thank you all for the advice and well wished on the original post, salt does seem to help sometimes.", "created_utc": 1696106916, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16whgdq/aita_for_yelling_at_my_sons_teacher_and_making/", "score": 302, "replies": ["better keep an eye on that principle, see he doesnt try anything.", "#[Original Post Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14w06da/aita_for_yelling_at_my_sons_teacher_and_making/)", "Thank the heavens for that Mom being so prepared and I think I might just send an email with the documents to the Associate Superintendent or next level up from Principal. The Principal knows she mistreats students and needs to lose his job and admin certification\n\nThis could've been a huge lawsuit", "The principal should be fired too. I'd work with that mom to get that in motion.", "That principal should be fired too", "Great!", "Wow, what an update! I'm glad that your son will not have to deal with that teacher anymore. How sad that it even occurred in the first place though. It's good that he has supportive friends and parents around him that encourage him to take care of himself and stand up for his needs. Thank you for he update!", "Nepo Hire\u2026I\u2019m in the UK, never heard that term\u2026 going to use it forever now. \nGlad your son is cool x", "An eczema flare up isn\u2019t a reason to leave class. Clearly there may be something else going on here, but that shouldn\u2019t be it.", "More teachers will be quitting. Soon no one will want to teach.", "[deleted]", "This is appalling. I am glad your son is ok. \n\nWhile I am glad that there was no permanent damage done,  firing the teacher 6 years after this troubling behavior started is problematic. The Principal and leadership failed to act making them complicit. \n\nHave you considered scheduling a consult with an attorney well versed in education law? If not you should. Your son was failed at so many points and this should not be tolerated. \n\nAccountability needs to happen because no other child needs to attend a school with a Principal who has shown that he does not prioritize the safety and well being of students. Further if the school nurse was aware that your son or other similarly situated students requested to be excused for a medical reason and failed to report it to leadership then they also need to be held accountable.", "Thank you.", "Unsurprising - I imagine royalty's not too fond of that kind of terminology. :D", "Are you kidding? The itchiness and pain could be distracting beyond measure and impede learning for both the sufferer and their companions, and if they needed to apply topical medicines on a part of their body not accessible without disrobing, of course they would need to excuse themselves from the classroom. Not to mention that some places require medications for students be held for them by nurses or other appropriately qualified staff, rather than by the kids themselves. What a ridiculous statement.", "Because they have to be mindful of kids' medical conditions? This has been standard for decades.", "https://reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/s/T9v0nZI4qf", "You do realize it's an update post, right?", "I don\u2019t know where this particular OP is from, but if there is a union involved it can be very difficult to get rid of inept teachers. I went through something my first year of teaching with a teacher who shouldn\u2019t have been teaching but the process to get rid of her was so difficult due to our union. Unfortunately while it can help immensely, it can also be a huge hinderance when people are not deserving of being protected", "why did you reply to me? lol", "I agree. My kid got so itchy she scratched until she bled. The school called me because she needed her prescription strength cream and we hadn't sent it in (she hadn't had a bad flare up in awhile). No way could she have dealt with that in class", "As a lifelong eczema sufferer, nah. Creams go on twice a day max, usually when you are already naked. You can keep lotion in your desk for dry hands and such. Never in a million years did I bring medicated creams to school as a kid.", "Because I agree with your comment. The Principal is definitely one to keep an eye on or better yet be fired."]}
