This happened last week at my cousin's 'Jack' birthday dinner. I live in another city about a two-hour drive from my hometown. I decided to take my good friend 'Tom' with me for the party and my cousin said it's no problem. Tom and Jack know each other pretty well. Tom is openly bisexual. Some people in my family have openly voiced their concern about Tom being a 'bad influence' on us due to his bisexuality, which I find disgusting, to be honest.\r\n\r\nOver dinner, Jack announced that he had proposed to his gf and she said yes. Everyone cheered. I congratulated him and felt genuinely happy for him. Everyone used to tease me and Jack a lot for years for being single. I have perfected an ability to completely ignore them when they ask me questions about my personal life. But last night after Jack's announcement, my oldest cousin 'Peter' decided that it was the right time to mock me again.\r\n\r\nPeter is the only son of my mother's oldest rich sister. He's a manipulative bully who always gets his way because his parents have been spoiling him rotten all his life. His wife dumped him last Christmas when she found out he had been cheating on her with his co-worker.\r\n\r\nAt one point during the night, Jack playfully asked me \"(My name), why are you still single? Aren't there any girls here pretty enough for you? Don't be so picky, dude!\"\r\n\r\nI just rolled my eyes at him.\r\n\r\nAnd then Peter decided to chime in. He said \"Well that's the problem. He's not interested in pretty girls. He's interested in pretty boys.\" while throwing a sideways glance at Tom, whose face immediately turned red.\r\n\r\nEveryone was now turning their gaze at Tom so Jack tried to fix the awkward situation by redirecting the attention back to me, which I didn't mind. He said \"Oh, no. He likes girls, alright. Trust me. I've seen him getting really wild with girls at parties before. This one's a maniac.\"\r\n\r\nAnd rather than leave it at that, Peter decided to double down, saying \"Yeah but maybe he's changed his mind. Who knows, after spending years in the city hanging out with those hom*s, maybe now he likes boys too.\"\r\n\r\nThat's when I decided I'd had enough.\r\n\r\nI said \"Even if I were gay, that's none of your business. Why are you so obsessed with my dick and what I do with it anyway? I didn't go out of my way to say anything to you when you used yours to cheat on your wife twice, did I? Because that's none of my business.\"\r\n\r\nThings escalated quickly from there. Peter, his kids, and his parents left immediately. I half-dragged Tom out of there because he was already telling everyone how sorry he was and that he shouldn't have come.\r\n\r\nNow Peter and my aunt demand I apologize to them for bringing up Peter's infidelity at dinner and humiliating and hurting them, especially his son and daughter. Now the kids know he's the reason why he and their mom separated and they are extremely upset and are giving him the silent treatment.
