I asked her on her due date if she still didn\u2019t want me to be there and she said she wasn\u2019t sure. She was very stressed during labor and I could tell she was really anxious so I did my best to comfort her and didn\u2019t ask. She did ask me to leave when it was time to push and I came back when our daughter was born. I didn\u2019t catch her, but I got to cut the cord and I held her first, which I am very grateful for. \n\nThings were okay with my wife for a while until she dismissed how I felt about missing the birth and said I was making a big deal out of a couple minutes. I then found out the reason she excluded me was because she was scared I would stop being attracted to her. I kinda lost it and I regret it, but I was sleep deprived and told her that I was disappointed in her as a mother and she put her vanity before our kid and before me. My wife then asked for marriage counselling, we\u2019re on a wait list for a first appointment. We\u2019ve been very cold towards one another when we\u2019re alone and we will probably fight soon again. \n\nI know it\u2019s not the best way to be when we have a newborn but I can\u2019t help but blame her for this situation. I will be going back to work soon so I\u2019m hoping the distance work gives me from her will help me calm down and gather the strength to be more mature about it all. \n\nUpdate 2 : 1/10/2023\n\nWife and I separated for a couple months but decided to work on our marriage. Bigger issues rose to the surface in marriage counselling and wife did apologise for keeping me out of the delivery room, although she affirmed in the same sentence that if we have a second child, she\u2019d ask me to stay outside again. She just will not trust me to not loose attraction to her.  I had never realised just how deeply insecure she is about her looks and how it affects every part of her daily life. She\u2019s a pretty woman and she always acted very confident but it was mostly a facade that completely crumbled with the pregnancy. We ran into some issues with breastfeeding related to that where she would eat very little to lose the pregnancy weight and it caused her to produce less milk, consequently stressing her and the baby out more. I begged her to postpone her diet until our baby is a little older but it was so important for her to lose weight first. I tried supporting her but I was going through my own struggles and I couldn\u2019t understand how she could put that over the health of our baby. \n\nWe\u2019re determined to make our marriage work and I\u2019m going to do my best to understand her struggles with self image. I\u2019ve come to accept that seeing the birth of any child I have with her will not be possible.", "created_utc": 1673616431, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10auiu8/update_aita_for_being_hurt_my_wife_wont_let_me/", "score": 4292, "replies": ["[Original post for your Friday coffee break](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/vf7ksv/aita_for_being_hurt_that_my_wife_wont_allow_me_to/)", "I hope therapy helps your wife - she's clearly really struggling with her self esteem and mental health. Hopefully any PPD will be picked up on.\n\nI understand it's hard for you, but keep trying to see it from her perspective if you can. I think you're doing the right things. Pregnancy and childbirth isn't always a positive experience for a lot of women.", "This absolutely indicates a mental health issue, and I hope you're pushing your wife to get personal counseling as well as the marital counseling.  If she's serious about keeping the marriage together, then you need to explain her phobia about you losing attraction to her based on looks is actually ruining your attraction to her based on her outlook.  A marital therapist cannot help this other than acknowledging the impact it is having on your marriage.    \n\nYour wife can't explain these feelings because they aren't rational and, on some level, she may know that, but that doesn't make it easier to get past.  She's essentially dealing with a form of body dysmorphia, like those anorexic people who are nothing but bones but still think they are fat.", "You know what formula is, right ? Why does she have to breastfeed ?", "Look only one person has any right to decide who is in the hospital room during their medical procedure and that\u2019s the person having the procedure - your wife.", "In short, she got her way and will get it every time\n.", "This is a tough one. Diet culture is a disease and you're married to a long-term case. \n\nTry this one on for size. What if you replace \"attractiveness\" and \"vanity\" and \"how attractive she is\" with \"her control over her body\"?  She didn't want you in the room for the birth because she wanted to retain a sliver of control over her body and how it's seen. She doesn't want to eat enough to breastfeed easily because she wants to regain control over how her body is shaped. Does that give you a little more insight?\n\nA lot of times in pregnancy and birth and feeding, the pregnant person needs *some* kind of control over a process that often seems to happen without their input -- and this is in loving families with wanted pregnancies! Very few people get pregnant and then have it go exactly how they wanted, expected and hoped. No amount of dieting, exercise or anything else will change what a pregnancy does to a body. And if her pride is in how she looks and the control she has over how she looks, going through a year or more in which that entire foundation crumbles has to be really rough. \n\nNAH. I think you're both victims of an image-obsessed culture that neither of you will ever fully unlearn. Good luck in the times ahead - old age comes for us all.", "I find it completely odd that wife is made into vain evil partner because she wanted to push alone. On one hand, I get why you want to be there, on the other, when it comes to who is in room while going birth and pushing, she should really be entitle to ask for lonely comfort if she needs that without being willified.\n\nYou got to cut the cord and hold baby as first and that is just not enough.", "Honestly, OP, keep in the back of your mind that your child can always become a victim of her physical insecurity. You had a daughter, and as a daughter, be prepared to keep your eyes and ears open\n\nMy mum didn't exactly push me to anorexia or anything, but her comments on my weight growing up were very painful and damaging. It took me a very long time to work through it and even forgive her", "  Do you know if she's experiencing any postpartum depression?", "Wife is not the AH. She probably heard stories of men being creeped out and losing interest in the wife for a while.\n\nA friend of mine witnessed a C-section and was totally freaked out by seeing the layers being cut and seeing the \"inside\" of his wife. They had a dead bedroom for some six months until he got over that.\n\nLook, I'm a woman. Once I saw a video of a birth, with the baby crowning, and was absolutely TERRIFIED! So probably wife didn't want to be seen in that state and you should respect her.", "Listen, men contribute with al\u00e9m and loving support during pregnancy. Women deal with pain, discomfort, a changed body forever, breastfeeding... So give her a break and respect her wishes of all times during BIRTH.", "Sorry but her dieting is neglect, she needs to see a professional because her self esteem issues are hurting your baby", "I will probably get blasted but personally I think You Are TA.\n\nIt is not silly she feels as she does. I have 3 kids. I was in the delivery room for the first one but I was there for my wife and I have seen enough births during nursing school that there is nothing magical to it in my opinion nor is cutting the cord. Being in the room should be completely focused on your wife not catching a baby.\n\nShe has ALWAYS felt as she does about her looks. I think we all have feelings like that and you dismissing that and getting mad was not the best way to go about it. You were tired, you apologized but what is more important? Watching a baby being born or making sure your ENTIRE family is happy and healthy. Support your wife. If she wants to diet just advise her you would prefer her to wait but since it is affecting milk production then advise you would need to supplement formula.\n\nYou need to get yourself into the right mind to make sure her feelings and her and your babies health are whats important not being in the room. I could not be in the room for our second because my 1st daughter was only 2 1/2 and I was lucky I was able to be in the room before they took her in for her c-section. Same with the 3rd. I have to watch 1 and 2 and my wife was not upset by it and all kids are fine.", "[removed]", "Why couldn't you be in the room but just not \"down there\" to watch the baby born? My friend felt similarly to your wife and her husband agreed to stay waist up for the birth. She was afraid he'd be turned off of her sexually after seeing that so he agreed not to watch.", "Tell her that you are less and less attracted to her because of her attitude. That it really dimmed her light in your eyes.", "Pretty or not your wife sounds ugly. Probably struggles with self image because of her vane personality.", "Definitely wouldn\u2019t be having anymore children with her.", "Thanks for the update OP.\n\nSadly, nothing seems resolved and has actually gotten worse imo.  I will say it again to you.  There are very few hallmark moments in a mans life, i.e. graduation, engagement, exchanging marriage vows, witnessing the birth of your chikd(ren) (ESPECIALLY your first born), kids graduations, grandchildren, etc.  To be robbed of a hallmark experience like being there for the birth of your child and then be told youll be robbed again (and again), is a bitter bitter pill that I dont think I could swallow.\n\nEvery single father that I personally know was in the room for the birth of their child(ren).  In fact, had they not been, they would have been in very serious trouble (that includes me....my wife would have been absolutely furious).  Every husband and father I know holds those memories close.  Just food for thought.\n\nYou have a serious decision to make sir.  If you kowtow to this, whats next?  This will drive a massive wedge between you for the rest of your marriage since she has said that this is a hill she is willing to die on.\n\nGood luck.", "NTA. There are two ways this could have been handled by you. 1. You say I don't like it but accept it begrudgingly. (This you did), causing stress for mother and baby. 2. Pretend everything is OK, but when the the topic inevitably comes up later, you cause upset through regret by being honest and saying 'we're meant to be a team. I'm distraught over your choice and it's too late to fix it.'\n\nWordings can vary but these are the two choices. It sounds like there's a mental health issue bubbling up she needs to resolve sooner rather than later.", "Don't have any more child with her yet..not until you iron it all out.  She has issues.  She is breastfeeding to lose the weight", "OP, I have to ask, is your marriage really worth saving?\n\nSeems pretty one sided if you ask me. I think you deserve better than that.", "Your wife sounds like a real piece of work lol. She doesn\u2019t sound mature enough to be a mother and I feel sorry for you child.", "Wtf did I just read?? The wife doesn't care of the baby doesn't get milk because she wants to be skinny right away? And OP is trying to keep the relationship with this person.... why?", "Can\u2019t they put up that little curtain so you don\u2019t see? I kind of get it. There\u2019s blood sometimes urine and even stools when you are pushing. It\u2019s not pretty .", "She wanted to breastfeed.", "Wtf? If she doesn\u2019t want someone to stare at her vagina as it tears and bleeds and pushes out a fucking human then that\u2019s completely fine. NO ONE not even your partner is entitled to doing whatever they want with your body and that includes staring at it when you are most vulnerable.\n\nImagine you were trying to take a dump and you\u2019re straining and bleeding and had a prolapsed anus and are crying and sweating and your wife demands that she stare at your asshole while you do it. \nI\u2019m guessing you would not enjoy that. But too bad, you have to let her watch because she made that dinner with you and her feelings will be hurt if you don\u2019t let her gawk.", "She did, and I\u2019m still working through my resentment but it is what it is.", "She\u2019s not evil, this is an exaggeration by reddit and I don\u2019t think she did it to hurt me or exclude me intentionally. I was hurt by the lack of trust in me and since the birth I\u2019ve seen her and helped in very unflattering situations so to learn that she thinks birth will traumatise me was just a huge blow for me. It broke the way I saw our marriage and it just hurt. I know it would have been best if I just sucked it up and pretended it was fine, but I couldn\u2019t.", "And I did. It broke our marriage though.", "Read the complete post please.", "Yeah since when is it the father's default right to be present in the delivery room??? The person giving birth is whose well being matters the most here.\n\n\"Put her vanity before the baby's welfare\" - please. I'm pretty sure the baby couldn't care less about who stands where, while it's being pressed out of it's mother's womb.", "No idea, she didn\u2019t have an answer for that!", "She knows, we\u2019ve had this conversation in counselling but it doesn\u2019t seem to change her mind.", "So telling her she should be insecure for her insecurities is the way to fix this? \n\nLike yes obviously it\u2019s a shitty situation for OP, but insecurities are real and difficult to turn off. Being cruel isn\u2019t going to help", "I think it is to me. I am very hurt by her actions and I disapprove of her choices but I don\u2019t think she wanted to hurt me at all. There\u2019s still a lot of good things I love about her, it\u2019s just harder to let go of the bad things I\u2019ve discovered.", "If she is determined to breastfeed then she needs to put the dieting off if it affects the feeding.

Long road ahead, buckle up !", "TBH are you okay with that kind of manipulation?\n\nI know I\u2019ll get a lot of flack for this because a woman pushes the baby out so they choose who they want in the room, but I also think with that logic - at the end of the day it\u2019s sad for the father of the child who wants to be there to not be allowed.\n\nPS I am a woman, I personally couldn\u2019t imagine giving birth without the father of the child in the room. It\u2019s not just my special moment, it\u2019s his as well.", "She must be really pretty for you to still try to work this out.", "You sound very egotistic. You say you snapped because you were sleep deprived. Well, she was having contractions, do you know how it hurts? You cut the chord, isn't that cool? What else did you want? How about respecting your wife's wishes when she's doing all the labor? She was just in labor and you accused of vanity? How entitled are you?", "So she kept you out so you wouldn't lose your attraction to her and her vanity broke your marriage? Does she even like you that much? My DIL didn't want me in the room with her when it was time to push. All it took for her to allow me in was my promise not to look at her hooha. I kept my gaze firmly on her face as I held one hand while my son held her other. I was there for both her kids but didn't actually \"see\" her push them out.\n\nPerhaps you can take that approach if your marriage survives her vanity.", "Yes, because of YOU and your selfish desire to be present during birth, despite the fact that it was making your wife uncomfortable.", "I did and I stand by my words. So women can't get their wishes respected even during BIRTH? COME ON.", "This is pretty weird to hear because there was recently a post where mom wanted to exclude dad from the birth for some equally stupid reason and she was almost UNANIMOUSLY voted TA for robbing him of such a special and profound moment.", "The vanity before the baby comment is talking about how she\u2019s on a diet while breastfeeding the baby.

I am glad I had someone I trusted at my side. \n\nI also understand how traumatized your wife seems to be. Every days, we hear horror stories of husband completely dismissing their wives once they give birth. It is a fear a lot of women have, because it happens often enough.

He did so without complaint, even if he was hurt over it. He did not mention anything and left in support of his wife.\n\nThe \"kinda lost it\" moment only occurred after the wife was dismissive of his feelings towards the matter. **OP being hurt by the decision to keep him out of the birth is not news to the wife.** Regardless of whether you agree with her decision or not, or whether you think it's justified, or if her feelings on the matter should come first, or whatever the case of the situation itself, it doesn't matter. **it is common decency to not bring up things that you know are hurtful to other people.**\n\nOP, I truly think you've handled this entire situation about as gracefully as you could've.

Personally I think it\u2019s very telling that OP calls it vanity; setting aside the birth issue - OP\u2019s wife clearly has an issue with her body and/or food. Calling it vanity is very judgemental and unlikely to ever help change anything. Vanity is a choice - his wife started restricting her food 1 month after birth and moving away from fully breastfeeding (totally against what she planned prior to the birth). I hesitate to blame hormones, but I also hesitate to assume she\u2019s been vain while being 100% emotionally and physically recovered. \n\nRambling now so I\u2019ll stop. \n\nOP, do you know if her therapist has diagnosed with anything in particular?

The thing is, by centering his unhappiness over his lack of control over a very short moment in time (and also villainizing/complaining about her dieting while breastfeeding in the post and only clarifying in comments that the baby wasn't \"starving\" because it got formula which seems pretty AH-ish to me and makes me question OP's reliability as a narrator), he's reinforcing that she gets no control.

Despite that time you both got laid off within a month of each other, and her breast cancer scare, despite all of it, for better or for worse.\n\nThe real journey is not how long you laboured for, what drugs you used, or how long it took the baby to crown, or how many stitches you had. The real journey is putting that tiny scrap of life front and centre, to do what is best for them to the very best of your abilities. To give them the best possible head start.

Harder that birthing. Sleep deprived, it hurt like hell when the baby would be sucking. I got intrusive thoughts and horrible baby blues. Add the gastric reflux, the lochia, not being able to sneeze whitout peeing yourself... Yep, I did not feel atractive. I felt like a big bottle attached to the child.

There are two separate issues here. The first is whether or not your preference is more important than your labouring wife's preference. It's not. \n\nIt's insane you think your experience of her delivery is more important than her experience of her delivery. Women die during childbirth, it's one of the hardest things anyone will do. It baffles me that as a husband and farther you wouldn't want to do everything you could (which is honestly not much because in that moment it doesn't have anything to do with you) to support her. If you are disappointed in her as a \u2018mother\u2019 which is a wildly awful and manipulative thing to say to your wife she is likely disappointed in you as a husband and farther because even this moment you couldn't priotize her. \n\nAside from that she did let you in the room the moment the baby arrived. So what are we talking about? Your ego was hurt that she asked you to leave for some of the delivery because that is the remarkable level of entitlement you feel. \n\nThe second issue is you have decided you don't agree with the reason she asked you to leave and now you are belittling her and using that as evidence that she's a bad and vain mother (see later example of breastfeeding). \n\nThat's not the point. She doesn't need a reason for asking you to leave the delivery room. She certainly doesn't need to give you a reason you approve of. She is allowed to ask you for any reason or no reason at all because it's her choice because she's the one giving birth! Any person who works in a hospital knows this. Your wife is the patient, not you. With or without you she can give birth, without her there is no birth. This is not an equal process and that's part of the gravity and gratitude most men feel when their partners birth their children. \n\nIt's convenient for you that you get to parade her reason around as evidence that she's vain. This is the part other commenters are supportive of because it's a simple equation to decide being a parent is sacred and being vain is vulgar and thus, you must be right. \nBut every reason or no reason is fine because it's her body and it's happening to her and in that moment being supportive looks like doing what she needs to feel comfortable. \n\nAll of this points to how manipulative and adolescent you are.

It's fine that you're hurt that you didn't get to be there, we all feel hurt or angry about things we know logically are unreasonable. What's not fine is you are making it her problem. Be an adult and take responsibility for your own problems. If she can't exercise her bodily autonomy without you throwing months long tantrums then you don't actually believe she is deserves bodily autonomy. You think her body exists for your wants and not her own. Your equal right to the baby starts after it is no longer inside her. \n\nYou make it sound like she is starving the baby for her vanity and that's just not what is happening. Doing a combo of breastfeeding and formula is extremely common.  As long as the baby is being properly fed and she isn't eating harmful things while breastfeeding you don't have any right to dictate what she eats.

Id have like him to never leave the whole time but made sense at least one of us get some sleep. It also meant I could sleep for a while when he returned. You muddle through I guess! They had these chairs that extended out to make an uncomfortable bed, better than nothing!", "Ugh. My husband only left to run home to check on the cats, take a shower, and to go to a job fair (he found out his job was going away while I was pregnant so employment was important!) Otherwise, he stayed at the hospital with me. He's 6'4\" and a big, broad-shouldered guy.", "Oh I know. I just loved how forward you were with your comment. Us guys can encourage each other to \u201cgo girl\u201d and it somehow make sense\u2026 right? unless I\u2019m the weird one? Maybe I\u2019m the weird one.", "What they are doing is fine and healthy for the baby -- focusing on her inability to breastfeed well because of a body issue despite being just fine supplementing with formula (which is what they are doing) isn't.", "A lot of fathers now expect to be in the room when their child is born, so I don't know if he is \"entitled\" so much, as dealing with the hurt of not being there for something that was important to him. I completely agree it's the mother's call on who is in the room, but I actually think that fathers wanting to be in the room is a good thing. We have a new generation of more involved dads, and I think wanting to be a part of everything he can be, is great. Again, still the mom's choice, but what bothers me is everyone in this thread telling him he isn't entitled to feelings. He didn't know why he was excluded for a long time, and that can hurt to know your wife doesn't trust you to be in the room and won't tell you why. His wife, if you read the post over again, has not been an Angel. And he hasn't been perfect either. While he needs to learn not to lash out at her, I do think her issues seem much deeper. In the end, I don't see this marriage lasting long if they don't get better.", "That's another reason, it is also avoided to improve the bond between mother and baby. \n\nI didn't claim it's the only reason, several doctors told my wife this.", "Yeah I do agree with that statement. I was more so stating that I understand why he is upset too and don\u2019t think his feelings should be just swept under the rug. But it\u2019s definitely something he needs to take the time to work through. If he continues to resent her over a decision that was already made, their marriage is doomed", "Which I can understand. Just from my perspective, I never understood why someone wouldn\u2019t want their husband to be there for support while they give birth to their creation (at least hold their hand) but that\u2019s just ME. Everyone\u2019s different and has a right to their own comfortability as does she.", "He did respect her wishes and he was not present for the birth. Did you not read that part?\n\nYou\u2019re being extremely invalidating toward his experience. Birth and pregnancy is traumatic for both parents involved (just in different ways) and I say this from experience, as a mom. \n\nSaying he\u2019s allowed to be \u201cdisappointed\u201d but ultimately his feelings aren\u2019t important, is a horribly harsh and cold way to think. Especially when it comes to your partner and the person who\u2019s equally responsible for this child. Who\u2019s shown nothing but love and support throughout. \n\nWe can\u2019t just pretend that pregnancy only affects the pregnant person and that\u2019s it. Because that simply couldn\u2019t be further from the truth.", "You may want to reword your post then. Because you seriously make it sound like she's starving your baby for vanity, and that fact that it isn't the case makes you sound like a super unreliable narrator.", "But WHY did it hurt you \"so deeply\"? Who told you that watching your wife give birth was your right?", "In the U.K. the husband goes home after the birth and comes back at visiting times. I was in for 5 days on both my two after c-sections. I think it\u2019s less now. He went to work and would pop in in the evenings. There was no point in him staying - what\u2019s he going to do?  I couldn\u2019t move much, was recovering from a major op, had injections every day on the first one to prevent clotting and wore compression stockings on the second. It\u2019s hard to sleep in hospital - I\u2019d never wish that on him", "May I suggest marriage counseling? Sounds like you have some resentment towards your husband.", "I am so sorry you had to go through that.", "I did.", "I mean at first I took it as a compliment but also wanted others to see not all guys are freaked out or view bodies soo negatively", "She's not getting her spleen removed, she's giving birth to his child.", "I use 13 often because it's my lucky number- because I LOVE horror movies. First I've heard of it being racist too.", "That's the main reason. The way you frame the statement is really dismissive of the health reasons\nThat's on top of how dismissive you're being about bodily autonomy", "The father has the same rights as the mom to the baby itself after the fact. He doesn\u2019t have the right to watch as the most private part of her body is torn open. He doesn\u2019t \u201cdeserve\u201d it. He got to participate in the birth process and he\u2019s holding a silly grudge.", "Kinda fucked up that we've gotten to the point where, instead of \"probably his birth year\" people see 88 and automatically assume HH. This timeline sucks.", "Yeah, I have used it because I was randomly given it to me as a jersey number when I first started playing hockey. Just kind of stuck with it since.", "As a mom of a 6 month old, that is extremely irresponsible. She will lose the weight as time goes on while feeding. She can wait on a diet, now that baby is there baby comes first.", "He also didn\u2019t try to force his way in any aspect. At any moment I could ask him to leave or step aside and he would because he was there to support us. Unlike OP trying to force his way when his wife didn\u2019t want him watching. Just because I personally didn\u2019t care, doesn\u2019t mean she has to feel the same. \n\nIf he\u2019s trying to force her out of her comfort zone for one of the biggest medical procedures she\u2019ll be going through, where stress is dangerous to both her and the baby, I have a feeling he tries overriding her in other aspects of their relationship as well.", "I'm sorry, you guys were in the hospital for FIVE DAYS FOR RECOVERY??? I got discharged less than 48 hrs after both of my c-sections.", "I don\u2019t really get the whole \u201centitlement\u201d thing. He wanted to see his child being birthed, why is that such a wrong thing to want to witness? (I can understand from the wife\u2019s perspective of not wanting him too see her vagina too). So He respected her choices and comfortability by leaving the room without argument. It\u2019d be majorly bad if he put up a fight and argued with her over it whilst she gave birth or beforehand.", "Idk how many pregnancies you've been around but its very normal for baby's 1st to 3rd weigh in to be underweight and with the amount of shame surrounding using formula (evident by these comments alone) its not surprising she feels pressured to only use breastmilk. The most important part is baby is fed and mom is getting help feeling back in control of her body.", "No. So I had a preemie. I was rushed by ambulance on the Sunday with bleeding, then my water broke Monday and she was born by C-section on Tuesday. I was discharged on Thursday (they wanted me to do an extra day but I had two kids at home), she was in the hospital for another 3 weeks.", "It's not wrong to want to see your child being born. It's wrong to think that experience is owed to you. It's wrong to feel \"deeply hurt\" for months and months over being told no. It's wrong to guilt trip his wife for saying no.", "It only became widespread knowledge in the last 7 or so years (basically the rise of Trump with all of the nazis coming out of the woodwork), before that the only people who would've assumed you were a nazi are people who worked closely with the ADL, and... actual nazis who used it as a code to identify each other.", "How can it be \"normal\" to be underweight? If it was the normal weight, it would be normal and not underweight..\n\nIt is normal for babies to lose a little weight in their very early days, but that's not what it means to be underweight.", "I\u2019m gonna press hard doubt on that being normal. If she wants to go on a diet, fine, but she shouldn\u2019t breastfeed if her milk isn\u2019t gonna be nutritious enough. Her issues sound pretty serious if she\u2019s willing to cause all this drama just so she can look good.", "Omg, I'm so sorry that happened! Cue me no longer jealous of your 5 days. I was like damn, why is mine rushing everyone out? But now I'm like damn... I thought mine were traumatic. My spinal block didn't take for the first one. And for the 2nd one, it wore off before the end.", "Honestly, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s THAT wrong to assume you\u2019d be there to support your wife through one of the hardest things she\u2019ll probably ever go through. I DO think it\u2019s wrong to guilt trip her after such a traumatic event.", "That\u2019s disgusting to disregard another persons consent like this.", "It would be the first time he's seeing it in that state.", "She has *self-esteem* issues, not vanity issues. Big difference.\n\nAnd yes, she was wrong to restrict her diet so much that the baby *needed* to be supplemented with formula; however, OP was TA here because he just sees it as \"vanity\" and not something that she needed *support* to overcome, which it obviously is.", "My guy, your big feelings are sounding a lot more like you want control and to be the center of things.\n\nYour wife went through a major life event, you tried to make it about you. You\u2019re allowed to be disappointed but you took it out on her and that\u2019s not okay.\n\nYou find out that your wife has major self-esteem issues. How were you married to her for so long and didn\u2019t have ANY CLUE? Then you talk about the health of your baby but your wife is clearly not healthy and I\u2019m not convinced you\u2019re doing anything to help her get there.\n\nHonestly the way you talk about your wife makes me think you don\u2019t really see her or understand her. I hope she gets some solo therapy and figured out how to love herself.", "People make constant jokes about seeing their child born.\n\nI even remember one stand up comedian said watching his wife birth their baby \u201cwas like watching your favorite restaurant burn down\u201d as the baby came out of her birth canal. Some comedians even joke that their attraction their wives after birth was never the same again. \n\nI can completely understand her hesitation and insecurity around the issue. Gently YTA/ESH", "Sometimes I wish married couples focusing on things that don't matter during pregnancy and postpartum would remember the reasons they got married. Go back, read your vows. Remember why you decided to have a baby. Now consider that everything you're holding on to right now won't be but a blip in 5 years. You're letting resentment ruin something you chose because of love.\n\nI have an 8 year old. I barely remember the birth, it was traumatic and awful, and postpartum was one of the hardest things I went through. But 8 years later none of that really matters. What matters is I have a healthy wonderful child. The first year is crazy and people do crazy things. Mothers lose all sense of self and bodily autonomy, it makes sense she's going through all of this. You need to step back and look at the bigger picture and let go of her need for privacy in a moment that was the hardest thing she'll ever experience.", "I think this woman has an untreated eating disorder. I think probably her husband is the reason she is terrified of getting fat and unattractive and getting dumped. \n\nThe snide comment about the breast feeding makes me think the wife should skip marriage counseling and just go for divorce. She'll never be able to be comfortable with her husband snidely blaming her if the kid turns out less than perfect.", "OP isn\u2019t the AH for being hurt and asking for space (as long as he was still close enough to help with the baby) but there are several things that seem questionable here. 1) If OP\u2019s wife has such severe mental health and/or body image issues, it is unlikely that they just manifested during pregnancy and yet they only became an issue for OP when she didn\u2019t let him spectate during childbirth. 2) These things don\u2019t happen in a vacuum. Childbirth is when women are at our most vulnerable so if she actively didn\u2019t want OP in the room then there is a reason why. \u201cBigger issues rise to the surface during marriage counseling\u2026\u201d No shit, and the lack of detail here is telling. 3) OP ripped on her for \u201cputting her vanity before her child and before me\u201d\u2014How? There were doctors there and also her mother so let\u2019s not be theatrical here. 4) Lastly, OP also cited \u201cthe health of the baby\u201d in an attempt to bully his wife into breastfeeding. Formula-fed babies are perfectly healthy and now using \u201cthe health of the baby\u201d to get his way has become a recurring theme.\n\nFinal verdict: YTA for focusing on getting your way vs resolving the lack of trust and or body image issues that make her not want you in there.", "YTA for your behaviour here, if your wife is feeling insecure then you should reassure her not berate her", "Good luck but it still looks like you're on a different page with her in regards to how she should value her own dignity.  If you can't find it in yourself to stop equating her efforts at self improvement and enforcing bodily autonomy to being less of a mother and a wife, then I don't know how much more progress you're going to make beyond that hurdle.", "And still YTA", "This is so perfect. I felt like I was losing my sense of self and it was really hard to cope with. I take medication for anxiety and depression and see a therapist regularly already so I cant imagine not having that outside support already established. That being said I think he is taking it too far by holding a grudge while they are suposed to be focused on taking care of the newborn", "How do you go from him wanting to be present for his daughter\u2019s birth to him being a rapist?", "No idea, but the only time I heard this opinion, was on reddit.", "Yes, agreed. But that wasn't her justification as to why she didn't want OP in the room.\n\nShe didn't want him to lose attractiveness to her. That's entirely on her, not the baby.\n\nIt might be better for the baby because she would be less uncomfortable, but that doesn't mean her original justification wasn't something solely about her, and not the baby.", "I was in for 5 days on both mine. They\u2019re now 23 and 21 and I think it\u2019s less now. Even so, husbands still don\u2019t stay at the hospital with you", "Sure man.
