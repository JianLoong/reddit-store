None of your business.", "ESH I wanted to say you should mind your business, but it becomes your business when you're the one driving your daughter around to get health care instead of her partner. I see what you're saying. I would be telling my adult daughter to move out and move in with him as well.  Fully be an adult or don't,  but when the repercussions of your life choices are falling on me? I'd want them to move out.  However, the pushing marriage is not your role. They need to be independent but you don't get to say in what form. And rather than nagging and hinting, just say it out: \"I'm not the third person in your relationship and I feel like by your living with me I am. I'm providing food and paying the bills, I had to take care of a screw up with the birth control,  who knows that there won't be a next time and what is your plan? It can't be me. It's time for you to move out\"", "YTA - it's obvious you are coming from a place of care and concern for your daughter, but you've pushed it too far. Marriage means different things to different people. Some people love the idea of marriage, others see no value in it. You have been pushing your marriage beliefs on to others, which you shouldn't do. There's no hint in your post that your daughter is unhappy with her current relationship status - so why would you be? \n\nMaybe try acknowledging you pushed a bit far with the whole marriage thing to your daughter, apologise and go non-wedding ring shopping with her... and perhaps promise not to push your values into their relationship again.", "YTA A lot of couples now don't get married now. Why not let them sort their finances out first, then a shared house before worrying about a bit a paper", "YTA. My parents married when I was 13, they had already been together for nearly 20 years.

If you do, fantastic. \n\nThey've been together 8yrs. Marriage, kids, housing, and finances have probably ALL BEEN DISCUSSED BY THEM over the years. \n\nIt sounds like you just want your daughter to live her life through your eyes with 'Church' coming first. They don't have to squander away money from their already limited budget to appease you (cos it sounds like you'd take over  planning and what you deem necessary for *her* wedding) cos if they wanted a marriage, they could go the court house and get it done on a Tuesday afternoon IF THEY WANTED.\n\nAlso, it might not be Mike that's afraid of commitment. It might be your daughter. Stop pushing your ideals on her.", "Ho Ho Holy Shit are YTA.\n\nPushing your daughter to get married? Asshole behavior.\n\nInsisting on it when she's already signalled she's not into that as a topic of discussion? Doubly so. \n\nDoing so around the holidays and adding stress to a stressful time? Even worse.\n\nBut what absolutely takes the cake is that you're doing this to your daughter who has been dating a dude 8 years older than herself since she was 19??? And you never felt the need to intervene?", "It sounds like you are ready for her to move out which is completely valid. It is completely acceptable to give her a deadline that she needs to start supporting herself by and stick to it. How she goes about leaving the nest is up to her but she is 27.

I\u2019m not sure why you thought you needed to include extra details about your daughter\u2019s miscarriage in your description of how you keep pressuring her to get married.

Are you just trying to get her to move out of your house? \n\nYes, you\u2019re TA for continuing to push your child to get married. While she\u2019s in law school. No, you don\u2019t get a pass because she had a miscarriage.", "YTA. Are you always so controlling and judgemental? I'm sorry - your daughter should 'give herself some respect in the relationship'?!? Slut shaming your own daughter, lovely. She'll go no contact in a few years.", "YTA. You've voiced your opinion, you've seen their reactions and now it's time to back off. You can't nag them into getting married so, for the sake of you and your daughters future relationship being at least cordial, don't try that.", "YTA - why are you even asking this?

I fear you will not get a culturally appropriate judgement here.", "\"She suffered a spontaneous abortion at 5 weeks and didn't even know she was pregnant\"\nSo she had a miscarriage then.

It's like parents are dead set on pestwring their kids about either having kids or getting married. \n\nAre they both devout christians? Highly doubt that, as premarital sex was taking place, so why (if they don't wish to) would they even get married in a church? \n\nAnd even if, what is a piece of paper going to change for you? Are they happy? Do they love each other? Yes? Then marriage is not going to change anything apart from legalities/admin practicalities.\n\nBut it's their choice, and you're just alienating them.", "Obviously YTA.\n\nYour daughter & her partner are both adults and they do not have to get married just because you want them to.\n\nApologise to both of them and keep your nose out of their business.", "YTA \n\nfinishing school before marriage was a big thing for me, maybe it is for your daughter too. \n\nSo I married my bf after 8years", "Your daughter was 19 when she started dating a 27 year old .... why do you want her to marry someone she shouldn't have dated in the first place?They don't behave like husband and wife cos they don't live together.....\n\nGetting married isn't a guarantee of respect or protection.

They know where their relationship is and what steps they\u2019re ready for. Also if she\u2019s in law school and he\u2019s in debt it might be best to not combine households and finances.", "That\u2019s not for you to decide. \n\nShe\u2019s a grown ass adult. Stay out of her relationship. It\u2019s none of your business. \n\nYTA", "By she should 'realise certain things' you mean she should see everything exactly as you do? Shes your daughter, shes her own person with her own wants and desires. You should be proud youve raised a daughter thats in law school, you should be overjoyed that shes happy because thats the only status that matters in life.\n\nHave you supported her through her miscarriage? (miscarriage not abortion btw from the context), is she still grieving, has that impacted the relationship? Do you even know how they feel about that now? Maybe this is what you should focus on rather than what YOU want. YTA.", "YTA. As a mother of 2 grown men let me tell ya something mom, BUTT OUT! You made your choices and lived your life, this is THEIR lives and THEIR choices.", "I just think it's weird that their relationship started at 19 and 27. \nI wouldn't want my daughter married to that kind of man especially since Mike's life situation shows that he is still immature", "Oof, I didn't realize the age difference, and how young your daughter was at the time. I would have been *very* concerned when she brought him home.\n\nI could understand if you were worried whether or not she's happy, or if he in any way mistreats her. Telling them your expectation to get legally married isn't doing that. You've brought it up enough that your daughter shuts down and stops engaging you. \n\nYou're shooting yourself in the foot from having any possible heart-to-heart to ask how she feels and get an honest answer.\n\nYou need to apologize for overstepping. Tell her it was wrong of you to pressure her into the mold you've made for her in your mind. You can tell her you were concerned for her happiness *only* if you emphasize how you realize that worry came from within you, and you alone, and you won't put that on her again. *Then stick to your word.*", ">But because I think that not only because of the age difference between them but also because it has been my daughter's only relationship, she should realize certain things.\n\nthose are 2 great reasons for them to break up not get married. ew.", "You aren\u2019t helping, you are interfering. She\u2019s clearly made it know (by your own comments) that she wants you to stop bringing it up and doesn\u2019t want your \u2018help\u2019. If you keep pushing her, she might step right back from you in order to keep her own peace. She\u2019s a grown up. You need to let her sort her own life out.", "How does a 27 year old who has lived at home her entire life not have two months of savings?\n\n\nAnd I'm confused by pronouns. Whose father died? Who owns the house? Who is living in it? Who is getting the money from the renter?", "You sound.. uhh.. not right in the head.. YTA", "Grow. TF. Up", "I'm not sure you caught my drift! Help in the way that is asked of you. What you think best isn't relevant. It shows more care than the world usually allows to give somebody space for their own free will. You already raised this topic with both halves of the pair and received a negative response. Accept this or make it a battle of wills, to defeat the wishes of the other (an awful idea). Give the gift of acceptance, it is sorely lacking.", "Why not let them move when they have the finances instead of moving in getting into more debt and having to move back out", "She rejected your idea. Unwanted help is not \"help\". It's interfering, it's harassment. You are forcing your opinion onto her.", "What is wrong with you? If SHE has a house, why are you renting it out? What do you do with the rent money from HER house? Especially since she wants to save money.\n\nAnd what person hears \u201cI want to save money\u201d and thinks \u201cbut you have a grill\u201d?", "Ok, is that *her* house, or *your* house? Did he leave it ***to her***, and you are renting it out for ***your*** benefit?\n\nYou aren't interested in *helping*, you are interested in *controlling*, and *dictating* what they should do... **in your eyes**. \n\nSo, time to just shut up. Nobody *wants* to start out with a balloon mattress and a grill.", "I didn't say sarcastic, I said snide. You directly referenced something that she'd told you not to.\n\nShe's an adult. It's not up to you to decide what's best for her, it's her.\n\nYou're ignoring her boundaries. This is what leads to the Low contact/no contact relationships you see on here. It sounds like you've had a pretty good relationship otherwise but this may very well be a breaking point.\n\nIt's not up to you or your son to judge when or IF they decide to get married. If they are happy in their relationship just leave it.", "The more you explained, the more AH you are. You even tried to show her an engagement ring after she got upset at your attempts. Do you not get a hint? Keep your youngest son out of this too. You are the one who has a problem with it. Don't be surprised when your daughter decides that your place is no longer safe place for her.", "And why is getting married the best for her?", "Nope, you just want what's best for you. Because it looks bad at church that your daughter isn't married yet.\n\nShe told you off when you mentioned it the first time. Mentioning it again and trying to impose your life milestones on her if selfish.", "This feels like one of those things that the medical community should update their terminology on then.", "The first one is a practical concern the second is just being noisy", "Apologies, I thought I read abortion.", "She helps with the prayers and attends mass when she goes, sometimes they even look to her for support, as she did with her cousin a few months ago organizing the religious part of the wake of a relative of hers. And she also organized her paternal grandparents' mass for her 50th wedding anniversary and she seemed very excited, but when we talk about her wedding, whether religious or civil, she changes the subject or says it's not time.", "When my daughter told me about Mike at the beginning of their relationship, the truth is that I didn't like him at all, and I even told her not to get her hopes up because maybe he would be married, but he isn't married nor does he have children, I have come to like him and he has shown be a good guy", "[removed]", "She\u2019s in university so I would imagine any savings she had probably went towards helping to pay for books and tuition.", "Does she think we still live in the 80s? In a lot of countries (mine included) the house market is extremely expensive as well as everything else, meanwhile our jobs still don't pay us more to catch up with the price of things. People can't afford housing like they used to", "'But you have a grill.' My chin hit the floor when I read this!! Can just imagine them applying for any big financial loan, 'how much money do you have saved?' 'Nothing but we have a grill.' Good grief!", "Because they have already been asked about their future, and what they will do.\n\nAnd I think it's not very responsible on Mike's part, because he doesn't step forward.\n\u200b", "Ah so it's not about religion it's about you being noisy lmao", ">he has shown be a good guy\n\na good guy doesn't date teenagers when he is nearly 30", "You told her \u201cnot to get her hopes up\u201d about a 27 year old when she was 19? So at 19 you told her not to get her hopes up for marriage? Have you always been this focused on marrying off your daughter??", "\"They already have a grill\" needs to become a Reddit memeable moment. \n\nYTA OP. Mind your business. And give your daughter her house back.", "So you said jump, and they should reply with \"how high?\" Wow! \n\nSounds to me your daughter doesn't care about getting married either. Only YOU.", "It's scary to think someone like op works with potentially vulnerable patients. She can't listen or tell what is appropriate to decide for other people, or respect boundaries.", "But why is getting married the best for her? Why is getting married \"the responsible thing\"?", "It is clear it is your daughter that does not want to get married", "And why is getting married best for her? You seem to have completely failed to answer that question.", "Maybe they just -*gasp*- don't want to get married? My partner and I have been together for a decade and have a kid, house, life together. We aren't married and never will be, we do not see any value in it. And since you appear to be super religious, your daughter possibly just doesn't want to tell you any of that since you'd get upset. Leave her alone, stop being a pest. All you're doing is driving her further away.\n\nAs an aside, your attitude of \"some couples get married with absolutely nothing and make it work\" is disgusting. Your daughter is trying to do the right thing and make her life a bit easier by working and saving up before moving forward. Why should she go backwards and create issues in her life? She's got you for that.", "Maybe it's your daughter's decision not to marry yet. If she's in law school, my daughter did a law degree & a law diploma, she'll have enough to deal with without having the added pressure of planning a wedding! Leave them alone & let them live their lives as they choose.", "And they have been together for 8 years too now. So move the f on. This is not about the age gap. It's about OP refusing to get her nose out of her adult daughter's business."]}
