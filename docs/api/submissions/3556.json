There is no excuse to not wear a helmet, and it's good for your kids to shame your BIL into wearing one.", "My mother read some article or book decades ago about how fragile the brain is in its little pocket in folks' heads and if she could have had her way - The ENTIRE WORLD would have worn helmets like astronauts - lol!\n\nHowever, she admitted it might be overkill and unpopular.\n\nMany states mandate helmets for bicycles as well as motorcycles for just that reason & smart skateboarders often wear helmets.\n\nAs your children are under age, it is your job to parent and try to make them as safe as you can.
