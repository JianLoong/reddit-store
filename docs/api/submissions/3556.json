My kids used to listen to a song all the time about why you need to wear a helmet, and while it's not quite that graphic, it doesn't shy away from the fact that you need it to protect your brain.

But don't tell them Uncle Jack will be \"fine.\"  If he ever gets in an accident, he'll most likely be an organ donor. :(  The best thing your kids can do is beg their uncle to wear a helmet to protect his brain.

It's probably going to involve a shovel and a fire hose.\n\nJack is playing the odds - and he's likely to come unstuck at some point. Falsely reassuring the children that Jack is going to be just fine is setting them up to be hurt. You can tell them that Uncle Jack is an adult and has the right to make his own choices BUT you are their parent and YOU get to make the choices for them as far as things like this are concerned. That Jack is a safe driver but it's really important to wear a helmet - because *other people* aren't always good drivers and you want them to stay safe.\n\nI see no problem with them being up Jack's ass about this.

The only problem I see with what you told them is that it's somewhat inaccurate, they're more likely to get a concussion or break their neck. But putting __accurate__ scary images in kid's heads I have no problem with unless the kid has some type of anxiety issues or something that makes them especially sensitive to that. Kids aren't as fragile as people think, and fear isn't always bad if you're afraid of real dangers.\n\nIn my country, helmets for motorcycle riders are mandatory by law. I have no sympathy for people not wearing them, especially around kids. Like, even if you jaywalk or do something similar, you should never do that when any kid is around, just so you wouldn't set a bad example. You're welcome to risk your own life, but not to teach kids dangerous habits.", "Fuck no you're not an asshole for making sure your children are safe, Jack is an immature child that shouldn't be driving a motorcycle.", "How is this an exaggeration is that is what actually happens?\n\nYou tell your kids not to touch the wood stove bc,they will burn themselves.\n\nYou tell your kids to leave the kitchen knives alone bc they'll cut themselves. \n\nYou tell your kids to wear a helmet while cycling bc theyll have a head/brain injury.\n\nNTA", "NTA.

You aren't god.  You can't make him be fine.  Her solution is to make them never trust you again after his accident.

She does Uncle Jack a favor by not getting involved.  He should take their advice.", "NTA But your BIL is for the example he is setting.", "NTA. My brother was riding his bike without a helmet and had an accident resulting in major head trauma. He cracked his head on the curb and shattered a piece of his skull. The internal bleeding had squeezed his brain to 1/2 his skull by the time the ambulance got to the ER.  He was 11 and while he is relatively ok now, it took his entire childhood from him. He spent his entire school experience in special Ed, no prom, no graduation ceremony, no college acceptance. He didn't start life again till mid 20s. He's nearly 40 now and still suffers memory loss and hand eye coordination issues. Wear a f###ing helmet.", "NTA\n\nYour kids shaming Jack might make him make the responsible choice to put on a helmit", "NTA, worked with the medical examiners office.  I can verify that brains do come out of your skull when you crash w/o a helmet.  May have needed a bit more tact on explaining it to the kids, but they still need to understand that he is taking a risk and the chance of him getting seriously injured is higher than normal.  I would tell them that you do not agree with what he is doing but being an adult he has the choice to choose.  I would also mention that if he does get injured because of it you will be very upset and you don't that to happen to them.", "NTA your BIL is actually an organ donor in waiting. Continue to stress to the kids that what he is doing is dumb", "NTA, your BIL is tempting fate, and is doing WORSE by not enforcing the helmet rule with your kids. One thing to put himself at risk, but your kids?!? You can remind them that kids don't even have fused skulls yet, so they're extra squishy. It's always good to be honest with your kids when you can, but ESPECIALLY for safety. Google motorcycle gear post-crash for extra fun for the family! (it's not gore-y, because when you're Doing It Right, the gear is what takes the damage, not the person underneath. [Don't necessarily actually show your kids that, I'm kidding, but maybe show your wife because she should know it's serious, and the last thing you want is your kids to keep the \"helmets are LAME\" mindset on something more speedy than your average bicycle.]) And what does your wife plan to say to your kids if her brother ACTUALLY gets into an accident, because he will probably Not Be Fine. As brutal as it is, in the hopefully unlikely event of your brother Finding Out, your kids are going to be doubly crushed their parents lied to them.\n\nAlso, if your BIL's life choices can't stand the scrutiny of a first grader, that is Possibly A Sign.

For example, did you know you\u2019re 10x more likely to die falling down the stairs than you are bicycling? But I wouldn\u2019t want my kids scared of stairs. Cautious and careful? Sure. Scared? No. Fear and stress is hard on kids, and I am not pro fear-based parenting. But, to each their own, I suppose.", "I never said not to tell your son about burglars; I agree with that. And I think it\u2019s appropriate to tell your son that he can suffer a traumatic brain injury if he falls without a helmet. But there is no need to go into all the details about oozing brains. \n\nIf it\u2019s not enough of a deterrent for your son to avoid a brain injury, then I don\u2019t think the gory details will help."]}
