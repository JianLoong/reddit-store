They always wore their helmet until that one particular night when it was warm out, the breeze was right, stars were out- just too gorgeous of a night to wear a helmet. \nThey hit a deer, completely totaled the motorcycle, was in ICU and still has lasting injuries 13 years later. \nOh, and the helmet that was strapped to the back of their motorcycle? Completely fine. \n\nNow that person gets really tense when they see someone driving their motorcycle without a helmet. I\u2019ve had friends get into accidents, one didn\u2019t wear a helmet and has scars on their face from it, another did wear one and had road rash all along one side of their body. \n\nIt\u2019s not a joke, and I\u2019m sorry your BIL won\u2019t take his safety seriously.", "Used to work in an ER. Trust me, you didn't exaggerate.", "NTA. I distinctly remember at age 11 (5th grade D.A.R.E. lecture) a local law enforcement officer hiving a very descriptive lecture about what would happen to us if we didn't wear our helmets while riding our bikes or roller skates/blades, I believe he made use of eggs and jello in his lecture. Also, in drivers ed class, we were shown graphic photographs of accident scenes, including one of a helmet less motorcycle rider who ended up with no head and every other exposed bit of flesh was unrecognizable also. Maybe ask your local first responders for similar images to show your wife and BIL and ask them how they would describe such images to your children. You could, in a few years, do the egg demo for your children just to drive home the imagery you have set in the minds. Your BIL is an idiot for not taking appropriate safety precautions.", "NTA there are fates worse than death and many of them can be caused by a serious head injury.\n\nHow would he feel about his family feeding him baby food and washing and wiping him for the rest of his life? How would he feel if he lost the ability to speak, or remember anyone he knows?

The fact if get matter is that if Jack has an accident, he is not likely to be fine, and your wife would be wrong to tell your children that he would be.

You also did not lie to them.", "NTA, and you should also put more pressure directly on Jack to wear a helmet, for the sake of his niblings, not only as an example, but so they don't lose their uncle.", "NTA that\u2019s just good parenting. My dad died in a motorcycle accident, he always wore a helmet as far as I knew but he wasn\u2019t that time and despite being extremely experienced on a familiar road, he died horrifically. Definitely scare the crap out of anyone who doesn\u2019t want to wear a helmet.", "While I agree with using bike helmets always, the way you explained it to your kids was wrong. They are clearly freaked out. While that might be effective, it can also be damaging depending on the kid's personality. \n\nMy mom was an ICU nurse in \\*the\\* major regional trauma hospital. She used to scare the shit out of me with stories so I wouldn't do \"dangerous\" things. Like I used to play with candle wax from lit candles so she told me about the girl who was doing that and caught her nightgown on fire. (She died) Or she found me hand feeding the squirrels in the backyard and told me about the guy who came in with rabies and how when they realized what was wrong, all of the staff had to get 20 shots in the stomach. Guy died, of course. I was about the same age as your kids. \n\nAt my house, my kids hear \"I DON'T WANT ANY HEAD INJURIES TODAY\" repeatedly. They'd also hear about how their brain was important and we want to protect it. And \"uncle Jack doesn't live in our house.

You didn't exaggerated, that's an underestimation of how bad motorcycle crashes get. Despite being 3% of passenger vehicles on the road, cycle crashes are 9% of passenger vehicle fatalities.

The technical term for a person involved in a donorcycle crash is \"meat crayon.\" Men 18-34 who ride motorcycles without helmets are the largest contributing demographic to organ donations, but they usually only get 3 organs out intact. Not only will uncle jacks' brain come out, his heart, lungs, kidneys, or liver will come out too - on an operating table, into someone else's torso. They won't get his corneas though, because his face will probably be gone.
