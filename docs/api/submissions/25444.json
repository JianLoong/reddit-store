This is going to eat at you, and if you\u2019re too scared to ask that really says something about your relationship and communication. It\u2019s not an heirloom, If it was, he would have told you already and shared the family story. It is odd and inappropriate to propose with the same ring that he proposed to someone else with. Not saying he\u2019s still carrying a flame for the ex, he could just be clueless, but it\u2019s still inappropriate \n\nInfo: why don\u2019t your friends AND family not like him? In my experience, if all your friends and family don\u2019t like your significant other, that is a HUGE red flag and maybe you should listen to them.", "NTA. I think you\u2019re ok in asking him as long as you approach it delicately. It\u2019s typically frowned upon to \u201crecycle\u201d an engagement ring, but men are often oblivious to these things. He was probably just trying to save money. Don\u2019t take the comments on his ex\u2019s post to heart - all those people are going to take her side regardless and won\u2019t think twice about how their comments may affect someone else (you). I am concerned however when you mention your friends and family don\u2019t like him - to me that\u2019s a huge red flag. What has he done in the past or how has he treated you that would make them not like him? Sounds to me like there may be more to the story here.

What about your friends? If they don\u2019t either, you might consider taking a step back and ask them all why. You said you were \u201cjust so elated to be engaged\u201d. Could you be blinded by loving being in love and now having a wedding to plan while ignoring possibly not seeing issues with him?\n\nRemember that it\u2019s the marriage that counts since the wedding is one day.

She accepted but if she hadn't, well, any refusal would not have stopped any future proposal with the same ring.\n\nPerhaps the prospective groom saved up and bought what he felt to be The Absolutely Perfect Ring to offer as a token of love. This shouldn't be about what strangers on the internet think, it's about whether you want to grow old with the man offering the engagement ring, or whether a ring is even that important.", "YWNBTA, quite frankly, the only way you would be the ah is to not ask him the questions that are running through your mind. If your relationship is solid, he won't have a problem with either the questions or in providing the answers.", "NTA - definitely ask.\n\nHowever, I do think you might have a bigger problem if you can't talk to any family/friends about this because they hate him so much. Is the ring really your biggest problem?", "I feel like it's a really tacky and lazy move in his part. Maybe your friends and family have good reasons for not liking him. \nYwnbta for asking him about it. You probably won't like the answer though, because there's nothing that says, I really thought about *you* when I decided on this ring. It's going to be something lazy like, I already had it.", "NTA. Just ask him. You can tell him you love the ring and are thrilled to be getting married, but you were unsettled by her posts and would be grateful for clarification/reassurance about his reasoning. Don't assume anything bad, just talk to him.", "NTA communication is key, if you're going to spend your life together you should be able to have an adult conversation about it, which, admittedly, it's kinda weird.

Talk to your fianc\u00e9 calmly. Mention you came across her post. If he chose the ring he likely loved it and spent a great deal of money on it which makes it difficult to leave it sitting in a drawer. Perhaps you could have a jeweler make some minor changes to the ring to make it more custom to you. He probably should have asked you about reusing the ring in advance. Ultimately you have the ring and him, that\u2019s what counts.", "NTA, but if asking him about the ring would ruin your relationship, then your relationship is not as strong as it should be.\n\nYour question is valid. IMO he should have been upfront with you, especially given how easy it is to access just about anything on SM.  \n\nDiamonds and gold are expensive and this is most likely why he is recycling it.

Who cares?", "He\u2019d be eating a fucking massive loss then.\n\nI mean I *kinda* get it, but eating a ~60% (or very likely a good deal more) loss on a perfectly good ring is a hard pill to swallow.  I mean I\u2019d argue he could then try to pick up an estate piece, but he\u2019s still be getting a much lower quality ring for the money after taking into account the markups on even estate jewelry and the fact that a private seller isn\u2019t going to get the price a reseller is on a piece.\n\nThe thing is OP was happy with the ring, it was someone else being catty that even made her question it, seems like the ring isn\u2019t the issue, the ex is.", "Hey OP wheres the update?", "Why?

There's some people that just piss you the fuck off by existing and it doesn't mean you have feelings for all of them.

He didn't pick that out for you. He didn't care what you might like or what your tastes are. \n\nThat's the issue I see here. He could sell it for $500 and buy you a $20 ring from Etsy.
