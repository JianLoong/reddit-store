This is going to eat at you, and if you\u2019re too scared to ask that really says something about your relationship and communication. It\u2019s not an heirloom, If it was, he would have told you already and shared the family story. It is odd and inappropriate to propose with the same ring that he proposed to someone else with. Not saying he\u2019s still carrying a flame for the ex, he could just be clueless, but it\u2019s still inappropriate \n\nInfo: why don\u2019t your friends AND family not like him? In my experience, if all your friends and family don\u2019t like your significant other, that is a HUGE red flag and maybe you should listen to them.", "NTA. I think you\u2019re ok in asking him as long as you approach it delicately. It\u2019s typically frowned upon to \u201crecycle\u201d an engagement ring, but men are often oblivious to these things. He was probably just trying to save money. Don\u2019t take the comments on his ex\u2019s post to heart - all those people are going to take her side regardless and won\u2019t think twice about how their comments may affect someone else (you). I am concerned however when you mention your friends and family don\u2019t like him - to me that\u2019s a huge red flag. What has he done in the past or how has he treated you that would make them not like him? Sounds to me like there may be more to the story here.

What about your friends? If they don\u2019t either, you might consider taking a step back and ask them all why. You said you were \u201cjust so elated to be engaged\u201d. Could you be blinded by loving being in love and now having a wedding to plan while ignoring possibly not seeing issues with him?\n\nRemember that it\u2019s the marriage that counts since the wedding is one day.

She accepted but if she hadn't, well, any refusal would not have stopped any future proposal with the same ring.\n\nPerhaps the prospective groom saved up and bought what he felt to be The Absolutely Perfect Ring to offer as a token of love. This shouldn't be about what strangers on the internet think, it's about whether you want to grow old with the man offering the engagement ring, or whether a ring is even that important.", "YWNBTA, quite frankly, the only way you would be the ah is to not ask him the questions that are running through your mind. If your relationship is solid, he won't have a problem with either the questions or in providing the answers.", "NTA - definitely ask.\n\nHowever, I do think you might have a bigger problem if you can't talk to any family/friends about this because they hate him so much. Is the ring really your biggest problem?", "I feel like it's a really tacky and lazy move in his part. Maybe your friends and family have good reasons for not liking him. \nYwnbta for asking him about it. You probably won't like the answer though, because there's nothing that says, I really thought about *you* when I decided on this ring. It's going to be something lazy like, I already had it.", "NTA. Just ask him. You can tell him you love the ring and are thrilled to be getting married, but you were unsettled by her posts and would be grateful for clarification/reassurance about his reasoning. Don't assume anything bad, just talk to him.", "NTA communication is key, if you're going to spend your life together you should be able to have an adult conversation about it, which, admittedly, it's kinda weird.

Talk to your fianc\u00e9 calmly. Mention you came across her post. If he chose the ring he likely loved it and spent a great deal of money on it which makes it difficult to leave it sitting in a drawer. Perhaps you could have a jeweler make some minor changes to the ring to make it more custom to you. He probably should have asked you about reusing the ring in advance. Ultimately you have the ring and him, that\u2019s what counts.", "NTA, but if asking him about the ring would ruin your relationship, then your relationship is not as strong as it should be.\n\nYour question is valid. IMO he should have been upfront with you, especially given how easy it is to access just about anything on SM.  \n\nDiamonds and gold are expensive and this is most likely why he is recycling it.

It could be handed down - but really that doesn\u2019t matter if everybody who matters to you thinks he undervalues you and is controlling.", "Hope it all works out for you \ud83d\udc95", "Trust is the cornerstone of any relationship, and the only way to keep that solid is to communicate openly with one another.", "Do you not live together?", "I can completely understand why you're upset.  This is why I say that he should have been upfront about it.  He had to have known how active his ex is on SM and that you would find out.\n\nPeople on IG and other SM can be mean and probably don't know what they're talking about 80% of the time.  They're making suppositions about your relationship and about your fiance when they probably know very little about either. \n\nBut...you should still talk to him. Tell him how you feel and hear him out as to why he recycled the ring.  If you're not comfortable redesigning the ring then just tell your fiance that you would prefer not to wear that ring. Tell him exactly what you've said here. \n\nI agree about not telling your family.  Too many opinions...especially when you know they won't be positive ones...are just going to muddy the waters. And really, it's not their business. This is between the  two of you.\n\nGood luck!", "Honestly and completely, the only way to settle this is to talk to him about it. Ask his reasons. He's the only one who can give you any clarity.", "They claim he looks down on me/my family because of our background. My family are blue collar labourers and he comes from a white collar family. He has never made such indication. He once asked my father to teach him how to fix easy things around the house so he can help me. My father and other family members took offense to this. He never made such a comment again. I suspect there's some jealousy there but I'm not too sure. \n\nThere have been vague claims of him being controlling but these are baseless, especially when they can't provide any examples. \n\nMy friends think I'm too good for him but don't say why. Everything just feels kind of orchestrated by my family to be honest. Especially because one of my best friends is a close family friend we've know for years.", "There is another comment from me explaining this under another comment. Keep in mind it's reaching 4am here so my response may not convey exactly what I want it to. \n\nBut basically my dad is a blue collar worker and my fiance is white collar. In the past he said he would love to get advice from my dad on how to fix easy things around the house so he could help me out, we'd just moved in together at the time so everyone was talking about our new home etc.\n\nMy dad took offence to this and basically called him ignorant. (I sense that my dad may be insecure in his job but idk.) I failed to see it tbh but since everyone always follows what my father says they all seem to think he looks down on them, and as his daughter he looks down on me too.\n\nSince then they've tried to pick out his 'flaws' but they never give me examples or reasons so I've learned to just ignore it. For example they call him controlling but can't pick out a time when he was. I'm still close to my family and friends but I just keep my fiance away from their toxic behaviour.", "There is another comment from me explaining this under another comment.

Honestly, it sounds like you are trying not to see his flaws since you were so giddy to be engaged to him. The question he asked seems harmless, but how he asked it might not have been. And most of the things he has done that set people on edge might be the same. On the surface, it could be read two different ways and it makes it hard to directly point out how it is wrong, but it doesn't mean it\u2019s  right. It sounds like this influencer talks about him. What has she said on her channel about him? You need to start looking at the big picture, because everyone not liking him should be ringing alarm bells.", "Your family is just looking for something not to like about him. They might be intimidated by his money and will not admit it.\n\nYour family is not the issue it\u2019s that he gave you a right meant for someone else. Not matter someone status that is wrong. At least he could take the diamond and out it in a different setting but he was to lazy to do that.", "ah I  completely understand now.  a key to any relationship is communication. I would just ask your fella. thank you for answering me back.", "Yes I saw this and thank you for re-posting! But I had actually read it already before I wrote what I did.

You say you love him more than anything but honestly every post about a relationship begins like this, and then unravels.", "Haha that\u2019s fair!", "No problem! Always willing to clear up any misconceptions. I would've added this in the post but there's a character limit set by the moderators and it was too much extra stuff to add.

In Eastern European countries, they won't even take a broom from their old home to a new home.

I really hope you don't end up being the second woman to give that ring BACK on the other end of this conversation. \n\nBut like others have said.  You ABSOLUTELY HAVE TO ASK HIM. Especially, since this is bothering you, as it should. He gave that same ring to another woman to symbolize wanting to spend the rest of his life with her. \n\nThere are so many layers to this story. Also, I wouldn't go around telling your friends and family about this either. They will only strive to like him less after finding out. You could also, respectfully, ask his salty @$$ ex HOW SHE FOUND OUT!.", "A $5,000 engagement ring gets about $400 when sold to a pawn shop. So if he spent $5k on a ring that he has, its current value is $5k, but the second he goes to sell it, it loses more than 90% of its value.", "From one self destructive to another, put down the phone, and go to sleep. \n\nDon't catastrophize. His ex made a post out of hate and jealousy, and she did it with the intent to hurt your relationship. \n\nHe probably gave you the ring because you made it very clear that you aren't materialistic. I promise you. He knows he's been blessed by going from someone like that to someone like you. \n\nStop over thinking, don't wake him up, and don't let the crazy come out. \n\nTalk to him calmly, tell him you saw her post, and it made you feel a little insecure, and tell him you'd like to sell it (if it's not an heirloom) and get rings for each of you. \n\nI promise you he proposed to you because he loves you. It's a little weird using the same ring, but guys just don't think like we do, and he probably didn't think it was a big deal. \n\nI'm rooting for you, girl. Take a second before you react, and remember, it's the two of you against the problem, not against each other.", "There are only a couple of reasons where giving you the same ring is exceptable ifnits an heirloom or ridiculously  exspensive other than that he should have got you a ring that reflects tou not one he chose for another women ,if she called tou her replacement did he cheat with you", "Where did OP said her family and friends don\u2019t like OP\u2019s fiancee?", "NAH.\n\nIt's fair to ask, there could be many reasons.  One of which you thought of, that it was passed down in the family.  Whatever the reasons, if it's causing you this much mental distress then just ask and go from there.  If the answer or reaction to asking is bad enough to end your relationship then it's probably for the best.", "If your relationship is too fragile for you to even feel comfortable having that conversation, then it's nowhere near to the point where yinz should be considering marriage. Slow down!", "This is only my opinion, but I would feel a little upset if my husband proposed to me with a ring he gave his ex. \n\nI know engagement rings can be horridly expensive. But I wouldn\u2019t care if he bought me ring from a discount store. The point is is that we are in a new relationship and I am my own person. I am not the same woman he was previously dating and I will not be seen as the same as her. \n\nHe could have sold that engagement ring. And used all (or some) of the proceeds to buy you your own ring. One that he took the time to think about, you and your relationship and how the ring would reflect who you are. \n\nTo me he took the easy way out. You have every right to ask about your ring.
