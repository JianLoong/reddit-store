My condolences.", "Do I find it weird? Yes. 100% I cannot imagine my mother doing that. But this is your family.

Your children are with you on your decision.", "NTA, but I hope you understand why your husband's relatives were upset. It's highly unusual for a widow not to attend her own husband's funeral. I get why you didn't go. You have issues, and your husband was cool with it. I am glad your kids were okay with it, too.

People process grief differently, even if there's no trauma attatched to it. I personally hate funerals (and hospitals) and avoid them at all costs. No trauma, I just greatly dislike them. Grieving in your own way is perfectly fine, and especially given that you had the blessing of your family to not attend, you have no reason to be at fault. I'm so sorry for your sudden loss, and doubly sorry that your extended family is making it worse.", "NTA. Your husband knew. Your kids knew.

You said your children understand and your husband also understood and was ok with you not attending . So who cares what anyone else thinks or says. F them and whatever they think or say. My aunt and uncle did the same. My uncle passed first and my aunt didn't attend any of the services.  We did gather at her house after the burial.  We respected her and choice to not attend.  We did ask and my cousin said that it was a choice his parents agreed on. We only asked cause we didn't see my aunt there and we respected and accepted the answer. My aunt passed 6 months later. Noone in our family or uncle's family disrespected our aunt for not being there. We were there for her and her family in her time of mourning. OP I hope you read my comment  and I want to tell you I'm sorry for what your are going through.  As long as your children are there tell everyone else to fuck off and if you can't say that just block anyone who is judging you. You don't need them in your life if they can't be supportive of you when you are going through one of the most toughest things anyone of us have to go through.  You surround yourself with the ones that are there for you and fuck the rest. No matter if they are family or friends.

Don't respond don't worry and remember he knew you better than they ever will and you knew him better! So pull those doubts out of your head and just concentrate on you and your kids.

I don't want people stood about crying nor do.i want any ceremony just burn me and be done with it. Happy never to attend anyone else's either. I'm sure I'll have to along the way sadly.

You are grieving and however you wish to do that is your business. The fact that your kids are ok with it is great, but frankly a bonus, and it is outrageous that anyone has the audacity to share an opinion about this and have a go at you at this time. I would say this is a great opportunity to slimline the people you keep in your life. Anyone who thinks they have the right to comment or judge your grieving process aren\u2019t worth your time.

I\u2019m sorry this is further distressing you, but you\u2019re NTA here in my opinion. Take some time for you.

Any emails that are genuine condolences can be moved back to the inbox for you to read later, and the toxic ones can be thrown in the bin where they belong.
