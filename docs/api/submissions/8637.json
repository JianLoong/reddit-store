Your children are with you on your decision.", "NTA, but I hope you understand why your husband's relatives were upset. It's highly unusual for a widow not to attend her own husband's funeral. I get why you didn't go. You have issues, and your husband was cool with it. I am glad your kids were okay with it, too.

This is you as an adult going to your husband's funeral where your surrounded by others who have genuine feeling about your family. I understand your husband said he didn't mind but it could be different as its your kids who need your support. Regardless of how old they are or how far they live it's going to be hard. I'm sorry for your loss.", "Absolutely NTA. Like OP, my mother used to drag me to funererals for EVERYONE she saw in the paper. Now thats she's elderly, she needs me to take her. I guess it's a Catholic thing? Well I'm not Catholic anymore. I totally get where you're coming from. If your husband and kids are fine, you are fine. Grieve in your own way.

Everyone asked me where he was and some people were so appalled that he didn't show up.  I heard it at the service and was contacted about it after.  He has some pretty extreme anxieties and simply couldn't handle it, so I told everyone who asked that he had his own way of doing things and it was OK.   Crazy thing is, some of these people who were so concerned with his presence hadn't been present in her life for years :) Definitely TA's!", "If your husband passes before you do, go for a 'celebrating their life' type funeral instead of a sombre affair. Loud music, party style, funny stories, and encourage bright clothes, etc, etc.\n\nFor the OP, NTA, everyone grieves in their own way. People are also often judgemental, so long as you, the deceased, and your children are ok then I would consider the rest as noise.", "I can't believe all the dislikes I have.\n\nMy perspective also comes from a broken place.

Your children were okay with it.\n\nOther people do not matter. You're grieving in your own way and that's more than enough. You've spent your whole lives together, it's okay. The funerals are for the living anyway and you've already said goodbye.\n\nI'm so sorry for your loss, and I hope you heal with time. Wish you all the best.", "NTA.\n\nI am sorry that you recieved those e-mails, nobody should be forced to deal with that after losing their husband. It is unforgivable, but it is understandable. After a sudden and terrible loss sometimes people try to find someone to blame, because it is easier than actually dealing with their emotions.  It is unfortunate that your absence in the funeral gave them something to direct their blame at. I would delete those e-mails and forget about them. It is on them, not on you.", "NTA", "I\u2019m very sorry about your husband. It sounds like you have a lot of unhappy and unhealthy associations with funerals as a result of your mother\u2019s decisions. I\u2019m glad you know what your husband\u2019s wishes were regarding a funeral, and that you absolutely have your children\u2019s understanding and blessing not to have been there.

You made the choice you needed to make for your own sake. I\u2019m glad you didn\u2019t force yourself to go. I wish you peace with your decision.

I once got dragged by the back of the neck to go see the corpse of someone who didn't want a funeral in the first place because me not hanging out with the corpse meant I didn't care. I learned a long time ago I am not allowed to grieve until other people are done pretending to grieve. Not your kids because they actually care just all the people sending you emails. Ignore them and now you have the time and space to grieve the way you want to. How do you want that to look like.

You get to decide how you want it to look like.", "NTA\n\nHis mother is saying you not attending is \"disrespecting\" him by not going, but he literally said that he didn't care if you didn't go so long as you mourn him in your own way.

These are really the only people's wishes you should have been concerned with. One thing that sucks about death is almost everyone will tell you what you should do, extended family, friends, and even those that aren't so close to you.

Don't let anyone else tell you guys how you should grieve or act during this time.", "My paternal grandmother actually pulled me aside the last time I visited her and told me that she would never expect me to go to her funeral. My grandfather was already gone and she knew funerals made me anxious and overwhelmingly depressed (as in put into a non-functioning haze, not grieving. I grieve plenty for those I have lost). My dad thought it was something I would regret forever...it's been quite a few years and I don't. My grandma understood and didn't expect me to go on a 12 hour car trip just to be at her funeral when I had instead hopped on a plane to see her when she was still alive (despite my horrid anxieties about flights). \n\nI have only attended one funeral - my maternal grandfather's and that's because we raced there to try to make it in time and we didn't, so we were in town and he and my grandmother didn't know many people and I felt I needed to be there for her. However, for me they kept it closed casket for the service until they gave a warning at the end they were going to open it and none of my family had an issue with me stepping outside. When I think of my grandparents, they are alive and smiling at me. My mind can't intrusively place them in a casket in my head because I didn't see it. It would try, believe me. \n\nQuite honestly, I view my grandmother giving me that permission as the most true example of her love and understanding she could display for me. I miss her like hell and I will always appreciate that she understood the difficulty I would have and sought to preemptively make it easier on me.", "And what kind of people send hateful emails to a grieving widow? They were not privy to the conversations about funerals OP had with her husband and kids and there is no \u201cright\u201d was to mourn.

Say she doesn\u2019t- the reason is hardly one that would come up over thanksgiving dinner, after all. Then she\u2019s leaping to the most heartless assumption about the woman her son chose to spend his life with, without bothering to find out whether she was sick, or too distraught to travel, or otherwise incapacitated.

All because my mom was the executor for his will and refused to give them any money because my uncle's wishes was that it all went to his girlfriend and his kids.

Both were fine with this and liked the idea. I felt a bit guilty for about a moment but I\u2019d consulted everyone as close to my mother as I was, and besides, she\u2019d donated her body for research anyway, it\u2019s just that the university couldn\u2019t take her because she\u2019d died suddenly and had a post mortem (actually rather hard to donate your body in the U.K. it appears). \nNow if my partner dies before his mother and/or sister, and they don\u2019t take his body either, (the university I mean) I\u2019d probably so ok to them arranging a funeral if they want, I probably wouldn\u2019t go. I\u2019d throw him a party at a later date. We can see that being a bit of an issue so he makes a point of mentioning he doesn\u2019t want a funeral to them. But if that\u2019s what they need, then we\u2019re ok with that for them. But when it\u2019s my mother, if it\u2019s ever my partner, then what I need is also reasonable.", "The *also grieving family*, who apparently have no idea why his wife wasn't there and are now wondering all sorts of things about what that says about her relationship with her husband and children?  Sure, they handled it badly, but then again, they are grieving as well and maybe not making choices they usually would either.", "For all they know she wasn't there because she was literally sick with grief. Heartless to judge, and none of their business.", "Oh this is hilarious", "As a mother who has lost a child during her childhood, I'd like to assume better of my other children's future spouses.  Like maybe they were hurting so badly they couldn't be public with their grief.\n\nI understand that MIL is hurting too and in a deeply personal way.  That does not excuse her lack of kindness.", "I think that person just read the headline and not the actual post.", "Exactly this. I'd be very concerned if I didn't see a spouse at my kids funeral. Like I'd assume that they were hurting too much to attend and would probably want to check in to make sure they didn't need any extra support."]}
