Sure, maybe legally dogs are allowed, but it's a playground geared for kids and kids should get first priority in that sort of area. Not to mention your son's fear of dogs is absolutely valid and he should not be forced out of his comfort zone until he is ready. I agree that it is a good thing to work on, but it's not realistic for a 3 year old to be able to differentiate what fears are rational and which ones are not.", "NTA.

I don't care how good natured your dog is. You don't know if kids are allergic. Dogs knock kids over unintentionally because they don't know their own size. And finally, in my experience, the people who are usually the most entitled with their dogs being in public spaces are the ones who don't train them or have any control over them. People who make the effort to properly obedience train their dog never let them bother other people.

I do not want to take any chances of something happening to my dog or anyone else being scared or uncomfortable. I used to be afraid of dogs when I was a child and I completely understand anyone who is too.

If that's the case here, then the other guy is a jerk and NTA.\n\nThat said 1) you may want to work on your son's fear of dogs, especially given nearly half of households (at least in the United States) have one 2) if there's a dog owner who is violating the rules of a playground that doesn't allow dogs, the likelihood that person is going to leave is pretty low. Better to just leave until they are gone, and perhaps drop a note to whatever city or local council group maintains the parks to complain.", "ESH - depending upon the local laws, yes, the dog should have been on a leash and away from the equipment.\n\nThat being said, from everything I've read here, it seems the dog was friendly and playful.

Bird shit, wild animal feces, rotting candy, and who else knows what else is already there.", "Thats true.  \n\nBut in our case we did things with our dogs, but we didn't always do it together.", "This^^^^. And when they do clean up, it\u2019s only poop. They will let their dogs Lisa everywhere, and children play everywhere", "I also think single adults hanging out alone at the children\u2019s playground equipment with a bunch of kids is very weird.\n\nMost playgrounds around me specify that adults must accompany children there (it\u2019s only enforced when necessary though).", "Yes. This is the issue. Some have \"solved\" it by adding a lid. But I think that's not really a solution. Feral and neighborhood cats could come along and use it in between patrons of the playground. Or else, at the end of the day... you have to rely on strangers to do their due diligence", "No, but addressing your original point dogs are a regular part of human society, if only as an artifact of human evolution.\n\n[https://greennews.ie/how-animals-shaped-the-evolution-of-humans/](https://greennews.ie/how-animals-shaped-the-evolution-of-humans/)\n\n>The dog is the first domesticant and had the most profound effect on human evolution. It\u2019s been argued that without dogs you don\u2019t have any other domestication, you don\u2019t have civilization. The dog was domesticated and widely established across Eurasia before the end of the Pleistocene, well before cultivation or the domestication of other animals. \n\nsummary: without the domestication of dogs, humans would not have domesticated horses, oxen, sheep, etc. Without those steps in human history, we would not have evolved past hunter-gatherers, thus dogs are a regular part of every existing human society - with maybe an exception for the Sentinelese tribe.\n\nSorry. I blame Neil deGrasse Tyson for making this so interesting to me.", "I thought he was describing a child too lol", "EH not enough facts to know if you were TA or not. \n\nWe don't know for sure he wasn't with one of the other kids.\n\nWe also don't know if the playground in question bans dogs in it/on it. Most of the comments see projecting their nearby playground rules. I've never seen this ban in my area. I'd suggest researching your playground rules.\n\nDude is an AH for not leashing his pup and putting his dog at risk of getting hurt. \n\nI assume the issue was your phrasing I would have maybe been like hey can you keep your dog away from my kid. \n\nIt\u2019s also generally not worth it or save to argue with strangers in public assuming your in the US.", "YTA- parks are public spaces. Dude has every right to be there with or without a kid.", "I mean... everyone is having a good time, dog deals well with kids, kids are happy to play with dog, owner is attentive and your kid is slowly learning that dogs aren't dangerous. And then you start. Unpopular opinion but yeah yta.", "Yta. He has every right to be there", "YTA, you were in a public place trying to enforce your own opinions on other people.  He has every right to be there with his dog as you do with your child unless there is some specific law you can cite that says otherwise.\n\nIt would be the same if your child was bothering his dog and he asked you to leave the playground with your son.  If someone merely existing and being near you in a public place is a problem, then you're the problem and need to leave.", "My 2 year old is terrified of other people's dogs when they approach. We literally own a large dog, who she adores. She understands what to do around dogs, she just doesn't like being around strange dogs. It is entirely age appropriate for this kid to be wary of animals they do not know, especially when you consider that the average dog weighs the same or more than her. I find it much more annoying when parents go out of their way to make their kid approach every dog they see.", "This should be higher tbh", "This comment is asinine.  Good god use some common sense", "Absolutely not.  That is beyond fucking dangerous to be letting a toddler near an unfamiliar dog.  There are too many shitty dog owners to assume it won't attack for no reason.", "This comment is pure absurdity", "They shouldn\u2019t be literally everywhere.  \n\nA 15 pound dog can still bite and is dangerous to young kids.", "I\u2019m not making a judgment, but this is your argument\u2026. Kids who put their hands EVERYWHERE have to worry about a dog sitting on a slide? And that\u2019s the reason this is wrong? Cmon\u2026.  A dogs asshole I\u2019d probably the cleanest place a child would stick their fingers.", "Yeah where I am it would be totally ok for the dog to be off leash at a lot of parks. My own dog likes going down slides, but I never let her do it if there\u2019s children there", "So it\u2019s a park", "Your response seems like a response of a moron. If the choice is a dog I don\u2019t know possibly attacking my child and kicking a dog and ALSO kicking the owners ass? There\u2019s no choice. \n\nA dog is not more important or equal to a child\u2026at a children\u2019s park. Dumb ass", "Ugh I hate those retractable leashes.. don\u2019t know a single vet or trainer that recommends them. I could never control my dog on one of those. And people walk their large dogs with them all the time.", "When we tried leash training our cat we used one\u2026 only because she was 2 pounds and we could pull her back.", "I\u2019m not saying I\u2019m going to go out of my way to kick this dog; stop it lol. \n\nI don\u2019t want to hurt any animals. Ever. But if the owner REFUSES to control their animal at a place designated for my child and other children to play - I will have no choice but to take matters into my own feet if I am scared of that dog approaching my kid. \n\nDogs belong at dog parks not on the playground WITH the children. Are you people insane? We don\u2019t know your fucking dog. We know dogs can rip kids apart. Fuck off with this shit holy fuck.", "The overall point was that even without dogs, these public places are disgusting. There are also rodents, pigeons, gross adults\u2026", "I don't mind when their dogs Lisa, but if they let them Sarah or Michelle, then that's another story!\n\n\n:D", "They're saying 33% of the entire world, not 33% of every country other than US. It's a percentage of global population, not every country."]}
