He seems like an AH.", "NTA.\n\nI see a lot of people pointing out that if there are no signs against having dogs present, then it\u2019s ok for them to be there.\n\nI\u2019d like to point out that it\u2019s a dog on the EQUIPMENT. Equipment that is only rated for children. Yes, your dog can be there in the area and around the grass. But the equipment is unacceptable. Are there signs that children aren\u2019t allowed at dog parks? No, but it\u2019s understood that children should not be using dog equipment or running up to dogs at dog parks. This is a safety issue. The dog could also get injured on the equipment that is not made for them.", "NTA the dog wasn\u2019t even on a leash which I highly doubt is legal. But also, I don\u2019t *love* when people bring kids (with no dog) to my apartments dog complex and let them play on the dog stuff. When they\u2019re there with their own dog and parents it\u2019s totally chill, but when they don\u2019t have a dog\u2026 they\u2019re playing on stuff that the dogs pee all over and chasing the dogs (that they don\u2019t know) around which isn\u2019t safe for the same reason unleashed dogs on a kids playground is not safe. Not all kids are familiar with dogs and not all dogs are familiar with kids. \n\nIdc how well trained the dog is, kids can\u2019t be super unpredictable and if they\u2019re not used to dogs and been taught how to interact, could do something that sets the dog off and causes a bite\u2026 and in a kids playground of all places would most likely lead to the dog having to be put down and a child injured (and potentially traumatized because they didn\u2019t get the opportunity to meet dogs in an appropriate way with adult guidance because dogs presence was forced on them in a space meant for children). That dog owner is an AH. You 100% are NTA and good on you for saying something.", "nta. if it's a playground for children, there are playgrounds just for dogs...there called dog parks....and the fact that the dog was unleashed makes it much worse.", "nta. dogs play in dog parks not playgrounds", "NTA most playgrounds are no pets allowed.", "NTA, playgrounds are for kids not dogs. But honestly, you should help your son work through his fear of dogs. He's going to be encountering them for the rest of his life, it's unavoidable. It's in his best interest to have at least a basic understanding of them.", "NTA. Sure, maybe legally dogs are allowed, but it's a playground geared for kids and kids should get first priority in that sort of area. Not to mention your son's fear of dogs is absolutely valid and he should not be forced out of his comfort zone until he is ready. I agree that it is a good thing to work on, but it's not realistic for a 3 year old to be able to differentiate what fears are rational and which ones are not.", "NTA.  He was probably violating some kind of leash law, but even if he wasn\u2019t, it\u2019s just common sense that a children\u2019s playground is for children.", "NTA. This is my nightmare. Playgrounds are for children, and there are enough hazards without unleashed dogs getting involved. Especially since you told him your son was afraid of dogs and he didn\u2019t control the dog.", "Huge NTA.\n\nRecently had something similar happen and I was really uncomfortable. But in this case the owner didn't actually notice the dog had followed somebody else in through the gate and was hanging around some kids for about 5 minutes before the guy realized and put the dog back outside the fenced area. The dog seemed chill but you just never know.", "I think the rule is that dogs have to be 5 meters from the playground. At least it is in Canada... Some dog owners think their so entitled.. Just douchey really", "NTA, but your son is going to encounter dogs in his life. Might be time to start desensitizing him to them", "NTA. Dogs must be leashed around children's playground and bbq areas by law in my country. It is rarely signed though because it is also pretty common sense. Just like it is common sense I take my kids to the children's playground and not the dog park closer to where I live.\n\nLaws aside, I hate AH who let their dogs off the leash in kids playground. I don't care how good natured your dog is. You don't know if kids are allergic. Dogs knock kids over unintentionally because they don't know their own size. And finally, in my experience, the people who are usually the most entitled with their dogs being in public spaces are the ones who don't train them or have any control over them. People who make the effort to properly obedience train their dog never let them bother other people. It is the AH who are too lazy to properly train their dog, have 50/50 chance of the dog listening to their commands at best who think it is cool to let their dog run around unleashed in a kids playground.", "INFO: Is there a rule that states that dogs can't be at the playground?", "NTA for wanting your kid to play safely. Dog owner is definitely an entitled AH.", "I mean if there\u2019s not signs prohibiting dogs on the playground then technically he has every right to allow his dog there. \nI get why you\u2019d want him to leave but if he had every right, he really wouldn\u2019t have any reason to listen. \n\nI get where you\u2019re coming from though", "NTA. I will say there is nothing wrong with working your dog on playground equipment provided it\u2019s leashed, no one else is there, and you back off if kids come up and want to use the playground. The different surfaces are great practice and socialization/exposure. You getting heated with him isn\u2019t great, but I can\u2019t say \u201cE S H\u201d because any decent person should hear, \u201cmy son is nervous around dogs\u201d and immediately get their dog off the playground equipment.", "If the dog was not on a leash, then you are NTA at all. I\u2019m a dog owner and I really do not like letting my dog off a leash in playgrounds or anywhere where it\u2019s not meant for dogs even though my dog is well trained, behaved and well socialized. I do not want to take any chances of something happening to my dog or anyone else being scared or uncomfortable. I used to be afraid of dogs when I was a child and I completely understand anyone who is too. It\u2019s a public space and people should take responsibility for their pets, not let them roam about without a care in the world.", "NTA but it would be a real benefit to your son to introduce him to a gentle dog in the future. Giving him boundaries of course by letting him know all dogs are not nice but at least helping him overcome the fear. The playground is for children, not dogs, but so many people have them he won\u2019t be able to completely avoid them..", "NTA.  Unleashed dog around kids is a recipe for disaster.", "I understand both points of view. You are mildly the AH unless there is signs that say no dogs on the playground or must be leashed.  \n\nA few parks near us don't allow them on the playground, but the ones that do I usually do take my dog on if no one is playing.(in my case kids excite my dog so we avoid them)", "[deleted]", "YTA\n\nUnless the playground has a sign that says \"No dogs allowed\", he is 100% correct and has just as much right to use the playground as you. You were the only person that had an issue with it because your kid is scared.... That's a \"you\" problem, not an everyone problem. \n\nSounds to me like the dog was friendly and all the other kids were enjoying his/her company.", "NTA for feeling that way because I agree playgrounds are for kids not animals. But also if there was no sign saying they\u2019re not allowed he was permitted to be there. You did the best thing by just leaving if your child was uncomfortable. But I know I personally would\u2019ve been right by my child if someone did that at a playground and the dog was able to go like they want. I don\u2019t trust anyone\u2019s pets. I wouldn\u2019t have said anything but been on guard. My child\u2019s safety comes before the dog owners feelings so they can feel how they want", "NTA- he had an UNLEASHED dog around children. It\u2019s a safety risk. Even well-trained dogs can bite unfamiliar people in stressful situations. The dog owner was 100% the AH in this situation. It\u2019s not a dog park, and his dog wasn\u2019t in his control. \n\nAlso a family member of mine suffered a vicious dog bite last year because someone had a dog off leash. It took months for recovery and many painful visits to a wound care specialist. I love dogs, but they need to be supervised.", "NTA but you could have used it as an opportunity to introduce your child to dogs", "Yes, you\u2019re in the wrong.  It\u2019s a public park, not your personal playground.  If your kid is scared of dogs, start getting used to them\u2026. Dogs are everywhere and they have as much right as your kid to be in public", "YTA. A 15 pound dog is nothing to worry about. You should work on acclimating your son to dogs. They're literally everywhere.", "[deleted]", "INFO: were dogs permitted in the playground?\n\nGenerally, dogs aren't allowed in playgrounds in my experience. If that's the case here, then the other guy is a jerk and NTA.\n\nThat said 1) you may want to work on your son's fear of dogs, especially given nearly half of households (at least in the United States) have one 2) if there's a dog owner who is violating the rules of a playground that doesn't allow dogs, the likelihood that person is going to leave is pretty low. Better to just leave until they are gone, and perhaps drop a note to whatever city or local council group maintains the parks to complain.", "ESH - depending upon the local laws, yes, the dog should have been on a leash and away from the equipment.\n\nThat being said, from everything I've read here, it seems the dog was friendly and playful. This could have been a perfect opportunity to approach the owner and ask if you both could use this time to introduce your kid to dogs in a controlled way to help them get over their fear. Instead, you came out swinging when you were the only one with an issue.", "YTA.  If there's no sign prohibiting them, then parks ARE for dogs, too.  You should be helping your son get over his irrational fear.  Man's best friend, ya know?", "What is the law in your country? In my country dogs aren't allowed on playgrounds, you can see a sign that bans it on every playground. What's more it's illegal to have your dog unleased out of your property, within the borders of the town except for \"dog runner parks\" (fanced separated area especially for dogs to play).\nIf non of these rules apply to your country he has every right to be there. But as it is a playground he is still an A-hole if he is asked to leave and refuse.", "YTA   \n\nPublic parks are for everyone, including guys with nice dogs.", "Info: were there any signs with rules regarding dogs being in there? In the city or town where you live, are the laws regarding the dogs needing to be on leash all the time?", "INFO\n\nWhat are the rules of the playground and leash laws in your neighborhood?\n\nOut of curiosity, why is your son afraid of dogs? Are you working on that with him?", "YTA. It's not their fault you're raising such a fearful child. You should be teaching him to NOT be scared of dogs. It could affect him the rest of his life, which would rob him of the joys of being with dogs.", "INFO: Was the dog on a leash? Was it well behaved?", "if there is a sign saying no dogs allowed, NTA.

You can take your kid somewhere else.", "NAH solely because the dog wasn't leashed and you have a right to ask. However he is perfectly within rights to say no. Playgrounds should be for everybody and your child's fear is something you need to handle. You don't own the playground.

Can you report to your local parks and Rec dept and maybe they can put a sign up?", "NTA - I am pretty sure all my local playgrounds both don\u2019t allow dogs, and don\u2019t allow adults not accompanied by children. \n\nJustified or not a guy with a dog trying to play with kids would get himself listed on a Facebook page as a potential creepier and people would call the police. You were a lot calmer about it then many people would have been.", "NTA was the dog unleashed ? I would call the by law officers or whom ever if you see him at the park with his dog unleashed again. You can\u2019t argue with stupid so don\u2019t waste your breath.", "INFO\nAre dogs permitted on the playground", "NTA. The guy should go to a dog park. Also knowing dogs they like to shit and piss everywhere and that is very disgusting when it happens right were kids play. \n\nAnd a dog without a leash around little kids just makes it dangerous. What if a little kid steps on its tail or hit the dog. That can even happen per accident. I wouldn't trust an unknown dog to not retaliate and bite.", "NTA. There are play areas for dogs. The dog was off the leash around little kids. This man is a bad pet parent.", "NTA at all. Without sounding judgy... given that this was a childless adult in a child zone of a playground... I wouldn't be surprised if he is the type to have pictures of minors on his computer, and is using the dog to lure in kids to add to his sick fantasies.", "NTA\n\nNormally there are big signs saying no dogs\n\nI'd have taken a video of the guy asking why he had an unleashed dog in a playground and posted across social media\n\nGuy is obviously a major AH", "INFO: 1) Was it reasonable to think this guy should've assumed dogs are disallowed in the playground?  (For instance,  is there a sign stating no dogs allowed or is the playground on private property?) \n2) Is the law on your side for another reason?  (Such as is there a leash law in the area or park?)", "NTA. I also have a small dog and have never thought to bring her to a playground.

The few yta comments i\u2019ve seen are obviously entitled dog owners. It doesn\u2019t matter if the playground says no dogs or not it\u2019s common sense that those are for people not dogs. Nothing wrong with having the dog near the playground but having them on the actual equipment is a whole other story especially if they\u2019re unleashed. The dog could get hurt or run into a kid while on the equipment and get them hurt.", "NTA.  Next time you see them at the park with the dog unleashed, please call animal control.  You\u2019ve tried the \u201cnice\u201d tactic, but you are right: the playground is for kids.  Additionally, I\u2019m getting creepy vibes from someone with no kids bringing a dog to the park.  Maybe I\u2019ve listened to too many podcasts, but this type of behavior definitely gives the impression that he\u2019s getting the younger kids \u201cwarmed up\u201d to his and his dog\u2019s presence for untoward actions.", "NTA. Dogs should not be on playground equipment and more likely than not there\u2019s a sign that says something to that effect. Is it worth arguing over, meh. I\u2019d probably just pack up my kid and go somewhere else at that point. Not worth the confrontation", "Dog parks are not for kids. Playgrounds are not for dogs.

Did the other children continue to have fun or was their good time ruined by this exchange. Like after you left, did the other kids still get to play with the dog?

They have dog parks everywhere! I love dogs so much, but a dog shouldn\u2019t be on the playground, first some are allergic, second the guy didn\u2019t even have a kid with him, third we don\u2019t know the temperament, fourth he could relieve himself on the playground, 5th there are dog parks.", "NTA - I'm a dog owner and wouldn't think to let my dog play on the equipment if there were other people at the park - especially young children who were obviously afraid.", "NTA! Hell in some places adults without minors can not be at the playground!", "NTA, he shouldn't have his dog there - it's not a dog park. I know people claim that their dog would never hurt anyone, but honestly, under the right circumstances, terrible accidents happen. You were protecting your child, and hewaa being a weirdo. I find it bizarre when people bring their dogs to a park so the dog can use the slide and whatnot.", "Whether the dogs on a leash or not, it doesnt change the fact that that owner is an asshole", "This dog owner is crazy. I understand using a park with your dog when there are no children around but who actively encourages their dogs to play with kids they don't know.\n\nAny risk to the kids aside, the dog could just as easily be bullied/grabbed/traumatised by boisterous kids who don't know how to act around them.\n\nOP NTA", "Not to mention fidos dirty butt rubbing on the swing seats, the slides\u2026.\n\nIt\u2019s a health hazard", "A dog park near me actually DOES have a sign saying something about no kids under 6 because of the potential for being knocked over by big dogs. Same safety issue about a big dog using equipment for kids as young as 3 or 4.", "People are so reliant on signs that common sense and nuance are out the window. People complain that we need signs for every little thing, no matter how obvious, but if people think if there\u2019s no sign then you\u2019re good to go, what\u2019s the solution?", "I live in a medium sized town. We have tons of dog parks. But they are just fenced in grass.", "While you make a point about helping the child overcome the fear, in my experience that is really difficult when the dog is unleashed and running wild. It needs to be a controlled exposure where the child can interact slowly and build up comfort. Having the dog run at him is not going to help that. Hopefully OP can get him around a calm leashed dog and give him a good experience.", "Op has said there was no signs saying no dogs", "Op has said there were no signs to say no dogs allowed", "If there\u2019s no signs up prohibiting me taking a massive shit on your doorstep, then technically I have every right to do it?", "I know lots of adults who have dogs but no kids, or their kids are grown and have moved out.

I find this suspicious as well.", "Op said in comments there were no signs", "Op has put in comments there were no signs", "Worst dog bite I ever got was from a 'friendly' dog under 15 lbs.

When we lived in another state there were rules about adults being at playgrounds, they must be with a child. I mean, come on, common sense stuff here.", "If it was well behaved and friendly, why not use this as a chance to help your child make some small progress over his fear of dogs?\n\nNTA but also why not try and help your child gain some confidence around dogs, fear isn't fun.", "100 percent. I have two Malinois and for the most part they love people but they both have patches on their harnesses that say ask to pet and we never let them off leash outside of our fence or the fence at their trainers. We have a bunch of kids and dogs that are unleashed in our neighborhood and that is one of my biggest fears is that either some kid or a yippie little dog will come running at my girls and they will react and then they will want my dog put down for being aggressive or they will want me to pay for the bills. I keep them on a five foot leash so they are always under my control. \n\nOP is NTA.", "Except that the use of animals to gain childrens trust is a known grooming technique and there really isn't any good reason for him to be insisting on his dog playing in a children's playground.", "I mean, OP is 100% NTA but also if you think playgrounds don\u2019t already have traces of kid poop and pee (and vomit and whatever else you can possibly think of) you\u2019re delusional.", "It is actually a good self preservation instincts of a 3 year old to stay away from dogs he doesn't know. As someone much older than him I stay away from unleashed dogs I don't know myself. That the dog is unleashed in public already means that the dog has a bad owner and I don't trust bad owners of raising their dogs well. And in the case of children they might do something wrong accidentally to a dog and even a generally nice dog might retaliate and bite.", "Dogs are not \u201ca regular part of human society\u201d lol. There are many countries in the world where keeping animals as pets is not at all common. \n\nI\u2019ve lived in 3 such places (on 3 different continents) and am currently living in one now.

I have a dog and a toddler. We go to the playground for the toddler to socialize and play. I leave the dog at home.
