He seems like an AH.", "NTA.\n\nI see a lot of people pointing out that if there are no signs against having dogs present, then it\u2019s ok for them to be there.\n\nI\u2019d like to point out that it\u2019s a dog on the EQUIPMENT. Equipment that is only rated for children. Yes, your dog can be there in the area and around the grass. But the equipment is unacceptable. Are there signs that children aren\u2019t allowed at dog parks? No, but it\u2019s understood that children should not be using dog equipment or running up to dogs at dog parks. This is a safety issue. The dog could also get injured on the equipment that is not made for them.", "NTA the dog wasn\u2019t even on a leash which I highly doubt is legal. But also, I don\u2019t *love* when people bring kids (with no dog) to my apartments dog complex and let them play on the dog stuff. When they\u2019re there with their own dog and parents it\u2019s totally chill, but when they don\u2019t have a dog\u2026 they\u2019re playing on stuff that the dogs pee all over and chasing the dogs (that they don\u2019t know) around which isn\u2019t safe for the same reason unleashed dogs on a kids playground is not safe. Not all kids are familiar with dogs and not all dogs are familiar with kids. \n\nIdc how well trained the dog is, kids can\u2019t be super unpredictable and if they\u2019re not used to dogs and been taught how to interact, could do something that sets the dog off and causes a bite\u2026 and in a kids playground of all places would most likely lead to the dog having to be put down and a child injured (and potentially traumatized because they didn\u2019t get the opportunity to meet dogs in an appropriate way with adult guidance because dogs presence was forced on them in a space meant for children). That dog owner is an AH. You 100% are NTA and good on you for saying something.", "nta. if it's a playground for children, there are playgrounds just for dogs...there called dog parks....and the fact that the dog was unleashed makes it much worse.", "nta. dogs play in dog parks not playgrounds", "NTA most playgrounds are no pets allowed.", "NTA, playgrounds are for kids not dogs. But honestly, you should help your son work through his fear of dogs. He's going to be encountering them for the rest of his life, it's unavoidable. It's in his best interest to have at least a basic understanding of them.", "NTA. Sure, maybe legally dogs are allowed, but it's a playground geared for kids and kids should get first priority in that sort of area. Not to mention your son's fear of dogs is absolutely valid and he should not be forced out of his comfort zone until he is ready. I agree that it is a good thing to work on, but it's not realistic for a 3 year old to be able to differentiate what fears are rational and which ones are not.", "NTA.  He was probably violating some kind of leash law, but even if he wasn\u2019t, it\u2019s just common sense that a children\u2019s playground is for children.", "NTA. This is my nightmare. Playgrounds are for children, and there are enough hazards without unleashed dogs getting involved. Especially since you told him your son was afraid of dogs and he didn\u2019t control the dog.", "Huge NTA.\n\nRecently had something similar happen and I was really uncomfortable. But in this case the owner didn't actually notice the dog had followed somebody else in through the gate and was hanging around some kids for about 5 minutes before the guy realized and put the dog back outside the fenced area. The dog seemed chill but you just never know.", "I think the rule is that dogs have to be 5 meters from the playground. At least it is in Canada... Some dog owners think their so entitled.. Just douchey really", "NTA, but your son is going to encounter dogs in his life. Might be time to start desensitizing him to them", "NTA. Dogs must be leashed around children's playground and bbq areas by law in my country. It is rarely signed though because it is also pretty common sense. Just like it is common sense I take my kids to the children's playground and not the dog park closer to where I live.\n\nLaws aside, I hate AH who let their dogs off the leash in kids playground. I don't care how good natured your dog is. You don't know if kids are allergic. Dogs knock kids over unintentionally because they don't know their own size. And finally, in my experience, the people who are usually the most entitled with their dogs being in public spaces are the ones who don't train them or have any control over them. People who make the effort to properly obedience train their dog never let them bother other people. It is the AH who are too lazy to properly train their dog, have 50/50 chance of the dog listening to their commands at best who think it is cool to let their dog run around unleashed in a kids playground.", "INFO: Is there a rule that states that dogs can't be at the playground?", "NTA for wanting your kid to play safely. Dog owner is definitely an entitled AH.", "I mean if there\u2019s not signs prohibiting dogs on the playground then technically he has every right to allow his dog there. \nI get why you\u2019d want him to leave but if he had every right, he really wouldn\u2019t have any reason to listen. \n\nI get where you\u2019re coming from though", "NTA. I will say there is nothing wrong with working your dog on playground equipment provided it\u2019s leashed, no one else is there, and you back off if kids come up and want to use the playground. The different surfaces are great practice and socialization/exposure. You getting heated with him isn\u2019t great, but I can\u2019t say \u201cE S H\u201d because any decent person should hear, \u201cmy son is nervous around dogs\u201d and immediately get their dog off the playground equipment.", "If the dog was not on a leash, then you are NTA at all. I\u2019m a dog owner and I really do not like letting my dog off a leash in playgrounds or anywhere where it\u2019s not meant for dogs even though my dog is well trained, behaved and well socialized. I do not want to take any chances of something happening to my dog or anyone else being scared or uncomfortable. I used to be afraid of dogs when I was a child and I completely understand anyone who is too. It\u2019s a public space and people should take responsibility for their pets, not let them roam about without a care in the world.", "NTA but it would be a real benefit to your son to introduce him to a gentle dog in the future. Giving him boundaries of course by letting him know all dogs are not nice but at least helping him overcome the fear. The playground is for children, not dogs, but so many people have them he won\u2019t be able to completely avoid them..", "NTA.  Unleashed dog around kids is a recipe for disaster.", "I understand both points of view. You are mildly the AH unless there is signs that say no dogs on the playground or must be leashed.  \n\nA few parks near us don't allow them on the playground, but the ones that do I usually do take my dog on if no one is playing.(in my case kids excite my dog so we avoid them)", "[deleted]", "YTA\n\nUnless the playground has a sign that says \"No dogs allowed\", he is 100% correct and has just as much right to use the playground as you. You were the only person that had an issue with it because your kid is scared.... That's a \"you\" problem, not an everyone problem. \n\nSounds to me like the dog was friendly and all the other kids were enjoying his/her company.", "NTA for feeling that way because I agree playgrounds are for kids not animals. But also if there was no sign saying they\u2019re not allowed he was permitted to be there. You did the best thing by just leaving if your child was uncomfortable. But I know I personally would\u2019ve been right by my child if someone did that at a playground and the dog was able to go like they want. I don\u2019t trust anyone\u2019s pets. I wouldn\u2019t have said anything but been on guard. My child\u2019s safety comes before the dog owners feelings so they can feel how they want", "NTA- he had an UNLEASHED dog around children. It\u2019s a safety risk. Even well-trained dogs can bite unfamiliar people in stressful situations. The dog owner was 100% the AH in this situation. It\u2019s not a dog park, and his dog wasn\u2019t in his control. \n\nAlso a family member of mine suffered a vicious dog bite last year because someone had a dog off leash. It took months for recovery and many painful visits to a wound care specialist. I love dogs, but they need to be supervised.", "NTA but you could have used it as an opportunity to introduce your child to dogs", "Yes, you\u2019re in the wrong.  It\u2019s a public park, not your personal playground.  If your kid is scared of dogs, start getting used to them\u2026. Dogs are everywhere and they have as much right as your kid to be in public", "YTA. A 15 pound dog is nothing to worry about. You should work on acclimating your son to dogs. They're literally everywhere.", "[deleted]", "INFO: were dogs permitted in the playground?\n\nGenerally, dogs aren't allowed in playgrounds in my experience. If that's the case here, then the other guy is a jerk and NTA.\n\nThat said 1) you may want to work on your son's fear of dogs, especially given nearly half of households (at least in the United States) have one 2) if there's a dog owner who is violating the rules of a playground that doesn't allow dogs, the likelihood that person is going to leave is pretty low. Better to just leave until they are gone, and perhaps drop a note to whatever city or local council group maintains the parks to complain.", "ESH - depending upon the local laws, yes, the dog should have been on a leash and away from the equipment.\n\nThat being said, from everything I've read here, it seems the dog was friendly and playful. This could have been a perfect opportunity to approach the owner and ask if you both could use this time to introduce your kid to dogs in a controlled way to help them get over their fear. Instead, you came out swinging when you were the only one with an issue.", "YTA.  If there's no sign prohibiting them, then parks ARE for dogs, too.  You should be helping your son get over his irrational fear.  Man's best friend, ya know?", "What is the law in your country? In my country dogs aren't allowed on playgrounds, you can see a sign that bans it on every playground. What's more it's illegal to have your dog unleased out of your property, within the borders of the town except for \"dog runner parks\" (fanced separated area especially for dogs to play).\nIf non of these rules apply to your country he has every right to be there. But as it is a playground he is still an A-hole if he is asked to leave and refuse.", "YTA   \n\nPublic parks are for everyone, including guys with nice dogs.", "Info: were there any signs with rules regarding dogs being in there? In the city or town where you live, are the laws regarding the dogs needing to be on leash all the time?", "INFO\n\nWhat are the rules of the playground and leash laws in your neighborhood?\n\nOut of curiosity, why is your son afraid of dogs? Are you working on that with him?", "YTA. It's not their fault you're raising such a fearful child. You should be teaching him to NOT be scared of dogs. It could affect him the rest of his life, which would rob him of the joys of being with dogs.", "INFO: Was the dog on a leash? Was it well behaved?", "if there is a sign saying no dogs allowed, NTA.

You can take your kid somewhere else.", "NAH solely because the dog wasn't leashed and you have a right to ask. However he is perfectly within rights to say no. Playgrounds should be for everybody and your child's fear is something you need to handle. You don't own the playground.

Many areas a leash is defined as physical or verbal. \n\nMy area, the signs just say leashed, but when you read the actual law, it says, \"the leash may be physical or verbal so long as the dog is able to demonstrate its ability to follow verbal leash commands and the owner keeps a physical leash on their persons.\" Off leash areas are where your dog is allowed to run and play without being focused to listen immediately for leash commands. \n\n\nMy dog I'd put a harness on him with a handle for emergencies and an 18\" stubby leash in my pocket. 95% of the time, he's off leash. He won't leave my side until I tell him to go play. Only times I've had to grab his harness were other people's dogs attacking him, and then I use the stubby leash the rest of that walk. Or the stubby leash when in hotels that require the dog to be on a physical leash. \n\n\nThis takes way more work to build and maintain a verbal leash than most people are willing to put the effort in.", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

But it's not something the mom should be able to demand.", "Like I said he\u2019s 3 years old\u2026they\u2019re never around dogs\u2026all she can do is try to teach him when they are around them. Just like spiders, snakes, or anything else. Like I said it\u2019s not a phobia he won\u2019t have a heart attack being uncomfortable around dogs which is okay if he is never comfortable around them. As an adult I\u2019m cautious around animals and teach my children to do so as well because anything can happen. I\u2019m not delusional that all animals are friendly because even friendly ones turn. And also depending on the type of dog owner you come across you need to be careful of even being okay with the dog being around your small child", "okay? and if kids are scared of dogs for ANY reason dog owners need to respect that. a playground is a safe place for kids to PLAY. dogs can go play in dog parks.", ">They were all having a good time.\n\nNot OP's son who kept running back to her every time the dog got close to him since he's not used to dogs yet. \n\nIf this would have happened at the dog park, OP would be in the wrong but it happened on the playground meant for kids!  OP is NTA! \n\nYou mentioned that where you live, there are no rules that forbid dogs from playgrounds. Where I  live dogs are forbidden to enter playgrounds and most are fenced in! Dogs allowed or not on the playgrounds, the guy should have kept his dog on a leash!", "Unless there are signs then dogs are permitted and may only be required to be \"under control\" which it sounds like this one was.\n\nDogs and kids are good for one another!", "Unless like in the playgrounds where I live they aren\u2019t allowed in the area and can be fined.", "The dog wasn\u2019t hurting anyone yet. Kids can be unpredictable around dogs and scare/hurt them leading to the dog lashing out. Even the most well behaved dog has limits. That is just natural. \n\nSo it was as much a matter of protecting the dog as it was assuring the fears of the kid. A responsible dog owner would have the dog within reach while playing and at least stop him from approaching kids on his own. \n\nAt the end of the day it is the life\u2019s of both kid and dog which can be in danger in worst case, just because the owner thought their dog should have unsecured fun on a playground with young kids around.\n\nETA: the same would apply to parents with young kids on the loose in a dog park/playground. Just role reversed.", "where I live, dogs aren't technically allowed off leash anywhere but at a dog park. people do it, but if it's bothering someone like in the case here, it's common courtesy to leash your dog. I agree with you that it'd probably be good for OPs son to be exposed to dogs at some point so he's not afraid every time he sees one, but that's not going to be accomplished in the half an hour they were at the park.", "exactly just like they were around this dog in a public place. They could have sat the child down and from a far talked about \"look how much fun the dog is having\", \"he seems to like children\", \"look that kid is playing with him\", while reassuring the child that they don't need to go near the dog. Just up and leaving when there is a dog is only going to reenforce that dogs shouldn't be interacted with.", "I also didn't say that all animals are friendly. Learning to understand the basics of animals you live around without panicking is an important part of life. People who live on farms or near wildlife learn this early on.\n\nIf you live in a city or suburbs, dogs are going to be around you all the time. If you go into a blind panic at the mere sight of one, you're in for a bad time. If you learn their basic behaviors, how to interact with them, and what signs to look for to tell if they're dangerous, you'll be much better off.", "\"Even friendly ones turn\"?

You seem weirdly afraid of animals, if anything.", ">this is obviously not a place especially for a large dog to play\n\nIf it\u2019s not relevant, don\u2019t bring it up.

And she said it wasn't leashed. That's being an irresponsible dog owner.", "I understand that, but it's poor etiquette to let your dog keep hanging around a kid that doesn't want to be around it. If the dog was on a leash the situation could've been much better for all parties. No matter how well behaved a dog is, when around children, it should most likely stay on a leash.", "Yep same here.

I have had both dogs and kids for 48 years now, and no kid has ever been hurt. \n\nThat's not to say that some dogs can't handle kids.

It can and does happen. One of my aunts still has physical scars from the family dog suddenly turning on her when she was about five or so. They\u2019d had him for years and he\u2019d been a perfectly normal, friendly dog up until that moment. It wasn\u2019t anything out of routine either- she was just saying goodnight to him like she always did. Point is, it happens and you have to be careful with kids around dogs", "Weirdly afraid of animals because I am a cautious parent? Okay go off\ud83d\ude44", "playgrounds are not places for dogs to play when there are kids using the equipped whats so hard to understand that? lmao. i like dogs but playgrounds arent dog parks. its not hard to get. no matter the size of dogs. children cant help being scared of dogs either.", "I think that\u2019s irrelevant! Where I live regardless of no harm being done, if the Park warden catches you with your dog in the cordoned off play park, you will be fined.", "Not normally I agree. But I wasn\u2019t talking about normally but rather dog boundary crossing behavior by the kid. \n\nYour dogs and kids were probably trained by you and knew to behave around each other.

There are 25,000 people killed a year by dogs (which I know is a small percentage of dogs).

I don't mind downvotes but if a dog becomes aggressive out of nowhere, it's more likely there's a reason than it just.. \"turning\".  That's ridiculous.\n\nEdit: I am sorry about your aunt.  I've been bitten by a dog, shit sucks.  But anecdotal evidence is just silly.", "Hear me out, dude.  You said she should teach him when he is around them, because he's not usually.  But he was around one.  And what she taught him was nothing.  Golden opportunity, right there.   Talk to the owner, keeping the kid with her, safe, and introduce them and show him, with other kids around that are playing with the friendly pup, that dogs are okay.  Instead of... enabling her stifling behavior?", "Ok. And? I don\u2019t know who you\u2019re arguing with dude.", "Where I live there are no rules against dogs in parks.", "According to OP, dog and kids were playing peacefully.\n\nThink about it.  Your kids are having fun at the playground, and a new kids mom wants you to stop doing what you're doing.    Not fair, IMO", "It apparently had a brain tumour, which they found out about after it had died. Unfortunately that is a reason you cannot see. It is absolutely important to remain careful with children around animals, and I say that as a dog owner", "First I\u2019m not a dude..it\u2019s my sons nickname\nAs a mother she encouraged him to go then he came back crying again when the dog came by him and the dog owner saw this. Do I agree that she should\u2019ve approached the dog owner better, yes I do because there was nothing saying they can\u2019t be there. But No matter what way you twist this the dog should\u2019ve been on a leash. Small children like that don\u2019t know boundaries and could\u2019ve easily set off the dog. And regardless the dog should not have been on the equipment with the children..that\u2019s asking for disaster to happen. I\u2019m sorry but in this situation you become more of a realistic cautious parent than putting your kid in that situation with this particular dog. If they were just walking by and he got scared yes she could have reassured him that he wasnt in danger.", "i am not arguing. theres a difference of pointing out facts vs arguing. i hope you get how playgrounds arent for dogs either way. have a good day! you also came into my replies first.", "That was my point, dude?  Dogs don't just turn, there's a reason?  I was defending that point and the dude that suggested the kid get more comfortable with dogs, instead of living in fear of animals like his mom?  Animals aren't just crazy and do shit for no reason?", "Nah, dude.  She never encouraged anything, you're inferring something from nothing.  You're also implying leash laws.  You're also implying the dog is improperly trained or that the owner wasn't aware of what his dog was doing.  You're inferring a lot.", "Whoever keeps upvoting me, you're a real one lol.
