Why can't they have the party for her friend on another night? Or at the very least, offer to alternate years or something?", "NTA, not your friend group, not your headache", "NTA\n\nAn invite can be turned down, you have different ways of celebrating her birthday. You would rather do your own plans and not be dragged to her party (by your wife).\n\nIt's absurd to spent your birthday with everyone else born in the same day & give up on your way to spent it just because they might be upset.", "NTA. You get to celebrate your birthday with the people who make you happy.", "NTA - You are allowed to want your birthday to be about you. And that is a shit feeling when people celebrate others and not you (had that happen once). I really hope your wife sees what you are saying and understands.", "NAH, but cant you do something another night?", " NAH- It\u2019s not like you owe them anything to go. Would be nice if they put a little more effort for yours but you have to understand that it\u2019s for the friends in the friend group and it doesn\u2019t seem like you\u2019re mainly part of it. :/", "nta, frankly your wife sucks. She married YOU not her friend or friends. YOU should be the priority to her on your birthday. To elaborate on my comment, the OP does mention that he told his wife \" told her it really bummed me out to go to an event like that and to see everyone so enthusiastically celebrating her friend, and just have my birthday be a matter of courtesy\", which tells me it was an afterthought, a \"oh yeah happy birthday\". Wife should celebrate his birthday with people he likes.", "NTA - you should be her priority, and chances are you have been overly accommodating and she has tried to have it both ways while likely ignoring the reality that you were being put last.\n\nMy older son has the same birthday as my niece who is 4 years older than him. Starting out we went to their house and co-celebrated, then had multiple parties because my parents would always favor the niece over our son ... and eventually just stopped putting our kid second (and as a kid, all he knew was he got multiple parties and multiple cakes every year).", "YTA. It's fine if you don't want to go, but at the same time it sounds like your wife's friends have big and well put together parties because they put the time and effort into planning them, which you do not. You expect the same level of party without putting in any of the effort? Plan your own party if you want to be the center of attention.", "Ideally I would like to go to a bar with some of my friends or just go to a nice dinner with my wife. I have expressed to my wife that next year for my 30th I would like a real party of some kind, but this year I'd like to keep it low key. It's not necessarily that I want to have a big celebration. \n\nIt's just I have had a lot of disappointing birthdays in my past (planned a dinner with friends and no one came, my gf at one time didn't make the 30 minute drive to celebrate with me because she had to study, my parents didn't get me anything for my 16th after throwing my sister 2 sweet 16s... etc.), and when I celebrate with her friends on my birthday it kinda reminds me of my past bad experiences and makes me feel that I am not enough of a priority to anyone for them to want to celebrate mine. a bit overdramatic I know, and something I'm working on in therapy, but just something I would like to not have to think about on my birthday.", "and it sounds like the wife is not making him very happy. I think they need to have a serious talk about priorities.", "Can't they?", "How did you come to that conclusion? He says they make a big deal out of them to indicate why the wife goes out with her friends instead of him being able to celebrate with his.\n\nHe shouldn\u2019t be required to spend his birthday at a party for someone else. \n\nOP, I recommend you tell her to that you\u2019re planning something different for yourself and if she chooses the friends over you then you know where you stand and can make of it what you will. \n\nNTA", "Lol, how are you getting \"wants a party and to be the center of attention but refuses to plan it himself\" out of \"doesn't want to go to their party this year\"?", "I read that a little differently, what i read was he didn't want to spend time with a bunch of people he wasn't really friends with and celebrate someone elses birthday, and the only reason he is there is because of his wife. I don't think its unreasonable for him to expect just him, his wife and HIS friends on HIS birthday now and then. Though its on him to articulate that to her.", "You might want to add this to your post, it helps explain why you seem both interested and uninterested in birthday celebrations. \n\nCould a low key celebration this year be a meal or something on another night? That way your wife can go to her friend's event and you can decide to go or not. It does come across like your main goal at the moment is to stop your wife celebrating with her friends.", "Just to clarify a bit, my wife was very understanding of my response. She is just not that into birthdays, and she does try to celebrate it with me however I want, but she just does not understand it. She has had bad experiences in the past, and has never been interested in celebrating her birthdays, so she doesn't actively think about celebrations. I have had a very calm and good talk with her about how I do with that there was more emphasis on my birthdays, and she has promised to do better. But she does not prioritize the friend's bday over mine", "Why would they? They are not the husband friends...", "> He says they make a big deal out of them to indicate why the wife goes out with her friends instead of him being able to celebrate with his.\n\nBirthday parties don't have to literally be on your exact birthday... have one the weekend before or the weekend after. The wife is \"choosing\" her friend over her husband because her husband is not even attempting to plan a party of his own. No need to create a problem where none exists.", "That\u2019s good to hear. NAH (especially if no one suggested you were an asshole for not going or not being appreciative).", "That really does put a different spin on it. I'm a lot like your wife, for me its a demeaning insulting reminder of all I have managed to NOT accomplish.", "They want his wife there, surely he should be her priority on that day now and then? You're right though, so its up to her to say \"hey guys....\"", "As far as i know, most people don't plan their own birthday party. You're not wong about the weekend before or after, or the day after or before. Hell a few times in my family we celebrated a few weeks after, mostly because we all forgot lol. (Yes even the birthday person. We also forgot our ages...).", "Ask any woman who is into birthdays about who does the majority of the planning for their party and you might be very surprised - there's a reason that women tend to have well planned events and men tend to not", "Does a birthday need to be an event? Why not just enjoy the time with the people you care about on your birthday?", "Nta, arrange what you want for your birthday. Just remember that some joint friends may go to the other party so get your invites out early and don't get p,d off if they rsvp no. \n\nIf your so isn't into party's, plan and book your own, give her clear requests for any help/ presents etc that you ask her to do. \" honey it would be really great if you can arrange a birthday cake for my party. Would you do that?\"  \"yes! great I would love a red velvet cake with my name and big sparkler. It needs to be big enough for 30 people.\" \"No! That's fine I can do it myself, is there anything else you would like to help me with instead?\"\n\nEither way, stay chilled and I hope you have  Better time this year.", "I mean, that sounds strange -- why would they put off celebrating the friend's birthday?  OP should certainly give it a miss, though, and it sounds like they miss plenty of other birthdays, so it shouldn't be a big deal.", "How does the wife sound over bearing?", "Wife's friends, not wife.", "Man, one more good reason not to go to the other party, an hour away!\n\nHappy birthday, NTA.", "Well he directly says that his birthday is only acknowledged at the party as a \"courtesy\" and that's the reason he doesn't want to go. If he wants it to be more than a courtesy, he should throw his own party. Idk what he expects going to a party that he did not plan with people who are not his friends.\n\nAgain, not an issue if he doesn't want to go. But he's playing it off as him not getting enough attention, which is a problem thats easy to solve.", "Gotcha. I missed that the first time and was confused lol.", "But that doesn't mean he wants a party.\nMaybe he just wants one birthday where the focus is not on someone else. That doesn't mean he wants a party.\n\nJust seems like a huge stretch to call him an asshole for wanting someone to pay attention to him on his birthday but isn't willing to throw a party for himself, when we don't know if he wants a party.\n\nMaybe just a simple dinner with his wife on his birthday is all he wants.", "info: is there a problem? you said your wife actually agrees with you in the comments. so, are the friends complaining? what would you be TA for?", "NTA. It sounds like you've been receiving second-hand birthdays. Does your wife have no problem with this?", "NTA. Don't go to any. You shouldn't have to. OK. Maybe once in a while for your wife but you really should be like, nope. Have a good night. Plus your birthday should be a priority to your wife over her friend's bday.", "NTa. Why would your wife even think this was ok.", "NTA\n\nProbably your wife wants to party with her friends, so she asks her friends to include you in the friend\u2019s celebration so she can go", "Nta", "Who is his wife married to?", "That's a huge jump from anything he said?", "Just crawling closer to death.", "\"Another year older /\nAnd one day closer to death.\"", "NAH. \n\nI share a birthday with my mom and my SIL. Sometimes I want to just celebrate my own way, but it's usually not possible. \n\nCelebrate the way you want.", "NTA. you didn't make a fuss. you didn't explode at them mid party or something. you spoke to your wife, explained your reasons and pretty much acted like an adult.", "NAH\n\nIt doesn't sound like they celebrate other spouses birthdays so it makes sense that it's mainly about their friend. That being said they probably try to include you for two reasons. \n\n1. Like you said to be nice\n2. Because your wife likely won't want to ditch you on your birthday\n\nI think it's fine to opt out as long as your aren't rude which it doesn't sound like you were/are.", "NTA", "NTA"]}
