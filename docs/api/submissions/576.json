Have you let him know you won't accept his behavior anymore and if he keeps it up you won't drive?

I was taking public transportation before I was 17 years old. If his family gives you a hard time, that's not the family you want to be around for the rest of your life.", "NTA never do another thing for the entitled brat.", "**NTA**\n\nThere is being polite and being a doormat - you are the latter . Cousin needs a lesson in humility and basic human decency.\n\nWatch for his shocked Pikachu face when you say No to everything. \n\nDepending on how far away gfs parents house is you can either leave him there or give him a ride to the nearest bus stop.", "NTA. Take him home this last time and no longer entertain taking him anywhere.  This way you won't have his people on your back.", "Not seeing any info on how the GF is reacting to this disrespect, has she told him to cool it?  If you like whatever the final destination is for him, home or your GFs house you could stop 5 miles from the end and tell him how you feel and say the free rides are over.  Then finish the last 5 miles and be done with it.  This way he'd have to listen to you and not just bolt out of the car if you made it to the house.  But don't strand him, just let him know in 5 miles the rides are over.", "YTA. It would be irresponsible on your part to stop driving him to his house. Your girlfriend trusted you on this and his little attempts to demean you shouldn't have any effect on you. Just think of it as a tantrum and don't pay any attention to him, he'll most likely drop it after a while. Plus, he probably is only overreacting because he feels like you're an intruder and stealing your girlfriend from him and her family, I think he's being possessive and kind of petty.", "Yeah I really want too but don\u2019t want her family to go crazy on me since he is a minor. There is a bus to town and I could give him some money to pay for the ticket.", "I second this.", "Well he would be at his uncles house at least. Gas is expensive and I don\u2019t want to drive someone like that on my time. But probably the best decision to avoid things like this. Be the bigger person I suppose.", "Can't they take him where he needs to go?  Why would you pay his ticket?  \n\nOr if it will really cause that much trouble and whatever, just take him home this last time and then never take him anywhere again.  (I mean never, no matter what he says.  The kid is an entitled AH.)", "How safe is it in the area he would be catching the bus? He's certainly close enough to adulthood that the bus shouldn't be a problem, but I'd be wary of leaving anyone young to wait for a bus if it's not a great part of town or very late at night.", "Just take him home in don\u2019t pick him back up again.", "Might just take him home for the last time. God making me think twice on having kids in the future."]}
