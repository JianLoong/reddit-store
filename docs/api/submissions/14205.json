Absolutly not saying that that is how your son felt but as others have suggested you should talk to him about it because there might come a time when he is not comfortable with this.

I do think 13 is a little old to be undressing him due to puberty and the fact that he\u2019s capable of removing his own clothes in the night if he gets uncomfortable, but I don\u2019t think you were wrong.

I have a 13 ur old son and he wouldn't mind if I took his shirt off while he was sleeping and or his socks cuz he's a hot and sweaty sleeper and if the were extenuating circumstances he'd probably be fine with me taking his pants off too. I know for a fact he'd not appreciate me touching or taking of his underpants.

Nurse here and i have questions! Had this happened before? Has a doctor diagnosed his headaches? Is he on treatment? A sudden really bad headache that makes him unable to take his clothes off and makes him excessively sleepy needs a trip to the ER!

Although we don't have the info to say for sure, I'd bet on either cluster headache or migraine if it lasted longer than that.", "I\u2019d say just talk to your son and see how he feels about it - at 13 he\u2019s more than old enough to set his own boundaries around this kind of stuff.\n\nMaybe say \u2018I thought I was doing the right thing, but your mum pointed out it might have made you uncomfortable. What do you think?\u2019\n\nWe can all, as parents, have those moments when we realise we\u2019re treating our kids as younger than they are, and we now have to make an adjustment to a new stage.

Like you took his sweatshirt off or stripped him buck naked? Definitely wouldn\u2019t say you\u2019re the TA over it. But just to delve into your reasoning, why were you so intent on getting his clothes off? What\u2019s the harm in just letting him sleep the migraine off in his clothes for one night? He\u2019s old enough that he can handle that kinda thing imo. I get you were likely just trying to get him comfy and tuck him in, but I think he\u2019s probably getting a little old for such intimate care. Not saying you did something wrong, just that it seems unnecessary and overboard to me, assuming you stripped him down to his underwear. He\u2019s a teen now. So NTA, but you may wanna reconsider that kinda thing moving forward. Just food for thought. You can talk to your son about it if you\u2019re really worried, see how he feels about it. But I\u2019d probably just phase out that level of care if I were you.

That\u2019s HIS SON", "i, too, thought it was a weird cultural thing. i'm not from the usa (which is where i assume op and most commenters are from?), and i can't imagine anyone making such a huge deal out of this situation where i live, especially since both the parent and the kid are of the same gender.", "Hes his dad", "Sound like mom wants to respect her child's privacy and right to consent to being touched.", "Should it be different though? A loving parent is a loving parent.", "It could be hormonal? I developed severe migraines at the same age which phased out towards the end of my teens. Never had one since (I'm 38 now). I am female though so I don't know if boy hormones do the same thing.", "disagree, at 13 I would not have liked my mom or dad undressing me in the slightest. It'd feel like an invasion of my privacy like mom in the OP noted.\n\nSleeping in your clothes won't kill you.", "Yeah, it depends on the child really - I have one a similar age who doesn't care at all if we help them undress and into PJ's if they're really tired, and appreciates the help,whereas the younger one already prefers more privacy and I can see them not wanting that when they're older.", "Yeah if it was me and my mom when I was that age I would probably just have thanked her and gone to bed.

Kids usually reach a point in life where they no longer want to be seen nude at all and where it becomes a very sensitive topic.\n\nAt 13 I already was at that period of my life, I felt immense shame having to undress with my mother nearby. Which was made even worse by her always being very care-free about it, loudly wondering why I'd suddenly make such a fuss trying out the new pants in front of her.\nJust because it's his son doesn't automatically make it ok for his son.

I would have been very creeped out at that age, not knowing what my parents had seen while I was sleeping.", "Yep, i think its a usa thing too", "True, but at 13 puberty causes a slight change in the dynamic. I would not undress my 13yr old children except for shoes unless they were in stiff clothes like formal-wear, button-down, or other tight clothes. I have both boys and girls. But, I think OP felt differently and I think that's okay.", "I also got my migraines as a boy in my teens, they stil happen though. I tend to notice auras first though, which gives me time to nuke my brain with ibuprofen and paracetamol before pain hits.", "I think you feel this way only because of the distress your mother caused you. If you didnt have precedents, this happening once when you dont have precedents wouldnt be a problem. Its also the father, here, not the mother, which does make a difference, imo", "I think it depends on the child, my 12 yr old son came downstairs in his underwear last night to get something from the living room so I don't think he'd care. Op should just have a chat with his son and see how he feels about it.", "Yeah, I wouldn\u2019t strip a child that age of mine naked. To me taking off some jeans and leaving them in boxers is no more naked than they\u2019d be in swimwear or pajamas though.", "As someone who\u2019s mother did not cause them distress, I agree with the other commenter. Sometimes 13 year olds just don\u2019t want to be seen in states of partial undress. There\u2019s nothing inherently weird about him undressing his son but there\u2019s also nothing unusual about his son finding it uncomfortable (not saying that his son did- he was asleep so we obviously just don\u2019t know)", "I definitely wouldn't have wanted my mother to undress me while I was unconscious at age 13.

It doesn't even have to do with your actions being viewed as sexually predatory.\nIt is just wrong in general.

It's not like he's unconcious, in danger or soiled himself. \nDifferent topic: Does your child have these pains oftem or is it the first time? Has he been diagnosed with migane or anything?

Symptoms like your describe are seek medical attention symptoms! But yeah I feel like 13 is really pushing the age you can undress your kids.

For my older teen it would be no issue at all, for my thirteen year old it would be incredibly intrusive and he'd hate it. \n\nAssuming your kid isn't bothered about nudity/ you left his pants on NTA.\n\nBut that headache sounds a bit scary. I was a bit surprised the story was about you going home rather than taking him to hospital.", "NTA but I feel like you should probably talk to your son about if he's comfortable or not with it. Like personally j think at that age I would have been okay with my parents just taking off my shoes and any necklace/glasses I had on. Anything more I feel like is unnecessary.

I think I would be a lot more concerned about my 13 year old having headaches so bad they bury their face in pillows, begs to go home and can't function. But you only concern is his father undressing him so he's more comfortable while sleeping through the headache episode.

Just where do your priorities lye???", "I\u2019m actually gonna give an opinion from the other side and say YTA.\n\nI know for a fact when I was 13, if one of my parents did this to me whilst I was sleeping without my consent I\u2019d feel totally violated.

I have a no outside clothes in the bed policy, it\u2019s gross so I\u2019m on your side.

I have epilepsy and whenever I\u2019ve had seizures, my mom has had to help me shower, get dressed, use the restroom, and many other things until I\u2019m fully aware of my surroundings. It\u2019s not weird or inappropriate for a parent (preferably same-sex) to help their sick/hurting child. I couldn\u2019t have done it on my own and needed her help. I believe it was similar for your son. He was hurting and needed to get changed, but he wasn\u2019t feeling well.

Shows more about her than you.", "It really depends... you can have a 13 year old who still believes in Santa and is 100% comfortable and expects to be treated like an adolescent still so this is fine, and another 13 year old who has graduated fully into teenager mode and is absolutely protective of all the privacy and independence they can hold on to and everything in between.\n\nYou gotta ask the kid directly to know where he falls. \n\nIf he was that sick he probably didn't realize or care.

That's why YTA, not for undressing him.", "NTA. What I find weird is that your son has a massive crippling migraine out of nowhere and instead of taking him to the emergency room you take him home and put him to bed and your wife\u2019s biggest concern is that you undressed him and tucked him into bed.", "The real question is, are these headaches common? Have they happened before? Rapid onset of severe pain would have me either taking him to Emergency, or to the doctors as soon as they opened. Mind you, I'm in Australia, we have social health care. Surely if he's too unwell to undress himself he needs medical attention?", "YTA. He's 13, not 6. It's super weird to undress your 13yo.

I think I would have been very angry, if I really have to say the truth,I wouldn't have taken it well at all.\n\nHowever, 12-14 is that very, very personal phase of pre/early puberty and teenagehood. A lot of teenagers seem having 5 years of difference despite being of the same age. It's very varying. You have people who are still children and some who are basically adults (or at least, they think so)... and everything in between. The bodies can be completely different and cause huge embarrassment... or not.\n\nIt really depends. In any case, I'm pretty sure the mother isn't \"sexualising\" this event but showing a quite reasonable concern (probably thinking about her own puberty). So I wouldn't imply something weird about her behaviour: I genuinely think she was just worried because she really thinks that, in her son shoes, she wouldn't have liked it.
