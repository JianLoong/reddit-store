Sounds like you just wanted him to be as comfortable as possible when he was sick. Personally, I'd appreciate that kind of care (though, as a female, it'd only be appropriate for my mom to do this for me), especially considering you just came back from a family dinner. The clothing he was wearing couldn't possibly be anything comfortable to sleep in. Plus, don't most guys prefer to sleep in their boxers? You were just trying to help him be as comfortable as possible while he wasn't feeling well. Wouldn't hurt to mention what happened, but I don't see any need for an apology.

It is nothing wrong with doing this if that is the relationship you have and he is okey with it. However i would like to point out that some people would be extremely uncomfortable with (i personally would have felt extremely violeted if my parents did this to me at that age). Absolutly not saying that that is how your son felt but as others have suggested you should talk to him about it because there might come a time when he is not comfortable with this. You sound like a good dad with a good relationship to your son so you can probably have a good conversation about were he can feel heard, cared for and respected, especially now when he is a teenager and might be going through changes that might alter  what he feels comfortable with.", "YTA. Consent and privacy are very important. It wasn't going to hurt him to sleep in his clothes.", "NTA, it sounds like OP's wife overreacted.

I completely agree with your wife on this one. \n\nI don\u2019t think your intention was to be weird, it\u2019s parental instinct to want to take care of your sick kid\u2026 but it\u2019s also important to take a step back and give our kids the right to privacy, especially once they\u2019re past the age of bathing themselves yk? \n\nSick or not, it\u2019s not gonna kill him to sleep in a pair of jeans for the night.", "NTA", "NTA.

Now, if your son talks to you about this and is an issue. Apologize for overstepping and state how you were just trying to help while he was sick. If anything, I would think your wife is escalating things and turning it into a weird thing, but I could be in the wrong too.", "NTA. It would be a little different if it was mom and not dad. But, if he was in that much pain, he probably appreciated the care and support more than any weirdness.", "YTA. WTF are you thinking of? Yes, take his shoes off and make sure there is nothing that could choke him but just make sure he is comfortable and put a blanket over him if you think he might be cold. But actually undressing him without consent when there is no obvious reason to do so? I would consider that sexual assault.", "Nta for getting him comfy. \n\nAbsolutely neglecting him for not taking him to a&e.", "NTA, but your wife is creepy for even twisting the situation in that manner. She definitely sexualized it and felt guilty and decided to take it out on you l", "I've passed out in bed with migranes and never cared if I had day clothes or pjs on, so I think undressing him was unecessary. BUT I don't think it was necessarily wrong either. It wouldn't hurt to check in with him, once his existence stops being pain, and make sure it didn't bother him. If it doesn't, then no big deal and if it does \"Ok, sorry I won't do that next time\" easy peasy.\n\nKids grow so fast it's really easy to forget their boundaries can change just as quickly, so this is really just a simple boundary check-in and not a big deal either way.", "NTA you were caring for your son by making sure he was comfortable. \nYour wife is weird for making this an issue.", "NAH personally, taking off shoes is enough given the circumstances. But a father undressing a teenage sin down to underwear is fine.", "NTA \n\nIf he wasn't sick, migraine perhaps?, then it would be an invasion but since he was sick it was just trying to make your child comfortable. And having dad do it is much less of an invasion of privacy than if mom had. \n\nYou were just patenting a sick child, your wife is riding a high horse to no where", "I\u2019m not going to give a judgement because this is the kind of thing that depends entirely on how your son feels about it. \n\nYour wife overreacted although I understand her perspective. I do think 13 is a little old to be undressing him due to puberty and the fact that he\u2019s capable of removing his own clothes in the night if he gets uncomfortable, but I don\u2019t think you were wrong. You were trying to make him comfortable. \n\nHave a word with your son and find out how he feels. If he didn\u2019t mind, cool. If he did, apologise and respect his privacy going forward.", "This sounds like migraine. From my own experience, clothes are torture in this szenario. NTA", "NTA though it rlly depends how undressed you got him. I have a 13 ur old son and he wouldn't mind if I took his shirt off while he was sleeping and or his socks cuz he's a hot and sweaty sleeper and if the were extenuating circumstances he'd probably be fine with me taking his pants off too. I know for a fact he'd not appreciate me touching or taking of his underpants. So I wouldn't unless there was some kind of legit emergency that involved taking them off (?).   \n\nBut really what is the big deal of staying in his clothes for one night when sick? Just change the sheets after he feels better", "Clothing issues aside, were neither one of you that concerned over the sudden onset severe headache causing dizziness? That should have been your first concern, not his clothing.", "He would have been fine in his clothes; he clearly didn't care.", "Yea a sudden onset of a head ache that severe with those associated symptoms has me worried.", "This! Nurse here and i have questions! Had this happened before? Has a doctor diagnosed his headaches? Is he on treatment? A sudden really bad headache that makes him unable to take his clothes off and makes him excessively sleepy needs a trip to the ER! I work in tele health and I would've sent an ambulance.", "It's less likely for a male his age, but cluster headaches kind of sound like this. They are sudden and one attack can last for 3-4 hours. The pain is super intense. When I had my bout a few years ago all I could do is lay in the fetal position until it passed. Although we don't have the info to say for sure, I'd bet on either cluster headache or migraine if it lasted longer than that.", "I\u2019d say just talk to your son and see how he feels about it - at 13 he\u2019s more than old enough to set his own boundaries around this kind of stuff.\n\nMaybe say \u2018I thought I was doing the right thing, but your mum pointed out it might have made you uncomfortable. What do you think?\u2019\n\nWe can all, as parents, have those moments when we realise we\u2019re treating our kids as younger than they are, and we now have to make an adjustment to a new stage. Let your kid take the lead on bodily autonomy.", "Yeah, mom sexualized that.", "At 13 years old? Idk.. how far \u201cundressed\u201d are we talking here OP? Like you took his sweatshirt off or stripped him buck naked? Definitely wouldn\u2019t say you\u2019re the TA over it. But just to delve into your reasoning, why were you so intent on getting his clothes off? What\u2019s the harm in just letting him sleep the migraine off in his clothes for one night? He\u2019s old enough that he can handle that kinda thing imo. I get you were likely just trying to get him comfy and tuck him in, but I think he\u2019s probably getting a little old for such intimate care. Not saying you did something wrong, just that it seems unnecessary and overboard to me, assuming you stripped him down to his underwear. He\u2019s a teen now. So NTA, but you may wanna reconsider that kinda thing moving forward. Just food for thought. You can talk to your son about it if you\u2019re really worried, see how he feels about it. But I\u2019d probably just phase out that level of care if I were you. Sounds like what your son really needs is to see a doctor, not help getting his pants off.", "At 13 yrs old no not standard at all if it is there is something wrong,", "yeah that's what I was thinking", "This exactly!", "That's kind of where I'm at too.

That\u2019s HIS SON", "i, too, thought it was a weird cultural thing. i'm not from the usa (which is where i assume op and most commenters are from?), and i can't imagine anyone making such a huge deal out of this situation where i live, especially since both the parent and the kid are of the same gender.", "Hes his dad", "Sound like mom wants to respect her child's privacy and right to consent to being touched.", "Should it be different though? A loving parent is a loving parent.", "It could be hormonal? I developed severe migraines at the same age which phased out towards the end of my teens. Never had one since (I'm 38 now). I am female though so I don't know if boy hormones do the same thing.", "disagree, at 13 I would not have liked my mom or dad undressing me in the slightest. It'd feel like an invasion of my privacy like mom in the OP noted.\n\nSleeping in your clothes won't kill you.", "Yeah, it depends on the child really - I have one a similar age who doesn't care at all if we help them undress and into PJ's if they're really tired, and appreciates the help,whereas the younger one already prefers more privacy and I can see them not wanting that when they're older.", "Yeah if it was me and my mom when I was that age I would probably just have thanked her and gone to bed.

Kids usually reach a point in life where they no longer want to be seen nude at all and where it becomes a very sensitive topic.\n\nAt 13 I already was at that period of my life, I felt immense shame having to undress with my mother nearby. Which was made even worse by her always being very care-free about it, loudly wondering why I'd suddenly make such a fuss trying out the new pants in front of her.\nJust because it's his son doesn't automatically make it ok for his son. But in this case, he knew him well enough so that it wasn't an issue. I would have been very creeped out at that age, not knowing what my parents had seen while I was sleeping.", "Yep, i think its a usa thing too", "True, but at 13 puberty causes a slight change in the dynamic. I would not undress my 13yr old children except for shoes unless they were in stiff clothes like formal-wear, button-down, or other tight clothes. I have both boys and girls. But, I think OP felt differently and I think that's okay.", "I also got my migraines as a boy in my teens, they stil happen though. I tend to notice auras first though, which gives me time to nuke my brain with ibuprofen and paracetamol before pain hits.", "I think you feel this way only because of the distress your mother caused you. If you didnt have precedents, this happening once when you dont have precedents wouldnt be a problem. Its also the father, here, not the mother, which does make a difference, imo", "I think it depends on the child, my 12 yr old son came downstairs in his underwear last night to get something from the living room so I don't think he'd care. Op should just have a chat with his son and see how he feels about it.", "Yeah, I wouldn\u2019t strip a child that age of mine naked. To me taking off some jeans and leaving them in boxers is no more naked than they\u2019d be in swimwear or pajamas though.", "As someone who\u2019s mother did not cause them distress, I agree with the other commenter. Sometimes 13 year olds just don\u2019t want to be seen in states of partial undress. There\u2019s nothing inherently weird about him undressing his son but there\u2019s also nothing unusual about his son finding it uncomfortable (not saying that his son did- he was asleep so we obviously just don\u2019t know)", "I definitely wouldn't have wanted my mother to undress me while I was unconscious at age 13. You cant just assume a 13 year old would be okay with that.", "Absolutely, i just find it weird to make it a problem by the mother when the son didnt even blink", "I can and i do lol. Your culture is different from mine"]}
