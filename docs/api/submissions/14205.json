Absolutly not saying that that is how your son felt but as others have suggested you should talk to him about it because there might come a time when he is not comfortable with this.

I do think 13 is a little old to be undressing him due to puberty and the fact that he\u2019s capable of removing his own clothes in the night if he gets uncomfortable, but I don\u2019t think you were wrong.

I have a 13 ur old son and he wouldn't mind if I took his shirt off while he was sleeping and or his socks cuz he's a hot and sweaty sleeper and if the were extenuating circumstances he'd probably be fine with me taking his pants off too. I know for a fact he'd not appreciate me touching or taking of his underpants.

Nurse here and i have questions! Had this happened before? Has a doctor diagnosed his headaches? Is he on treatment? A sudden really bad headache that makes him unable to take his clothes off and makes him excessively sleepy needs a trip to the ER!

Although we don't have the info to say for sure, I'd bet on either cluster headache or migraine if it lasted longer than that.", "I\u2019d say just talk to your son and see how he feels about it - at 13 he\u2019s more than old enough to set his own boundaries around this kind of stuff.\n\nMaybe say \u2018I thought I was doing the right thing, but your mum pointed out it might have made you uncomfortable. What do you think?\u2019\n\nWe can all, as parents, have those moments when we realise we\u2019re treating our kids as younger than they are, and we now have to make an adjustment to a new stage.

Like you took his sweatshirt off or stripped him buck naked? Definitely wouldn\u2019t say you\u2019re the TA over it. But just to delve into your reasoning, why were you so intent on getting his clothes off? What\u2019s the harm in just letting him sleep the migraine off in his clothes for one night? He\u2019s old enough that he can handle that kinda thing imo. I get you were likely just trying to get him comfy and tuck him in, but I think he\u2019s probably getting a little old for such intimate care. Not saying you did something wrong, just that it seems unnecessary and overboard to me, assuming you stripped him down to his underwear. He\u2019s a teen now. So NTA, but you may wanna reconsider that kinda thing moving forward. Just food for thought. You can talk to your son about it if you\u2019re really worried, see how he feels about it.

Kids usually reach a point in life where they no longer want to be seen nude at all and where it becomes a very sensitive topic.\n\nAt 13 I already was at that period of my life, I felt immense shame having to undress with my mother nearby.

But, I think OP felt differently and I think that's okay.", "I also got my migraines as a boy in my teens, they stil happen though. I tend to notice auras first though, which gives me time to nuke my brain with ibuprofen and paracetamol before pain hits.", "I think you feel this way only because of the distress your mother caused you. If you didnt have precedents, this happening once when you dont have precedents wouldnt be a problem. Its also the father, here, not the mother, which does make a difference, imo", "I think it depends on the child, my 12 yr old son came downstairs in his underwear last night to get something from the living room so I don't think he'd care. Op should just have a chat with his son and see how he feels about it.", "Yeah, I wouldn\u2019t strip a child that age of mine naked. To me taking off some jeans and leaving them in boxers is no more naked than they\u2019d be in swimwear or pajamas though.", "As someone who\u2019s mother did not cause them distress, I agree with the other commenter. Sometimes 13 year olds just don\u2019t want to be seen in states of partial undress.

It doesn't even have to do with your actions being viewed as sexually predatory.\nIt is just wrong in general.

It's not like he's unconcious, in danger or soiled himself. \nDifferent topic: Does your child have these pains oftem or is it the first time? Has he been diagnosed with migane or anything?

I think it\u2019s not inherently wrong or weird, and it sounds like this Dad is loving and if the kid said he has an issue dad would apologize and respect the boundary. Also, at 13 that kid almost certainly was aware of the undressing, you can\u2019t undress an teen or adult like you can a toddler and not have them wake up at all. I\u2019ve had bad migraines that put me to sleep for 14 hrs as a teen, if someone tried to take my pants off I would still wake up, heck if someone opened my door loud enough I\u2019d be aware of it.
