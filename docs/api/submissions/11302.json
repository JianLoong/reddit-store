In this scenario it might feel good to stand up for yourself, but it also wont do you any good. \n\nThis is one of those situations where you can get what you want, or you can be right but you can't have both.

Or you can get a good grade, by agreeing to the demands of a crazy person. \n\nOne of the hardest things that I had to learn is the phrase \"life is not fair\".  It can mean many things but the part that I struggled with is this very idea.  You can be correct, and still suffer.  Being right is not enough to get a good outcome and sometimes the wrong thing is the thing that is actually going to get you the furthest in life.\n\nWe all teach children about standing up for themselves because we don't want to create situations where others can just walk all over our kids needs and wants.  But there's also the opposite of that scenario where people stand up for themselves but it's that very act that actually causes them to suffer. \n\nYou are going to face situations in your life where your boss is an asshole, where you get pulled over by a cop who's a jerk, or even just wind up in a confrontation with someone who's bigger and stronger than you, but is also wrong.\n\nYOU need to look at each situation and decide what to do.  Do you stand up for yourself, or do you back down.  What's the right thing to do? What outcome do you really want out of this situation.\n\nThe way I look at this situation is this.

Universities need to be cognisant of the fact that they're taking in students from a wide variety of regions and cultures - punishing students for not knowing that an innocuous term in one region is offensive in another is somewhat ludicrous.", "Better than just a hamster on a wheel for some people ! Lol", "Idris Elba has had this happen in at least one interview and he's not the only one.", "I don't really think there is usually much in the way of 'punishment' for a one off however from what OP is indicating, this has been an ongoing issue and he has received warnings. That is indeed how academic integrity works.", "Idk if you\u2019re high school age but I was in high school last year and you\u2019re totally wrong", "I saw a meme recently that had a picture of Elba and Elon Musk. Underneath Idris Elba it said \"not African-American\" and then underneath Elon Musk it said \"African-American\" then under that the phrase \"we're begging you just call us Black\"", "A garbage truck and a dump truck are not even remotely the same thing", "you call it a garbage truck even if it isn't the truck used for the garbage? That seems confusing.", "Yeah I've heard it, but we always said \"dump truck of an ass\", not jist word for ass = dump truck. And you can't tell me that a word in extremely common usage for it's actual definition is only ever used 100% of the time as a coloquialism.", "But don't garbage trucks tilt to dump waste in the same way?", "When I hear dump truck, I think of the dump trucks used to bring sand to a job site. I'm not sure what else I'd call that truck.", "Canadian Gen Xer here, and a dump truck is absolutely a piece of construction equipment.  Using it as slang for a woman's anatomy must be very regional.", "Not saying they are, but where they are used pretty interchangeably around my area for whatever reason.", "My dad has been a truck driver for 3 decades so I've grown around truckers all my life, dump truck is definitely the term I always hear. I have never heard anyone call them garbage trucks as they are two very different types of trucks. \n\nIn my thirty years also having lived in the city I also never heard it used as a common slang for anything sexual.", "I was a kid in the 90s and boomers were big mad about that song.", "I live in Michigan and same, except that I do listen to \"boomer music\" from the 90's lol", "Boomers also don't listen to music from the 90s, so you and boomers have something in common. \n\nThe youngest boomers are 58. You are thinking of millennials and Gen X.", "Well you're just missing out then.", "Yeah, of course not. Nobody thinks that.", "Yes but they have a compactor function that makes them a garbage truck or officially \"refuse\" truck.", "That is exactly a dump truck. Basically rock haulers, sand and gravel. They can have some extra features but basically an open top truck for loading and a gated end for dumping with a lift function to empty.", "I mean one of my Dad's part-time, retirement jobs was driving a DUMP TRUCK for our big city airport they loaded snow into off the tarmac and DUMPED in an overflow lot. But okay... Long time truck driver too. \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb", "Right there with you", "I'm not trying to say that people in small towns are ignorant. I am saying that there are all kinds of regionalisms based on how people interact with the world.\n\nI lived most of my life in large cities. I really didn't think about where my trash went after a truck came by to pick it up. I lived in single-family homes, and if I had a very large item that needed to be picked up, like a sofa, I would call the city services to arrange for a special pick up.\n\nThen I moved to a smaller city where they do large item pickup twice a year. When I needed to throw away a large item outside of those two days, I drove my van to the dump.\n\nThere are towns in the US with under 100 people in them. I don't know how those people handle trash. Maybe the town contracts with a private company that sends a compactor truck around. Maybe they purchase services from their county. And maybe there is a truck that takes stuff to the dump, and for that reason they call a trash truck a dump truck."]}
