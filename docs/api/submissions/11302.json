In this scenario it might feel good to stand up for yourself, but it also wont do you any good. \n\nThis is one of those situations where you can get what you want, or you can be right but you can't have both.

Or you can get a good grade, by agreeing to the demands of a crazy person. \n\nOne of the hardest things that I had to learn is the phrase \"life is not fair\".  It can mean many things but the part that I struggled with is this very idea.  You can be correct, and still suffer.  Being right is not enough to get a good outcome and sometimes the wrong thing is the thing that is actually going to get you the furthest in life.\n\nWe all teach children about standing up for themselves because we don't want to create situations where others can just walk all over our kids needs and wants.  But there's also the opposite of that scenario where people stand up for themselves but it's that very act that actually causes them to suffer. \n\nYou are going to face situations in your life where your boss is an asshole, where you get pulled over by a cop who's a jerk, or even just wind up in a confrontation with someone who's bigger and stronger than you, but is also wrong.\n\nYOU need to look at each situation and decide what to do.  Do you stand up for yourself, or do you back down.  What's the right thing to do? What outcome do you really want out of this situation.\n\nThe way I look at this situation is this.
