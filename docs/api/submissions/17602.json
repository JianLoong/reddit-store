Sometimes that little bit of self care is the BEST thing we can do for our family, because it keeps us sane.\n\n It's not like you're staying away the entire time they are there... (right?

Have you talked to your husband about the screaming?", "ESH. I mean, kids are loud, some louder than others. It\u2019s really irritating, I get it. He should be better about making sure they understand how to control their volume, especially indoors.\n\nBut you chose to marry and have more kids with this man when you knew it was difficult for you to be in the house with his kids?

Kids are gonna kid, but you need to see what the hell he's doing that makes them scream and inevitably makes one of them cry.\n\nThere are ways for children to have fun that don't involve the treble hyena choir. Hubs needs to explore those. Also, screaming is an *outdoors* activity. You work with kids all day; expecting peace and quiet when you have three to five little ones at home is unrealistic, but on the other hand he's a total AH if he winds them up every time he plays with the kids.", "28!
