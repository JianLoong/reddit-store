So a few months ago while my friend, we'll call her S, F21, was planning her wedding she asked me, F20, to be one of her bridesmaids as we've been friends since middle school. I happily accepted it as she was my best friend despite not knowing the other bridesmaids either too well or at all, since we live apart so I don't hang out with her current friend group. Since I don't live near her I wasn't around when they went dress shopping and S asked me to get my own dress. I asked her if she was sure and she told me that all the bridesmaids dresses were different so it wouldn't matter, just that the dress had to be a blue dress. So I picked a gorgeous blue mermaid style dress and sent her a pic to ensure that it was fine. S told me that it was beautiful and was fine for me to use for the wedding.\nJumping to the day of the wedding I show up in the dress and meet with S who compliments my dress, though the other bridesmaids look at me in a judgemental manner. Then comes in the MOH, K, F21, who glares at me but doesn't say anything though I didn't pay too much attention. After the ceremony the MOH pulls me to the side and tells me I'm selfish and attention seeking for getting a fancy dress just as a bridesmaid when the MOH didn't have a fancy dress. The other bridesmaids agreed with her and we got into a little bit of an argument away from everyone as to not draw a scene about dresses. So I wanna know AITA?\nEdit to add to the story about the argument: it was basically the MOH trying to tell me that the bride didn't really want to approve the dress but she didn't want to make a fuss, though I feel like it might just be jealous lies by her but could also be believable because messaging me S did seem a bit hesitant. So after speaking with S, after posting this she did say she felt like I kinda overshadowed K and that she didn't know how fancy the dress was from the pic I sent her.", "created_utc": 1673398106, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/108qn9j/aita_for_showing_up_the_moh_at_my_friends_wedding/", "score": 176, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Let's just say Lexi is no longer my friend because it was supposed to be a simple wedding and she shows up in that ball gown", "The bride has commented below that a pic wasn\u2019t sent to her but that OP was meant to liaise with MOH regarding the dress.  Even so, the chosen dress (there\u2019s a pic in the thread below) is not one you\u2019d normally see bridesmaids in. OP looks lovely in it but it\u2019s an attention grabbing number and one which the bride said she felt outshined. \n\nSomebody somewhere is being disingenuous but I do think that OP missed the bridesmaid dress mark unfortunately.", "The bride okayed it.\n\nI wouldn't pick it for a bridesmaid dress.\n\nI do think you should have asked what the other bridesmaids were wearing and picked a style close to them.  But you got the greenliggt from the bride which is ultimately what matters.", "The fact she\u2019s saying you\u2019re probably not even the bride but can\u2019t even directly respond to this comment is just wow lol. I hope you were still able to enjoy your wedding day.", "Can you post a pic of you and all the bridesmaids together? Even if you crop of heads/faces. I have a feeling all other bridesmaids were in solid colored without sequin dresses and then OP shows up in Ms. USA evening wear.", "No she didn't.

That's what happens when you lie.\n\nBride is a real ah", "That commenter admitted they weren't the bride and were just fucking with people.\n\nAgree bridesmaid should have asked for photos of other bridesmaid dresses and gone similar.  Mermaid tends to be too fancy a style for bridesmaid dresses from what I've seen.  (Unless bride explicitly chooses it)", "Wasn't the rhe bride", "I say I'm like a manatee lol. Graceful in the water but a big blob out of it lol x", "She didn't. The bride is in the comments the lexi chick is an attention seeking liar\n She wants male redditors to send her dick pics because she is a pick me.", "How could you have  said it's a nice dress for a bride if you didn't even see the dress?", "The bride says in the comments she never even saw the dress.", "The poster lied. The bride didn\u2019t okay it. She didn\u2019t see the dress till her \u2018friend\u2019 showed up wearing it and decided not to make a fuss over her attention seeking bridesmaid. \n\nIt\u2019s starting to sound like K actually told OP that the dress was a poor choice because it was pretty much a ball gown (way more formal) and implied she was trying to distract from the bride.", "My thoughts exactly lol, I love posts where the person being talked about finds it and reveals extra details (not that I can ever find any)", "Did she? Where? After reading through everything it seems you have taken the word as gospel from one Redditor over another.", "Ouch. That caviat changes things a lot...", "It's the MOH or one of her minions.", "Everything you've said it you've never denied the claims though. You just adamantly shout it isn't S but you never once rebute the fact that you didn't send the picture. So did you or didn't you?", "Gathered thst from the last comment hence why I said I rescinded that part lol. \n\n\" Wow you know the fact that everyone took me up on facevalue that I was the bride is kinda hilarious but honestly I don't even know this girl, just figured I'd get a laugh out of it. \"", "Either way, lie or not. You still lo9ked stunning in thst dress. But i wanna see the MOH now.

Guess your friendship is over.", "I don't believe you. I think you are sucking up to your current friend group, so they don't kick you out.  You did get a pic, and you did say it was fine.  Your moh has kicked off because she's got dowdy taste, or was mean girlung the other bridesmaids in the current friend group to buy dresses which made her look better. \n\nYou bypassed the moh, and you don't want to admit it, because she's the alpha in your current friendship group. \n\nNot being horrible but you need to find your 'shiny spine and own your decisions. \n\nFurther tell your mean girls to t least blank out ops face before posting a pic of her without her permission.

It sounds like the bride was overly vague and should have sent you pics of the other dresses or something so you could align better. Then she told you it was OK when you texted a picture. So she is at fault.  The other bridesmaids and MOH are full of themselves for A) thinking the MOH needs to somehow overshadow everyone else, and B) taking you to task about it during the wedding - there was no point then!
