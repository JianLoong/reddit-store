They can be harassed for sure but it\u2019s much harder to be physically intimidated when you\u2019re on an (on average) equal playing field. This is an empathy issue; in this instance he empathized with a random stranger instead of working to understand your fear. Consider what this tells you moving forward.", "NAH. It\u2019s a homeless man in NYC, good luck getting the cops to talk to a homeless man (1 of thousands) that catcalls when many of them act in a way that is WAY more concerning.

And instead say that the choice of words is also used by misogynists. Like he isn't a misogynist but that's a misogynistic attitude/choice of words. So if he doesn't identify as one he shouldn't call sexual harassment a compliment. I don't want compliments. I didn't ask. Fuck off. I'll fish for compliments from family and friends.       \n\n\nAlso this works with micro aggressions to help people be less defensive when you correct them  for example about how calling someone exotic isn't a compliement it's an othering/racist type statement.", "If you don't believe he is a misogynist, why would you call him that?", "You should report it, but I don't think he is misogynistic for what he said, he is thinking about your situation from a male perspective\n\nEdit: grammar", "NAH\n\nThe only asshole is the homeless guy.

So I don't compliment anyone at all, but thats also not a good solution :(", "This was made into a full length film as well right? I remember it being really good. Unfortunately there is enough harassment in the world to flesh it out to feature length.", ">Ignorance and misogyny aren\u2019t the same\n\nBaby what do you think misogyny is?", "I disagree. Not everything bad or annoying is illegal and this just gives cops more pretext to harass homeless people.", "Every woman I've ever talked to on the subject has been catcalled, regardless of looks or size. \n\nIt's not a compliment. It's a power play designed to make women uncomfortable and enjoy the \"power\" to make them feel unsafe as they go about their day. It has nothing to do with attraction.", "Gross", "In roughly the same way that stealing someone's watch is a compliment because it means you think they have a nice watch.", "Wow, aren't you a joy to be around!", ">but as far as practical solutions, he's correct that there isn't really one\n\nThat\u2019s not what he said. He didn\u2019t offer any solutions, nor point out that there\u2019s not a good one. He didn\u2019t bring up problems with reporting to the police. According to the story, he did was tell op that she\u2019s overreacting and that she should take it as a compliment. \n\nI don\u2019t get why there are so many people bending over backwards, adding their own narrative to the (very short) story in order to make what this guy said sound reasonable. It\u2019s not.", "Compliment people's choices, not their bodies. It's okay to tell your coworker that her new haircut really suits her, or to tell a stranger that their jewelry is awesome. It's creepy and harassing to mention body parts, whether that's \"nice tits\" or \"your dress makes your body look great.\" And please don't think that commands such as \"you have such a nice smile, you should smile more\" are compliments, they're not and they rightfully piss people off.\n\nThe exception to the \"compliment choices\" rule is obviously when in an intimate relationship (\"your ass looks great\" is different coming from a partner you're comfortable with vs a scary stranger whose intentions are unknown), or if you're friends with someone who is comfortable with comments about their body. Otherwise, just don't.\n\nAlso, when complimenting someone you don't have a close relationship with, don't longer after the compliment! Even if what you said was nice and inoffensive, if you then stick around paying attention to them it makes it seem like the compliment was just a meaningless ploy to get their attention and manufacture a reason for them to have to interact with you. This negates any happy feelings from that now-meaningless compliment. Instead, say whatever pleasantries you wanted to say and keep moving so your compliments are given freely instead of coming with an obligation.", "It\u2019s usually safe to compliment people on things they have control over. Don\u2019t compliment people on their bodies. Smiles, eyes, general shape, hair texture/color, etc. it\u2019s usually safe to compliment people on their clothes if said right. \u201cYou look great in those jeans\u201d is different than, \u201cYour outfit is on point, I like your style.\u201d Saying you think someone applied their makeup well is a compliment on their skill, saying they have beautiful eyes (probably do to skillfully applied makeup) has more implication including subconscious undertones. \n\n\n\nYou may also still have bad luck with this method. Some people just don\u2019t want to be bothered at all, and even a benign compliment can be seen as abrasive. Since men don\u2019t walk around complimenting each other, randomly complimenting women ends up as a double standard. If a man is going out of his way to tell a woman she looks good, but wouldn\u2019t tell his bro the same then the compliment directed at the woman clearly has some alternate intention besides, \u201cI like making PEOPLE feel good and confident.\u201d It\u2019s changed into, \u201cI tell women nice things so they notice me and think I\u2019m nice too. I don\u2019t want to have sex with any men so I don\u2019t feel the need to do the same for them, even if it would make them happy.\u201d \n\n\n\nWomen are on constant alert for, \u201cIs this a nice person, or are they being nice because they want something from me that they\u2019re not allowed to take. If I don\u2019t handle this delicately I might find out he is one of the ones that WILL take what he wants if I upset him. Since I don\u2019t know what kind of man he is, I will play it safe and entertain him instead of being direct because hurting a man\u2019s feelings could end in my death.\u201d It\u2019s a real concern a lot of women have, and a situation that seems benign to a man might be literal life or death for a woman.\n\n\n\n\n That\u2019s why women hate random compliments, cat calling, etc. it\u2019s a constant reminder that they\u2019re in danger all the time. At work, walking down the street, and even in their own homes. Not to say men aren\u2019t also at risk for being victimized, they are! But not every second of everyday. Women have to think about things like, did that random guy who approached me follow me home? Did she lock the door? Does she have a weapon to defend herself with? Is he going to be waiting around the corner when she leaves for work the next morning? Or in the backseat of her car? That thought process occurs just because some random dude HAD to say something to a women he doesn\u2019t even know. It sucks and existing as a woman is difficult, scary, and often painful.", "Personally, what you\u2019re complimenting matters. For the most part, unless you know someone well enough, probably shouldn\u2019t be complimenting someone\u2019s body. Except for maybe hair, as long as you\u2019re not obviously creepy or racist about it. Like, I have brightly dyed hair, I almost never mind when someone says they love the color.\n\nAlso, if you don\u2019t know someone and are out in public, compliments should be one and done. Don\u2019t expect it to be an opening for a full conversation, though it can be sometimes, and especially don\u2019t get mad when it doesn\u2019t. The point of a compliment should be to make someone else feel a little better about themselves, not to make someone feel uncomfortable or trapped or forced to reciprocate in some way.\n\nJust my two cents.\n\nETA: One thing I\u2019d think would be worth asking myself before giving a compliment is, \u2018Is this something someone who is not romantically or sexually or otherwise nefariously interested in this person might potentially say?\u2019 Cause if it\u2019s not, probably better off not saying it to someone you don\u2019t know.", "This can be pretty tricky and subjective but for me, appropriate compliments have two requirements. \n\n1- If you're giving a compliment, actually COMPLIMENT something. \"You're so beautiful\" is a statement.....not a compliment. \"You're so beautiful, I love your hair.\" Is an actual compliment. \"You have the coolest jacket\" \"I've never seen eyes so pretty\" etc etc etc......A compliment should be about the person receiving it, so details are required. Even if it's just a generalized compliment, specifying it as such changes the entire tone. \"You're so beautiful, I can't even explain it.\" You know what I mean? Cornyness aside haha.\n\n2- Never give a compliment as a way to force an interaction. Throw them out unabashedly, but disconnected. If the person responds to your compliment by focusing and engaging with you, THEN you carry forward. Generally speaking though, most of my favorite stranger compliments came with zero interactions. I have very, very long hair. And sometimes I dye it pretty colors too. I've had someone stick their head out a third floor window when walking past and yelled \"I LOVE YOUR HAIR\" and then left back inside. It was so freaking random oh my gosh hahaha......but it made me smile all day and still lives in my head rent free 12 years later. \n\nI've had many instances of someone passing me on the street, standing behind me in line, sitting at a table nearby etc....who just toss a compliment at me and continue on with their day. It's always so uplifting and lovely. On the other hand, one time at a fabric store an employee expressed her appreciation for my leather trenchcoat and I thought she was my kind of people. Best friends for almost 20 years now!  I made the choice to respond to her compliment, and invited her in. \n\nAgain.....this is subjective. I'm sure there will be people who disagree with me. But as a starter, giving compliments this way shouldn't actually hurt anything. You can always get more smooth and interactive and such down the road if you choose.", "A compliment should be like the little hand wave/nod you might give someone you see on the street.  Keep it light, don't try to forcibly get their attention (e.g. if they have headphones on, don't interrupt them), and continue on your way afterward.\n\nSimple compliments that reflect a person's skill are generally welcome. \"That's a nice blouse\" - that's a person's skill at choosing clothes with colors/cuts that suit them.  \"I like your hair\" - again, it's a comment on the skill at maintaining a style/color.  Jewelry is generally safe to comment on unless, possibly, it's a necklace pendent that's lays low on the breast.  (It may seem like you're trying to justify staring at breasts.)  \"That looks good on you\" is borderline because it may come across as you're judging their figure.  I wouldn't recommend it with strangers but it may be okay with people you have regular contact with.  There are some coworkers that I know well enough that I'd be comfortable getting that compliment from, but in general a simple, \"Nice blouse/slacks/jewelry/whatever\" is better.  \n\n\"That shows off your (body part)\" is WAY off the mark.  Except for fingernails and possibly eyes, do not talk about, or even reference, body parts.  With nails it's understood to mean the person did a great job with their nail polish and/or shaping of the fingernails.  If someone has really pretty eyes and if you're talking with them for a while, it might be okay to mention it casually, \"BTW, your eyes are a really nice shade of blue\" but overall I'd recommend against it.  It is likely to come across as a flirtation.\n\nAll of this is with the caveat that tone and body language are also important.  If you say \"Nice blouse\" while standing 3 inches away and sniffing the fabric - you're going to come across as creepy.", "But ignorance isn\u2019t bigotry and living in NYC where he knows this isn\u2019t the only trouble she\u2019ll have with people on the street.

It's that easy"]}
