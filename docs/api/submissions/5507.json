Not sure if I would call the cops though, but that's only because in my experience with homeless people they'll either do nothing or make the situation 10x worse.

What he said was privileged. He comes from a perspective of not having to watch his back when men catcall him or worry how it will escalate if someone isn\u2019t around to help. He\u2019s lucky he doesn\u2019t understand, but also he should try and understand.", "NTA\n\nIf he didn't feel the homeless man posed a legitimate threat, he could have at least said something more supportive.", "Going against the grain, coming from another woman, NTA.\n\nNow, do you or I necessarily think your BF is a misogynist?

Cat calling is sexual harassment, many women have gotten murdered for ignoring a man\u2019s cat calling advances. \n\nYour safety is the most important thing at the end of the day.

His views are concerning.", "Your boyfriend *is* a misogynist.", "I\u2019m leaning mostly NTA bordering on a light ESH. What your boyfriend was getting at does have some basis in reality, as it\u2019s probably unlikely the cops will invest a whole lot of time or energy into a catcalling homeless guy. Bf could\u2019ve said it in a nicer way that wasn\u2019t as dismissive of your fears though, and the line about taking it as a compliment was highly unnecessary. \n\nOn the other hand, however, calling him a misogynist when you admit yourself that you don\u2019t think he is one doesn\u2019t really seem like it serves much purpose beyond retaliation, which isn\u2019t a very beneficial course of action in a relationship. \n\nMight be worth having a serious conversation with him about why it makes you uncomfortable, if he\u2019s still dismissive even after an attempt to have an adult discussion then you\u2019ll know that you\u2019re firmly NTA.", "NTA given his response, I wouldn't be surprised if he does the same as the homeless man", "NTA- real talk, men don\u2019t understand the fear of harassment like women do. They can be harassed for sure but it\u2019s much harder to be physically intimidated when you\u2019re on an (on average) equal playing field. This is an empathy issue; in this instance he empathized with a random stranger instead of working to understand your fear. Consider what this tells you moving forward.", "NAH. It\u2019s a homeless man in NYC, good luck getting the cops to talk to a homeless man (1 of thousands) that catcalls when many of them act in a way that is WAY more concerning. I think your boyfriend was trying to brush it off, bc worrying about what a homeless man yells at you in NYC seems like a dead end, but I can see how it would come off as misogynistic. If you were in a different city, I would agree", "NTA. In my experience, some men just haven't learned what a different world we live in. I've had to explain certain issues over the years to my husband that he just was never made aware of. He is certainly not and never has been a misogynist, just unaware of how we see and experience things very differently..\n\nI'd sit him down and explain how it made you feel and that what he said was misogynistic, but that you don't think he is one. Unless, of course, you do, and then why are we even here?", "Darling why won't you think sexual harassment isn't a compliment /s\ud83d\ude02        \n\nNTA, but you should probably not call someone a thing. And instead say that the choice of words is also used by misogynists. Like he isn't a misogynist but that's a misogynistic attitude/choice of words. So if he doesn't identify as one he shouldn't call sexual harassment a compliment. I don't want compliments. I didn't ask. Fuck off. I'll fish for compliments from family and friends.       \n\n\nAlso this works with micro aggressions to help people be less defensive when you correct them  for example about how calling someone exotic isn't a compliement it's an othering/racist type statement.", "If you don't believe he is a misogynist, why would you call him that?", "You should report it, but I don't think he is misogynistic for what he said, he is thinking about your situation from a male perspective\n\nEdit: grammar", "NAH\n\nThe only asshole is the homeless guy. Your BF knows the police won't do shit because no crime has been committed. He is just trying to find something good about the shitty situation.", "ESH Your boyfriend should have started his advice \u201cwell the cops are not going to do anything so \u2026 \u201c  Because he did not do that he comes off dismissive not misogynistic. In reality he is probably right, calling the cops will not work and confronting the homeless guy directly would likely be counterproductive so finding a way to avoid the gut or coming up with a way to cope with the abuse are your options. You shot the messenger by getting mad at him.", "Info: what do you think the police are going to do. \n\nIt\u2019s not illegal to catcall someone, it\u2019s just gross.", "If you don't think he is then why be that hurtful?
