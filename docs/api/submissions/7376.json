Her anxiety is interfering with your life, to the point where she\u2019s asking you to lock yourself in your room so she can watch TV without pants. She\u2019s fucking ridiculous. Honestly, her \u201canxiety\u201d sounds like an excuse to do whatever she wants. In the off chance that cleaning up the kitchen and being in your presence does actually cause her to become anxious, she needs to see a therapist, as you mentioned. It\u2019s interfering with your life, and it\u2019s incredibly unfair for you to have to clean up after her and lock yourself in your room, all so she can feel more comfortable. What about how you feel in the house that you also pay rent at? NTA. Your brother needs to open his eyes and stop coddling her.", "NTA. Using her status as a former victim of abuse to then victimize others is very low of her. I would honestly look for another place to stay if I were you, OP, this arrangement sounds incredibly unfair to you and very mentally taxing.", "NTA, you are correct a lot of this behaviour is unhealthy and she needs therapy. Especially with the cleaning incidents, it might be that it does give her anxiety, but it can also be an excuse to be lazy or not have to grow up properly.", "NTA \n\nYou are absolutely right, she does need intensive therapy if this is truly how she is feeling.  She can\u2019t expect you to walk on egg shells around her in your own home.  And you certainly should be allowed out of your room.\n\nEdit to add:  I\u2019m also bothered that she is uncomfortable seeing you without a shirt on walking from the bathroom to your room, but she feels it\u2019s ok that she doesn\u2019t wear pants in a common area of the home.", "NTA. If she isn\u2019t working on her anxieties why should you have to? \n\nAlso, I\u2019m going to have a guess and say he\u2019s just acting on her side cause life with her sounds like hell at the best of times. Imagine the poor dudes life getting on her bad side \ud83d\ude33", "NTA.\n\nBut do yourself a favor and find a new place to live because this is not going to stop.\n\nNot only is your SIL lazy, she also wants you out and she's apparently ready to do anything to get her way.", "NTA. This is completely insane. If I were you, I\u2019d be calling a meeting and (calmly) asking her why she thinks this is appropriate. She\u2019ll probably say \u2018because I have anxiety about it\u2019, plus some sort of backstory. You then say \u2018so you think that it\u2019s fair for me to not be allowed to use the space I\u2019m paying for because you have anxiety you won\u2019t get therapy for? That\u2019s unreasonable, your anxiety that you refuse to treat does not negate my right to the home I pay for\u2019. Just really drill her down on whether she thinks this is acceptable, and what she would do if you suddenly developed anxiety at being in your bedroom.", "NTA\n\nThe fact that she has these 'struggles' yet does exactly 0 to help them and to make positive changes in her life makes you NTA. You are right she does need intensive therapy.", "NTA\n\nYour SIL is **mentally exhausting**. \n\nIt sounds as though she will continue moving the boundaries if you let her.\n\nNot wearing pants in the common area of your place and expecting you to keep out is particularly bizarre and disrespectful.", "NTA she is clearly trying to force you out of your own home or at least make it as if you aren\u2019t there because you\u2019re trapped in your room. I would have one more honest conversation with your brother if you can, and if that doesn\u2019t work either look at moving out or just stop caring what she thinks and live your life how you want to.", "NTA, you were completely correct in your conclusion that she needs therapy or get over it. People with real anxiety learn little \u201ctricks\u201d to help cope with their anxiety. Not that the anxiety goes away like magic, but the level is more manageable. If she is not seeing a therapist about it and is actively creating new triggers for herself, then she is the problem. Not to mention the fact you are an equal share renter and the other details.", "Idk if i will be downvoted but NTA. I don\u2019t think there is anything wrong with her not cleaning the kitchen as long as her husband does especially if she is cooking. It is hard to tip toe in your own home around people. She cannot isolate the living room because she dislikes pants. And if she is unwilling to get help for her problems that is also on her. She can\u2019t go through life hoping everyone adapts to her needs and triggers. It is nice to be sensitive towards her problems but some of this is too far. Mostly isolating the living room imo. Which is why I said NTA", "NTA, thats not anxiety, that's crazy. Anxiety is just a catch all excuse to avoid anything she doesn't like or want to do and takes away legitimacy from people who do really suffer from true anxiety. I know many and they find a way to function in the world... She needs to do the same.", "NTA. I think she\u2019s doing too much and using her \u201canxiety\u201d as an excuse to get whatever she wants and having everything accommodated towards her.", "NTA\n\nShe is using anxiety as a way to manipulate both her husband and you. If her life is being impacted by anxiety as much as she claims, she should be working with a therapist to regain control of her life. \n\nIf you can move out, I definitely would. You pay rent, this is a house share, yet you are clearly not equal in this set up.", "\u201cMental health issues \u201c pfft! It\u2019s called being a manipulative self entitled spoiled brat. Find yourself somewhere else to live asap if you can and support your brother when he inevitably has enough of her and needs a couch to crash on.", "NTA - from someone with mental health issues.", "NTA - You can only accommodate someone so much. She sounds like she's constantly spiraling down. She needs help and you should probably consider moving anyway to avoid her.", "NTA. SIL's mental health issues management is her responsibility when dealing with everyday situations.  Expecting you to accommodate changing whims is not reasonable.  She needs to work on getting along with others (you) in shared common spaces.  Time to discuss this situation with your brother.", "NTA. Sounds like you're in for a doozy.", "NTA.  Your SIL is the AH, and it's easy to figure that out.  She wants to impose restrictions on you that she object to, for herself.  That's the AH.  And cleaning the kitchen causes her anxiety?  Please...\n\nYou're right.  She needs therapy.  Or she's trying to sham.", "NTA. You\u2019re right sounds like she\u2019s full of shit and a good excuse to just not do things. Cleaning the kitchen is a trigger come on really? If all of these triggers really were true she would be seeking help. Think the best thing for you would be to find somewhere else to live. I very much doubt this is going to get any better.", "NTA, she just sounds very difficult. \n\nTime for you to get a place on your own and be away from the crazy.", "Nta, you are a part of the house, you get equal say (especially since it's rented). She's trying to get rid of you, but still try to keep your part of the rent coming.\n\nIf I were you I'd go \"you wanted me gone, I found an apartment, and I'm moving out on x date, don't expect any more rent from me\"\n\nShe is simply using every excuse in the book to get her way, and I dint see her relationship lasting.", "She's clearly trying to get you to move out (using incredibly immature and dumb methods). \n\nDiscuss with your brother how to make it happen without you taking a financial hit. Make sure you're taken off the lease properly. Your life quality will increase after you're not subjected anymore to her insane demands.\n\nNTA but just grey rock, getting into arguments with this immature SIL is just useless. \n\nAnd meanwhile just stop caving to her demands, if she lays about without pants why would you wear a tshirt to go to the shower?", "She desperately needs therapy and you need to find yourself a new living situation because you shouldn't have to walk on eggshells in your own home.\n\nNTA.", "NTA- she is obviously trying to manipulate both you and your brother into a situation where she gets what she wants, better off getting out find somewhere else to live and hope your brother sees through her BS", "Yeah, NTA really at all, although I'm not sure you should call BS on her triggers so much as her reactions TO her triggers and the way she handles them. Her mom being abusive over a dirty kitchen is no reason for her to expect YOU to clean up the mess she made. That's rediculous. Your three options to solve her TV issue are completely reasonable. Her expecting you to not have full access to shared spaces is gross, and your brother shouldn't be ok with her treating you like that. You have done nothing wrong, but honestly, it sounds like your relationship would be better with your brother and SIL if you all were not roommates. Just maybe try admitting it might not be working well for everyone involved, and look into moving out soon. Although your SIL is probably going to be more uncomfortable with some other random person as a roommate.", "When she\u2019s sitting in the living room pantless start walking around in just your best banana hammock and T-shirt. See what she does then. And please video it. Nta", "NTA. But isn\u2019t this just main-character syndrome ?", "NTA, she's just screwing with you dude, she's not crazy just mean and selfish.", "NTA. I got tired of reading about her halfway through your post. She wants you out.", "NTA. Petty me says that you find her lack of pants \"triggering\". It's a physical reminder of the constant abuse she subjects you to in the name of her own anxieties, and you find her lady bits unpleasant to see. It's not right to fake illness, but I guess this is fighting fire with fire.\n\nIt's time to move out. If she can't live with a roommate then she can't have one. I'm betting that they won't be able to find anyone as forgiving as you've been so far so they'll have to deal with the rent themselves.

In the mean time, have a roommate meeting about reasonable expectations, like if you make a mess, you clean it so as not to overly inconvenience your roommates. You don't have to deny her issue with being too overwhelmed to clean the kitchen to say that her options are seek therapy and/or don't make a mess in the kitchen.  She can have a protein bar, no mess !  It's also totally unreasonable that you need to wear a Tshirt at all times, but she goes without pants in common areas and she expects you to hide in your room. She didn't hide in her room when you were going shirtless.", "NTA,yes we should take anxiety and mental health very seriously. No it is not an excuse to dictate how everone around her behaves.\n\nEspecially concerning her latest trigger.. how on earth does she think it is okay to take over your shared living room, dress the way she wants, and then demand you dont go in because she doesnt want to be seen like that?! She changed the house set up and can deal with the consequences! Or put on pants if its such a big issue!\nHonestly she sounds like she is just making stuff up now to maximise her own comfort. Sure she may have some anxiety for real, but this is next level. And even if all of it is genuine anxiety, it has gotten to a point where shared housing just doesnt work for her anymore so she should adjust! \n\nAnd also, check your rental agreement and what it says about the shared spaces, might be somrthing to help u out there too!", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

As in, we split a rental three ways that none of us owns. \n\nI learned that there are many things that trigger my SIL's anxiety, and I try my hardest not to bring up in her presence. Death, politics, student loans, medical treatments, etc. I do try my best (she's uncomfortable seeing me shirtless, so I have a dedicated t-shirt I wear when traveling from the shower to my bedroom), but it does get aggravating when I try to, for example, arrange a ride home from one of my roommates after I got major dental surgery. \n\nAbout six months ago, it started getting out of hand. She'll make a giant mess while cooking (for herself and/or my brother), but when it comes to cleaning up after herself, she's far too \"mentally exhausted.\" Usually my brother/her husband cleans up after her. One time he was gone, and I didn't clean up after her. She got on my case about how \"stressful it is to constantly be thinking about the messy kitchen.\" I said that she should probably clean it then, and she yells at me about how her mom would be verbally abusive to her any time the kitchen wasn't clean, so now cleaning kitchens triggers her anxiety as well. \n\nAnother one is when my brother will strike up a conversation with me while she is in the room, which happens maybe once every two weeks. If it's not about a topic she is intimately familiar with (i.e. comic books, our extended family) she immediately shuts down. Not being included in every conversation her husband has is also a no-no. \n\nI went on an extended vacation. While I was gone, the two of them moved their TV setup from their room, to the living room, which is right outside my bedroom. I don't mind. \n\nDuring this time, SIL very reasonably decided that she rather liked watching TV without pants on. It's not like we ever get unexpected visitors or anything. We have a chalkboard we use whenever ANYBODY outside the three of us comes into the house. \n\nI came back from vacation, and the newest trigger is apparently... me. \n\nShe's so wildly uncomfortable about the prospect about being pantsless in my presence that she's trying to insist that I lock myself away in my bedroom and don't come out when she's watching TV. Despite the fact that I am \n1. gay \n2. her BIL \n3. an equal renter\n4. a grown-ass man. \n\nI told her that she has 3 options. Move the TV back to her bedroom, which I never enter. Wear pants. Or get over it, because I truly do not care if she doesn't wear pants. \n\nDuring the argument that followed, I told her that this (along with the kitchen cleaning and conversations with my own brother) is the final straw and she either needs intensive therapy to deal with her anxieties or she's full of shit. \n\nI am now a massive pariah in my household for \"not caring about my own SIL's mental health struggles.\" Idk if my brother is fully on her side, or just siding with her because siding with your wife is always the thing you do.\n\nAITA? I'm going to get torn apart here, aren't I.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

She does not have the right to censorship you both and stop the 2 of you being friends. \n\nYour assessment was spot on... get therapy.", "NTA. She is being ridiculous and will continue to do so while her husband enables her. Good on you for standing up to her.", "NTA. That woman sounds a emotional blackmailer. If you start using her own spell against her, Potter, you'll see that they're gonna start making up some BS that will justify it being okay if it's her but not if it's anybody else, I 92% garantee it.", "NTA\n\nAnd here's how you know - you can move out.  You can find another roommate to split rent with, and you will do just fine.\n\nShe cannot.  There is no one else she can split rent with, because NO ONE other than close family would have jumped through these hoops for her.  Being respectful of someone's mental health is one thing.  Living your entire life to please their whims, because they won't handle their mental health issues in any way is an entirely different beast.\n\nYou need to have a serious discussion with your brother, and make it clear you are no longer living like this.  If HE cares about his WIFE'S mental health, then he should get her help.", "NTA. She's manipulative and your brother must be exhausted.", "NTA.\n\nShe\u2019s manipulative as she keeps moving the goalposts, you\u2019ve tried to accommodate her but there is a limit. Particularly in your own home.\n\nAnd whether she has anxiety or not has no bearing on her being manipulative.", "NTA. She's full of shit.", "NTA\n\nSIL sounds exhausting and I can't help but wonder why anyone would marry someone who not only has that many issues, but is clearly unwilling to work on them.\n\nI think you should be looking at living somewhere else though.", "SO NTA.\n\nShe has a reason for everything, except to compromise and live with you like a normal roommate.\n\nIf she wants to watch TV in a common area, wear pants or get over it. If she cooks dinner, and there is no plan for a chore split (like someone cooks, someone else cleans), then she cleans. Why didn't her husband clean?\n\nShe needs therapy. You, while NTA, need to start looking for a new place to live.", "NTA I have severe panic disorder, my brain basically logs pretty much anything as a danger and triggers a panic attack. BUT one of the first things you learn in therapy is that other people are not responsible for your triggers. \n\nShe needs to learn how to deal with this herself but tbh, it sounds like she's putting some of it on just so she can get her own way. \n\nIf I were you I would just stop engaging with it. Don't debate her on the trigger etc, just say \"no\". She wants you to clean the kitchen? \"No\". She wants you to keep to your bedroom? \"No\". Also, let yourself be shirtless, man. It won't kill her.", "NTA.\n\nIf he cared about his wife's mental health struggles, HE would be helping her get treatment.\n\nSomeone who accumulates anxiety triggers like she's collecting Pokemon either needs treatment, needs a different environment (not like it's cheap to rent without roommates, though), or has discovered that playing the \"anxiety\" card gets her out of any situation she finds inconvenient.", "NTA. I don't believe she has any anxiety at all. She's a big fat liar and manipulator.", "NTA", "Anxious partner of someone with anxiety here! If her anxieties are spiraling like it sounds like they are, she needs professional help \u2014 therapy and possibly meds.

Don't let her gaslight you into thinking otherwise. You should find a new place.", "NTA. Personally I think she\u2019s doing it to get you to move out.", "NTA. She is full of shit. But I would move out because nobody needs an a-hole roommate who would rather invent a mental illness than clean the kitchen.", "NTA But I think it's time for you to move, if you can.\n\nIs your s-i-l actually *doing* anything about all of these triggers of hers? It sucks to have them, but she sounds like she's adding new ones, and weaponising them.", "ESH\n\nI think that you are mostly in the right. The point where you became an asshole is when you said: \n\n>I told her that this is the final straw and she either needs intensive therapy to deal with her anxieties or she's full of shit.\n\nWhile you're right; she probably does need therapy, the idea that she is, \"full of shit,\" and just making up the whole thing seems pretty insensitive. Even if she was, that in itself is a mental issue at that point.\n\nOn the other hand, you are setting completely reasonable boundaries for a flatmate. You not cleaning up her mess, wanting to talk to your own brother, and wanting to use leave your bedroom as you please are all completely reasonable. There is only so much accommodating you can do, and it seems like you have already gone above and beyond. At this point, it might be best to move out if you can, before your relationship or living situation gets any worse. It seems like you would all be happier living apart anyway.", "All of this, and if I were OP, no way I\u2019d renew a lease with them.
