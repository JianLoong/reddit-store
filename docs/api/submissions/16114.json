That isn't jewelry that was passed down and left to be split among family. That was an extra special gift to you. It has sentimental value. It might be worth mentioning to them why you are extra cautious with those bangles. I'd be nervous about SIL keeping them based on her actions so far.", "NTA. I\u2019d be afraid the desirable bangles would get \u201clost\u201d during the photo shoot if you lend them to someone already that entitled.", "Well. You aren't in a stalemate so to speak. The bangles are yours, and I'm getting the impression as you are that you'll never have them returned if they are \"borrowed\" so, NTA and I wouldn't let them out of my sight.", "NTA I think honestly that you have every right to say no to something Family or not. If you don't think you'll get the Bangles back then by all means stick to your first decision.", "NTA. They are yours and are precious to you. Because she flat out asked you to gift them, you understand the likelihood that they don\u2019t end up being returned. It\u2019s not greed on your part, rather it\u2019s preservation of your own valuables.", "NTA. Your SIL is not entitled to your bangles simply because your niece likes them. They\u2019re yours, made by your grandpa, and you can never get replacements. I would\u2019ve give them up either, not even for them to borrow, especially since you know that what your SIL really wants to do is keep them.", "NTA and after her asking for them as a gift, I wouldn't let her borrow them either. I'd be surprised if they came back if you did.", "NTA. Your SIL sounds greedy and entitled. If your SIL walks out of your house with the bangles, you will never get them back, and it will cause a rift. Your instincts are already telling you that. Listen to them and hold firm. Those bangles should go to your daughter.", "Nta.

Those are yours, you offered an alternative. She needs to calm down, maybe her husband can talk to her", "NTA. Do not lend those to her.

You\u2019re being very kind and reasonable by offering to let her borrow something else. She\u2019s not entitled to your sentimental belongings.", "NTA, not your problem those are yours.

You said no.  They need to stop asking.\nDon't loan them anything  because you probably won't get it back", "NTA. Perfectly reasonable to not want to part with a sentimental custom made gift given from someone who (im assuming) is a pivotal figure in your life.

You will not get it back.", "NTA. You were right to say no in the end. SIL has made her intentions clear imo. If you borrow her the bangles, it would be very hard to get them back, if at all.\nIf she's not content with borrowing a different item, that's her problem. She and your brother need to back off about this. It's your jewellery so you do what you want.", "NTA\n\nShe can borrow nothing then. This isn\u2019t a hard one. If that makes her upset, that\u2019s a her problem", "NTA is it common in your family to ask each other for their possessions? \" hey this is nice, will you gift it to me?\" That's strange and unsettling.

Personally I'd make sure to hide them well or put them somewhere safe just in case they feel entitled to them for any reason.
