The discussion ended when you refused.\n\n  \nShe shouldn't be trying to guilt you by refusing to borrow anything else and I think you're right to not want to lend them the bangles in case they never give them back.", "You are most definitely nta", "No means no. You graciously offered other options, and she\u2019s giving the silent treatment. Let it go and stop offering.\n\nNTA\n\n\nBtw, next time don\u2019t show options if you\u2019re not wanting to share/loan them out, saves the headache.", "NTA. Hide those bangles.", "NTA but you should make sure they are locked away safely. They are yours, not your brother and SILs.", "NTA\n\nIf you let her borrow them, you'd never see them again. They'd say how kind you were for the gift or conveniently \"lose\" them.", "NTA. \n\nNo is a complete sentence. \n\nIf you let her \u201cborrow\u201d them, you\u2019ll never see them again. I\u2019d keep a close eye on them next time SIL visits.", "NTA but I agree with others: HIDE THOSE BANGLES!", "NTA- Do NOT \u201clend\u201d your bangles to SIL or your brother, you won\u2019t get them back. You aren\u2019t at a stalemate, you said no, that\u2019s the end of it as far as you\u2019re concerned. People who don\u2019t take no for an answer do not respect boundaries and want what they want. Don\u2019t give in.\n\nPS- Stop offering her anything and waiting for reply. You said what you said, if she doesn\u2019t want to choose anything else, that\u2019s on her. You\u2019re done here. Make sure those bangles are locked up if she changes her mind. They will \u201cmysteriously\u201d  end up in her purse.", "NTA. The bangles are your connection to your grandfather and your brother and SIL are being disrespectful. You\u2019ve said no and that\u2019s final.", "why do people wanna gift jewelry to their toddlers/babies so bad? this has been a topic i\u2019ve read on AMIA a couple times this month", "NTA. Also get ALL your jewellery from your grandad that you don't wear into a safety deposit box before things go missing", "Hide them don\u2019t loan them out. They will disappear.", "Buy a gold bangle and gift it to the baby as an early first birthday gift. Get one that looks as close as possible to yours. Don\u2019t correct them if they think it\u2019s your grandfather bangles.", "Nta! Absolutely not! And I wouldn't let her borrow them either bc they'll \"mysteriously\" go missing.", "NTA.\n\nI get the feeling she would absolutely take those bangles and keep them if you let her borrow them. Or they'd 'go missing'. \n\nHold onto those bangles in case you have a baby, even if you don't they are still important to you so you don't owe anyone their use.", "NTA \nDon't let her take anything else!\nAnd keep it safe. \nIf she has a key to your house, maybe it is time to get it back, and I'm not even joking. Saw a sub the other day where the SIL entered OP's house, without her consent, to steal her dogs!", "Nta. Tell your brother to buy his daughter some bangles. Not that deep. SIL is hella entitled.", "NTA, OP. Your SIL is weirdly entitled. Like all other commenters, I also believe that the bangles won\u2019t be given back to you once taken. Take decision very wisely.", "NTA. \n\nRead enough stories on her to know this usually gets worse with time. Find a different place for them out of the house would be ideal. Deposit box, maybe?", "NTA. Your SIL can go and commission a set of bangles for her daughter. Your bangles are YOUR bangles.  Get them resized to an adult size and wear them.  I honestly don't get (cultural divide or not) why people insist that you give your things to others because they like them too. Like, it's not YOURS in the first place.", "No, nope, etc, are full sentences. There is no stalemate. Hide your jewelry NOW. I've seen enough to know they just might go \"missing.\" NTA. You shouldn't feel bad either. They were made for you specifically and are deeply sentimental.", "NTA.\n\nHide them ASAP.", "NTA In your place, I'd have been comfortable loaning them right up until she ASKED you to gift them. The nerve of her.", "NTA, you stood your ground. I\u2019d let her borrow them so long as I got them back, but I see why you\u2019re wary about SIL. No means no in any situation, and the photoshoot will still be just as special without the bangles. If the bangles were what made the photoshoot special, then I think they need to reframe why they\u2019re doing the photoshoot in the first place.", "The audacity of someone *asking* you to give away a cherished heirloom...", "NTA If you let them borrow those bangles and you will never get them back.", "NTA. Those were yours since you were a baby. The SIL can't decide that she wants them for her child. She's behaving like a toddler.", "Ew she is no true muslim , it was a gift to you by your grandfather and it\u2019s yours forever. She and your brother can go get something lovely for her. Gold isn\u2019t cheap but if they want gold for their daughter they need to buy it themselves", "Then I guess she doesn't get shit.", "Others have said similar but I\u2019ll reiterate OP - if you lend those bracelets you\u2019ll never see them again.", "NTA. It was a gift to you from your grandpa. You have every right not to give them to your niece without any explanation whatsoever. As mentioned several times before, make sure your SIL can\u2018t find them.", "No is a complete sentence. Put them away safe and tell them that they can pick something else. Don't engage if they argue.", "NTA, also I am guessing SIL maybe tempted to steal those bangles. I would hide them.", "NTA, however, does your brother know his wife wanted you to give your niece the bangles? Borrowing is fine, but not giving. Those are yours and they are special.", "NTA. This might be my American thinking but an infant doesn\u2019t need gold anything.", "NTA.  They are yours and you should only give them to someone if you want to, period.", "Sorry, SIL can get over what she wants and deal with your generous offer.  NTA", "NTA. No is a complete sentence. You said no, that\u2019s the end of the discussion", "The moment you let them \u201cborrow the bangles\u201d you will have a fight on your hands to get them back. Keep strong and good luck. NTA.", "NTA. She would 100% keep them even if she said she was borrowing them. Great job trusting your gut. It might be worth it to get a small safe, even a fireproof one or getting a secured deposit box at a bank to keep them away from her or any other family member who might agree with her and disagree with you. If those leave your house, you will never get them back.", "NTA. You did offer to lend them, but SIL asked for them as a gift and is stuck on them. You won't get them back", "Yeah...SIL is gonna steal those from you, time to hide them...\n\nShe will take them and feel entitled to them because you wouldn't let her \"borrow\" them.  She will justify her shitty behavior through that.", "NTA\n\nIf she had just wanted to borrow them for the photo shoot I would have shared, but they were a meaningful gift to you and are to sentimental to give away.", "NTA. If you loan her the bangles you'll never get them back.", "NTA.\n\n\nYou said no.  At this point, I would not even LEND them any of your jewelry because the odds are too high of you never getting any of it back.", "NTA. And no need to apologise. No is a complete sentence. If she decides she doesn\u2019t want to borrow something else, then that is what she decided. No need to grovel at her feet. You did nothing wrong.", "DO NOT let them borrow the bangles because I can assure you, you won\u2019t get them back. At least not without a major might.

Sil may not intend to return them and they are YOUR property that YOU get to decide what you want to do with.", "Suggest you also put them somewhere safe separately at home for when they do come to \"borrow\". Out of sight out of reach of sticky little fingers. As above though this isn't a stalemate. A stalemate suggest an ongoing bargain or discussion. You've been clear, no need to repeat or go back over  - if they attempt to bring these up again,  just respond in kind. \"All offers of allowing you to borrow any of these items is now gone\".

Yeah that\u2019s why she didn\u2019t want to give it to me!!\n\nMy parents moved from my childhood home recently and I found it while we were packing. It was in an old piggy bank. Must\u2019ve thought that was a safe place to leave it lmao. I got it cleaned and gave it back to my aunt. \n\nHer expression man\u2026 I could never appreciate that ring like she does.

Only pass down heirlooms to people who will appreciate the sentimental value above all\n\nNTA", "NTA you also might not get them back, so there's that .....I like the response, my decision is final.", "> (I also don't think you can trust them.)\n\nDefinitely this. I\u2019d find somewhere secure like a safe or even a safety deposit box in a bank to store them for now. Otherwise they might magically walk away. \n\nNTA", "Ahreed NTS. The sister-in-law is acting very entitled", "This! ^^ nta. Absolutely can't let someone borrow something when they've already expressed their desire to own it. Yes, they'll argue \"what, you don't trust me?\" but that's the calling card for every moment in history where this similar situation has occurred and someone was nice enough but never saw their stuff again.", "What do you mean \"may\", people who intend to returned borrowed property certainly don't have their heart set on a particular item. It's like SIL and people in the same situation act like they're star-crossed lovers with these inanimate objects owned and often highly valued by other people.", "I agree they haven\u2019t a hope of getting them back once SIL gets their hands on them.", "One of these will absolutely happen if OP gives in. Better lock your jewelry up, they might disappear. NTA.", "Exactly this. \u201cWhat bangles?\u201d", "Oh absolutely. If anything I think you're understating it.", "Stop fucking jumping to this conclusion EVERY time someone wants to borrow something.

Exactly where in the post does it indicate SIL is a thief?", "It\u2019s baffling to me that some family members think they\u2019re entitled to something that has sentimental value to someone. \n\nAnd when they are asked of the same thing, they suddenly find themselves unable to part with their own sentimental object.", "Those bangles aren\u2019t even an heirloom \u2014 it was *made for OP by her grandfather*. If she wants to make it an heirloom, she can\u2019t pass it on to her own daughters but she\u2019s more than welcomed to not do so either.

You could offer to have a replica made or give them pictures so they can have a replica made.

Why exactly did you come to this conclusion?", "Because people don\u2019t usually take up really hard for people acting suspicious without an ulterior motive.
