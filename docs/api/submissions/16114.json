If they keep pressuring you, you can always inform/remind them that was given specifically to you by your grandfather and you will pass it down to your own children when the time comes. Do not let your family guilt you into lending or giving your bangles to your SIL. \nEdit: Added a sentence", "NTA.\n\nBorrow **indefinitely**, she means and leave you to break your niece\u2019s heart right to her face when you snatch them right back off her wrists!!!\n\nTell your brother his wife is getting nothing at this point.", "NTA.

Pushing you to the point that you feel this kind of confusion is a clear sign that your SIL doesn\u2019t recognize or respect either the bangles\u2019 meaning or your sole ownership, and thus isn\u2019t in a position to borrow them.

I'm wondering, since you mention being Muslim, (and quite frankly, I know little of the Muslim faith and in no way am I attempting to offend you or other Muslims) is it common to gift items to someone, family or not, who \"covets\" or asks to be given something you personally own? In my Christian protestant learnings, I was taught not to covet and to give freely whatever I owned and was coveted. As I've matured and lived and experienced life with a bit of age, I recognize this is a noble notion and has little practicality in real life, as this is 2022 not 30a.d. My question is based in curiosity to understand how your SIL felt it was ok to ask you to gift the bangles to your niece. I guess I'm perplexed as to how someone has the, umm, idk the right word really, guts? nerve? entitlement? to even ask you for a gift to gift.\n\nOn a personal note, I have a professional portrait of myself around 14 or 15 months old wearing a gold hinged bangle. My oldest niece, now 23, had a portrait made when she was 14/15 months old. When I learned she'd be having these photos made, I offered my same baby bangle to my sister for the session. My sister was very appreciative and my niece wears the bangle in her portrait. It warms my heart every time I pass this photo, my copy now hanging on my wall. The differences are my unsolicited offering, genuine appreciation, and the immediate return of the jewelry after the photo session. You cannot control what others' do and say and feel and that's ok. You are within your personal rights to feel what you feel and uncomfortable with the word no are powerful and should be respected as well. It's my genuine hope that this incident won't cause life-long resentment. If SIL continues to pout with her silence and refusal to compromise, know she is intentionally being passive aggressive and attempting to manipulate you with guilt for causing family strains.", "NTA. You've said no and that should be enough. However if they keep pushing to \"borrow\" them. Tell them you are planning to pass it down to your daughter one day.

Have a feeling there is no photo, those bracelets have been a point of discussion behind your back and you would not get them back. How do I know?

The sister-in-law is acting very entitled", "Right? The thing is, I always told myself I was going to get the ring back to her. I actually saved my quarters (put them in the same damn piggy bank lmao). But then my mom found out and happily told me that it was a family heirloom and I would never be able to buy another ring like it.\n\nI stuffed the bank into my closet and spent a lot of time crying over it. I kept an eye out for a similar ring all these years. Seeing my cousin talk about giving it to her daughter one day makes me feel so much better. \n\nMy mom is still pissed I gave it back to my aunt. She keeps snarking about it all the time, \u201csee now your cousin has it and you\u2019ll never get it again.\u201d Well good, that\u2019s why it\u2019s called FAMILY HEIRLOOM. She\u2019s just angry that the ring lives on and it\u2019s a very special bond between my aunt and cousin.

Her intention was to have all of the grandchildren sit down together and divide what was special to them. My oldest cousin stole those pearls from my mom\u2019s house(don\u2019t know when). \nWhen my oldest cousin passed last summer (tragically) her son (12)wanted the pearl necklace and earrings (he wanted all of her possessions not just the jewelry). No one wanted to tell him no because he\u2019s young and just lost his mother.", "Thank you.", "oh ok so not an aunt, thank you this makes sense. I swear I read everything you wrote about 6 times but I'm also sick and a bit tired \ud83d\ude05 just trying to follow along.\n\nthat really is an odd thing for a 12yo boy to insist on keeping, regardless of rightful ownership.", "I know, he\u2019s got some interesting tendencies. He wanted all of her stuff, including her boots, hats, saddle, and was really worried about whether the truck payments were going to be made and who was getting it.

No one who's entitled enough to pressure you into letting them borrow something has the empathy to give it back\n\nI've lost quite a few things that I cared about + a significant amount of money before I learned that lesson. If you wouldn't be okay giving it to them, don't do it", "No it\u2019s based on the bangles being a special gift that the OP had made for her specifically.

But he is 12 and who knows what will happen to them in the future. It\u2019s not just that it\u2019s an heirloom and it really has nothing to do with their monetary value. they were given to grandma from grandpa and they were special to all of us. Those people had immense positive impact on all of us and the grandchildren that grew up with them as parent figures should split things honestly and fairly and yeah I\u2019m kinda pissed that my cousin stole from the house. \nBut that\u2019s what it is, it is after all just stuff.", "Lock those bangles up, preferably somewhere secure outside of your house.", "That creates a problem if there are no daughters in the current generation. My brother and I both have sons so my mother's jewellery goes to them as the only grandkids.", "I hate how Reddit calls any gift from a family member an \u201cheirloom\u201d - like you say, it\u2019s just a gift, and in this case it\u2019s a bespoke gift. It\u2019s not a heirloom. It probably will be, in a generation or two - whether from OP gifting them, or from her dying and them being passed on in her estate. Now?

I'd be nervous about SIL keeping them based on her actions so far.", "so he's a thief?", "NTA, those bangles will \"go missing\" as soon as they leave your sight or she'll keep forgetting to return them. They're obviously sentimental to you, I wouldn't let her borrow them.", "NTA: If you had lent them to her you wouldn\u2019t have gotten them back.", "NTA.  If you find it in your heart to let them be borrowed, go to the photo shoot with them and get them back in your possession the second they are done.", "NTA you run the risk of never seeing them again.  Ver presumptuous of her to ask for them for an early bday gift.", "NTA - but as a solution, perhaps you could let her borrow them and return them immediately?
