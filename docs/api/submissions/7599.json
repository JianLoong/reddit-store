My step mom has been struggling to hire any nail techs to work at her salon so she asked me to help her on a holiday weekend. I have a full time job myself already, therefore, I am taking my time away from my own family to help her out. Also, the salon is 45 mins away from my home without traffic. I worked both Saturday and Sunday. Both days between 9-10 hrs. I am not a nail tech so I didn\u2019t work on anyone\u2019s nails. I only did the prep work for pedicures which includes, scrubbing, cleaning, and massaging. I also cleaned the salon and did everything she asked me to. I didn\u2019t have any breaks. I had to scarf down my lunch. I have already told her from the beginning that I would need to get paid. After the end of the night on Sunday she paid me my tips, I only got half the tips because I didn\u2019t work on anyone\u2019s nails. Ended up being about $40 total in tips. When she gave me the money, I asked her again about my wage. She told me that I should be grateful to work at her salon and managed to get tips. She didn\u2019t want to pay me for a days worth of work. Her reasoning is because I don\u2019t know how to work on anyone\u2019s nails and is not license to cut nails.
