Clean up your own messes", "\u201cI always clean up after myself\u201d you\u2019re OJ Simpson at the murder scene covered in blood telling us you\u2019d never hurt your wife.", "Then why did you act like a child?", "You're kinda being rude to be honest, very rude and very immature, like a kid. The irony. . YTA.", "You did exactly what a spineless kid would do, you fool!", "Spineless kid?  Instead you\u2019re acting like a brat.  You made the mess you should clean it.", "Well clearly you need to be told, because you're not fucking doing it.\n\nDon't want to be treated like a child, then stop acting like one.", "The wrong way to prove you\u2019re an adult is to throw a hissy fit over not wanting to clean up after yourself.", "Yeah you can\u2019t say you \u201calways clean up after yourself\u201d,  because you don\u2019t. \n\nInstead of being a spineless kid, you actually acted like a brat.", "Except for this time, when you're flat out refusing to clean up a mess that YOU made?", "But you didn\u2019t clean up after yourself.", "You\u2019re not: you\u2019re an adult now.", "You just proved that you dont clean after yourself", "From this reply alone NTA. If you can relate that well to my comment your sister is TA.", "Exactly. You should have used that new spine to say, \"You don't need to talk to me that way.\"\n\nBut you still should have cleaned your mess.\n\nYTA", "\"I will definitely clean this up. But mind your tone.\" Sounds like something I would say. I'll clean up, but I need a little jab at the end.", "I have a feeling, because of the way op describes her, that that would be even worse. I'm with op they didn't even have a chance to get a word out and we're already getting told they NEED to clean it up. NTA op", "If you wag your finger any harder, it's bound to fall off.", "I know how things go, we\u2019ll just end up arguing and I wasn\u2019t in the mood for that", "I find your point very vague to be honest", "The sister may be an asshole, but in this situation that reddit is being asked to judge, OP is THE asshole. The question we're being asked to judge is 'was I the asshole for not clearing up my own mess due to spite', not 'is my sister an asshole in general'. So yeah, OP is still TA for not clearing up her own mess, having an asshole for a sister doesn't remove responsibility for op to clear their own messes", "Oh, I agree. She (sister) sounds like she was rude AF. But worse or not, I would call out the rudeness as opposed to refusing to clean up the mess I made. I\u2019d rather have the behavioral high ground.", "Sounds like you\u2019re arguing either way?", "All you've done is prove her right. And based on your reactions here, it sounds like she actually is right.", "Then you\u2019re the asshole", "Just in the mood to argue with Redditors huh?", "To be fair, sounds like you\u2019re the problem. I\u2019d argue with a grown ass adult that doesn\u2019t know how to clean up after themselves when they make a mess too. I wonder how many \u201csingle instances\u201d you decide to \u201cstand up for yourself\u201d. \n\nYTA, and you\u2019d never be invited back if I was your sister.", "I would have said \"I was planning to clean it up, but if you're going to be rude and treat me like a child, then I'll be rude and act like a child, and I'll leave you to clean it up\" that way she knows your intentions, but she has no recourse except either apoligize or you walk out the door and she cleans it herself.", "Then how does it feel to be a donkey \ud83e\udd23", "And acting like a brat that refusing to clean up it\u2019s messes avoids an argument?", "You really don\u2019t understand their point?  You literally refused to clean up a mess you made in your sister\u2019s house, which only reinforced her perception of you as someone who cannot be trusted to clean up after themselves.", "Read your own post to resolve the vagueness.", "The point is you left the mess and didn\u2019t clean it. A little dense are we", "You made a mess and didn't clean up after yourself. Therefore, you've proven that you're a person who makes messes and refuses to clean after themselves. It's been *days* and the mess you made still hasn't been cleaned up by you. \n\nThe only point you're making is that your sister was completely right. You don't clean up after yourself.", "How is it vague?  You refuses to clean up your mess proving that your incapable of cleaning up after yourself as your sister probably knew.", "Idk man as soon as someone talks to me like that I'm over whatever they were talking about. That's a them problem not a me problem at that point", "But that\u2019s just a single instance", "How do you know that she has that perception? Or are you just making up assumptions. We only know what we hear from OP's perspective and they don't mention anything of the sort. Personally I still believe that OP was an AH for not cleaning the mess, no matter how rude they believe their sister to be. However, to make the generalization that they don't clean after themselves because of this is just weird. You can judge OP but why are you making assumptions based on nothing?", "All instances are \"single instance\" when taken separately, but your sis may add them. You know rule - if you have single instance - you cannot deny you \"do it\" forever.", "If you wanted to take a stance you chose one of the stupidest approach.\n\n>On my way out I accidentally knocked over a plastic flower pot that was standing on one of the planks in the hallway. Before I could say sorry she said: \u2018yeah, you have to clean that up because its your fault\u2019.\n\nIt was your fault and she told you to clean it up.", "You just walked out the door and didn't clean up after an accident you are responsible for. Your negligent actions **proved** your bossy sister's point - you're immature, irresponsible and obstreperous. \n\nY T A ."]}
