Part of it is when I have every intention of doing something, then someone tells me to do it, I literally can't do it.

This is absolutely the same situation. Want it done out of the good of my heart STFU telling me what my goddamn eyes already know. NTA. That's her house.

Seriously OP, this post is written in a way that makes it look like you know you're the asshole but you're trying to get sympathy from strangers on the internet and your comments prove you're an immature child.

Do you really think that would work? \n\nMaybe the situation needs to be escalated to stop. \n\nI am assuming that OP is right about the situation. That her sister is very controlling and likes to get the first strike in when a chance opens. Like the posts above that say their mom says, \"you're welcome,\" instantly as they touch what they were passed with no chance for them to say, \"thank you.\" It is a long term, ingrained behavior that is probably unconscious but they probably know it is crappy, petty, and designed to put the other off balance.", "Or even a \"you wanna try that again, but this time like I'm an adult guest and not a recalcitrant child?\"", "You're making a judgement based on zero information.

Even if I was planning on doing something, if someone tells me I HAVE to I now will go to my grave before doing it", "To me it more sounds like there's a lot of context missing here.

There's alsopathological demand avoidance where any demand is something the person feels a deep need to reject and avoid", "Except OP says they were going to clean up but they literally never got the opportunity to say or do anything before her sister took a very harsh and disrespecting tone with her. Totally valid of the sister to be upset and want it cleaned up, not okay to be domineering and disrespectful when it was an accident and so far the other person hasn't actually done anything to warrant your disrespect.", "I agree.  I would too.  Both parties are the AH", "I would for a guest. Not for family (except grandma).", "Especially if I left it in an area where people walk.

They live with the mess, not OP", "I didn't look at their history at all. I'm just saying sometimes when people freak out about someone making a mess it can be because that person is a mess all the time. You never really know.
