I come back to my room after getting some things from the store, I see my computers shut off with a sticky note saying \u201cI wanted to play roblox with my friends.\u201d I rushed to open my computer and all of my hard work was gone. I\u2019m still in college, i\u2019ve been studying really hard but I have to cut up some of my time to watch my sister\u2019s kid for her. What\u2019s even worse is that her husband is a work-a-holic and refuses to give up his shifts or breaks to take Cameron even for a second. Now, I have a huge test coming up and none of them want to watch their own child. I still haven\u2019t signed into the test-center and I only have 2 more days to do so.

I told her Cameron was disrespectful and terrible then marched off and drove off\nShe hasn\u2019t dropped off Cameron at me and my mom\u2019s house today. I am enjoying the peace and I have finally signed the paper I needed to sign to get the date to write my test.

First off OP NTA and true some of your actions may look harsh, but OP your sister is throwing away her kid and isn't being a parent. Either she learns to take some responsibility or you may get CPS involved. Also the sister's husband needs to stop it with the extra shifts and see what is going on, because right now this is just a hot mess.

You are not a parent to Cameron and thus not responsible for watching him.  It is time for his parents to act as parents.

He\u2019ll be parroting words he\u2019s heard somewhere else, maybe from his parents or from kids at school. It\u2019s likely he\u2019s acting out to get attention, any attention.

Just try to make sure you're saving your work as you go, and check if the software you're using has an option to do scheduled auto-saves (like once every half hour)\n\nBacking up is definitely a good idea as well, but that can be done fairly easily by using Dropbox or Onedrive and saving your work in that folder so there's a cloud version of it available.
