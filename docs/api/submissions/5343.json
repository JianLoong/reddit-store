He needs to prove he is worthy of being trusted.", "NTA.  He lost your trust.  He has to earn it back.  I'm sure you didn't strip your place down to the studs.  You are bound to have left some things small enough to steal out in the open.  If those things didn't go missing, you might give him a bit more trust.  Just have a private conversation with your brother and explain that you're working on it, but things take time.", "NTA. He broke your trust by stealing and he hasn\u2019t actually done anything to regain that trust, it wasn\u2019t even that long ago, and he never actually apologized for it.

But you probably could have done it in a less obvious way.  Locking money, credit cards and things like your SS number up in a desk is one thing, and a wise precaution (even with those who don\u2019t have a history of theft) but collecting large items and piling them into the bedroom is a bit much.  It can even make people more likely to steal  since they feel that you don\u2019t trust them anyway, so what the hell?  At some point, your probably going to have to start trusting your brother with some of your things. Put away small valuables and leave out the rest.

Just because his *wife and mother* (not exactly unbiased opinions there) trust him, doesn't mean you have to.

The fact that you still feel jumpy like this is something y'all should be able to talk about and that he made amends for. Given how you're talking about this, he never did.\n\nAnd honestly why would guests who came over to your home stay while you and your wife went for a walk in the first place? The whole purpose of the visit is to see you. That was either their cue to leave or go on a walk with you", "NTA.   Maybe the best thing would have been to say let\u2019s do that another time I\u2019m tired and still have too much to do.", "NTA. Just bring up the things he's stolen from you in the past, and leave it there.", "NTA \n\nbold of him to call it A mistake when it sounds like this was a continuous thing that happened many, many times. Not being trusted feels like shit, but that's the consequences of not being trustworthy", "Kinda YTA, but the real issue is the anxiety from the environment you were raised in.

Less means YTA.", "I\u2019m stuck on why him having a beard means anything.", "Seriously, trust is earned and also people need to apologize when they do things wrong to other people. There's no part of this history that says he ever has tried to make anything right or acknowledge what he did. Your mother and his wife just want you to pretend like it never happened which is wrong", "Not from me specifically, he would take anything he could get his hands on in the house, including my things. I don't know why exactly but my mom later found out he was using drugs.\n\nHe never directly apologized but we kept a relationship throughout it all. So not sure about the amends.", ">made proper amends\n\nWhat does that mean?", "He kept stealing from his teenage years until he was about 21-22.\n\nFor the past few years, he's kept a job and got married and now his wife is pregnant.", "And your brother has done nothing to earn it, he hasn't even made the barest amount of amends.", "My exact thoughts.

We all know they stole stuff at some point, but I would never do this to their face.", "And having a pregnant wife - lol", "So no. He has never acknowledged what he did you wrong, he's never apologized, and in no way made amends. He has two people who are willing to yell down people who don't pretend like it never happened.\n\nThis should be the first and last time the three of them are guests in your home given that they don't believe in any way they should earn your trust and that you should have no basic boundaries with them", "Saying \u2018I\u2019m sorry\u2019 means nothing on its own.\n\nA person needs to own what they\u2019ve done in its entirety, and how it\u2019s impacted people (and let those impacted people share how they have been impacted, without interrupting or justifying). Checking in to see if there\u2019s something they can do to help relieve/make things right (within reasonable requests).\n\nAnd then they need to show actual changed behaviours.\n\nSaying sorry without the rest is just a way to manipulate a way out of past actions and avoid current consequences.", "Acknowledging the wrongs, fully and completely acknowledging all of the wrongs.

I will absolutely never trust of my sister after what they have done to me. They may change for the better but time is the only thing that can heal. Even with time I don't think I feel any different. He may be a better man. He may be someone that would not do anything. And if that is the case why was it such a big deal that you moved YOUR personal belongings. Also if you ask my opinion his wife has 0 reason to talk to you any type of way period. Now since you do know what both of you went through. I would recommend just calling and telling your brother that because of yours and his childhood. You just have major trust issues and they don't stop at him. I'm sure it took time for him to trust his wife. I'm sure you don't trust your mom either. Just explain you are sorry it hurt his feeling but that it was a justified move.

But saying sorry for what I did is not that hard. He needs to face his own faults before ever expecting trust.
