I instead wanted them to take my car, 8 years old, runs great but has some body damage. They aren't into cars so that wasn't the issue. I bought myself a new car and was ready to give them my old one. Well they went and bought the car they wanted cost $1800. 6 months goes by and has some issues, they pay $500 to get it fixed. Then another 6 months goes by and has some major issues, will cost 4k to fix. They come to me  asking for help. \n\nI refuse to help with cash. Instead I say to get rid of that car and take my 2nd car. Still runs great, is now only 9 years old. They aren't interested in wanting my car, they want theirs fixed. Wants me to pay half for the repairs. I still refuse and say you can have my car or nothing from me. They are pissed off and the moms family is calling me an AH cause I won't pay for half as I can afford it. I don't want to sink in more money into a car that is so old and months from now something else will break. They borrow money and get it fixed but is upset with me and thinks I'm an AH for not paying half. So AITAH for not paying half of the repairs?\n\nEdit: my car was a 4 door sliver Honda Accord they bought a Red Mini Cooper. My car had some body damage which is what I believe they were embarrassed about.", "created_utc": 1697398651, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/178n52n/aitah_for_not_helping_my_kid_with_their_car/", "score": 33, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Sounds like a spoiled kid.", "NTA. Being able to afford the repairs makes no difference. You provided a very generous alternative to the money pit they decided to buy. If they don\u2019t want to take you up on your offer of your old car, that\u2019s their choice and they can figure out how to deal with it.", "NTA. They had a prime opportunity for a free car that was reliable and they thumbed their nose at it.  You say your kid isn\u2019t into cars, but I\u2019m curious about the make and model of the free car vs the make and model of the car they chose to purchase and whether they just wanted a \u201ccooler\u201d-looking car.\n\nAnd that the mom\u2019s family is calling you trying to shake you down is outrageous.  Let them pay the 4k if they are so worked up over it.", "NTA:  You warned them this would happen and gave them an alternate solution, they declined.  What you said would happen happend so again you offered an alternate solution, they declined again.  \n\nPeople are allowed to ask for help but they cant get mad when you dont offer the exact help they want.", "Nta.   You gave them an option.  They refused. They are asking for your help. They do not get to demand what your help looks like. \n\n They need to learn a valuable lesson here.", "NTA.\n\nMini Cooper - once described by a mechanic on Reddit (question was what is the worst car out there) as \u201c10lbs of shit stuffed into a 5lb bucket, designed by Satan himself.\u201d\n\nI understand the kid\u2019s taste, though, I have now owned 2 Gen 1 Coopers. This is NOT an affordable car to repair and they are riddled with issues. My husband is a mechanical engineer who keeps mine alive, but would rather set it on fire.", "Let me guess... the junker LOOKS better than the one you're offering. Kids are stupid.\n\nNTA", "NTA - you\u2019re offering them a car that works, which is clearly priceless, while they prefer to keep spending money on a car that doesn\u2019t.\n\nExcellent, but expensive life lesson.", "[deleted]", "INFO\n\nI suspect you're NTA, as you're offering solutions that are reasonable and even financially sound, given the info you've provided. That said, it feels as though the specific vehicles involved here, are in some way relevant or color the conversation. I'm not sure why anyone would think it made sense to drop $4k on a car they only spent $1800 on, but if they managed to somehow get some really special and rare car that has a much higher fair market value, that might change things. \n \nSomething about the numbers and the vagueness here just isnt quite adding up for me, but maybe i'm just tilting at windmills.\n\nIn any event, if this is as simple as weaning a kid from parental bailout, you've provided alternatives that meet their needs. They can either take on the $4k responsibility of their purchases or they can get a $0k solution from you. From here, that feels almost charmingly fair and reasonable.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

They chose not to take it. They aren\u2019t entitled to your money.", "NTA. Just because you can afford the repairs does not make you liable or responsible for doing so. They bought the car of their own free will. They are responsible for repairs, not you. If the car is in their name and not yours, not your responsibility to pay no matter if you have the funds or not.", "NTA.\n\nNot your car, you gave them a totally viable option, and from the start were clear that it was a bad idea and you wouldn't help when it went poorly.  You don't owe them a car in any case, so your offer is already above and beyond.", "NTA responsibility you paid for it now you care for it. Anyone complaining to you can pitch in and stop worrying about your pockets.", "NTA, it is an expensive lesson to learn from his POV", "NTA.  Nice how the extended family who are not involved in any way all want to put their noses in.  Your kid purchased the car against sage advice so they can fix it under their own dime.", "NTA.\n\nIt's a lesson. I also buy an 20yo car when I was younger, have to put like 3x is price in repair in 3 years and finally give up after need more and I cant pay for schoolm that car, and pass my classes.\n\nBTW, i buy a BMW back then and now use a reliable Honda.", "NTA.  Their car their problem", "Nah they're a kid who wanted the cool funky car that clearly wasn't maintained.  Time for grown up consequences.

If you\u2019re going give it to them anyway", "NTA but fortunately your in-laws are lining up to pay for the repairs so it's all good.", "What fresh hell is this? Their stance makes no sense seeing as they aren't even into cars. Just because you can afford something, that doesn't mean you are obligated to do it, especially because it would be idiotic to do so.", "The car I was offering was a Honda Accord. They bought a Mini Cooper.", "It did look nicer than my car as mine had some body damage. Was hit from behind and once scrapped on the side.  It Still looked decent nothing hanging off or missing but it ran great, solid engine. My inspection always passed. I wouldn't have bought another car if they weren't looking to get one. The insurance gave me money to fix the body damage years ago but I pocketed the money as I really don't care about the dings in it.", "That's exactly what I said. With the 4k you can buy a different more reliable car instead. But they are young so they know it all and us old people are just stupid.", "I had put in the comments. I offered a Honda Accord and they bought a Red mini copper no special edition or  anything. My car had some body damage, maybe they were embarrassed cause of that which never bothered me.", "To your kid: oh my brother/sister/genderneutral in Christ, *why?*", "oh... yeah... sorry kiddo, this is the time to learn about feeding the cost of your desires. It will only ever get more expensive, both financially and emotionally. A car isnt who you are, its just a thing that enables you.", "A Mini! That changes everything, you ought to be catching the YTAs now.", "Yikes, is he gay?", "Bro I'll take a Honda accord", "Well, now they're learning an important lesson about what happens when you prioritize fashion over functionality. /shrug\n\nSeriously, you give a Honda even the most minimal maintenance care and it will last forever. An 8 year old Accord? Treat it well and it'll carry you another 15 years.", "How much would it cost to fix the body damage?", "My first car, 1990, was a 1976 Ford LTD.  Talk about embarrassing it was a boat.  I got over it because it was free.   You have given your son more than a lot of parents and are still offering him a generous option.
