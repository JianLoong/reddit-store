I stopped replying after like 15 minutes of him screaming at me and then I just zoned out \n\nNo, you are definitely NTA.\n\nYour dad clearly has his own issues and demons for which he honestly should have had counseling for years ago if he ever wanted to raise kids in a happy household. But, you can't make someone seek therapy for a problem they don't believe exists.\n\nI am sorry you have to experience this.", "No, sweetie.  You are NTA.  He is.  He should be ashamed of himself for terrorizing his own son.  His behavior is threatening and out of control.  That you are scared to even walk by him says a lot about how he has been behaving.  It is ok to be scared, and he needed to hear it.  It may not change how he behaves, but you do not need to apologize.  He does.  He is wrong in so many ways.", "NTA  \nIt takes guts to stand up and say something like that, especially to a parent. Your feelings are valid, and you have every right to express them. Your dad needs to chill and understand the impact of his behavior on you. It's not about disrespect; it's about creating a healthier, less scary environment. Don't let anyone make you feel dumb for being honest about your feelings. You're not alone, and reaching out for support is a sign of strength. Hold your ground, and if an apology is needed, it's on him to make things right.", ">he's my dad and he's just trying to help me\n\nNTA. If he's just trying to help you, then what's the need for shouting and screaming? Is that the way he \"helps\" your mother? His co-workers?", "NTA, please speak with a councillor or therapist. You need coping mechanisms before this ruins you.", "NTA.\n\nIf someone can't communicate without shouting or belittling, then they can't communicate. If he wants to help you, he needs to figure out how he can actually help, because obviously he's not.", "NTA it\u2019s a normal reaction to be afraid of someone who is screaming at you or unable to control their anger. It\u2019s a shame your mom enables him instead of supporting her son.", "Sounds to me like your dad has really bad anger issues and your mom is probably taking his side because maybe she's intimidated by him as well, I think you should try focusing more on your grades that way you can avoid arguments with your dad, I don't know if he ever got physical with you but my best advice is to listen to your parents until you can afford to get out of that house.", "NTA.\n\nSounds to me as though he should be apologizing to you.", "NTA\n\nYou have a \"dad\" problem, and you also have a \"mom\" problem.", "Put your dad in the shittiest home possible when he\u2019s old", "NTA.\n\nI've been in that position before. Fun fact, I'm somewhere between LC and NC with my dad now. Your mom most likely doesn't approve of what he's doing either and is just gaslighting you to try to keep peace so she doesn't get any residual anger in her direction. That's what mine always did.\n\nYour dad is a jerk with anger issues. Dissociation is a coping mechanism to escape traumatic situations, so if he really hates you \"zoning out\" he only has himself to blame. Sorry to say that you will have these fears and traumas even long after you finally get out of that house, but none of that is your fault.\n\nYou are a child, they are adults. More than that, they are parents. It's their job to make you feel safe and if they're doing the opposite then they are the ones failing at something. Not you. This isn't your fault. And if you really don't feel safe, try talking to a trusted adult in your life or a counselor at school.\n\nWishing you all the best. One survivor to another.", "NTA. I should imagine that being screamed at is scary for most people. You should not be made to feel bad for having expressed a feeling. Your father may well be trying to help you, but he is going about it quite the wrong way. As you, most people will zone out, when they've been screamed at for a while. You just don't want to be in that room where the screaming is going on, so spiritually you distance yourself. In that state, where you can't hear what is being said, obviously you can't learn anything either. Would it at all be possible for you and your dad to get some family therapy? I think you could benefit from that, the both of you. Until that happens, you are definitely not the AH. You may be doing something wrong or something stupid, I don't know, but you can't be made responsible for your father's screaming. That is on him.", "NTA. \n\nYelling isn't helpful!!!\n\nIf he wants to help than he should put in some effort to find out the reason for your grades, get you tutoring.", "You should know your mom is a passive enabler of abusive behavior. She is not the one that will protect you against him. Her repeated attempts to make you apologize show a toxic dynamic you live in. Your father has anger issues.  Your grades are not the problem here\n\nDO NOT APOLOGIZE FOR STATING HOW YOU FEEL\n\nNTA", "NTA I am sorry to say your dad is an example of bad parenting. He should be sitting with you and discussing why you are getting bad grades. My dad used to yell and throw things when I was a kid. I think it left me with some emotional scars. It's not healthy for him or you.", "NTA\n\n>15 minutes of him screaming at me and then I just zoned out\n\nso this is a coping mechanism of yours kicking in when faced with a prolonged adverse experience you can't escape, ie your dad yelling/screaming at you for far too long. it has nothing to do with disrespect; it's a psychological shield you've created against the hostility your dad creates and forces you to face\n\nit's shameful I need to give you the advice one normally provides to adults while raising their children, but separating the behavior from the person is a great way to thread the needle between explaining how/why you feel the way you do and mollifying your dad: clarifying and saying your dad doesn't scare you, but his behavior when he screams and yells at you, *does* scare you. \n\nYou could even maybe try to explain that it's so difficult to regulate your emotions in the face of his anger that you check out now as a means of handling it. Your mom might start getting it when you use language like this. I'm not an expert though and I really recommend you find a counselor that can help you with this. It's so tricky, I'm so sorry you're dealing with this. \n\nNobody should feel like they're walking on eggshells lest they trigger the anger of a man in their house. You deserve to feel safe *all the time* in your own home, OP.\n\nYou deserve to feel safe all the time in your own home.\n\nYou deserve to feel safe all the time in your own home.", "NTA Your dad isn\u2019t trying to help anyone. Your mom is weak. Sorry you\u2019re in this mess.", "NTA. You've already gotten some really good comments on this post. I hope it is helpful.\n\nI just shake my head at the mention of your parents thinking that yelling/belittling you is \"helping\" in any form or fashion. That type of behavior is simply abuse and you're so used to this situation is feels \"normal\" for you.\n\nTrue helping is encouragement, kindness, support, tutoring, whatever helps you improve your classwork. It is NOT the situation in which you find yourself now.\n\nI agree with the earlier comment about going to talk to a school counselor and seeking support outside of your home. I wouldn't necessarily tell my parents (if it were me) because they will really explode in anger at the thought of you discussing your homelife with someone outside of the family. You should still seek support from wherever you can find it.\n\nAll people deserve to have a safe, happy and loving home to live in; too many people are deprived of that.", "My dad was like this when I was in highschool.

There is nothing wrong with you for feeling scared while a grown man who should be taking care of you yells at you. Whatever he may say, he knows he intimidates you, and he wants that. The fact that you zone out is you dissociating and protecting yourself. \nHaving been where you are, all I can say is to get through it and don\u2019t ever be ashamed of your fear. You\u2019re strong for pulling through. Dad should be ashamed of himself.

The fact he admits to zoning out on his dad while he was talking about the grades kind of tells me that he\u2019s not entirely innocent and his dad may have legit points. \n\nAlso when I was a teenager I thought my mom was the biggest bully because she was actually just being a good mom and keeping me out of trouble and trying to help me.
