He was always coughing prior to his diagnosis and it took them years to finally figure out what was going on, and it was only after they had a \"dog day\" at school; where they brought in a local dog shelter for the day and 13 dogs to visit the kids. My son all the sudden couldn't breath and was rushed home from school by the school nurse. This is completely against protocol but I'm really close with the school and the teachers and she absolutely panicked and just threw him in the vehicle and rushed him home to me. By the time we got to the ER his oxygen was at 81 and only got better with breathing treatments. They ran a bunch of tests (chest x-rays, blood work, lung and oxygen monitoring) and also ran allergy tests a few days later after finding out his episode was when surrounded by a bunch of dogs. Turns out he has both asthma and an allergy to dog dander/hair. It caused him to have an asthma attack that day at school.\n\nAll of my husband's family is aware of this, as this was close to Thanksgiving that it happened and we had to cancel having dinner with his family due to them having 6 dogs in the house of the person hosting (SIL). Now my son is actually gone for the day (with my mom) and we had invited MIL over for a late lunch. She shows up here with her Rottweiler. I didn't even know at first because she just walks in to our home and I happened to be in the bathroom when she walked in. So I come out and the dog wasn't in the kitchen with my MIL. But after a few minutes the dog comes out in to the kitchen and jumps on me. I asked my MIL why the fuck she brought the dog here and she said \"well it's not like Christopher is home\". I immediately told her to get tf out. My husband comes out of his office asking what was going on and I pointed to the dog and told him his mother was just leaving. She tried to protest and I told her again to get out of my house. \n\nMy husband thinks that while my heart is in the right place and I have reason to be upset, he also thinks that I overreacted because Christopher won't even be home for another hour and we have plenty of time to clean before he arrives. I truly don't see it this way. I see it as my MIL is disrespectful of my son's health condition and no longer should have access to my home or be around my son.

And it can be very difficult to clean them up properly. Your MIL stomped all over your boundary with no regard for your son's medical issue and your husband didn't back you up so both of them are TAH here.", "NTA\n\nSounds like a serious problem and I\u2019d do anything to avoid it too.\n\nGrandma, of all people, should understand.", "NTA. Your Mil is a rude jerk. Your DH is trying to down play it so e doesn't hurt mommies feelings. Since he thinks it not a big deal he can clean the house while you and son go get a treat of some sort.", "NTA. An hour isn\u2019t enough to clean the house and get the hair and dander out of the air. And it\u2019s not like your husband or mil was going to lift a finger to help clean either.", "NTA- no reason for the dog to be there. So not reasonable to expect you to clean after the dog visits to protect your son.", "NTA  I know I'll get hate, but it's never ok to bring a dog into someone's house without clear prior approval of the resident.  This was very disrespectful.   But I do think a total ban is the nuclear option.  Why not try a clearly stated boundary 1st?  If she can respect that, then it's a win.", "No, no, no!  You are absolutely NTA!  A child with a dog allergy so severe that being around dogs induced an asthma attack so severe he has to go to the ER should NEVER have a dog enter their home. \n\nI'd be concerned about a dog *owner* coming into the house wearing clothes that they have been wearing around the dog, because the clothes will also have dander on them. And absolutely he should never ride in their car. \n\nI don't think your husband understands what is necessary to remove allergens from a room. It's not just a quick run the vacuum cleaner. Just in case anyone else reading may be considering calling you overreacting here, it requires:\n\n1). All fabric/upholstery that can be removed from the room (throw pillows, curtains, stuffed animals, etc,) needs to be removed and laundered. \n\n2). Soft surfaces like fabric-upholstered furniture and carpets must be throughly vacuumed with a vacuum that has a HEPA filter. Even then, it is not possible to remove all the allergens without steam cleaning. \n\n3). Hard surfaces - floors, walls, furniture - must be cleaned with wet wipes or cleaning cloths; floors must be mopped. If using reusable cloths, they must be changed frequently to ensure you don't merely spread the allergens from one surface to another. \n\n4) An air purifier with a HEPA filter that's rated for allergen reduction (in this case, pet dander, specifically) needs to be run to catch any airborne particles stirred up by cleaning or left by the source of the allergen. This can take several hours, depending on the air purifies and room size. \n\nYou may get some push back, because obviously you can't control areas outside of your home. But the difference is, you can leave those places. Your home needs as much as possible to be a place where you and your child can relax and not worry about his asthma being triggered.", "NTA your son has a health condition that would've been compromised and could be compromised.", "NTA It is easier to avoid dander than it is trying to get rid of it later. It is very selfish to do this to someone when allergies are the issue. Why would anyone think this was ok?  Why clean up after, when it can be avoided? I am just bewildered..........", "NTA. Your son might not be home for another hour and the dog will be gone \u2014 but the dog dander will remain. It would be soon enough to ban MIL from your home if your son starts reacting to the dog dander she brings in on her clothes.", "NTA To be clear, I don't think you overreacted at all, and I can understand why you were both baffled and angry with the situation. But based on the how things happened and what she said, I really don't know if your MIL is just ignorant, or entirely indifferent, as to how serious things are because of how severe your son's allergies are (combined with his asthma). \n\nIf it's just ignorance, then it may be worth trying to educate her on the matter. And I think maybe you need to make it clear to your husband as well, perhaps involving him in a conversation with your son's doctor? It's not a simple matter of just cleaning up after a dog, and your son absolutely should not have to worry about dealing with allergies in his own home.\n\nBut yes, *firm* boundaries need to be created now to prevent this from happening. And if your MIL or even husband won't respect those boundaries, there is a much bigger issue here, I'm afraid.", "NTA. Even without the issue of the allergies, who shows up with a dog in someone else\u2019s home without asking??? Then she doubles down. Those two things would be enough for me to not welcome her in my home again and to couch my husband.", "As someone who also has asthma and an allergy to animal hair/dander (dog, cat, rabbit, etc), NTA for demanding she and her dog leave/wanting to restrict her access. It is INCREDIBLY hard to clean animal hair off of certain surfaces, and the dander will stay inside of the air of a house for a long while depending on what the dog did/where it went. Rotties shed a moderate amount, so there might be a lot more hair than you and your husband expect. Even with my medications, I still get allergy attacks if I\u2019m around moderate/heavy shedders. If he\u2019s not medicated for both asthma and his allergies, and depending on the severity of both his asthma and allergies, he might have an attack as soon as he gets home\u2014runny nose, watery eyes, trouble breathing, the works. Maybe try and have him stay out of the house for as long as you can, to clean any carpets, furniture, and rooms that might have dog hair. Asthma attacks can be brought on by severe exposure to allergies, like what happened with the dog day at school, so for his best interest, keeping away from any and all dogs is the best bet to keeping him safe.", "I'm severely allergic to animal fur (mainly cats plus some dog breeds) it doesn't matter if I'm in the house at the same time or with them I will still have a reaction. It isn't that simple to just clean as their fur gets everywhere.. there isn't enough bleach in the world to make it safe for someone with severe allergies. NTA!!

Your husband needs to step up.", "You can't clean the friggin air! The particles are in the air!\n\nMother-in-law completely disregarded your sons health and was a very rude guest bringing a dog into the house without permission. \n\nYou had every right to tell her to leave immediately, It was dangerous and rude.

Nta", "NTA\n\n#LEAVE YOUR DAMN PETS AT HOME\n\nWhat is *wrong* with dog people?", "NTA. Your husband is a fool who takes risks with his child's life for the sake of appeasing his twisted Mom. I say twisted mom because she knew of your concerns for your son's condition and did this as a deliberate provocation, like a dog pissing on a tree to establish territorial dominance. She should be banned from your home and contact with your son for the foreseeable future. And if you husband can't see this then........", "NTA.  If MIL knew childs allergy issues, she was ass for bringing dog.", "NTA. But that school nurse? If she really threw a child in respiratory distress in her car and rushed him home, she needs to be fired and lose her nursing license. You need to be just as livid with her as you are with your MIL. There is absolutely zero excuse for that and I would be furious that a trained medical professional handled my child\u2019s emergency like that.", "NTA!\n\nGood on you! I also hope that you cleaned up the house too. It sounds like your son is allergic to dogs(it is possible become allergic, I am not a doctor) and had an asthma attack as a result. I think that you should get your son tested for what allergies he can have.\n\nIf your son has a bad reaction to dogs like that then you should not have a dog in your house at all!\n\nTalk to your husband about the risks of asthma. \n\nI have asthma(though it doesn\u2019t act up often) and this hit home.", "NTA: Dog dander can shed off the dog.

Grandma probably doesn't even believe in allergies so she decided to do her own little science experiment on your family.", "NTA. Just because your son isn't there, it doesn't mean the dog takes all its fur and dander when it leaves. Your MiL may not have realized this, and hopefully you educated her on this before she left. \n\nAsk your husband if he relishes the idea of cleaning the house every time your MiL comes over with her dog.

Somehow I doubt that though.\n\nNTA, dismissing a child's health concerns is really fucked up I think", "NTA. That's pretty rude.", "NTA - it doesn't take long for dog hair/dander to get all over the house. Is your husband going to deep clean on his own? You Mil was absolutely disrespectful of your family and specifically of your son's health.", "Have a no animals in the house sign made for each door. Similar to no soliciting signs.  This is a reminder for people who bring pets where pets aren\u2019t wanted and dangerous for occupants of the house.", "NTA It's not her house and she's playing with your child's health. Your husband should understand that.", "Heeeeck no, you\u2019re not. Having a dog around literally sends your son to the hospital. So a dog just wandering around shedding fur and dandruff in the house could pose a serious problem. And your MIL knows this. As for your husband: he knows how serious your son\u2019s allergy is. I think he\u2019s under-reacting, which baffles me. I\u2019ll give him the benefit of the doubt tho. That might just be his attempt at diffusing a situation between two people he loves. I hope he talked to his mom, at least. It\u2019s his job to make boundaries clear with her; he shouldn\u2019t be leaving that up to you.", "NTA your son comes first in this case. I hope you educate your husband on asthma and how this will now effect the home. If you son has allergies to dogs then at this point no dogs can come inside the house and he will no longer be able to visit homes with dogs.", "NTA on just this very narrow issue but it seems to me there's about three thousand ways of dealing with your concerns without causing an immediate argument. Now you've just made yourself look like a crazy person and will find it unreasonably hard to get your husband on your side after freaking out on his mother in a way that was obviously loud enough to bring your husband out of the office. I wish you luck because, again, your concerns are reasonable but the methodology might need a little work.", "NTA.  \n\nHusband needs to reevaluate his priorities because I\u2019m guessing he let her in the house in the first place.  \n\nHe should\u2019ve told her to take her ass home and tbh id be sideeyeing the Sh!T out of him for not doing so.  \n\nSeriously, how you and he haven\u2019t had WORDS to put it MILDLY after he pulled that stunt is beyond me.  \n\nOP husband if you\u2019re reading this, what the actual F&CK were you thinking.  Your mother is a piece of cr@p for endangering her grandkid like that but you, you\u2019re even worse for allowing it and then having the nerve to tell your wife she overreacted when she\u2019s the ONLY one acting like an actual parent", "NTA\n\n\"Plenty of time to clean\"?  No.  There's no way to get all the pet dander in one quick cleaning.  And I guarantee you that neither your husband nor MIL were planning to do any cleaning.", "NTA \n\nPlease educate them Op. \n\nAre there articles, pamphlets or info from the doctor\u2019s office that you can screenshot and send to the whole family (including hubby) regarding allergies? I\n\nKeeping a home clean and free of allergens can be hard. Everyone should be on board with helping you and keeping the space clean for your son to breathe. \n\nIt looks like ignorance on your partner and mom\u2019s part. I hope they can be educated so everyone can understand what kind of sacrifices are necessary to maintain the familial relationship. This way you all can celebrate and still be together at different points of the year if possible. If my nephew or grandkid had this kind of allergy, I would educate myself and be considerate so he can continue live a healthy life. \n\nAlso, will air purifiers help? I hope you can look into that too. \n\nGood luck Op! Glad the doctors figured things out regarding your son and things turned out okay that day.", "NTA, your son is allergic to pet hair/dander.
