He\u2019s never introduced me to his family before because he said things were complicated with them and he didn\u2019t want them to ruin things between us. After we got married, he kept promising he would tell them but he continued to put it off.\n\nThe first time I met my in-laws was in the hospital after my husband was involved in a serious car accident. It was already a stressful situation and I didn\u2019t know how to explain to them that he had been lying to them and that he didn\u2019t invite them to his wedding so I told them I was his friend. My husband was asleep at the time but his best friend was there and he wasn\u2019t shy about letting me know he thought it was my responsibility to tell them the truth and I was throwing my husband under the bus. At that point, it would\u2019ve been worse if I had told them the truth and I felt it was something my husband should tell them himself.\n\nAfter my husband woke up he had to tell them the truth since they repeatedly referred to me as his friend and he knew he would be digging a bigger hole for both of us if he didn\u2019t correct them. He was mad I didn\u2019t at least say girlfriend so it would\u2019ve made it easier for him to explain. His family were upset with both of us but since he was hurt and I'm a stranger, I feel like they were mostly taking it out on me. My husband, to his credit, did try to defend me but he\u2019s still mad over me saying I was his friend.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1687877088, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14kfody/aita_for_introducing_myself_as_my_husbands_friend/", "score": 88, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It is on him to tell them about your marriage. It sucks that he put you in that situation, honestly.  Why is he hiding you?", "NTA- but why on earth would you marry someone who is too cowardly to tell their family that they're getting married? At the hospital you were simply following along with what he already wanted which was to not inform his family of your existence. How in gods name was it your responsibility to tell HIS family that you're his wife?", "NTA what the fuck were you supposed to say? Your entire relationship he hid you from his family and even when married he still tried to hide you. You rock for trying to keep that up because why would you think he wanted anything else? As if telling them in the hospital was the \"right time\". He and his friends are wack. It's his secret he wanted to hide so it's his obligation to be the one to tell his family. He's the reason you're a secret in the first place so why the fuck would it be your job to have to face that confrontation? A bit selfish if you ask me.", "NTA \n\nYou don\u2019t know his family, but he does. All you did was respect his wishes, despite your own frustration about the situation. His friend seems to want to spin this as you being petty, but this was your husbands decision. Instead of throwing him under the bus by exposing the lie while he wasn\u2019t conscious to defend himself or your marriage, you waited until he was awake to respond to his family as he saw fit. \n\nI\u2019m sorry that was difficult for him, but at a certain point that\u2019s just the natural consequence of the choices he made. It is not your job to take the hit for him. You didn\u2019t make the choice to lie, but you\u2019re the one who the rage was directed at. Imagine how badly they would have treated you had you sprung it on them yourself. He wanted you to face the music on his behalf after he put both of you in a bad position. You are owed an apology, not the other way around.", "How in the world is it your responsibility to tell his family the truth about his lie? Geez this dude is spineless and seems as tho he's great at shirking accountability. His friend too. NTA.", "NTA. Seriously? Your husband and his best friend expected you to tell his family? This is entirely his part to play. What are they even thinking? This isn't a normal situation.. he was hiding this from his family and wanted time to disclose it to them. Now he expects you to just tell them the truth while he is in the hospital. The way i see it your husband is taking advantage of the situation, he knows well that his family will go easy on him coz he is in the hospital so he just wanted you to take on the heat from the start.", "NTA, but why didn't he tell them about you? I mean at least at some point a \"I am seeing someone\". Seems a bit weird to me...", "NTA\n\nYour husband had 4 months to tell them they were married. They also had the entire time you were together to tell them he had a girlfriend. It isn't your news to share.\n\nI think you were forced into a deer in headlights position and you should never have been in that position in the first place.\n\nJust tell them you wouldn't of had to tell them you were their partner had they told them before you got married.\n\nALSO why would you refer to yourself as his GF you are married for hecks sake. No need to bend the truth as well as withhold it.", "NTA\n\nIt's not your responsibility to deal with his familial problems. Sure, it's stressful to deal with in the hospital,  but if he hadn't put it off, it would have been easier on him.", "NTA\n\nSo they're all blaming you for the consequences of his actions.  I think you were in a damned if you do and damned if you don't situation.  You mean you can't read his mind and know how he would have wanted to to respond?  Your husband had your whole relationship and 4 months, this is not on you.", "NTA - by any stretch of the imagination, if you ask me.\n\nI wanna say that not telling his family you were married should have been an enormous red flag, but honestly my guy and I almost didn't tell our family we were getting married... so I can't really place judgement there. Family is tricky... I get that.\n\nStill, it's HIS family, and HE was the one that didn't want to tell them. You abided by your husband's wishes, as you had for the past four months. It's reasonable for you maintain that, since you weren't able to defer to him. That's not your fault.\n\nIf the family wants to be mad at you because they don't want to be mad at a hurt person, and you allow it, that's a noble sacrifice on your end, but **you will need to sit hubs down and lay everything out, and get this all straightened out after he's released**. It's out, so he needs to come clean to his family on why he wanted it to be kept secret, so that you don't have to live the rest of your life as the one that secretly stole someone away from the family, or some asinine theory like that that aunties and uncles come up with when they don't know all the info.", "NTA - This is a really odd situation. He hid the relationship completely.. So how could you be expected to assume that calling yourself his girlfriend would be better than saying you\u2019re his friend?", "NTA: Your husband didn't want to tell his family and probably still wouldn't have told them if it weren't for the accident.\n\nYou were never really told why so no one should blame you for not wanting to tell them at the hospital.", "NTA\n\nYou simply covered for the story your husband made HIMSELF toward his family. He brought upon himself the fallout of that story...", "NTA. Your husband created this drama by shirking HIS responsibility to set things straight with his family in the first place. NONE of it was your responsibility to clean up. You were within your 'rights' either way - to tell them yourself, or to leave it up to him - because his being unconscious in the hospital creates a legal situation for you. As his WIFE, all the decision making is YOURS, but his family wouldn't know that.  You leaned toward keeping HIS desired pretense until he was ready to disclose it; and had to make a snap decision without his input. You did just fine, and I stress that this is entirely a mess that HE created with his poor choices - so when everything settles back down, he should be apologizing for putting you in this situation in the first place.", "NTA. \n\nHe'd repeatedly put off telling his parents, and if you'd told them the truth before his accident he would undoubtedly have got mad at you for that.\n\nThis was an emergency situation, but I can still understand why you hesitated to tell the parents you were married.\n\nHe shouldn't be mad at you, because the only reason you were initially lying was due to his own behavior in not being honest with them.", "EsH .  Your husband is for this subterfuge and putting you in this position,  you  were an asshole to yourself for going along with it in the first place and being treated like some dirty little secret.  \n\nThe parents may be assholes as well but you didn\u2019t give any info as to the reason for whole charade", "ESH\n\nIt definitely was your husband\u2019s responsibility however he\u2019s in the hospital after a serious accident.... seems like a good time to mention that since you would be the person making his medical decisions.\n\nThe dude is in the hospital & everyone is worried more about his parents reaction to y\u2019all being married than the guy laying in the bed? How ridiculous are these people??\n\neta \u2014 how the did this all play out? Staff & doctors came in & you pretended you were just his friend??? I can\u2019t even imagine this scenario... what?? How?? I wouldn\u2019t be able to keep that secret a secret any longer.", "ESH...I guess? It is really not clear why your husband didn't tell his family he was married, especially after the fact. I though for most of this that he hadn't come out as gay...but then you said 'girlfriend' so I'm at a total loss. He's an AH for hiding your marriage.\n\nHonestly, at the point that you're in the hospital room--and you are actually next of kin, not them--you needed to just live your truth. It wasn't 'your responsibility' but you did not need to carry on a stupid lie that could have become quite harmful.\n\nIt sounds like neither of you really have a relationship with his family if you've never met them and he doesn't tell them things like 'I got married,' so in the end you don't have to worry that they hate you.", "ESH youre married, def should\u2019ve introduced yourself as his wife. Why lie the first time you meet them?", "Malicious compliance. Yta, but he earned it, lol", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It was his responsibility to tell them, and he didn't. The situation sucks but this wouldn't have happened if he had just been honest and set firm boundaries with them.\n\nFrom what was shared, there's no guarantee that he would have been supportive if you would have told them in this situation. He gave you a lose-lose situation and that's not fair to you.", "Weird reverse  While You Were Sleeping situation...\n\nI'd have said I was his wife but you were under stress and pressure so NTA", "NTA\n\nYour husband is the one who kept trying to hide you, and in the absence of him being able to make decisions or speak for himself you had the respectfulness to continue his own wishes. It just simply bit him in the ass when you all were finally brought together, and he has no business being mad over his own lie.\n\nAs soon as husband is able i would gather the family and him together and demand answers. I would be okay with my partner saying they don't want me to meet their family, but i would also want to know exactly why, and it sounds like you were never told why, which makes me suspicious that this avoidance was not for your benefit, but for his.", "NTA but why would you agree to be someone's secret spouse? I can only imagine he has a side piece.", "This is some seriously key information that I would love to know... that husband is absolutely hiding something. She should dig deeper into this reason, because now they dont like her because of this. So it's a no win for a pointless lie. NTA", "speculation here, but since it appears that it wasn't done for wife's protection or because of past fallouts, it seems like the issue lies with the husband. My guesses are husband is ashamed of or embarrassed by OP in some way that either he hasn't brought up to her directly or would only apply around family. Or husband has something to hide that come up if OP got to talking with family long enough.", "He could still have family as emergency contacts along with his wife so they notified everyone on the contact list who in turn notified everyone else.", "And you know full well that if OP said anything about being his wife, he would have gone off saying that he wasn\u2019t ready to tell them.  Op did the right thing by keeping her husband\u2019s secret.  Now it might have gotten messy if he had to be taken off life support or had died.  The parents would definitely find out and be even more devastated finding out that op had the say in hubbies end of life care.", "I\u2019m honestly dumbfounded by this .... of course it\u2019s her responsibility. Her husband has been in a serious car accident, laying in a hospital bed & she is his wife! She needs to make his medical decisions.\n\nWho cares about parents reaction at this point?? Why would that be anywhere near close to important in this situation?? \u201cHey parents sorry you\u2019re hearing this right now but we are married & that\u2019s my husband laying in that bed so the staff will need to speak to me\u201d.", "It\u2019s the one time & one place she has to tell people.... the guy is in the hospital. She\u2019s his wife! The staff & doctors need to know that.", "Exactly! It\u2019s not OP\u2019s problem her husband lied to them. Never mind that ... the hospital needs to know this information!!!!", "it seems OP respected her husband enough to not go against his wishes since he claimed things were complicated and he would introduce her. If my partner said they did not wish for me to meet their family yet for my own benefit, i would trust that it would be done for good reason, but i would also expect to be told exactly why this is as well, especially if the family is still in the picture.\n\nUnfortunately we don't know what the \"complicated\" part is so we can only speculate until OP provides some info, but clearly its not that serious considering husband is in contact with them and was more mad OP continued his own charade of hiding her. Again, only speculating, but if the reason for hiding her wasn't for her protection or because husband has a grudge against the family, it sounds like the husband has something to hide or be ashamed of that would come out if the wife was introduced and got talking long enough with the family.", "Or things could have gotten differently weird -family could refuse to believe her.", "You\u2019re all over these comments defending the husband and deliberately misunderstanding the point, which is that the husband should have told his family about his wife a long time ago. Yes, the wife is his next of kin and that\u2019s important for the hospital to know, but this entire situation could have been avoided had the husband grown a pair and told his family. He put his wife in a very sticky situation, and it\u2019s not her responsibility to clean up his mess."]}
