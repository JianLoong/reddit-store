It is on him to tell them about your marriage. It sucks that he put you in that situation, honestly.  Why is he hiding you?", "NTA- but why on earth would you marry someone who is too cowardly to tell their family that they're getting married?

How in gods name was it your responsibility to tell HIS family that you're his wife?", "NTA what the fuck were you supposed to say? Your entire relationship he hid you from his family and even when married he still tried to hide you. You rock for trying to keep that up because why would you think he wanted anything else? As if telling them in the hospital was the \"right time\". He and his friends are wack. It's his secret he wanted to hide so it's his obligation to be the one to tell his family.

It is not your job to take the hit for him. You didn\u2019t make the choice to lie, but you\u2019re the one who the rage was directed at.

This is entirely his part to play. What are they even thinking? This isn't a normal situation.. he was hiding this from his family and wanted time to disclose it to them.

Family is tricky... I get that.\n\nStill, it's HIS family, and HE was the one that didn't want to tell them. You abided by your husband's wishes, as you had for the past four months. It's reasonable for you maintain that, since you weren't able to defer to him. That's not your fault.\n\nIf the family wants to be mad at you because they don't want to be mad at a hurt person, and you allow it, that's a noble sacrifice on your end, but **you will need to sit hubs down and lay everything out, and get this all straightened out after he's released**. It's out, so he needs to come clean to his family on why he wanted it to be kept secret, so that you don't have to live the rest of your life as the one that secretly stole someone away from the family, or some asinine theory like that that aunties and uncles come up with when they don't know all the info.", "NTA - This is a really odd situation. He hid the relationship completely.. So how could you be expected to assume that calling yourself his girlfriend would be better than saying you\u2019re his friend?", "NTA: Your husband didn't want to tell his family and probably still wouldn't have told them if it weren't for the accident.\n\nYou were never really told why so no one should blame you for not wanting to tell them at the hospital.", "NTA\n\nYou simply covered for the story your husband made HIMSELF toward his family. He brought upon himself the fallout of that story...", "NTA. Your husband created this drama by shirking HIS responsibility to set things straight with his family in the first place. NONE of it was your responsibility to clean up. You were within your 'rights' either way - to tell them yourself, or to leave it up to him - because his being unconscious in the hospital creates a legal situation for you. As his WIFE, all the decision making is YOURS, but his family wouldn't know that.  You leaned toward keeping HIS desired pretense until he was ready to disclose it; and had to make a snap decision without his input. You did just fine, and I stress that this is entirely a mess that HE created with his poor choices - so when everything settles back down, he should be apologizing for putting you in this situation in the first place.", "NTA. \n\nHe'd repeatedly put off telling his parents, and if you'd told them the truth before his accident he would undoubtedly have got mad at you for that.\n\nThis was an emergency situation, but I can still understand why you hesitated to tell the parents you were married.\n\nHe shouldn't be mad at you, because the only reason you were initially lying was due to his own behavior in not being honest with them.", "EsH .  Your husband is for this subterfuge and putting you in this position,  you  were an asshole to yourself for going along with it in the first place and being treated like some dirty little secret.  \n\nThe parents may be assholes as well but you didn\u2019t give any info as to the reason for whole charade", "ESH\n\nIt definitely was your husband\u2019s responsibility however he\u2019s in the hospital after a serious accident.... seems like a good time to mention that since you would be the person making his medical decisions.\n\nThe dude is in the hospital & everyone is worried more about his parents reaction to y\u2019all being married than the guy laying in the bed?

This is all on him and I would dig a little deeper into why he thought he had to keep your marriage a secret.", "There\u2019s quite a lot going on here that doesn\u2019t make sense on either side.\n\nNTA\n\nWhatever\u2019s going on is not your responsibility to clean up, fix, and/or somehow figure out with no information.\n\nThough it is INCREDIBLY suspicious and definitely worrying. After all, someone keeping a double life isn\u2019t particularly trustworthy. He\u2019s happy lying to them for unknown reasons, what is he lying about to you?", "NTA but it's super sus that your husband isn't telling them you're married. Something is going on.", "Info: in this situation, you, not the family, would be making medical decisions for your unconscious husband. How did they not find out from NOT being allowed to talk to the doctor?", "Wtf imagine being held responsible for the lies of your husband. Wtf did you marry? NTA but also what is going on.", "imagine how the wife feels YIKES", "You married a man who wanted to keep you a secret. And that red flag made you go \u201che\u2019s perfect!\u201d? Even after he lied about introducing you? NTA He can clean up his own messes.", "i personally would not have married someone who felt the need to keep me a secret. i don\u2019t think yta, simply because you could have just told them yourselves and not thought of your husband first. you thought of him and wanted him to be able to tell his family. i would\u2019ve spilled the beans right then and there", "YTA.  You're omitting key details in a story that are kind of important for anyone to get a clear picture one way or the other. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd for that, YTA.", "INFO: why did you marry this guy with such glaring red flags waving about?", "ESH,\nWhat if things had taking a turn for the worst line going into a comma?  His parents would have thought they had the right/responsibility to make his health care decisions.  It would have really blown up then!", "NTA.  You did your best to uphold your husband's wishes, and it's on him for not resolving it sooner.", "NTA, the onus is on the husband,  it his his family, he never told them he got married, told you relationships are complex. Given that I'd assume somethings wrong and would have likely reacted the same way you did.  The friend is also bogus because if they know the family they could've acted as a mediators and said, hey she introduced herself like that because  X never told you all he got married, but that's his wife", "INFO: are you a different race/culture?", "NTA but this is some messed up stuff - why would you ever marry someone without even talking to his family? The guy could have some serious issues and you just trusted him.", "NTA, sounds like you were doing your best to honor the relationship he was comfortable with his family thinking you had.  Idk what the complications in his relationship with his family are, but I hope you all get them worked out when your husband recovers, so the discovery of your marriage doesn't taint your relationship with his family forever.", "NTA. He put up strange boundaries. You did the best you could to honor them when he was unable to weigh in.", "NTA\n\nIt's his complicated relationship with his family. You're not throwing him under the bus. He's dodging his responsibility and he's still trying to blame you (the \"why didn't you say gf\" thing).", "His friend called me and them. \n\nFrom what he's said, his relationship with them isn't exactly bad but they want him to live a very specific life. I think he's spent so long letting them think he is the person they want him to be that he keeps things from them that would shatter that illusion of him because it's easier.", "Emergency contact info? Just a guess, but it's a fair question.", "i did find that a little weird but honestly even if they are distant when a family member is in the hospital you show up, atleast in my family", "Siblings?", "Yeah I did more extreme and moved countries, but my GF I met over there was my emergency contact. The only way of them knowing if he did not update his ICE or the \"friend\" told them.", "Judging from OP's replies, husband seems really suspicious.", "When you're at the point you're husband is injured, unconscious, in hospital, surrounded by his family who are trying to figure out who you are and why you're walked into what is usually a family moment, that's the time to rip off the plaster, \"I'm his wife. He didn't want to tell you we got married. I don't know why, you'll have to ask him when he's conscious. But I'm his wife, that's why I'm staying by his side\". \n\nI cannot imagine being his family, being worried about your relative, having his friend introduce herself and hang around, only to find out she's his wife and during an serious health emergency her priority was keeping up the deceit, the lie by omission.", "[removed]", "Maybe its just as simple as he had an ex who they hoped someday he would get back together with.", "For a while, I dated a guy whose parents would have hit the roof if he was dating a white girl. Completely not allowed. I was always \"his friend from school,\" and we were together for years. We talked about getting married eventually and he just couldn't wrap his head around how that would go. Probably poorly, tbh. He ended up marrying within his family's culture down the road. \n\nNot saying that's for sure happening here, but families can be complicated. OP is NTA. Husband has no right to be mad. He should be bearing the brunt of his secret marriage, not her.", "It doesn't have to be malicious.\n\nI'm in contact with my parents but they're on a severe information diet. They would find out if something put me in the hospital through my brother, but he does not to tell them anything personal.\n\nThey didn't meet my girlfriend until we were together for over 2 years and have only met her a handful of times since then. It has nothing to do with her and everything to do with how dysfunctional my relationship with my parents is.\n\nHe's an asshole still for blaming OP. It's his family dynamic, how he handled it is on him.", "Honestly, my first thought was \"who isn't white in this situation\" bc I'm betting it's not the husband's family \\*side eye\\*", "This does not speak well of his character.", "Are you both men?\n\nEdit: nevermind I see the comment about girlfriend now.", "You could be in an episode of  \"I'm in a secret relationship\".\n\nHow long have you known your husband and why did you agree to marry him without his family even knowing about you?", "So your husband is living a double life? Honey, open your eyes.", "He sounds cowardly. Being unable to not present the perfect version of himself that his parents want is concerning.", "OK, but if you told them you were \"a friend\" then THEY had the rights to information from the hospital and you did NOT. You put yourself and your husband in an untenable position. What if they had given instructions to the hospital do do something, or not do something, that your husband would disagree with?\n\nAnd if he'd died? And they wanted to do a funeral against what you wanted? That's a bad time to whip out a marriage license and say \"Ah HA! You can't do that! I'm the wife!\" Or worse, they take care of the body and the funeral arrangements and don't even tell you.", "It\u2019s her responsibility to tell the hospital staff that she\u2019s his wife so they deal with her. She\u2019s under absolutely no obligation to explain to his family what he should\u2019ve told them four months ago. She wouldn\u2019t have been wrong if she did, but he has no right to be mad that she didn\u2019t. If he cared so much, he should\u2019ve told them any time in the four months prior to the accident.\n\nEdit: typed years when I meant months", "Why is he lying to them? Is it because there would be severe and irrevocable consequences? Would violence occur?\n\nA secret wife is not a minor thing. If he\u2019s that adamant on keeping the secret then there\u2019s a chance that it would be INCREDIBLY unwise to let the cat out of the bag.\n\nThe husband being injured and hospitalized is the worst time to trigger the ultimate family drama.\n\nAfter all, it could be because he\u2019s a spineless coward too afraid of disapproval to come clean. Or it could be because his family is horribly abusive and he\u2019s trying to completely cut them out. It could be lots of things, the safe option is to not throw those die and keep the current status quo. AKA, maintain the lie in the absence of further information.", "Where does it say she wasn\u2019t honest with the hospital staff?", "Did you even read the post or nah", "This isn\u2019t a shitty Sandra Bullock rom-com. The hospital doesn\u2019t get their relationship chart from what she tells the parents, they get it from what she tells the hospital. Which does include keeping said relationship quiet, hospitals are happy to lie to avoid disruptive drama.", "That\u2019s a terrible reason to hide the person you plan on spending your life with", "\u2026that doesn\u2019t make it better.", "a very good case yeah. though a difference i'm seeing here is your SO told you why you had to be a secret in no uncertain terms. Good communication. However from the sound of the post OP was kept in the dark herself about his exact reasons. Something she really should have asked about and gotten clear answers for as soon as she was told it would be a secret tbh, but hiding the SO and being vague or evasive about the reasons together is extremely suspicious.", "My thoughts were this might have something to do with race/ethnicity etc.", "a very good point, however the wording of the post suggests OP was never exactly told the reasons for the secrecy by the husband and never got straight answers. Anyone has the right to and should immediately know the reasons for being hidden from their SO's friends or family. When the SO fails to provide that reason or avoids the question, that's suspicious and indicative that there is something about the SO that they need to hide from everyone.", "But that's a girlfriend, not a wife. I get not inviting them to the wedding. But at least tell them you're married", "It sounds so much like the situation people from India face were parent's have a lot more say and sway on their kids lives.  In which it makes Lot of sense. Doesn't make it right, but it makes sense", "I thought this, too.", "Nah, husband's had never told his family,  idk if I'd feel comfortable declaring m his wife. Also the onus  is completely on the husband he should be mad at himself.", "I completely agree, OP should be aware of the why for it all and should be onboard. I can also see why you are under that impression.\n\n\nPesonally I think this from the post:\n\n>he didn\u2019t want them to ruin things between us\n\nAnd this comment from OP:\n\n>From what he's said, his relationship with them isn't exactly bad but they want him to live a very specific life. I think he's spent so long letting them think he is the person they want him to be that he keeps things from them that would shatter that illusion of him because it's easier. \n\nShows that he did share his fears with her. And that comment specifically resonates with me a lot since it's very similar to my own relationship with my parents.", "You must have normal parents. For dysfunctional parents, they can't complain about what they don't know.", "I have been with her for 7 years at this point and I know for a fact I won't tell my parents about the marriage until some time after it has happened.", "But if your parents were verbally abusing you about it would you even entertain them? Why isn\u2019t OP just blocking them\u2026it seems like he has a different relationship with his parents than you", "And how do you think that will end up if you are injured or worse and your parents still think they are your next of kin? What kind of shit is your current gf / then wife going to have to deal with because of that?", "I'm not saying he does have the same relationship as me, I'm just providing an example from my personal life where a person wouldn't tell their family about their partner.\n\nNot because of anything to do with the partner, but because of an unusual or dysfunctional relationship with their family. The comment I initially responded to jumped to the conclusion that the husband was ashamed of OP, but from what I am reading I just see him as having a complicated relationship with his family.\n\n\"Just block them\" makes it sounds so simple and easy when in reality that is a very hard choice to make and stick with.", "Do I need to share more of my personal life or can I just say that none of that is an issue in my case?\n\nI'm not looking for feedback on how I live my life, just trying to provide a different perspective that seems applicable in this story.", "As long as your GF/wife knows and is prepared, I think it's odd but your choice. I just wouldn't want to have to go home and find a marriage license to prove I'm next of kin because my in-laws have every right to believe it's them and want to be the ones making decisions. If he didn't want to tell them, he could send a postcard or something. Someone in his family should have known.", "So why bring it up. \n\nHere is this thing that I say. \n\n*People question it*\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about thing that I\u2019ve said. Just accept it\u2019s true* \n\nYea. Sure.", "She knows. She also has her own weird family dynamic that wouldn't be happy if they found out I was making the decisions and not them. We have found our own way of managing things.\n\nAgain, all I'm saying is let's not just jump to the conclusion that the guy is ashamed of the person he married when it's far more likely he has an atypical relationship with his family.", "That\u2019s one of my questions: like we\u2019re OP\u2019s husband\u2019s parents making medical decisions until \u201cthe big reveal?\u201d If his family dynamic is messy why would he want that? What if he was seriously incapacitated - he\u2019s just ok then dumping all of this on the wife? That\u2019s pretty selfish.", ">\u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about thing that I\u2019ve said. Just accept it\u2019s true\"\n\nI did not say that, you're twisting my words. I'll rephrase it for you.\n\nDo you really need to hear my life story for this to make sense to you, or can you just accept that people are unique with different lived experiences and relationship dynamics?", "You're very much right here, but everyone seems to be just glossing over what you're saying, or misinterpreting your words.\n\nSuffice to say that my wife's relationship with her parents is extremely complicated, and despite being with her for 14 years, I've only met her dad twice, so I can appreciate the atypical relationship with family angle.\n\nIt's definitely abnormal for OP's husband not to have told his family, but not so bizarre for me to think he's hiding something or ashamed of his partner."]}
