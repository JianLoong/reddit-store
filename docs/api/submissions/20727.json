It is on him to tell them about your marriage. It sucks that he put you in that situation, honestly.  Why is he hiding you?", "NTA- but why on earth would you marry someone who is too cowardly to tell their family that they're getting married?

How in gods name was it your responsibility to tell HIS family that you're his wife?", "NTA what the fuck were you supposed to say? Your entire relationship he hid you from his family and even when married he still tried to hide you. You rock for trying to keep that up because why would you think he wanted anything else? As if telling them in the hospital was the \"right time\". He and his friends are wack. It's his secret he wanted to hide so it's his obligation to be the one to tell his family. He's the reason you're a secret in the first place so why the fuck would it be your job to have to face that confrontation?

It is not your job to take the hit for him. You didn\u2019t make the choice to lie, but you\u2019re the one who the rage was directed at.

Geez this dude is spineless and seems as tho he's great at shirking accountability. His friend too. NTA.", "NTA. Seriously? Your husband and his best friend expected you to tell his family? This is entirely his part to play. What are they even thinking? This isn't a normal situation.. he was hiding this from his family and wanted time to disclose it to them.

Family is tricky... I get that.\n\nStill, it's HIS family, and HE was the one that didn't want to tell them. You abided by your husband's wishes, as you had for the past four months. It's reasonable for you maintain that, since you weren't able to defer to him. That's not your fault.\n\nIf the family wants to be mad at you because they don't want to be mad at a hurt person, and you allow it, that's a noble sacrifice on your end, but **you will need to sit hubs down and lay everything out, and get this all straightened out after he's released**. It's out, so he needs to come clean to his family on why he wanted it to be kept secret, so that you don't have to live the rest of your life as the one that secretly stole someone away from the family, or some asinine theory like that that aunties and uncles come up with when they don't know all the info.", "NTA - This is a really odd situation. He hid the relationship completely.. So how could you be expected to assume that calling yourself his girlfriend would be better than saying you\u2019re his friend?", "NTA: Your husband didn't want to tell his family and probably still wouldn't have told them if it weren't for the accident.\n\nYou were never really told why so no one should blame you for not wanting to tell them at the hospital.", "NTA\n\nYou simply covered for the story your husband made HIMSELF toward his family. He brought upon himself the fallout of that story...", "NTA. Your husband created this drama by shirking HIS responsibility to set things straight with his family in the first place. NONE of it was your responsibility to clean up. You were within your 'rights' either way - to tell them yourself, or to leave it up to him - because his being unconscious in the hospital creates a legal situation for you. As his WIFE, all the decision making is YOURS, but his family wouldn't know that.  You leaned toward keeping HIS desired pretense until he was ready to disclose it; and had to make a snap decision without his input. You did just fine, and I stress that this is entirely a mess that HE created with his poor choices - so when everything settles back down, he should be apologizing for putting you in this situation in the first place.", "NTA. \n\nHe'd repeatedly put off telling his parents, and if you'd told them the truth before his accident he would undoubtedly have got mad at you for that.\n\nThis was an emergency situation, but I can still understand why you hesitated to tell the parents you were married.\n\nHe shouldn't be mad at you, because the only reason you were initially lying was due to his own behavior in not being honest with them.", "EsH .  Your husband is for this subterfuge and putting you in this position,  you  were an asshole to yourself for going along with it in the first place and being treated like some dirty little secret.  \n\nThe parents may be assholes as well but you didn\u2019t give any info as to the reason for whole charade", "ESH\n\nIt definitely was your husband\u2019s responsibility however he\u2019s in the hospital after a serious accident.... seems like a good time to mention that since you would be the person making his medical decisions.\n\nThe dude is in the hospital & everyone is worried more about his parents reaction to y\u2019all being married than the guy laying in the bed?

September rolled around and my grandmother had a terrible stomachache. A trip to the ER with my grandfather determined it was appendicitis, and she needed emergency surgery. My grandfather called her parents to come to the hospital, and they were almost excited to be able to use this new health insurance thing they\u2019d been paying for. My grandfather informed them that they\u2019d been married a few months, and she was in fact his dependent. Her parents were huge softies and decided they\u2019d pay for her college anyway. Her older sister, who had been dating her intended since freshman year of high school and was waiting another year at least to marry, was pissed until she was offered the same adjusted conditions.", "I don't know if there is a cultural difference here, but I went to college with a bunch of first generation Americans of Indian descent (their parents had immigrated from India but the students themselves were born and raised in the US), and pretty much all of them dated in college (including some with serious boyfriends/girlfriends) and almost none of them told their parents because of cultural expectations.", "I won't lie, until I read \"girlfriend\", I was thinking that OP was perhaps male. Knowing that OP is female, my concern becomes that they are of different races or religious backgrounds. =/ Not that it's any better. \n\nHe's the one who set the tone for how much information his parents get, OP respected that, so definitely NTA. Even if she had told them, they would still be mad, and OP's husband would still likely blame her for telling them instead of keeping it quiet. He put her in a no-win situation.", "I mean, if they only got married 4 months ago, and haven't told anyone, do you think he went in and updated his next of kin or POA info at the hospital?", "THIS. If their relationship is that strained, you\u2019d think they\u2019d get a text after he was released and they wouldn\u2019t even be there.", "Best response!!", "I had a partner who kept insisting that he was \"working on\" introducing me to his parents. Guess who was married. Or still is, but he was then too.", ">My guesses are husband is ashamed of or embarrassed by OP in some way that either he hasn't brought up to her directly or would only apply around family.\n\nI'll take \"mixed race couple\" for 100, Alex.", "Oh he's hiding something.", "[removed]", "and you're, what? fine with being his dirty little secret? it was absolutely not your job to deal with his family, but you also should have never gotten married until he grew a spine and told them the truth. this was such a preventable situation", "This is called avoidant attachment. You should look up how to deal with it.\n\nNTA", "suspect? or suspicious?", "To be fair to OP, she was in a highly stressful situation where maintaining \u2018the peace\u2019/the status quo might have seemed like the best option at the time. I\u2019m the kind of person who doesn\u2019t outwardly react emotionally to this type of situation at all, instead I kind of switch off, and I could totally see myself just defaulting to, \u2018Hi I am friend\u2019 and focusing on the charade rather than the emotional emergency during this too.\n\nThis is one of those situations where there isn\u2019t a great option, as the other side of the coin is - why rip off the band aid then when it would just add to the drama and upset of an emergency situation?\n\nI think she was damned if she did and damned if she didn\u2019t tbh.", "No it's not its his family. He decided to not tell them. That is alllllll him. It's not her job to fix it for him. She's a partner not a parent.", "u/Mysterious-Nose-68..To me, I think that if he broke up with his ex recently, then he gets married 4 months ago............it could be that the family thinks he's a serial cheater and doesn't like him for that reason.", "Or maybe she is not the ex, the OP is the sidewife", "Hell, my guess was \"gay couple; husband isn't out to his family\" until OP clarified that she's a woman. This seems the second most likely scenario.", "I would put race as more likely but religion is also very much on the table", "I don't think that's what it is. I am a white woman who has dated Black men. You have that conversation pretty openly.

My best friend was in a relationship for over 4-5 years and her partner _never_ told his parents about her or that he was even in a relationship at all. He and his family were Indian and I have heard of this happening in other cases. It wasn\u2019t even about them not accepting her because of her race, as his SIL was also white. \n\nMy friend asked him to tell them/introduce her so many times and he even kept saying he would (towards the end of their relationship) but then didn\u2019t. He actually moved out of his parents to live with my friend and her family, so who knows where he told them he lived, and one time (and one time only) after a night out them had actually gone back to his parents house and she had met his mother. She said the mum was really kind to her, but she was introduced as a friend. Just really strange and frustrating behaviour and honestly complete cowardice from the boyfriend/husband in OP\u2019s case.", "Good point.", "What's described is more like he's pretending to be someone he's not, for his parents' sake.

If he's in contact with his parents then their marriage SHOULD NOT be a secret (secret relationships are bad enough, nevermind a marriage...). I can't imagine getting married to someone who went \"honey, we just have to keep this a secret from my parents, whom I still talk to\"... because the next assumption I have is the same one for a lot of secret relationships, which is that there are sidepieces involved.", "Better make sure you have an advanced directive because if your parents get to the hospital before your wife, they may be making medical decisions for you that aren't what you want.", "Why do you assume that he is pretending to be someone that he is not, and that it is for the sake of his parents?\n\nI read this as him just not actively correcting his parents when they make erroneous assumptions that aren't worth the emotional effort to correct, given his apparent minimal relationship with him.\n\nBeyond that, I figure it is as likely to be for his own sake that he is doing this. Maybe he doesn't want to be cut off, or he doesn't want to start a flame war with members of his family that he would just as soon not actively deal with. I dunno. But certainly I didn't view him as a mommas boy who was ignoring what his wife wanted/needed because he was living a false life, for example.\n\nI was viewing this as a guy who is basically ignoring his parents altogether because they stress him out, but was contemplating trying to reconnect with them at some point in the future when he has the emotional energy to do so. \n\nAnd personally I would prefer to be married to someone that avoided confrontations rather than someone that exacerbates confrontations, but to each their own, ya know?
