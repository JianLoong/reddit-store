My son and DIL married when they were in college and soon had my grandbaby Shelly. Shelly is six years old. Before this Christmas, they lived in an apartment and didn\u2019t really decorate due to space. They would celebrate at my place and Shelly loves our tree. It\u2019s basically very bright with all the colors of the rainbow.\n\nThis year I thought it would be different since they bought a home. In the summer I bought some colorful Christmas ornaments for them since I know decorations are expensive.  I babysit every Tuesday and last Tuesday the tree was up. My son asked me to finish it if I wanted since both  parents were busy with work and didn\u2019t want the boxes to be out all week.\n\nSo that\u2019s what I did with Shelly, I put up every  ornament that was out. Along with the ones I bought there were a lot of dark colored ornaments. Shelly loved it and she spent a long time just looking at it.\n\nYesterday I came back and every single colorful ornament was off the tree, I asked Shelly what happens and her mom ( DIL) took them all off. She was got quite upset talking about it.  The tree is just dark with basically no color now.\n\nI waiting until both of the them got home and asked why she removed the ornament, her response was she didn\u2019t like how it looked. It was too overstimulating for Shelly (Shelly doesn\u2019t have any disabilities). I asked if she was serious and she told me she was. \n\nAt this point I asked if she was the color grinch since she destroyed something Shelly loved. She got really mad and I told her to put it back up for her daughter and she can deal with colors not matching in her home. She called me a jerk, my son is annoyed with me also since it\u2019s their home.\n\nI just can\u2019t understand why they would mess with something their daughter loved.\n\n\nEdit: I don\u2019t care that the tree isn\u2019t my vision, my issue is then taking away something Shelly loved because it didn\u2019t match her mothers vision.\n\nWho put their vision over their kids happiness", "created_utc": 1701870128, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18c4874/aita_for_asking_my_dil_if_she_is_the_color_grinch/", "score": 2439, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Oh and insulting her with the grinch color was putting you up there with other bad mother-in-laws. YTA.  You TOLD her what to do? Really? And she didn\u2019t tell you where you could go?

Let your DIL enjoy her Christmas tree, new home, and her aesthetic. Your DIL is a person too who gets to enjoy her Christmas.\n\nOut of curiosity, did your children choose your home decor growing up? Did your MIL tell you how to decorate? If the answer to these questions is no, then sit with why this standard should apply to your DIL.\n\nNo child was harmed because of their parent\u2019s choice of Christmas aesthetics.

Either you have other issues with DIL that you aren\u2019t mentioning or you are looking to start issues with DIL. \n\nIt is inevitable that you and DIL will have differing opinions. Guess what? Your opinions will not always be right! It sounds like this was a miscommunication; your son told you that you and Shelley could decorate the tree but you failed to mention that you were decorating with decorations YOU bought. Maybe if you had a good relationship with DIL, that wouldn\u2019t be a problem. But based on this post, you don\u2019t have a good relationship with DIL. And if I came home and my MIL had made changes to the way I decorate my home, even minor changes, without running that by me, I would also be pretty unhappy. \n\nThis is your DIL\u2019s home. She can decorate however she likes. Yes, maybe she was a little reactive and went a little too far in taking down the decorations. But the way to handle that would be to apologize and have an adult discussion. Maybe Shelley could hang the decorations she likes on the back of the tree. Or maybe you could buy Shelley a little tree for her room. \n\nBut you decided, for whatever reason, not to have an adult discussion. And however DIL felt about you before, I\u2019m guessing she likes you a whole lot less now. \n\nYou need to apologize to DIL. A sincere apology. And if you\u2019re clinging to the mindset that \u201cmother knows best\u201d, respectfully, let that go. You are not DIL\u2019s mother or Shelley\u2019s mother.

That poor child.", "You are - unintentionally - by imposing your desires in their home.\n\nI\u2019m sure it felt kind for you to do, and her reaction probably felt hurtful.

My son and DIL married when they were in college and soon had my grandbaby Shelly. Shelly is six years old. Before this Christmas, they lived in an apartment and didn\u2019t really decorate due to space. They would celebrate at my place and Shelly loves our tree. It\u2019s basically very bright with all the colors of the rainbow.\n\nThis year I thought it would be different since they bought a home. In the summer I bought some colorful Christmas ornaments since I know decoration are expensive.  I babysit every Tuesday and last Tuesday the tree was up. My son asked me to finish it if I wanted since both were busy with work and didn\u2019t want the boxes to be out all week.\n\nSo that\u2019s what I did with Shelly, I put up every  ornament that was out. Along with the ones I bought there were a lot of dark colored ornaments. Shelly loved it and she spent a long time just looking at it.\n\nYesterday I came back and every single colorful ornament was off the tree, I asked Shelly what happens and her mom took them all off. She was got quite upset talking about it.  The tree is just dark with basically no color now.\n\nI waiting until both of the them got home and asked why she removed the ornament, her response was she didn\u2019t like how it looked. It was too overstimulating for Shelly (Shelly doesn\u2019t have an disabilities). I asked if she was serious and she told me she was. \n\nAt this point I asked if she was the color grinch since she destroyed something Shelly loved. She got really mad and I told her to put it back up for my daughter and she can deal with colors not matching in her home. She called me a jerk, my son is annoyed with me also since it\u2019s their home.\n\nI just can\u2019t understand why they would mess with something their daughter loved.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Considering she is the kind of person who color coordinates her Christmas tree, I have a hard time believing she's a 0 fucks giver.", "And, I would think the parents might have more intimate knowledge of whether their own daughter has a disability or is overstimulated by things than the grandmother. Sometimes when I get overstimulated or overwhelmed, I shut down or freeze. Maybe, that is what the daughter was doing when she was looking at the tree. And, I can almost guarantee that dear old grandma was sitting there going \u201cisn\u2019t the tree pretty?\u201d \u201cDoesn\u2019t the tree look good?\u201d to the daughter and the daughter probably just didn\u2019t want to speak up and say anything to hurt her feelings.", "Yes. This. Also I know I have decorations sitting out for over a week whilst I figure out what else I need to make it look right and I would be PISSED if someone came and 'did it for me'. Son is completely the AH too for not checking with his wife who probably was trying to find the time but may actually enjoy decorating her own damn home.", "My tree looks like a family album exploded, my house looks like \u201cWhite Christmas\u201d. This isn\u2019t my aesthetic, but it\u2019s not my tree, my house or my kid. \n\nAnd it isn\u2019t OP\u2019s either.", "She's six. She doesn't care about the color scheme of the holiday decorations. OP is just marking her territory.", "The issue was ornaments OP just so happened to buy. Nota kids homemade ornament \n\nA lot of people have all of these projections about millennial women and beige and minimalism but literally we don\u2019t know if that was the case around all. All we know is DIL had \u2018darker\u2019 ornaments. Were OP\u2019s ornaments neon? Who knows? Doesn\u2019t matter. Your tree, your neon, or griege, or full goth, or whatever ornaments.", "That's what I was thinking too. Also, did son and ADIL have boxes of decorations they wanted out and OP decided that her ornaments belonged too? That would piss me off if I had ornaments set out and someone decided to throw their ornaments on my tree too", "100% this. \n\nOrnaments are not that expensive, they can be, but the basic ones come at affordable prices. So OPs can't really use that as an excuse. The grandchild is 6, so the parents probably have a handful of homemade ornaments or crafts. And can someone explain to me \"dark\" ornaments? I have a random assortment, and I grew up with a random assortment of ornaments. All of those ornaments (even the darker ones) can be seen on the on a green tree. So unless the Son and DIL are doing a themed tree that is intentionally using dark colors, which isn't stated, it sounds like OP doesn't like their taste.", "I\u2019m of two minds here. On the one hand, I agree that OP is overstepping. It\u2019s hard to know without more info how much she interferes outside of this instance, but certainly she went too far here. On the other hand\u2026there was one Christmas as a kid  where I got it into my head that the tree should be silver and blue only. My mom absolutely hated that idea (though she NEVER told me that, it just became clear once I was older and could put the context clues together). But she didn\u2019t want to crush my dreams, so she just\u2026bought two trees. Obviously that was a very privileged option - not everyone can afford even one tree, let alone two - but she managed to prioritize both of our desires/aesthetics. I do feel like there must be a middle ground here. If the OP is right that the child loved the brighter ornaments, then maybe there\u2019s another way to display them that honors both mom\u2019s vision and the child\u2019s joy. \n\n(For what it\u2019s worth: My tree was beautiful, but as an adult now, I see why Mom hated it as the primary tree. It was too\u2026perfect. Our family tree was always a hot mess, and my trees now follow the family theme.)", "By \u201cdarker\u201d she probably means \u201cmore muted.\u201d Which is fine.", "OP did not just put up the decorations her son left out. They also added the decorations they brought, and it seems that it was those deco that were removed.", "That\u2019s what I got, the ornament box was out and it had everything in it.", "I reread it and DIL also said that she didn\u2019t like it in addition to saying that it was overstimulating for her daughter so we actually do know how she feels about it.", "With the decorations they had. The point was if she wanted to decorate with what eas already in their boxes she could, that way she could do that with their daughter and he could get the boxes out of the way.\n\nShe mentions bringing her own to decorate the tree with and since DIL didn't completely strip the tree (just specific ornaments) I'm going to guess most of the ones that were removed are the ones she brought rather than ones that they made available to her.\n\nThere's a reason why both DiL AND her son are mad at her, let's be real here", "Her son is also upset with her though, so regardless if she was asked, she clearly overstepped.\n\nIMO, it's on par with suggesting someone can hang up stockings. But they decide to go overboard and decorate the whole mantle and fill the stockings.", "\u201cThey\u201d didn\u2019t, the son did. OP still isn\u2019t respectful of it being their home, their space, their choice.\n\nEdit: typo", "The issue is that OP took it upon herself to change the color scheme. She did not ask if she could add ornaments of her own. OP obviously did not like what DIL was doing, but that does not mean that it wasn't beautiful, or that it would ruin the child's Christmas. OP gets to decide what happens in her own home, DIL gets to decide what ornaments are used on her own tree.", "If a subdued Christmas tree is what spoils Christmas for the granddaughter, it couldn't have been much of a Christmas.", "So? Decorating a Christmas tree isn't anything permanent, and the people who actually own the home and live there can change it if they want to. The DIL didn't tell her MIL off for how she finished the tree, she just adjusted it to her liking. I don't see the problem there. What I do see is a MIL who is way overstepping her son and DIL's boundries. Keep going, and she'll just alienate herself from her son and his family.", "And she did, and they didn\u2019t even bring it up or get mad at her. They just removed the ornaments that didn\u2019t suit their home. Then MIL brought it up.", "It could be the kid was *too* interested in the colorful ornaments and kept trying to play with them. \n\nWe let the kids pick ornaments for the tree, so we have all kinds: firetruck, pineapple, ice cream cones, etc. But these are also the ones my 3yo tries to play with all the time. He leaves the more generic looking ones alone. \n\nNow I don't think that's what was happening, just that's its a possibility.", "I'd buy stuff for my kids tree. But it would probably be more towards their taste than mine. If she wants to be a Beige  Becky ok cool. Want these cool beige ornaments that are interesting shapes of your favorite things? No. Ok, moving right along. I'm not going to buy them and force them on the tree then emotionally blackmail them by dragging their child into it. This MIL is about to buy a one trip ticket to Banishment City.", ">Right off the bat I thought she was out of line buying ornaments for someone else\u2019s house without a thought as to whether they would appreciate it or not.\n\nOrnaments are not that expensive either. Yes, there are very nice pricey ones but those are usually what are given as a gift, and usually just the one. I would also love to know her definition of dark. Most ornaments aren't that dark because the tree is dark. Unless it was a fake white tree? Also, she bought them over the summer with the intention of giving them to the Son and DIL ... I can't be convinced OP isn't a buttinsky.", "Even if he DID that's not the problem.  The problem is she decorated, they took down the decorations they didn't want.  Instead of just letting it be, OP had a fit.  If OP had just done the decorating and put up her decorations but let it go when they got taken down OP wouldn't be an asshole.", "She gave them baubles during the year and they were left out along with the dark ones the DIL wanted to use. She wasn't carrying around baubles just in case she got asked to decorate a tree.\n\nDIL can decorate her tree how she likes, but OP did originally decorate it with decorations that were there. Some were there because she had bought them earlier in the year, but they were put out with the others for the tree.", ">I refuse to believe that the 6 year old ran into her grandmother's arms, upset that her gaudy decorations were removed.\n\nPerhaps you can point out where the OP said this ridiculous scenario", "\u201cMy toddler doesn\u2019t put these in her mouth, the spray paint is safe!\u201d \nYeah, I thought of that too", "I just learned about the sad beige mom phenomenon yesterday, and am amazed that it is actually a thing (the real tendency for only neutral colors among some people, not the hysterically funny Werner Herzog parodies). My son and DIL have gotten Montessori-type things for my grandkids, but also have lots of bright colors and Fisher-Price things. \n\nAre there genuinely mothers who think bright colors are somehow the enemy of healthy child development? Or is it really just their version of performance art?", "That was my thought too. I cannot fathom living in a beige home. And the kid is six, colors are necessary!", "I did not know about that! But I did immediately think of Susan Sarandon playing a former groupie to rock stars, who realizes that she's become the kind of middle-aged woman whose entire wardrobe is beige.", "Sad beige tree for a sad beige baby\ud83d\ude14", "I read it as \u201cI\u2019m going to do something that looks like a nice thing to do, but I know it will bug her, and then I can act like a victim\u201d", "As someone who didn't have a say for a long time in how the tree could be decorated, I am excited for you!!! Enjoy the heck outta that tree!", "Because DIL owns the home and is the mom?  Obviously she doesn't over rule her husband, they should AGREE TOGEATHER (which did not happen), but why would her child have more of a say than her?  Kids don't always have to get every little thing they want.  Would I personally prefer the fun tree?  Yes.  Would I personally prioritize my kid enjoying the tree?  Yes.  But this is not some sort of desperate need.  If having a boring department store style Christmas tree is really the hill she wants to die on and it matters that much to her, her kid is not going to die.", "One of the benefits of shared custody. We do white on adult weeks and coloured on kid weeks -\nDespite the kid being 17.", "Sounds like fun! I love that you include your kid in the creativity. Sounds like a lovely family with a cool mom.", "I hear you. I just think this situation wasn\u2019t about the child\u2019s feelings being hurt, but the MILs. And the MIL using the child as an excuse to force her DIL to do things her way.", "Omg was that the woman that spray painted it brown? \n\nBecause that was honestly depressing", "I\u2019m a sad beige mom at heart but I let my kids go nuts because I want them to be happy and expressive. ESH", "Toddlers put everything in their mouths, she\u2019s just lying or not observant or her kid is super sneaky.", "OP sounds like my grandmother. Who has used guilt to manipulate my father and aunt. I don't know if it was meant to play out they way you suggest, but if she is anything like my grandmother, she is really milking the victim card.", "I have a box of ornaments my mother sent me every year we were married. My daughter gets them all and any others she loves when she moves out :)", "Lol! I'm sure your tree is very beautiful, if not exactly to my personal taste \ud83d\ude01", "I used to include her in the creativity, now she's kind enough to include me! This year it's been folding origami parrots. We have so many but it's so much fun!", "This is kinda the route I take with our Christmas tree, actually. I have a tub of only silver and gold baubles, and then a bunch of colourful nerdy and sentimental kid-made stuff. All the cool and sentimental things stand out more because the rest of the tree isn't a riot of colour, and because the kids (teens) are in charge of decorating the tree, they get to put their favourites wherever they deem best. It's a star wars/marvel/dc/dr who/popsicle stick/paper disaster and I love it.", "That's what I do in my house.  Neutral for all the big, can't change easily stuff, but colours for cushions and other decor elements.  I can change it according to season, taste or change, or heck, I feel like something different.\n\nJust this week I've been talking to my youngest son (age 16) about changing our Christmas tree.  I feel like it's been gold red and other assorted brights for a long time, and I'm looking for a different vibe.  I'm thinking of pink, white and silver next year.  Part of the reason is that we are all more or less grown up now and can have different vibes and taste.  No young children anymore to want the colourful stuff.", "That is PERFECT!  It is a great way to keep special memories and not take up a lot of room in the house!", "Yeah but the kid in the post is six, not a newborn.", "thank you for the link!! that article was such an fun read! i\u2019m a physiology major and i absolutely LOVE to learn about cool little stuff like that.", "They just have to rebrand as a \"warrior mom\" of a developmentally delayed kid and milk that for internet points instead"]}
