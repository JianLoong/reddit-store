My son and DIL married when they were in college and soon had my grandbaby Shelly. Shelly is six years old. Before this Christmas, they lived in an apartment and didn\u2019t really decorate due to space. They would celebrate at my place and Shelly loves our tree. It\u2019s basically very bright with all the colors of the rainbow.\n\nThis year I thought it would be different since they bought a home. In the summer I bought some colorful Christmas ornaments for them since I know decorations are expensive.  I babysit every Tuesday and last Tuesday the tree was up. My son asked me to finish it if I wanted since both  parents were busy with work and didn\u2019t want the boxes to be out all week.\n\nSo that\u2019s what I did with Shelly, I put up every  ornament that was out. Along with the ones I bought there were a lot of dark colored ornaments. Shelly loved it and she spent a long time just looking at it.\n\nYesterday I came back and every single colorful ornament was off the tree, I asked Shelly what happens and her mom ( DIL) took them all off. She was got quite upset talking about it.  The tree is just dark with basically no color now.\n\nI waiting until both of the them got home and asked why she removed the ornament, her response was she didn\u2019t like how it looked. It was too overstimulating for Shelly (Shelly doesn\u2019t have any disabilities). I asked if she was serious and she told me she was. \n\nAt this point I asked if she was the color grinch since she destroyed something Shelly loved. She got really mad and I told her to put it back up for her daughter and she can deal with colors not matching in her home. She called me a jerk, my son is annoyed with me also since it\u2019s their home.\n\nI just can\u2019t understand why they would mess with something their daughter loved.\n\n\nEdit: I don\u2019t care that the tree isn\u2019t my vision, my issue is then taking away something Shelly loved because it didn\u2019t match her mothers vision.\n\nWho put their vision over their kids happiness", "created_utc": 1701870128, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18c4874/aita_for_asking_my_dil_if_she_is_the_color_grinch/", "score": 370, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Oh and insulting her with the grinch color was putting you up there with other bad mother-in-laws. YTA.  You TOLD her what to do? Really? And she didn\u2019t tell you where you could go?

Let your DIL enjoy her Christmas tree, new home, and her aesthetic. Your DIL is a person too who gets to enjoy her Christmas.\n\nOut of curiosity, did your children choose your home decor growing up? Did your MIL tell you how to decorate? If the answer to these questions is no, then sit with why this standard should apply to your DIL.\n\nNo child was harmed because of their parent\u2019s choice of Christmas aesthetics.

Either you have other issues with DIL that you aren\u2019t mentioning or you are looking to start issues with DIL. \n\nIt is inevitable that you and DIL will have differing opinions. Guess what? Your opinions will not always be right! It sounds like this was a miscommunication; your son told you that you and Shelley could decorate the tree but you failed to mention that you were decorating with decorations YOU bought. Maybe if you had a good relationship with DIL, that wouldn\u2019t be a problem. But based on this post, you don\u2019t have a good relationship with DIL. And if I came home and my MIL had made changes to the way I decorate my home, even minor changes, without running that by me, I would also be pretty unhappy. \n\nThis is your DIL\u2019s home. She can decorate however she likes. Yes, maybe she was a little reactive and went a little too far in taking down the decorations. But the way to handle that would be to apologize and have an adult discussion. Maybe Shelley could hang the decorations she likes on the back of the tree. Or maybe you could buy Shelley a little tree for her room. \n\nBut you decided, for whatever reason, not to have an adult discussion. And however DIL felt about you before, I\u2019m guessing she likes you a whole lot less now. \n\nYou need to apologize to DIL. A sincere apology. And if you\u2019re clinging to the mindset that \u201cmother knows best\u201d, respectfully, let that go. You are not DIL\u2019s mother or Shelley\u2019s mother.

That poor child.", "You are - unintentionally - by imposing your desires in their home.\n\nI\u2019m sure it felt kind for you to do, and her reaction probably felt hurtful.

My son and DIL married when they were in college and soon had my grandbaby Shelly. Shelly is six years old. Before this Christmas, they lived in an apartment and didn\u2019t really decorate due to space. They would celebrate at my place and Shelly loves our tree. It\u2019s basically very bright with all the colors of the rainbow.\n\nThis year I thought it would be different since they bought a home. In the summer I bought some colorful Christmas ornaments since I know decoration are expensive.  I babysit every Tuesday and last Tuesday the tree was up. My son asked me to finish it if I wanted since both were busy with work and didn\u2019t want the boxes to be out all week.\n\nSo that\u2019s what I did with Shelly, I put up every  ornament that was out. Along with the ones I bought there were a lot of dark colored ornaments. Shelly loved it and she spent a long time just looking at it.\n\nYesterday I came back and every single colorful ornament was off the tree, I asked Shelly what happens and her mom took them all off. She was got quite upset talking about it.  The tree is just dark with basically no color now.\n\nI waiting until both of the them got home and asked why she removed the ornament, her response was she didn\u2019t like how it looked. It was too overstimulating for Shelly (Shelly doesn\u2019t have an disabilities). I asked if she was serious and she told me she was. \n\nAt this point I asked if she was the color grinch since she destroyed something Shelly loved. She got really mad and I told her to put it back up for my daughter and she can deal with colors not matching in her home. She called me a jerk, my son is annoyed with me also since it\u2019s their home.\n\nI just can\u2019t understand why they would mess with something their daughter loved.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
