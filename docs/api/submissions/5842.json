Joelle has a daughter Sunny who was 4 and she's 6 now. I'm 16m. For the last 8 months Sunny has been getting really bad nightmares at night and when she gets scared she always wants to get into my bed. I have never let her. For me it's weird and I don't want to have her right next to me. That feels like something you'd do for a little sibling, and I know she's my stepsister, but I don't think about her like just a sibling. I don't love her. I don't want her cuddling me or expecting that from me. But the last month, since her nightmares got a whole lot worse, Joelle has been on my ass about sending Sunny away and leaving her to cry in her room. I told her she should tell her to go to her if she's having nightmares. But I'm not going to let her in my bed. Dad asked me if we could compromise. Like would I sleep on the floor in my room or hers and give her comfort that way. I asked why it has to be me. He said because Sunny seeks me out and clearly she finds comfort in me being close. I told him I do not want to be involved at all. Joelle jumps in and tells me that I should be doing all I can as a big brother and imagine how it must feel to Sunny, she must think I don't love her or accept her as my sister. I didn't argue about that. I just told them I did not want to have her in my bed or get out of my bed and sleep on the floor for her.\n\nChristmas was tense and the three of us are arguing all the time. Dad told me he really thinks I should do it. He told me he'll be extremely disappointed if I'm okay with just letting her suffer and not helping.\n\nAITA?\n\nSome INFO: Sunny's dad died before she was born. My mom died 8 years ago. Sunny is close to her mom and during the day she seeks her out a lot but at night she only seems to want me. I spend every second weekend at my maternal grandparents house and Joelle has wanted to stop that so Sunny has me here. But I made sure I could still go. Sometimes I consider moving in with them so Sunny can't come to me every night.", "created_utc": 1672223770, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zx6fsy/aita_for_not_letting_my_little_stepsister_climb/", "score": 163, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If you not showing her comfort after nightmares is saying you don\u2019t love her, then them not showing her comfort after nightmares is saying they don\u2019t love her. I feel bad for both you and Sunny :( that lil one needs to feel safe. Also you say she seeks her mom out a lot? Does she go to school? Any reason to suspect anyone is abusing her? What are her nightmares about? Sad to think about but is it possible you are one of the only positive older people in her life?", "NTA. She is not your child and your stepmom and dad are putting the expectation on you to deal with something they should be handling. Poor kid.", "You aren't the parent, tell Joelle to parent her child. NTA.", "NTA \n\nJoelle should be taking care of her daughter not expect a teenager to do it . \n\nI am not sure why your parents expect to have  bonding when you barrely meet (im guesing about 3 or 4 years )  and are not even close in age (to have conv or activities together)\n\nThe whole nightmare issue might need  a specialist (therapy maiby ? )  but this cant go on ,for the welbeing of Sunny  .", "NTA. Even if you were okay with it, they should still be redirecting her back to them for comfort after a nightmare. This is a *parent's* responsibility to handle.\n\nForcing you to do all of this for Sunny isn't going to improve your relationship. Actually it's a pretty cruel thing to do to both of you. Cruel to you because you're repetitively being put in a situation you've been very clear makes you uncomfortable. Cruel to Sunny, because she thinks your relationship is very different than what it actually is.\n\nAlso, interesting how they never once seem to consider your needs and wants as valid.", "NTA Sunny has a parent whose duty it is to care for her. That person isn't you. When adults remarry and try to force step kids to have certain relationships, it often doesn't work. Your dad says \"compromise\", but there is only a compromise if both parties are gaining something, and your dad is asking you to make your own life worse in return for nothing. Why doesn't your dad compromise? He can take care of Sunny when she's scared.\n\nIt is notable that Joelle is ignoring her own daughter. That's terrible. Have they made you the unpaid babysitter yet?", "NTA\n\n\" I just told them I did not want to have her in my bed or get out of my bed and sleep on the floor for her.  \nChristmas was tense and the three of us are arguing all the time. Dad told me he really thinks I should do it. He told me he'll be extremely disappointed if I'm okay with just letting her suffer and not helping.\"\n\nAsk your dad if he is going to clear your name in future when Sunny tells people that her stepbrother who is 10 years older than her cuddled her every night?  Or she mentions it at school and then CPS etc are informed?  You are 16 years old - you wake up after a wet dream and Sunny's PJ.s are covered in your DNA?!?!?!?!?", "NTA. I think you're doing the right thing.", "NTA \n\nStick to your boundaries you aren\u2019t the kid\u2019s parent. Instead of your dad and stepmom figuring out ways to help this child they want to stick you with the responsibility. Look into moving in with your grandparents if your dad doesn\u2019t start respecting your boundaries. This situation isn\u2019t going to get better unfortunately. They seem set on forcing you to be the big brother you don\u2019t feel you are which will only cause resentment on your part towards them.", "NTA and I would try to avoid staying with Dad as much as possible. Stepmom needs to parent her own child and it\u2019s really concerning she\u2019s not teaching her daughter appropriate boundaries and neglecting her daughter to the point that her daughter is seeking comfort from an older stepbrother/having nightmares. Not to mention, completely disrespecting your boundaries.Her daughter should be comforted by her own mother, not a 16 year old stepbrother. Stepmom and Dad need to parent,not OP.", "NTA.\n\nIt's perfectly valid that you are uncomfortable letting her into your bed. I'd probably feel the same.\n\nAnd even as her brother, this really isn't your responsibility, it is your parents'.\n\nThat Joelle tries to keep you here for that is crazy. She has no right to do that. And 6 year olds can be difficult, but if your parents had also enforced that she should come to them and not you, you probably wouldn't even be having this problem to begin with.\n\nI would sit down with them, or at least your father, if you can and try to make that clear to them. It's pretty crazy that you feel like you have to move out just so you can be left alone at night.", "NTA\n\nAnd if her nightmares are increasing in frequency and intensity, she needs to see a doctor and her mother is an asshole for not recognizing that.\n\nYou are not the parent, your stepmother is.\n\nWhile I find it sad that you don't care for the child, I understand it.", "NTA.  This is not your responsibility. I would consider having a trusted adult talk to them, like your grandparents or a counselor.  This is unfair to you AND to the little one.\n\nSo for where I am coming from... My stepson and youngest (a daughter) have almost your age gap. It is a bit different because I have been in his life since age 2, and she is a half sibling not a step. He loves her a lot.  So basically they are closer than you and your step sister. \n\nIf my daughter wanted him in the night I would tell her no. If he overheard and was like, it's cool I'll comfort her, I would tell him no too.  Why would I not allow it while it would be much easier for me?  Because my husband and I are the parents here. A child's wake ups are the parents responsibility alone.  And kids - even teens - need and deserve rest and sleep.  You have this internet strangers green light to hold firm here.", "NTA. Sunny's mother should take care of Sunny and not try and parentify you. You are entitled to your bed and a good night's sleep. Comforting Joelle's child is not your job.", "If your family suggests you sleep on the floor again, talk to a trusted adult at your school. This is getting out of hand.\n\nNTA", "A compromise is you sleeping on the floor? Fuck off. Joelle is just trying to turn you into a free babysitter so she doesn\u2019t have to be a parent. If she didn\u2019t want a kid she should\u2019ve worn fucking protection NTA", "NTA.\n\nHonestly this situation is a little weird, especially with Sunny apparently insisting on only you at night. Personally I say go ahead and talk to your maternal grandparents and get the ball rolling on moving in with them. This is a kind of situation that very likely is only going to get worse and worse over time.", "NTA", "NTA. Spend as much time with your grandparents. Your  step mother and father are jokers.", "NTA, if you were closer in age, maybe, but she needs to go to her mother. Your not the parent and you aren't xomfortable in doing this", "ESH -But a very gentle one for you as I\u2019m not surprised you have problems with Sunny, given what your dad and stepmother are forcing onto you.\n\nI think you keeping your stepsister at arms length is never going to help your relationship, as is othering her the way you do.\n\nHowever, expecting a 16 year old boy to let his six year old sister sleep in his bed with him is really weird and inappropriate, as is your stepmum handing over responsibility for comforting her kid over to you. It sounds like she just doesn\u2019t want to be woken up, TBH.\n\nAlso her interfering in your relationship with your grandparents so that you can essentially provide free childcare is unacceptable.\n\nCould it be that you resent your sister because this has all been put into your shoulders?\n\nShe clearly idolises you, so try to build a relationship with her but also, stick to your boundaries.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

She's 6 years old and has been getting nightmares almost every night for eight months? That is not normal. Unless there is some easily explained environmental factor (she's being shown inappropriate horror movies, etc) that can be fixed, she needs to be seen by a professional.

She's not your sister just because your dad married her mom, and they can't force you to love her. The more they try the less you're going to like her.

Nightmares are not normal with that much frequency. Is no one asking about why she's having a them or why she's only seeking out you as opposed to her mom? Is she scared of your dad?", "I think it would be a good idea to speak to your grandparents about this issue. Your 16 and things won\u2019t change. Unfortunately your dad wants them to be happy even if it makes you uncomfortable. The fact that your stepmom wants to alienate you from your grandparents it\u2019s a red flag and you def need to not only put a stop to it but let your grandparents know about it. \nAlso I hate to be the one to say this but she could lie and say you did things to her daughter if she doesn\u2019t get her way so it\u2019s best to leave that situation and make sure you document the fact that u don\u2019t want nor feel comfortable with her sleeping in your bed.", "NTA. I good compromise (if you want to) is set up a blanket on the floor for her to sleep in if she has nightmares. Or you could build her a \"safe fort\" in her room. So, when she has nightmares, she can go to her safe fort. You can make with blankets and put like a blanket bed on the floor with stuffed animals. She prolly looks up to you. Thinks your her protector. IMO I would be flattered. But, this is only if you want to do it. Not saying you have to or should.", "Nta but....\nI get your opinion.  110% i think its better she not be in your bed bc that could lead to a host if other issues down the road. Her parents should tell her to come to them. \nThat all being said shes young enough to not understand the difference between brother and step brother.  She obviously loves you and feels emotionally that you will protect her.  Thats a good thing even if you \"dont love her\"   \nShes bonded with you and looks at you 100% as her family and finds comfort in that so its not a terrible thing. Find a work around. Let her sleep on a mattress on the floor or make a pillow bed for her so shes in the same room? This will allow her to feel close and protected but still give u distance.\nJust remember this girl is a part of your family wether u like it or not... dont alienate her and destroy her when shes only looking to feel safe. Be happy, hell be proud, that she thinks so highly of you.", "Reading through the comments, I think you've already been given a lot of good advice.\n\nThe only thing I'll add is that, if you haven't already, please tell your maternal grandparents about what is going on.  I'd even consider calling/texting/DMing your paternal grandparents to let them know about what exactly is going on.\n\nWhat is happening in your house is wrong.  It doesn't necessarily have to be caused by malicious intent, but there's some serious red flags here (continual nightmares for Sunny, refusal of her mom to be the comforter, putting this all on you) that need real consideration.
