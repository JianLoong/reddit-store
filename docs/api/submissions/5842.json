Joelle has a daughter Sunny who was 4 and she's 6 now. I'm 16m. For the last 8 months Sunny has been getting really bad nightmares at night and when she gets scared she always wants to get into my bed. I have never let her. For me it's weird and I don't want to have her right next to me. That feels like something you'd do for a little sibling, and I know she's my stepsister, but I don't think about her like just a sibling. I don't love her. I don't want her cuddling me or expecting that from me. But the last month, since her nightmares got a whole lot worse, Joelle has been on my ass about sending Sunny away and leaving her to cry in her room. I told her she should tell her to go to her if she's having nightmares. But I'm not going to let her in my bed. Dad asked me if we could compromise. Like would I sleep on the floor in my room or hers and give her comfort that way. I asked why it has to be me. He said because Sunny seeks me out and clearly she finds comfort in me being close. I told him I do not want to be involved at all. Joelle jumps in and tells me that I should be doing all I can as a big brother and imagine how it must feel to Sunny, she must think I don't love her or accept her as my sister. I didn't argue about that. I just told them I did not want to have her in my bed or get out of my bed and sleep on the floor for her.\n\nChristmas was tense and the three of us are arguing all the time. Dad told me he really thinks I should do it. He told me he'll be extremely disappointed if I'm okay with just letting her suffer and not helping.\n\nAITA?\n\nSome INFO: Sunny's dad died before she was born. My mom died 8 years ago. Sunny is close to her mom and during the day she seeks her out a lot but at night she only seems to want me. I spend every second weekend at my maternal grandparents house and Joelle has wanted to stop that so Sunny has me here. But I made sure I could still go.

If you not showing her comfort after nightmares is saying you don\u2019t love her, then them not showing her comfort after nightmares is saying they don\u2019t love her. I feel bad for both you and Sunny :( that lil one needs to feel safe. Also you say she seeks her mom out a lot? Does she go to school? Any reason to suspect anyone is abusing her? What are her nightmares about? Sad to think about but is it possible you are one of the only positive older people in her life?", "NTA. She is not your child and your stepmom and dad are putting the expectation on you to deal with something they should be handling. Poor kid.", "You aren't the parent, tell Joelle to parent her child. NTA.", "NTA \n\nJoelle should be taking care of her daughter not expect a teenager to do it . \n\nI am not sure why your parents expect to have  bonding when you barrely meet (im guesing about 3 or 4 years )  and are not even close in age (to have conv or activities together)\n\nThe whole nightmare issue might need  a specialist (therapy maiby ? )  but this cant go on ,for the welbeing of Sunny  .", "NTA. Even if you were okay with it, they should still be redirecting her back to them for comfort after a nightmare. This is a *parent's* responsibility to handle.\n\nForcing you to do all of this for Sunny isn't going to improve your relationship. Actually it's a pretty cruel thing to do to both of you. Cruel to you because you're repetitively being put in a situation you've been very clear makes you uncomfortable. Cruel to Sunny, because she thinks your relationship is very different than what it actually is.\n\nAlso, interesting how they never once seem to consider your needs and wants as valid.", "NTA Sunny has a parent whose duty it is to care for her. That person isn't you. When adults remarry and try to force step kids to have certain relationships, it often doesn't work. Your dad says \"compromise\", but there is only a compromise if both parties are gaining something, and your dad is asking you to make your own life worse in return for nothing. Why doesn't your dad compromise? He can take care of Sunny when she's scared.\n\nIt is notable that Joelle is ignoring her own daughter. That's terrible. Have they made you the unpaid babysitter yet?", "NTA\n\n\" I just told them I did not want to have her in my bed or get out of my bed and sleep on the floor for her.  \nChristmas was tense and the three of us are arguing all the time.

He told me he'll be extremely disappointed if I'm okay with just letting her suffer and not helping.\"\n\nAsk your dad if he is going to clear your name in future when Sunny tells people that her stepbrother who is 10 years older than her cuddled her every night?  Or she mentions it at school and then CPS etc are informed?  You are 16 years old - you wake up after a wet dream and Sunny's PJ.s are covered in your DNA?!?!?!?!?", "NTA. I think you're doing the right thing.", "NTA \n\nStick to your boundaries you aren\u2019t the kid\u2019s parent. Instead of your dad and stepmom figuring out ways to help this child they want to stick you with the responsibility. Look into moving in with your grandparents if your dad doesn\u2019t start respecting your boundaries. This situation isn\u2019t going to get better unfortunately. They seem set on forcing you to be the big brother you don\u2019t feel you are which will only cause resentment on your part towards them.", "NTA and I would try to avoid staying with Dad as much as possible. Stepmom needs to parent her own child and it\u2019s really concerning she\u2019s not teaching her daughter appropriate boundaries and neglecting her daughter to the point that her daughter is seeking comfort from an older stepbrother/having nightmares. Not to mention, completely disrespecting your boundaries.Her daughter should be comforted by her own mother, not a 16 year old stepbrother. Stepmom and Dad need to parent,not OP.", "NTA.\n\nIt's perfectly valid that you are uncomfortable letting her into your bed. I'd probably feel the same.\n\nAnd even as her brother, this really isn't your responsibility, it is your parents'.\n\nThat Joelle tries to keep you here for that is crazy. She has no right to do that. And 6 year olds can be difficult, but if your parents had also enforced that she should come to them and not you, you probably wouldn't even be having this problem to begin with.\n\nI would sit down with them, or at least your father, if you can and try to make that clear to them. It's pretty crazy that you feel like you have to move out just so you can be left alone at night.", "NTA\n\nAnd if her nightmares are increasing in frequency and intensity, she needs to see a doctor and her mother is an asshole for not recognizing that.\n\nYou are not the parent, your stepmother is.\n\nWhile I find it sad that you don't care for the child, I understand it.", "NTA.  This is not your responsibility. I would consider having a trusted adult talk to them, like your grandparents or a counselor.  This is unfair to you AND to the little one.\n\nSo for where I am coming from... My stepson and youngest (a daughter) have almost your age gap. It is a bit different because I have been in his life since age 2, and she is a half sibling not a step. He loves her a lot.  So basically they are closer than you and your step sister. \n\nIf my daughter wanted him in the night I would tell her no. If he overheard and was like, it's cool I'll comfort her, I would tell him no too.  Why would I not allow it while it would be much easier for me?  Because my husband and I are the parents here. A child's wake ups are the parents responsibility alone.  And kids - even teens - need and deserve rest and sleep.  You have this internet strangers green light to hold firm here.", "NTA. Sunny's mother should take care of Sunny and not try and parentify you. You are entitled to your bed and a good night's sleep. Comforting Joelle's child is not your job.", "If your family suggests you sleep on the floor again, talk to a trusted adult at your school. This is getting out of hand.\n\nNTA", "A compromise is you sleeping on the floor? Fuck off. Joelle is just trying to turn you into a free babysitter so she doesn\u2019t have to be a parent.

Your not the parent and you aren't xomfortable in doing this", "ESH -But a very gentle one for you as I\u2019m not surprised you have problems with Sunny, given what your dad and stepmother are forcing onto you.\n\nI think you keeping your stepsister at arms length is never going to help your relationship, as is othering her the way you do.\n\nHowever, expecting a 16 year old boy to let his six year old sister sleep in his bed with him is really weird and inappropriate, as is your stepmum handing over responsibility for comforting her kid over to you. It sounds like she just doesn\u2019t want to be woken up, TBH.\n\nAlso her interfering in your relationship with your grandparents so that you can essentially provide free childcare is unacceptable.\n\nCould it be that you resent your sister because this has all been put into your shoulders?\n\nShe clearly idolises you, so try to build a relationship with her but also, stick to your boundaries.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Is she scared of your dad?", "I think it would be a good idea to speak to your grandparents about this issue. Your 16 and things won\u2019t change. Unfortunately your dad wants them to be happy even if it makes you uncomfortable. The fact that your stepmom wants to alienate you from your grandparents it\u2019s a red flag and you def need to not only put a stop to it but let your grandparents know about it. \nAlso I hate to be the one to say this but she could lie and say you did things to her daughter if she doesn\u2019t get her way so it\u2019s best to leave that situation and make sure you document the fact that u don\u2019t want nor feel comfortable with her sleeping in your bed.", "NTA. I good compromise (if you want to) is set up a blanket on the floor for her to sleep in if she has nightmares. Or you could build her a \"safe fort\" in her room. So, when she has nightmares, she can go to her safe fort. You can make with blankets and put like a blanket bed on the floor with stuffed animals. She prolly looks up to you.

Not saying you have to or should.", "Nta but....\nI get your opinion.  110% i think its better she not be in your bed bc that could lead to a host if other issues down the road. Her parents should tell her to come to them. \nThat all being said shes young enough to not understand the difference between brother and step brother.  She obviously loves you and feels emotionally that you will protect her.  Thats a good thing even if you \"dont love her\"   \nShes bonded with you and looks at you 100% as her family and finds comfort in that so its not a terrible thing. Find a work around. Let her sleep on a mattress on the floor or make a pillow bed for her so shes in the same room? This will allow her to feel close and protected but still give u distance.\nJust remember this girl is a part of your family wether u like it or not... dont alienate her and destroy her when shes only looking to feel safe.

You're not an adult and the level of authority or power you have is, rightfully, very limited. You didn't ask for this, and while that's true it's ultimately completely irrelevant.

Being asked to watch the kid for a few hours because of an emergency is one thing, but just about anything else something else. You aren't a parent, and Noelle needs to start acting like one for this little girl. She's failing at her job. \n\nThe other thing I wanted to mention is that even if you wanted to help your little stepsister, which would be nice, it's not appropriate for a four year old girl to be in the same bed with a non-family member, especially a teenage young man. Seriously. Not that you'd do anything to her, but it looks sus and schools will take that and run with it. You should probably point that out to your dad and this Noelle woman.

That isn't going to change just because his father happens to be married to her mother, you can do a ceremony and sign some paperwork, but that doesn't equal making a family for all present parties.\n\nI will say, my judgement covers the adults who are encouraging this breech of boundaries.

I'm sorry you had to deal with that.", "Joelle doesn\u2019t care as long as she\u2019s not being disturbed at night!", "That's where my mind went. There's not exactly a way to control that...", ">If that wasn't bad enough, my husband's first response was \"what happened that she won't go to her mom's room at night\" and he has a point.\n\nThis is where I immediately went to. A 6 y/o girl is going to her brother instead of her mother when she's upset? I'm not sure what the right word is, but that just doesn't seem right to me.", "There\u2019s obviously a reason she won\u2019t go to her parents at night, and the nightmares started only 8 months ago and happened daily. It\u2019s unfortunately a very common sign of abuse. OP needs to talk to an adult other than his mom and stepmom to figure out what\u2019s going on.", "I learned a few years ago that Bakoo is indeed taken from/rooted in Japanese lore, but I don't remember details. I'm pretty sure the name is similar, but I could be wrong about that.", "Having raised *6 different 16 year olds*, I think I'm qualified to say sure, he could. And I'll *bet* he does have complicated thoughts like, \"Gee, this sucks for her, but WTF is this *my* problem?\" and \"Why is my stepmother being such a thick skulled, neglectful bitch?\"  and \"Shit, here I am in the middle of this again. When canI fall back to sleep after worrying, so I'm awake for my physics test tomorrow?\" as he's trying to deal with this for the umpteenth time. \n\nWhen I say he's a KID I mean it's not his responsibility, not his kid, should not be his hardship to be awakened regularly by a frightened child who is not his, and who in the grand scheme of things he has the slenderest of relationships with. And it is hard, because like any feeling human, he worries for her but it's not his problem to solve.", "I giggled on that one.", "Yeah, it's Baku, pronounced basically the same.", "Yeah, I had a total crush on my 17-year-old cousin Jim when I was six.", "NTA and your parents are being suspiciously weird about this whole situation. They need to respect your boundaries.", "Dude. \n\nHoly-Inappropriateness.\n\nTry and move to your grandparent's house. Tell your school counselor about how uncomfortable your dad and stepmom are making you. This is not cool. 16 yr old boy being asked to cuddle with a 6 yr old girl? Wth? \n\nAnd they're telling OP he's being?! No.\n\nDude, tell your dad you aren't the parent. Your dad and Joelle's mom? THEY are being BAD PARENTS. Not you. You're a kid and not responsible for the well-being of someone else's kid.", "You are a good person with reasonable boundaries. Dealing with nightmares is something parents should be doing. You are not the parent and they seem way to comfortable trying to make you fill that role.", "NTA, but this is kinda sad. If you\u2019re not comfortable then that\u2019s the end of it and it should be respected!!!\n\nI don\u2019t quite understand though the harm in occasionally comforting her\u2026but in all fairness that\u2019s just me bc I also don\u2019t think I could ever not console a crying child. She obviously sees you as her big brother. You said she was 4 when you met her so she probably barely remembers you not being in her life. Poor kid. But still odd she seeks you out and not her mom. Do you ever sit her down the following day when she\u2019s calm to ask her why she comes to you or do generally ignore her?\n\nThese are just questions, but I still stand by that you\u2019re NTA and your comfort level should be respected.", "NTA at all. I think it\u2019s horrible that her own mother is pushing her 6 year old daughter off on a 16 year old boy to comfort at night when she has nightmares. Your dad should be ashamed of himself too for putting you in that position. I do feel bad for that little girl. Bless her. I understand where you are coming from though. It\u2019s not your responsibility at all. And you should not be forced into this. It\u2019s actually kind of creepy that they are pushing it.\n\nAnd the grandparents can step in as far as the visits, I believe.  That is EXTREMELY UNCALLED FOR and your step-mother needs to be held accountable for that immediately. \n\nBoth of you need better parents, I\u2019m so sorry.", "NTA\n\nJoelle is such an irresponsible woman to want her 6 year old daughter to sleep in the same bed as a 16 year old boy who has no relation to her. My family wouldn't even allow siblings to sleep in the same bed lol\n\nI'm sorry but better safe than sorry is how y'all should be living. OP seems to be the only person with a sound mind in this household. Move out, kid.", "NTA. Good for you for standing up for yourself. Nobody should put you in a situation in which you are uncomfortable. Comforting the child needs to be done by her parents in this situation, for many reasons. I'm sorry about the loss of your mom, too, that is a lot to handle. Please keep seeing your grandparents no matter what.", "NTA and your dad and Joelle are extremely weird for trying to force this on you. They need to have her sleep with them if they\u2019re really that concerned.", "Nta.", "I\u2019m sorry that your dad and step mom are trying to force you to do something you\u2019re not comfortable with. You are NTA and I hope it gets better soon.", "NTA. It is odd they\u2019re pushing this so hard. You are doing the right thing. It would be inappropriate and you need to protect yourself.", "NTA . Creepy is creepy. Just no", "NTA. You have a right to your own comfort zone. Best of luck with your situation OP.", "Not the asshole.\n\nShe's a little kid and I feel for her but don't let them force you to compromise yourself in any way.", "NTA\n\nI know my comment will be buried in here and hopefully maybe OP will read or not.\n\nBut, I\u2019m questioning why isn\u2019t her parents, especially her mother, not doing anything about her nightmares?? She is constantly having them and looks for any comfort here and for some reason her mother is not giving her that at night. Why is she having constant nightmares? Her mother needs to speak to her or get her therapist? Part of this is beyond Reddit pay grade. \n\nI feel like the little sister would need to see some professional help here and find the best route. Because he said they are getting worse. Not saying it is extremely dangerous and something is seriously wrong. But rather, let\u2019s not get it to the point because only being 6 years old and nothings being done is getting a little worry. I wouldn\u2019t want this to continue on.\n\nHER MOTHER needs to open her eyes and be aware of her child. This can be a little thing, but OP said it\u2019s getting worse so seems like to me it will get increase. THEY need to sit down and talk about the well being of the sister and talk to the mother about what she is doing to her child. SHE IS THE PARENT AND NEEDS TO TAKE CARE OF HER.", "NTA , Sunny is not your responsibility. I would move in with your grandparents. Sunny is having night terrors. I had them. And her mother should be the one to deal with it. They can involve sleep walking. I did that as well, I had to wear jingle bells. I would contact CPS , or your school counselor. The reason her mother doesn\u2019t want to deal is they want alone time and want to use you as a babysitter.", "Don\u2019t know why you\u2019re getting downvoted. Last paragraph is absolutely true.", "What? What? What? She\u2019s a 6 year old little girl. Her MOTHER should be taking care of her. Not a 16 year old boy who is COMPLETELY UNCOMFORTABLE with said child crawling into bed with him in the middle of the night\u2026with good reason. 1\u2026he\u2019s not a parent of the child 2\u2026he\u2019s not a parent of the child 3\u2026he\u2019s not a parent of the child 4\u202616 year old boy that is no relation to a 6 year old girl\u2026and he has stated he is not close to her.  So what????", "No, the mother needs to parent up", "OP needs to move in with the grandparents. He\u2019s uncomfortable and the whole thing is kinda weird\u2026 what family pushes a little girl to sleep with a teenage boy\u2026 it\u2019s too weird. Get outta there OP!", "tbf someone is far more likely to be a victim of SA than be a falsely accused perpetrator. that still doesn't make her running to his bed every night but like as long as he's soft about it. there's no reason you should let people especially children with little understanding of boundaries encroaching on what is meant to be a safe space", "This right here so much! I wanted to say it but didn\u2019t want to open that can of worms. I\u2019m so glad it\u2019s been brought up. WTF is wrong with these parents?", "Well yes. He shouldn't have to but it's an easier solution than trying to make the parents understand and arguing with them.", "I really like the walkie-talkie idea actually. Genius plan I hope OP sees this and considers it even if he doesn't feel comfortable comforting her. If she is being abused it is everyone's duty too try and stop that from happening and talking too her is just about the only way", "THIS!!!!!!!!!!\n\nWhy would she prefer to go to her step-brother bed instead of her mom's? Maybe if the reason of her nightmares is sleeping right next to her mom? \n\nI hope we are wrong on this! But, OP, please, don't ignore the signs."]}
