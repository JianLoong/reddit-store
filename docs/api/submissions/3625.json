I wasn't allowed to have boundaries growing up, and it's been awful. \n\nAlso, does the school have a parent manual? At the back of ours, there was a form for the principal, to be copied to the regional supervisor for that school. When the new VP (supposedly) in charge of discipline decided to ignore me and my concerns about my son being bullied, I showed up with that form and watched while the admin faxed it. Staff at two different schools claimed they'd never seen that form and asserted it didn't exist. I managed to follow their procedures and bring pain to people who wouldn't do their jobs. \n\nContinue to advocate for your child, in writing.", "NTA. Just for reference, in a USA public school that unwanted touching constitutes physical assault. Yes, she has every right to refuse it and the school has an obligation to ensure behavioral compliance. The teacher can be cold all she wants but if it happens again, I'd escalate to the school administration and then to the local regional administration.", "NTA. Address the office next time.

I'm sure the teacher will attempt to do the right thing, but it may not be possible to stop every occurrence.  If this is like a kindergarten class, thd kids move around a lot and teacher's attention has to be on many things.  Administration can't do much for you except to move one of the children.   As the parent eith the concern, it will be your daughter who will be moved (Unless several other parents have made a similar complaint. )", "I'm not seeing where the conflict is here, the teacher agreed to do what you want. NAH\n\nAnd honestly, without knowing how you handled this, any 'attitude' you perceive here might be how you brought it up with the teacher. They can only do so much, and if you were being overbearing about requiring the teacher stop the behaviour, at that point it's more about you than it is about the situation between your daughter and the boy.", "INFO: when you said \"caught an attitude\", did she just say \"okay\" in an annoyed voice and you assumed she disagrees with your choice and got defensive and argumentative, or did she specifically say you were being horrible to this boy? It's very possible the \"attitude\" you heard was some sort of \"one more thing to keep track of in a classroom of thirty children\" and less \"you're being horrible\".", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

This was back in the '80s, and the school wanted to just give the boy a \"talking-to\".

It's been many, many decades since the concept of consent or bodily autonomy was GENUINELY unfamiliar to ANYONE raised in Western society. Those of us in Gen X are now in our 40s and 50s. Anyone who is still teaching in an elementary classroom and is below the age of retirement is nowhere NEAR old enough or of a generation to be confused about this.

I get what you're saying, and in theory it's great. In fact, it's exactly what my own parents taught me, and what many kids I know were taught: \"Be loud. Shout, 'DON'T TOUCH ME!' Embarrass the person who is hugging you when you don't want them to hug you.\"\n\nThe problem is that in practice, she may be shy or embarrassed to draw attention to herself. He may be physically bigger than her and she's scared that being loud or shouty will only make him more aggressive (definitely a possibility, he certainly doesn't care that she doesn't welcome his affections). \n\nShe has also already learned that the adult in the room will not back her up. So now not only can she not count on her teacher for safety, but she may be worried that if she \"stands up for herself\" that she may actually become a target TWICE OVER . . . that the teacher may punish her for being disruptive as well. Which is absolutely a possibility, given how the teacher reacted to OPs request. \n\nDon't put it on kids to protect themselves. Don't tell them that it's their job to stop someone from touching them. Don't tell them how to react to unwanted touch, because in the moment they can't always control their reactions. They may be scared, or panicky, or freeze.

I cannot be next to every student at all times to stop all unwanted touches, just like I can\u2019t stop some of them from getting hurt. It\u2019s PreK.

Most kids who give unwanted hugs *are* just being kids who don't understand how a \"good touch\" like a hug could be bad or don't have a good grasp of boundaries yet. Growing up I had super long hair, and I constantly had other kids touching it without asking because they thought it was pretty. They shouldn't have done it, but they were just being kids--it was totally different from the times I've had creepy adult men try to touch my hair.   \n\n\"They are just kids\" is a bad phrase when people use it as an excuse not to step in and correct these issues--which is, admittedly, how it often is used. But the above comment isn't doing that, so I don't see why acknowledging that they are just kids is something you disagree with in this context.", "How could that not be true? \u201cKids are just kids\u201d is basically a tautology.", "I dunno, just whatever is normal at the school? Most classrooms have a system where you lose privileges for a while, or have to miss recess, or something along those lines. I'm sure they can think of something age appropriate.", "To me it still sounds bad. It makes it sound like kids aren't really important. Like I said, I agree with everything that u said, except for that and that's ok", "Definitely NTA. Children not being taught about boundaries is how we end up with \"boys will be boys\" situations. \n\n\nI hope you find a solution to this in a calm and thoughtful manner because personally I would have gaslit that teacher to hell and back from throwing out all sorts of \"-phile\" accusations at her after her dismissive response to your concerns.", "This is ENTIRELY unacceptable. Every child (person really) has the right to body autonomy. Report this to an administrator. I understand some kids are just affectionate but they have to learn to respect others.", "I'm 30 now and when I went to school we had the \"15cm rule\" and I think it's a great blanket rule across the board to prevent unwanted touch as a kid. It prevented potentially uncomfortable conversations and for children to keep their hands to themselves.\n\nNTA", "NTA. Teacher is just huffy because you pointed something out that any preschooler should already know: no means no, and we do not touch without permission. \n\nPlus now the teacher has to actually watch the kids and can\u2019t just ignore them. Such a chore. \n\n(Like to ad that I used to work as a teacher and while most were good and did their work, there are some\u2026yeah you get me)", "NTA", "NTA - This kid needs to learn boundaries. If the teacher won't do it, then please escalate it to the principal. This is never okay.", "NTA but I will say, the most common thing I say to elementary students is \u201ckeep your hands to yourself.\u201d It\u2019s on constant repeat. Now that doesn\u2019t excuse their behavior, but it is exhausting to have to repeat the same thing to the same kid over and over. Any decent teacher probably had conversations with the students about consent and touching, which is why she might have been a little cold- she could be trying already! But like others have said DOCUMENT EVERYTHING. If it continues to be a problem after that conversation, include admin.", "NTA, the kid doesn\u2019t wanna be hugged and that\u2019s a reasonable thing to accommodate. \nFirst line in and I\u2019m already low key triggered. I had that problem in school and I DON\u2019T like being touched unless its in response to me touching the person. To be completely honest, my limited impulse control was the only thing keeping me from biting the other kids for doing it, so props to that kid for being more rational than I would\u2019ve been.", "Truth is, your daughter and the boy in her class aren\u2019t being helped by teachers attitude. Your values are right and NTA. Maybe see if you can connect with the boys parents so they can help teach their son that he needs to get consent before giving hugs", "NTA\n\nTeaching children they have ownership over their own body's is something that should have happened many generations ago. \n\nNo more being forced to endure hugging and kissing relatives you barely know (I can guarantee I've seen my paternal grandparents less than 25 times in my 42 yrs)\n\nNo aunts, uncles, random elderly people, and peers/partners touching your body in ANY way that is unwanted.\n\nBody autonomy is crucial.", "NTA. Please let the school administration know about this, as well. Your child is probably not the only one making complaints, and you're probably not the only one the teacher has blown off. Kindergarten takes a very special kind of personality, and this teacher sounds like she's the wrong fit.", "NTA, good for you for teaching your daughter that boundaries with her body come first.", "NTA. She\u2019ll get over it and if she doesn\u2019t oh well. Your daughter\u2019s well-being is more important.", "It is the kids body and if she doesn't want to be huged she shouldn't. I personaly need my own space and if I don't trust someone I am uncomftrable with them tuching me. So no you are just protecting you kid.", "NTA - the teacher should be more concerned about the fact your daughter is uncomfortable with it. What is wrong with people??", "I was thinking the exact same thing. Its just a hug right? Surely teacher won't mind.", "So, punishments? Teachers should absolutely be well educated in this area and have more resources to be able to act proactively, but they don't. It's rarely prioritised politically. So, you might think that we punish children for bad behaviour, but we're actually punishing them for not being able to act proactively, we're punishing them because we defunded the schools, we punish children because we are bad at raising them. \n \nChildren needs to learn consequences, sure, but they should not be punished.", "NTA. Betcha this is a \u201cboys will be boys\u201d teacher.", "I do hope little boy learns boundaries. I really don't want to read a title in 10 years that says, For being mean to a clamate(M) because he likes hugs OR he won't take a No whenever asking me out?", "NTA - You never know whether this hugging at aged 6 could lead to other behavior as they get older. i think its great that you're teaching your daughter that she can have boundaries and not have anyone touch her without consent", "NTA. You are doing well in teaching your childern that they have a right to boundaries, and it's a shame that this teacher doesn't seem to understand that.", "You are doing this wrong.

And from that perspective: thank you!\n\nMy son (now 7) used to hug everyone wanted or unwanted in kindergarten. We\u2019ve had a lot of difficulties explaining to him that he can only hug / touch when the other child is ok with it. And must stop when someone asks him to. It might be all cute now, but when he grows older it won\u2019t be cute anymore and be labelled harassment. And when does that change? So I totally agree with you. In fact, you\u2019re helping both kids by teaching them it\u2019s not ok to touch someone unless both people are ok with it.", "NTA. I started school in 2009 and even then we were all told to keep our hands to ourselves.", "Info: Is it possible that the other child has special needs which you don't know about and which the teacher obviously can't share with you?

That's how this education should go.", "NTA. Top-notch parenting there, OP! Consent is an important lesson that needs to be taught from the very start", "I saw an insta video of two sisters literally forcing their newborn babies (both under 6 months so they can\u2019t even sit up on their own) to hold each other.  And they were like LOOK THEY\u2019RE HUGGING! cousin besties!!! I know it\u2019s harmless right now but I feel like that\u2019s weird shit and if the moms keep this shit up it will end up with these kids having a bad relationship with physical touch/consent in one way or another.

Are kids not allowed to hug kindergarten teachers? \ud83d\ude2c", "The daughter needs to know now that she has the right to refuse contact from others, and that\u2019s what she should be learning from her teacher.

My daughter had a similar experience.\n\nThis boy would hug her from behind, push her, and sometimes hit. It was pretty bad. She's bigger than most of the kids, though, so I told her that when someone is doing that to her and she doesn't like it, to push him as hard as she can, and run to tell a teacher. \n\nIt worked, kind of. There were obviously follow-up lessons on *when* it's okay to push (she was pushing her girlfriends during play and tag), but he mostly  stopped the violence. \n\nBut the hugging continued. After my daughter started pushing, the teachers started actually getting involved, but he would wait until their backs were turned or on the playground playsets or something. It was really awful. I've never wanted to wring a toddler's neck before. Not a feeling I expected to have. It only ended when he got sent to a special school for kids with behavior problems. Fortunately his parents were wealthy *and* actually cared about his behavior. \n\nI honestly have no idea what I would have had to do if he didn't just leave. I was actually looking for another school before he left.", "She said no and he should listen to that. One of the first things I learned in pre-school was to keep my hands to myself.

Consent needs to be taught early & often.", "NTA go above the teacher and speak to the head teacher about implementing a school wide programme of education on consent.", "Absolutely NTA! Your daughter should know that she does not need to let anyone touch her or feel guilted into letting anyone touch her. And shame on her teacher wtf. \n\nThat boy needs to learn boundaries before it gets him in trouble, but none of that is your daughter\u2019s responsibilities nor does she have to put up with his crap.", "Nta. Way to go mom. I love you teaching her this. Its so so important to know.", "NTA. This teacher needs to teach kids unwanted touching and consent. Kids don\u2019t have to be affectionate just because some people think it\u2019s cute. My parents forced me to be affectionate with relatives when I was a kid and I hated it. I\u2019m on my 30\u2019s now and would never expect a kid to give me hugs or kisses if they have said no !", "Even if the other child has special needs doesn't mean they can keep touching someone else. Especially when it is unwanted.", "That\u2019s horrible. Friends can\u2019t hug each other? What a sad live.", "Yuck!  Hugs are for friends too.  You can teach consent without losing that", "Agree! My kid was super rambunctious and always tackling, hugging and otherwise contact-playing with people. He was the first baby in a long time and family generally thought this was adorable and so while we did teach consent, school was a way more effective place to learn those skills. \n\nHis preschool teachers were kind and firm about reminding him to check that other kids were up for that kind of play. They helped him by giving him lots of ways of asking, lots of options for handling \u201cno,\u201d and lots of reminders to be conscious of where his body was in relation to everyone else\u2019s (eg was he stepping on their mat, bumping into them in line etc) so that he\u2019d be conscious of personal space.\n\nThey did a great job. It might have been rough if the pandemic had made him miss those key years of gentle, consistent socializing and skill building. By first grade he was very mature and respectful. \n\nAnyway NTA. I feel bad for your daughter but the kid in real trouble is the little boy who isn\u2019t getting the social skills teaching he needs.", "Yes, because if she really cared then she would break it up when she sees it instead of allowing each incident to continue. \n\n The girl wouldn't be saying \"the teacher doesn't stop him\" she would be saying \"the teacher tries to stop him but he doesn't listen\"", "Wait, not to be naive, how come no teachers or administrators did anything about this, were they not aware of the situation?", "Returning to in class instruction after so long, the teachers had their hands full. They were around and trying to be responsive. Let's say that kids who had known issues in kindergarten returned to school and had bigger issues. Of course, no one knew how big a deal the changes would be. Some parents are less proactive or hide the issues their kids are having.", "They sound like sucky teachers, I hope they all get sued and fired for not seeing and or preventing this from happening.

A young boy in my family / friend group also had to learn you couldn't hug everyone whenever he wanted when he was that age. It was a bit sad because he also meant well, but it's similar to taching kids not to squeeze animals or be rough with smaller kids, even out of affection. NOT teaching him would've been a disservice to him, as well the other kid who felt uncomfortable.", "NTA she's learning how to stand up for herself.  Take this to the principal", "Nta. I too also hate hugging (most people). I find it uncomfortable. I also don\u2019t like family kissing my face I\u2019ll only allow on the head. It\u2019s been like that since I was little. When I was 19 While visiting my grandma I was introduced to one of her good friends and she tried to hug me and kiss my cheek without asking and I backed up and I said no thanks. She got embarrassed and felt bad and in my opinion she should have. Just because it\u2019s normal for some people to like hugs or kisses doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s normal for everyone.
