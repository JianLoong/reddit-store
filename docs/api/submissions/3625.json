Have her practice it at home so that the next time she encounters hugs from this boy, she'll know how to instinctively react.", "NTA", "NTA, but the school likely won't/can't do anything.

Unwanted contact is not something to minimize.

It shouldn't be made a big deal to avoid negative emotions being attached to it, but it shouldn't be brushed off that your daughter does not like this", "NTA. I wasn't allowed to have boundaries growing up, and it's been awful. \n\nAlso, does the school have a parent manual? At the back of ours, there was a form for the principal, to be copied to the regional supervisor for that school. When the new VP (supposedly) in charge of discipline decided to ignore me and my concerns about my son being bullied, I showed up with that form and watched while the admin faxed it. Staff at two different schools claimed they'd never seen that form and asserted it didn't exist. I managed to follow their procedures and bring pain to people who wouldn't do their jobs. \n\nContinue to advocate for your child, in writing.", "NTA. Just for reference, in a USA public school that unwanted touching constitutes physical assault. Yes, she has every right to refuse it and the school has an obligation to ensure behavioral compliance. The teacher can be cold all she wants but if it happens again, I'd escalate to the school administration and then to the local regional administration.", "NTA. Address the office next time.

Incase teacher turns the cold on your kid.", "The teacher \"caught an atitude\"  he was \"cold about it\".  Sounds like who may be reading things into this situation that don't exist.  I'm sure the teacher will attempt to do the right thing, but it may not be possible to stop every occurrence.  If this is like a kindergarten class, thd kids move around a lot and teacher's attention has to be on many things.  Administration can't do much for you except to move one of the children.   As the parent eith the concern, it will be your daughter who will be moved (Unless several other parents have made a similar complaint. )", "I'm not seeing where the conflict is here, the teacher agreed to do what you want. NAH\n\nAnd honestly, without knowing how you handled this, any 'attitude' you perceive here might be how you brought it up with the teacher. They can only do so much, and if you were being overbearing about requiring the teacher stop the behaviour, at that point it's more about you than it is about the situation between your daughter and the boy.", "INFO: when you said \"caught an attitude\", did she just say \"okay\" in an annoyed voice and you assumed she disagrees with your choice and got defensive and argumentative, or did she specifically say you were being horrible to this boy? It's very possible the \"attitude\" you heard was some sort of \"one more thing to keep track of in a classroom of thirty children\" and less \"you're being horrible\".", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

This was back in the '80s, and the school wanted to just give the boy a \"talking-to\".

It's been many, many decades since the concept of consent or bodily autonomy was GENUINELY unfamiliar to ANYONE raised in Western society. Those of us in Gen X are now in our 40s and 50s. Anyone who is still teaching in an elementary classroom and is below the age of retirement is nowhere NEAR old enough or of a generation to be confused about this.

Teaching her that if she\u2019s not yelling and screaming it is still some form of soft consent is the wrong lesson.  \u201cNO\u201d is enough. \n\nShould this 6 year old get self defense training? With adults saying that \u201cno\u201d isn\u2019t clear enough maybe. Cause clearly some adults out here don\u2019t get that \u201cno\u201d is a complete sentence either.", "The problem with \"teach your daughter to stand up for yourself\" is that it puts the onus on the person being assaulted (and yes, this is a form of assault) to \"keep herself from being assaulted\". I get what you're saying, and in theory it's great. In fact, it's exactly what my own parents taught me, and what many kids I know were taught: \"Be loud. Shout, 'DON'T TOUCH ME!' Embarrass the person who is hugging you when you don't want them to hug you.\"\n\nThe problem is that in practice, she may be shy or embarrassed to draw attention to herself. He may be physically bigger than her and she's scared that being loud or shouty will only make him more aggressive (definitely a possibility, he certainly doesn't care that she doesn't welcome his affections). \n\nShe has also already learned that the adult in the room will not back her up. So now not only can she not count on her teacher for safety, but she may be worried that if she \"stands up for herself\" that she may actually become a target TWICE OVER . . . that the teacher may punish her for being disruptive as well. Which is absolutely a possibility, given how the teacher reacted to OPs request. \n\nDon't put it on kids to protect themselves. Don't tell them that it's their job to stop someone from touching them. Don't tell them how to react to unwanted touch, because in the moment they can't always control their reactions. They may be scared, or panicky, or freeze. All you do by telling your child to \"stand up for themselves\" is make them feel responsible if they don't.", "The cold fact is thus: the teachers cannot be everywhere at once, and unwanted hugs will continue to happen.

I can totally see an AH teacher that's been unresponsive to the situation trying to go down that road.

I\u2019ve made our family enforce and abide by this as well. It applies to any physical touch - especially hugs. If you force children to accept unwanted touching, you teach them to distrust themselves and what their body tells them. The teacher needs to stop being a quack, she\u2019s conditioning your daughter to sacrifice her own feelings for others when the little boy needs to be taught boundaries. Imagine if they were 24 years old - would the teacher think it was rude of your daughter to be upset? No, she would probably think the boy was overstepping boundaries, because he is.", "NTA \n\nEscalate to the principal. This is not okay.", "NTA", "NTA at all. Teaching boundaries about hugging is very important, especially at that age. I'm surprised a teacher is bothered by the thought of enforcing consent, that's something we're directly told to do in my school district.", "Absolutely NTA and I'm so happy you're raising your child to know they have body autonomy! I'm raising my children the same way and it can be so frustrating when others don't believe children have rights over their bodies!", "NTA but I wouldn\u2019t go to the administration unless it happens again.

OP can't go take over as the other kid's mom for a few months and teach him not to be a dick.  OP can't go be the substitute teacher and be on constant watch to make sure this other kid doesn't hug her daughter.  OP can't hover over her daughter and keep the bullies away.\n\nWhat she can do is tell her daughter that if someone isn't listening when she says \"no\" to being touched, that she can _do_ something about it.\n\n>she may actually become a target TWICE OVER . . . that the teacher may punish her for being disruptive as well. Which is absolutely a possibility, given how the teacher reacted to OPs request. \n\nThat can be addressed. You can tell her that no matter what the teachers say, that _you_ say it's okay to protect herself. And that if she gets in trouble with the school that you will handle it, and that she won't be in trouble with _you_.\n\n>Don't put it on kids to protect themselves. Don't tell them that it's their job to stop someone from touching them. Don't tell them how to react to unwanted touch, because in the moment they can't always control their reactions. \n\nSo then if the teacher doesn't fix the situation, what does the daughter do?

The teacher _should_ have sorted this out already.  Can't count on that, obviously.\n\n>It\u2019s not like the teacher needs to be stalking this boy to keep him in line. She can 1) have a lesson in class reaffirming that unwanted touch is no allowed 2) talk to the boy privately 3) if the behavior doesn\u2019t change talk to the boy\u2019s parents 4) impose consequences.

That being said I told all of her teachers to correct her behavior and let me know when she was crossing boundaries starting in preschool because, yeahhhhh I did not want to be that mom with that child. Took years lol but I was diligent and never made a big fuss, just corrected with a discussion on boundaries and other peoples feelings. She is now 20 has her own set of healthy boundaries with people and is still my affectionate baby peaches. So any parent that discussed with me that she was pushing boundaries I took seriously and made sure to work on her behavior and thanked them. I am still friends with all of them lol.", "NTA and that teachers might need to brush up on the rights of the individual.\n\nIn a similar vein, my son had problems in primary school with a kid who \"couldn't be controlled\" and would frequently physically assault other kids.

Suddenly the bully could be controlled and there were no further incidents.....", "I don't understand why,  in this day and age, that boys harassing girls is still acceptable.  How old is this teacher?  It's not cute and has never been cute. \n\nThis shit happened me in 8th grade, I warned my harasser,  he refused to stop,  and I clocked his ass.

They were taught that not everyone else is, and you have to respect that. \n\nThe teacher should absolutely be reinforcing that message, and they should be re-directing to appropriate interactions.", "NTA\nBy doing this, not only are you helping your daughter, but maybe getting rid of a kids weird and questionable habits.  It\u2019s helping both of them, no reason not to", "NTA\n\nMy niece had a similar situation... her parents taught her body autonomy. One of the lass kids was constantly picking her up/hugging... then one day, her dad gets called to the office because niece put up a fight. He was a little proud", "I teach PreK and in my class, bodily autonomy is talked about and encouraged, especially when it comes to touching others, be it it hitting, hugging, fist bumps, high fives, kissing, etc. \n\nHowever, in a class my size, or any really, it is virtually impossible to stop every kid from touching someone else even if it\u2019s unwanted. All I can do is separate children, talk to them and redirect them. I cannot be next to every student at all times to stop all unwanted touches, just like I can\u2019t stop some of them from getting hurt. It\u2019s PreK. This is the age where they are still learning about boundaries and how to respect them and others.\n\nIm assuming it\u2019s not that different for your child\u2019s teacher and classroom. Although your request is valid and reasonable because you don\u2019t want your child\u2019s boundaries to be crossed, the boy in question may have issues recognizing and respecting the boundaries set by others. Even if the teacher is vigilant, she cannot stop all unwanted hugs. Even if the teacher has a million conversations with this kid and tries to correct him each time, it may be a while yet before it finally clicks for him. \n\nI will give her the benefit of the doubt and assume that she may not have been giving you attitude because she didn\u2019t like the fact that you don\u2019t want your child to be involuntary hugged by this kid, but because the teacher probably thought \u201cI have X amount of kids in my class, how the fuck do you expect me to do this?\u201d \nI say this because some parents at my school expect me to give their kid infinite individualized attention as if they are my only student and forget I have a class of 20 or don\u2019t realize how much of my attention I can give each child during the school day. \n\nNTA though. But make sure that you bring this problem/ behavior to the director/ administration because odds are, this kid is doing the exact same thing to other kids in the class. most likely, leadership is already aware and have gotten complaints from other parents. It just takes more complaints and a pissed off parent for it to be taken seriously and changed.", "NTA. You're raising a daughter to respect her body and autonomy and make sure everyone around her does too. Maybe a conversation with the parents of the boy is in order? Obviously, his intentions are good, and he's probably just very affectionate, but I think he should be taught the same lessons you're teaching your daughter. Also, that teacher just sounds terrible.", "NTA.", "NTA I knew a kid who was an absolute snuggle bunny which some of her classmates did not like. Her teachers managed to explain in an age appropriate way that the problem was not the cuddling, it was cuddling people who did not want to be cuddled and to pretend she has an invisible hula hoop around herself until she knows it's OK. \n\nTeaching the young boy early will be helpful for him later on. I've interacted with too many adult men who think *not* being OK with them hugging me means I am doing something wrong and my lack of hugging is a personal attack on them. It's completely out of proportion and very upsetting for them even though they would not want hugs from men they don't know who are insistent. Their lack of education on basic manners and doubling down can cause social isolation.\n\n I've also come across too many lovely people who feel they need to introduce with disclaimers that they don't hug to fend off.\n\nThe little boy here can learn it's OK if people don't want to be hugged and the teacher needs to learn that little girls distress and sadness is just as valid. Her being upset every day is significantly worse than the little boy learning a basic social skill.", "Not that you should actually do this, but I'm envisioning you grabbing the teacher in a big bear hug - or, better yet, having your husband do it - and then tell her you're just being affectionate.", "NTA !!", "Fucking hell, kid\u2019s already being sexually harassed at age 6.

It's saved my ass so many times when people try to pretend we didn't have conversations that we did. Send the follow-up email too, every time there's an in-person convo.
