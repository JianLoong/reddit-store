{"id": 10451, "submission_id": "1179ugx", "title": "AITA for saying my wife doesn't get final say on our finances?", "selftext": "My wife and I have mixed finances. We have joint accounts and joint credit cards. The only things we have that aren't in both our names are our retirement accounts, but when we retire and start withdrawing from those, they'll just go in our joint account anyway. She makes about 90k a year from her job salary, and I work freelance so some years make a lot more than that and some years make a lot less.\n\nWe have six kids, including the son I came into the marriage with. He is 21 and the rest are still at home. He will graduate from university this year. He wants to go to graduate school in the fall. There is not enough left in his college fund to cover the entire cost of graduate school. Realistically the remainder of his fund would only cover about 30% of the total cost, perhaps less.\n\nI talked to my wife and said I wanted to pay for the program. She didn't like the idea. She asked if we would be able to pay for graduate school for all six kids. I said realistically all six won't go to graduate school. That's statistically unlikely. She said it's possible though, and I admitted it is possible. She said it's a bad precedent to set.\n\nAfter a little back and forth she said \"well it's two yes and one no, right? I'm saying no. So we aren't doing it.\" I told her she can't just unilaterally decide I can't pay for something anymore than I can unilaterally tell her not to pay for something. She agreed for things up to a certain cost but said for large purchases that's how it has to be with combined finances. I suggested we uncombine finances then, because that feels controlling.\n\nShe got upset and tabled the discussion. I ran the math on both our take home pay over the years and our annual expenses. Basically I calculated how much we both brought in and subtracted half our expenses from both numbers. I showed her my figures and said if we uncouple our finances that percentage is hers and this is mine, and mine is large enough to pay for graduate school, so it's completely her decision on if we continue to have combined finances or not, but I'm paying for graduate school.\n\nMy wife said I'm a huge asshole for running the numbers and calculating exactly which percentage of our combined life is \"mine\" and which is \"hers\" because marriage is a team effort and can't be divided up like that. I told her I agreed until she tried to tell me what I am and am not allowed to buy. I don't think it's okay for either of us to decide what the other does or doesn't have a right to buy. She thinks I'm an ass, but what's the point of working hard my whole life if I can't even provide for my kids when the moment arises? What am I even working towards then?", "created_utc": 1676906967, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1179ugx/aita_for_saying_my_wife_doesnt_get_final_say_on/", "score": 241, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

My husband is one of 3 children and the youngest. His parents did not budget well, and while his oldest brother had college paid for, and his middle brother had substantial help, my husband got none. I have no idea how he manages not to be super resentful, because I would be. It definitely has impacted his relationship with his family and money negatively, but it wasn\u2019t a relationship-ending thing. He definitely has some residual self-worth issues and tie ups around finances that I think are tied to the fact that he was set back over $100k when his brothers were not. \n\nJust consider that the decision to pay for your son when you can\u2019t for your other children can not only impact their family relationships, but their own self-identity and mental health. \n\nAlso, grad school is an individual choice, imo. When you have a college fund, or help for your parents, I believe that it covers undergrad. If there\u2019s extra money left over, the child should be entitled to use it how they like. If they want to put it toward grad school, that\u2019s great, but they can pay for the rest. Generally the thought behind going to grad school is to get a higher paying job anyways so some debt isn\u2019t the end of the world. \n\nAn alternative idea to float to your wife, and what my parents did with me, was they loaned me the money for school so that I wouldn\u2019t be paying interest to a bank. We had a contract and repayment plan in place, and it was SOOOOO FAVORABLE compared to traditional student loans. I didn\u2019t mind paying my parents back - especially because I also had a college fund and this loan was for educational expenses beyond that fund.  \n\nFinally, the biggest issue here is that you tried to split finances when you were told no by your wife. In a shared finance situation, either of you should have veto power. Especially on something that will greatly financially impact your family for years to come.", "Info: \n\nWill she be expected to pick up the slack for day to day things and bills if you pay for him to go to graduate school? Will this put any more of a financial burden on her and will you explain to your other children if they want to go why you only paid for your son?", "Yta.  When joining finances, it takes two yeses on big expenditures.  Suggesting to unmingle your finances just to get your way is an asshole move.", "YTA. You have six children. It is not feasible to pay for grad school for each of them so why set that precedent with child one? If you paid for the undergrad and there was enough for 30% of the grad degree, your son can figure out how to pay for it. You mention objections to her unilateral veto of the expense but what about your unilateral decision to spend? It sounds like you had a plan for college savings, and that you just need to stick to the original plan.", "YTA. I do see where you\u2019re coming from but you lost me completely with the \u201cwhy do I work hard to provide for my kid if I\u2019m not allowed to provide for them?\u201d BRO. That\u2019s exactly the point she\u2019s making- you\u2019re trying to provide for *one* kid, specifically the kid you \u201cbrought into the marriage\u201d. You then chose to have 5 more children. Is it really just now occurring to you that the more children you produce, the less resources you will be able to provide? YTA for treating \u201cyour\u201d son differently from the kids you share with your wife, YTA for failing to prepare financially for this moment and then trying to shift blame to your wife, and YTA for forcing this conversation on her when you had to know it was a ridiculous stance to take.", "YTA you already admitted this is going to be a special privilege your son will get and not all of the other kids will. What do you think will happen when the next one wants to go to grad school and you tell them you can\u2019t afford it? \n\nThey\u2019ll say you funded their brother so why not? Then they will resent you and their brother and worst case will go low to no contact like so many others in this forum. Favouritism isn\u2019t a good look and that\u2019s what you\u2019re about to do. \n\nYour wife is right, she had a very reasonable argument that you confirmed and now you\u2019re just being a dick.", "If one spouse refuses to bend on financial problems and starts trying to strong arm the other into doing what they want, that spouse is blowing up the marriage by being selfish. \n\nThat\u2019s you, by the way. You\u2019re wife is trying to make things fair for all of the children and you\u2019re throwing a temper tantrum and trying to \u201ccharge her\u201d for taking maternity leave for your kids!\n\nWhat happens when you split financials and you have a sucky year? When you make way less then her? What happens if your other kids resent you or are angry over the fact you clearly favor your eldest child? What happens if she divorces you for being an asshole over money and you end up paying child support? \n\nYou need to rethink whether you want to sacrifice your relationship with your wife and other kids over something your oldest son wants but doesn\u2019t need. \n\nYTA", "YTA. She's not asking for the final say. She's asking for a say. You just don't like what she had to say. As someone else mentioned, its 2 yeses on big financial decisions.\n\nFor what its worth, I agree with your wife's analysis. If you can't afford to treat all six children equitably (graduate school, buying a house, starting a business, IVF - whatever they would do would that money), then you need to revise the gifts to be equitable. Right now, you're not trying to provide for you \\*kids\\* you're trying to swoop in to help one of them in a way that will harm the others. If you want to pay for his graduate school, find a way to make additional money or reduce expenses so that you can provide the same benefit to all your kids.", "INFO: What about your ex, OP? Would they be willing to maybe split the cost of grad school to bring down how much you\u2019d be paying?", "YTA.\n\nFirst of all, it's great that you paid for your kid's undergrad, but graduate school is a whole other thing.  It really depends on the discipline.   Many programs are set up with graduate assistantships so that the student works their way through and don't have to pay.  Others are hugely expensive and don't actually give the student a marketable skill.\n\nAnd some kids choose graduate school because they would rather go to school for free (to them) than go out and find a real job. At some point you have to make sure your child is moving towards being a self-sustaining adult.\n\nFinally, your math here doesn't matter.  You are the one with the unreliable income, so if you separate your finances and pay for grad school, then next year you may find yourself unable to pay your half of the mortgage.  What then?", "Info: you say you are freelance. Can you guarantee a certain amount of money each year? The problem with freelance is some years you have good years and some can be awful. It is hard to predict if your income will take a hit and you need to plan appropriately and have enough in savings to cover. Will you expect your wife to cover you if you don\u2019t make enough money?\n\nI am leaning toward YTA as your wife is looking at the long-term effects. You have 5 other kids to put through college and retirement to plan for. While it\u2019s nice to pay for grad school that is a luxury and not a need. Your retirement is a need and hopefully being able to pay for your other children\u2019s undergraduate should be a higher priority want than one child\u2019s grad school", "Info: with all of your finances separate how is the college and graduate school education for the other five children going to be handled?", "So, what you're saying then, OP, is that YOU should get final say on your joint finances. Big ticket expenditures should be jointly agreed. She does not agree. The fact that you are willing to blow up your entire financial agreement, and from the sound of it, your marriage speaks volumes. If you have no respect for the agreement you both agreed to, or no respect for your wife, what about your FIVE other children? \n\nYour 21-year-old is an adult. Grad school is a choice. Most grad schools have employment for grad students to help off-set the costs. \n\nBut keep insisting that you get to have the final say on your finances, by all means. I'm sure that will end well.", "YTA. Your son has chosen to continue his studies past 4 yrs of college, he should get student loans like most people do. You have 5 minor children to put through college, unknown things can pop up at anytime. It should take two yes for major expenditures.", "YTA. You\u2019re doing a disservice to your other kids. You\u2019re turning a molehill into a mountain. Your son has to deal with life eventually, and a graduate degree is about being able to earn more. A loan for that program, from you BOTH? Okay. Doing the math? Gross. Just so gross. From a guy that does a lot of math with money regularly. \n\nAre you not your wife\u2019s partner in all things? Why chose this to fight over while also not accounting for your other children\u2019s\u2019 education?", "YTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"but what's the point of working hard my whole life if I can't even provide for my kids when the moment arises?\" .. But you HAVEN't worked hard enough to provide grad school for all six kids, have you?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nso YOU are an AH to your other kids. The REASONABLE approach would be to decide how much you can help ALL kids with grad school, and give him that much.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd: You are an AH, relationship wise.", "YTA we told each of our kids they had x amount of money for college (looked at what we could realistically afford and divided by number of children). Anything above that they would take out loans. You can\u2019t do more for one kid than the other, that\u2019s not fair. Best case scenario you can help pay back the loans if it turns out you\u2019re right and the others don\u2019t need as much as you\u2019ve saved.", "YTA. This will potentially ruin the relationship between you, your kids, and your wife. Think, dude.", "YTA combined finances and marriage mean a shared life, so you do have to agree. Otherwise it\u2019s separate finances for your separate lives\n\nShe\u2019s also right to consider what happens to the 5 other kids in their futures. Otherwise they will all think you think more of your first born than the rest of them.\n\nWhy not go away and figure out how much it would cost for a variation of 1-6 kids for casting likely costs for each to attend and then work out how feasible it is based on X kids attending.", "Wow there is a lot to unpack here. \n\nFirst,  yes. YTA.  You should have had the conversation about grad school ages ago. Ages. Second, you're wanting to change your entire family structure because you aren't getting your way. That's.... wow. \n\nThere's not a lot of good going on here,  and you and your wife may need a professional to help you get it settled", "YTA - why does her no when you want yes seem unfair and controlling but your yes when she wants no is totally fine and she needs to get on board. \nRunning the numbers was childish and asshole behaviour. \u201cThis is my money\u201d makes it seem like you were never combined in your mind anyway. Good thing the years you made a lot less she didn\u2019t suddenly decide you should start splitting expenses", "YTA. You are the one being selfish and controlling. If you guys can\u2019t pay for six graduate degrees, then you aren\u2019t only paying for one. \n\nIt\u2019s also really convenient how you have used combined finances to your advantage this whole time and are only abandoning it to get your way. \n\nYour son is 21 and will have at least 25% of his graduate degree paid for, he can figure out how to pay for the rest of it.", "YTA your wife doesn't get final say on the finances, but neither do you. You both need to sit down and find some way to compromise when spending this much money. And if you can't, then you can't spend it. The suggestion to split finances was a super asshole move on top of that.", "INFO: If you pay for your son's grad school, can you still afford to send all your other children to college? And will you still be able to fund your share of all common household expenses (including monthly expenses, vacations etc.)", "YTA it should be 2 yes, 1 no. Your son does not need to go to graduate school. He can work and pay for it when he can. It is a bad precedent to pay a huge payout for one kid (and NOT hers) and not provide the same for your other kids. You are setting your entire family up for resentment in the future and a lot of issues. Figure a set amount to give each kid that yall can actually afford and let them do with it as they please once they're old enough.", "YTA- she brings up a very valid point, can you realistically do this for the other kids. It\u2019s shortsighted to give the eldest a free ride, when you know the youngest will most likely have to pay for themselves \n\nYour son had his first degree paid for and if he chooses to go to Graduate school than he can look for grants, scholarships, work or student loans.", "Info:  How much money is in the other 5 kids college accounts?", "YTA.  You are favoring your son at the expense of the other six.  He gets a full ride to university and graduate school, and you yourself admit that you won't be able to do the same for all six.  Regardless if they go or not, you are giving your son a gift of $50-100k and the rest get what....  That's favoritism and a bad precedent.", "Our finances are a joint decision until I disagree with that and do what I want. YTA.", "YTA \n\nSolely because you don\u2019t listen to her opinion on the matter, you already made up your controlling mind, marriage is a partnership, not dictatorship", "YTA\n\nIf you realistically cannot save and pay for ALL children to go to graduate school, then you shouldn't do so for one. The 21 y/o can use what's left of his college fund and get scholarships/loans for the remainder.\n\nWith combined finances, she is correct, 2 yeses or one no.

Your just going to say sorry, I paid for eldest-theres nothing left for you?", "YTA. You both need to say yes to make this happen.", "YTA. You guys don\u2019t make enough to put 6 kids through grad school. Your wife is right that if you help one kid you need to be prepared to help all.

Also, that\u2019s a huge expenditure to unilaterally decide on your part.", "My parents could not help all six of their children with post secondary school: they made a bargain with my oldest brother that they would help him but he in turn would help his siblings with school. YTA if you don't reach an understanding with wife and child that is going to be fair to all your children.", "That's not how separate finances work. You don't get to add up all previous years you've made money vs her and then average it out over say 12 years and go this is my money this is yours. My husband and I have separate accounts my paychecks go in my account his paychecks go to his account. We each have allocated bills that we are responsible for paying (mortgage, phone, car insurance, utilities etc). Anything left over after I pay my portion of the bills is mine to spend how I want, same for him. If I suddenly rake a job where I make less I have less spending money, I don't get to then make him responsible for more of the bills. And even though we gave separate finances we STILL have a 2 yes for anything above a certain $ amount. If you are separating finances then your money will vary per your income since you have a job that changes income.", "INFO: \n\n1. Ratio wise, how much of your annual salary and your wife\u2019s combined would your son need for grad school. (Eg grad school is two years, $50k each year, $100k total. He has $30k, needs $70k. You and your wife pull in a total of $175k this year and also next, so he needs 20% of your combined annual household income before taxes to go to grad school). \n\n2. What is the grad school for?

You and your wife set rules when you decided to combine finances. You now want to change the rules to get what you want. You and your wife are raising six children, saving for college, and saving for retirement at once. If your son got through undergrad without student loan debt, it's not unreasonable for him to find other ways to finance grad school once his college fund is exhausted. You're basically counting on being able to provide less educational assistance for the other five later to do what you want for the oldest now.

I know far too many people with debt from graduate degrees that they wish they had never taken on.  \n\nDoes he actually want to do in depth study as a graduate student, or is he delaying entering the real world?  I\u2019ve seen both in young people.  \n\nEither way, if you pay the full freight for graduate study for the oldest, you set up the expectation that you\u2019ll do so for the others.  Are you prepared for that?   \nIf your son is expected to pay part of his way, does he still desire to advance his education now?

We have joint accounts and joint credit cards. The only things we have that aren't in both our names are our retirement accounts, but when we retire and start withdrawing from those, they'll just go in our joint account anyway. She makes about 90k a year from her job salary, and I work freelance so some years make a lot more than that and some years make a lot less.\n\nWe have six kids, including the son I came into the marriage with. He is 21 and the rest are still at home. He will graduate from university this year. He wants to go to graduate school in the fall. There is not enough left in his college fund to cover the entire cost of graduate school. Realistically the remainder of his fund would only cover about 30% of the total cost, perhaps less.\n\nI talked to my wife and said I wanted to pay for the program. She didn't like the idea. She asked if we would be able to pay for graduate school for all six kids. I said realistically all six won't go to graduate school. That's statistically unlikely. She said it's possible though, and I admitted it is possible. She said it's a bad precedent to set.\n\nAfter a little back and forth she said \"well it's two yes and one no, right? I'm saying no. So we aren't doing it.\" I told her she can't just unilaterally decide I can't pay for something anymore than I can unilaterally tell her not to pay for something. She agreed for things up to a certain cost but said for large purchases that's how it has to be with combined finances. I suggested we uncombine finances then, because that feels controlling.\n\nShe got upset and tabled the discussion. I ran the math on both our take home pay over the years and our annual expenses. Basically I calculated how much we both brought in and subtracted half our expenses from both numbers. I showed her my figures and said if we uncouple our finances that percentage is hers and this is mine, and mine is large enough to pay for graduate school, so it's completely her decision on if we continue to have combined finances or not, but I'm paying for graduate school.\n\nMy wife said I'm a huge asshole for running the numbers and calculating exactly which percentage of our combined life is \"mine\" and which is \"hers\" because marriage is a team effort and can't be divided up like that. I told her I agreed until she tried to tell me what I am and am not allowed to buy. I don't think it's okay for either of us to decide what the other does or doesn't have a right to buy. She thinks I'm an ass, but what's the point of working hard my whole life if I can't even provide for my kids when the moment arises? What am I even working towards then?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

If your wife is insecure about whether paying for grad school will leave the younger children with less money or leave you with insufficient memo retirement savings, perhaps you can work out a way to help him but reassure her. Your wife may have anxiety about whether your earnings will remain consistent, her job is secure, etc.   A lot of us are perfectly fine financially but still feeling anxious.  \n\nOne option is to give him a small part of graduate school expenses now and let him take out loans for the rest.  That will allow you to focus on retirement savings and college for the younger children.

A financial manager may have many other options.\n\nI personally can\u2019t image treating any major financial decision like my spouse had no voice.

I took out loans my first year and was a teaching assistant the second year.

You\u2019re setting yourself up for your children to feel like you\u2019re playing favorites.", "So you'll 'figure it out' but you're willing to tank their futures, your relationship with all five of your children, and any hope of a healthy marriage because you want to win the argument?    \n\n\nThere's definitely a controlling person in this relationship but it ain't your wife.     It's you.    Financially irresponsible too.", "I don't see how this all works out. Your oldest child, who I assume will be going to college in a year or two, has $70,000 which if you live in the United States  is not enough money to pay for 4 years of school. You will have no way to subsidize it or to work things out because you also have to pay for another child who's following just a year later.\n\nHonestly, I think that separating your finances just seems silly at this point. You can't have both six children and separate finances. They are your finances. And I don't think that you should pay the other 70% for the graduate School. I do think you should try to help him by cosigning on a loan and that should be your policy for all six of them. You're giving them a set amount for their education and after that you will cosign on a loan, up to an amount that is comfortable for both you and wife.\n\nBest of luck.", "I think that the compromise is that your son needs to have some skin in the game too. If there is enough left in the fund for %30, use that. Son kicks in %30 with loans and you and wife kick in the rest. Quit being a hard ass on this, you both took it too far. Try remembering that you are partners. ESH", "Threatening to end the arrangement you agreed to live under IS disrespecting her and insisting on having your own way.  In the most destructive, tantrum-like way imaginable. \n\nYou came here looking for advice. The overwhelming consensus is YTA and you are wrong. Or did you come on here thinking everyone would agree with you?", "I mean... if there was ever a GIANT box of \"do as I say, not as I do,\" I think we just read it", "So for the first one, OP is stating he\u2019s doing it with or without her support and that he wants to separate their finances to do it. He hasn\u2019t even done the math on the rest of his kids accounts to see how to make it fair. Which is very telling. \n\nThe second one is very easy. He doesn\u2019t have a consistent income, so his equation will work out for him over the long run. Combined finances have worked for both of them, but he\u2019s abandoning it over him not getting his way. His wife isn\u2019t even being weird about it, she\u2019s trying to be fair to all of the kids. \n\nWhen you say there is no rationale logic, I\u2019m just confused by what you mean. Him and his wife are saving for their retirement. They are not getting any younger and will eventually have to stop working. They have 6 kids and the savings they have for their education will not pay for all of them to get graduate degrees. \n\nEvery dollar they make affects their future retirement. He is willing to break their shared finances to fully fund one child\u2019s graduate degree. The likelihood of him being able to finance the rest is unlikely. Which is going to cause problems with the favored kids siblings. \n\nThere are so many other ways to go about this problem but op is being a controlling AH about it and blowing up their combined finances because he isn\u2019t getting his way. He has completely taken away his wife\u2019s ability to have an input on decision making.", "Holy shit yes she gets a say if she joined finances. She probably helped raise this kid since OP has not mentioned the biomom. And it sounds like she already helped fund his college fund, so I think she gets a say since they agreed to join accounts and work together as a unit to pay for their kids. His son is a part of that familial unit as well.\n\nObviously, we don't have a full picture, but from what information is given bio mom isn't a factor, and his wife has already helped pay for 4 years of college.", "And she agreed that a certain amount of resources would go to this child; OP wants to increase the pot after the fact. Especially since his income is volatile, what happens if he takes \u201chis\u201d money out of their finances (that they had previously agreed to combine) and an emergency happens before he\u2019s unable to replenishish the savings? Does the wife now have to use \u201cher\u201d money to cover that in full?", "And if all 5 do post-graduate, will you pay for all 5? Given that postgrad is becoming more and more necessary even for entry level positions?", "70k isn\u2019t much to fully cover 4 years of college expenses", "I read the comments.  My point still stands.  He could end up giving his oldest child a gift or 50-100k for graduate school.  If the others don't attend graduate school they don't get the gift.  Which means they lose out on the 50-100k because they chose not to go, and the oldest son got a leg up because he got the additional money. If he wanted it to be fair he could set aside 50k for each for use of grad school or whatever.  But as he says it's school or nothing.  His right, but he favors his children that goes to school over those that don't.", "Wait until one of them wants to go to med school. There is no way they'd be able to pay for that. It's easy to make promises, not so easy to follow thru especially on things like college. If he has 5 kids all under 18 the price of college will continue to go up. They make decent money but he cannot guarantee that he'll have enough funds to pay for everyone's college and grad school.", "He said they would figure it out. Which likely means he and his wife will have to keep working long after they want to.", "But that totally depends on the degree", "Your wife still ends up paying for it even if the tuition comes from your savings. She\u2019ll have to make up the difference for what you were saving. When you run short, are you then going to propose you commingle savings again? There are more programs to help cover grad school and at his age, he has more years to pay off his school than you do to save for retirement.", "I assume you built those savings together, you made an agreement to combine finances and put money into savings with that agreement in mind. \n\nSo you are going back on the original terms of the agreement you made when putting the money into savings.", "Does his program not offer graduate assistantships with tuition waivers?", "My daughter is going to graduate school and is becoming a graduate RA in order to pay for it since she knows a master\u2019s degree is on her to afford as she\u2019s an adult and this is a choice she\u2019s making. Why can\u2019t your son figure it out? Scholarships? Working on campus?", "Do you realize that most people in the mental health field don\u2019t make a lot of money? Mental health services are seriously underfunded and it makes it hard for professionals in the field to make a living. If you do this you\u2019ll be telling your son that he can continue to depend on you to make things comfortable for him. At this point in his life, he should have a game plan for how he\u2019s going to make it on his own, including how he\u2019s going to get through grad school.", "Does it leave you enough to cover grad school/ college for all of your other children?", "Well, you've made a point of answering 1/4 questions, so YTA. Do more for your kids instead of trying to buy them when they're old enough to get away.", "So I'm confused, was the calculating of money put into the relationship intended to demonstrate you have spent more financially historically or was it meant to calculate a theoretical lump sum that has already been spent, but had it not been spent could now be used on grad school?", "You\u2019ve stated you won\u2019t have money to send them all to grad school. You don\u2019t think if 2-3 don\u2019t go they wouldn\u2019t be disappointed you didn\u2019t offer them the same amount of money to further their life? Wether that be a house down payment, help moving, etc. you haven\u2019t thought anything through, this is super short sited on your end and will breed resentment between siblings.", "[deleted]", "~~And how much has the 21 year old been given\u2026~~\n\n*21 year old was given $65k so far for his undergraduate degree. And has enough in his fund for 30% of his graduate school.*\n\n*Average cost of graduate school is $30-$40k.*\n\nIf you can get all the kids to funds equal to his before they need them, then go for it. If you can\u2019t, fucking don\u2019t. By the time your children are going for graduates, they can get their own jobs and fund it themselves. You\u2019re only going to cause resentment by favoring this child over the other five.", "Thank you. I was wondering if the issue was him rather than the money. I don\u2019t think helping someone with education is a frivolous expenditure. NTA", "I would be inclined to agree with your argument if you gave OP(the father) the benefit of the doubt. \n\nYou have given the wife the benefit of the doubt, in that reasoning for saying no is not with bad intentions. \n\nHowever, no benefit of the doubt for the father\u2019s reasons. \n\nWhat if the kid is getting a grad degree in something that will genuinely help people or be valuable to society? \n\nIf the father is willing to invest a lot of money the. It must be in a degree that is important and useful. Even the wife didn\u2019t say the grad degree was useless.", "Yes but at the same time she clearly thinks it's only her decision and it's hard to compromise with that kind of person.", "I wouldn't be able to I don't think. Not that kids are owed it but man it would hurt knowing parents did for others and not you", "I get it though. Not passing it on to your kids but I can fully understand having a chip where parents are concerned. Like you care enough about my siblings to give them this huge step up in life but not me? That would be a very hard thing to swallow", "I'm saying it works out either way. With or without those years in the formula. And the money I'll be spending comes from savings. So basically if I take the years she wasn't working out of the equation altogether, a larger percentage of the savings are hers. But that would still leave me with enough.", "I didn't use anything against her. What I'm saying is, for fairness, I removed the income I made those years from the math, to make it more even.", "Why doesn't anyone commenting understand the math? It isn't that complicated. I took the money I made when she was on maternity leave out of the formula to make the results more even. How difficult is that to understand?", "I don't think you understand the comment. If I remove the years she was on maternity leave from my calculations, she owns a larger percentage of our savings. Yet, even still, I would have enough money. Basically, what I'm saying is, I won't credit myself any of the money I made those years. To make it fair. The money I made during that time doesn't count, basically. But the math still works.", "Actually, not just grad school. If they give one kid, say $200K to satisfy their need to have a good future and fulfill their desires (college and grad school), they should by in fairness  give each kid the equivalent amount for college, house down payment, IVF, whatever they equally need/desire. It's obvious they cannot afford to do that. He is playing favorites, and it very much looks like it's because the 21-year-old is \"his\" child. (Which makes me wonder, where is the 21-year-old's mother in this picture?)", "Oh. She's moved on.", "I don't understand your question. School helps you get a career. Neither my wife nor I would ever give our kids money for a wedding. We'd give them a wedding present, but we wouldn't pay for the wedding. We have spoken in the past how baffling we think it is when people ask their parents to help pay for their weddings. As for a house, again, we would give a housewarming gift, but we wouldn't help pay for the house.", "That's absolutely enough money if you don't go to an expensive college the whole time. Go to a community, spend 2 years getting your basic credits for ~$5k, then transfer to a state school and finish up there. I live in MA, it would be less than $30k to get a 4-year degree like that for me if I didn't live on campus. It's still absurdly expensive, but if the budget is $70k it's absolutely doable.\n\nMaybe OP lives somewhere more expensive education-wise than MA, and I don't envy him if he does, but a blanket \"70k isn't enough\" statement is just untrue.", "Our oldest's tuition at our state's university was 65k for all four years. What are you basing your assertion that 70k isn't sufficient on? Also you are aware that the fund with 70k in it will be a lot more in three years when he starts college, yes?", "I think we could make it work. But it's unlikely they will all attend post graduate.", "Business \ud83d\ude0a", "I didn't understand the rest of your questions, but I didn't want to be rude.

He won\u2019t want to ensure all the children have the same advantage and when the younger children call him out on his favouritism he will call them selfish and ungrateful", "Of course it\u2019s the money. They had a plan to pay for college for all 6 children equally and he wants to go against that when they can\u2019t guarantee equal treatment for the other 5", "Whether it's useful or not, if he only pays for this one and not the others it's blatantly unfair. Post grad degrees are becoming more and more mandatory, even for entry level positions. \n\nUnless he can spend the same money on all kids, it's simply not fair and the kids will see it and react accordingly.", "Oh yeah I totally agree. That's why it's so admirable that this person's husband has forgiven it.", "Are you prepared that this could end your marriage if you make a unilateral decision ?\n\nAlso you have to be prepared that your other children will want to go on to post grad schooling and you'll be on the hook to pay because fair is fair.", "I get where you are coming from but did you really think this through? If you want to separate the savings that will open pandora\u2019s box. Possible points of discussion will be if your eldest son is adopted by your wife meaning if she is financially responsible for him. Then if there was ever a purchase one of you thought was unnecessary. Do you need equipment for your freelance job? She might ask to deduct that from your savings as it didn\u2019t benefit her.

And also think about how you want to finance the other children\u2019s education", "I have tried rereading your math, but it\u2019s still not making sense to me how you calculated her maternity years.

MATH. ISN\u2019T. THE. ISSUE. The issue, is you\u2019re setting a precedent of paying for education you KNOW you can not support for all of your children.

BUT, assuming that will cause one or some of them to receive less support when it\u2019s THEIR turn to go to higher education.\n\nYou doubling down and splitting up the finances as a Mine vs. Yours thing when you both had a system that supported your family is also a really bad precedent start with your wife.
