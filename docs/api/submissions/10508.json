There is 2 kids part time (from previous marriage) and 2 kids living with. One of those kids is 13moM and my son is 8mo now. My SO (22f) is a SAHM and does all the house work that's our share (she wanted and likes to do that work but I still do some here and there if she gets overwhelmed or to remind her she doesn't need to all the time) \n\nSo for some reason SIL has had it out for SO and has been giving her a hard time. She would get on her ass for not cleaning a dish immediately after using it or a pot not being washed (it was washed 3 times and it still wasn't good enough) she stopped inviting SO to the family dinners with all my brothers and their families. She would invite SO to *leftovers* instead of dinner every night. \n\nWe ended up working through this but things picked up again recently with SIL taking stabs at SO about the kids. SIL claims on various things that SO is \"copying\" her on everything. For example SO got a weighted straw cup for our son because she saw her son have one. She said the same basic thing about toys and clothes and food choices. Which was ridiculous because most of those things SO purchased before our son was even born. \n\nAnyway so a couple days ago SIL got a new car seat for her son and it was delivered. She set it up in the living room and then installed it in the car. We already had the same car seat in our car because our son already maxed out the old one (he is the size of a 1 year old) well as SO was leaving to take our son to the park for a walk, SIL saw our car seat and I guess she lost it. \n\nShe berated SO for copying and she was sick of it and that she needed to get her own parenting style instead of taking hers. That she shares enough with SO like the house and she doesn't want to share parenting styles too. I heard the commotion since I was working on my car and came over and said \"hold up, everything isn't always about you. 'SO' bought all this stuff before you did and Im the one that put it in the car last week. You're not the only one with a kid in the world and you don't own rights to all these things anyway.\" \n\nWhich she left crying because I did yell. I was fed up with the bs and I admit I didn't have to yell like I did. Anyway a few hours later my brother texts me and says I was being an asshole and that SIL sacrifices a lot for us and demands I apologize and take back my accusations against her. \n\nSo AITA?", "created_utc": 1676925775, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/117jxwp/aita_34m_for_yelling_at_sil_28f_and_making_her_cry/", "score": 137, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
