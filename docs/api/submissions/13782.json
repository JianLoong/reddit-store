You thought that what grandma was doing was ok. \n\nMy sympathies to your sister- she has lost a spouse, and is in the process of losing a sibling as well.", "I was on the fence at first, but honestly YTA. This was a party for your grandparents anniversary, but then became something to honour people in your family who had passed on. \n\nYour grandmother excluded your BIL, not because he wasn't family, but because \"she is young\"? Whatever the hell that means. \n\nYou did suggest it, but you didn't stand up for her and instead pandered to your grandmother for the sake of keeping the peace.\n\nIt would have been a nice gesture to include your sister, who is still in mourning as her husband only passed a few months ago, but for whatever reason your grandmother doubled down on not including him.", "YTA.  You and your grandmother are horrible people.\n\nI hope your sister finds true family someday.", "YTA. Your grandma is huge ah. You and your grandma have very little respect for your sister", "YTA.   \nYou should have talked to sister before excluding her. That means you and grandma are both AHs now. If you\u2019d talked to her it\u2019d be just grandma wearing the AH cap.   \n\n\nOne\u2019s grief can never be more or less than another in this situation\u2026 all parties have had significant loss. Your grandmother had a lifetime and chidlren and grandchildren with her husband. Your sister had hopes of all the same and got to have (I presume) none of that. How do you even begin to compare? You don\u2019t. Loss is infinite and undefinable and people shouldn\u2019t be ruled the winners in this losers game.", "YTA. If you \"really wanted her to be included\", you should have fought for her. It's not a big deal to include a few extra slides in the presentation, it is a decent thing to do. Instead, you all ended up excluding a grieving widow - your own sister. I imagine it's incredibly painful for her, she is grieving and now she knows that her own family is not there for her. I hope you find a way to make amends, because what you did really sucks.", "Ahhh you already know it.  YTA. Op, your sister needs you and gosh, your grandmother is awful.", "YTA to some extent for not trying harder to get grandma to recognize your sister\u2019s grief as well. Yes she\u2019s young, but IMO that makes it even harder because you\u2019re not only dealing with the death of someone you love, but the loss of the life and family you were planning to have together. That said, there\u2019s only so much you can do, and your sister expecting you to not be there for grandma isn\u2019t right either. Honestly, ESH a little bit.", "ESH (not the sister)\n\nA line in the sand was drawn, everyone picked a side. Your sister was left alone on her side, the person with the most recent loss.", "ESH except your sister. Your Grandma's idea for a party was weird enough, but to exclude your sister was just terrible.", "ESH except your sister. They all got married for the same reason, they all expected to live out their lives with their spouses. It's not a contest. Loss is loss, grief is grief. Tell your family not to judge.", "Wow. This is\u2026really bad. Do you not care about your sister at all? I don\u2019t even know if she is a real person and I feel horrible for her that her family is apparently a bunch of cruel, uncaring people. I can\u2019t imagine treating a friend or relative this way, let alone my sister. And you just let it happen, like it was nothing. YTA", "There is a difference between becoming a widow after almost 60 years of marriage and becoming one after two years - for instance, the chances or your grandma getting into a new relationship are much smaller than your sister's are, while your grandpa's death was much more likely than your BIL's, so the shock for your sister was much bigger - but the pain, the loss and the mourning are real and devastating for both of them..\n\nTour grandma is insensitive for thinking that your sister's loss is not as serious and shattering as hers is,. And you should have discussed matters with your sister before you decided what would be the best course of action in a matter that regarded her.\n\nSo yes, YTA.", "Your grandma and you are giant assholes. Love has no time parameters. My parents were married for twenty years fucking HATED each other, my grandparents were married for 22 and my grandfather would bring her flowers from his garden every day", "YTA your sister wasn\u2019t less married because her marriage was short and it\u2019s probably sadder for your sister BECAUSE she is young and was only married for 2 years. Who expects to be a widow at 29? You should be supporting her in her grief, not excluding her, and you should have told grandma she should be ashamed for belittling your sisters grief and marriage.", "YTA. Wow. What a supportive family. Y'all can celebrate being assholes together.", "YTA. It is a shame you don't like your sister.", "YTA and so is your grandma. So if your sister had a child that passed at a year old, would she not count as a mother? Would her grief not be as important as a mother who lost her 14 year old? Would it not count because she is still young?  \n\nYour sisters husband has been dead less than 6 months, and you say she is still grieving. Of course, that's something most people don't recover from, let alone when it is so fresh. Your grandma excludes her from the lost love ones slideshow, and when she realises she might get upset, she just uninvites her? Then you just go along with it? At a time your sister needed you, you have shown her how little you care and how she can not depend on you. You should have pushed your AH grandma. If she still wouldn't agree, then you should have stood by your sister. Your sister has the freshest pain but was left out because she only got 2 years with her husband! She's punished for having less time with her loved one instead of the 57 years, children and grandchildren that your grandparents got together. Talk about rubbing salt into the wounds.. \"You unfairly got only 2 years with your husband, didn't have a family or decades of love, so your marriage and loss don't count. If he'd have died in 10 years, then maybe we would have considered it. It is really on him for not dying further down the line. Sorry, I guess!\"\nWhat shitty family members you are!", "YTA your grandmothers husband died which already is soul shattering but you also lost and uncle and a cousin around that time - a son and a grandchild to her. That tells me she is trying to cope with what happened. After she passes if you continue this tradition you can add to it. Respect someone's way of coping with loss.", "Geez, I feel so bad for your sister. **YTA**", "INFO Why are you planning a 60th wedding anniversary if the marriage didn't make it to 60 years? If your sister's marriage of two years doesn't count, grandma doesn't get to celebrate 60 years after only being married for 57", "Tough one - YTA for not standing up for your sister to attend\n\nNTA for honoring your grandmother's wishes about the event.", "ESH- it sounds like you did stand up for her (by suggesting it to your grandma) but your grandma still refused. Could you have done more? Yes. Could you have done less? Also yes. You tried, you just didn\u2019t succeed. Give yourself a little credit. Also, it\u2019s not all on you to make your grandma change her mind. Where are the other people in your family on this? \n\nI get your sister is hurt, and she should be because this situation is crappy. But you\u2019re likely an easier target than your grandma too, so she may be taking it out on you. That\u2019s not cool either. \n\nTbh- your grandma is TA, but it\u2019s hard to be in your shoes (respectful and make someone change a hard-held belief you disagree with). \n\nAre you going to the party or are you skipping in solidarity with your sister?", "Your grandmother negated your widowed sisters feelings.  Your sister is grieving.\n\nI can't say why a death X yrs ago is more important that a more recent death.  pPople are jerks and can.t empathize.\n\nI think you should be more supportive  of your sis her right now.  \n\nyou are NTA But you may have to choose between family members,", "NTA\n\nIt was grandma's party, celebrating what would have been a long marriage.\n\nYou suggested sis be included and gma declined.\n\nIt wasn't your party or battle to fight on behalf of your sister.  Gma decided to just exclude her from the party to keep the drama down.\n\nYour sister put you in a bad position, but I feel you made the right decision in supporting gma in her celebration.\n\nHugs and Good Luck", "NTA imo...because you never intend to hurt her feelings... BUT!\n\nyou really should standing for her, no matter what because it's what family do\n\nso maybe a lil bit AH after all\n\nyour sister is right to be mad at you and f... right to be mad at your granma\n\nhope you all get better soon btw", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
