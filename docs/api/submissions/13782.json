Both were married and my grandma decided to pay respect to their relationships as well, by including them in a slideshow and having their spouses sit with her. I thought this was a great idea, but I suggested that she include my sister too, as her husband died in November. My grandma refused though, saying it wasn't the same because my sister is young (29) and had only been married for two years. \n\nI definitely felt this would hurt my sister's feelings, so after some discussion, my grandma decided to just exclude her from the party. I wasn't 100% sure this was the right course of action, but my sister is still grieving, and I figured there was a chance she would skip the event, so I agreed.\n\nMy sister found out and she's very upset. She thinks our grandma is an asshole for excluding her and thinking she's not a real widow. But she's madder at me for not standing up for her. She thinks I should've quit and told grandma to throw the party on her own, or even went ahead and made a slideshow for her without telling grandma.

If you \"really wanted her to be included\", you should have fought for her. It's not a big deal to include a few extra slides in the presentation, it is a decent thing to do.

Your grandma excludes her from the lost love ones slideshow, and when she realises she might get upset, she just uninvites her? Then you just go along with it? At a time your sister needed you, you have shown her how little you care and how she can not depend on you. You should have pushed your AH grandma. If she still wouldn't agree, then you should have stood by your sister. Your sister has the freshest pain but was left out because she only got 2 years with her husband!

Talk about rubbing salt into the wounds.. \"You unfairly got only 2 years with your husband, didn't have a family or decades of love, so your marriage and loss don't count.

Sorry, I guess!\"\nWhat shitty family members you are!", "YTA your grandmothers husband died which already is soul shattering but you also lost and uncle and a cousin around that time - a son and a grandchild to her.
