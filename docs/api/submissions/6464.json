She didn't go about it well, but she certainly got her dig in \ud83d\ude0f", "Also about having a workplace that is not hostile due to your body!", "Well, I personally wouldn't call her a good person based on this scenario...commenting unsolicited on someone's body in a negative way is extremely rude and unkind. How dare she!", "guaranteed Janet is misrable at home also", "\u201cSeverely inappropriate\u201d is a bit harsh. A positive working environment is one where colleagues can form friendships and joke, they don\u2019t need to be robots all the time. Janet interfered in a conversation that didn\u2019t involve her then insulted OP\u2019s appearance. That is the only line crossing that occurred.", "NTA.  It's very inappropriate to make comments about another persons body at work - especially unsolicited comments.\n\nJokes are ok at work - just remember others can hear you so just make sure you don't cross any lines.  Otherwise, have a good time.", "NTA \n\n\u201cWhy do you pay such attention to my *figure*, Janet? That\u2019s a little inappropriate, don\u2019t you think?\u201d", "Janet's comment was an HR violation. It can absolutely be serial harassment and a hostile workplace even if both parties are female. Reporting her to HR will help keep that out of the office so everyone can be happier. \n\nNTA.", "Her two cents? Please, more like a Blockbuster gift card. Utterly worthless. You do you. NTA.", "NTA. Nothing wrong with joking around at work as long as you\u2019re not being actually mean to anyone or getting in the way of your/anyone else\u2019s work. Unsolicited comments on someone else\u2019s body are DEFINITELY inappropriate tho.", "NTA In high school I always wore sweaters and one day a classmate told me that I shouldn't wear them because it made me look \"like a girl\", he said it as if he cared about me when it didn't affect anyone, he told him I said fuck you dude.", "NTA\n\nHonestly would report that to HR. She should not be discussing your body like that. You start first before she does.", "NTA", "NTA.  If you have HR, I would report her for stating your figure is unflattering and unfeminene.  That\u2019s not something she should be saying in the workplace to anyone.", "NTA.  You're fine, but your coworker could get fired for harassing you and making inappropriate comments about your body.", "NTA it was completely work inappropriate to comment on your body at all. Sounds like she has a crush on Jack and wanted to get a dig in.", "You\u2019re NTA at all for having an inside joke with your coworker. Someone at your workplace tried to body shame you, and I really commend you for your completely unbothered response. I\u2019d bring her two pennies and tell her the last thing you will ever need is her two cents.", "Maybe Janet envies the friendship between you and Jack. Was she sitting alone bur nearby? Would she have wanted to be included but never is?  Are her social skills poor and her aspect unfriendly do people don\u2019t think to include her.  \n\nSo she criticizes you to neutralize how your image, personality, femininity and easy bantering relationship suggest what she is lacking.", "NTA - You do have to realize that you and your co-worker joking around in the way that you do will upset some folks AND as the woman, you will be blamed because boys will be boys. It's BS but real. However, your co-worker took sexism one step farther when she started commenting on your figure. What she did is condescending and rude. Possibly she is jealous because you are young and have a friendly relationship with your male co-workers.", "NTA, you body is your choice, the jokes were not offensive...a private convo is exactly that.  Your co-worker is not trying to help...you are there to do a job, not look more feminine.", "Janet sounds a little jealous - probably of the lite banter between you and other other coworker.  You were conversing with him at lunch; she was sitting alone.", "oh man, you're reminding me of the ask a manager letter where someone got a job where it was against the rules to tell jokes. not inappropriate jokes, any joke. I'd speedrun getting fired sooooooooo fast.", "How they are inappropriate?\n\nNTA", "I love hurting the feelings of older women (just any woman older than myself, in my 20s) who voices unwarranted judgment at my lack of \u201cfemininity\u201d.

It\u2019s coming from internalized misogyny because it\u2019s threatening to their own sense of self-identity as \u201cappropriately feminine\u201d women.", "You should not be threatening to kill people in the office, even as a joke. That's extremely inappropriate.", "Where do you think these personal attacks come from? \n\nI'm a guy and the first thing I think of, is deep personal insecurity and a futile attempt to squelch cognitive dissonance between the bloated beached whale carcass they see in the mirror, and the negative emotion caused by seeing a real-life person who makes different personal choices (diet/exercise) and thus receives different outcomes.", "\u201cStiff about your body\u201d would have such drastically different implications if Janet were a man lol", "My dream is to be \"appropriately feminine\" like Venus and Serena.", "..."]}
