The members of Devo are technically boomers and they would never. We know this. We know that individuals transcend generational norms. \n\nIt\u2019s great that you\u2019re a feminist and that your experience was sex, drugs, and rock and roll, but *that\u2019s not what we\u2019re talking about here*. We\u2019re talking about people who behave like OP\u2019s co-worker, whose behavior embodies an older mainstream ideology.", "That\u2019s great, but this isn\u2019t about you as an individual. And it\u2019s also not saying EVERYONE follows this trend. Gender norms are absolutely relaxing over time and are being pushed more and more with each coming generation. That doesn\u2019t take anything away from the very amazing work done by previous generations who had different circumstances and barriers to break down for the next ones.", "I hear you - it\u2019s not completely linear, but there is still a trend when you look over time. And as I said - every generation pushes boundaries compared to the ones before them. That\u2019s why I didn\u2019t put a specific age group out there. We all stand on the shoulders of those before us! \n\nIn this context, we are focusing on gender norms and it\u2019s undeniable that the break down of gender norms is more prevalent now than ever, and typically mostly by gen z, millennials, and some gen x. Hardly by boomers who were raised with those standards in a more strict society and often express being overwhelmed by the changes of todays youth.", "[removed]", "Well you know what 2c is worth eh?\n\nNTA", "I guess she doesn\u2019t understand sexual harrassment laws.

In this case, you were joking with a coworker about nothing controversial.\n\nYou could turn the tables on this coworker and tell her her unwanted personal comments are creating a hostile working environment for you.
