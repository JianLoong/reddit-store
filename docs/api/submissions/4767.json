That way if he is able to drag your brother there, they already know who to look for and deal with it accordingly. This is a 'just in case he succeeds in tricking your brother into going' and the pool knows what is up to counter that.\n\nAs for your mom, I think you need to spell it out for her. She's being a terrible parent as well. I honestly think you need to pose that question to her. If that is dad's 'trying his best' what is hers? Like, if dad's trying his best is to become abusive, belittling his son, what is mom's? Out of sight, out of mind? Schedule appointments when she feels like it? I'd honestly say to her 'Dad is trying his best and his best is destroying your son. Will you still say the same when he's in the hospital because of dad 'trying his best'? Should I apologize then?'\n\nTake care of your brother and keep an eye on him. Let him know you're there for him and understand. Help him find resources he needs if need be."]}
