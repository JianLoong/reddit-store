It wasn\u2019t a silly little accident. It\u2019s something that quite literally changed him. But my dad keeps downplaying it. It\u2019s so aggravating. \n\nAnyways, our dad came home from work early yesterday and immediately went up to my brother and said \u201cget your shit, we\u2019re going to the pool.\u201d My brother went fuck no but my dad kept insisting saying he knew just the trick. Again, my brother said no and locked himself in his room. \n\nMy dad then looked at me and said \u201cShit happens, he just needs to get over it already. Help me drag him out.\u201d \n\nI said no. I wasn\u2019t going to help him force my brother do something he\u2019s VERY uncomfortable with. My dad got a bit huffy and was like just do it.

I guess I might\u2019ve rolled my eyes but he got really upset and told me to go my room. I then heard him call me disrespectful and rude.

It makes for a nice quote, \"i may have made some mistakes, but I did my best...\" But it is also bull shit.

Your poor brother had suffered a traumatic incident, and it usually takes a lot of time and professional help in the form of therapy to learn ways to cope and begin moving forward in life again.  Your dad is handling it all the wrong way!  It's not something he can just \"get over\" or \"pull himself together\" on, either!  Your father is lacking compassion and understanding of your brother's suffering and will only do more harm if he attempts to force him into doing something he's not ready for!\n\nI suffered a severe trauma back in the 90's, and it still haunts me, at times!  I am much better than I was, but that is after years of therapy and desensitising myself to things that triggered my flashbacks and pain.  Your parents owe your brother an apology and a promise to help him get the support and counseling he needs to deal with his fears.

Good Luck to both you and your brother.", "Yeah I get that...It just seems like such a huge difference in perspectives that I was curious.", "I suppose I could talk to the guidance counsellor but my brother graduated in June so idk if he\u2019d even be able to do anything.

He needs to seek therapy to help him before the trauma compounds any further. Good on you for standing up for him!", "NTA but your parents are. Your father for trying to force something on your adult brother that has left him traumatized. Your mother for saying that your father is doing his best and that you need to apologize for telling the truth. Your brother needs therapy and your parents are failing him.", "NTA\n\nHe's trying his best? Where? When?
