She should not have offered up your shared cherished items, especially not for free. Even if she thought you'd be fine with it, the car belongs to your partner as well and should be involved in loaning it out. She's trampling both of your boundaries. She wanted to look like a hero with someone else's resources and threw a tantrum when she didn't get to feel special. She is absolutely disrespectful and your family deserves the whole story. Unless you intentionally left out parts of the conversations on the screenshots you're NTA. Everyone here saying otherwise obviously doesn't have that level of a toxic family member.

It\u2019s okay to cut people out of your life, even if you\u2019re related to them.
