Rather than start something, you did the gracious thing and found someplace comfortable for you to eat.  You weren't sulking or pouting at least according to your telling of the story and you even ate quickly so you could rejoin the party.\n\nIf your father-in-law is embarrassed it's because he brought it on himself.  Your wife's response was completely out of line.  If it's a recurring problem, might be worth addressing.  But if you don't see them that often or her inability to tell him know doesn't generally cause problems, it's probably not worth fighting about it.", "INFO: why can't you eat in the other chair but you can have a beer in it?", "NTA but your wife and FIL are the AH\u2019s.", "Your wife has daddy issues that she needs to work on if she\u2019s going to be a grown up in a grown up marriage.", "And his wife is just a big an AH. I mean, did she want her husband to sit somewhere else where that chair couldn't hold his weight, the chair breaks and he's either injured, embarrassed or both? \n\nI'm glad everyone else saw that Dad was being an AH, including OPs kids and MIL. The wife must be really be terrified of standing up to her Dad. They're both ridiculous.", "[removed]", "Exactly. Wife is AH too.", "Maybe he should've sat on FIL", "I'm curious about this too, what's the resolution in her mind?", "[removed]", "Oops. Thank you", "He is 6.8ft the weight aint the problem dummas", "I think his wife is only upset because even her kids have no problem telling Grandpa he was wrong, but she still can't.", "NTA your wife needs to have your back.", "NTA but your wife and FIL are.", "Yeah \u2018you made my dad get shouted at by my mom!\u2019, how? Dad got himself shouted at by mom, I absolutely hate how so many people act like it\u2019s the person speaking out who got the AH in trouble when it\u2019s actually the AH reaping the consequences of their actions.", "Fil isn't that height. Father in law is 6ft. Just over 180 cm. Op is 6.8 making him over 200 cm", "It says 182 ? Did it previously say 282 ? Lol", "That's how I deal with my cat, I tell her I'm going to sit there, and then I proceed to start sitting down. She's learned what those words mean and usually gets down before I turn around. Lets see if the FIL can beat my cat when it comes to figuring it out.", "Probably anything that absolves her of wrong doing", "Comment stolen from u/Riutfragus7597", "My husband is 6\u20198\u201d and only slightly lighter than OP states they are and our dining room chairs are solid steel mid century vintage because he has sat through every cheap piece of furniture we\u2019ve owned. \nNTA OP i bet she\u2019d have been annoyed if you\u2019d have conceded and sat down to eat in a chair that can\u2019t hold your weight and broke it.", "FIL is an Oompa Loompa compared to OP, what an ass.", "Works on kids too! Lol", "You were raised by your father in law? This probably explains your awesome attitude.", "> Except I would have quietly whispered to my father in law, after his rude ass comment, to get the fuck out of my chair before I cleaned his ass up in front of the family.\n\nThen there would be two assholes in the conversation.", "i mean... tbf the FIL did not raise op, he raised op's wife... so trying to say \"exactly how you raised me\" would be really weird.", "Dangerous too. I used to date a 6'4 big boy and he went through a chair and landed on his tail bone, he already had back issues because of his height, and he was hurting for a couple weeks after that. \n\nIf you're at either extreme, big or small, the world is not designed for you. My little mummy was 5' and a bit so i (5'10) was always getting stuff off shelves. She's since passed but if i see a shortie trying to reach for something from the shelf in a shop i always offer to help get it for them.", "I agree, though it\u2019s interesting that nobody else had a problem standing up to her father when it was called for. So capitulation to her father doesn\u2019t seem to have been something she saw modeled by her mother, even if as a child she was taught to give in and take or redirect the blame away from him.", "As a 5'0 nothing woman, i appreciate you. It drives me nuts how high stuff is sometimes and the audacity to tell me i cant climb to reach it when theres noone around to help \ud83e\udd23", "Its not like you can carry a step stool whereever you go....although that would be pretty cool, carry it like a furled umbrella and *bing* little ladder!"]}
