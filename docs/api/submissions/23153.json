You, OTOH, are a far statistical outlier. I\u2019m involved with a group where extra height and extra mass can lead to more easy success, and as a result it tends to draw in bigger, stronger, and honestly heavier, participants, but I don\u2019t think I know anyone, of the hundreds and hundreds of people in that group I know somewhat well, as big as you; the biggest was 6\u2019 6\u201d and at one point weighed about 425# (until his doctor scared him into some aggressive weight loss, and he\u2019s kept it off for decades). You are literally twice the size of FIL - at least in weight - and a full head taller, it\u2019s like comparing FIL to a petite woman. \n\n\nNo, FIL sat in that chair not because he was \u201ca big guy who needed a big chair\u201d, but because he felt \u201cI\u2019m the big man who deserves the big throne\u201d. It was a pure display of dominance, to show you who\u2019s really the boss *in your home*. The fact that you asked him politely to move, and he actively refused, when he could clearly see the size difference, makes that obvious; add in that it was clearly oversized compared to the others, custom-built with your initials on it, means he *knew* it was your chair, and made a (metaphorical) stand. Heck, he may have done it *because* he\u2019s used to being the big guy who everyone listens to, your size intimidates him, and so he felt that was the only way to regain his former social stature. \n\nYou chose the diplomatic route, good on you. \n\n\nYour wife is the AH for not being able to stand up to FIL at all, even something as ovbvious as \u201cOP needs to sit in that chair, he really can\u2019t fit in any of the others\u201d. Everyone else, including FIL, knew he was in the wrong, once you were gone long enough and why, and good on MIL for yelling at FIL for performing such an infantile d*ck-measuring context when your that person\u2019s guest in that home. Her saying you behaved poorly is ridiculous, since, as you said, there was no other reasonable place for you to eat, and FIL was being an obstinate d*ick on the point. The fact that she tells anyone who sits in it, *besides* FIL to please move because it\u2019s the chair you need to sit in shows she knows that you need to have your chair. I\u2019m sure she\u2019s used to being \u201cdaddy\u2019s girl\u201d, where daddy can do no wrong, but in this instance you did nothing to actively cause the rebukes he got, and he brought it completely on himself.", "NTA you asked him to move, he said no. you didn't make a fuss you just went somewhere else and no one but your wife was worried. \n\nthe only person at fault here is your wife who put daddy ahead of you and your FIL who seemed too clueless to care.", "NTA, but  your wife sure is.  Somehow she's tried to make you the villain rather than deal with her father's obnoxious behavior.  Like i get that she was probably anxious, but wow she sounds a bit off her rocker in this instance", "NTA \n\nYou didn\u2019t make it a big deal. You asked, he declined so you left to eat elsewhere.

You were really cool about it all; if your wife has problems standing up to her father, she should go counselling and try and solve them, but calling you the AH is not a good way to do that. Your FIL behaved like an AH and embarrassed himself.", "NTA\n\nBut you could have eaten in the kitchen.", "Majorly NTA\n\nThat chair for your is an accessibility accommodation, what your FIL did was essentially the same as refusing to let a person in a wheelchair use the accessible stall in a public washroom.
