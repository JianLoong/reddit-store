You, OTOH, are a far statistical outlier. I\u2019m involved with a group where extra height and extra mass can lead to more easy success, and as a result it tends to draw in bigger, stronger, and honestly heavier, participants, but I don\u2019t think I know anyone, of the hundreds and hundreds of people in that group I know somewhat well, as big as you; the biggest was 6\u2019 6\u201d and at one point weighed about 425# (until his doctor scared him into some aggressive weight loss, and he\u2019s kept it off for decades). You are literally twice the size of FIL - at least in weight - and a full head taller, it\u2019s like comparing FIL to a petite woman. \n\n\nNo, FIL sat in that chair not because he was \u201ca big guy who needed a big chair\u201d, but because he felt \u201cI\u2019m the big man who deserves the big throne\u201d. It was a pure display of dominance, to show you who\u2019s really the boss *in your home*. The fact that you asked him politely to move, and he actively refused, when he could clearly see the size difference, makes that obvious; add in that it was clearly oversized compared to the others, custom-built with your initials on it, means he *knew* it was your chair, and made a (metaphorical) stand. Heck, he may have done it *because* he\u2019s used to being the big guy who everyone listens to, your size intimidates him, and so he felt that was the only way to regain his former social stature. \n\nYou chose the diplomatic route, good on you. \n\n\nYour wife is the AH for not being able to stand up to FIL at all, even something as ovbvious as \u201cOP needs to sit in that chair, he really can\u2019t fit in any of the others\u201d. Everyone else, including FIL, knew he was in the wrong, once you were gone long enough and why, and good on MIL for yelling at FIL for performing such an infantile d*ck-measuring context when your that person\u2019s guest in that home. Her saying you behaved poorly is ridiculous, since, as you said, there was no other reasonable place for you to eat, and FIL was being an obstinate d*ick on the point. The fact that she tells anyone who sits in it, *besides* FIL to please move because it\u2019s the chair you need to sit in shows she knows that you need to have your chair. I\u2019m sure she\u2019s used to being \u201cdaddy\u2019s girl\u201d, where daddy can do no wrong, but in this instance you did nothing to actively cause the rebukes he got, and he brought it completely on himself.", "NTA you asked him to move, he said no. you didn't make a fuss you just went somewhere else and no one but your wife was worried. \n\nthe only person at fault here is your wife who put daddy ahead of you and your FIL who seemed too clueless to care.", "NTA, but  your wife sure is.

You were really cool about it all; if your wife has problems standing up to her father, she should go counselling and try and solve them, but calling you the AH is not a good way to do that. Your FIL behaved like an AH and embarrassed himself.", "NTA\n\nBut you could have eaten in the kitchen.", "Majorly NTA\n\nThat chair for your is an accessibility accommodation, what your FIL did was essentially the same as refusing to let a person in a wheelchair use the accessible stall in a public washroom.

FIL needs a lesson in class.", "\u201cYou\u2019re in my spot\u201d - Sheldon Cooper", "How is he a \"big guy\"?  200lbs and 6ft tall seems about average to me.\n\nNTA\n\nHe could have moved when you asked him.  How weird.  He doesn't need a special chair. He can be comfortable in any normal chair.", "If you're 300 pounds and have to use a special chair, you're too damned big.", "NTA  Your obnoxious AH FIL Decided to run a power-play and show off in front of people. He didn\u2019t need any reminder about the chair he knew what he was doing. What a loser. Also tell him 6 foot is not big at all. Your WIFE is an AH just like her old man.", "NTA he built the chair specifically for you, knowing that it would be the only place you could sit. He deserved to be called out the way he did.", "You are NTA. Weird powertrip for the FIL? Also Weird  how your fil is considered a big dude\u2026 he sounds very average?", "NTA! He should be embarrassed.. how rude", "NTA but I'd be more concerned with the wife problem your have. She's perfectly fine with her dad being rude and embarrassing you at your own house but suddenly there's an issue when he gets his come upins.", "NTA. Really calm about it, it\u2019s everyone else that defended you. Why isn\u2019t she mad at her mom and the kids? You didn\u2019t throw a hissy fit, you came back out, and there was nothing wrong. He embarrassed himself for being entitled, and she\u2019s a daddy\u2019s girl who didn\u2019t stand up to her own father for the sake of her husband\u2019s comfort and dignity. You said you break regular chairs. What, did she want you to humiliate yourself or eat or the floor?", "NTA, and you FIL is not a big guy. My oldest is 6'1 and 198 and is considered kinda slim. Your FIL made a power move in your house, expecting no blow back since his daughter doesn't confront him. Instead, he got confronted/told off by just about everyone else, including the children there.\n\nFIL is a major AH, and your wife is pushing AH territory by defending his behavior. Y'all need to discuss this one deeply, and then help her find her backbone with him. If MIL can ream him, so can daughter. She is an adult. Hell, include MIL in the discussions later, so she can back your wife when it happens.", "NTA. Some in laws are pompous jerks. Everyone in the family seemed to agree with you.", "NTA. Your wife needs to stand up to her dad.", "NTA. Your FIL is the AH. I am the same size as your FIL, and I fit quite well in every chair but those delicate antique chairs. He wanted to be the AH and he got what he had coming to him. Your wife needs to grow a spine and put you first, when necessary. Her father caused himself to be yelled at. Of course, you could have just told him to get out of your chair.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: typo", "What! Wat! Wut! Wtfuu! So everyone lets FIL know he's a butt for not moving. But wife has to double down because ' you embarrassed my daddy!' No honey bunches of dolt your dad embarrassed himself. You can't take over someone personal chair in their own home. Plus, the husband is bigger than the dad! NTA, but your wife is being one. She needs to have several seats. Hopefully, they are her own.", "NTA.\n\nThat's your house but you let him sit in the chair specifically for the biggest member of the house, you, the one paying bills there. Even his grandchildren jumped on him. He ought to be ashamed of himself and so should your wife.", "This is hilarious. You were so innocent! NTA", "NTA", "NTA - 6\u2019 200 is not a big dude. He could have sat in any chair.", ">My wife said that I behaved poorly and caused her father to be yelled at by her mom. And that even my kids told him that he shouldn't be sitting in my chair.\n\nRemind her you are her husband not your child and not to speak to you like that when her father was in the wrong. NTA.", "NTA\n\nHe should have been yelled at. IDK why people get upset when others shame them for poor behaviour.", "Right, my response to her would have been \"Oh, okay. So which chair would you like me to break and hurt myself in? I'd rather it be one inexpensive to replace\" to really drive the point home", "Exactly. How much wrong can you handle to be if young kids also reprimand you. NTA", "Aye, if the sizes and roles were reversed and my father wanted to posture up on my wife like that I'd tell him right where to go.", "Wish I could upvote this more than once", "I don\u2019t know why it needs to be explained? It seems self explanatory and his size should be reason enough for any to think and understand that the chair is a **need** and not a want", "throwing a tantrum is now walking away? who knew!", "\u201cuse your words\u201d what was he supposed to do after asking? beg?", "I'm a 5'10 220lb gym bro and I can sit in a normal seat.  Giving up the custome seat to someone TWICE my size seems perfectly acceptable.", "Yeah, I'm 6' (granted, lighter than OP's FIL, but still)... while I'm definitely more cramped than most people in airplanes, cars, etc, I definitely don't need a custom chair to be able to sit safely and comfortably.", "It's pretty obvious what he should have said but didn't.", "I tell my dog scuuuse meeee and flap my hands in his direction, as long as you're consistent they'll learn anything it's awesome lol", "One of my cats just refuses to move anyway when my husband does this to him and just allows himself to be squished.  He will lay olin my husband's spot on the bed then just allow my husband to lay on top of him. They both loose at this game of chicken since my husband refuses to put all his weight on the cat and the cat doesn't actually want up be squished...", "It sounds like you're using outdated BMI numbers to determine that, there's more to health than just height and weight.  I've been 6' for the last 20 years.  At my fittest I was 205 and there wasn't a person on this planet who could see me and think I was overweight.  I've also been as low as 180 and as high as 225 and at both those points my body looked like it needed more time in the gym and less at the dinner table.", "Especially when you show up wearing his face!  People don't like that for some reason O.o", "I'm 6'4\" and 300lbs. Had to invest in a set of flexsteel couches, before I was going through a new couch every 2-3 years before they'd break.", "It is pretty neat how they can learn stuff like that. Unfortunately mine has learned that the word \"work\" means I'm about to leave, and she gets very aggressive towards me. She knows what follows work is me not being home all night, and she does not like that one bit.", ">if i see a shortie trying to reach for something from the shelf in a shop i always offer to help get it for them.\n\nIt's called Tall Tax in my family \ud83d\ude05", "Same when you are a mix of both.  I'm 6'2\" and thin.  All tall stuff is made for \"big boys\" so i have to choose between too short and \"looks like a carnival tent w/ me as the pole\".  Happy more stores are finally making a 31x34 available in pants!  didn't happen until my 20s though!", "My 5yo is the same way!  Also a huge Bluey fan, so he will randomly yell DUNNY! and gets upset if i don't roll on top of him and yell \"Squish Squash!\"", "Awww mine learned 'you be good' meant me leaving for work and I get the saddest eyes every time it breaks my heart", "Yeah, my husband gets stopped when we're at the store all the time by women asking for help, lol.", "Ah! As a tall woman I gave up wearing trousers, nothing ever hit my ankles but weren't quite short enough to be \"capri\" pants. Skirts and dresses, no one cares where they fall to really... knee, shin, ankle...oh that must be the design lol", "Maybe I should take up the kilt!"]}
