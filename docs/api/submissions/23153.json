I love that thing. It even has my initials carved into it. It is sturdy and ridiculously large. \n\nWhenever we have people over to the house it is very obvious which chair is meant for me. I have an oversized folding chair that is no where near as comfortable but it allows me to at least be social.

But she can't stand up to her dad. \n\nHe decided that since he is a big guy he deserves the big chair. And my wife chose not to remind him that is the only chair that I can sit in without breaking it or hurting myself. \n\nWhen I was done grilling I came over and asked if I could please have my chair so I could join everyone. \n\nHe said he was comfortable and that he wasn't going to move. \n\nRather than start a stupid argument I just served myself my food and went into my office to eat. Because of the work that I do my office is soundproof and locked and is in the basement that locks as well.  I could lose my job and be criminally liable if some of the information I deal with wasn't properly compartmentalized. \n\nOnce everyone figured out that I had just left to find a comfortable place to eat they all started bugging him to move since he was literally in the only spot I could sit and there were plenty of other seats. \n\nMy wife tried to get me to come back but my phone was upstairs and I was enjoying my peace and quiet. \n\nI ate quickly and came out as soon as I was done. But the damage was done. My FIL was embarrassed by everyone except my wife for sitting in my spot. He was very red when he apologized for taking my spot. \n\nI said no problem and sat to socialize with everyone. \n\nMy wife said that I behaved poorly and caused her father to be yelled at by her mom. And that even my kids told him that he shouldn't be sitting in my chair. \n\nI would have eaten in the kitchen upstairs but it was full of food and people. We don't eat in the living room.
