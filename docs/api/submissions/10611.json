About your children though your life when they go to good schools, or have stuff etc etc. \n\nTake a look at the friendships and see if it's all one side or not. Put your foot down and say that you don't want to hear about it again, then see how they react.", "One thing I've learned is that different cultures have different ideas of what is polite to ask. For example, I am from country where discussing how much you pay for rent would be an inappropriate conversation. But when I moved to Berlin, I was surprised to learn that discussing the price of rent is as casual as discussing the weather. No qualms in asking someone you've only just met how much they pay. It was weird at first, but ultimately I understood that it wasn't because they're nosy or curious about my income, it's mostly for research purposes. So that can be where your friend's curiosity stems from. I have been to weddings where the cost of the wedding was openly discussed by the couple, simply for practical reasons, since other friends would be marrying around that time too and were interested in knowing.\n\nThat said, I do believe you have the right to set a boundary and say you don't want to discuss it.
