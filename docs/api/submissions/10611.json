About your children though your life when they go to good schools, or have stuff etc etc. \n\nTake a look at the friendships and see if it's all one side or not. Put your foot down and say that you don't want to hear about it again, then see how they react.", "One thing I've learned is that different cultures have different ideas of what is polite to ask. For example, I am from country where discussing how much you pay for rent would be an inappropriate conversation. But when I moved to Berlin, I was surprised to learn that discussing the price of rent is as casual as discussing the weather. No qualms in asking someone you've only just met how much they pay. It was weird at first, but ultimately I understood that it wasn't because they're nosy or curious about my income, it's mostly for research purposes. So that can be where your friend's curiosity stems from. I have been to weddings where the cost of the wedding was openly discussed by the couple, simply for practical reasons, since other friends would be marrying around that time too and were interested in knowing.\n\nThat said, I do believe you have the right to set a boundary and say you don't want to discuss it.

I'm going to guess that a $900K wedding is either 'blow the budget on a big performer' (Or renting an unusual location) or a multi-day event, Indian-style.", ">you and your husband have some really, really f*cked up priorities if you'd put all that into a party rather than some sort of charitable cause.\n\nOh fuck off with that", "> you and your husband have some really, really f\\*cked up priorities \n\n\nYou sounds like one of OP's friends in this story. It's none of your business. It's their money, they can do whatever they want with their money even if they decided to dump it all in the Pacific Ocean. Again, it's none of your business.", "That money went to wages and products that people who work make. And parties are fun.", "Yeah because rich people aren\u2019t allowed to have fun. I doubt that they don\u2019t put a ton into charities.", "Why? If they have the money why not spend it how they like? You only live once as they say", "How are they rubbing it in their face by not telling them?", "Yep, this is exactly what this is about.", "Just visibly spending money =/= rubbing it in people\u2019s faces.", "I suspect the friends already know and just want to guilt her about it. If you attend a very expensive wedding it is normally obvious because it tents to be at a very different scale to your budget wedding - and i say that as a fairly budget bride myself. \n\nI suspect the friends have researched for their own wedding and realised OP probably spent a fortune. And they are now being nosy assholes about it.", "You are being utterly ridiculous and exhibiting signs of bitterness and jealousy *just* like the \"friends\". When are people like you gonna stop punishing rich people simply because they are? What right do you and these friends have to dictate how big of a wedding the OP or anyone else should have? Is this how you value friendship? Based on how inferior you feel towards your friends? \n\nOP....NTA. It is frankly rude and uncultured for these people to demand the cost of your wedding. It is a private matter and in no way does it reflect on you. So instead of celebrating your day with you, they probably sat there calculating how much everything costs? Trying to reach out to your husband is so over the line, you actually need to verbally discipline them and draw some lines. This is now a bone of contention in your friendship. They resent that you married money, do they also expect you to start paying for lunches and drinks from now on? I almost thought you were all 21yrs old.", "100% sounds like they just want something to gossip and potential bitch about.", "I mean, it's not like the money went into a black void and disappeared forever. That $900k went towards goods and services. I.e. the wages of working-class people.\n\nThat party paid for photographers, caterers, waiters and countless other professionals and ss long as OP paid fair wages for services and fair value for goods. OPs party was overall a good thing, and I don't think all the people who got a paycheck out of OP and her husband would thank anyone who would have talked the couple out of a big wedding.", "Ummm...you're definitely judging. \n\n\nLet people enjoy themselves if they can afford it. I don't think people should be taking out loans for weddings, which people do, but they had the money.\n\n\nHopefully they are also using their money for good.", "Whether someone should ever be able to acquire enough wealth to afford a $900K wedding is one thing, but the super wealthy should not be vilified for actually spending their wealth. That $900K has been distributed to vendors, event planners, makeup artists, chefs, etc. This is vastly preferable to the more common use of extreme wealth, which is to sit in a hedge fund and extract even more money from working class people through surplus value.", "I'm not happy either that someone can spend what would be life-changing amounts of money for 90%+ of the population on a wedding, and if you want to say anyone with this obscene amount of wealth is an asshole I wouldn't stop you, but look at it this way. They've already hoarded these resources. This is nearly a million dollars of the hoard that's put back into the economy. Any time a member of the ultra rich class spends this kind of money, it's a good thing.", "lol it's exorbitant for most people, but there's nothing wrong with it. Certainly NTA for spending their money the way they want.", "How is that any of anyone elses business though? If he can afford it, why shouldn't he?", "Love your name", "NTA", "Found one of the friends", "When someone spends money on an event, it supports many other people: caterers, servers, photographer, etc. As long as OP and spouse were generous and fair with tipping and treated the staff well, it might not be how I would spend my money, even if I could, but that\u2019s not my choice to say. And who knows how many charities etc. OP and spouse support? They could be sharing beyond our wildest dreams.", "You sound jealous. And poor.", "Are dead elephants cheaper?", "If she doesn\u2019t answer, I\u2019d just say look at any celebrity wedding and then scale it back a little (celebrities can spend multi millions). When you\u2019re in that life style, it\u2019s easy enough to spend like that.", "Florals, custom gowns, and tenting can make up a pretty hefty price tag. There's a whole sub for bigbudgetbrides where you can see how people can easily spend $150k on florals alone.\n\nI definitely don't agree this is the best way to spend money, but after planning my own wedding I fully believe someone could get to $900k if they wanted to.", "I read the cost and literally made a noise like I'd slammed my knee into the cast iron radiator.", "Agree. Adding my vote of **NTA**", "Doesn't matter though. They enjoyed their wedding. If they had the wedding in a cave to suit you, you will still come to call them pretentious.\n\nOp, NTA. Thank you for telling this dude though.", "What a weird thing to say.", "NTA just to cancel out your stupid judgement which is full of bitterness and has nothing to do with the post.", "P.S. I see you're getting a lot of humble brag accusations. I wouldn't go as far as to call you an asshole for your post, but we definitely didn't need to know how much you spent on your wedding. You could have just said, \"a lot.\"", "I have sauce", "Me too! It's completely irrelevant to the question but I'm so curious/nosy, as it's beyond my imagination, unless they paid for everyone's flights and accommodation.", "I don\u2019t think they are TA for having a $900k wedding. If they have the money for it and can afford it, nothing is stopping them from doing so in my opinion", "I think that kind of expenditure is more \"douchey\" than \"assholey\", but I can't disagree otherwise.", "I agree with this. You need to actually draw a line. No- I will not be telling you how much it cost. It\u2019s none of your business and you are making me uncomfortable. \n\nIt\u2019s really bad manners for your so called friends to be asking this. \n\nIf you want to be slightly less in your face rude then you could ask them why they want to know so badly that they keep bringing it up? Are they planning on getting married? I\u2019m sure if they are then they should contact the venue directly and get prices themselves. But it\u2019s ok to just flat out tell them to stop talking about this. Or just look at them blankly and pointedly change the subject every time. If they call you out on it, say you were trying to spare them because they are being incredibly rude and offensive and it\u2019s not your job to teach them good manners so you will simply change the subject till they want to talk about something else.\n\nOr just drop them as friends and focus on the ones who actually care about your feelings", "What part specifically sounds obnoxious?  The only detail provided was the cost. You sound jealous.", "Yep. Why do they want to know? How will this knowledge benefit them? Stir up jealous? NTA and not real friends.", ">It sounds like you're on here to brag about the obscene amount of money you had to overspend on a single day\n\nSeriously. People literally can't pay their rent or buy groceries and OP is like \"we spent almost 1M on a party, AITA?\" Yes, OP. YTA whether you tell your friends how much it cost or not", "Thank you!!!  This whole situation is so ESH.", "Shit adds up quickly with wedding planning. If you have a ton of guests and pick a beautiful venue to hold them, then get good catering, and of course a gorgeous dress, and don\u2019t forget a fancy custom cake, and tailored clothes for the wedding party, and really nice floral arrangements, and of course get a band\u2026\n\nIt adds up.", "Exactly, but OP lying to them is not helping. Thats why they want to start asking someone else. I when she calls them out for their behavior, they\u2019ll stop.", "I think, as long as you're not going into major debt, you should spend as much as you want on a wedding. If you're lucky enough, that's a once in a lifetime opportunity. \n\nAll of humanity engages in rituals and celebrations, spending extra on those occasions is par for the course.", "True, I didn\u2019t think about that. Even worse.", "True, but there's definitely a point of diminishing returns, where it's clear this about the pricetag rather than the item.", "Welp, there's the other pov.  Whatever you can afford to spend justifies itself, and conspicuous consumption is not a moral issue.\n\nI just don't happen to share it.", "They are planning their own wedding - I promise you they will have quickly learned roughly how much it costs to put on a spectacle at the level OP did.\n\nSpeaking as someone planning a wedding, you very quickly learn how much stuff costs. I have friends who I knew spent a ton more money than I am (I never asked, they shared, I don't care what they spent obviously), aNd I bet her friends realise they can't pull off what OP did. Maybe they are insecure or jealous. \n\n I think they can easily see sge spent a ton of money, but are being nosy and mean trying to get the exact sum out of her.", "This. Idek how people don't understand this. Extravagant wedding parties=goods and services being purchased from people who are attempting to market services and goods. \n\nMaybe the people who feel upset by this have no local economy to contribute to industry? Or wish to have large events but are put off by the realities of a free market economy where artisans must ask for fair exchange for their precious reagents.", "Thanks haha", "Cannon fodder has come to defend to the Rich! I'm shaking in my boots.", "Anybody who spends close to a million dollars to celebrate themselves is an asshole.", "Also if you really think about it. They probably paid a lot of people for their services that day. A wedding of that magnitude probably had a lot of employees to make sure it ran smoothly.", "Douchey maybe, especially if you\u2019re trying to flaunt it obnoxiously", "> People literally can't pay their rent or buy groceries and you spent $50 on a video game!?\n\n> People literally can't pay their rent or buy groceries and you spent $500 on a game console!?\n\n> People are literally using child labor and you spent $1000 on a phone!?\n\n> People literally can't pay their rent or buy groceries and you spent $3000 on a cat!?\n\nNo ethical consumption and all that. \n\nDoes 100% of your free income go to public rent funds and food banks? If not, which specific dollar is it where it goes from totally justifiable (you) to abhorrent (her)? When I donate to the local food bank they send a little note that says every $2 is X number of meals, so really if you have at least $2, shouldn't you be spending it on food for others?", "You can\u2019t know that without actually seeing the wedding and an itemized bill. For all you know, every dollar was spent on something that everyone would love to have if they could, or would consider very sensible to have if they had the money.", "If they have the money to spend why not spend it on a wedding? Surely pretty much any form of fun or entertainment is technically a waste of money?\n\nBetter for them to spend it and support all those jobs than for it to sit in the bank unspent. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "[deleted]", "Bush called that \"Trickle down economics\".  Doesn't work.", "Yes. Every one who spends a million dollars to celebrate themselves is an asshole.  I think they should spend 900 k on starbucks.", "No, most millionaires and people with high paying jobs still don't come close to spend a million dollars on a single event", "You\u2019ve got the wrong president there. That was Ronald Reagan, not Bush.", "Lmao what?", "He's out of line but he is right. Alot of good a million bucks could do.", "Why are you assuming that the million bucks spent on a party didn't do any good? Like what do you people assume, OP drove to a hole and dumped a million dollars into it and a party sprung up?\n\nNO!\n\nThat money went to wages, for paying for goods and services. \n\nDo you not believe the waiters working that party deserve wages? Do you not believe the photography team working that party deserve to sell their service? Do you not believe the caterer making the food deserves to be in business?\n\nPeople, working class people, made that party happened and hopefully, they were paid handsomely for it. OP is only in the wrong for that party IF she didn't pay fair wages and fair value for goods and services.", "Sometimes i forget other people take reddit as seriously as life of death.\n\nIt's mostly a meme, but if i have to give a serious reply, your logic works well for regular weddings. Luxury ones such as these, i'd say are unnecessary as the money is placed on high end products etc which would need the money less?\n\nPersonally, idc, have an expensive wedding and dont feel bad about it."]}
