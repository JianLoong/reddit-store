We mostly leave each other alone. But for the past few months I have had a huge issue with Amanda stealing my food. At least every other day something gets taken.\r  \n\r  \nAmanda gets very defensive and denies it whenever I ask her. She\u2019ll raise her voice and say things like \u201cNo! I don\u2019t even like chili!\u201d or \u201cI don\u2019t even like lemon chicken, it wasn\u2019t me!\u201d or \u201cOh, right, because I\u2019m big! Is that it?!\u201d\r  \n\r  \nI got two candy apples and wrote on the container to not touch them since one was for my sister. I watched from the hallway as Amanda ate both my apples. I waited a few minutes to ask Amanda if she ate them. Amanda lied straight to my face and told me she never touched them.\r  \n\r  \nThe last straw was when I baked a cake two weeks ago. I told Amanda to not touch it since it was for a potluck, but that it was a small gathering so I could save a piece for her after if she wanted. Amanda told me \u201cNo thank you\u201d but then later dug out a piece with her hands.\r  \n\r  \nYes, with her hands. She couldn\u2019t even cut herself a slice; She dug out a hunk from the center of the cake with her fingers. I had to throw the entire cake away and was extremely pissed off since I worked hard on that cake and Amanda completely trampled over the boundary that I set.\r  \n\r  \nI know that Amanda is allergic to almonds. So I\u2019ve begun adding almond extract to all of my food. I make sure to only use a small drop. That way there\u2019s only a faint flavor that I\u2019ve basically gotten used to by now.\r  \n\r  \nI write **\u201cHAS ALMOND EXTRACT\u201d** on all my food in thick sharpie, and also spoke to Amanda about it. Amanda got angry and said it was messed up to put something she\u2019s allergic to in all my food. I told Amanda it\u2019s only a problem if she eats my food. And if she\u2019s been honest about not eating my food then there shouldn\u2019t be an issue.\r  \n\r  \nThree of me and Amanda\u2019s mutual friends have reached out because of this. Amanda works at a hospital, so, obviously, the shifts are extremley long and stressful. And my friends said that when you\u2019re tired at the end of a long day, having an instant meal at home is just way easier. \r  \n\r  \nThey said I could do whatever I wanted. But said the kind thing would be to make a large dish that both me and Amanda could eat from throughout the week, since I already do this every Sunday for my grandparents.\r  \n\r  \nI know I\u2019m probably an asshole for saying it, but I told my friends that I just don\u2019t care. Amanda can meal prep her own food on her off-days or look into if her hospital cafeteria offers employee discounts. Amanda\u2019s a grown adult and I\u2019m not her mom.\r  \n\r  \nMy friends agreed I had not technical obligation, but it was about decency/kindness and making an effort with the people you live with.

But your friends are telling you it's not kind that you don't just give her your food and provide meals for her because she works hard in a stressful job and deserves a home-cooked meal at the end of a long day. \n\nWhat does Amanda do to be kind to you when you come home at the end of a long day?  \n\nMaybe this would be a reasonable agreement if you were willing to be the apartment chef, and Amanda would pay for all the food and/or do all the cleanup if you cook or take on another comparable chore that benefits you both. \n\nIt also sounds like your roommate may have a food addiction (assuming based on the \"because I'm big\" comment and that she's hiding and lying about eating the food).  But it's still not acceptable for her to take your food, especially when you've asked her not to do it. As a parent of a child with food allergies, normally I would be against deliberately contaminating food. But a) it's yours, b) it's clearly labeled, and c) it seems as though this has been the only solution that works.  Unless you can arrange to keep all your food under lock and key, you only other option may be to change your roommate. \n\nNTA.", "NTA Had she asked nicely in the first place and offered to pay her share, I would have considered splitting some food.

And I\u2019d ask those friends how they\u2019d feel about Amanda digging into food she was told not to touch with her bare hands, and constantly lying about it.

Amanda is a grown-arse lady, she can feed herself", "NTA- I would totally deflect when her flying monkeys come at you, \"do you think Amanda has an eating disorder?\"", "NTA. It might be nice to cook her the occasional meal but niceness needs to be reciprocal if a long-term interaction. Otherwise you are being asked to be a doormat. And Amanda is not being nice. A candy apple isn't a meal at the end of a long day especially two when you know they were made as a gift. Gouging a slice of cake you know someone made for an event is not nice. It is disrespectful.\n\nAsk your friends why you should take an effective paycut or pay higher rent to provide Amanda with food. She is not compensating you. She is stealing. Keep with the almonds and find a better room-mate as this one will likely move on to revenge for not being able to abuse you by wrecking your food.", "NTA.

I lived with 2 roommates and one of them would invite his friends over and they'd smoke pot and then eat everything in the house.

Tell your friends to cook Amanda a nice meal If they are so worried about it. It's easy to tell someone else what to do when you aren't the one in the situation. Amanda is acting very disrespectful. She is a grown adult, not your child. You don't have to do a damn thing for her. Keep putting the almond extract in your food and work on getting a better living situation going. That chick got issues.", "NTA. As an adult she is fully responsible for her own behaviour; lying and stealing have consequences. You are not her mom...", "NTA. Amanda is a thief and.a liar.\n\nFun fact : \"almond\" is \"amande\" in French.", "The thing is, Amanda ruined all your potential goodwill with her lying and destroying food (I mean, scooping out the middle of a cake with her hand?
