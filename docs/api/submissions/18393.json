I waited a few minutes to ask Amanda if she ate them. Amanda lied straight to my face and told me she never touched them.\r  \n\r  \nThe last straw was when I baked a cake two weeks ago. I told Amanda to not touch it since it was for a potluck, but that it was a small gathering so I could save a piece for her after if she wanted. Amanda told me \u201cNo thank you\u201d but then later dug out a piece with her hands.\r  \n\r  \nYes, with her hands. She couldn\u2019t even cut herself a slice; She dug out a hunk from the center of the cake with her fingers. I had to throw the entire cake away and was extremely pissed off since I worked hard on that cake and Amanda completely trampled over the boundary that I set.\r  \n\r  \nI know that Amanda is allergic to almonds. So I\u2019ve begun adding almond extract to all of my food. I make sure to only use a small drop.

Amanda works at a hospital, so, obviously, the shifts are extremley long and stressful.

But said the kind thing would be to make a large dish that both me and Amanda could eat from throughout the week, since I already do this every Sunday for my grandparents.\r  \n\r  \nI know I\u2019m probably an asshole for saying it, but I told my friends that I just don\u2019t care. Amanda can meal prep her own food on her off-days or look into if her hospital cafeteria offers employee discounts. Amanda\u2019s a grown adult and I\u2019m not her mom.\r  \n\r  \nMy friends agreed I had not technical obligation, but it was about decency/kindness and making an effort with the people you live with.

But it's still not acceptable for her to take your food, especially when you've asked her not to do it. As a parent of a child with food allergies, normally I would be against deliberately contaminating food.
