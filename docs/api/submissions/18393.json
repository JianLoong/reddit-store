I waited a few minutes to ask Amanda if she ate them. Amanda lied straight to my face and told me she never touched them.\r  \n\r  \nThe last straw was when I baked a cake two weeks ago. I told Amanda to not touch it since it was for a potluck, but that it was a small gathering so I could save a piece for her after if she wanted. Amanda told me \u201cNo thank you\u201d but then later dug out a piece with her hands.\r  \n\r  \nYes, with her hands. She couldn\u2019t even cut herself a slice; She dug out a hunk from the center of the cake with her fingers. I had to throw the entire cake away and was extremely pissed off since I worked hard on that cake and Amanda completely trampled over the boundary that I set.\r  \n\r  \nI know that Amanda is allergic to almonds. So I\u2019ve begun adding almond extract to all of my food. I make sure to only use a small drop.

Amanda works at a hospital, so, obviously, the shifts are extremley long and stressful.

But said the kind thing would be to make a large dish that both me and Amanda could eat from throughout the week, since I already do this every Sunday for my grandparents.\r  \n\r  \nI know I\u2019m probably an asshole for saying it, but I told my friends that I just don\u2019t care. Amanda can meal prep her own food on her off-days or look into if her hospital cafeteria offers employee discounts. Amanda\u2019s a grown adult and I\u2019m not her mom.\r  \n\r  \nMy friends agreed I had not technical obligation, but it was about decency/kindness and making an effort with the people you live with.

But it's still not acceptable for her to take your food, especially when you've asked her not to do it. As a parent of a child with food allergies, normally I would be against deliberately contaminating food.

I\u2019m sure Amanda wasn\u2019t so hungry that she had to dig into a cake with her bare hands. \n\nAnd, being in health care, this is even worse because she completely knows how unhygienic that is and that the whole cake will be ruined!\n\nAnd, after OP offered her a piece and she pretended she didn\u2019t want any?! \n\nEither a food disorder or a personality disorder. NTA", "Sorry but you\u2019re wrong here. You\u2019re thinking of almond _essence_. Essence doesn\u2019t have to contain the actual product but _extract_ does. I understand it\u2019s an honest mistake but don\u2019t post things like this about allergens - it could send someone to the hospital.", "Stress is just her excuse. I work at the hospital too while finishing up my degree and I'm not stealing food. I go for a walk or workout or eat out of I'm stressed. My friend also doing a full hospital shift, has kids, and working forward her nurse practitioner degree. She's not stealing food either. Granted that everything in our fridge is what we bought ourselves. Oh wait, I did stole my husband's beer, but to be fair he stole my puddings \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23 OP roommate just wants free meal and straight up stealing and lying to get it.", "So she is the only other one living in the house with you and she is saying she didn't eat your food? Who ate it then, a fairy? Perhaps a mouse? This girl is a terrible roommate. And entitled AF if she thinks because she works hard she deserves to eat YOUR FOOD instead of making or buying her own, like you don't work for your food yourself. She's intentionally eating and ruining your food. And she has some nasty resentment towards you or something to dig into the middle of your cake after you asking her not to and her saying no thank you to you saving her a piece. NTA but you can't seriously keep living with this girl.", "OP, you should be careful. If she has some problem with you somehow she can start to tamper with your food other ways. Not just eating eat but doing something dangerous for you. \n\nIt seems she might hate you or have some mental disorder. It might not be safe to eat food that she has access to. Especially if she is a nurse and has an access to drugs and other stuff. \n\nWho knows what this whole food story really about, especially ruining the cake part. It looks like some emotional personal shit.", "Try going to a used appliance store. You might get a fridge there and ask if they\u2019ll help you put a lock on it.  Amanda is rude.  She knows what she\u2019s doing and doesn\u2019t care. If this problem continues tell her when the lease is up, she needs to move out. Have another roommate lined up.", "I have come to the conclusion there are truly malicious and evil people out there and there are people who have empathy that would never do such things. Amanda is the first one.", "It's also not helpful to cry \"mental issues\" every time someone does weird socially unacceptable shit. Jerks do exist, and it's unfair and degrading to equal jerkness with mental issues every time. Even if you're a mental health pro you cannot diagnose Amanda based on this story. There is no valid ground to say \"but poor girl's just ill\".", "This would be the best of all.", "Your Mom does amazing work, my son spent 7 weeks in the NICU and those nurses took such good care of him.\n\nHe starts college in the fall :-)", "\u2018Natural\u2019 has no legal definition, which is why manufacturers use it so much.", "That\u2019s amazing. My mom sometimes \u201cfloats\u201d to the NICU. She\u2019s been a nurse for 35+ years. I was almost in the NICU myself. They are honestly so underrated, overworked and under-appreciated. Meeting someone who appreciates what they do is amazing.", "I have protein allergies as well.", "Buy pure almond extract or bitter almond extract, those (especially the former) are definitely made from almonds", "So, it's made with belly button lint?"]}
