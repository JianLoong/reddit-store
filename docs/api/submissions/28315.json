You are a legend for sticking up for your sis, in my opinion, and it might even do your enabling parents a dose of good to get a lick of that fire. No way are you a b\\*tch. That'd be your emotional blackmailer of a grandma.", "NTA. If any relationship is ruined, it's because of grandma. Grandma has been self-entitled and running roughshod over sister.\n\nSister should not only ban grandma from the delivery room, but also from visits with the baby. Who knows what grandma will feel entitled to do with the baby?\n\nYou did good by stopping grandma, and don't let anybody tell you different.", "NTA\n\nNothing else was getting through to GM. She was bringing unrelenting stress. It's difficult to believe your parents are angry -- is this some type of cultural thing?\n\n And frankly, your parents should have made GM stop beating up on pregnant sis. This is on them for letting GM push the issue to the brink.", "NTA. Your sister is lucky to have you as her champion. If your family's relationship with your grandma is ruined for good, it's entirely because of your grandma's entitlement. I understand how your parents' bizarrely enabling reaction may be confusing to you, but you are entirely in the right. Grandma is not entitled to any violations of your or your sister's boundaries, and if she stays out of your way, what with all her crying, hysterics, and carrying on, maybe it's just as well. Let your parents kiss up to her if they are so concerned. It doesn't sound like you and your sister are missing much. You are going to be an awesome aunt to this baby.", "NTA\n\nEnjoy the quiet while she's gone... it won't last. But sticking up for your sis and protecting her is the right thing to do. Tell your parents it's their job to keep Grandma from harassing your pregnant sister, but since they failed to do so, you stepped up, and you'll keep stepping up as she's stressing your sis out. That's bad for the health of both mother and the baby. \n\nIf Grandma shows up again (which I suspect she will, I'd tell her if she can't zip it over being present at the birth, she sure as hell won't see the baby after its born.

Also 79 is not that old to not understanding what is going on. She seems like she knows and understands of sound mind and body what she's doing. So the whole \"well, she's old\" doesn't fly!", "NTA, it sounds like your parents enabled your grandmother for far too long and unfortunately, you and your sister now have to deal with it. I\u2019m sorry your parents didn\u2019t agree and I don\u2019t know if or how their minds could be changed, but FWIW definitely NTA. \n\nOn top of it, putting your sister in the stressful position of full chest arguing with someone (\u201cangry and heated and started yelling\u201d), while she is pregnant and in a difficult pregnancy to boot, is selfish. Your sister deserves peace right now as she grows a person, and even if grandma had a leg to stand on in this dispute, it wasn\u2019t handled well on her end.", "NTA, you are a hero for stepping in and backing up your family like that.  Grandma is clearly not behaving like someone who would be included in the delivery room anyway.", "NTA - Grandma needed that reality check....and as soon as she starts crying and going into hysterics, she needs it AGAIN, I would immediately yell \"And crying and having hysterics like a 3 year old throwing a temper tantrum is not going to change our mind! Cut it out! You're a grown adult, not a child! If you keep it up, we won't even let you SEE your grandbaby after its born! Is that how you want things to go?\" Don't soften up on her, stand your ground. She's deliberately trying to emotionally manipulate you guys with all the crocodile tears and stirring up trouble. Don't fall for it, don't let her have her way, don't let her win.", "NTA. That just seems kind of intrusive. I absolutely understand being excited, especially as we get older we're excited to see new generations and that's perfectly understandable. But it sounds like your grandma is going overboard and it is a little bit concerning. Is there something going on with her life like did she experience a big loss recently? And maybe she's trying to make up for it with this? If not and she's just genuinely being intrusive and rude I would ask her why she's so insistent on looking at your sister's crotch", "NTA.

Just because she's old, does not entitle her to walk all over anyone. And seriously, when did childbirth become a spectator sport?

Your grandmother needs to dial it back. She doesn't get any special privileges as a grandmother", " TA. In addition to what others have said, stop even discussing stuff like this with her. It gives her the power of drama and increases your stress.  Tell her what the boundary is ( only the dad, and we're not discussing it). When she brings it up, change the subject. If she won't stop, hang up or leave. \n\nI wonder if her great grandmother was present when she was born, and if she had her mother and grandmothers present when she gave birth. Ever since women began to be isolated in hospitals, spectators mostly haven't been around. When i was born in the 50s even fathers were rarely in the room.  Was she in the room when you were born?", "NTA. Just because your sister is pregnant does not mean she loses her bodily autonomy. Your grandmother is being entitled. Does she normally get hysterical when told no? Let her drift. Your parents are also enabling her bad behaviour. Saying she\u2019s old is an excuse not to do anything about her bad behaviours. This should be about what your sister wants and her needs and comfort should be paramount. I\u2019d ask both your mom & dad why they\u2019re so comfortable letting grandma run loose over your sister. Especially considering she\u2019s pregnant and should be keeping her stress low. May want to tell your sister not to let anyone know when she\u2019s in labour.
