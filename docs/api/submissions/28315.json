That'd be your emotional blackmailer of a grandma.", "NTA. If any relationship is ruined, it's because of grandma.

Who knows what grandma will feel entitled to do with the baby?\n\nYou did good by stopping grandma, and don't let anybody tell you different.", "NTA\n\nNothing else was getting through to GM.

This is on them for letting GM push the issue to the brink.", "NTA. Your sister is lucky to have you as her champion. If your family's relationship with your grandma is ruined for good, it's entirely because of your grandma's entitlement. I understand how your parents' bizarrely enabling reaction may be confusing to you, but you are entirely in the right. Grandma is not entitled to any violations of your or your sister's boundaries, and if she stays out of your way, what with all her crying, hysterics, and carrying on, maybe it's just as well. Let your parents kiss up to her if they are so concerned. It doesn't sound like you and your sister are missing much. You are going to be an awesome aunt to this baby.", "NTA\n\nEnjoy the quiet while she's gone... it won't last. But sticking up for your sis and protecting her is the right thing to do. Tell your parents it's their job to keep Grandma from harassing your pregnant sister, but since they failed to do so, you stepped up, and you'll keep stepping up as she's stressing your sis out. That's bad for the health of both mother and the baby. \n\nIf Grandma shows up again (which I suspect she will, I'd tell her if she can't zip it over being present at the birth, she sure as hell won't see the baby after its born.

I\u2019m sorry your parents didn\u2019t agree and I don\u2019t know if or how their minds could be changed, but FWIW definitely NTA. \n\nOn top of it, putting your sister in the stressful position of full chest arguing with someone (\u201cangry and heated and started yelling\u201d), while she is pregnant and in a difficult pregnancy to boot, is selfish. Your sister deserves peace right now as she grows a person, and even if grandma had a leg to stand on in this dispute, it wasn\u2019t handled well on her end.", "NTA, you are a hero for stepping in and backing up your family like that.  Grandma is clearly not behaving like someone who would be included in the delivery room anyway.", "NTA - Grandma needed that reality check....and as soon as she starts crying and going into hysterics, she needs it AGAIN, I would immediately yell \"And crying and having hysterics like a 3 year old throwing a temper tantrum is not going to change our mind! Cut it out! You're a grown adult, not a child! If you keep it up, we won't even let you SEE your grandbaby after its born! Is that how you want things to go?\" Don't soften up on her, stand your ground. She's deliberately trying to emotionally manipulate you guys with all the crocodile tears and stirring up trouble. Don't fall for it, don't let her have her way, don't let her win.", "NTA. That just seems kind of intrusive. I absolutely understand being excited, especially as we get older we're excited to see new generations and that's perfectly understandable.

And maybe she's trying to make up for it with this? If not and she's just genuinely being intrusive and rude I would ask her why she's so insistent on looking at your sister's crotch", "NTA.

Your grandmother needs to dial it back. She doesn't get any special privileges as a grandmother", " TA. In addition to what others have said, stop even discussing stuff like this with her.

If she won't stop, hang up or leave. \n\nI wonder if her great grandmother was present when she was born, and if she had her mother and grandmothers present when she gave birth. Ever since women began to be isolated in hospitals, spectators mostly haven't been around. When i was born in the 50s even fathers were rarely in the room.  Was she in the room when you were born?", "NTA. Just because your sister is pregnant does not mean she loses her bodily autonomy. Your grandmother is being entitled. Does she normally get hysterical when told no? Let her drift. Your parents are also enabling her bad behaviour. Saying she\u2019s old is an excuse not to do anything about her bad behaviours. This should be about what your sister wants and her needs and comfort should be paramount. I\u2019d ask both your mom & dad why they\u2019re so comfortable letting grandma run loose over your sister.

We also have an uncle who we haven\u2019t seen in a while and she claims she was \u201cknocked out\u201d for his birth but I question how that\u2019s possible because it wasn\u2019t a C-section.", "LMAO", "Not everyone here is in agreement lol. Most are though.", "Found the doormat", "We\u2019re considering LC against our mom\u2019s wishes. We\u2019re going to see what happens with her after the baby\u2019s born too.", "Cool, thanks!", "100% NTA.\n\nDoes your grandma have a fair bit of money? Maybe your mom and dad keep appeasing her because they do not want to jeopardize a future inheritance.\n\nIf that doesn't fit your situation, it is still highly likely that your mom was raised by grandma to believe that whatever grandma wants and says must be right and that your mom is supposed to cater to grandma's wishes. Why your dad has bought into that perspective is harder to fathom.\n\nYou and your sister can adopt a less apologetic approach with grandma. Calm but firm responses, not apologizing profusely for things you have every right to decide/protect/do/not do (instead, a simple \"*I'm sure that's disappointing for you, but you will see the baby once we are ready for visitors*.\"), and not entertaining endless repeats of her demands. \"*Grandma, my answer's not changing but the topic is. Did you enjoy the movie you saw last week?*\" If grandma won't drop it, then you walk away or leave. Use the same techniques with your mom if she tries to be grandma's spokesperson.", "Nta. Atta girl Auntie.  Atta girl.", "Same. My touch avoidance comes from an abusive childhood. I don't like being touched. I've pulled away from my own younger sister before and she as innocent as a lamb with regards to what happened to both of us.\n\nI almost clawed one of her high school friend's eyes out because I didn't know he was behind me. I was doing dishes and something grabbed my sides. I didn't make a sound. I just spun around, brought up my hands, and stopped when I registered who it was. I just stared at him. With my hands still up in claw formation. He called to my sister and her response to him was \"did you do what I told you not to do?\" When he said yes, she just said, \"I told you that was a bad idea\".\n\nI felt horrible afterwards because I could have blinded him but she told me not to be. You don't sneak up on a disabled veteran who has ptsd from both childhood trauma and service trauma and grab their sides like that. Like she said, it's a bad idea", "Someone touched my hair when I was pregnant, got told do it again and they wouldn\u2019t have a hand there for long\u2026don\u2019t like being touched by anyone really except my boyfriend and our son much anyway, but that guy just had some kind of courage. Never touched me again though", "Yes, she\u2019ll let the staff know. Thank you so much.", "100% although I think it should be stated that it\u2019s the grandmother ruining the relationship here with her tantrum, not her granddaughter who is simply setting a reasonable boundary with her.", "Probably strangle the baby for being so cute :( NTA OP, she is probably very happy to have a sister like you who sticks up for her and helps her so much :) maybe not call anyone when the day comes and only let the parents go alone and keep it a secret and wait. Your parents on the other hand seems like a handful for enabling her so bad.", "This is more an energy sucking narcissist making happy events all about her.", "Your sister and the baby are family too.  Good thing you put them first and are there to protect them.  Stressing out a pregnant woman can be very bad for mom and baby.\n\nCongrats on the nibbling!", "That\u2019s not a \u201cfamily first\u201d mentality, that\u2019s a \u201cme first\u201d mentality from grandma.\n\nSetting boundaries is a good thing", "I once growled (yes, like a dog, showing my teeth and all) at my mother when she touched my belly. I was pregnant, explained to her how I disliked people randomly touching me without asking. She thought I didn't mean her too. Then tried to argue. The growl ended all argumentations.", "There was a time when it was common for women to be knocked out and babies delivered by forceps.

I am deaf and I hate it when I am at the store and someone will come up behind me and tap me on the shoulder . It scares me half to death. Most people I know know not to poke , tap or tickle me when walking behind me. You want my attention? be standing in front of me!  ( sounds bad lol ) but yeah you do it and scare me ? You will get your ass kicked I won\u2019t even think twice. \n\nNTA but grandma whoa \u2026. Like really lady you want to be up in someone\u2019s hoo ha when they do not want you to be ? Hmm yeah that\u2019s pretty messed up . Mama gets to decide who is gonna be in the room when she gives birth. Grandma is just grandma . Just because she is one does not necessarily mean she can tell people what to do. Definitely needs to stay in her own lane . I\u2019d laugh if my grandmother insisted on that . I\u2019d be like ya nan. I love you but \u2026 no! Just like that cause boundaries y\u2019all!
