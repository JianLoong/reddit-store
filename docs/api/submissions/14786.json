I told my DILs mother she should have paid for her daughters wedding if she wanted her child to feel special.\nFor context I am 48 and have 3 children. My son (32M) and DIL (27F) have been engaged for about 6 years before getting married and claimed the long engagement was due to having small children and needing to save for the day. My daughter (28f) was planning her own wedding and I was heavily involved in it as I was paying for the event and she is my only daughter. I have never been married so planning my daughters wedding was a highlight for me. During the process I helped select all the decorations, the venue, the cars, the dresses for the bridal party and assisted my daughter to make sure everything was perfect for her as i never had the opportunity to have a wedding of my own. As I was mother of the bride I selected a flattering dress designed for women who aren't as young as I am. I was a teen mother and people often think we're siblings. I wanted to look like her mother not her sister or her friend.\nI had  been looking at so many dresses while planning my daughters wedding and found my dream dress which i brought for my sons wedding. It was a corset style top with diamante design on the front and lace up at the back,  then it flowed out from the hips to the floor with a small train. I chose light silver and a matching silver clutch and a small tiara to match the diamontes on the dress. When DIL seen me i could tell she was shocked by how beautiful the dress was and told me i had certainly gone all out and then hugged me. \nWeeks later the photos arrived and I asked her for  copies but she hasn't provided them so I went to her mother to see if she would give me the copies. This is when I was ambushed and was told I was an AH for wearing a wedding dress to their wedding. I explained wedding dresses are white and mine was silver but her mother said it was a wedding dress complete with a train and only her daughter would take something so well.  She also said DIL never asks for anything and never expects to be the centre of anything so taking her one hard saved for day away from her was not ok. I pointed out she could have paid for her daughters wedding like I did for mine if it was so important her daughter gets to feel special. I do feel bad about that comment as I am now working extra shifts to pay the loan for daughters wedding however she started it by attacking me.

I told my DILs mother she should have paid for her daughters wedding if she wanted her child to feel special.\nFor context I am 48 and have 3 children. My son (32M) and DIL (27F) have been engaged for about 6 years before getting married and claimed the long engagement was due to having small children and needing to save for the day. My daughter (28f) was planning her own wedding and I was heavily involved in it as I was paying for the event and she is my only daughter. I have never been married so planning my daughters wedding was a highlight for me. During the process I helped select all the decorations, the venue, the cars, the dresses for the bridal party and assisted my daughter to make sure everything was perfect for her as i never had the opportunity to have a wedding of my own. As I was mother of the bride I selected a flattering dress designed for women who aren't as young as I am. I was a teen mother and people often think we're siblings. I wanted to look like her mother not her sister or her friend.\nI had  been looking at so many dresses while planning my daughters wedding and found my dream dress which i brought for my sons wedding. It was a corset style top with diamante design on the front and lace up at the back,  then it flowed out from the hips to the floor with a small train. I chose light silver and a matching silver clutch and a small tiara to match the diamontes on the dress. When DIL seen me i could tell she was shocked by how beautiful the dress was and told me i had certainly gone all out and then hugged me. \nWeeks later the photos arrived and I asked her for  copies but she hasn't provided them so I went to her mother to see if she would give me the copies. This is when I was ambushed and was told I was an AH for wearing a wedding dress to their wedding. I explained wedding dresses are white and mine was silver but her mother said it was a wedding dress complete with a train and only her daughter would take something so well.  She also said DIL never asks for anything and never expects to be the centre of anything so taking her one hard saved for day away from her was not ok. I pointed out she could have paid for her daughters wedding like I did for mine if it was so important her daughter gets to feel special. I do feel bad about that comment as I am now working extra shifts to pay the loan for daughters wedding however she started it by attacking me.

You wore a light silver floor length gown with a train, beading, and a tiara and you now have the nerve to be insulted someone pointed out how ridiculous you were?\n\nThere\u2019s a whole subreddit that makes fun of people of pull this kind of shit at weddings.", "YTA. However,  I really wanna see pics of this dress.", "YTA why do you want to pretend to marry your son? Is the picture, you are so eagerly waiting on, one with just you and son? Lmao wearing a wedding dress and a tiara is fucking hilarious. A corset really? Like a moulin rouge extra. I\u2019m so embarrassed for you. Do you even know how ridiculous you looked and are acting?", "This has to be clickbait parody or something. Nobody is this dense are they? Just in case you are absolutely TA.", "YTA and sound like a nightmare. Completely hijacked your own daughters wedding and wore a wedding style dress and ball gown? Talk about tacky", "YTA. A tiara? to a wedding? Any dress that can resemble a wedding dress, especially with diamond like accents--and then to deflect and tell the bride's mother that it's HER fault that she didn't predict that you'd hijack the limelight. What does payment have to do with this?  Someone else's wedding is NOT your stage.", "YTA...For the fucking tiara alone. \n\n\n You knew damn good and well your dress was bridal (they aren't JUST white anymore). Long LITE silver, corset with embroidered jewels, laced back and small train. Why not post a picture with this? I'm assuming the dress is still in tour closet?", "YTA - You're just a really bad person and I guarantee everyone was making fun of you at the wedding but was too polite to say it to your face! They were all laughing at how ridiculous you are. Don't be surprised if your son and DIL start avoiding you. Also don't be surprised if you're cut out of all the photos or they just choose ones you aren't in.", "YTA. Congratulations\u2026you just showed everyone what a psychotic and delusional narcissist you are. A silver gown with a train?  Seriously?\n\nDid you invite yourself on their honeymoon as well?", "YTA for what you said. I\u2019m not sure what difference it makes who paid for the wedding. You would have worn the same thing thus not changing how special your DIL felt. \n\nThe fact that your dress had a train, and you accessorized with a tiara also makes you TA.", "YTA. A silver gown, especially the one you described, is still highly inappropriate and very much wedding-dress-like. Your whole post reads as pretty narcissistic too. You wanted to be the centre of attention and aren\u2019t sorry even when confronted.", "Except for Amy on The Big Bang Theory:).", "I\u2019m not going to lie. I would have loved to have been a guest at this wedding. This kind of tacky nonsense is so entertaining.

TIARA!!!\nTHIS WASN'T YOUR DAY TO BE A PRINCESS.", "There is almost zero chance this post is real. Most people who are this self-absorbed hide what they did better than this story. This story basically paints the picture of a young mom who stole her daughter's wedding day and made it into HER dream day. It also paints the picture of someone who has probably spent her life being parented by her daughter, who is more mature than the mother. If OP is a real person who did this, she should get into therapy and leave her daughter alone, so she can have a happy life without her.\n\nThere's just... no way this is real.", "ALL OF THIS", "OP was 20 when the daughter was born. I have a cousin 20 years younger than me, and we\u2019ve never been mistaken for sisters.

She is in HR.", "Actually, she wore an role appropriate dress to her daughter's wedding, because she did not want to steal her daughter's thunder.  But, while finding an appropriate dress for her daughter's wedding, she found her \"dream dress\" plus tiara to wear to her DIL's wedding. She was fine with allowing her daughter be the center of attention, but DIL was not near as important as her daughter.\n\nAfter all, this was her chance to pretend to be a bride since she never got the chance to have a wedding of her own.\n\nShe sent a big ass message to her son and DIL.

Or the couple does it themselves.", "As long as she acts befitting of a tiara, this is acceptable", "That is what people like her don\u2019t realize-they are only the center of attention because they look foolish, not admired.  She was being laughed at.  YTA", "And she keeps saying DIL\u2019s wedding \u2026 instead of \u201cMy son\u2019s wedding\u201d.  Wordplay to make herself not seem so bad.
