I said that the money I had saved was in investments and stocks not in a 529. I have a few thousand in there to get some tax benefits though. She said she wants to use the money to give to her bf for his college. I was furious and told her he needs to be paying for college on his own but she argued he will love her for helping her with college and he will marry her and they can start a family together. I have no idea why she wants to get married so soon, she and her bf had a rocky relationship and I wanted him gone but my wife kept saying dating is a part of teenage life and she will smarten up eventually. \n\nNow she wants to stay with him and move with him when he goes to college in a nearby city. I asked her how she plans on taking care of herself and she said she can find a job and rent an apartment and after her bf is finished college he can find a job. I told her it never works out the way people plan and she needs to get an education or at least work and make money for herself and not chase after him. She started crying and yelling that I didn\u2019t understand her and she and him were going to workout. My wife and I are shocked because she was serious about college and was already applied to several. \n\nToday she asked me for the money I had promised her to pay for her college. I told her a couple thousand was in 529 and that I couldn\u2019t control if she took it out but most of it was in my investment accounts which she couldn\u2019t take from. She said she wanted it for her bf and I told her over my dead body which led to her screaming and crying more that I was ruining her relationship. I\u2019m still stumped as to why she wants to give up her college dreams to chase after her bf who she has been on again off again for 2 years. My wife and I have asked her and the only response we\u2019ve gotten is she loves him and she thinks it will work out.

And, he can always choose in the future to help pay of student loan debt or put down money for daughter's house or retirement, etc. \n\nIf OP is right and there is something nefarious going on with the boyfriend, it will be important that he's secured the resources she needs to escape and get back on her feet when she realizes she's in a bad situation. \n\nI'd also wonder how much of this plan is daughter's plan-v- boyfriend's plan. OP said daughter and boyfriend have been on and off for 2 years, and daughter's request is a sudden change from her previous plans. That makes me also wonder if this is her way to \"keep\" boyfriend when he wanted to break up to be \"free\" going into college.", "I kind of feel the boyfriend put her up for this.  Told her he would benefit more and promised her the moon and a pony.  He'd dump her the moment he had the money.", "And very likely the bf is waiting for the golden goose to deliver him the money and then dump her. The bf is up to no good", "It sounds like he wants to leave her for good, since OP says they're on/off again. Daughter thinks that giving him money to pay for his college will make him indebted to her and so they will be TOGETHER 4EVA like in the movies. It sounds like she's desperate enough that she might even get herself \"accidentally\" pregnant so that he'll be stuck with her forever.", "The bf could be likely to pull the easy money scheme just to get his hands on money that is not his", "NTA. Please hold strong on this.\n\n\nOP, I would seriously recommend gently nudging your daughter towards therapy. Don't bring it up anywhere ***near*** a conversation about her boyfriend. I am concerned that she believes that she can buy love. This is a problem that may last for many years, until she figures it out. It will cause a lot of hurt. If she has a therapist, I might be worth mentioning. The therapist can't tell you squat, but sometimes they listen to outside people. Sometimes they can help better if they know more about the situation.\n\n\nIMO, if he was a good boyfriend, he would be encouraging her to do the same things that you're trying to encourage her to do. I would be horrified at the thought of my partner losing the chance at education over me. I would be ***mortified*** if it came from my partner's parent's savings that were meant for my partner.\n\n\n\nWhen you love someone, you want the best for them. You don't let them screw themselves out of a future for you, you know?", "NTA ...there is more behind this. Dig deeper is what I would say.....heavily manipulated....abusive relationship,. She has lost all sense of self it seems", "NTA. Time to seek some professional assistance from a therapist. Expecting you to pay foe someone else\u2019s college education so he will love her is not reasonable or rational. Do look into it.", "NTA.  You are stumped as to why your daughter wants to give money to her BF?  Really?  She wants to do it because she thinks she needs to buy his love.  She's 18.  She isn't thinking maturely.  Don't give her any money but keep in contact with her so when the relationship ends (and you already know it most likely will end) she knows she can come back to you and your wife for comfort and support.  Just because she isn't going to college right now doesn't mean she can't enroll later.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nThose funds are in your control and you have the right to say no (even the 529 if it's in your name with her as beneficiary).\n\nYou need to have a conversation with your daughter, telling her that this is your and your wife's money that you have worked hard to save and invest for your daughter's benefit.  If she chooses not to go to college, tell her what expenses you might be willing to use the funds for (a house down payment later in life, a well-thought-out business, etc...). \n\nTell your daughter that her BF's college expenses are the responsibility of himself and his family.  If he can't afford the college he wants to attend, he can take out loans or attend a less expensive school.  Tell her that if her BF or his family are pressuring her to give him her college money, that's a sign of financial abuse.  Someone who would take her college money for themselves would have no qualms with frivolously spending money she has saved up to pay her rent.  Even if she does follow her BF to his new town and choose to work, she needs to keep her own banks account and spend her money on herself not on her BF.  \n\nTell her that you understand there may be aspects of all this she doesn't want to tell her Dad. Offer to help her find a Therapist to discuss things with if she thinks that might help.  Tell her that you will always love her, and your money will be waiting until she is ready to use it to improve her future.\n\n(My guess is the BF has found out his parents aren't going to help him with college costs and he's manipulating your daughter to try to take her college savings for himself.  Wouldn't surprise me if it was his idea that your daughter can work and pay their rent too.  Huge red flags if that's the case.  This could easily be an abusive relationship.)", "Nta. You saved that money for her education, not his, point blank. The idea of you paying for her bf\u2019s education is ludicrous and doesn\u2019t deserve further discussion. She\u2019s proving how immature and foolish she is by even asking.", "NTA, don't know if its even going to last yet", "NTA. I would recommend trying to get her into therapy though because her relationship sounds incredibly unhealthy, whether she is being pressured by him or trying to buy his love.", "NTA. That\u2019s not her money. It was intended to help her with college not some guy she\u2019s seeing. This isn\u2019t about age this is to do with an unhealthy relationship which may or may not be to do with her. Maybe see about therapy.", "NTA\n\nTell her you will give her plan the consideration it deserves only after she has consulted with a therapist, a career advisor, and a financial advisor. Don\u2019t crush your child - she will only be drawn further towards the boyfriend.\n\nI was an idiot at 18 too and I am so sorry for the stupid things I did \u2018for love\u2019 at the time. I\u2019m 36 now and so grateful I\u2019m no longer with the AH I was with at 18 and we have no ties. Being there for your daughter doesn\u2019t mean letting her throw your money away. You saved that money for her to go to college, not for someone else to go to college and not for her to spend as she wishes. If she doesn\u2019t want to go to college she doesn\u2019t automatically get the money, certainly not before she\u2019s of an age to be sensible about it, like 25+ years old. \n\n(Also the consideration it deserves means \u2018I have thought about this for two seconds and I still say no, because it\u2019s insane.\u2019)", "Let her fall and let her pick up the pieces. You have made life too comfortable for her. Reality sucks and its time she faces it.  NTA", "NTA, but the reason to not let her have that money is that she may come back in a year or two and say she wants to go to college after all.  My daughter did,  and thank goodness I hadn't released any of that money yet so we could pay for her..", "NTA\n\nWorst case scenario, you give her ask the money, she gives it all to her boyfriend, he drains her dry and leaves her for good. Broken and broke daughter comes crying to you.\n\nBest case scenario, things go great and bf makes the money back with his new job and they live happily ever after.\n\nShe's 18 and fully believes that her (sometimes) boyfriend is the one and only she's going to spend her life with and that she should put all her eggs (and yours) into his basket. That's just asking for betrayal.\n\nIf she's so caught up in this that she can't see the risks, she should consider therapy. It really sounds like she's given up on everything and that her bf is her last hope, or else.", "NTA - young and in love.  I'm leaving dumb out because she probably isn't.  I was young and dumb once too.  \n\nGive her the couple thousand and tell her the rest is locked up unless she is on college or turns 30 and that's how the trust is set up.  Just make up something about how it accidentally went into your 401k instead of a 529 and you can begin pulling it out when she's 30.\n\nPeriod.", "NTA", "If she was looking at colleges and all the sudden changed her mind it\u2019s possible she\u2019s being manipulated by the boyfriend.", "Or she\u2019s pregnant", "This. The money in the 529 isn't hers, it's just designated for her education. It's actually yours and can be transferred to any other family member for their education. My son is 24 and I'm still the only to make the withdrawals for his college expenses.", "I don\u2019t think so, some teenagers really are this dim when it comes to their feelings and relationships. It\u2019s very plausible she wants to fund his college at the expense of hers, especially if he\u2019s promised her that she can be a housewife and doesn\u2019t have to work once he\u2019s graduated.\n\nThey may well both mean what they say *now*, but their feelings will change as they mature and they need saving from themselves at this point.", "NTA.  This has disaster written all over it.", "NTA I'm guessing the boyfriend is threatening to dump her if she doesn't get the money", "NTA. Do not give her or him any money. People mature at different rates. She may well change her mind in a few years and decide to go to college then. Leave the door open for her if she goes.", "NTA. Oh honey, noooo. I want to snap your daughter back to reality. Eighteen and ready to throw thousands of dollars at a dude to better his  future without securing her own? Noooooo", "NTA, explain to her that while she will work for the two of them, he will study,have fun,  in the end he will probably leave her for some girl who will finish college and make more money than her.", "NTA. I get that it's hard to understand and is obviously a bad choice to you. But, speaking as somebody in their mid twenties and still learning a LOT, teenagers are dumb. Everything is the most important thing in the world, including her rocky relationship. Absolutely don't give him/her any of that money though. He will 100% take it and run.", "Is she pregnant?", "NTA\u2026but don\u2019t abandon her. She\u2019ll need a safe place to come back to once the relationship is over. Just let her know that the money will always be there for her when she\u2019s ready to pursue something.\n\nHe\u2019s trying to isolate her. Sounds like first love.", "I laughed out loud. Kids are so so stupid. NTA.", "NTA. Explain to her that, if you not giving her the money will ruin their relationship, the relationship is already doomed anyway. Point out to her that this isn't how a healthy relationship is built and that her plan to do this so he'll love her is, emotionally, very flawed. \n\nGet her to therapy and mention to the therapist that you're worried she's in an abusive relationship. Maybe make an agreement with her that she can have part of the money if she is serious about therapy for at least 6 months. She needs perspective to realize this is abusive, and she's not open hearing you as her parents.", "NTA. He's pressuring your daughter for that money and possibly threatening to break it off if she doesn't get it for him. If he truly loves her and wants to be with and marry her  then that money should not matter! Sad thing is - she can't see it now but no doubt after he receives that money he will ghost and eventually dump her. Happens all the time.", "NTA\n\nIt sounds like that bf *manipulated* her into giving up on college and paying for his tuition and in return he'll \"love her forever\"\n\nAre his parents as bad as him? Are they aware of this?", "NtA\nDon't give her a dime. She may want to go to school later when the real world bites her in bum and she breaks it off with the bf", "NTA a college fund isn't a right and the principle behind such things has always been about trying to give your kids the best head start in life.  If they don't want to go to college then asking to use it for something else e.g. learning a trade or starting a business (check that this is viable not pipe dreams though) is reasonable.  Alternatively, it would be valid to offer the money as a deposit on a house in a few years once she's established herself and can afford things like mortgage payments on her own.\n\nUltimately though, if you treated the money as an investment in her education (and were consistent with any other kids you have) then it's fine to say that she's not getting the money period.  If she decides in a year or two to go to college and it's still there then great, if not then cool your retirement just got moved up a few years!  The idea that you'd pay for her boyfriend's college is delusional.", "Speaking of that is it possible she is pregnant? Hopefully not", "Also possible she is pregnant and not wanting to tell her parents yet.", "Oh, yeah.  I think he's pressuring her for the money.  He's selling her a line of BS.", "I believe it is only marital if they intentionally consolidate their loans together.", "I'd definitely check the local laws.", "Yep, I think the money in a 529 belongs to the person who opened the account, not the intended beneficiary. She has no legal claim to it and cannot remove money from it without OP\u2019s consent.", "I actually agree here that she's being truthful and she really does wanna pay for her BF to go to college.  Ah young love...lol...", "I bet bf is the mastermind behind this change.  \"If you love me yada yada....\"", "YES. Based on the post I agree that BF could in fact be lying to OP's daughter about what he really wants to use the money for. \"He will love her for helping with college and he will marry her and they can  start a family together.\"  Lol.", "NTA, yeah this is the time to be a parent and be a bad guy. She's making a terrible mistake turning herself into an open wallet for this guy to use, keep the money away from her. If you will allow her to take the money now you will allow her to steal from her own possible future. Whereas if you safeguard it for now, if or when she exits this relationship she would have the opportunity to be able to go to school and start her own life.", "NTA: Plus, I\u2019m pretty sure YOU will have to pay a tax liability if you give him the 529 money.", "NTA. She\u2019s young, dumb and in love. The more you push her to go to college, break up with the bf etc, the more your me pushing her away. She\u2019ll realize and learn eventually or she won\u2019t, but she\u2019s an adult now and should make her own decisions and mistakes to hopefully learn from. But giving her the money that YOU saved for HeR college his off the table. She chooses not to go to school, that\u2019s on her. But you\u2019re not responsible to pay her bf\u2019s tuition so that \u201che loves her more, will marry her, and start a family with her\u201d. No way!! If i were in your shoes, that\u2019s exactly what I would tell her. She\u2019s free to make her own decisions and choices, but you are not paying her bf\u2019s tuition in hopes that her master plan of marriage and a family come to life. If she wants that for herself, then she needs to work for it herself. Keep the money in the investments either for her to go to college if she changes her mind, or to do whatever you want with.", "NTA daughter seems to be trying to buy his love, obviously you can't stop her leaving with him but yeah I wouldn't be paying for it", "nta, your daughter is acting very dumb and immature. don't give her the money", "NTA.\n\nShe's admitted trying to buy his love. It's been a rocky relationship and you're probably seeing her desperately trying to make it not end. Obviously this won't work in the long run. Hang on to the college fund for when she realizes for herself that she needs it. Her lashing out has nothing to do with you personally and everything to do with her own emotional turmoil.", "NTA but it\u2019s time to talk to her about abusive relationships and self advocacy. She\u2019s in deep and this is not a good partner if he\u2019s actually expecting these funds.", "NTA but it seems like she won\u2019t smarten up on her own. Talk to her or suggest taking her to therapy and maybe then she can get a wake up call.", "NTA. I\u2019d hang on to all that money for the day that she comes home after her relationship fails and realizes life as an adult isn\u2019t as simple as she thinks. Basically, she\u2019ll still need it for college (or trade school or a career certification, etc). She\u2019ll thank ya later. Geez", "NTA. Tell her that if the only way he'll love and marry her is if she pays him to, his love is not worth it.", "NTA, she thinks she can convince him to be serious about the relationship if she can do this for him...but it won't work out. Stay strong, encourage her  to go to someplace she's been accepted, and ask why they can't BOTH go to college and work after? If it's good for the gander...", "Agreed.", "That's the most likely scenario, she probably mentioned that her dad has a lot of money put down to pay for her education and the wheels started turning in his brain", "This was my first thought as well", "You can't do that any longer in the US. Found that out when my hubs and I asked about it.", "He may even genuinely want the money for college and even have romantic ideas himself, it\u2019s just not realistic or sustainable. He may well *now* intend on making a life with her and paying back her investment in him with marriage etc\u2026 but they\u2019re so young that when they do mature and realise they\u2019re not going to be together forever it will get nasty because he will be morally indebted to her if not financially. There\u2019s no way this can end well, even if they are starting out with mutually good intentions.", "Yup, I can totally see this as well. They both could actually very young and so naive..."]}
