I said that the money I had saved was in investments and stocks not in a 529. I have a few thousand in there to get some tax benefits though. She said she wants to use the money to give to her bf for his college. I was furious and told her he needs to be paying for college on his own but she argued he will love her for helping her with college and he will marry her and they can start a family together. I have no idea why she wants to get married so soon, she and her bf had a rocky relationship and I wanted him gone but my wife kept saying dating is a part of teenage life and she will smarten up eventually. \n\nNow she wants to stay with him and move with him when he goes to college in a nearby city. I asked her how she plans on taking care of herself and she said she can find a job and rent an apartment and after her bf is finished college he can find a job. I told her it never works out the way people plan and she needs to get an education or at least work and make money for herself and not chase after him. She started crying and yelling that I didn\u2019t understand her and she and him were going to workout. My wife and I are shocked because she was serious about college and was already applied to several. \n\nToday she asked me for the money I had promised her to pay for her college. I told her a couple thousand was in 529 and that I couldn\u2019t control if she took it out but most of it was in my investment accounts which she couldn\u2019t take from. She said she wanted it for her bf and I told her over my dead body which led to her screaming and crying more that I was ruining her relationship. I\u2019m still stumped as to why she wants to give up her college dreams to chase after her bf who she has been on again off again for 2 years. My wife and I have asked her and the only response we\u2019ve gotten is she loves him and she thinks it will work out. I get she\u2019s young and doesn\u2019t understand what real relationships are like but I\u2019m worried it more nefarious and I won\u2019t be giving away any money.", "created_utc": 1667961752, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yq6d2p/aita_for_refusing_to_let_my_daughter_take_out/", "score": 56, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If they get married your daughter will inherit his student debt anyways.", "NTA this is a lesson your daughter needs to learn. Her bf sounds like he is pressuring her for the money.", "Nta. I\u2019m so sad for her that she feels she needs to buy his love. She\u2019s trying to change the course of her future for this guy. She\u2019s following him because she thinks if she doesn\u2019t, that he will cheat on her. This is all so very sad, but you are not ruining their relationship because it sounds like it\u2019s on its last leg anyways and she\u2019s trying to keep it going. Talk with her when you both calm down. Ask her why she suddenly doesn\u2019t want to go. Explain that if the relationship is destined to work out, it will survive the distance. She\u2019s a kid who thinks she\u2019s in her forever relationship. I\u2019m sure you and your wife both remember that. Someone needs to have a calm conversation with her. Her self esteem clearly needs a boost.", "Honestly I'm worried that her boyfriend is pushing her to ask for this money for his education, and making promise's he has no intention of keeping.  Have you considered offering to get her some counseling?  NTA for saying no.  That money was saved for a purpose, her education.", "NTA protect yourself and your daughter.\n\nIf their relationship works out, you can always give her the money later but there's no id give my 18 year old money to finance someone else's education.\n\nLook at it this way, bf has tuition taken care off (thanks to you) meanwhile your daughter is working who knows how many hours to pay bills.\n\nLet her cry, she'll thank you in the end.", "NTA. Protect her from this. I don\u2019t want to sound condescending towards her, but she\u2019s young and doesn\u2019t know any better. You do.", "NTA but please use some of that money to get her into therapy to find some self-esteem.", "NTA that money is for your child\u2019s education not for her to spend or give away. If chooses not to go to school at this point, she may in the future and if not it could go towards a house when the time is right, which is definitely not now", "NTA. Do you think he could be being emotionally abusive to her? I can\u2019t see any other reason why a young lady would completely give up on herself and put everything towards him unless he gave her an ultimatum. Maybe he said they were going to take a break when he left for college and she thinks this is the only way to make him stay? Either way I think you need to tell her that your condition for giving her the information about the 529 is that she needs to start seeing a therapist. Maybe they can help her gain confidence back?", "NTA. Explain that she may owe some taxes on that 529 money if it\u2019s not used for her college expenses. \nIt sounds like she is trying to buy his love. That\u2019s really sad but you may have to let it play out. She can move out and realize it isn\u2019t great living with no money. It sounds like you have tried talking to her about how this is going to go badly for her if she moves with him. Is there anyone else that she trusts that she could talk too?", "NTA-young love seems so easy at first get jobs, little apartment and everything works out well.  \n\nYou are making the right decision on this one.  Unfortunately she will probably not see your side till she grows older and wiser.  \n\nEven if this young love works out.  It is not a good idea for her to give him money for college, she will still need it for herself. \n\nGood luck parenring is never easy.", "NTA. That money is for HER college. If she doesn\u2019t want to go to college then she doesn\u2019t get the money. Save those funds for your retirement dude and let your daughter learn life the hard way.", "NTA. I think more parents need to make it more clear to their children that college money is for their education only. If they don't go, they don't get it. That's how I'd do it, anyways. \n\nI wouldn't pay a cent for her boyfriend's education. That's not your problem. To be honest, there's a slim chance they will even stay together for the long run. I get that it's not impossible, but either way it's not your job to fund his way.", "Awe young and past dumb but you still love her. One day she will regret trying to give him money...you know when she realizes what kind of special he is and how it\u2019s not the good kind of special. Keep up the good work dad and remind her that it\u2019s your money to spend how you want and you\u2019re not paying for his college", "So NTA. The 529 is a goner, but the rest is still yours, not hers. Stand firm.", "NTA.  It is your money. Not hers.  You didn't scrimp and save for all those years to pay for some dude you don't know and highly likely won't be around in a few years. You told her that you would use that money to pay for \\*her\\* college.  Not that it was some general slush fund for her. \n\nPlus, your daughter doesn't seem even remotely mature, or well (sorry, no better way to say it) not dumb enough to be able to handle large amounts of money.", "NTA. It's good that just a small portion of her college fund was in the 529 so she won't blow the rest of the money on the BF.\n\nYou are right in not giving her anything of what's in your investment accounts because it's clear that this won't work out well for her.

At 18 she is not going to be making smart relationship or financial decisions.  You need to hold steady looking out for her best interests. \n\n1) This is not her money.  It is money that you earned and set aside for a specific use.  If she chooses to not attend college then she doesn't have any claim to your money.\n\n2) With no job skills or education she would most likely not be able to support herself and her BF.  Minimum wage jobs just don't pay enough for that.  \n\n3) The likelihood of their relationship lasting through his schooling and to marriage is miniscule.   She NEEDS to have skills to support herself in the long run.  This means college or trade skills.  Even a lot of office positions will want certificates and will pay minimum wage for years.  \n\n4) At 18 her primary concern needs to be HER future, not her BF's.  He can worry about his own, and he doesn't get to use money saved aside for her.\n\nNo matter what she chooses, save that money aside.

HER college fund.  No college = no money.  Lord knows what dreams this guy is attempting to fill her head with!  She needs to take some nice deep breaths and put her focus back on what will best secure her own well being and future.  She may be thinking that the college fund money will just be hers to spend as she wants, if she decides to skip going, so you'd be wise to nip that one in the bud, pronto.", "NTA. Do not give her that money. It sounds like the BF might be manipulating her.", "What kind of relationship do they have?  Is it abusive or manipulative?  She should focus on her dreams and future.   Maybe some counseling.", "NTA", "Dad, don't doubt yourself for a moment on this.  Her 'plan' is such a bad idea that I don't have sufficient words.

I got a bad feeling about her bf and he could be controlling her to the point she is willing to give up her uni/college dreams. Let her be mad at you and do not cave in to her. Give us an update OP. \n\nEdit: Papa OP, I suggest you get in touch with a private investigator or get a friend with good sleuthing skills to dig into the bf.

Might be a fun self - destruct lol", "Have you met her boyfriend?  I wonder how old he is and what he has been telling her.  FYI - since you said no, she\u2019s going to go to the end of the earth with him. Tell her to get a job now, start saving for an apartment. Let her start adulting, live in the real world so she can get a glimpse of how the world works without a plan or additional education.", "NTA - if that money isn't in her name, hold it until she decides to go to college or trade school or something for her and then pay the school directly making sure any refunds come back to you. If she wants to use the money to buy a house, make sure the house is in her name only. She will support him while he is in school and then he will likely move on and hopefully there won't be an innocent child to complicate things.", "NTA. A family member gave her college money to her scam artist boyfriend who said he was going to win a prize worth several times as much if he could use her money.
