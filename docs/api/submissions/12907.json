A week out, I asked her not to make any plans for her birthday obviously stating that I had made evening plans for us (dinner at this restaurant she's been talking about for ages, dessert and then a drive to go stargazing). I had been hinting around it all week to Cora. I also asked if her friends wanted to celebrate with her. They told me at the time they had \"not figured anything out yet\" so I assumed they weren't doing anything and then made my plans. \n\nThe day of Cora's birthday comes and she leaves in the afternoon. I thought no big deal, she was probably having some birthday time to herself. She hadn't posted on her story or anything so I didn't think anything of it. 6pm rolls around, I'd messaged and called her and still nothing so I checked her location because she normally replies very quick (we have each others for safety reasons) and she was at one of her friends houses. So I asked her friend if she'd seen my girlfriend because I had a birthday surprise set up for her. \n\nTurns out that her friends did make plans for her birthday and didn\u2019t tell me because they thought I would \"ruin the surprise\" and \"wanted it to be a complete secret\" They had lunch and then made more plans to go out to some bars and celebrate. They then invited me but I declined out of politeness and not wanting to crash their plans since she sees her friends rarely outside of work. I messaged Cora to have a good night with her friends and I'll see her when I get home (I had a cake waiting for her and thought nothing of it and hung with a couple of my friends).\n\nCora came home and was angry I turned down her friends invitation and she wanted to see me with all of her friends on her birthday too. I said it wasn't a big deal and that I saw her in the morning and when she got home anyway. I also said that the invite felt like an afterthought when she had all the time during the day to invite me and she didn't.

Both Cora and her friends knew you had something planned that evening.

She was acting angry cause she was caught being the a hole along with her friends and felt guilty for blowing you off. Talk about gaslighting.", "This is tough. You say you told her not to make plans as you had obviously made plans for the evening. Her then ignoring those plans and not saying anything to you is pretty annoying. You also asked her friends. Again, sounds like they knew you made plans (but maybe you just asked and never confirmed with them you did in fact lock something in). \n\nThe friends put you in a bad spot by making plans and leaving you out of them so the plans weren\u2019t ruined. Your girl also knew you had plans and chose her friends plans over a night with you. The invite does sound like an afterthought. \n\nI\u2019m gonna go with NTA on this. I\u2019m assuming your communication was on point and everyone was aware of your birthday plans.", "NTA. She ghosted you on her birthday, then got pissed when you turned down a last-minute invite from one of her friends. If she really wanted you there, she would have responded to your attempts to contact her.", "NTA\nShe was very inconsiderate of the fact that you made plans", "NTA\n\nYou repeatedly let her know you had plans for her birthday. The entire day she couldn't send  you one text regarding what her plans were and actually asked you herself to join in?\n\nIt is bad enough she didn't let you know that you both might have to cancel the plans you had made for her, but she also gets mad at you for declining an offer that was definitely an afterthought?\n\nShe sounds like a piece of work. Her friends deliberately didn't tell you about their plans, and only invited you when you called to check in on your girlfriend because she couldn't bother to pick up a call or answer a text.", "NTA\n\nThey did not tell you because you were not invited.  Then the day of your GF goes off with her friends and does not think to contact you, so you were not her concern.  She has shown you where you rate, so listen.", "NTA.\n\nI could fault you for lacking in communication - with your plans, you should have asked her to be ready to go by (whatever time), even if you didn't want to tell her the specific plans. \n\nBut that doesn't even come close to the complete lack of communication from Cora and her friends. Cora ditched you on her birthday (which I wouldn't necessarily fault her for if you hadn't said you had plans, she has a right to decide), and completely failed to communicate with you. Her friends are full of crap when they say why they didn't invite you - you were not invited, period. The offer to join them was clearly an afterthought.\n\nThe idea that Cora is angry with you is complete bullshit. If you were at all important to her, she would have at least told you when and where she was going and when she'd be back.\n\nSounds like she and her friends are trying to torpedo your relationship.", "NTA - I can understand how she might have become overwhelmed with a birthday surprise and forgotten you made plans. \n\nThe friends, however, suck.

Considering the occasion, it\u2019s obvious that you want to make plans for her and that\u2019s why you were asking. I\u2019d be really upset if this happened to me.", "NTA. Her friends lied to you, your GF did answer your calls and text. You were only invited after you reached out to one of her friends. You were definitely an afterthought. \n\nThe only way I could see your GF being reasonable is if she thought you asked about plans as a way to help her friends plan the \u201csurprise\u201d. \n\nMaybe she did ask about you, and they claimed they invited you and you never showed up.", "NTA, this was kinda a tough call but in the end you were never informed of what was going on and weren't invited until you probed her friends as to what was happening.

Terrible communication on Cora's and her friends side. It's overall weird to me that she just left without saying what's she going to do, don't you usually talk about such things?

That\u2019s on her.", "NTA you made it known you had plans to do something for her birthday. i also feel like her friends should\u2019ve included you more in the birthday plans they were making rather than assuming you would ruin the surprise. it makes me think they didn\u2019t want you there and that you were an afterthought since they ended up inviting you last minute.", "NTA. You were not even invited. That you were invited after you called just looks like an afterthought as it would be pretty rude to tell you that there's a party going on for your gf and still not ask you to join.\n\nBut overall pretty bad communication from everybody involved. If you wanted to invite her to dinner you should have told her that you want to treat her on her birthday and that she should be available for the evening. You also should not have assumed that her friends telling you \"not having figured anything out yet\" means \"we totally have no plans at all\". Your gf should have told you that there's party for her at least as soon as she learned about it. And her friends should either have trusted you with being able to keep the secrect or surprise-invited you at the same as her.\n\nAll this sounds to me that there is more behind the surface of this botched birthday celebration.", "There was a weirdly similar situation on here with almost identical wording on the part about asking the friends except in that one the guy only hinted he might have plans by asking his gf\n\nRegardless it does change the situation to NTA if you've clearly told her you have evening plans which will be a surprise and she's ignored it", "This right here. OP told the friends you made plans. OP told Cora you made plans. Neither the friends nor Cora could be bothered to remember that?\n\nNTA OP. But, it sounds like there needs to be a discussion about communication expectations going forward, or this relationship is not going to last.", "Maybe that was my mistake not fully confirming the times of things with her friends? But yeah they knew I had some sort of evening plans and their bar plans were to go out all night", "I just let her know I would reschedule to celebrate another day and told her to have fun with her friends, I didn't let her know what I'd planned so it could still be somewhat of a surprise", "That's what I was thinking. None of the other partners of her friends were with them either so I thought it was better I let her enjoy herself and to stay behind", "Thats what I thought? \n\n\nI usually tell my partner if I am going out with someone. Or discuss my plans. I thought it was weird too that she just left without saying anything.", "She did, I asked her a week ago if she was busy on her birthday. Throughout the week I hinted, things like \"I hope you're excited for your birthday, I've got something cool planned in the evening\" I didn't explicitly say what it was but I made sure she knew something was being planned for us in the evening. Had I known her friends also wanted to do something, I would have worked it out with them", "She did, she apologised for not making our plans but she said she didn't want to apologise for spending time with her friends and that I should have been there anyway because I could still see her for the evening like I planned anyway. But I felt that was a half apology and she's angry about it. I get it, she doesn't see her friends a lot due to work and other plans we make but still", "Yeah, I'm definitely going to reschedule and tell her we have concrete dinner plans with a time whenever I can find a day that works for us. It's just a shame, I know she would have loved it had we gone on her birthday", "Why. Her friends obviously didn\u2019t want him there, and that\u2019s not his fault. He didn\u2019t get an invite until *after* he started calling/texting looking for her.\nHe could absolutely say \u201chey, since we didn\u2019t get to do my plans on your birthday, how about next Saturday?\u201d, but he shouldn\u2019t have to apologize for her friends excluding him.", "In the morning? I made her breakfast and gave her a card wishing happy birthday", "So Cora should have invited him. But she didn't, did she?\n\nOP was invited by Cora's friend, that too was not an effort that was made by the friend. He was invited, when he called to check in on Cora. Definitely an afterthought and definitely not invited because he was wanted there. \n\nAt no point did Cora pick up her phone and answer OP's calls or messages as to let him know that they wouldn't be able to go with the plans he had already made, let alone actually ask him to come with her to wherever she planned on going later on.", "I tried but she wasn't answering my texts or calls and didn't want to be pushy. She could have invited me during lunch before she made bar plans but she didn't", "Um he did try and reach out several times and she didn't answer.

You let them know, they declined, that's it. They all knew and made these plans anyway. You are NTA, the friends and your gf are", "For what's it's worth, I would have made the same decision. No other SOs were there. If SHE wanted you there, SHE should have invited you.", "I disagree with your first statement. According to OP, her friends didn't tell him because they were concerned that he might give away the surprise. That sounds more plausible than simply assuming her friends didn't want him there at all. \n\nNevertheless, OP, for one reason or another, opted not to go to the party. This action led Cora to feeling slighted as evidenced by her behavior to the OP. Whether or not this feeling of being slighted is justified is largely irrelevant. \n\nWe could rightly argue that *technically* the OP doesn't owe Cora an apology. But feelings don't often hinge on technicalities. Right or wrong, OPs actions resulted in Cora's feelings being hurt, likely due to his absence as well as her probably having to make excuses to her friends as to why he didn't show up. She lost some face. On her birthday.\n\nCora is upset and she isn't necessarily 100% wrong here. And OP isn't 100% right, either. \n\nAnd so we are left with the dilemma of how to repair this situation.\n\nTherefore, OP should simply apologize for missing the party (no admission of guilt or wrongdoing here, simply restating known fact) and offer to make it up to her. By doing this, Cora's bruised ego gets some measure of solace and as a bonus, she gets a second birthday party alone with OP, which is what OP wanted in the first place. \n\nEverybody wins.", "So what? It would\u2019ve been important to Cora if you were there", "I don\u2019t think he deserves an ESH too. How was this any of his fault? He made plans. He let her know he made plans just not what they were. He even asked the friends if they wanted to join in. All his texts and calls went unanswered. The GF couldn\u2019t bother to pick up her phone to let OP know that they wouldn\u2019t be able to go ahead with his plans, let alone actually invite him. Her friends didn\u2019t invite him either, they only invited him when he called to check in on Cora which was definitely an afterthought. \n\n\nIf the gf wanted him there, she should have invited him or at the very least let him actually know that she wouldn\u2019t be able to continue with his plans. Gf was being way too unreasonable here.", "She didn\u2019t KNOW. He said he was keeping it a surprise", "I feel like if it was that important to her, she could have asked me after lunch and I would have rescheduled, that's all", "He had no way of knowing it was important to Cora because she didn\u2019t invite him! She knew he\u2019d made plans for the evening and she prioritized her friends. If she had wanted him there she could have said, \u201cI\u2019d really like a big group celebration with my friends\u201d when he told her he had planned something. She just left him dangling as a backup in case her friends didn\u2019t come through.\n\nThis is a clear NTA.", "She knew he\u2019d made plans.", "She knew I had evening plans for her specifically and stretched her plans with her friends over into evening time.

If she really wanted you there she should have asked right away, and not only once she remembered you exist.", "Hmm. \n\nI understand that your intentions were good - you wanted to take her out for a lovely birthday meal, to a restaurant she was excited about, and for it to be a surprise. That sounds very thoughtful. \n\nThe way you phrased it - \"I asked her not to make any plans for her birthday\" - is nagging at me, though. If someone had said that to me, I might have felt annoyed. What if she'd wanted to make her own plans for her birthday? \n\nI think ESH. You could have asked her, before booking anything, \"Hey, do you have any plans for your birthday evening?\" That would have left room for her to reply with her own plans.\n\nEqually, she could have told you that, actually, she already had plans for her birthday, and then you could've rearranged dinner for a few days later or whatever. Instead, she didn't communicate with you at all about her plans, and left you wondering what was going on.\n\nBad communication all round.", "NTA. You did something thoughtful and she and her friends were thoughtless.", "NTA ..they did not want you there..and neither did she", "I mean, if she doesn't want to celebrate her birthday with her bf, then what's the point of being in a relationship?  \n\nLike, you are a couple for many reasons and ditching you like that is quite a statement. You literary mean less to her than you thought.\n\nShe treated you like a FWB.\nNTA", "She doesn't have a leg to stand on here. She knew you had made plans, ignored them to spend time with her friends, then got mad at you for some crazy reason. She sounds toxic and like a manipulater", "NTA. She knew you made plans for her bd. She chose to make other plans.", "NTA - You've been with her for years and yet her friends thought it was perfectly fine to plan a special occasion without you. And she went along with it all, with no thoughts or consideration for the guy she is dating, and even went so far as to ignore texts? Then tries to blame YOU for it??\n\nI'd be taking a closer look at if I want to continue a relationship with someone that prioritized her friends that much. or allowed them that much control. or thought it was okay to have friends that locked you out of your own GF's celebration after literal years of dating. She's 25, not 16. It's time to  grow up and decide if she is in a relationship or if she is a teeny bopper following her friends around.\n\nYou know you can be with an actual adult that loves and prioritizes you right?", "NTA.\nI think her friends don't like\\hate you.", "NTA  The only reason you were invited was because you tracked her down. She only got mad at you to throw you off because by saying she wanted to spend it with all of you was to keep you from getting mad at her because she was already aware that you made plans for it. She manipulated you.", "Nta. Grow a pair.", "NTA. This seems off.", "I don't think there's any ambiguity/leaving things out here.

She's putting her friends over you, wasting your time and aware that you're sitting at home, waiting.\n\nThe friends sound awful and immature, is your gf normally this insensitive to you, your plans and time? The only time I'd blow off my SO like this is for a bff that's interstate, and even then, I'd be communicating with my SO and apologizing properly.\n\nDo you really want a life where you're an afterthought and then made to believe that you're the problem? Granted, this is a tiny event in your relationship, but is it an isolated event or a frequent occurrence? Would you want someone you care about be treated the way you currently are?", "Yeah I kind of wonder if something happened earlier in the day that OP either glossed over or didn\u2019t realize upset her- like if she was expecting some birthday celebration in the morning and was hurt and so left without saying anything thinking he was ignoring her birthday and her friends jumped in.", "Even if you did not communicate with her friends about your plans, her friends are thick-headed that they made plans for her to spend the whole afternoon and night, knowing that she has a BF who logically could have arranged something as well for his GF because, well, he's her BF.

You seem to put a lot of thought and effort into this relationship and seem to accommodate her perhaps too much. She's mad you didn't read her mind?

He says he \"obviously\" stated to have \"evening plans\" but also that he \"had been hinting\" it. What did he actually say? Maybe his gf thought about some late night cinema? We don't know how long the friends wanted to spend time with her, maybe she thought that both events could go together as the friends' celebration started already with a \"lunch\"?\n\nI'm not defending Cora here, she is certainly at fault about not communicating where she went and when she intended to return but that's the problem with surprises: if nobody expects them they may not be here for them.", "No, he specifically said to keep the night free because he had plans for them.

I just was pointing out that even if the person I responded to considers him as an asshole ( which I don\u2019t) she can\u2019t deny the assholish behavior of Cora.", "My bad, he didn\u2019t include that in the actual post.", "Ah, I think you refer to this post of the OP in the comments:\n\n\"She did, she apologised for not making our plans but she said she didn't want to apologise for spending time with her friends and that I should have been there anyway\"\n\nThat was not in the original story. Yup, Cora's the AH. If he had not called her friends he wouldn't even have known that there was a party going on.", "Yes, he did. Right before he talked about hinting. The full section says:\n\n>A week out, I asked her not to make any plans for her birthday obviously stating that I had made evening plans for us (dinner at this restaurant she's been talking about for ages, dessert and then a drive to go stargazing). I had been hinting around it all week to Cora.\n\nFrom that, my understanding is that he told her he had plans immediately, and then gave her some hints about what the plans would be.", "That text is copied from the post. It\u2019s literally the third sentence. So yes, your bad.", "Reread it, you\u2019re right, my brain decided to miss that part lol", "i already said it was my bad? you don\u2019t need to repeat lol"]}
