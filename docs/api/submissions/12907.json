They told me at the time they had \"not figured anything out yet\" so I assumed they weren't doing anything and then made my plans. \n\nThe day of Cora's birthday comes and she leaves in the afternoon. I thought no big deal, she was probably having some birthday time to herself. She hadn't posted on her story or anything so I didn't think anything of it. 6pm rolls around, I'd messaged and called her and still nothing so I checked her location because she normally replies very quick (we have each others for safety reasons) and she was at one of her friends houses. So I asked her friend if she'd seen my girlfriend because I had a birthday surprise set up for her. \n\nTurns out that her friends did make plans for her birthday and didn\u2019t tell me because they thought I would \"ruin the surprise\" and \"wanted it to be a complete secret\" They had lunch and then made more plans to go out to some bars and celebrate. They then invited me but I declined out of politeness and not wanting to crash their plans since she sees her friends rarely outside of work. I messaged Cora to have a good night with her friends and I'll see her when I get home (I had a cake waiting for her and thought nothing of it and hung with a couple of my friends).\n\nCora came home and was angry I turned down her friends invitation and she wanted to see me with all of her friends on her birthday too. I said it wasn't a big deal and that I saw her in the morning and when she got home anyway.

Either you're leaving something out or your gf is being totally unreasonable. If she wanted to spend her birthday with you, she made no effort to make that happen. NTA", "NTA. Both Cora and her friends knew you had something planned that evening. Seems wild that the friends would plan something that bled into night time or that Cora didn't mention at any point that you had told her to keep that night free?

She was acting angry cause she was caught being the a hole along with her friends and felt guilty for blowing you off. Talk about gaslighting.", "This is tough. You say you told her not to make plans as you had obviously made plans for the evening. Her then ignoring those plans and not saying anything to you is pretty annoying. You also asked her friends. Again, sounds like they knew you made plans (but maybe you just asked and never confirmed with them you did in fact lock something in). \n\nThe friends put you in a bad spot by making plans and leaving you out of them so the plans weren\u2019t ruined. Your girl also knew you had plans and chose her friends plans over a night with you. The invite does sound like an afterthought. \n\nI\u2019m gonna go with NTA on this. I\u2019m assuming your communication was on point and everyone was aware of your birthday plans.", "NTA. She ghosted you on her birthday, then got pissed when you turned down a last-minute invite from one of her friends. If she really wanted you there, she would have responded to your attempts to contact her.", "NTA\nShe was very inconsiderate of the fact that you made plans", "NTA\n\nYou repeatedly let her know you had plans for her birthday. The entire day she couldn't send  you one text regarding what her plans were and actually asked you herself to join in?\n\nIt is bad enough she didn't let you know that you both might have to cancel the plans you had made for her, but she also gets mad at you for declining an offer that was definitely an afterthought?\n\nShe sounds like a piece of work. Her friends deliberately didn't tell you about their plans, and only invited you when you called to check in on your girlfriend because she couldn't bother to pick up a call or answer a text.", "NTA\n\nThey did not tell you because you were not invited.  Then the day of your GF goes off with her friends and does not think to contact you, so you were not her concern.  She has shown you where you rate, so listen.", "NTA.\n\nI could fault you for lacking in communication - with your plans, you should have asked her to be ready to go by (whatever time), even if you didn't want to tell her the specific plans. \n\nBut that doesn't even come close to the complete lack of communication from Cora and her friends. Cora ditched you on her birthday (which I wouldn't necessarily fault her for if you hadn't said you had plans, she has a right to decide), and completely failed to communicate with you. Her friends are full of crap when they say why they didn't invite you - you were not invited, period. The offer to join them was clearly an afterthought.\n\nThe idea that Cora is angry with you is complete bullshit. If you were at all important to her, she would have at least told you when and where she was going and when she'd be back.\n\nSounds like she and her friends are trying to torpedo your relationship.", "NTA - I can understand how she might have become overwhelmed with a birthday surprise and forgotten you made plans. \n\nThe friends, however, suck.

Considering the occasion, it\u2019s obvious that you want to make plans for her and that\u2019s why you were asking. I\u2019d be really upset if this happened to me.", "NTA. Her friends lied to you, your GF didn\u2019t answer your calls and text. You were only invited after you reached out to one of her friends. You were definitely an afterthought. \n\nThe only way I could see your GF being reasonable is if she thought you asked about plans as a way to help her friends plan the \u201csurprise\u201d. \n\nMaybe she did ask about you, and they claimed they invited you and you never showed up.\n\nEdit: typo *didn\u2019t answer", "NTA, this was kinda a tough call but in the end you were never informed of what was going on and weren't invited until you probed her friends as to what was happening.

Terrible communication on Cora's and her friends side. It's overall weird to me that she just left without saying what's she going to do, don't you usually talk about such things?

You were not even invited. That you were invited after you called just looks like an afterthought as it would be pretty rude to tell you that there's a party going on for your gf and still not ask you to join.\n\nBut overall pretty bad communication from everybody involved. If you wanted to invite her to dinner you should have told her that you want to treat her on her birthday and that she should be available for the evening. You also should not have assumed that her friends telling you \"not having figured anything out yet\" means \"we totally have no plans at all\". Your gf should have told you that there's party for her at least as soon as she learned about it. And her friends should either have trusted you with being able to keep the secrect or surprise-invited you at the same as her.\n\nAll this sounds to me that there is more behind the surface of this botched birthday celebration.", "There was a weirdly similar situation on here with almost identical wording on the part about asking the friends except in that one the guy only hinted he might have plans by asking his gf\n\nRegardless it does change the situation to NTA if you've clearly told her you have evening plans which will be a surprise and she's ignored it", "This right here. OP told the friends you made plans. OP told Cora you made plans. Neither the friends nor Cora could be bothered to remember that?\n\nNTA OP. But, it sounds like there needs to be a discussion about communication expectations going forward, or this relationship is not going to last.", "Maybe that was my mistake not fully confirming the times of things with her friends? But yeah they knew I had some sort of evening plans and their bar plans were to go out all night", "I just let her know I would reschedule to celebrate another day and told her to have fun with her friends, I didn't let her know what I'd planned so it could still be somewhat of a surprise", "That's what I was thinking. None of the other partners of her friends were with them either so I thought it was better I let her enjoy herself and to stay behind", "Thats what I thought? \n\n\nI usually tell my partner if I am going out with someone. Or discuss my plans. I thought it was weird too that she just left without saying anything.", "She did, I asked her a week ago if she was busy on her birthday. Throughout the week I hinted, things like \"I hope you're excited for your birthday, I've got something cool planned in the evening\" I didn't explicitly say what it was but I made sure she knew something was being planned for us in the evening. Had I known her friends also wanted to do something, I would have worked it out with them", "She did, she apologised for not making our plans but she said she didn't want to apologise for spending time with her friends and that I should have been there anyway because I could still see her for the evening like I planned anyway.

I get it, she doesn't see her friends a lot due to work and other plans we make but still", "Yeah, I'm definitely going to reschedule and tell her we have concrete dinner plans with a time whenever I can find a day that works for us. It's just a shame, I know she would have loved it had we gone on her birthday", "Why. Her friends obviously didn\u2019t want him there, and that\u2019s not his fault. He didn\u2019t get an invite until *after* he started calling/texting looking for her.\nHe could absolutely say \u201chey, since we didn\u2019t get to do my plans on your birthday, how about next Saturday?\u201d, but he shouldn\u2019t have to apologize for her friends excluding him.", "In the morning? I made her breakfast and gave her a card wishing happy birthday", "So Cora should have invited him. But she didn't, did she?\n\nOP was invited by Cora's friend, that too was not an effort that was made by the friend. He was invited, when he called to check in on Cora. Definitely an afterthought and definitely not invited because he was wanted there. \n\nAt no point did Cora pick up her phone and answer OP's calls or messages as to let him know that they wouldn't be able to go with the plans he had already made, let alone actually ask him to come with her to wherever she planned on going later on.", "I tried but she wasn't answering my texts or calls and didn't want to be pushy. She could have invited me during lunch before she made bar plans but she didn't", "Um he did try and reach out several times and she didn't answer.

I don\u2019t think he\u2019s an asshole,  but at the very least you should have said ESH.", "No, you don't have to let her friends know you did indeed make plans for your gf on her birthday after asking them if they want to join you two. You let them know, they declined, that's it. They all knew and made these plans anyway. You are NTA, the friends and your gf are", "For what's it's worth, I would have made the same decision. No other SOs were there. If SHE wanted you there, SHE should have invited you.", "I disagree with your first statement. According to OP, her friends didn't tell him because they were concerned that he might give away the surprise. That sounds more plausible than simply assuming her friends didn't want him there at all. \n\nNevertheless, OP, for one reason or another, opted not to go to the party. This action led Cora to feeling slighted as evidenced by her behavior to the OP. Whether or not this feeling of being slighted is justified is largely irrelevant. \n\nWe could rightly argue that *technically* the OP doesn't owe Cora an apology. But feelings don't often hinge on technicalities. Right or wrong, OPs actions resulted in Cora's feelings being hurt, likely due to his absence as well as her probably having to make excuses to her friends as to why he didn't show up. She lost some face. On her birthday.\n\nCora is upset and she isn't necessarily 100% wrong here. And OP isn't 100% right, either. \n\nAnd so we are left with the dilemma of how to repair this situation.\n\nTherefore, OP should simply apologize for missing the party (no admission of guilt or wrongdoing here, simply restating known fact) and offer to make it up to her. By doing this, Cora's bruised ego gets some measure of solace and as a bonus, she gets a second birthday party alone with OP, which is what OP wanted in the first place. \n\nEverybody wins.", "So what? It would\u2019ve been important to Cora if you were there", "I don\u2019t think he deserves an ESH too. How was this any of his fault? He made plans. He let her know he made plans just not what they were. He even asked the friends if they wanted to join in. All his texts and calls went unanswered. The GF couldn\u2019t bother to pick up her phone to let OP know that they wouldn\u2019t be able to go ahead with his plans, let alone actually invite him. Her friends didn\u2019t invite him either, they only invited him when he called to check in on Cora which was definitely an afterthought. \n\n\nIf the gf wanted him there, she should have invited him or at the very least let him actually know that she wouldn\u2019t be able to continue with his plans. Gf was being way too unreasonable here.", "She didn\u2019t KNOW. He said he was keeping it a surprise", "I feel like if it was that important to her, she could have asked me after lunch and I would have rescheduled, that's all", "He had no way of knowing it was important to Cora because she didn\u2019t invite him!

If she had wanted him there she could have said, \u201cI\u2019d really like a big group celebration with my friends\u201d when he told her he had planned something.

If she really wanted you there she should have asked right away, and not only once she remembered you exist.", "Hmm. \n\nI understand that your intentions were good - you wanted to take her out for a lovely birthday meal, to a restaurant she was excited about, and for it to be a surprise. That sounds very thoughtful. \n\nThe way you phrased it - \"I asked her not to make any plans for her birthday\" - is nagging at me, though. If someone had said that to me, I might have felt annoyed. What if she'd wanted to make her own plans for her birthday? \n\n You could have asked her, before booking anything, \"Hey, do you have any plans for your birthday evening?\" That would have left room for her to reply with her own plans.\n\nEqually, she could have told you that, actually, she already had plans for her birthday, and then you could've rearranged dinner for a few days later or whatever. Instead, she didn't communicate with you at all about her plans, and left you wondering what was going on.\n\nBad communication all round.\n\n(edit) NTA - OP clarified in replies", "NTA. You did something thoughtful and she and her friends were thoughtless.", "NTA ..they did not want you there..and neither did she", "I mean, if she doesn't want to celebrate her birthday with her bf, then what's the point of being in a relationship?  \n\nLike, you are a couple for many reasons and ditching you like that is quite a statement. You literary mean less to her than you thought.\n\nShe treated you like a FWB.\nNTA", "She doesn't have a leg to stand on here. She knew you had made plans, ignored them to spend time with her friends, then got mad at you for some crazy reason. She sounds toxic and like a manipulater", "NTA. She knew you made plans for her bd. She chose to make other plans.", "NTA - You've been with her for years and yet her friends thought it was perfectly fine to plan a special occasion without you. And she went along with it all, with no thoughts or consideration for the guy she is dating, and even went so far as to ignore texts? Then tries to blame YOU for it??\n\nI'd be taking a closer look at if I want to continue a relationship with someone that prioritized her friends that much. or allowed them that much control. or thought it was okay to have friends that locked you out of your own GF's celebration after literal years of dating. She's 25, not 16. It's time to  grow up and decide if she is in a relationship or if she is a teeny bopper following her friends around.\n\nYou know you can be with an actual adult that loves and prioritizes you right?", "NTA.\nI think her friends don't like\\hate you.", "NTA  The only reason you were invited was because you tracked her down.

The only time I'd blow off my SO like this is for a bff that's interstate, and even then, I'd be communicating with my SO and apologizing properly.\n\nDo you really want a life where you're an afterthought and then made to believe that you're the problem? Granted, this is a tiny event in your relationship, but is it an isolated event or a frequent occurrence? Would you want someone you care about be treated the way you currently are?", "Yeah I kind of wonder if something happened earlier in the day that OP either glossed over or didn\u2019t realize upset her- like if she was expecting some birthday celebration in the morning and was hurt and so left without saying anything thinking he was ignoring her birthday and her friends jumped in.", "Even if you did not communicate with her friends about your plans, her friends are thick-headed that they made plans for her to spend the whole afternoon and night, knowing that she has a BF who logically could have arranged something as well for his GF because, well, he's her BF.

We don't know how long the friends wanted to spend time with her, maybe she thought that both events could go together as the friends' celebration started already with a \"lunch\"?\n\nI'm not defending Cora here, she is certainly at fault about not communicating where she went and when she intended to return but that's the problem with surprises: if nobody expects them they may not be here for them.", "No, he specifically said to keep the night free because he had plans for them.

I would be mad at the friends for excluding me and not inviting me. A jelous person would assume something fishy is going on. Me? I would be mad that after the surprise wore off, she didn't tell me or invite me. That would be a polite conversation about boundaries because, to me, a partner shouldn't go AWOL when they know you planned something. It's disrespectful. The icing on the cake and the point she f'ed up and went into ex territory is when she did not ask her friends where you were, why you were not there, and call you. \n\nIf I got a surprise party, I would thank everyone, smile, have a little fun, and ask where my significant other way. Either because A. They were not invited, and it is insulting to them and me. Or B, they knew and decided not to come. My friends know I am best friends with my partner and she makes me happy. I want her around. Fun birthday requires her. If they were not invited, I would step outside, call her, and fill her in and ask what she wanted to do with her plans and insist I be home by the time for her plans. That's basic respect. \n\nA hypothetical here, let's say you planned to cook dinner. A romantic dinner. Something I did. I was excited as hell and made it known I had a surprise and told my partner what she should wear so we could do everything. What I planned was a YUUUGGGEEE charcuterie board, rose petals, two types of appropriate wine pairings (each chilled to perfect temperature when eating would begin), I learned how to give massages and bought even spa towels to give a massage. It was over 1,000 in cost and hours of work to get everything ready. Took hours to pull off. My partner knew I was excited. But she didn't know what I had planned. \n\nIf she flaked, had something come up, etc. I wouldn't be happy. But if she communicated, I would suck it up and figure it out. I would replan and respend the money if needed. If she came home later and had the audacity to be mad at me, I would be furious. I would attempt a conversation without anger but if she continued to be mad, I would accept we would not work out. I would not express anger and she would no longer be worth my energy.\n\nFor all your soon to be ex knew you could have been proposing. \n\nAnother thing.

You were set up to fail.", "Hey at least you know what its like to be an after thought", "NTA\n\nCora and her friends completely disregarded the plans that they knew you had for the evening. Then, she didn't pick up her phone or respond to your texts. Finally, when you found out what was going on, you then got an invitation, only because you found out. Otherwise, you wouldn't have been invited.\n\nThat is shitty behaviour from all of them, and even worse that Cora got angry at you.", "I have a feeling she might have felt guilty but her friends convinced her you were at fault. They wouldnt have invited you if you didnt call around to get in contact. The fact that shes pretending you were legit invited is so delusional lol hopefully she was just drunk and listened to some crap advice", "Nta. She is. She knew you made plans.", "This just doesn't even seem real.....but if it happened, knowing that you had made plans to do something with her then dump her..... NTA but she is!!", "NTA.  You had made plans to celebrate and she knew.  She chose her friends plans over yours.  I would have taken the cake with me and got rid of any presents.

If anything , you\u2019re the one who deserves to be hurt and angry, not her. And her friends were rude knowing you had prior plans.  I\u2019d find someone more thoughtful and respectful to you than her. She and her friends were only thinking of themselves. Very selfish.", "NTA. Significant others have first right of refusal for making plans for birthdays and other life events. ONLY if thr SO isn't making plans, do friends get to make all-day plans without including the SO. also your gf is TA for not communicating with you all day or answering your calls knowing you might have made plans.", "NTA.", "NTA why are her friends so shitty to you?", "NTA. You told her you had something planned for her birthday, yet she still chose to celebrate with her friends, plans and your feelings be damned, and only called/invited you after you contacted her friend.

It\u2019s really important to me that you feel appreciated and loved. I planned a beautiful night together because I wanted to make sure you felt special and I wanted to share that moment with you. Later realizing that you were spending it with friends and I wasn\u2019t let in on it, that hurt because I wasn\u2019t let in on what was happening and felt like I could be apart of it. That\u2019s not your fault, but it\u2019s important that your friends communicate with your partner that they are going to plan a day for you instead. I felt isolated from the celebration and I didn\u2019t feel like I should join you guys. I understand you feel angry that I wasn\u2019t there, I think we\u2019re both upset by the situation. I\u2019d love to do a redo of our night together to celebrate you. Let\u2019s communicate soon with your friends where the group of us can understand for the future how Birthday planning should be organized, so no one feels left out and everyone can enjoy your birthday, especially you. \n\nAll honestly, this probably happened because she\u2019s young. People still suck at that age for thinking thoughtfully of others. This stuff doesn\u2019t happen in your 30s. I don\u2019t even think late 20s.", "NTA. You're not even upset about the whole thing, which shows a lot of maturity from your part. On top of that she's gaslighting you.\n\nI can smell the toxic fumes from here. Dump her.", "So she heard you state you had plans for her birthday, proceeds to prioritize her friends plans over yours without telling you, effectively ghosts you, invites you out of a pity afterthought to spend time with her and her friends knowing you made these plans, and then gets mad at you for saying no to that? The red flags just keep piling on and on here. It\u2019s time to do better OP\n\nNTA", "NTA\u2026sounds like she\u2019s sabotaging to make you the bad guy and end the relationship. You should oblige.

And honestly maybe she wanted to spend her birthday with her friends. She invited you and you decided to be petty and send a passive aggressive \"hope you have fun with your friends..\" text. \n\nNext time ask her what she wants to do.", "Weren\u2019t the friends keeping their plans a secret from OP to not ruin the surprise?", "NTA. I would honestly consider dumping her for this, not gonna lie. I'd be very hurt.", "And now she is mad.

She has rescheduled things before for friends being in town unexpectedly but she normally will tell me. I'm not sure why she didn't message or call me at least once between lunch and when I asked her girl friend if she was alright", "Yeah I guess I could have been more concrete. Whenever we have evening plans, they're generally around 7 and I booked the restaurant for 8 just to factor in any unexpected events she had during the day like if she went to visit her mum or something", "I was thinking this too!\n\nToo many things were vague.

They're 2 things she's wanted to do for ages. I would be so excited", "I think it\u2019s likely the lunch was supposed to be a surprise, but once they were there, GF was informed for the plans for the rest of the day and for whatever reason, felt the need not to tell/invite OP. Not saying that makes it right at all, I just don\u2019t think the surprise element was a total lie.", "I\u2019ve never had a girlfriend not feel excited to make me part of her birthday plans.  Sounds like she didn\u2019t want you there and is gaslighting you to make it your fault.

That's a hard no from me.", "This needs reply needs to be higher up", "He literally took the initiative and geared a surprise evening to her specific interests and let her know he had something in mind. Reached out to her friends for planning. This is what every person on here bitching about an inconsiderate partner is asking for. If Cora was annoyed at that, well, OP should just run for that alone, but at minimum if she had something she wanted to do she should have voiced it, and CERTAINLY not ignored OP the entire day he was trying to reach her. This feels like OP was set up to fail in every way, intentionally.", "I bet it's more like the friends told the GF that they HAD invited the BF but not WHEN and so for the GF, she's all \"why wouldn't you come?\" and may have even, in her head, conflated the \"his plans\" with \"their plans\". \n\nThat's a possibility to be explored if this is unusual behavior from the GF.", "She ghosted you and is gaslighting you now.", "One thing I'll say that's a bit of a red flag is the fact that the friends made the excuse that they didn't want you to know about it in case you would ruin the surprise, while you had your own surprise going on that your gf, and hence her friends, knew about. Kinda makes me think that while there was a communication breakdown for sure at least between you and her friends, you were almost certainly lied to by your gf and the posse. They had this planned and are using the excuse of saying it was a surprise to leave you out of it. It's one thing if they would've talked to you about it, but they clearly didn't want to. \n\nI understand you're just going with the flow, but there's a weird, unnecessary game that's being played. So if I were you, I would just be super logical and say \"Look, I was under the impression we were hanging out. I DID have plans for your birthday night. You went out with your friends, basically ghosted me until you wanted me around, and now you're playing the guilt card when I'm not really raising hell over being the one left out. I don't even have a problem that yall wanted to spend your day together. I was just giving you your space with your friends since it seemed as if you didn't want to do our thing that night. I'm sorry if you're hurt, but quite frankly, you ghosted me until yall wanted me around and didn't even tell me you didn't want to go on our date together. Seems kinda unfair to frame this otherwise.\"", "No.  Just no.  If she had really wanted you there, she would have called you as soon as she got to the surprise party to get you to come over immediately.  Instead, you had to chase her down.  Please see this as it really is:  She\u2019s just not that into you.  NTA", "Why is all this complete lack of any consideration for you and your plans totally fine to you? I dont get it", "Thats good then. See it a lot on here. Still NTA tho. Think you need to tell her what you had planned and explain it all from your side. The prior communication with her friends and all that. Sounds like you two will be fine then.", "Your gf is cheating on you. Her girl friend let her use her place with her side piece. That's why she was not answering your texts and calls.\n\nDump her.", "Not really. People have come to this kind of realization on this sub several times. If OP looks back and this isnt' the case no biggie. Somehow I bet its a repeating pattern tho. Sometimes you need that extra push to notice.", "You're being too understanding. She was thoughtless, dismissive and hurtful to you, and her friends blatantly lied to you then gave you a pity invite. If anyone has reason to be mad it's you, not your gf.", "No way thats a valid excuse. Would you ever \u201caccidentally\u201d forget about your GF on your birthday?", "Okay, then NTA. I think if you were descriptive about the special evening you were setting up and explicitly invited them, they may have backed off their plans. They may have perceived it as, \u201che\u2019s only doing something because we\u2019re not,\u201d so they may not have completely realized. Just playing devil\u2019s advocate. All in all, I don\u2019t think this is THAT big of a deal. I don\u2019t think you need to re-evaluate your relationship like a lot of folks are saying in the comments. Surprise birthday stuff can get tricky. Hats off you for trying, maybe just apologize and explain to Cora. But nothing to really ruminate about.", "Ah ok fair play that's fine then. Changed my verdict.", "Totally not taking her side, because she should\u2019ve texted you once her friends\u2019 surprise was revealed. \n\nBut if I were her, I would\u2019ve asked about a specific time. \u201cEvening\u201d can mean \u201cbe ready by 4pm\u201d, or \u201cbe ready by 7pm\u201d. That would determine my entire day. \n\nIt sucks that you wanted to do something sweet for her and she got caught up with her friends.", "Ah right, yeah that makes more sense. Absolutely NTA then. She was acting like an asshole.", "Personally, if someone took me stargazing I would be over the moon (no pun intended) that they know my likes enough to plan something like that.", "Its completely subjective", "Dinner with just you instead of going out with all of her friends? Yeah, that's pretty boring. That's anniversary or Valentine's Day type plans, not 25th birthday.", "I'm so glad someone made this point because these are the thoughts I had right away. I would never make birthday plans WITHOUT my bf. I would do everything in my power to include him.", "It's not fine, I am annoyed about it because I know she would have loved it. At the end of the day, she went to some bars which she could of gone to one of the restaurants on her list and stargazing which is her loss. I just want to properly talk it out", "Idk, the purpose is to judge whether or not him choosing not to go the party is an AH move. Not tell the guy to re evaluate his relationship. But fair enough, agree to disagree.", "I am annoyed don't get me wrong, this would have been a great birthday for her so she missed out. I'm just trying to let her calm down a bit before we can properly talk it out", "I would like to think so. We normally surprise each other, talk/message every day, we go on dates which we both plan. I don't think we're a one-sides couple if that makes sense", "I think the problem here is, if someone told me not to make plans, they have a surprise for me\u2026then I\u2019m staying by their side until said plans go off and if I do need to do something, for whatever reason, I will let that person know so that can plan accordingly. I don\u2019t have to now the exact plan to know that I need to keep my schedule clear, that\u2019s what I\u2019m focusing\n\nCora not only decided to leave, she gave no indication of where she was, or what she was doing, or how long she\u2019d be until OP reached out to her friends. And then, and only then, did someone go, \u201cOh, we meant to invite you too.\u201d And Cora never mentioned it again until she came home. If she wanted him to be there so badly, if the party truly was a surprise, why did she not call/text herself? That\u2019s why I\u2019m leaning towards full AH for Cora and her group. \n\nWe can agree to disagree, not here to argue or cause commotion, just my point of view. I just personally feel like Cora had enough information to be able to properly communicate. And the moment she was pulled into  another event, if she were truly unaware of it, she should have reached out. Ghosting your partner and then getting mad seems weird. What if OP never texted her friends to try and figure out where she was? Then he would have never gotten the invite, based on the way the story played out.", "I said that she should keep her evening open, not the day because I thought she might want some alone time or to do other things", "Yeah, I probably should have been clearer with her friends. I guess I assumed when her boyfriend says he's going to make plans, they wouldn't intrude on it", "This is why I don\u2019t like surprises. \n\nSOMEONE is going to be upset.", "Fair enough, guessing you're not someone who really likes food", "I like how you keep doubling down on being objectively wrong in your facts.\n\nShe KNEW OP has evening plans for them, she just didn't know what those plans specifically were.", "Yuuuuup", "And he'd have been called the AH if he hadn't made soup because \"Cook for yourself if you don't like what she's making\". This sub is ridiculous sometimes.", "Sometimes people react that way bc they\u2019re afraid of disappointing you though. Not saying it\u2019s ok, but when you told her you\u2019d already made plans she might have just not wanted to hurt your feelings. That\u2019s why you ask someone what they want before deciding for them what they are going to be doing. Some people like surprises but for something like a birthday you also have to keep in mind that they might want to do something else. If you\u2019d had an earlier conversation where you had asked what she wanted and she\u2019d said something like, I\u2019d be down for anything, surprise me, etc. it would make sense. But she also should have communicated that while a romantic dinner is nice, she might want to do something with friends too.", "It wasn't that she isn't allowed, I just wish she would have messaged me about it first since she knew I was planning something and then I could have cancelled the reservation", "ITs not about whether or not she would love it. It\u2019s about the pure disrespect to you as her partner. There is a 0% chance I would ever do that to my GF", "That's great and sorry. We usually see extremes on here - pushovers and AHs. It's not as common to see a mature, measured person LOL", "That's fair, and lot of my opinion is coming from my own experience being the surprisee recently. Luckily my bf WAS in on the plan.\n\nI legitimately thought I was simply going out for dinner with mom and a few friends and then going to my bf's house for the weekend like I always do. Bf and I had no plans. \n\nSo I went out for dinner. Then, surprise, we're going out dancing and we have one more thing! Then they brought me to where a friend's band was playing, everyone else, bf included, was waiting. I texted bf at the dancing stop to give him the heads up that I'd be coming over later than planned. Again, we didn't have any plans, I just didn't want him to wait up for me.\n\nHowever... If he'd told me to keep the day open, and then my friends told me they had a surprise for me,  I'd be wondering what they all cooked up together. I wouldn't be expecting my friends to have Plan A that my bf didn't know about. \n\nThat's why I'm wondering, once Cora realized she was pulled into a surprise, if she simply assumed he was involved, since he was hinting about plans. \n\nYou're right, he probably wouldn't have been invited had he not called the friend, but if I was Cora I wouldn't have known for sure that he wasn't invited until that 6pm call. \n\nUltimately, I think the friends screwed up the most by not confirming with OP first to see if there were plans, and then not looping him in on theirs.", "Apologies, but I still believe you did your best in communicating that you had something in mind for your partner. That\u2019s enough information, in my opinion, to plan a day accordingly and enough time to communicate if things were changing.", "I get that, and you absolutely aren't the AH here.\n\nBut it's still reasonable for her to think that you and the friends planned something together for the evening.", "That\u2019s a fair assumption to make.", "Nope, I eat cause I'm hungry, not cause I want to.", "I understand what you mean but we generally like to surprise eachother with things big and small. She did for my birthday and I loved it so I decided to also surprise her for hers with things she's wanted to do for ages but has never had the time to do it. If she had asked me further about the surprise, I would have told her but that's what we like doing as a couple", "Yes I agree with that. We generally like to surprise each other for events though so I thought it would be okay and I knew she would be down for what I'd planned once I got the chance to tell her", "Haha it's alright. Some of the comments are a bit much but people mean well", "Yeah my girlfriend loves restaurants and going out to cafes etc, she has a whole list", "She does, she likes throwing them and also being at the receiving end. She surprised me with concert tickets and organised a trip for my birthday when I let her know I had a free weekend a few weeks prior.", "[deleted]", "Or she\u2019s an asshole lol", "[deleted]", "Like other Redditors have suggested, your invite to her friends\u2019 plans really does seem like an afterthought. No one plans a surprise for their friend and doesn\u2019t let their partner know what the plan is either. \n\nNot going as far as to call your GF an asshole - you did ask her to keep her night free but she may have just gotten caught up in the moment of her friends throwing her a surprise and going to a bunch of places. But her friends are major AHs for hijacking your plans and not having the decency of inviting you to be part of it. \n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nYou followed protocol, informed her you made plans, asked her friends if they were making plans because you made plans, and they didn't tell you. She didn't tell them. She just let them get away with lying, upstaging you, and then not inviting you until they were like, \"Oh. Yeah. Forgot you existed. Wanna come?\"\n\nIs this a first time thing, or does she typically brush you off with no warning for her friends?", "You spelled \u201cex-girlfriend\u201d wrong.\n\nShe knew you\u2019d made plans for her birthday. She ignored your messages and calls.

NTA: But time to move on.", "I\u2019m gonna say ~~ESH~~(edited to NTA, though i feel communication could have been better all around). I would be flabbergasted if my friends organized a surprise party and didn\u2019t invite my longtime partner. That\u2019s fucking weird. I assume either they hate you or you\u2019ve proven yourself unable to keep a secret. \n\nAlso confused as to why there was so little communication between you as a couple. You seem to have bailed so easily. Like, why not call her and discuss how she\u2019d prefer to spend the day? Tell her your plans and ask her what she wanted to do? Then she could have a) ditched the friends for you, b) invited you to hang with everyone else, or c) ditched you for the friends. \n\nVery odd behavior from everyone involved.", "NTA the only reason they invited you was because you were able to get ahold of one of the friends.

Definitely NTA", "NTA. You told her you made plans and she blew you off. Her friends lied to you. You did absolutely nothing wrong and she sounds terrible for not admitting that she blew you off.

So I asked her friend if she'd seen my girlfriend because I had a birthday surprise set up for her.\n\nYou text her AND called her and she didnt respond. That was HER opportunity to invite you. She didn't. You had to call her friends,  then her friends tell you whats going on???\n\nIt doesnt really make sense that they would tell Cora about the surprise birthday, but not you. From the context provided it does seem like inviting you was not part of anyones plans and was only an afterthought after you managed to track Cora down even tho she was ignoring you. \n\nNTA. Tell your gf if she wanted you to come she should have invited you instead of ignoring your texts and calls.", "NTA however you should be saying ex girlfriend. Is this the first time you are an afterthought? If not, then she should be an ex since she does not care about you.", "NTA.  I guess your hints were too subtle? Your invitation was absolutely an afterthought, I would have said no too.  She has nothing to feel bad about - she ditched your plans and didn't let you know she planned on staying out with her friends.  You were super considerate to back off and let her have her friends time.  The only response if she mentions it again is \"whatever\".

It's really the fault of her friends for not including OP in the plans, and the fact that they never told him until he asked is either poor communication on her friends, or an intentional act to exclude him. \n\nI think there are a lot of assumptions about HER intention, actions, and assumptions (maybe she thought the party with her friends were part of his plans?), but the only thing we DO know is her friends made a conscious decision to never tell OP what was happening until it was too late.", "I definitely am being charitable. I just don't want to assume too much without more info, but I think you nailed it on the head if I'm having to put money on it. I will add that it just seems like OP and his GF may have two separate friend circles, which is fine, but when it comes to bdays and planning anything, it seems like OP is an afterthought, which is the GF's fault. It becomes her fault when she ghosts him for as long as she did. I'm married now, but when I was dating my wife, or really any other SO, and I pulled something like this, they would break up with me. Not saying that's what OP should do, but it just seems very abnormal that the GF did and then guilts OP the next day.\n\n Makes me wonder how often this kinda situation crops up, too.

You thinking you were perfectly clear does not means she fully understood. If you go into the conversation with an open mind, instead of assuming the worst in her, then you may figure out WHY there was such drastic miscommunication.

Them not inviting spouses is a bit of a flag as the guys can just do their own thing at the bar while the girls have fun. \n\nAs to going where they like, they most certainly can. I merely mentioned it since they are stacking up issues and she is now getting angry at you for no legitimate reason.", "Why don't your feelings matter? Not only did she hurt your feelings by ghosting you when she knew you had plans, but then she gets ANGRY at YOU?  \n\nAre you sure you're not being a doormat here?

I would put in the effort to have a discussion and if she still doesn\u2019t see your side of the issue, then you can do whatever you think is right.", "He is a boyfriend, not husband, not a fianc\u00e9.\nHe assumed he would get priority in her mind.\n\nHe didn't communicate to her friends more than just asking. He assumed.

Honestly, I don't really know them that well. I'm a lot closer to her university friends. I think they probably just wanted a girls night out to celebrate Cora", "Just for the record, at every point I said NTA. I think that her friends were TA towards you and that she should communicate better.\n\nHere I am responding to commenters who seem to think that what she wants for her birthday does not matter at all.", "Of course mine matter but I want to talk things over rationally. She doesn't really throw tantrums, we occasionally bicker but all couples do that.", "Ah okay that would make sense. I've cut a lot of my home friends out of my life because they weren't good for me", "I did not said OP communicated bad, she did.\n\nBut, on her birthday, she should be allowed to prioritize actually fun activity with friends. Especially rare one over vague plan to do something pretty standard.", "That is all about someone assumption what she wants  but not what she wants.\n\nShe did not knew what activity was and had only vague idea. In that situation, going impulsively for party from. friends should be fine. And even if she new, wanting to continue fun party does sound as more for you birthday then going to restaurant. You can go to restaurant any time  it is not like it would not be postponable.\n\nShe should have communicated better. But the whole \"lock evening and skip fun activities because what I want to do, but I won't tell you in advance\" is asking birthday person to prioritize someone else. \n\nWhich is quite  odd, because this sub goes super hard on anyone who forgets. But I would definitely preferred partner to occasionally forget then to guilt me over wanting to continue actually fun rare activity.", "Well, hopefully, you can resolve the issue soon.

I'm saying she's acting like OP doesn't matter.\n\nThere's a difference.\n\nIf this is a once off, things can improve. If it's habitual, things won't. Only OP can answer that, and I hope for them that it's not the latter.\n\nOp, please be objective when you look back at your relationship.

The fact is OP told her and her friends he had something planned and to keep that night free. If she didnt want that to happen/wanted to know what the plans were, that was the time to say something. Same with the friends, who knew exactly what they were doing. \n\nThe way this played out was very disrespectful to the OP and he definitely needs to have a conversation about the future of their relationship before moving forward.", "My girlfriend is a foodie and this restaurant is something she's wanted to visit for a long time but has never had the chance. The stargazing is also something she talked about when we first met but she's never met anyone who was wanting to do that with her. I know my girlfriend and what she likes and she always trusts me with surprises and date nights because of that so my birthday plans were always going to be something she wanted. \n\nWhen I learned she would have rather caught up with her friends, I decided to step back and let her enjoy. I wasn't asking her to prioritise me, just rather that she would have told me when she found out instead of going NC with me for the night", "You\u2019re missing the point. OP didn\u2019t get mad at her for skipping out on plans she had committed to and not communicating what she wanted to do on her birthday because he understood exactly what you\u2019re saying about it being her birthday. Where she is the asshole is because she then comes home mad at him because SHE was unable to clearly communicate what she wanted. Being mad at someone for your own mistake and lack of communication is an asshole move.\n\nAgain, OP is not the asshole because he was trying to plan a sweet night (listened to her gush about this restaurant in the past) and when plans for it fell through because she didn\u2019t communicate what she wanted and decided to do something else, he accepted that and adjusted to still try to give her good birthday by being there for her when she returned from her plans with a cake waiting for her. The only thing OP did was decline to attend plans that were conveyed to him VERY last minute and that doesn\u2019t make someone an asshole. OPs girlfriend\u2019s friends could have told him of the plans earlier on in the day or the girlfriend could have told him she wanted him there for the last minute plans if at all possible because it\u2019s what she wants on her birthday. But they didn\u2019t. They simply invited him last minute and he declined.", "Okay so from my point of view: I don't think she could have mistaken what I meant because I clearly made plans for a romantic evening birthday plans. I didn't give her a time but we always set off from plans from home together, as we did my previous 2 birthdays and her last one. She didn't text or call me asking if anything had changed so I figured she knew she was meant to be at home during the evening. She  never let me know she had plans with friends or where she was so doesn't that mean she blew me off (even if she did forget). In the morning I was saying how excited I was for the evening so she did have a reminder", "I managed to cancel the reservation when it was clear Cora wanted to stay with her friends so I think i'm okay on that front", "How did he claim her birthday? He asked her friends, and they didn't respond with anything, and she agreed to it. It's her SO, if you don't want to celebrate your birthday with your SO, then you shouldn't be in a relationship with that person.", "It's not 'claiming' a birthday. If my partner went through the effort of organising something and said to turn up in the evening, I would do him the bare minimum of checking in and asking what times plan start. You know, because I love and respect him, and he's my partner??? \n\nAnd I trust that he would pick something I would like to do. If I didn't like some aspect of it, I'd just suck it up. Because I'm an adult, I get to spend time with a loved one who's gone out of their way to thoughtfully organise something for me (in this case a restaurant she's been wanting to go to for a while) and my birthday doesn't mean that I'm queen of the world.", "> What is rare about going out to lunch and then bar hopping? Nothing super special about that,\n\nIt actually is? I have never done that all that often. It is actually fun thing to do and a thing you do very rarely. Unless you are alcoholic. Plus, parties that evolve spontaneously are always the best.\n\nI mean, realistically alternative was going to the restaurant which is something you really can do the next day or next week, whenever.\n\nNot telling OP was disrespectful. But expectation to give up and leave ongoing party activities and just stop celebration is ... giving up good birthdays foe someone else. She can do it, but it is not about gift for her.", "I'm just trying to help you salvage your relationship. If you want to \"be right\" in this argument you may be sacrificing your relationship, so it's up to you which you really want. I do not think you are an AH in your frustration, I just think you shouldn't be as upset with your gf as you are.\n\nI understand what your perspective is, but you haven't taken the time to consider her perspective. If you hold on to your anger you may end this relationship, and if that's what you want to do then that is your choice. But going into a conversation with nothing but anger and assuming the worst in your partner is not going to lead to a healthy outcome.\n\nI'm going to be blunt with these 2 details from your previous comment:\n\n>I didn't give her a time\n\nYou were not clear with your intentions, and if you don't specifically say what time you are meeting up then you can't be mad when they aren't available. How exactly were you planning on \"starting\" the evening you planned, when you never gave her a time for everything to start?\n\n>She didn't text or call me asking if anything had changed so I figured she knew she was meant to be at home during the evening.\n\nSaying 'evening' is vague, and the definition is typically \"sunset until bedtime\", which is a 3-5 hour window (depending on the person). So your plan was to have her just sitting at home waiting for you to start your plans?? Also, you called her at 6pm, which is barely considered \"evening\", and she could have been planning on meeting up with you when you were ready for your plans to begin.\n\nFor the next time you want to plan a surprise, this is what you do: \"Hi honey. I planned a special surprise for your birthday. On day X we are going somewhere at time Y, and the dress code is casual/fancy. We will then continue doing other stuff throughout the night, so please have that time slot open\"\n\nAgain: I'm trying to give you a perspective you haven't considered, and I'm trying to defend your gf and give her the benefit of the doubt. This is prime \"interpersonal communications class\" territory, and I'm just trying to demonstrate that it's POSSIBLE there was a misunderstanding on her part. If you want to demand an apology because you want to \"be right\", then that's your decision to make. \n\nRelationships are always supposed to be \"US versus the problem\", and not \"Me against you\". Demanding an apology is a \"me against you\" situation.", "That's good. Having worked at a nice restaurant in the past no shows sucked.\n\nRegardless, I'm sorry you're in this situation, I can only try and put myself in your shoes and it doesn't feel good.\n\nBest case scenario imo is that her anger w you is a projection of her being mad at herself.  \n\nWhile I would never do what she did to you, to my SO I'd feel terrible for being out, while she was waiting for me at home. Just typing that out made me feel uncomfortable because it just wouldn't happen. However if I called and asked her to come out because I really wanted to see her and she stayed in to sulk, I may (?) be a bit disgruntled (it was the friends that called though, right?). But again if I really actually wanted to be with her, we'd already be out in the first place.\n\nObviously your relationship is bigger than this snapshot you've given us but it definitely gives me pause. Especially the ignoring calls and texts all while you had already told her to keep the evening open for a romantic night.\n\nI still think you are the one that deserves the apology.", "Depends on age, but yeah lots of people in their 20's do that for birthdays. \n\nAs for being able to do the restaurant next day/week, yeah that is an option, but you could say the exact same thing about going to lunch and and bar hopping. \n\nAt the end of the day, she willingly chose to not spend any time with OP on her birthday. I don't know about you, but i choose to spend my birthdays with friends and family that i love. It's just something to think about.", "Yeah I know that. I just was unaware of her having any other plans with anyone bar myself and whenever either of us plan something in the \"evening\", we're both in the house for 6, to start getting ready for 7. It's a routine for us, special date night or not. I would have given a time if I knew she had somewhere to be earlier in the day. I called at 6 because I was just generally worried as she hadn't texted/called like normal. \n\nI figured she would be out doing her own thing because she likes her own \"me-time\" where she'll go on walks or to a cafe or doing something purely by herself which is what I assumed she was doing that day since she never said she'd be doing anything different when I asked the night before. \n\nI know my girlfriend pretty well and what her habits are and what we do as a couple i. regards to date night which is why I felt comfortable surprising her and telling it as an evening plan. To us, that's a time and meeting place established which I thought she was going to stick to. I would have done things differently if I was aware she had a different plan for her day", "definitely NTA", "NTA. As soon as her old high school troup re-entered stage right, you became a stage prop. There was zero reason she could not have communicated at some point between leaving at lunchtime and you calling around 6 to tell you who she was with. Zero--unless she just didn't think of you. And that sucks.", "Hang on, her friends made super secret surprise plans, so obviously cora didn't know.\n\nBut then you said in the last paragraph she had all day to invite you and she didn't?

Very lacking in consideration for your plans. \n\nI understand her not wanting to apologise for spending time with friends.

Checking her location is creepy AF. \n\nOn her side: it is pretty suspicious that she didn't text you herself.
