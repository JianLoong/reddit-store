Looking down on people based on income is quite ugly, you say you're the smarter one, why stoop down to her level?", "ESH. Her fianc\u00e9 didn't do anything to you. The sequence:\n\nCousin: Calls you ugly (Asshole).\nYou: Stand up for yourself (great). In the process of doing so, call her fianc\u00e9 (who's not even there as far as I can tell!) the street's beggar. (Asshole.)", "ESH.", "ESH and you all sound childish and exhausting.", "This reads as fake.", "Info: how old are you and the cousin?", "ESH. You all sound like miserable and horrible people who get pleasure out of making other people miserable.", "ESH. Cousin is TA for insulting you. YTA for insulting an innocent person (her fiance).", "ESH", "ESH. I mean, it was a funny response given her crappy behavior and the family history. But have you ever flat out confronted them as adults and say to knock it off?", "ESH. Maybe y\u2019all just need a good ol brawl it out in the streets. Winner will forever be the better cousin.", "ESH. Your family shouldn't pit you against each other. Your cousin shouldn't have insulted you. But you shouldn't have fired back in this disgusting and classist way. Trying to use someone's socio-economic status as a marker of whether they're a good person or worth loving or could be a good partner is disgusting behaviour and you are definitely an asshole for saying that.   \nYour cousin is talking about her wedding because she's excited, which she has every right to be. Try being happy for her.", "ESH, it's gotta be so exhausting at your family meetings. She is the bigger AH by far, as she started the insults. Understandable that you kind of snapped.", "ESH. If you guys are busting balls then you need to: 1. have a sense of humor about it, and 2. not actually draw blood. If you're sincerely tearing each other down, then you have a serious case of arrested development and deserve each other.", "ESH Your family started this whole thing long ago, your cousin started it this time, and you climbed down and wrestled in the mud with her.\n\nEvery time you get into the mud with her you are degrading yourself. The only way to win is to refuse to play their game. See their attempts at manipulating your emotions by going for your weak points for what they are and refuse to give them any emotional response. If they want to upset you the most boring and unsatisfactory result for them is indifference.", "ESH you and your family are so rude. Do y\u2019all have any love/respect for one another? If you do, get family therapy. If not, stop spending time together. \n\nBut YTA for looking down on somebody because of their job & income. You\u2019re not better than anyone else, just different. Stop acting like a spoiled teenager and grow up.", "YTA. There's no good reason to match one insult with another. You're feeding into the competitiveness that is being promoted by the rest of your family. Bedsides, you chose a not-so-clever response. You both are pretty basic and ugly-spirited but you're the one asking for advice and I would have expected better of you.", "YTA because she made the nasty comment. You had no right attacking her fianc\u00e9 when he has done nothing to you. If you said something else, I would have said NTA. She definitely deserves a low blow, but not at the expense of someone who was innocent in all of this. Keep your fight directed at her.", "NTA.  She insulted you and you returned fire.  Well done.  If you don't defend yourself in these situations, people will walk all over you.", "ESH: (but your cousin is more of an asshole in this story)\n\nYou guys have a very toxic family life. If being that cruel to each is your standard get-together, then you guys need to not be getting together.", "NTA- tell her that she likes to talk shit but cant handle when it comes back, tell her im ok with being a bit ugly but it seems like she hasnt cone to terms with being poor yet and for that you are sorry!", "Great come back. nta", "Need to work on your makeup game girl.

Like seriously explain to me I can't understand it.\n\nI said I'm a vet so clearly not a kid or a teenager and we are thinking about marriage so clearly not old. Isn't that enough info for you?

So in general, this post feels a bit fake. \n\nIf it is not - This is surprising behavior of someone older than 16 and it\u2019s surprising of you, an educated and older woman, that you\u2019re putting up with this abusive language.

If you're going to use hard work as a metric for who you're better than or is better than you, income is irrelevant. Surely being the smart one, you should be able to see the inconsistencies and hypocrisy in your thought process.", "I think you misunderstand my general thinking. \n\nAlso, I believe it\u2019s an AITA posting rule to provide ages in the OP.", "Don\u2019t bother with this person.
