You couldn't be more wrong. I returned their pet so they could bury it, if my dog was hit and killed by a car I'd want them returned to me. I wrote them the note to try and get through to them, I've tried talking to them about it multiple times, face-to-face, and since talking didn't work I hoped a note might get the message across. I wrote that note because I didn't want to find another dead dog on my next drive, I didn't do it to mock them, I did it to warn them.", "The alternative was to leave it on the side of the road to get eaten by other animals. I returned the dog so they knew what happened to them/could give them a proper burial. The note was so they knew why the dog was dead/to hopefully make them realize that this could have easily been preventable. I didn't do it to be mean, I did it because I didn't want to find their next dog dead on the side of the road. Sometimes being brutally honest is the only way to get through to these types of people.", "Don't worry, if this happens again I won't be returning their next dead dog, the next one will be left for the coyotes, no note, no body, nothing. Next time will be different.", "Every time the dog came onto my property I told them face-to-face, that's about 4-5 times before the dog was killed. They didn't seem to be grieving, they were more upset about my note than the death of their dog. What I took from our interaction was that they could care less about the dog and were only upset about me calling them out on it.", "Do you see how this comes off this way, though? They find their dog dead on their porch and a note explaining why this is all their fault?", "Yeah I know exactly how 'brutally honest' people act. Not a good look on anybody but you do you", "So you weren't able to get through to them before and that justifies you using their dead pet as a final \"told you so\" moment? That's pretty twisted up. The mature and kind thing to do for the pet would be to give a respectful burial and say a few words. It's doubtful the neighbors would do anything other than throw the animal in the woods and let nature take its course. Some people never get it when it comes to animals. ESH", "They weren't even grieving after their pet died? That's horrible. It sounds like your neighbours may be psychopaths.", "That poor animal\u2019s life should be worth more than their momentary guilt and hurt feelings. They should have listened to OP, but didn\u2019t. Now they\u2019ll know for the future if they get another dog that OP wasn\u2019t being an alarmist or a jerk, but raising valid points. Yes, they\u2019re going to feel terrible and hate OP. But someone needs to stand up for that poor voiceless pup, who could have had a longer, happier life.", "It is their fault and they should know.  NTA", "It is all their fault.\n\nOP had to see a dog they knew dead in a ditch because the owners couldn't be bothered to take care of it at all.", "It came off as cold and heartless as their dog dying in a ditch alone. AKA appropriately. If you don\u2019t want to take care of your animals, you shouldn\u2019t have them. Stop making excuses for shitty people behaving like trash.", "Because it is, entirely, so factually and unmistakably their whole damn fault. Yes, you should be shamed for neglecting your animal and getting it killed because you can\u2019t be bothered to actually take care of it and wanted\u2026 the novelty of having a pet or something? That dog probably crawled off the road and laid there to suffer alone and in pain until it died.", "I understand how it came off, it came off cold, I get that, though it isn't about being kind, it's about (hopefully) sparing the next dog they own (if they decide to get another dog) from the same fate. Leaving the dog on the side of the road meant the coyotes would eat them so I returned them as an act of kindness. They wouldn't listen to me when the dog was alive so my hope was that they'd listen to me now that the dog is dead. It *is* their fault that their dog is dead and they *do* deserve to be called out on it. I wasn't going to wait a few weeks, months, or whatever else is an \"appropriate\" amount of time to call them out because in that time they could get another dog which is why I warned them the same day. I cared more about their dog than they did, every time the dog went on my property I cared for them, I gave them dog food, water, and kept them in an outdoor dog kennel with a heated dog house (I'm a dog owner myself so I have this stuff on hand). The poor dog was so skinny you could see their ribs. Do you really think they gave a damn that their dog died? No, they didn't. The *only* thing they were upset about was the note, they didn't care that their dog died. Who cares about the feelings of a neglectful owner? They deserve to feel bad about it because it *is* their fault, they're the ones who killed their dog.", "you're reaching. this is literally just a case of brutal honesty, not some hidden \"I'm actually an asshole\" situation", "NTA, the note was beyond deserved, the only cruel thing here was them neglecting their animal and letting it die alone on the side of the road in pain. I would call local shelters and report them for good measure, and if they get a dog somehow I\u2019d report to SPCA", "Listen, I agree with you that the owners did not take proper care of their dog, but you asked if your actions made you the asshole and I believe they do. What you did was unreasonable. There are better ways to go about it. \n\nAs far as them not grieving, you don't know that. God forbid one of your dogs gets out and gets hit by a car. Then, one of your neighbors does this exact thing to you. How would you feel towards that person? Might your anger overcome your grief for a moment?", "You suck and your neighbors suck too. You can't justify what you did because there's no excuse for being 'brutally honest'. You both suck", "People that are 'brutally honest' usually turn out to be assholes", "What would be a better way? I've tried talking to them about it politely, I've tried getting animal control involved, the neighbors have talked to them, etc. When the dog was alive it wasn't just my property the dog went on, it was the neighbors' too. The dog was on my property 4-5 times so who knows how many times it had been on my neighbors' properties. If the dog had wandered off once or twice and was then hit by a car I wouldn't have left them that note but this wasn't a one-time offense, this was several times throughout several months. I don't think what I did was unreasonable since the neighbors and I have tried kinder approaches but being polite didn't work with these people and now their dog is dead because they wouldn't listen the first time when we were being polite about it. I figured that if being kind about it while the dog was still alive didn't work then maybe if I tried being less kind about it now that the dog was dead would work, and sure enough, it seemed to have worked.  They didn't have much to say after I called them out, I think that means they finally understood what the other neighbors and I were trying to tell them. I didn't want to be rude to them but I didn't want their actions to kill any more dogs, I'd rather be insensitive and spare dogs from getting hit by cars than be kind and say nothing as their dogs are hit and killed by cars one after the other. I don't think you understand just how stupid these people are, they aren't the type of people who listen via talking, they need a more aggressive approach to get through to them. If hurting their feelings is what it takes to spare their next dog from the same fate then so be it.", "Would you have preferred that I left the dog for the coyotes, said nothing, and continue to say nothing when they buy another dog and the cycle repeats itself?"]}
