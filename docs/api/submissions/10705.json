One of my neighbors had a dog that got hit by a car. They neglected the dog, no ID, not neutered, underweight from going days without food since the dog spent most of their time wandering around lost, they kept the dog outside with no fencing, etc. I warned them countless times their dog will eventually get hit by a car, they didn't listen. I tried contacting animal control but they're understaffed and didn't help. That fateful day came, and while driving I saw the dog on the side of the road (I wasn't the one who hit them). I pulled over on the side of the road to check if the dog was alive but they weren't. I decided to return the dog to the owners. I loaded up the dog in my car to drop off at my neighbor's house and as I was driving to their house I figured that the dead dog alone would not be enough to make them realize this was their fault so I turned around and went home to type up a note and give them a piece of my mind. The note called them out on their neglect and I left it on top of the dog which I set on their doorstep, I was hoping this would be a wake-up call in case they got another dog, I didn't want to see a repeat of this. The owners' weren't happy with me and confronted me about it and when they did I told them I wouldn't have needed to type up a note had they just listened to me the first time and fenced in their dog, which shut them up real quick. I hope our interaction was the wake-up call they needed though I'm not sure since they're stupid. To be clear, they weren't upset that their dog died, they were mad at me because I called them out for being neglectful owners.\n\nEdit 1: Since a few people have asked, no, they don't have kids. If they did I wouldn't have done this since I'm above traumatizing kids to make a point. These are adults in their late 30's or early 40's.\n\nEdit 2: To all the people saying I should've done more or done \\_\\_\\_ instead, I live with my parents, I don't have my own car (I was driving my mom's car that day, with permission), and I didn't have any money that I could've spent on care for the dog when they were alive.

I cared more about their dog than they did, every time the dog went on my property I cared for them, I gave them dog food, water, and kept them in an outdoor dog kennel with a heated dog house (I'm a dog owner myself so I have this stuff on hand). The poor dog was so skinny you could see their ribs. Do you really think they gave a damn that their dog died? No, they didn't.

What you did was unreasonable. There are better ways to go about it. \n\nAs far as them not grieving, you don't know that. God forbid one of your dogs gets out and gets hit by a car. Then, one of your neighbors does this exact thing to you. How would you feel towards that person? Might your anger overcome your grief for a moment?", "You suck and your neighbors suck too.

The dog was on my property 4-5 times so who knows how many times it had been on my neighbors' properties. If the dog had wandered off once or twice and was then hit by a car I wouldn't have left them that note but this wasn't a one-time offense, this was several times throughout several months. I don't think what I did was unreasonable since the neighbors and I have tried kinder approaches but being polite didn't work with these people and now their dog is dead because they wouldn't listen the first time when we were being polite about it. I figured that if being kind about it while the dog was still alive didn't work then maybe if I tried being less kind about it now that the dog was dead would work, and sure enough, it seemed to have worked.  They didn't have much to say after I called them out, I think that means they finally understood what the other neighbors and I were trying to tell them all along. I didn't want to be rude to them but I didn't want their actions to kill any more dogs, I'd rather be insensitive and spare dogs from getting hit by cars than be kind and say nothing as their dogs are hit and killed by cars one after the other.
