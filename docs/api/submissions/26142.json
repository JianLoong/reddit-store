Know that, going forward, and for the rest of your life, they will ALWAYS have some sort of drama going on that makes it a bad time for you to stop sending them money. They won't just 'let' you stop, unless you are strong enough to keep doing what you're doing now. I know this is a cultural expectation, but you are 100% correct that they should be acknowledging you and thanking you, not ignoring you while just taking your money. They're biting the hand that feeds them. You're also enabling their laziness.\n\nA bit personal here, but you should also know that if you wind up with a non-Filipino partner at some point in the future, this will be a MAJOR stressor in your relationship. Divorce rates are higher in marriages between cultures that share finances within the family and cultures who do not share finances with the family (damn, I can't find the source where I read that). But your UK-born husband isn't going to want to share his and your money with your relatives back home.", "NTA.
