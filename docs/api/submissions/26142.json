Know that, going forward, and for the rest of your life, they will ALWAYS have some sort of drama going on that makes it a bad time for you to stop sending them money. They won't just 'let' you stop, unless you are strong enough to keep doing what you're doing now. I know this is a cultural expectation, but you are 100% correct that they should be acknowledging you and thanking you, not ignoring you while just taking your money. They're biting the hand that feeds them. You're also enabling their laziness.\n\nA bit personal here, but you should also know that if you wind up with a non-Filipino partner at some point in the future, this will be a MAJOR stressor in your relationship. Divorce rates are higher in marriages between cultures that share finances within the family and cultures who do not share finances with the family (damn, I can't find the source where I read that). But your UK-born husband isn't going to want to share his and your money with your relatives back home.", "NTA.

I am Filipino myself but I would not think twice about cancelling those monthly payments. I would understand if you still wanted to support your brother but you have to talk to him first about how you\u2019re feeling and how upsetting it is to feel like an ATM and see what his reaction is. If after that, he tries harder to have a relationship with you then that\u2019s great!\n\nAs for your dad. Just cut that off completely.

No hi, no nothing, when I said I had 5 dollars that he can have, that thats all I had (besides my bills and my saving) no response.", "Fellow Pinoy here.\n\nNTA. Although I was born and raised in the US, and so have very American sensibilities about money and how it should be used to help family members who are less fortunate,  I completely understand the sense of obligation one feels in sending money back home. My mother was the only member of her family to make it to the US and sent a considerable amount of money home. She taught me of our duty to help our less fortunate relatives. \n\nHowever, over the years, I came to disdain, even hate my relatives, because they only ever corresponded with my mom to ask for MORE money than she was already giving them. They would always have some made-up crisis that required MORE money. My mom, under the burden of obligation, would usually cave in and give the money, which always caused friction in our house. \n\nWhat cinched the disdain and dislike of my relatives for me was when we visited my grandma in the Philippines. She of course asked for money (but didn't even ask us how we were, whether we wanted a drink, or anything like that). My mom gave money to her, upon which my grandmother called over one of my cousins (and she didn't even bother to introduce us) and he ran off with the money she gave him, after my grandma had given him some instructions I didn't hear. \n\nI later found out that she used the money my mom had given her to 1) Buy food for a party - but not for us, this would be the next day, after we flew out 2) Pay off her gambling debts 3) Buy herself some cheesy gold necklace that she had apparently already asked my mom several times to buy for her. \n\nSo basically, my relatives were lazy ass entitled bums and my mom to them was just an ATM. No gratitude, no thanks, no sense of reciprocation even in the way of food and drink - just a bunch of lazy fucking assholes who took advantage of my mom and her generosity. \n\nOP's family sound similar.", "NTA. As a fellow Filipino working in the UK I can heavily relate to this. I had relatives that would only contact me and my family for money, so what me and my brother did was cut off every single contact we had with them. You're not an ATM machine and it's about damn time you and they realise that.", "NTA do not give them money if they can\u2019t afford everything they have that\u2019s on them"]}
