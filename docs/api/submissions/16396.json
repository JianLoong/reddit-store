He wouldn't respond that way and have to convince people he is nice this way. B) he is indirectly saying \"the only a girl can really mean 'no'.. is if she's absolutely not into men at all\" and C) all of the above gives me the impression he'd also tell his buddies \"she just hasn't met the right man to change her mind.. I can totally turn her straight\" and then proceed to keep harassing her.. \n\nMaybe I am wrong on my impression.. but I think we have *all* encountered guys like that or will at some point, and that's the vibe I get from OP's description of his actions and responses to being rejected.", "No.", "NTA \\~", "You're a huge asshole.

Bad enough he put her on the spot in public in the first place, but to then expect her to give her a public explanation why takes it to a whole other level.", "The person said it doesn't matter because they figure she would've said no anyway. I can think of thee reasons why the whole thing seems incredibly juvenile.\n\n1.) He shouldnt've asked in front of a bunch of random people who see each other everyday. You need to have an escape plan. If you have to ask a girl out at school, you do it on a Friday and in the afternoon. Whatever you do, don't risk her saying no and having to sit there.

He not only asked why not but referred to himself as 'such a great guy.' If this actually happened then he had some real growing up to do.\n\n3.) If you plan to ask someone out, do not tell anybody. I'm 40 years old this year and this is the first I've ever heard where the person didn't gossip to everyone and ruin any chance there may have been. I guess op may have omitted this part so it could be that it did happen. Never tell anyone if there's any chance of them speaking to this person before you do. They never talk you up, they never help you out, they cannot increase your chances and they absolutely can ruin it. That's kids stuff.\n\nBottom line is that it isn't OP's place to out her friend.

NTA", "But he never said he was going to ask her out NTA", "NTA. It's never someones business to out someone. You did the right thing. This is not a you problem. The only thing I would do from here is ask Hannah how she wants you to handle similar situations in the future.", "I met a girl who was a lifelong lesbian, me at the time 30, her 40, and long story short we ended up in bed after only a few hours of meeting.", "NTA \nMason was his own worst enemy you told him he wasn't her type you 100% did warn him he is a child though and is blaming you.", "NTA\n\nI thought you handled this really really well. You didn\u2019t out your friend and you told Mason that he want her type. \n\nCould you have told Mason more firmly? Maybe but it\u2019s not like you really had the time to do that. And given his inability to take a No I\u2019m not sure what you could have said.", "Why are you even involved?  This isn't your story to tell.\n\nIf he wants to know about her hobbies, interests, and relationship status he should do what everyone else does.  ASK HER.  \"You'll have to ask her about that...\" should have been the only response to any of his questions.\n\nHis humiliation is entirely on him.   Not sure why he decided to make a public scene out of asking her out.   He's pretty much asking to be humiliated after all that.  And then he tried the nice guy routine....  but he didn't even invest enough in a faux friendship with her to even make THAT claim.  \n\nSo..  two bits of advice you can give him.\n\n1.  His humiliation will be short lived if he hurries up and gets off the  drama train.  quit crying and accept it and everyone will forget about it and move on to someone else's gossip-worthy shenannigans.  \n\n2.  If he was quick on his feet or had a rejection plan in place, he could have easily come up with a response that wasn't quite so pathetic.  \"Oh... so lesbians don't go to the movies?\"  or  \"I was asking you to the movies, not to get married....\" *glance down at himself kneeling before her and quickly stand up*  ...  or hear \"no\" the first time and not keep pushing the issue.", "NTA With this guy's social awareness this was bound to happen sooner or later", "NTA. She could have said no even if she wasn't a lesbian, and that should be an accepted answer.", "NTA\n\nYou did everything right. He made an ass of himself by doing a dramatic public display.", "NTA  \n\n\nYou told him he wasn't her type, he didn't take the hint, and you let Hannah decide for herself to talk about why.", "NTA.  You said he wasn't her type and he isn't.  He went for it anyway.  You didn't out her, you did the right thing. He's just blaming anyone but him for his bad choices.  He should have taken your advice and he shouldn't have publicly asked her our like that (trying to embarrass her into saying yes).  He's TA.", "NTA it's not your problem that he decided to embarass himself like that", "But he is such a nice guy!!", "And he made his own bed by doubling down when rejected. Instead of gracefully accepting the no, he pushed harder, and earned the explanation he would otherwise have avoided.", "Finally, someone with common sense! This sub is so unreasonable.. these are high school kids", "She hadn't mentioned it publicly at that point. OP did the right thing.", "It wasn't that obvious though. That was *before* Hannah told him she was a lesbian publicly. Until that point, OP wasn't sure if Hannah was out or not, which is why she didn't tell him.", "Might not have stopped him necessarily. OP's response was perfect - truthful without blabbing something Hannah might not want shared. OP obviously has a good attitude and is very thoughtful.", ">In fact, that's half the point of asking like that. Banking on the fact that the person will feel obligated to say yes because they're trying to be kind and not reject someone publicly/embarrass them. It's manipulative.\n\nThe saying \"never attribute to malice what can be attributed to incompetence\" rings pretty loud here. 17 year olds haven't had the time and experience to realize that the nonsense they are bombarded with from romcoms and tv shows is not how things work in real life.", "Because she's allowed not to fancy him regardless. He'd already been told he wasn't her type and he chose to ignore that. And yes, some guys do still try to pressure women they're fully aware are gay or ace. I've had it happen to me. I'm not saying Mason would have done that necessarily, but even being publicly out doesn't protect you from arrogant people who think they know better.", "I think the best way for this is at someone else's wedding, so many people conveniently there and dressed up for the occasion. How could they say no?", "OP stated literally that her sexuality wasn't a secret. She just didn't think it was her place. And I understand here in that, which is why its a \"very soft yta\". I just think that when she saw where this was heading that she could have prevented it.", "Idk.  The guy is 16 so he could just be stupid and embarrassed.", "As a boy who was \"too much of a crybaby\" as a teen, I can tell that crying in front of the class as a boy at that age is the last thing you would do on purpose.", "I think its more likely he was crying because hes a teenage boy that just got embarrased.\n\nLike jesus christ there's no need to crucify a child just becuase he's a boy.", "Given that they are 17, chances are he was just normally stupid and confused romance movie with real life.", "I've had the same thing telling people I'm asexual. We don't owe them that information, but you'd think they'd  at least understand from that that the rejection isn't personal and just drop it. I thought I was doing him a kindness letting him know that so he'd know not to waste his time. Instead he called me a liar and when that didn't work, he said arrogantly \"But you've met me now!\" So yeah, knowing your sexual orientation doesn't necessarily stop some people.", "I'm a woman and have never done any of those things, neither have any other women I know. Where do you live that \"females\" do that?", "I would assume it would be \"cringier\" if anything.", "Eh.  The kid learned a valuable lessen that day:  Hollywood isn't real", "That's not a take I've ever heard. The lesbian rejection is a classic easy way to let down a man, because how could they possibly take that personally? Of course there is often a creepy follow up, so it must be used with caution.", "So?", "NTA. You didn't \"let him\" be humiliated. You warned him that he wasn't her type and he ignored you. Then instead of asking in a private moment, he upped the stakes and asked her out in the most public-pressure way ever, refused to take no for an answer, and demanded she supply a good reason for turning him down. \n\nIt's not your fault that he did that in front of the whole class, after ignoring your warning.\n\nHere's what he refuses to acknowledge: you didn't owe him knowledge about her sexuality if he wasn't already privy to it, and even if she were straight she would been absolutely valid in turning him down - and that's before you get to all the pressure tactics he used that say he isn't ready for a healthy relationship yet. When you ask people out, it's a vulnerable position. You have to be prepared for the fact that a) they might not be reciprocally interested in you and b) they don't owe you a reason for that disinterest.", "NTA  even if she isn't a lesbian, No means fucking no. You she doesn't need to justify that rejection. And for him to ask her out in so extravagant a manner Is immature, manipulating and the signs he's watched a few to many teen rom movies where the over the top gesture gets the girl...\n\nHow about how humiliated Hannah was at being approached in such a manner. \n\n\"Your not her type\" was warning enough.", "But but but he's gonna be a nice guy even though she said not.\n\nNTA regardless of her preferences you knew he wouldn't be her type and you told him so and he chose to ignore that ask her very publicly (and quite over the top) and she said no.", "NTA and you were absolutely right and a GREAT FRIEND. \n\n1. You didn't out her.\n\n2. You gave him a heads-up he could've understand if he wasn't overstepping.\n\n3. You protected her feelings as well as his. \n\nWell done. He's learned a lesson I hope. A \"no\" means \"no\". A woman doesn't have to coddle a man's hurt feelings. She doesn't owe him.", "NTA \"you're not her type\": he's been warned enough", "NTA. You did right by Hannah and gave Mason a clear answer. Not your fault that he didn't take your word for it, and not your fault he decided to ask her out in public. Hannah's sexuality is a moot point; who's to say he wouldn't have thought he could \"change Hannah's mind\" even if he did know she's a lesbian? Who's to say she wouldn't have turned him down even if she were straight? Why does she have to justify her rejection at all? Mason's just shifting goal posts so he can blame you instead of himself for making poor decisions.", "Def NTA. \n\nLike... OP clearly told Mason he wasn't Hannah's type and yet he still asked her out so OP had literally nothing to do with his humiliation. \nPlus someone's sexuality is a pretty personal thing and so OP had every right not to out Hannah. \n\nIf there's an asshole in this story it's Def Mason: the guy really put the blame on OP and disregarded the fact that he could have just asked her out privately and saved his ass the humiliation (if he really wanted to confess that badly) . But nope, dude wanted grand confession and so he got a grand humiliation.", "Asking out a person you know jack shit about is just inviting trouble at this point not to mention the way he proposed in a public place with exaggerated gesture", "NTA he's kind of dumb", "Nta. He's stupid to ask her out publicly. Even if she wasn't a lesbian", "He wasnt humiliated because she\u2019s a lesbian. He was humiliated because of his theatrics in asking for a date, and begging when she said no. She shouldnt even have needed to spell it out. His response should have been \u2018ok thats fine\u2019 and not one person would have seen it had he not decided to go over the top and do it in front of everyone like a cheesy promposal.\nNTA", "NTA at all, you did the right thing. He set himself up by being so flamboyant about the way he asked her out... she had all the rights to turn him down regardless of her sexuality. Reeks of toxic masculinity and nice guy vibes. I'm willing to cut him a pass since he's basically a kid but i hope he learned his lesson here - he's not owed a date just for existing.", "NTA at all, you warned him she wouldn't accept without divulging personal information, which was in fact a great solution and the right thing to do! He entirely brought this on himself by a) not listening to you, b) getting on a damn knee in front of everyone just to ask her to see a bloody movie and most importantly, and what makes him a ginormous butthole c) not accepting her no and pushing her. No means no. He should've just walked away. As far as rejections go, \"you belong to a whole group of people that I'm not interested in due to my sexuality\" is a rather gentle one.", "NTA and also I'm honestly relieved that Hannah *is* a lesbian lol because if she was straight the situation and having to say no would have been way more uncomfortable for her.", "NTA!\nNever out someone without their clear okay to do so.", "NTA", "NTA. You did your part in trying to dissuade him while also not outing your friend without her permission. His method of asking her out was very ill-advised - doing it in public like that, there's an element of peer pressure (like with public proposals) for the person being asked to say yes - he got what he deserved on that one. I hate that he was embarrassed in front of the class, but at the same time, you have to somewhat expect that's a possibility if you're going to choose that method.", "NTA. He's the asshole for not taking no for an answer.", "ESH, except for Mason.\n\nHe dug up the courage to ask somebody out, and got rejected.  What's humiliating about that?\n\nHe didn't know she's a Lesbian.  Good.  How's he supposed to know if nobody's told him?  What's 'humiliating' about not knowing something about somebody?  We castigate people who 'assume' sexuality and gender all the damn time, so good on him for not doing that.\n\nETA: My god, all the comments about how he purposefully did it publicly to pressure her into saying yes, then manipulatively cried solely to make her feel bad are disgusting.  He's a 16-year-old kid who's grown up watching western media and modern social media glamorize big public requests, then got laughed at by everybody.  He's not some Machiavellian pick up artist, he's a clueless teenager doing clueless teenager things.", "NTA", "Lol you said he's not her type, which is completely true, so you did tell him. NTA", "NTA. You didn't want to out your friend and you told him flat out she would not be interested. Not only could he not take a hint, he couldn't take a straight forward answer from you. Sorry it made him cry though. Hopefully he processes his pain properly.", "NTA you were absolutely right not to out her. No question.", "Nta. Not outing someone is the right move if you aren't sure.\n\nYou tried to dissuade him.  \n\nAlso dude needs to tone it down. That was way too extra for asking a girl out.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEW, wtf is wrong with Mason, why is he asking someone out in such a public way, what if she just wasn't into him?", "NTA.\n\nAw, poor straight boy made a gross assumption he should never make about anyone, and made a fool of himself. The absolute hubris it takes to think everyone is just like him is galling.\n\nOP did what she thought was best by protecting her friend's privacy. It is not up to her to disclose that sort of information, and she did warn the crybaby \"he was not her type.\"", "He got down on 1 one knee... to ask her to go to the movies...and then cried when she said \"No, sorry, I'm a lesbian\".\n\nNAH, Just 1 cringey 17 y/o. \n\nId argue the biggest AH is his friend who came at you to back him up. At least the guy who cried was emotionally compromised, why is this guy butting in and getting involved?", "Bro got on one knee\ud83d\udc80 I\u2019d say he humiliated himself. NTA", "You should never, ever feel bad for a guy getting his feelings hurt for something that was his own damn fault. He just wants to blame someone. YTA.  I hate that girls are raised to apologise to guys for everything they do to themselves.  It was not your place to discuss your friends sexuality.  You handled it perfectly.  Idiot guy did not.", "Also op told him he's not her type NTA", "Nope. It was incredibly manipulative of Mason to ask Hannah out in such a public way.", "Why would op go around and give him advice ?", "Bullshit.  The point is that this is how things are done these days.  See the story about the high school girl who was sad that this big public display *didn't* happen for her.", "Yes, as a male, getting publicly laughed at by the whole class would have zero emotional impact, men don't have emotions.  Instead, he called upon his acting talents to produce tears on command solely for the purpose of harming her.", "That kind of guys are total idiots.", "Her sexuality wasn't a secret but she wasn't open about it either, that's why OP erred on the side of caution. OP is also not an AH for assuming Mason would just drop it or for not realising that only Hannah being gay would be a good enough \"excuse\" for him. No one has to fancy anyone else, orientation is beside the point.", "One no one has to tell you about someone else sexuality for you to not accept you aren\u2019t their type. He decided to ask her out publicly to manipulate her and now it backfired.

They aren't doing well.", "But that's the problem: People are giving their response based upon the actions of Mason after the thing this question is actually about. Mason acted like a fool, we can all agree on that. But that's not what this question was about. But that's often the case with /r aita :)  \n\n\nAnd never forget: This subreddit is about opinions. I'm of opinion that if someone's sexuality isn't a secret and you know someone who is interested in that someone you'd be a nice person to warn that person. Others are of a different opinion. If everyone had the same opinion this would be a very boring subreddit.", "Yeah and even for the question that was asked the answer is still NTA. She didn't know if her friend wanted him to know so she didn't tell him. She even warned him that he shouldn't ask her out. All of this is on him."]}
