He wouldn't respond that way and have to convince people he is nice this way. B) he is indirectly saying \"the only a girl can really mean 'no'.. is if she's absolutely not into men at all\" and C) all of the above gives me the impression he'd also tell his buddies \"she just hasn't met the right man to change her mind.. I can totally turn her straight\" and then proceed to keep harassing her.. \n\nMaybe I am wrong on my impression.. but I think we have *all* encountered guys like that or will at some point, and that's the vibe I get from OP's description of his actions and responses to being rejected.", "No.", "NTA \\~", "You're a huge asshole.

It was Mason who chose to ask her out dramatically in front of everyone, and Mason who reaped the consequences.\n\nEveryone experiences rejection.

Bad enough he put her on the spot in public in the first place, but to then expect her to give her a public explanation why takes it to a whole other level.", "The person said it doesn't matter because they figure she would've said no anyway. I can think of thee reasons why the whole thing seems incredibly juvenile.\n\n1.) He shouldnt've asked in front of a bunch of random people who see each other everyday. You need to have an escape plan. If you have to ask a girl out at school, you do it on a Friday and in the afternoon. Whatever you do, don't risk her saying no and having to sit there.

He not only asked why not but referred to himself as 'such a great guy.' If this actually happened then he had some real growing up to do.\n\n3.) If you plan to ask someone out, do not tell anybody. I'm 40 years old this year and this is the first I've ever heard where the person didn't gossip to everyone and ruin any chance there may have been. I guess op may have omitted this part so it could be that it did happen. Never tell anyone if there's any chance of them speaking to this person before you do. They never talk you up, they never help you out, they cannot increase your chances and they absolutely can ruin it. That's kids stuff.\n\nBottom line is that it isn't OP's place to out her friend.

No is no. \n\nOP, NTA", "You're arguing from stereotypes that have no basis in reality. Men are capable of inferential reasoning.\n\nOP said that he was not Hannah's type. There is nothing ambiguous about that statement. He chose to ignore that information and ask her out in a very public way. The fault is entirely on him, while OP did the right thing by respecting Hannah's privacy. OP should not have to disrespect Hannah to preserve Mason's feelings.", "Her sexuality didn't matter. He was going to be rejected regardless.", "The entire class laughed at him for not knowing.which means every one of them knew she was lesbian. It's not outing someone if you tell the only person who doesn't know.", "[removed]", "[removed]", "Stereotypes exist for a reason. It is commonly agreed amongst men that we are bad at taking hints from women. In my many years on earth, I've never heard a single man claim to be good at taking hints from women. I've heard more than i can count say they can't take hints. Not to mention, every guy on earth has a story of a missed opportunity with a woman because he didn't realize what she was hinting until years later. \n\nAlso someone told me I wasn't my wife's type. Turns out she disagreed. Should I let her know we need a divorce because I'm not her type?", "Because he has a penis. If she did happen to have a crush on him she wouldn\u2019t have said no", "The entire class laughed because he did a public stunt that backfired lol. He did the absolute most public thing and she was like \"??? No?\" and they were laughing at him because he got rejected.\n\nNo way everyone knew she is gay, there's undoubtedly people who didn't know about it because they aren't friends and never heard about it. And even if they did \u2014 yes, it can still be outing then...Gay people have to come out to people in different areas of life all the time. Just cause you might be out to certain friends or people in your private life doesn't mean you're out to your coworkers or teachers (or adults in general if you're a kid) and it would be messed up if someone told people you didn't want to know.", "Why is it right to assume someone is straight? \n\nIf you assume random stuff about people and it turns out it was the wrong assumption it is always 100% on you for doing that. Your peers aren't your PR company lol or executive assistant to line all this stuff up for you and make sure you're good to go. Especially because OP is just the person who sits next to this dude. They have no pre-established relationship where he'd be a person OP would confide this stuff in. They just sit next to each other, she doesn't know him from Adam at the end of the day.\n\nAnd no...I only ask people out in private because I don't like making people uncomfortable especially when I don't know them enough to know what they would prefer, but that's just me.", "Well when he directly asked *her* instead of her *friend* he got the answer he needed. It wasn\u2019t OP\u2019s place to divulge her friend sexuality anyway.", "But she didn't have a crush on him, even if she were straight that doesn't mean she would have a crush on him. Her sexuality does not matter.\n\nETA: instead of circling the same points I'll state the ultimate point: Outing people without their permission is shitty no matter what. Unless you got a gun to your head, outing is a shitty move period. Her sexuality is none of his business. No means no, he shouldn't need a \"valid\" reason like her sexuality. Her sexuality does not matter. No means no.", "I interpreted the whole class going silent as being because the knew just how much he was making a fool of himself. Everyone at my school would have ignored this type of public display unless they knew they were about to witness a train wreck. And I agree outing people is wrong but OP was pretty clear that her friend doesn't hide her sexuality.", "[removed]", "Disagree.", "IMO, it was something where it was a spectacle and it was either gonna be a huge awww or a \"lmfao get rekt\" moment, but that was by design! Mason literally chose to get up there and get everyone's attention and do that! No one forced him. That's just the bad side of a public thing like that.\n\nAlso whether she wants to be open with everyone or not is her choice but OP specifically says \"Hannah doesn\u2019t really try to hide her sexuality, but she isn\u2019t super open about it either.\" Which to me means she is OK talking about it on her terms to friends or if she is asked directly she will not lie about it but she also doesn't put it out there to people she doesn't know on her own. And that seems consistent with how things played out.", "> the whole class was silent for a moment before she said \u201cSorry, no. I\u2019m not interested\u201d.\n\nThe girl only went \u201cI thought you knew I was gay\u201d after he insisted. Publicly. Pressuring her.\n\nI understand your need to defend the guy. Sincerely, learn with his mistake and don\u2019t do it yourself.\n\nI won\u2019t call him a dick as he\u2019s 16 y/o and likely clueless. Teenagers are not obligated to have it figured out. There\u2019s also the issue of massive misrepresentation and bad portrayal of relationship dynamics in the media. Grand gestures are treated as the way to a girl\u2019s heart by entertainment. In reality most people don\u2019t like feeling cornered by being publicly put on the spot.", "No means no, her sexuality does not matter she said no. Period.", "Yeah OP clarified for me. I just misunderstood the situation and they are NTA"]}
