He wouldn't respond that way and have to convince people he is nice this way. B) he is indirectly saying \"the only a girl can really mean 'no'.. is if she's absolutely not into men at all\" and C) all of the above gives me the impression he'd also tell his buddies \"she just hasn't met the right man to change her mind.. I can totally turn her straight\" and then proceed to keep harassing her.. \n\nMaybe I am wrong on my impression.. but I think we have *all* encountered guys like that or will at some point, and that's the vibe I get from OP's description of his actions and responses to being rejected.", "No.", "NTA \\~", "You're a huge asshole.

I can think of thee reasons why the whole thing seems incredibly juvenile.\n\n1.) He shouldnt've asked in front of a bunch of random people who see each other everyday. You need to have an escape plan. If you have to ask a girl out at school, you do it on a Friday and in the afternoon. Whatever you do, don't risk her saying no and having to sit there.

He not only asked why not but referred to himself as 'such a great guy.' If this actually happened then he had some real growing up to do.\n\n3.) If you plan to ask someone out, do not tell anybody. I'm 40 years old this year and this is the first I've ever heard where the person didn't gossip to everyone and ruin any chance there may have been. I guess op may have omitted this part so it could be that it did happen. Never tell anyone if there's any chance of them speaking to this person before you do. They never talk you up, they never help you out, they cannot increase your chances and they absolutely can ruin it. That's kids stuff.\n\nBottom line is that it isn't OP's place to out her friend.

It is commonly agreed amongst men that we are bad at taking hints from women. In my many years on earth, I've never heard a single man claim to be good at taking hints from women. I've heard more than i can count say they can't take hints. Not to mention, every guy on earth has a story of a missed opportunity with a woman because he didn't realize what she was hinting until years later. \n\nAlso someone told me I wasn't my wife's type.

No?\" and they were laughing at him because he got rejected.\n\nNo way everyone knew she is gay, there's undoubtedly people who didn't know about it because they aren't friends and never heard about it. And even if they did \u2014 yes, it can still be outing then...Gay people have to come out to people in different areas of life all the time.

They have no pre-established relationship where he'd be a person OP would confide this stuff in. They just sit next to each other, she doesn't know him from Adam at the end of the day.\n\nAnd no...I only ask people out in private because I don't like making people uncomfortable especially when I don't know them enough to know what they would prefer, but that's just me.", "Well when he directly asked *her* instead of her *friend* he got the answer he needed.

Her sexuality does not matter.\n\nETA: instead of circling the same points I'll state the ultimate point: Outing people without their permission is shitty no matter what. Unless you got a gun to your head, outing is a shitty move period. Her sexuality is none of his business. No means no, he shouldn't need a \"valid\" reason like her sexuality. Her sexuality does not matter. No means no.", "I interpreted the whole class going silent as being because the knew just how much he was making a fool of himself.

Mason literally chose to get up there and get everyone's attention and do that! No one forced him. That's just the bad side of a public thing like that.\n\nAlso whether she wants to be open with everyone or not is her choice but OP specifically says \"Hannah doesn\u2019t really try to hide her sexuality, but she isn\u2019t super open about it either.\" Which to me means she is OK talking about it on her terms to friends or if she is asked directly she will not lie about it but she also doesn't put it out there to people she doesn't know on her own.

There\u2019s also the issue of massive misrepresentation and bad portrayal of relationship dynamics in the media. Grand gestures are treated as the way to a girl\u2019s heart by entertainment.

That's a fairly inappropriate way to ask any girl on a first date, even if you're exactly her type. It seems like he was really counting on the pressure of not \"embarrassing\" him in front of everyone and making herself look like the bad guy to get her to say yes, and didn't expect a response as ironclad as \"I'm a lesbian.\" Mason is clueless at best and had insidiously bad intentions at worst, and frankly either way this is such a minor humiliation in the grand scheme of things that it was probably good for him. Him being embarrassed after you gave him pretty clear indication of what would happen WITHOUT outing her doesn't mean you somehow \"owed\" it to him to out her.", "Not nearly as bad but this gave me flashbacks to when a guy in HS I didn\u2019t particularly like asked me to a dance with two of his friends (one of them filming) as like, witnesses? I was way more of a pushover back then but still said no because I didn\u2019t want to be shoehorned into it. \ud83d\ude28\n\nI think, like a lot of people suggested here, Mason took \u201cnot her type\u201d to create a situation where she\u2019d feel obligated to accept the date.

He humiliated himself, you and Hannah did nothing wrong.", "NTA if you didn\u2019t feel like it was your place to say your friends sexuality then don\u2019t. You told him he wasn\u2019t her type that is a good sign for someone to not go for it.

You weren\u2019t sure if it was ok to tell him or not, always good to air on the side of caution and not out people if you aren\u2019t sure. \n\nThe embarrassment is kinda on him for being so extra about it.

That was a situation he created.", "NTA.  You told him he wasn't her type - why would he think a grand gesture would suddenly make him her type?   This is all on him for ignoring what you told him.", "NTA, later in life people tend to care less about their sexuality compared to in highschool. But as is it's not your place to announce her sexuality so you did the next best thing, she's not interested in you. He didn't take the \"hint\" you basically held up a red stop sign and he kept going. Him making a big ol scene infront of the class was in him. He could have asked her in private, he didn't. \n\n\"You're not her type...\"\n\"Well what is her type?\"\n\"The dickless kind....\"\n\nHis awkwardness doesn't make you TA\nHe shot he missed wide, now he's lashing out", "NTA. You did the right thing. Unless someone is VERY out of the closet it's never ok to disclose the sexuality of someone else. He kinda set himself up here, yikes.

It's not that big of a deal, in a few years it'll be a funny story.", "Nta \n\nHe was embarrassed because he asked her out in front of the entire class, not because you didn't tell him she was a lesbian \n\nNext time he doesn't want to be embarrassed by a public rejection, he can find a more appropriate way to invite someone on a date \n\nAlso, why not grow a thicker skin and just laugh it off? Getting rejected because someone is a lesbian is a lot less embarrassing than because they think you're ugly or don't like your personality. This is one of the least hurtful and least personal rejections he'll ever receive.  He definitely fanned the flames of his shame by flipping out rather than keeping his cool. \n\nI do feel bad for him though. He's just a kid and doesn't know how to handle his emotions yet. Being so embarrassed he started crying, and then crying in front of the whole class, must have absolutely sucked.
