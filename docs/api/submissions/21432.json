They have two kids, my little cousins Willow (9) and Miles (6). My aunt recently bought a switch for the cousins, and they\u2019ve been getting obsessed with Mario Kart. \n\nAlmost immediately, the cousins challenged me, my parents, and my sister to a race. I had to go help my uncle with his car (I work part time at an auto shop and had promised to take a look at it) but said that I would be back to race once I was finished. \n\nAbout thirty minutes later, I came back into the house and my cousins met me at the door to get me to race, it was adorable. We sat down and played, and I smoked them. I\u2019m not particularly good at Mario Kart, but I\u2019ve been playing for a while and they just started playing two weeks ago. The cousins demanded a rematch and I obliged, then when I smoked them again, a re-rematch. Several rounds and not a single victory later, Willow was in awe of my \u201cepic skills\u201d, but Miles started crying. \n\nMy aunt, having heard Miles crying, came in the room and I explained the situation. My aunt comforted Miles while my mom took me aside. Apparently, there had been an unspoken agreement between my mom, aunt, and sister to go easy on my cousins and let them win. My mom called me a jerk for being \u201cso mean\u201d to my cousins. I told her that I didn\u2019t know, and she called me an idiot because apparently it\u2019s common knowledge to go easy on kids.

Kids don\u2019t need to win every time, and it is good for them to learn to lose gracefully. However if you\u2019re competing against elementary school age kids there\u2019s a point to notice that the kids are getting frustrated and figure out how to make the game fun again - instead of seeing who can win the 3rd time say, \u201clet\u2019s try to get all the power ups\u201d or \u201clet\u2019s try goofy track X\u201d or something. It\u2019s not about intentionally throwing the game, it\u2019s about finding ways to meet kids at their level of ability and have fun with them. \n\nPersonal example: I was about 15 before I realized that when I was in elementary school playing nickel-ante poker with my uncles and cousins I actually sucked at poker, they kept me in the game by sliding coins to me every time they got up from the table to get a drink or whatever, telling me to play a few rounds for them. I got to hang out with the men and they got to have fun teasing me at the poker table and teaching me swear words. There are ways to include kids without stooping to outright throwing the game or humiliating them because they\u2019re less skilled.", "Nta. It's kind of an unwritten rule to go easy on younger kids, but no one should find you tah because of that (unless you were like, smack talking them lol don't do that).\n\nI do not let my kids win at Mario kart. My youngest gets sad sometimes. We cheer them up after, or show them how to be faster.", "NAH because you technically didn't do anything wrong but really, you should take it easy on little kids.\n\nYeah yeah little kids need to learn that you can't win them all but at the same time little kids need the occasional confidence boost and you absolutely destroying them in a video game isn't going to help with that.  Maybe you didn't have to let them win but at the same time you could have maybe not beaten them quite as badly.", "YTA \n\nYou don\u2019t \u201c smoke \u201c 6 years old who just got the game.

I wouldn\u2019t feel too bad about it, but in the future, I might not just absolutely relentlessly cream a six-year-old over and over. Yes, there is a legitimate argument to be made against over-praising a child. There is also a legitimate argument to be made about letting a little child have a mastery experience, especially when they have tried repeatedly.", "NTA\n\nNo one told you, you didn\u2019t know.

Kids don\u2019t need to be winning all the time. Letting them have a few seconds before you react yea, letting them win, no. That way when they win they feel proud.

Ugh, I hate that sentiment so much! Honestly, letting kids win does not teach the right lesson, and if you do decide to let them win sometimes so they can get that \u201cI won high\u201d that is cool, but I also think it should be acknowledged. Like \u201cokay dude, I won the last seven in a row, I am going to go easy on you this time\u201d.

It would be ok to go a little easy on them though!\n\nThey're kids and it's a video game. I don't agree with the people saying it's bad for their development to let them win. It's ok to let them have a little fun. \n\nBut it can also be instructive. You can slow down a little bit. You can give some pointers during the match. If they're not utilizing the controls properly, maybe you can hit the breaks and help them figure it out, even if it means you lose that round. \n\nI think above all, let them have some fun. They probably look up to you and they would love some pointers from you.", "NTA, not quite.\n\nOn one hand, people have different beliefs about how to have fun with little kids while socializing them.  In my family, a parent of a little kid with special needs pointed out to the young-adult cousins that while it was fun for occasional visitors to let him change the rules mid-game so he could win, in general his parents were careful not to do that, because he needed to learn how to play with his peers and be a good sport.  \n\nOn another hand, you haven't told us anything about how you checked in with both kids to see whether they were still having fun, whether you gave them tips and pointed out that they were doing better than in the previous round, whether you offered to stop and let them play each other for a round and then you'd play the winner ... An adult should always do those things when playing with a kid, and I don't know whether you did.", "NTA, after reading the title and ages of the kids, I was ready to go the opposite, but you're young too, and your aunt could have said something at anytime. your aunt, on the other hand,  sucks", "NTA.\n\nLetting them win gives them unrealistic/unhealthy expectations about life and competition in general.\n\nClearly the crying proves that letting them win  is a mistake.

I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s a quote or not, and if so, who said it. But nevertheless, it goes true here. Yes, it\u2019s frustrating as all hell to continually lose all the time, but guess what, you practice. And your cousins need to understand that.

He says yay and then tells me good game. In this i also modeled how to lose where I dont get upset or angry I laugh tell him good job and we play again.

Of course I\u2019m good.\u201d (For the record, my brother\u2019s mottos in life are \u201cif you\u2019re not cheating, you\u2019re not trying\u201d and \u201csecond place is the first place loser\u201d.) They have beat me at Mario Party, but Mario Kart is not going to happen.", "Oohh my bad, you're right what an egregious mistake, its a lot better now that is little kids.\nDownvote me babes, I dont care. You just did this post so other teenagers would agree that you dont need to do any reflecting.\nYou are the big boy! Show them no mercy ever, that always makes for more fun.\n\nAh yes but Mario Kart is a life lesson, and these kids need to learn now. Good job! Dont ever change or consider alternative ways to interact w others.", "Wow. The child wasn't having fun or they wouldn't have cried. This is a child, not some teen gamer.", "Kids need the occasional confidence boost.  It's part of healthy development.  There are 2 ways you can boost their confidence.\n\n1. Let them win.  If you do this once in a while it works just fine.  If you do it every time then I agree with you, you aren't doing the kid any favors.\n2. Beat them, but don't beat them TOO badly.  What do you accomplish by absolutely demolishing a 6 year old?  Does that make you feel good?  You can beat them without making it a beating.\n\nIf you turn every game you play with little kids into an absolute beat down then they don't have fun.  If kids don't have fun they lose interest.  You want kids to be interested in a lot of different activities because that encourages healthy growth mentally and maybe physically (depending on the activity).\n\nI play soccer with my 3 year old niece.  When I win I win by 1 or 2.  Sometimes she wins by 1.  Do you really think a 3 year old is just so good at taking penalty kicks that she can hold her own with a 31 year old man?  Or do you think I'm just taking it easy on her so she can continue to have fun and develop a love for the game?", "When my daughter was learning the game I let her go a full lap before I would start racing to give her a head start. She still didn\u2019t always win but it gave her a more even playing field and gave me a bit more of a challenge. There are ways to be creative to give kids a chance when playing that doesn\u2019t just result in letting them win."]}
