They have two kids, my little cousins Willow (9) and Miles (6). My aunt recently bought a switch for the cousins, and they\u2019ve been getting obsessed with Mario Kart. \n\nAlmost immediately, the cousins challenged me, my parents, and my sister to a race. I had to go help my uncle with his car (I work part time at an auto shop and had promised to take a look at it) but said that I would be back to race once I was finished. \n\nAbout thirty minutes later, I came back into the house and my cousins met me at the door to get me to race, it was adorable. We sat down and played, and I smoked them. I\u2019m not particularly good at Mario Kart, but I\u2019ve been playing for a while and they just started playing two weeks ago. The cousins demanded a rematch and I obliged, then when I smoked them again, a re-rematch. Several rounds and not a single victory later, Willow was in awe of my \u201cepic skills\u201d, but Miles started crying. \n\nMy aunt, having heard Miles crying, came in the room and I explained the situation. My aunt comforted Miles while my mom took me aside. Apparently, there had been an unspoken agreement between my mom, aunt, and sister to go easy on my cousins and let them win. My mom called me a jerk for being \u201cso mean\u201d to my cousins. I told her that I didn\u2019t know, and she called me an idiot because apparently it\u2019s common knowledge to go easy on kids.

Kids don\u2019t need to win every time, and it is good for them to learn to lose gracefully. However if you\u2019re competing against elementary school age kids there\u2019s a point to notice that the kids are getting frustrated and figure out how to make the game fun again - instead of seeing who can win the 3rd time say, \u201clet\u2019s try to get all the power ups\u201d or \u201clet\u2019s try goofy track X\u201d or something. It\u2019s not about intentionally throwing the game, it\u2019s about finding ways to meet kids at their level of ability and have fun with them. \n\nPersonal example: I was about 15 before I realized that when I was in elementary school playing nickel-ante poker with my uncles and cousins I actually sucked at poker, they kept me in the game by sliding coins to me every time they got up from the table to get a drink or whatever, telling me to play a few rounds for them. I got to hang out with the men and they got to have fun teasing me at the poker table and teaching me swear words. There are ways to include kids without stooping to outright throwing the game or humiliating them because they\u2019re less skilled.", "Nta. It's kind of an unwritten rule to go easy on younger kids, but no one should find you tah because of that (unless you were like, smack talking them lol don't do that).\n\nI do not let my kids win at Mario kart. My youngest gets sad sometimes. We cheer them up after, or show them how to be faster.", "NAH because you technically didn't do anything wrong but really, you should take it easy on little kids.\n\nYeah yeah little kids need to learn that you can't win them all but at the same time little kids need the occasional confidence boost and you absolutely destroying them in a video game isn't going to help with that.  Maybe you didn't have to let them win but at the same time you could have maybe not beaten them quite as badly.", "YTA \n\nYou don\u2019t \u201c smoke \u201c 6 years old who just got the game.

I wouldn\u2019t feel too bad about it, but in the future, I might not just absolutely relentlessly cream a six-year-old over and over. Yes, there is a legitimate argument to be made against over-praising a child. There is also a legitimate argument to be made about letting a little child have a mastery experience, especially when they have tried repeatedly.", "NTA\n\nNo one told you, you didn\u2019t know.

Kids don\u2019t need to be winning all the time. Letting them have a few seconds before you react yea, letting them win, no. That way when they win they feel proud.

Ugh, I hate that sentiment so much! Honestly, letting kids win does not teach the right lesson, and if you do decide to let them win sometimes so they can get that \u201cI won high\u201d that is cool, but I also think it should be acknowledged. Like \u201cokay dude, I won the last seven in a row, I am going to go easy on you this time\u201d.

It would be ok to go a little easy on them though!\n\nThey're kids and it's a video game. I don't agree with the people saying it's bad for their development to let them win. It's ok to let them have a little fun. \n\nBut it can also be instructive. You can slow down a little bit. You can give some pointers during the match. If they're not utilizing the controls properly, maybe you can hit the breaks and help them figure it out, even if it means you lose that round. \n\nI think above all, let them have some fun. They probably look up to you and they would love some pointers from you.", "NTA, not quite.\n\nOn one hand, people have different beliefs about how to have fun with little kids while socializing them.  In my family, a parent of a little kid with special needs pointed out to the young-adult cousins that while it was fun for occasional visitors to let him change the rules mid-game so he could win, in general his parents were careful not to do that, because he needed to learn how to play with his peers and be a good sport.  \n\nOn another hand, you haven't told us anything about how you checked in with both kids to see whether they were still having fun, whether you gave them tips and pointed out that they were doing better than in the previous round, whether you offered to stop and let them play each other for a round and then you'd play the winner ... An adult should always do those things when playing with a kid, and I don't know whether you did.", "NTA, after reading the title and ages of the kids, I was ready to go the opposite, but you're young too, and your aunt could have said something at anytime. your aunt, on the other hand,  sucks", "NTA.\n\nLetting them win gives them unrealistic/unhealthy expectations about life and competition in general.\n\nClearly the crying proves that letting them win  is a mistake.

I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s a quote or not, and if so, who said it. But nevertheless, it goes true here. Yes, it\u2019s frustrating as all hell to continually lose all the time, but guess what, you practice. And your cousins need to understand that.

He says yay and then tells me good game. In this i also modeled how to lose where I dont get upset or angry I laugh tell him good job and we play again.

If you do this once in a while it works just fine.  If you do it every time then I agree with you, you aren't doing the kid any favors.\n2. Beat them, but don't beat them TOO badly.  What do you accomplish by absolutely demolishing a 6 year old?  Does that make you feel good?  You can beat them without making it a beating.\n\nIf you turn every game you play with little kids into an absolute beat down then they don't have fun.  If kids don't have fun they lose interest.  You want kids to be interested in a lot of different activities because that encourages healthy growth mentally and maybe physically (depending on the activity).\n\nI play soccer with my 3 year old niece.  When I win I win by 1 or 2.  Sometimes she wins by 1.  Do you really think a 3 year old is just so good at taking penalty kicks that she can hold her own with a 31 year old man?

However, my view of nice does not include deliberately lying to kids, especially kids who trust me.

What if when you're 10-12 your parents didn't buy you a console and their parents didn't buy them a console? What if they had no interest in playing the same games as you?\n\nIt's dangerous to just assume that your very, very specific experience is expected of other people. That's exactly how we end up with people in OP's situation, where they didn't have the opportunity to learn this lesson earlier on and then are being reamed out because some other person happened to have perfectly aged cousins that had consoles and wanted to play the same games so they were lucky enough to have the opportunity to learn that lesson earlier.", "I mean, even dogs pretend to lose in pretend fighting against puppies\n\nShould dogs just dominate their puppies so they can get some easy wins?

If you don't ever get a chance to even get close, it's hard to actually learn much because your actions/decisions in the game aren't really connected to a tangible result. Maybe if you are competitive enough or invested enough in a particular game to practice, you get over the discomfort. For an adult, if you care to play a game you can usually practice in a single-player mode or with a friend who is willing to deliberately slow down and teach you how to play. And in a well-designed game there may be tutorials that are unobtrusive but informative. For OP's 9 year old cousin, it was probably apparent to her how she could get better or observe OP's skills, and she was able to have fun and aspire to play better. She was probably able to notice that even if OP was consistently winning, she was able to impact the outcome in other ways - successfully hitting him with an item or dodging one of his items, or playing better vs the NPCs. For OP's 6 year old cousin, I can imagine how he was probably stuck in dead last the whole time, occasionally getting trampled by items and carts. Frankly, 6 year old probably played a lot of games of Mario Kart where he didn't win in the two weeks they had it - often little kids aren't even sure what's going on and just have fun causing their character to move, and 9 year old might have even lied to him (\"12/12 means you've got a great score!\") so that she could focus on playing the game herself. This is like, standard gaming with young sibling behavior. However, I'm guessing that OP \"smoking\" them might have entailed a little bit of bragging - even if he didn't trash talk his cousins or anything like that - and probably shattered the illusion of being on an equal playing field for 6 year old. If 6 year old realized he wasn't even playing the game correctly, and OP and his sister kept playing, then 6 year old would feel like his actions were irrelevant and he wasn't really being included.   \n\n\nWhich like, I have totally had happen to me even as an adult when playing a fighting game for the first time with skilled friends. As an adult, I obviously can just decide \"that game wasn't for me, I'll play something different\" or practice to get good. Like with fighting games, the gameplay is more intuitive and fun to me so I'll just go on practice mode after getting \"smoked\" a few times - or just keep losing and get better by staying alive longer, doing more damage, and generally gaining more ability to stay in control. Or... my friends tried to get me into DOTA2 and I played one match and had an awful time, because my actions basically kept getting interrupted or had little impact on the game, and the non-friend random teammate trash talked me for not being a good enough member of the team. Like, I obviously didn't cry about it but I sure didn't feel like playing DOTA2 and I was mildly annoyed at my friends for pushing me to play something that has such an awful learning curve for someone who has never played that style of game, without having a plan to help me learn how to play or make the experience fun. But it's like whatever, I can just play a different game. However, those insights and options (and the ability to articulate them) are not available to a 6 year old - who just wants to play on his family's game console and have a fun time. 6 year old is going to be stuck in the frustrating \"unsure how to get better because I keep losing before I can even warm up to the controls and context\" experience, which is just objectively not fun for anyone.", "I think part of it is that he saw them getting frustrated", "My kids know I go for total annihilation when I play any game with them.
