They have two kids, my little cousins Willow (9) and Miles (6). My aunt recently bought a switch for the cousins, and they\u2019ve been getting obsessed with Mario Kart. \n\nAlmost immediately, the cousins challenged me, my parents, and my sister to a race. I had to go help my uncle with his car (I work part time at an auto shop and had promised to take a look at it) but said that I would be back to race once I was finished. \n\nAbout thirty minutes later, I came back into the house and my cousins met me at the door to get me to race, it was adorable. We sat down and played, and I smoked them. I\u2019m not particularly good at Mario Kart, but I\u2019ve been playing for a while and they just started playing two weeks ago. The cousins demanded a rematch and I obliged, then when I smoked them again, a re-rematch. Several rounds and not a single victory later, Willow was in awe of my \u201cepic skills\u201d, but Miles started crying. \n\nMy aunt, having heard Miles crying, came in the room and I explained the situation. My aunt comforted Miles while my mom took me aside. Apparently, there had been an unspoken agreement between my mom, aunt, and sister to go easy on my cousins and let them win. My mom called me a jerk for being \u201cso mean\u201d to my cousins. I told her that I didn\u2019t know, and she called me an idiot because apparently it\u2019s common knowledge to go easy on kids.

Kids don\u2019t need to win every time, and it is good for them to learn to lose gracefully. However if you\u2019re competing against elementary school age kids there\u2019s a point to notice that the kids are getting frustrated and figure out how to make the game fun again - instead of seeing who can win the 3rd time say, \u201clet\u2019s try to get all the power ups\u201d or \u201clet\u2019s try goofy track X\u201d or something. It\u2019s not about intentionally throwing the game, it\u2019s about finding ways to meet kids at their level of ability and have fun with them. \n\nPersonal example: I was about 15 before I realized that when I was in elementary school playing nickel-ante poker with my uncles and cousins I actually sucked at poker, they kept me in the game by sliding coins to me every time they got up from the table to get a drink or whatever, telling me to play a few rounds for them. I got to hang out with the men and they got to have fun teasing me at the poker table and teaching me swear words. There are ways to include kids without stooping to outright throwing the game or humiliating them because they\u2019re less skilled.", "Nta. It's kind of an unwritten rule to go easy on younger kids, but no one should find you tah because of that (unless you were like, smack talking them lol don't do that).\n\nI do not let my kids win at Mario kart. My youngest gets sad sometimes. We cheer them up after, or show them how to be faster.", "NAH because you technically didn't do anything wrong but really, you should take it easy on little kids.\n\nYeah yeah little kids need to learn that you can't win them all but at the same time little kids need the occasional confidence boost and you absolutely destroying them in a video game isn't going to help with that.  Maybe you didn't have to let them win but at the same time you could have maybe not beaten them quite as badly.", "YTA \n\nYou don\u2019t \u201c smoke \u201c 6 years old who just got the game.

I wouldn\u2019t feel too bad about it, but in the future, I might not just absolutely relentlessly cream a six-year-old over and over. Yes, there is a legitimate argument to be made against over-praising a child. There is also a legitimate argument to be made about letting a little child have a mastery experience, especially when they have tried repeatedly.", "NTA\n\nNo one told you, you didn\u2019t know.

Kids don\u2019t need to be winning all the time. Letting them have a few seconds before you react yea, letting them win, no. That way when they win they feel proud.

Ugh, I hate that sentiment so much! Honestly, letting kids win does not teach the right lesson, and if you do decide to let them win sometimes so they can get that \u201cI won high\u201d that is cool, but I also think it should be acknowledged. Like \u201cokay dude, I won the last seven in a row, I am going to go easy on you this time\u201d.

It would be ok to go a little easy on them though!\n\nThey're kids and it's a video game. I don't agree with the people saying it's bad for their development to let them win. It's ok to let them have a little fun. \n\nBut it can also be instructive. You can slow down a little bit. You can give some pointers during the match. If they're not utilizing the controls properly, maybe you can hit the breaks and help them figure it out, even if it means you lose that round. \n\nI think above all, let them have some fun. They probably look up to you and they would love some pointers from you.", "NTA, not quite.\n\nOn one hand, people have different beliefs about how to have fun with little kids while socializing them.  In my family, a parent of a little kid with special needs pointed out to the young-adult cousins that while it was fun for occasional visitors to let him change the rules mid-game so he could win, in general his parents were careful not to do that, because he needed to learn how to play with his peers and be a good sport.  \n\nOn another hand, you haven't told us anything about how you checked in with both kids to see whether they were still having fun, whether you gave them tips and pointed out that they were doing better than in the previous round, whether you offered to stop and let them play each other for a round and then you'd play the winner ... An adult should always do those things when playing with a kid, and I don't know whether you did.", "NTA, after reading the title and ages of the kids, I was ready to go the opposite, but you're young too, and your aunt could have said something at anytime. your aunt, on the other hand,  sucks", "NTA.\n\nLetting them win gives them unrealistic/unhealthy expectations about life and competition in general.\n\nClearly the crying proves that letting them win  is a mistake.

I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s a quote or not, and if so, who said it. But nevertheless, it goes true here. Yes, it\u2019s frustrating as all hell to continually lose all the time, but guess what, you practice. And your cousins need to understand that.

He says yay and then tells me good game. In this i also modeled how to lose where I dont get upset or angry I laugh tell him good job and we play again.

If you do this once in a while it works just fine.  If you do it every time then I agree with you, you aren't doing the kid any favors.\n2. Beat them, but don't beat them TOO badly.  What do you accomplish by absolutely demolishing a 6 year old?  Does that make you feel good?  You can beat them without making it a beating.\n\nIf you turn every game you play with little kids into an absolute beat down then they don't have fun.  If kids don't have fun they lose interest.  You want kids to be interested in a lot of different activities because that encourages healthy growth mentally and maybe physically (depending on the activity).\n\nI play soccer with my 3 year old niece.  When I win I win by 1 or 2.  Sometimes she wins by 1.  Do you really think a 3 year old is just so good at taking penalty kicks that she can hold her own with a 31 year old man?

It's not his fault the adults in his life conspire to lie to him and play dumb around him every time.\n\nI would apologize for upsetting Miles, and explain that while I didn't know I was supposed to lose, it's patently untrue I was \"mean,\" nor am I an \"idiot.\" I was literally being nice by playing with my much younger cousins.  However, my view of nice does not include deliberately lying to kids, especially kids who trust me.

It turn it on to give others a chance. \ud83e\udd23", "Yeah I\u2019m kinda mad an uncle didn\u2019t butt in mid game and whisper to op to \u201cgo a little easier on the kids ey?\u201d \n\nLike that\u2019s such a normal part of growing up. Getting mad at someone after the fact doesn\u2019t really do anything but make the perpetrator feel bad and guilty for not thinking about it a specific way.", "Your comment that familiarity with Mario Kart and casual mention of cars is a sign of a standard Western upbringing is waaay more offensive than anything you said before, lmao.", "Also notice that the 9 year old (which by name, I'm assuming is a girl) enjoyed the skills where as the 6 year old (assuming boy by name) cries. This feels like the son gets coddled so he's always made to win.\n\nI'd wonder if the daughter gets told not to win against him too...", "Several rounds and not a single victory against 6 years old? Nope, this is plain cruel and not much competition.\nDecent move was to help, give them handicap or play against both of them. Show some mercy. \n\nIf you can do something it doesn\u2019t mean you should.", "My friends smoked me at video games all the time and it just stopped me from actively trying when I played games that I wasn't already good at because I'd rather fuck up carelessly and not be upset because I know I didn't try than legitimately try, get smoked, and get frustrated. I did learn how to have fun when being absolutely smoked, but the life lesson of \"don't try new competitive things around other people in case you're bad,\" was definitely the ultimate take-home.", "\"My parents used to beat me sometimes and I turned out alright.\" \ud83d\ude44", "> Raising a thin-skinned generation. \n\nOh please, what a dramatic statement. Letting a kid win one every now and again isn't going to harm them.", "No it still isn\u2019t comparable.  I feel like you are being obtuse on purpose and that is fine, but I will see myself out.  \n\nI stand by what I said.  Kids shouldn\u2019t be allowed to win just because they are kids.  Games of any form should absolutely still be fun for everyone, and in this very specific case, OP is also still a child and understanding nuances of the situation will come with time and maturity.\n\nAssuming anyone would do what you said in a wrestling match is asinine.  Do people do that? Sure, assholes do.  This is not the same.  Have a day", "Oh, Monopoly for sure, but it was the third game to be soft-banned in our family. First two?\n\n* Risk\n* Axis & Allies\n\nWe never had a problem with Uno, but Hearts on the other hand...", "There are is literally an entire board game industry. There are thousands of boards one can go out and buy. Why do people insist on playing such an unbalanced game as monopoly which was literally designed to show how unfair capitalism is.", "I mean, there are non-video games, and outside of that, there will always be folks better than you at things, I think learning to deal with that is healthy. Dance, music, and sports are all things you mentioned, and some measure of performance through direct competition or otherwise is pretty common in all of them", "You seem very aggressive.", "Hero. \ud83e\udee1", "Well op didn't teach them. And you can teach them and not smoke them. And FYI, they don't need much help. That's the thing with video games. They are made to be intuitive. The more you play, the better you get. Sure you can show then stuff they don't know but most of the time, they will just get better by themselves. There is never a reason to kick their asses. You can win, sure but by a small margin. By doing that, they think they have a real chance and will really try to beat you. If they know that they have no chance, they will give up trying unless they are hyper competitive, and frankly that's not a trait uou want to encourage in kids.", "omg im not racing against little kids but this still sounds fun af", "Have you played Mario Kart before?\n\nIt builds in a handicap when you start falling behind.  Also, he was playing both of them at the same time by the sounds of things.  There's nothing cruel about beating people in Mario Kart.  Miles is in for lots of tears in the coming weeks because his sister is probably going to beat him. A lot.", "Oh stop. Not the same at all. \u201cEveryone gets a trophy! Everyone is a winner!\u201d That\u2019s how you all sound.", "Look, I'm not saying you'd hurt the kid when you're wrestling. But you could \"smoke them\" by pinning them instantly every time, but that's no fun, you have to adjust to their ability, make like they can actually wrestle you a little bit.\n\nI'll give another example that is a game. If you're playing hide and seek with a six year old, do you hide somewhere that they couldn't possibly find you? Up in the attic somewhere they couldn't get to even if they thought to look there? And then when they hide and you see their little feet sticking out from under the curtains do you \"smoke them\" and immediately point out where they are? Or do you play it up and loudly pretend to look around in a bunch of other places? Nobody is saying you just let the kid win easily every time. I agree that could have a negative effect. But it's pretty shitty to just beat a six year old mercilessly over and over. Yes the 17 year old is still a kid themselves, but a kid on the brink of adulthood and most teenagers have the tact to go easy on a child who is almost a third their age.", "There is teaching your kids that there will always be someone better and then there is, treating them like your equal and not giving them the encouragement they need yo become the best. \nI doubt Ronaldo would go to a primary school to talk and play with the kids and just beat them to a pulp because he can. Healthy competition should be between relative equals. There is a reason why kids don't compete against adults in anything.", "So a) I am a woman. B) I played video games from the start of them. I played everything from the various Mario's to final fantasy, to GTA or tekkan. I played online as well.  \nYou made no indication of gender. I used male because of your wording not because of the topic. It sounded male. And maybe yes I do think that generally mothers have more empathy, especially towards their kids. Using that as a way to deflect from your attitude is pathetic.", "That's the other end of the spectrum.  \n\nYou're on the end of 'dont let them win, don't go easy on them...they'll figure out how to cope.'\n\nI find your thinking just as crazy as everyone getting participate trophies.", "First of all I don't have children but if we would like to continue this discussion MAYBE you should take the time to see who you are replying to. Also sounded male? I'm sorry I didn't realize female and males don't speak the same language. Obviously you are more interested and boasting about parenting skills and ripping a stranger a new @$$ than I don't know the orignal post maybe? \n\nPersonally I don't care if you keep coming back for me to point out the obvious with your ridiculous backwards way of thinking. And still cracking up with the it \"sounded male\". Can't get over how absurd that sounds you are just another internet idiot who like to stir the pot because you are bored. Congrats, I have no life either so make sure your comment makes sense. Also for a female you sure are misogynistic, interesting never seen that one before... Thanks!", "So let them win? No. Learn to play or dont play."]}
