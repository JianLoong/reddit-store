My guess is she hasn\u2019t taught him how to properly maintain good hygiene + hormones at that age. My concern is that it\u2019s not BO that he smells like. It\u2019s poop. His hair is always matted and he has these awkward haircuts. I mean I know the guys hairstyles are questionable rn. Lol. \n\nAnyway, mom sends him in clothes that don\u2019t fit. He\u2019s dramatically putting on weight. He tells us that sometimes she doesn\u2019t get out of bed all day. When he comes to our house, I hear my husband tell him how to properly clean. He spends a lot of time brushing out knots in his hair. \n\nMy issue is I feel TERRIBLE because I get grossed out by my stepson when we first retrieve him. Like we have to actively air out his room when he\u2019s only in there for a few minutes. I\u2019ve asked my husband to check his underwear to see if it\u2019s a wiping problem. But it\u2019s not. \n\nOnce he\u2019s clean, I love having him around. He\u2019s such a good kid and an incredible son + big brother to our 5 year old son. I just feel like a wicked stepmother feeling grossed out. \n\nWe\u2019ve tried to discuss with him ways to take care of himself but it honestly sounds like he\u2019s on his own at his moms. She has a girlfriend that lives with them, but idk how much she helps out with stepson. I can\u2019t assume anything happening over there. All I know is what happens here. \n\nWe get him and he immediately showers. After the shower he just looks like a healthy happy boy. Fresh. \n\nMy heart is heavy on this and I feel like an asshole. Am I the asshole for thinking he smells so bad he needs to shower immediately? \n\nOh, also, my in laws picked him up this past weekend for a cousins birthday party and my mother in law texted us to say they could not take him to party as he came, because he smelled so bad and they actually showered him.

Start with documenting (date/time, presentation) everything and calling CPS for a consultation. He repeatedly shows up uncared for. Clothes are too tight. Does he have consistent food, is there low school attendance while in her care, can the school give insight if he is bullied, what is his presentation at school (matted hair, dirty clothes, etc). To smell so strongly adults need him to shower asap is neglect and perhaps just the tip of the iceberg.\n\nIf you do not consult CPS you will be viewed as being unable to assess his basic needs and you 'agree' with what the kid is experiencing (by CPS). Contact them ASAP. This issue is a priority so make it one otherwise you fail this child. Now is the time to consult records at school, medical appts (are they missed, tardy), does he visit friends and can you talk with the parents?  Do not take a passive position. Fight for him like you would your own child.  \\~ \\~ Remember how happy he is after showering? This is the life and smiles he deserves to experience all the time not just in your home. Yes, his mom may have an illness but that does not excuse her from basic parenting responsibility. Her laying in bed for days means she is not engaging him. Best to you all.", "INFO why are you and your husband allowing this neglect to continue? Has anyone tried discussing this with his mother? Has your husband tried to have the custody agreement amended?", "This child is having problems everywhere in his life. Can you imagine the ridicule and bullying he is facing at school.. if he is going. Have his father call and check on his son's attendance.\n\nThis child may not be asking for help right now, but his situation is SCREAMING for help. Please do what you can.", "NTA seriously get a lawyer involved document everything so you can get primary custody and mom can get the help she needs", "NTA but please do something to fix this situation. Your husband should apply for full custody. meanwhile document everything.\n\nIs there no water at her house? soap? does she do laundry? He may have to be taught these things in the short run. an 11 year old should be capable of doing their own laundry. If you are that smelly and put on smelly clothing after the shower you're still going to smell. Can you make sure to send him enogh clean clothing for the duration of his visit? Have him bring all the clothing back to your house so you /he/your husband can make sure everything is getting washed and dried properlly (some vinegar or baking soda will help to eliminate odors). Make sure he has deoderant (and even though I hate it - a little AXE or after shave may be in order. *a little*)\n\nAlso - 11 year old boys smell. even when they're clean and wearing clean clothing, teenage boys smell especially in the first few years.", "You know\u2026 you can call cps, and if he is happy in every other way, does cps where you are try to help a parent who os obviously suffering from depression? Have either of you talked to his mom and asked what is going on?", "NTA  This seems to be a problem that needs immediate attention.  That might mean him not staying at his mom's as much.  Maybe get him in to see a Dr who can also help explain the need for good hygiene. Maybe a therapist would help too, to discuss what's going on with his mom.  I know you feel bad, but it sounds like you have his well-being at the heart of this. \n\nEither way it sounds like someone needs to figure out what's going on at the moms house. It sounds like she has some things she needs to work on and it might not be healthy for him to be there as much (for now).", "NTA- I'd say get CPS involved, no child should be living in a condition where they REEK that badly. Something serious may not be happening at his moms house, however he is still a child and needs proper care, and it doesn't seem like he's receiving it.", "YTA for not calling CPS.", "YTA for not getting your lawyer involved or CPS that sounds like serious neglect is happening\nand you are allowing it.", "NTA I don\u2019t think you\u2019re the asshole, it sounds like his biological mother is. And is clearly living in squalor and not taking care of her son at all when he\u2019s there. It sounds like she needs to get her shit together before taking a child in in any capacity.", "Serious question, how can we document smelling bad? Or hearsay from SS? Like we have texts from mother in law that say he smells so she\u2019s gonna bathe him. But other than that- how can we? I love my stepson and want him safe- just how?!", "YTA- for not reporting the neglect of your stepson to a child protection agency.", "Report this to CPS.\nNo lawyer fees then.\n\nAnd at 11, he should be able to retain the cleaning/hygiene lessons. So why is this an ongoing problem? Has this been addressed? No access to showers? No running water? No soap?\n\nI suppose ESH fits best (minus the kid).\n\nMom for her neglect.\n\nOP / OP\u2019s H for not involving the authorities yet. And not sending care package with him to her house to help.", "NTA. It sounds like he's not being taken care of. Do you want to take him in? He needs help.", "Nta but you have to address this. There is a hotline for children\u2019s advocacy that can walk you through options. Maybe a consultation with a lawyer before making any decisions and work with the school when it resumes. If it is that bad I would call in a wellness check.", "NTA, but this is something your husband needs to be taking up with the courts. He needs to get custody removed from the mother. You two should work on documenting these problems and starting that process immediately.", "ESH except the child.\n\nYou should be keeping him full time. His mother clearly is neglecting him and instead of helping him properly your sending him back there!!!!\n\nYes he should shower if he smells like literal poo but you and his father as adults should be saying 'my child is living in an unsafe environment we need to take him in full time until his mother deals with her mental health issues!!!'\n\nStop sending the poor child back to that situation, call a lawyer and get an emergency custody order! Call adult services for his mother to get the help she needs and help this boy learn what healthy living is like so he will actually care if he smells like crap or not.", "NTA for making him shower but something needs to be done about him coming from his mother's house smelling that bad. If she has him more of the time than you do, I can only assume this poor kid is going to school smelling bad too (I know it's summer but he will eventually go back to school). How do you think THAT is going to affect him socially, mentally and emotionally? If you or his father cannot address this with his mother, then definitely call CPS. This child deserves better.", "NTA for making him shower. However, YTA for not calling cps and getting the courts involved. If he smells that bad it\u2019s the house that smells that bad. It seems like she has untreated depression and can not parent. His mother needs professional help and the kid needs his dad to step up.", "We aren\u2019t allowing it. They don\u2019t coparent. They parallel parent. They are like oil and water. They cannot effectively communicate about anything. At all. Ever. I have to be honest, she seems to love him. I\u2019m sure of it. Other than her gf, I think SS is all she cares about. We\u2019ve tried discussing flipping the schedules so we have him significantly longer, but she gets pissed off and says she has never heard of anything so insane. She will fight tooth and nail to keep our parenting to a minimum.", "Damn. This kinda put it into perspective. \n\nI did not think about socially and honestly ASSUMED she would be attentive for school. But if she\u2019s not attentive for daily life why would she pay attention for school. Shit.", "Unless they live someplace with very few people, CPS is unlikely to intervene if the only issue is hygiene. They REALLY don\u2019t like taking children as long as they\u2019re fed and not physically or sexually abused. \n\nThat said\u2026 poor hygiene is a symptom of sexual abuse in children. A common reaction to sexual abuse is for children to feel alienated from their bodies and/or try to make themselves as unpleasant to their abusers as possible by refusing to wash. It may not be that if this is the only issue OP is noticing, but it\u2019s worth having a serious conversation asking the son about how he\u2019s treated at his mother\u2019s.", "You know we have seriously thought about this. He seems healthy and happy in every other way other than his hygiene. His mom is extremely high conflict. She will drag us through all the legalities and bleed us dry of our finances. I\u2019m not saying money is more important at all but we have rent and mouths to feed. So we feel very stuck. Like it WOULD go in our favor (which is essentially in stepsons favor). But it\u2019s scary cause what IF she drains all of our resources and we all end up losing? Stepson included.", "Yes, document everything! Matted hair?...pictures, date/time, frequency. Why is this not happening? When your husband does not alert CPS then he is complicit; going along with the absence of care at this mom's house. This is serious cause CPS can determine the father is unable to recognize and inquire about lack of care at his mom's.", "Photos of his hair/ clothing would be a place to start", "Of course I wanna take him in! I tell my husband I\u2019m on board !", "ESH except your stepson for allowing this to continue. He is being at minimum neglected at his mother's house and it's his father's job to step up even if it means getting CPS and the courts involved. Since his maternal grandparents have noticed this too they might be allies here because it sounds like all of you are failing this child.", "Also is it perhaps not just a showering issue but perhaps a bedding issue as well? Like she\u2019s not changing his sheets enough?", "That's if you file and make it about your husband's custody agreement. If you involve CPS and the neglect is serious enough, they'll file and consume their own resources.\n\nBut surely an 11 year old is old enough to learn to shower on his own. Does she actually prevent him from bathing?", "I feel sorry for him. He is 11 and cannot receive basic care at his mom's? Have you consulted teachers, counselors...anyone at his school? If he smells with matted hair at your home what is happening at school? If school is closed it is a perfect time to sit with the principal and look at his student file. Your husband has legal access to this by law. Start building a case and consider your state's bar association for free counsel; they all offer it.", "Does your husband want to take him in?"]}
