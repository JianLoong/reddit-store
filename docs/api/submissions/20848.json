Start with documenting (date/time, presentation) everything and calling CPS for a consultation. He repeatedly shows up uncared for. Clothes are too tight. Does he have consistent food, is there low school attendance while in her care, can the school give insight if he is bullied, what is his presentation at school (matted hair, dirty clothes, etc). To smell so strongly adults need him to shower asap is neglect and perhaps just the tip of the iceberg.\n\nIf you do not consult CPS you will be viewed as being unable to assess his basic needs and you 'agree' with what the kid is experiencing (by CPS). Contact them ASAP. This issue is a priority so make it one otherwise you fail this child. Now is the time to consult records at school, medical appts (are they missed, tardy), does he visit friends and can you talk with the parents?  Do not take a passive position. Fight for him like you would your own child.  \\~ \\~ Remember how happy he is after showering? This is the life and smiles he deserves to experience all the time not just in your home. Yes, his mom may have an illness but that does not excuse her from basic parenting responsibility. Her laying in bed for days means she is not engaging him. Best to you all.", "INFO why are you and your husband allowing this neglect to continue? Has anyone tried discussing this with his mother? Has your husband tried to have the custody agreement amended?", "This child is having problems everywhere in his life. Can you imagine the ridicule and bullying he is facing at school.. if he is going.

Your husband should apply for full custody. meanwhile document everything.\n\nIs there no water at her house? soap? does she do laundry? He may have to be taught these things in the short run. an 11 year old should be capable of doing their own laundry. If you are that smelly and put on smelly clothing after the shower you're still going to smell. Can you make sure to send him enogh clean clothing for the duration of his visit? Have him bring all the clothing back to your house so you /he/your husband can make sure everything is getting washed and dried properlly (some vinegar or baking soda will help to eliminate odors). Make sure he has deoderant (and even though I hate it - a little AXE or after shave may be in order. *a little*)\n\nAlso - 11 year old boys smell. even when they're clean and wearing clean clothing, teenage boys smell especially in the first few years.", "You know\u2026 you can call cps, and if he is happy in every other way, does cps where you are try to help a parent who os obviously suffering from depression?

Maybe get him in to see a Dr who can also help explain the need for good hygiene. Maybe a therapist would help too, to discuss what's going on with his mom.  I know you feel bad, but it sounds like you have his well-being at the heart of this. \n\nEither way it sounds like someone needs to figure out what's going on at the moms house. It sounds like she has some things she needs to work on and it might not be healthy for him to be there as much (for now).", "NTA- I'd say get CPS involved, no child should be living in a condition where they REEK that badly.

Call adult services for his mother to get the help she needs and help this boy learn what healthy living is like so he will actually care if he smells like crap or not.", "NTA for making him shower but something needs to be done about him coming from his mother's house smelling that bad. If she has him more of the time than you do, I can only assume this poor kid is going to school smelling bad too (I know it's summer but he will eventually go back to school). How do you think THAT is going to affect him socially, mentally and emotionally? If you or his father cannot address this with his mother, then definitely call CPS. This child deserves better.", "NTA for making him shower. However, YTA for not calling cps and getting the courts involved. If he smells that bad it\u2019s the house that smells that bad.

They parallel parent. They are like oil and water. They cannot effectively communicate about anything. At all. Ever. I have to be honest, she seems to love him. I\u2019m sure of it. Other than her gf, I think SS is all she cares about. We\u2019ve tried discussing flipping the schedules so we have him significantly longer, but she gets pissed off and says she has never heard of anything so insane. She will fight tooth and nail to keep our parenting to a minimum.", "Damn. This kinda put it into perspective. \n\nI did not think about socially and honestly ASSUMED she would be attentive for school. But if she\u2019s not attentive for daily life why would she pay attention for school. Shit.", "Unless they live someplace with very few people, CPS is unlikely to intervene if the only issue is hygiene. They REALLY don\u2019t like taking children as long as they\u2019re fed and not physically or sexually abused. \n\nThat said\u2026 poor hygiene is a symptom of sexual abuse in children. A common reaction to sexual abuse is for children to feel alienated from their bodies and/or try to make themselves as unpleasant to their abusers as possible by refusing to wash. It may not be that if this is the only issue OP is noticing, but it\u2019s worth having a serious conversation asking the son about how he\u2019s treated at his mother\u2019s.", "You know we have seriously thought about this. He seems healthy and happy in every other way other than his hygiene. His mom is extremely high conflict. She will drag us through all the legalities and bleed us dry of our finances. I\u2019m not saying money is more important at all but we have rent and mouths to feed. So we feel very stuck. Like it WOULD go in our favor (which is essentially in stepsons favor). But it\u2019s scary cause what IF she drains all of our resources and we all end up losing? Stepson included.", "Yes, document everything! Matted hair?...pictures, date/time, frequency. Why is this not happening? When your husband does not alert CPS then he is complicit; going along with the absence of care at this mom's house. This is serious cause CPS can determine the father is unable to recognize and inquire about lack of care at his mom's.", "Photos of his hair/ clothing would be a place to start", "Of course I wanna take him in! I tell my husband I\u2019m on board !", "ESH except your stepson for allowing this to continue. He is being at minimum neglected at his mother's house and it's his father's job to step up even if it means getting CPS and the courts involved. Since his maternal grandparents have noticed this too they might be allies here because it sounds like all of you are failing this child.", "Also is it perhaps not just a showering issue but perhaps a bedding issue as well? Like she\u2019s not changing his sheets enough?", "That's if you file and make it about your husband's custody agreement. If you involve CPS and the neglect is serious enough, they'll file and consume their own resources.\n\nBut surely an 11 year old is old enough to learn to shower on his own. Does she actually prevent him from bathing?", "I feel sorry for him. He is 11 and cannot receive basic care at his mom's? Have you consulted teachers, counselors...anyone at his school? If he smells with matted hair at your home what is happening at school? If school is closed it is a perfect time to sit with the principal and look at his student file. Your husband has legal access to this by law. Start building a case and consider your state's bar association for free counsel; they all offer it.", "Does your husband want to take him in?", "NTA... try to make it matter of fact when he comes. Shower and fresh cloths. Your husband should continue with unjudgmental casual hyg instruction. \n\nIt would be best to get him out of the home.", "YTA That child is being severely neglected. Your husband needs to get in front of a judge.", "NTA for having him shower but there are several concerns here about the overall post. \n\nAs a mom of a now older teenage son, I do remember the years of struggle with hygiene, and it was specifically around that age 10 to 12, after that, he started to care what he looked like, and smelled like. \n\nAnd knots in the hair- my mom, who worked full time, spent many hours cussing and spitting while combing through my knots after a week or so expecting me to brush my own hair and then facing the rats nest that resulted when I didn\u2019t brush enough lol. \n\nSo to a certain degree I think this is a common phase, but there are some red flags here, one of which is why does he smell like poop? Is he not wiping correctly? That also can be common with younger children when they start using the toilet on their own, but is typically resolved by age 6 or 7 at the latest. Can you elaborate on that situation? If it is a wiping problem, what is his dad doing about it? If it isn\u2019t a wiping problem, why does he smell like poop? Do you have a theory? Is there a developmental delay involved? \n\nAlso, if the mom is spending all day in bed and is depressed, she definitely needs help. But also, does she work outside of the house, is she in bed on her day off, does she work nights and sleep during the day? Or is this truly a case of someone so depressed they can\u2019t get out of bed? First, can there be attempts to work with the mom directly or have other family reach out? Does he have enough food when he is there, does he feel personally safe when there? \n\nAlso, you say that you think the mom hasn\u2019t properly taught him to maintain hygiene but you say that you and his dad discuss hygiene with him, so you know he has been taught, regardless of who did it. So what is stopping him from showering there? Is there no running water or soap? \n\nAt first read, it does sound like a bad situation, receiving this child after he\u2019s been at his mom\u2018s house with dirty clothes that don\u2019t fit him, and smelling bad, with matted hair. But something about the entire post, and some of the explanations and attributions make me wonder if there is a lot of key information missing, or if this is a bit of a baiting post to say that the mom is terrible and you guys are great. \n\nAfter all, if he\u2019s dramatically putting on weight and not wiping his bottom etc at age 11, isn\u2019t that also his dad\u2019s responsibility overall? The mom is sending him over in clothes that don\u2019t fit, but I assume he gets sent back to her house in clothes that do if his dad buys him properly fitting clothes, so is she throwing those away? Sometimes kids grow so fast they suddenly don\u2019t fit well into the clothes that fit last week and a kid looks a little funky until you can restock their wardrobe. So is that what\u2019s happening here, or is she regularly giving no attention to anything?\n\nI\u2019m concerned about the calls to involve CPS without more information about what\u2019s going on and what is behind it. You don\u2019t mention any direct attempts to discuss with the mom or resolve these issues. Something just feels off.", "INFO: have you or more preferably your husband asked stepson (as delicately as possible) why he doesn\u2019t take a daily shower on his own when he\u2019s at mom\u2019s house? I mean he\u2019s not a kindergartener, he\u2019s old enough to shower by himself.", "I\u2019ve dealt with CPS as I am a teacher. I fear that they will say this is a life style choice. They really don\u2019t do much unless the house is completely destroyed and has toxic waste around the home.", "ESH \n\nIncluding posters that continue to recommend you contact CPS. Do not contact CPS unless you want your stepson to possibly end up in foster care. It\u2019s a long lengthy investigative process. Unfortunately, there is no guarantee that the findings will be favorable to the child. Your husband will also be investigated before a judge can decide if he will retain full custody. Again this is a very lengthy investigative process before a determination is even made that a case can be made. Pictures and your word are not even remotely enough. We\u2019re talking about six to twelve months of investigation before a case will be open and that\u2019s only if sufficient evidence exists.\n\nInstead you can petition the court for a Protection Order. If you care about your stepson as much as you claim then you should have no problem retaining an attorney to start this procedure and that should happen right now. \n\nYou can also file a motion for emergency relief. Again put your money where your mouth is and retain an attorney to do this today! \n\nIf you are going to contact CPS and insist that you want him to live with you then I would advise you follow through with the protection order and file a motion for emergency relief. \n\nDo it now OP instead of wasting time replying to Redditors. Your step son needs help now, not tomorrow. Make sure to find yourself a good attorney who is going to get on the ball.", "Has Dad explained how to wash EVERYTHING?? Getting in cracjs,folds,etc? If I were him I woukd be contacting a lawyer to amend custody and CPS. Take him for a proper haircut and clothes that he likes that fits.  Buy him some deodorant. I recommend Lume,they have body wash as well. Dad should also contact school and see what his attendance has been", "NTA for the specific question.\n\nBut Y T A (your husband more) for allowing this to continue. Go for full custody, call CPS, anything. That doesn\u2019t sound like a safe environment for him.", "For goodness sake take the kid to a doctor. It's as simple as that. Have him checked. If he reeks like that at 11 it's bound to get worse when puberty hits. Also refuse to send him back and reopen the custody agreement in court. YTA for not doing all of those. A shower is the least of your problems, nor is it a solution of any kind. Do you want him to be a social pariah?", "Info:  How long does he stay with his mom?  A week?  it sounds like more than a weekend visit.\n\nCan you get step son a Dopp kit  or a toiletries bag?  It really sounds like that don't have any soap or shampoo.

It doesn\u2019t seem like it based off your post. Why doesn\u2019t he retain the information you give him that showering and brushing his hair is important and go do it at his mothers? Does he own his own hairbrush that he can leave at or bring to his mothers house? Does he own his own soap and loofah/washcloth that he can bring to his mothers? Have you spoken to his mother directly about this? Has his father? What does his mother being depressed have to do with her sons personal hygiene when he\u2019s old enough to understand that it\u2019s an issue and old enough to understand how to care for himself and he\u2019s had you and his father to explain?

He is going to have all sorts of issues if this goes on much longer.", "Call now!!!! You\u2019ve wasted enough time.", "Something\u2019s gotta get done ASAP. That boy is living in squalor while all of the adults around him are either providing very minimal support or contributing to the problem. It sounds like you\u2019re concerned, but you guys REALLY need to do everything you can to get him out of there.\n\nHonestly, do you really understand what his quality of life is like right now? Has your husband ASKED him? There\u2019s a lot I don\u2019t know about the nuances of a situation like this, but it\u2019s insane to me that a stable life for him is RIGHT THERE but he\u2019s not getting the support he needs.", "I have reported neglect because a child would come cover in dirt, hair not brushed, and feces on his bottom, Every. Single. Day. They did nothing. Did you know, not having running water is considered a life style choice? I\u2019ve been told many of times. It wasn\u2019t until they landlord called after they left their apartment that they took it sort of serious. Even then the children are still in their care to this day.", "Do not get me wrong, it\u2019s worth a shot, but I think court is the way to go.", "i'd also suggest finding out the state of the tub/shower. Because if it's as gross as I think it may be, disposable hygeine wipes and dry shampoo can be utilised to stay fairly clean without having to get into a nasty shower/tub.", "Yep. No kid should be spending time in a house from which they regularly emerge reeking of sh*t.", "My first guess is hoarder home that has pets that poop and pee anywhere and never gets picked up. I can go 3 days with no shower and barely have BO. There is definitely more to it than not washing properly. \n\nThat kind of home hits you immediately and the smell sticks to you the second you get in. Hell, my dad was a lifetime smoker and my friends always said I smelled like smoke despite never having smoked a day in my life. After I moved out and then visited my parents, the snoke smell hit me right away and when I left a few hours later, sure enough, I reeked like a Marlboro factory and had to wash and change.", "This is bone chilling :(", "THIS!!", "Two poops, one wipe.", "CPS absolutely could get involved. If the house is nasty enough it's a failure to provide safe shelter case, and kids do get removed for that. And when there's split custody, the child is placed with the other parent unless there's an issue at that home.", "Yeah, unfortunately \"he smells\" is not enough for CAS to really get involved.\n\nThe kid is 11. He's not dumb. *Talk* to him. Where is the smell coming from? Is there visible poop at moms? When he showers at mom's (if he showers at moms) what does he do? \n\nStart sending him there with a basket of toiletries- soap, shampoo, etc and see if it helps.", "Even if there's a custody agreement, CPS can get involved for concerns of neglect and do a home visit?", "CPS absolutely gets involved if the house is in an unhealthy state or a child isn\u2019t bathing enough. I know of separate cases with either issue. It is child neglect.", "That isn't a thing", "When was the last time his bed sheets were changed there is what i wonder.  Teach him how to change the bed and then give him a clean set to bring home every time to be rewashed.", "Yes", "Oh my god. I didn\u2019t even think about that. That\u2019s horrible. You\u2019re right it could be a defense mechanism. Oh my god I\u2019m like sick right now. \n\nEditing this to add: the weight gain could also be sm as a response to abuse. I don\u2019t want to throw such a huge accusation around, but you need to get a handle on what\u2019s happening with your son. And your husband needs to get it together too. Bc this isn\u2019t normal. At a minimum, he\u2019s being neglected. At its worst, he\u2019s actively being abused. YTA for letting this drag on so long, honestly."]}
