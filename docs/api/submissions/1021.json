If she wants to drag this into legal actions, you do have prof that she didn't answer you at all.\n\nWhen situations like this happens, it is important to always have a contract between you two. I have been saying that a lot to my sister (who has been dog sitting and asked friends to watch her dogs). Always make sure to create a contract both signs. Money is involved and dates. So when one pulls a stunt like this, it would be less stress for the other party when doing the right thing. It doesn't matter if it is between family members or friends, always create a safety net for yourself.", "NTA Block her and take screen shots of all the times you contacted her about picking up the dog and also the now blocked Instagram account to show she was actively avoiding taking responsibility for their dog.

Look up the abandoned property laws in your state; if you had the dog one month (and it sounds like you did) without the friend contacting you, and in fact blocking you, you will be backed up by abandoned property laws in your state. \n\nLong story incoming:\nI fostered a cat for someone a few years ago because she had to move to a place where she couldn't have the cat. The cat lived with me for a year, and despite contacting her repeatedly, she never came to see the cat (she only lived 20 minutes away), never offered money for her care beyond the initial offer when I said I'd foster her cat, and she ceased all contact at a year, when she got married and her new husband bought three dogs. I contacted her repeatedly over the next six months; she would send my calls to voicemail, and when I texted she'd leave me on read and never responded. At that point, she had lived with us 18 months with NO visits from the girl and no contact for six months. I have a friend who is a lawyer and I asked him for advice; he told me that my state considers pets to be property, and that they are covered by abandoned property laws - he told me that after that first month that she didn't respond to my messages, the cat was legally abandoned property and I could do with her as I wanted. I decided I wanted to keep her - she was (is!) a sweetheart, she was used to us, and she got along with my other cat. I got the cat microchipped in my name and put her on my pet insurance policy. \n\nTwo months after this, at 20 months (8 with zero contact), the girl texted me telling me she was coming to pick up the cat that week. I ignored the text. She continued texting. I finally texted her back that the cat was now mine. She called; I ignored her. Her mother called later, and the only reason I answered is because I didn't recognize the number. The girl got on the phone after I told her mother about the law, and screamed that she was taking me to small claims court. I calmly told her that was fine, to please look up abandoned property laws in our state, and that I'd see her with my lawyer because I could prove I had attempted to contact her even past the point that I had to, and she had diligently ignored me. I could hear her mother in the background saying \"I looked it up, she's right,\" but the girl said she'd still take me to court. My lawyer friend said to let him know if I was served.  \n\nThat was 8 years ago. No summons ever arrived, she never took me to court and just blocked me on everything. Cat in question is sitting in my lap as I type. She's happy, healthy, and loved immensely by my husband and me (and my parents, and my in-laws, and my sister, and my friends...). \n\nPoint is, I'm pretty sure you're covered legally, the dog was abandoned at that point.

I could have read her the riot act on how stupid that was but I did not I did not want to be involved in whatever her drama is felt sorry for the kid though. \n\n4 hours later I told the friend I think it's time you go home I'm going to start cooking dinner and he said I can't go home because my mother's not there and I said how do you know she's not there and he said she is not there.\n\nSince then no kids allowed to play at my house unless I know their parent(s).", "Info:  well where were they?

Being that I was a kid it felt like an eternity and I remember it was pretty late when my mom and brother actually came to get me but in reality I don't know how long I actually waited.\n\nI remember being really worried that something had happened to them because usually my mom was better at answering the damn phone (this was late 2000s, so it was a landline, actually she's worse at answering her phone now that she's got a cell on her constantly lol) but we kept calling and eventually we got ahold of her. \n\nApperently since I was gonna be gone all weekend my mom decided to take my brother out to see a movie and knowing her they were probably out getting sidetracked all day so I'm not surprised they weren't home to answer the phone but as soon as she got home and got all the messages we left they got right back in the car and rushed over to get me. I think it was probably around 10pm when they finally got there and my mom and my brother both apologized profusely for not coming sooner, but they all helped me pack my stuff and I was sent on my way.\n\nI remeber one of the counselors gave me a badge for toughing it out for so long, at the time it felt like a real acomplishment but now that I'm older it really doesn't seem like it was that big of a deal. Anyway to wrap up my story my mom was pretty upset about not being there to help me sooner, and she spent the whole drive home apologizing and trying to cheer me up, and my brother told me he had a surprise for me when we got home. I must have been like 8 or so at the time so to me it all felt like a pretty big deal but when we got home even though it was pretty late and it was well after my bed time my mom let me stay up and hang out with my brother for a bit.\n\nTurns out his surprise was that they went to a game store while they were out and he had gotten a copy of Halo 2 and we spent all night playing it, which really cheered me up. My eye was also fine after a few days when the swelling stopped.\n\nAnyway TL:DR I was at a camp once and I needed to go home early because my eye was swollen and my mom wasn't answering the phone so I was stuck there. As soon as she got our messages she rushed over to get me and apologized for not being there when I needed her.\n\nSome people are complete trash for dropping their kids places and leaving them there but other times it's honest mistakes.", "Oh, don't worry, [he sues them too.](https://jezebel.com/a-new-york-dentist-has-sued-at-least-four-patients-for-1784280821)", "Our judge was excellent and fair, even still there's that fear in the pit of your stomach that maybe you forgot to fill out some piece of paper in the clerk's office or something like that that could screw you up. We definitely had a decent case for harassment after he called my wife's company and threatened to make them a party to the lawsuit if they didn't pressure her to settle the case. But we would have had to do that after the initial judgement, and by that time, we were just worn out and ready to move on.", "What the fuck?", "You sound like me and my cats. They ARE my children.", "Or, you could go back and edit the review with the details of the lawsuit...", "They\u2019re not just going to leave the kids with the person who called them because that person is letting the authorities know they are not willing to watch the kids and aren\u2019t necessarily safe with this person.

It seems like a shady way to try to dump their dog off", "NTA.  If she didn't respond to your attempts at getting ahold of you for 10 days, blocked you and ghosted you, you had every right to do this.\n\nShe took advantage of you, and that isn't right.", "NTA - had an old roommate who pulled that one me.  \n\nShe was only supposed to be gone for 2 weeks.  I told her that I would watch the dog while she was gone.  She didn't come back until 6 weeks after she said she would.

Emergencies happen and we totally get that. However, she literally abandoned her dog with you, blocked you, and hadn't properly trained her dog to begin with. I guarantee you part of that fee that they paid was also because the shelter had to work with training the dog too. \n\nAfter literally abandoning the dog, the shelter shouldn't have let her have him back.", "Feel horrible for the dog, but you\u2019re NTA.

My dogs are my babies. I love them to death. I struggle to not have them on vacations. I can NOT imagine ghosting someone for an ADDITIONAL 3 weeks after getting home.

She literally blocked you, and her husband ghosted you. If I were you, I\u2019d feel like they didn\u2019t want the dog anymore and just gave it to the first person that would take it. You never agreed to care for the dog long term, and they never asked you to care for the dog longer than originally agreed.", "NTA  Tell her to take you to small claims court and block her.  She left a destructive dog with you for twenty four days.  She probably had to pay the adoption fee because the dog isn't chipped and she doesn't have proof of ownership.", "\"You paid me for two weeks but didn't pick your dog up at the end of that two weeks. So you still owe me for the additional 10 days I watched your dog. This was not a negotiated additional amount of time, and you intentionally avoided contact (eg. Not responding and then blocking me) so there couldn't be a negotiated price for the time.\n\nSo either you expected me to drop your dog off at a shelter, in which case I don't owe you anything. Or you expected me to continue watching your dog, in which case you owe me minimum wage hours for the entire 10 days you were gone. That comes out to 240 x (minimum wage), so $1800+.\n\nI documented everything, especially my attempts to contact you after the agreed upon dog-watching period.

WHOA, it sounds to me that your \u201cfriend\u201d is about as awesome of a human being as her dog is a house guest.  \n\nReading through AITA posts it is easy to get acclimatized to people being entitled and awful to one another but this one jarred me so much that i vocalized that  \u201cwhoa\u201d prior to writing  it above.  I have had some awful experiences  watching people\u2019s dogs, children and homes over my 44 years on this planet but  I can honestly say that I have only had one person do me anywhere like this. I might post about it at some point but that is for another day.l.  \nYour buddy and her husband paid you to watch their hellhound for two weeks while they were on holiday but when the day finally came for them to retrieve their **Poo**dle (yes, i know, low hanging fruit but I couldn\u2019t resist), they ghosted and blocked you instead. Based on your description of this beast (I love dogs but DAMN) I am impressed that you held out as long as you did before taking it to a shelter. What really blows my noodle on this though is that when they sauntered back to get their pet TEN DAYS late, without an apology might i add, they had the gall to be angry at you for not \u201dwaiting a little longer\u201d and saying that they\u2019re going to sue you because they had to pay to retrieve their dog?!?!? You are a better woman than me because at the first mention of financial consequences I would be sending them an invoice for damages to my home, penalty charges for incontinece (and that lovely day that the dog shit on your freaking bed) , and triple the previous rate for each day that they neglectd to retrieve their dear pet from my home before I had no choice but to accept that they had abandoned that dog and, being that I am not interested in adopting this nightmare, took it to a shelter so they could find a new and hopefully better family.  Unless I missed something in your post you didn\u2019t ask for extra payment nor do you plan to counter sue, correct? You are most assuredly NOT an AH and that (former) friend of yours is damn lucky for it!", "NTA It sucks for the dog, but what did his owner expect? Legally, I don't know if you're protected or not. Have you considered calling the shelter you used and asking what their adoption fees are and what it includes? That way, if it does go to court, you know what she paid and can use that against her. They may even be able to give you information about her dog specifically, depending on their privacy policy.", "Not the asshole. She surrendered the dog by failing to show or communicate. She won't have much luck suing when she made all efforts to avoid you and you had no reason to believe she would return. Document all of it with dates, when you called, what action she did or didn't take, and keep phone records and screen shots.", "For real. Judge Judy would annihilate this person. And I'd love to watch it.", "Yeah if she sues (she won\u2019t) just file a counterclaim. Document all the destruction now while you can remember every little thing. It will create a clear, timely record, and even without photos, you can testify to the facts and use the document to \u201crefresh your recollection.\u201d Your damage, the time spent dealing with it and sitting the dog will far outweigh any adoption fees. lol. \n\nOnly thing that niggles is the false pretense of saying the dog was \u201cstray\u201d (quick search didn\u2019t reveal a definition that arguably aligns with the situation).
