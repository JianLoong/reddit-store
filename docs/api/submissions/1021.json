If she wants to drag this into legal actions, you do have prof that she didn't answer you at all.\n\nWhen situations like this happens, it is important to always have a contract between you two. I have been saying that a lot to my sister (who has been dog sitting and asked friends to watch her dogs). Always make sure to create a contract both signs. Money is involved and dates. So when one pulls a stunt like this, it would be less stress for the other party when doing the right thing. It doesn't matter if it is between family members or friends, always create a safety net for yourself.", "NTA Block her and take screen shots of all the times you contacted her about picking up the dog and also the now blocked Instagram account to show she was actively avoiding taking responsibility for their dog.

Kill shelters don't just stick the needle in any old dog and call it a day- its usually in the case of dogs with severe behavioral issues or if they're sick and not getting better. Any shelter worth anything would try to have a dog go to a foster home if they don't have space.", "Agreed. She's a terrible pet owner whose long term neglect of the animal is obvious from his bad behaviors.\n\nI'm just laughing at OP trying to say that the \"friend\" paying adoption fees is any different than buying the dog.", "Didn\u2019t think about the working from vacation aspect. But I still question the blocking. I have blocked people before without explanation but if someone was taking care of a pet for me I wouldn\u2019t do it. What if something happened to the pet and it needed to go to the vet? I wouldn\u2019t expect a pet sitter to pay for my pet\u2019s vet bills.", "There are no laws in the US forcing vacation time. A lot of people get no paid vacation, most that do only get one or two weeks. Even without paid vacation though most employers will allow people to take time off. \n\nHowever taking time off almost always require advanced notice or making a request for a specific time period off and it\u2019s expected that you return at the end of the requested time. So scheduling a two week vacation and then suddenly changing it to four is almost never allowed. \n\nThe exceptions to the above are for medical reasons. Sick leave is also no usually paid but it can be as long as a person needs it to be.", "IF you get vacation days at all, it can depend on the company. Usually it's about 2 weeks from what I've seen and the longer you work at the company the more time you get off. But rarely do I see people get a month vacation unless they have a really really good job. ETA - OR unless they've been working at the business  for a long time. At my job you have to be working for them for I think 10 years before you can get 4 weeks vacation. I could be wrong on that though.", "[deleted]", ">and abandoned the already abandoned dog.\n\nYou cannot abandon something that isn't yours and you have no responsibility to. The dog was abandoned at OPs place, that did make it a stray so there was no lying on OPs part. This wasn't OPs dog, OP had no obligation to it, and they went above and beyond at that point already.", "Plus OP would need the dogs shot records for a kennel to take it in.  I doubt her \"friend\" left that with OP.", "Totally agree. The difference is that, should the parents return, they would get in touch with the authorities, and, maybe, have the baby returned to them. What happens here is that they could possibly never see the dog again, what if the dog was put down in the shelter for fighting other dogs? What if someone else adopted it? That is a very crappy thing to do, specially if you also like dogs, and don't see them just as things or property... The dog here could be even out down, it's not his fault that his owner is so selfish.", "It may be a cultural thing, then. I would try not to abandon a baby, or a dog, to the system. I would be pissed as hell, of course, and I would try to make sure that the friend faces the consequences of their actions,but, without harming innocents. In this scenario, the innocents would be the baby or the dog. If I could put a complain with the authorities, while making sure that the baby/dog is taken care of by a loving family, and that it won't be put down, if I had a guarantee that they will not put it down in the foreseeable future and that he will be taken care of, not just caged in a dark room, that might be different...", "Yeah, definitely, OP's friend is clearly a selfish and dislikeable person.", "I went out of town for work for a week and missed my dog so much. My spouse would video chat with him and me, it was really cute because he heard my voice but didn't smell me so he would go around the house looking for me. We had to put my shirt by the phone so he understood. \n\nWe are our pets whole world, I could never imagine doing something like this. I sometimes think about what my dog would think if I got into an accident or something. It breaks my heart.", "My bf and I are the same with our dog, we feel terrible every time! He has anxiety and misses us so bad when we are gone. Even if someone is staying at our house with him he waits by the window and doesn't eat :(", "Precisely. The friend and her equally dirtbag of a husband should never be allowed to have an animal ever.", "sadly he didn\u2019t since the \u201cfriend\u201d had to pay a fee to get her poodle back.", "Anyone can sue anybody doesn\u2019t mean they win but it\u2019s a pain in the but to defend yourself if you don\u2019t save info.", "I see you with that reference", "It's concerning how many people read a summary of the same story with one detail changed and think it's a different story. I'm hoping it's more to do with skim reading and language barriers than a lack of comprehension.", "i think they're referring to the friend's choice to abandon it", "Not all shelters are worth anything and some just kill so they don't have to clean the cage in the morning. THankfully there are less and less of them all the time. But using a shelter as a boarding facility is a bad idea.", "Idk where you\u2019re from, but where I live \u201cno-kill\u201d means literally just that: they don\u2019t kill any animal that just walks through the doors. Only terminally ill and extremely aggressive animals.  We don\u2019t have \u201csanctuary\u201d options here.", "No, that's not true.  Certainly not in the states.  \"No kill\" means they do not euthanize healthy animals.  And they are very difficult to get into for that reason", "I don\u2019t think this person has the pet\u2019s needs as a priority if she paid for two weeks of boarding for a four week vacation, friend.", "I mean, we need to clear it with employer in advance too, but having 4 weeks off work and then be away on a trip for 2 of those is pretty normal in most of Europe afaik, and OP might live in a country with humane labour laws.", "She shouldn\u2019t have to do any work to give someone\u2019s animal back. She was already doing them a favor. They blocked her", "Then maybe they should've called OP and told them that they were extending how long they would be gone by 17 DAYS so that they could figure something out together. OP also mentioned in a comment that it was a no kill shelter, so the dog wouldn't have been put down unless they were very sick. I love all animals, but I probably would've done the same thing if my \"friend\" just abandoned her dog with me and then ghosted me. A dog owner like that deserves to have someone else adopt it.", "I get that but OP wasn\u2019t able to continue caring for the dog without there being harm to OP. I\u2019m that case the best scenario would be to find a no kill shelter and drop the dog off. Or report to the authorities for abandonment. I\u2019m all for not harming innocents but you can\u2019t carry the weight of the world on your shoulders. If it\u2019s harming you mentally, physically or your property than you have to make a different decision.", "Well, you also happen to be a fucking asshole as well, who is arguing in bad faith. Who cares that OP hates the dog. It is a shit dog, but she did her job and took care of it for the agreed on time AND then some. If the dog is put to sleep it is absolutely on the, \"friend\" because she went out of her way to ignore OP for nearly 2 weeks. If she cared about the dog, she would've gotten back as fast as she could or at the least replied to the messages, but clearly she didn't. \n\nOP is NTA, but you, the \"friend\" and the \"friend's\" husband certainly are.", "Ahhh ok", "Ohhh ok\u2026I see now.  Thanks for the note!", "whatevs. I\u2019d explore all options before dumping a dog at a shelter. Y\u2019all are weird", "Yes, definitely, the blame here is on the owner. The audacity to ghost OP after she is taking care of their dog, is beyond me. Of course, this friend should have done things differently. It may be right, though, that this behaviour shows that friend is a bad dog owner and the dog is actually better with other people. if we were to accept that this means that friend is bad for the dog himself, then, yeah, I see your point. Seems over the line for me, I would keep the dog while filing a complain for abandonment and, when they returned, be sure to only hand back the dog once they paid the extra expenses and after made sure that indeed the dog is properly taken care of with them... I have a soft spot for dogs, though, I my not be objective here...", "This is the AITA sub.  OP asked if anyone thought she was the AH, and I do.  If OP didn't think she was the AH, she wouldn't have posted here.  This is not the \"validate my feelings\" sub.  So I think OP is the AH, and gave my reasons for so.  THIS IS AN OPINION SUB.  You are free to have your opinion, and I'll have mine.  The dog owner may be as big an AH as OP, but fuck, OP is a huge AH, also.  She got rid of the dog because she was being vindictive, and that is an AH move.  I love how people on here think is perfectly acceptable to have put the dog in danger and then absolve OP of any responsibility whatsoever.  Fuck that, OP should have gone the extra mile to track down the owner or put the dog in a kennel.  Not just drop it at a shelter.  OP had lots of other options, and she chose the worst one.  So say what you want, but OP is still the AH.  Luckily the dog was fine.", "All the friend had to do was stay in contact and this wouldn't have happened. OP is NTA.", "If someone abandons their dog for a month! That dog should absolutely be adopted by someone else. OP's friend is clearly not capable of looking after a dog and should never be trusted with one!", "An ABANDONED dog.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHaving it adopted by someone else would have been a great outcome. And it was a no kill shelter.", "Ten days before the alter drop and then another week before the friend called so we are looking at 18 days more like."]}
