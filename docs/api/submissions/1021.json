You said you waited 10 days, then it took 7 days after that for her to contact you? So she believed you had her dog for 17 extra days??

What was her reason for telling you two weeks and then being gone for over four weeks? What was her reason for not responding and blocking you? Why did her husband block you?\n\nSo much about this story doesn\u2019t add up.", "They probably make her pay for the boarding time. If not, people would figure our real quick that they could get \"free boarding\" by having someone turn in their dog as a stray and then someone else pick him up again as their owner.", "NTA. You waited 10 days longer than the time you agreed to watch the dog. You tried to reach out to her and her husband and received no response.

Slam dunk case in small claims court, if you ask me.\n\nBlock them on all social media, your phone, your email, and your life.  They are users.   They just wanted an extra 17 days without that terror.", "NTA. She knew her dog was a terror on 4 legs.

She told you that you'd be petsitting for two weeks, after that time was up you tried to reach out and she blocked you. You waited 10 days, heard nothing from them, and then did what you felt was in the best interests of yourself and the dog.", "NTA- if this is real. But please make sure you DID NOT drop the dog at a no kill shelter. because even if you don\u2019t like him, he shouldn\u2019t die. block her right away also", "NTA. She abandoned her dog.

NOPE, these people just want their pets when convenient and are happy to dump them on others when not.", "__NTA__\n\nFirst of She abandoned her dog after the 2 weeks agreement. You kept the dog 10 more days until you turned to a shelter. It doesn't matter if she paid you, she only payed for the 2 weeks and nothing more.\n\nSecond: She ghosted you and she ghosted her own dog. You tried making contact and she __BLOCKED__ you. If she wants to drag this into legal actions, you do have prof that she didn't answer you at all.\n\nWhen situations like this happens, it is important to always have a contract between you two. I have been saying that a lot to my sister (who has been dog sitting and asked friends to watch her dogs). Always make sure to create a contract both signs. Money is involved and dates. So when one pulls a stunt like this, it would be less stress for the other party when doing the right thing. It doesn't matter if it is between family members or friends, always create a safety net for yourself.", "NTA Block her and take screen shots of all the times you contacted her about picking up the dog and also the now blocked Instagram account to show she was actively avoiding taking responsibility for their dog.

I'm leaning toward NTA because you tried to reach her about her dog and she wouldn't respond.

However, even vet clinics don't necessarily follow that rule and end up holding on for 10 days or more.  OP waited 10 days PAST YOUR AGREED PICK UP TIME.\n\nYour failure to execute BASIC COMMUNICATION is why you had to ADOPT (not purchase, don't be stupid) your own untrained piss pet back. At best you spent $50.\n\nMaybe next time you could use an actual boarding facility, but that requires vaccinations and guess what, if you did the same thing to them, they would be charging you DAILY for the overstay and you 100% would be responsible for paying the entire bill.\n\nLook at it this way, your dog got free boarding for 10 extra days and it was only a $50 pick up fee from the shelter.
