I hate him.  More than anything else in the world.  He wasted years of my moms life, and knowing my pictures are on there using used for that legitimately makes me want to throw up.  I hate him, I hate him, I hate him.\r  \n\r  \nHe was arrested a few years back for \\*photos\\*  and luckily a little over a year ago my mom received word from his brother that he died.  Of what IDK but praise the lord Hallelujah.  I cried tears of joy when I heard  that.  I\u2019m not asking if I\u2019m the asshole for that because I know I\u2019m not. But he had a daughter a few months older than me and she was a total daddys girl, absolutely loved him.  His sister said he never hurt his kid but I don\u2019t know.  Anyway I ran into her shopping and I said hi, she said hi back, she asked what I was doing I told her I was working as an electrician, and she told me she just got her masters in counseling, and is working in the local prison working to council prisoners.\r  \n\r  \nNow she spent all that money, all that time, all that energy into getting her BA and masters, something I never could because after my mom told me what he did I could barely concentrate in school and had to drop out so I never got the chance to go to college and only went to trade school a few years back after living with my mom until I was 27\u2026 and in stead of making up for what her dad did, she\u2019s choosing to coddle criminals and say its not their fault and thier mothers should have hugged them better and fuck off.\r  \n\r  \nAnd I even asked her, why is she choosing to help criminals and she told me, \u2018I don\u2019t know if you heard but my dad went to jail, and the conditions were deplorable and she wanted to cry (because ya know, rapists deserve tears) and she wanted to help and \u2018oh its sad in this country we choose punishment over rehabilitation.\u2019  And Idk why that part made me snap but I told her, \u2018so you think your dad could have been rehabilitated before he died\u2019 and I instantly saw her get all teary and she started some, \u2018I know my dad did bad things, but he was still my dad\u2019.  And I went \u2018yeah and your dads in hell right now for fucking kids\u2019 and she just told me to fuck off and walked away.\r  \n\r  \nWell she told her mom what happened, who then told her ex\u2019s brother, who then told my mom who then told me she understands I\u2019m angry, its why she left him, but I shouldn\u2019t take it out on her and I was cruel for what I said.  Sorry but no, shes choosing to dedicate her life to helping people like her dad, she gets no sympathy from me, and I told her I would prove it by posting here with a bet I\u2019d get NTA.\r  \n", "created_utc": 1692871034, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15zxgl0/aita_for_making_fun_of_someones_death_after_they/", "score": 16, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It\u2019s awful when someone abuses you and leaves you to deal with trauma that negatively impacts your entire life. It\u2019s even worse when other people try to minimize that to make themselves feel better about someone they cared about. It\u2019s understandable that you would feel angry hearing her try to defend her dad and focusing on his experience in prison rather than the harm he caused to get there. You could have handled the conversation better, but you have no obligation to pretend to feel anything different about her dad than what you said.\n\nAt the same time, even if her dad didn\u2019t directly abuse her like he did you, she was most likely traumatized by her dad going to prison when she was a kid. Working with prisoners may be her way of trying to make sense of what she went through. She gets to decide her career path and focus, and you also don\u2019t have to hide how her dad negatively impacted your life.", "NAH. I\u2019m sorry for all that happened and it\u2019s completely okay and understandable that you feel all sorts of hate towards him and joy that he died. But it\u2019s a delicate emotional topic to talk about with her. There\u2019s so much room for way healthier communication instead of being upset against each other for all sorts of feelings you still feel about the situation. I wouldve said ESH because of unhealthy communication of the both of you but tbh I think yall are scarred and try your best to deal with it but it makes you clash.", "YTA.  Worse, you're being mean and vindictive on someone who is in no way responsible for her father's actions.  \n\nI was with you up to:  \"*in stead of making up for what her dad did*, she\u2019s choosing to coddle criminals and say its not their fault and thier mothers should have hugged them better and fuck off.\"  She is under absolutely no obligation to \"make up for what her dad did\" to you or to anyone else who he may have hurt.  \n\nWhat is more, you are trading in ignorant stereotypes of what trained counselors / therapists / psychologists do by claiming that they \"choose to coddle\" criminals.  In truth, by being a therapist, she is trying to make up for her father's behaviors.  She's focusing on the time when \"people like her dad\" get released from jail; through her work, she may help them not hurt anyone else in the way that her dad hurt you.\n\nYour mom is right: you've been hurt.  But she didn't go far enough.  You need therapy to learn how to manage the rage and anger that are controlling you.", "NTA. Sure she's not responsible for what her dad did, but her showing him any bit of sympathy makes her the asshole.", "Firstly I'm really sorry about what happened to you - no child should suffer that.\n\nSecondly NTA for how you feel about him but YTA for how you acted towards his daughter.\n\n>Now she spent all that money, all that time, all that energy into getting her BA and masters, something I never could because after my mom told me what he did I could barely concentrate in school and had to drop out so I never got the chance to go to college and only went to trade school a few years back after living with my mom until I was 27\u2026 and in stead of making up for what her dad did, she\u2019s choosing to coddle criminals and say its not their fault and thier mothers should have hugged them better and fuck off.\n\nShe doesn't have to make up for what her dad did - she was a child herself when this happened and she wasn't complicit in what happened. It's really unfair of you to hold her to account for his actions and expect her to repent for them. \n\nShe does not have to work in a role that you feel is suitable - she is free to choose her own.", "YTA. I'm not saying this as an insult, but damn, you should be in therapy. It's understandable why you're lashing out, but you are absolutely lashing out and you're letting your pain drive you. It's not your fault, but you could be a happier person if you started to deal with that pain.", "YTA. You're not hurting the dead criminal. You're hurting the innocent living.", "YTA - she was not your abuser, and taking your anger out on here, and using her grief against her makes you an YTA ... I am sorry you where abused, but it sounds like you need to get help, to better cope with what happened.", "YTA (but I get you did it from hurt rather than maliciousness)\n\nSHE didn't hurt her, her father did\n\nHe's dead, what he did, to you and to others, is 100% wrong, but you can't hurt him, so you took it out on someone else", "NTA.  She didn't enjoy her reality check.  It was her who was lacking empathy.", "Nta  of course", "YTA, but only for what you said to her, not for how you feel.\n\nThere is a much better way of approaching things like this. For a start, asking if she knew what he was in prison for and saying that you were a victim of his would probably have got you an actual conversation than going full on \"he fucks kids\" (something you haven't said there is evidence of either!)\n\nIt sounds like he was by far the biggest AH in this story, but what has the daughter done? Is it so wrong to want to fix a broken system? She has experience of that system, whether he was guilty or not is kind of irrelevant to her experience", "YTA, you're attacking the daughter, not the dad.", "NTA. You voiced your opinion based on what you experienced.", "YTA you were abused so in turn you turned into an abuser. So the cycle goes on and that's how, in so many cases, families are indeed  responsible for creating monsters.\nYou are bitter about your childhood, rightfully so, but if you have to turn your anger towards someone, how about you turn it towards your mother. She was the one who allowed that monster to be around you for so long. This girl did nothing to you and clearly her experiences were different from yours.", ">She could have helped victims\n\nExactly. \n\nNTA\n\nYes, she deserves to have it taken out on her because she made the morally bankrupt choice to support and defend predators and criminals who have destroyed the lives of children. You don't get a pass for that. \n\nMaybe this will be your wake up that there are a lot of people in this world who don't have, and were never taught to have, a moral foundation and they prove it in their comments on this post. \n\nIf this were not true, those who hurt children would get the death penalty, in every state, in every country, without fail or question. The fact that that isn't true is proof that our world is currently a cesspool. And Evil never sees itself for what it is. It wraps itself up in \"open mindedness\" and false \"compassion\" and narcissistic \"empathy\" to feel \"righteous\". It will never admit to being Evil. \n\nThe truth hurts. Her dad is in hell for fucking kids. Sorry, not sorry. If she had any compassion or real empathy she never would have spoken to you knowing it would harm you. She would have either walked away or only spoke to you about inconsequential things and moved on. We don't blame her for her father's actions. But approaching you--a Victim who was deeply harmed--and spouting that bullshit was cruel. Purposefully cruel to you, to (as I stated above) hide her evil behind narcissistic empathy and self-righteousness.", "YTA, don't forget it was her father who did all this to you, not his daughter, you see her crying and you don't cut it, you continue.
