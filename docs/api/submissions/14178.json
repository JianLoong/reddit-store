He may soon find out that a month is no time at all to organise a family vacation, aside from obvious bollocks of un-inviting you, then re-inviting you *via your mom*. Fuck that noise. If he wanted there HE should have been the one to re-invite you since the last time you spoke about it was him kicking you out of it.", "NTA.

What is it with people getting married and getting all pissy when they aren't the only thing people talk about! \nI'd have done the same thing.", "NTA. You have the right to not go to a wedding in general. You\u2019ve stated you have a rocky relationship with your brother. It\u2019s not like you two were really close and for no good reason you decided not to go. You were also uninvited 6 months before the wedding and then reinvited.", "NTA, he uninvited you then didn't even have the balls to re-invite you himself, it's totally possible he didn't really intend to re-invite you and your mother was just hoping that when you showed up he would accept it.

So let me get this straight, you get uninvited 6 months before wedding then reinvited just 1 month before and it\u2019s in another country?? But you\u2019re the one at fault for deciding to just not go? I know I shouldn\u2019t be laughing at this but the ENTITLEMENT of some people is crazy.
