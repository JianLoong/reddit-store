And honestly, this went in the opposite direction of what I expected. Sounds like he wanted to show you off. Instead, you went with a more professional appearance. I think you made the right call.  And if he has expectations, he should have mentioned it before the event.", "NTA. As long as you weren't wearing something inappropriate for the venue, he has no right to comment. That's just mean. I would have had the same response, except I would have told him to shove my wardrobe and his promotion up his ass. He owes YOU an apology.", "NTA.   \n\n\nHe didn't tell you about any dress code.\n\nHe flipped out over something inconsequential.\n\nHe's judging your style and self-expression.\n\n  \nThis seems like 100% his fault and his problem.", "NTA-this is not the post I was expecting...usually it's they want to dress however they want without taking into consideration the event taking place.", "NTA. \n\nIf he didn\u2019t like it, he should have said something (although it\u2019s not his call what you wear).\n\nYou made an extra effort for him and whether you got it right or wrong in his eyes, he should\u2019ve appreciated it.", "Not the way I thought this would go, but NTA.\n\nYou tried to make your best effort to make the event about him and also kept in mind that the military is a bit more conservative in terms of style. That's a very thoughtful thing to do.\n\nIf he had a problem with what you wore, for whatever reason, there was a way to address it that would've been respectful - and this absolutely was not it. He could've mentioned that he loves your usual outfits and maybe in the future, could you wear those to any other promotion events?\n\nI mean, almost any other way would've been better rather than telling you that you looked like an old man and other disparaging things when it should've been very clear that you were trying to make an effort for him.", "NTA. He could of asked you why you decided on that outfit BEFORE you went out. He waits how many days after. I\u2019m not saying he should police your clothes but if he can\u2019t bring it up before you leave that\u2019s on him. I constantly have to tell my husband his clothes don\u2019t match or the shirt isn\u2019t dressy enough for the event or too dressy. He often over dresses for events. But I won\u2019t wait until after to address it.", "NTA it seems like you put effort to match your style to the event. I feel like there is an underlying thing here on his part, most guys don\u2019t really care about the outfit of the girl their with unless it\u2019s revealing. I suppose if you feel this issue will come up again you guys can give each other \u201coutfit passes\u201d then can be cashed in for important events where you pick out the other persons attire but if this is just a one time issue than that would be too much. \n\nIf he really hates your pants ask him to buy you new ones.", "NTA - he is being a jerk", "NTA\n \nOne, you shouldn\u2019t have to run your outfits by your husband, if he\u2019s not cool with it that\u2019s not your problem. I respect you wanting to not out-show him at his event, that\u2019s very adult of you. But you should wear whatever you\u2019re comfortable in, especially since he apparently likes your usual style.\n\nTwo, if he had so much of a problem with what you were wearing that night, he probably should\u2019ve said something before you got to the event, assuming you went together, being husband and wife, and whatnot?", "NTA. Why are you married to someone who tears into you about what you wear? You were dressed appropriately and he's being an AH.", "**NTA**. He obviously has a voice since he was able to complain a few days later, so why wasn't this discussed beforehand? That was the time to say something. In my opinion, he should have just let it go since he didn't say something to you when you had the opportunity to do something about it.\n\nDid he have reason to believe you would have had a problem with him requesting that you wear something in your usual style?\n\nHaving said that, if you feel your response was childish, trust your own instincts over internet strangers. I do think that this whole issue could have been avoided if he had just spoken up when he had the chance, so at the very least your response was understandable.", "NTA even with dropping the \u201cdon\u2019t invite me\u201d comment while you were upset. He didn\u2019t communicate properly with you. Sounds in general like you both could work on your communication with one another.", "NAH. He didn\u2019t communicate. That\u2019s not your fault.", "NTA\n\nActually, spouses of military members are expected to dress a certain way. When I got commissioned as an officer, I was given a book to give to my spouse, so he would know what was expected of him. He was disgusted that anyone would tell him what to wear and how to act, so he threw the book away.  He was kind of a jerk, thus the reason why he is an ex!", "NTA, whatever\u2019s going on is 100% your husband\u2019s problem and he owes you an apology. \n\nYou clearly were trying to be considerate - ie, cause no harm and support your husband - and he was rude and immature in response. That\u2019s an awfully shitty way to treat someone you love doing something to support you. Think about what dynamic you want in your marriage and whether this behavior is acceptable.", "So I have a lot of family members in the military and the military definitely tends towards conservative. I absolutely think you did the correct thing to tone down your look for this ceremony. NTA.", "NAH - you were trying to be respectful, and he was disappointed because you didn't dress like \"you\".  Next time you're worried about what to wear, just ask if you should wear something different and communicate with each other.\n\nBefore everyone starts ripping on me, I am in no way suggesting she needs his approval about what to wear.  This happened because OP changed her style of dress to something atypical.  I'm simply suggesting that next time she finds out if a style change is necessary instead of making assumptions.", "I don't think anyone is the asshole here. I think you both have to work on your communication though. Since you are a military spouse you impact his career. it sucks but it's true. How you dress and act reflects directly on him. I know you know this so you wore toned down clothes and makeup. He needs to communicate what he wants specifically for these events. If the role on that base is to be feminine and wear a cocktail dress for these events he needs to state the expectations. As you tried to respect him for this event I doubt you have any trouble acting any role he needs. It sucks that you are a pawn in his success and have to be in a certain mold in order for him to move forward but I'm sure you would do what it takes for your family to succeed.\n\nIf I were in your shoes I'd put it on him what and how he expects you to act on these events. I will say, if he was in almost any other sector I would say he has no say but certain careers are dependent on the likeability of your spouse. People wouldn't trust a pastor if you met his wife in a designer crop top and hot pants cursing every other word. The good part is that you are both still young and have time to work on both of your life goals. Just make sure you both voice your expectations and make sure they are realistic and fair for each other.", "What was wrong with what you wore? Because it was pants instead of a stupid skirt or dress?", "You're too young to be married. \nThis is ridiculous. I can't believe you typed this out for people to see. \n\nYou're too young to be married. \n\nGood luck!", "NAH.  Sounds like he loves you for who you are, but did a bad job expressing this as the issue he had with you changing what you wore.  You tried to tone things down for his job and reacted poorly when he admitted why he didn\u2019t like it.\n\nAll in all it was just bad communication. It happens, you learn from it then  make it better next time.", "I think the issue here is he's upset that you went out of your way to change your style and look different from the person that he loves. He was expecting his wife to show up and to him he may have felt like a different person showed up. Your not exactly TA but just for future reference keep that in mind. He obviously loves you the way that you are and how he sees you from day to day and he wants everybody else to see you in the same light.", "NTA - He sucks , wear what you like", "[deleted]", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Coming from experience,  learn how yall can communicate the most effectively,  even on stuff like this, and I promise it will make your marriage all the better.
