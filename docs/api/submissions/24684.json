{"id": 24684, "submission_id": "15rmpjm", "title": "WIBTA for selling my unused engagement ring without telling my SO?", "selftext": "My (F35) partner (M34) and I have been together for over 5 years and largely have a good relationship.  We have discussed marriage and we do want to get married eventually when we get settled in a home of our own. A couple of years ago, we had a serious discussion and decided we would begin making loose plans. I was excited and began researching engagement rings online. I found a design that I really liked and asked a local jeweler to design something similar. My partner was fully aware I was doing this at the time. I put a deposit down on a ring (partner aware), presuming my partner would help me pay off the balance. It was never brought up again and eventually the jeweler became impatient and demanded the money for the ring (totally fair), which I paid in full on my own. The ring was delivered to our house and now sits in a parcel in a cupboard since March 2021. \n\nI have asked my partner a few times about it and he says he is waiting to ask my father for permission. I thought this was sweet at the time, but now he has had countless interactions with my father in the intervening time and no once has he asked my father about asking to marry me. \n\nI turned 35 in the last couple of weeks and it brought on a lot of feelings of missed milestones. I know it's silly but I can't help but feel duped. I understand if he isn't ready and that's fine, but why let me go through with designing and paying the deposit for my dream ring if he has no intention of asking me? I am also super embarrassed because I told two of my very close girlfriends at the time that 'we' had bought a ring, and now, over two years later, nothing has happened. \n\nTherefore, WIBTA if I took the ring parcel from the cupboard, sold it online without telling my boyfriend? I wouldn't even want to wear it now even if he DID ask because I associate the ring with embarrassment. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR: two years ago my partner and I discussed marriage, I bought a ring at the time with my own money (he was aware), now I want to sell the ring because I am upset and embarrassed that he still hasn't asked me.

You own it, and (as you stated in a comment) you don't want it anymore - even if you got engaged now, this particular ring has too many negative emotions associated with it for you to wear it.\n\nHowever, overall in this situation, I'm leaning ESH. Your partner because he is either procrastinating about taking these next steps in your relationship, or outright misleading you about his intentions. You because you went and bought yourself an engagement ring after a discussion where you agreed to \"begin making loose plans.\" That sounds pretty manipulative, like you agreed to \"loose plans soon\" but then started actively investing in \"concrete plans now.\"\n\nI think you need to strongly consider\n\na) whether your negative feelings are all about the RING, or are some of them about your PARTNER, i.e. do you believe you can genuinely get on the same page with him, let go of your (very understandable) hurt feelings that he hasn't proposed for so long after you thought he would, and continue a happy relationship with him;\n\nb) whether Being Proposed To is something you really need in order to feel loved and chosen, or if you're willing to let go of that idea if it turns out the proposal itself is an obstacle (it's possible your partner is enthusiastic about marrying you, but not about asking your father's blessing and/or planning the perfect proposal).\n\nAnd then, once you know how you really feel about those two things, talk to your partner, be extremely honest about how you feel, and really listen to what he says. Compromise on the stuff you honestly can, and don't compromise on the stuff you really need in order to be happy.\n\nUnless the answer to a) is, you're too disappointed and resentful and even if he proposed tomorrow you'd always stay upset or insecure because it took so long and you had to badger him into it.

(that's just the name of an engagement ring I hear advertised on the radio all the time)", "He can always save it and have it reset in a new ring if he remarried. Or even swap for a different ring that doesn\u2019t have a bad memory attached", "If it's at that point I'd think the focus should be on whether or not she wants to be in the relationship, not whether or not she wants to sell the ring", "Wow, did you do it yourself?", "She said her partner was aware of the commission every step of the way. He knew she went to a jeweller and paid a deposit and the ring was delivered to their house.", "It would be an engagement ring if she was given it as a gift in anticipation of marriage. As of right now, it\u2019s a pretty ring she designed for and paid for herself. She should just keep it and enjoy it for what it is instead of making it into what it is not.", "I never knew people ask for permission.

I would have proposed either way though", "Before we got married, my husband took me to the mall to look for a ring.  \nI didn't  find anything I liked.  I asked to go to a pawn shop and found a ring \nI loved.  A few hundred compared to thousands.  I'm not a cheap date, I just like old jewelry.", "Yes, exactly.", "Nope, paid a jeweler to do it.", "That would still be over the line for me. It\u2019s only the last few decades that it\u2019s been called \u201casking for her father\u2019s blessing\u201d in order to make it sound less weird than permission. I still wouldn\u2019t like that either tbh. The only blessing required is mine and my partner\u2019s enthusiastic agreement. My parents aren\u2019t my keepers, especially not my father. Any amount of discussing it with my parents rather than me is already an undermining of my agency and I\u2019m not on board.", "I mean you do you. That\u2019s alright. In my case my fianc\u00e9 and I discussed the matter of marriage very often with a common goal in mind. So it was clear that I will propose, or she would if I take too long. Once I got the ring I talked with her parents about my exact plans. Like I said blessing from both her parents, not only her father. And no matter the answer, I would have proposed. It\u2018s really about shared excitement. At least in my case. Sure there are other families", "In my mind she would be the AH to sell it without talking to him first because he knows she bought it. Her wanting to sell it might matter to him too due to what it was ment to signify about their relationships which is totally his business.\n\nI didn't say she would be the AH for selling it. It belongs to her and she can do as she pleases with it. Just for doing so without telling him due to what it represents could cause issues for their relationship because of what it represents.\n\nIt's not contradictory at all, just more nuanced than you seem to be making it out to be.", "Yep yta", "I have a godfather take on this\n\nKeep the ring, leave the \"fiance\"", "NTA", "NTA.  5 years in relationship and 2 years started talking about marriage but failure to actually do the very simple thing of saying, may I ask your daughter to marry me?\n\nIt sounds like he is very comfortable with the girlfriend experience\u2026.and isn\u2019t looking to upgrade to the wife experience.\n\nAs a male, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s right at all.  He had has chance for a free ring and a wife.\n\nNow he can pay for the ring.  Or not.  At least then you will really know.", "NAH.\n\nThe hang-ups are your own. You're worried about a lot of things about the direction of this relationship. It is all quite understandable. I think you want to *do* something about this, and the ring is a physical representation of what's most bothering you in your relationship.\n\nYou say you have asked him about it, and understand he may be hesitant. The hard thing to do would be to be frank with him, tell him what you want, tell him that  you want a commitment or you may move on. Focusing on what to do about the ring, and not having that important discussion with him, seems like avoidance of the real problem.\n\nAlso: if it is *your* dream ring, why not keep it and, whoever you might marry, they can use it? If it has no tie, either in design or in financing, to your current partner, then there is no need to think of it as related to him.", "I just wonder... if you told him you sold the ring off...  not because you dont want a ring.. but because youd rather he be the one to give it to you.  \n\nMaybe he restarts the whole process..  where he finds a ring, talks to your father.. and askes you... \n\nall without your input......", "I would sell it and move on without him.", "Maybe deep down he\u2019d want to get married? Why? He all of the benefits without the legal paper. Maybe you need to rethink your relationship with him. By buying your own engagement ring tells me, you\u2019re trying to push him into something he really doesn\u2019t want!", "NTA. Honestly, I would use this opportunity to tell him that you're going to sell the ring. I disagree that you would be the asshole for using this as an opportunity to talk about marriage. And I am not saying this to try and be hurtful to you, but are you sure you want to spend the rest of your life with this guy? TBH, after five years, it's a bit sus that he hasn't done anything, making me think that maybe he was never going to. I can guarantee that your parents and friends are all wondering the same thing behind closed doors. It sounds like you deserve a lot better than this guy. Just sayin'!", "NTA. Stop wasting your youth on this person.", "NTA But what part of buying your own engagement ring made you think that he wanted to actually get married? Sounds more like he just went along with you because he didn't want to break up but he also didn't want to get married. Do whatever you want with the ring and I'm quite frankly I think you should sell it. Because if he proposes the least he could do is get you the ring! But if not getting married is a deal breaker then you need to tell him that.\n\nEdited to add: why don't you just wear it? I wear my aunts engagement ring on my other hand. It's gorgeous! Got three giant diamonds on it... Better than anything I had up till then. Except my wedding rings but I'm divorced so they're in a safe drawer lol point is wear the ring if you love it!", "If someone asked my father for his permission to propose, I would say no on principle. That being said, NTA.  He's stringing you along.", "It's sounds more like YOU discussed marriage and your SO isn't ready, otherwise he'd have asked. \nYou're NTA but I'd re-evaluate your relationship first before anything.", "NTA. Sell the ring. He didn\u2019t contribute towards it. A man who truly loves and cares for you, will not put himself in the position to lose you. This man may continue to live with you, but he will not marry you.", "NTA. you should sell the ring, buy some new shoes and purses and hit the dating pool.", "NTA\n\nBut why is marriage only his decision? You're a grown woman. He doesn't want to marry you, I'm sorry. Sell the ring and use the money to move on.", "NTA. Go for it. Maybe it\u2019ll be a wake up call for him. Honestly though, he\u2019s had enough time and this should be a wake up call for you.", "Unpopular opinion, and sorry in advance for the long post.\n\nHe may be putting it off because he feels as though his sentimental decisions are being made for him\u2026making it no longer meaningful to him. It sounds as though he doesn\u2019t have much control over his own proposal. The only control he does have is time. I don\u2019t know for sure but that was the case for my husband and I.\n\nA few things that he MAY be feeling:\n\nHe may not be excited to ask/give you the ring because there is no element of surprise. He won\u2019t be looking forward to your reaction and joy of seeing the ring for the first time. Because you already searched, designed, and bought your own ring. He may feel like you stole his thunder in a way. He may also feel you think he is incapable of picking something for you. Let me be clear this may not be the case, but I could see someone\u2019s ego potentially getting hurt by this. If it is the case, he needs to communicate this.\n\nHe also may have a chip on his shoulder that you paid for it and not him..again hurting his ego and potentially making him feel emasculated. I know this is sexist, and I\u2019m not saying I agree with it\u2026but it\u2019s not uncommon for men to get weird about that stuff because of toxic societal expectations. Again communication is key.\n\nNow that you know, every time he is with your dad there is a pressure put on him. He needs to make time with him alone so he can have a private moment with your father. Without feeling micromanaged.\n\nPeople will tell you to leave him, to sell the ring, to not sell the ring, that if he was going to do it he would\u2019ve, etc\u2026.however it may be a possibility that he just wants to make his own decisions regarding the proposal so he can express how much he loves you in is OWN way. Otherwise it may feel forced to him.\n\nAnother option: If you don\u2019t want to give up control over the proposal, you can propose to him. \n\nI don\u2019t know if you would or wouldn\u2019t be the asshole. I think it\u2019s obvious that the two of you need to communicate about the topic and what he does or doesn\u2019t discuss will give you guidance as to if you should sell the ring or not.", "NTA.\n\nYour partner doesn't want to marry you. To him, you are the right woman for now. You both are wasting your own time. If you wanna marry, be with a man who wants, loves and deserves you. This guy doesn't.", "NTA and he doesn't want to marry you. If he did, nothing could stop him, and he isn't even starting. I'm sorry.", "NTA but someone who has a desire to marry you would\u2019ve been all on board helping you pay for the ring and shown excitement. I\u2019m sorry love. I honestly think you should wear it on your right hand as a reminder of the love & thoughtfulness you deserve", "Why the hell would you buy your own ring?  When he\u2019s ready he\u2019ll ask and buy the ring.  Him not asking after many hints is a sign that he doesn\u2019t want to marry you.   Time to move on as ultimatums never work", "Nta. It\u2019s YOUR ring. Sorry this happened to you.", "well sister he didn't pay for it, so it isn't \"our\" ring, it's yours. Get that \ud83d\udcb0. hopefully dude grows a spine or figures out wtf he wants. I would've sold that thing yesterday if it had dragged out this long. I'm sentimental and would associate it with that embarrassment as well.", "Keep it and wear it on your right hand\u2026.", "Sell the ring. It's yours.\n\nNTA", "NTA \n\nYou can do whatever you want with your belongings. You paid for it, you can sell it.", "NTA But if you love the ring then why not keep it and wear it on a different finger as a ring you bought for yourself because you love yourself? Change the narrative of it.  You deserve a nice ring and you don\u2019t need it to come from someone else.", "I\u2019d leave the relationship entirely.", "I understand that he was aware the entire time you were getting the ring done and yes y\u2019all talked about marriage but I feel like you may have pressured him by going to get the ring designed and paying for it. That\u2019s his job. And I\u2019m thinking that might be the reason for stalling. I see people telling you to walk away and even though it\u2019s your right to do what you want with something you bought just give your partner the benefit of the doubt and have a conversation\u2026this is someone you love and want to marry", "NTA, it's your ring. Hopefully you can make some money back. He hasn't paid towards it.  I honestly don't think he wants to marry you, you got the design, did the payment, had it delivered and yet cickets for two years. \nHe is not going to ask your father, that's mostly symbolic these days. If he wanted to, he would have.", "oh honey. all you are is convenient to him. he doesn't want to marry you. you have got to let this man go.", "So 100000% this OP. \n\nYour boyfriend wants things to stay the way they are, he doesn't want to propose because then he has to give up on some future fantasy of \"meeting a girl he likes more\". Marriage is 'binding'. So in his mind you have a ring which means you have a proposal which means shut up. You selling the ring will go down poorly because he will think that is a step backwards - it means you're going to keep bothering him. It also gives him an additional excuse not to propose: \"Oh you sold your ring clearly you aren't ready to get married I'm not going to propose to you knowing that\". \n\nThe ring issue isn't the issue here. Put the ring in a safety deposit box, forget about it for now, sell it later. Instead have a serious, sit-down conversation with YOURSELF first. What does marriage mean to you, why is it important, can you be happy without it. Make these decisions first - there is no right answer. Once you know, you sit HIS ASS down and have a conversation. Tell him it is not fair to you to leave you hanging, that you cannot be his back-up plan anymore. That you have life goals and they are as follows, and the way he is currently behaving is getting in the way of these goals.\n\nTo be perfectly honest, there isn't a good excuse as to why he hasn't proposed yet. And by having the conversation, you are giving him effectively an ultimatum, and no one wants to be wed as the result of an ultimatum...\n\nSo, as sad as it is to think about, decide if you love him enough to be in an asymmetric relationship or not. Because if he loved you the way you deserve to be loved, he would have proposed since he knows how important it is, instead of making BS excuses ad infinitum. And if you realize you deserve to be loved equally, then remember that it is NEVER too late to give up on sunk cost and start over. \n\nIf you can find a good reason he hasn't proposed then fine, but at this stage in a relationship when he knows very well what you want out of life, the only reasons are red flags (he's already married, he's keeping his options open, he has massive debt he doesn't want you to know about, he's Batman / Spiderman and getting married would put you at risk of being kidnapped by villains, etc...). \n\nSorry", "I hope you recognize that he will never \u201cbe ready\u201d. If marriage is what you want, it\u2019s time to move on to someone else. He will always have an excuse. It\u2019s been 5 years. Most couples date 2-3 years before marriage. You don\u2019t need to own a home first. You don\u2019t need to have dad\u2019s permission when you\u2019ve been an adult for 17 years. You could try proposing to him, but it\u2019s time to be honest with yourself. You even bought the ring and he still made excuses. Marriage is not in the cards for him. \n\nSell the ring or don\u2019t- it\u2019s 100% your ring and you can do whatever you want with it. \n\nBut it\u2019s time for a serious discussion on the future of your relationship. Either accept it as is, or have a definitive cut off mark for moving on to marriage. \n\nNTA", "Treat yourself to freedom from a man whom does not plan to marry you. Good luck, sincerely.", "NTA.  Put it up on ebay with what you paid as a minimum price and send him the listing.  See if he takes the hint. Bring some cardboard boxes home from work too.", "Are you wasting time on this relationship? This feels like something you'd do before breaking up or at least when you'd want to move on. It seems disrespectful of your time and his own tbh to stick around for that long.", "My partner and I are happily unmarried. That works for us because we discussed it and agreed that we didn't want to get married.\n\nOP and her partner, by contrast, agreed that they *did* want to get married, and he even said he was just waiting until he could ask her dad,  which shows pretty clear intent even if it's kind of a weird custom in the 21st century. If he has changed his mind since, that's up to him, but since it remains meaningful to OP, it it now represents a significant incompatibility of goals at the heart of their relationship.", "You could reclaim the ring as dedication towards yourself and knowing what you want. It's a reminder of a difficult decision you made for your happiness.", "Oh man she'll run into him and his wife like 7 months after the breakup.", "This. I've been with my partner for 16 years, and I refer to us as \"happily unmarried\". We agreed early on that neither of us were interested in marriage, but if we were, we would've married each other. This works for us.\n\nBut OP and her partner aren't on the same page about this; at this point, it sounds like, he's stringing her along. Time to cut your losses and find someone who shares your priorities, OP!", "True but he didn't pay a dime toward it. He knew the rest of the money was going to come do and he did nothing.", "Still, even at pennies on the dollar, worth more than a \"meh\" sort of relationship? Something else to consider...", "Definitely", "Me too or the 4 other fingers on my right lol.", "It's not a diamond, so it not really going to look like an engagement ring.", "Maybe get it resized for a different finger and wear it on the opposite hand? Just a thought. She should definitely sell it if she wants to.", "Heck, my father basically told the first guy who proposed to me that.  Asking *him* was one of many (quite legitimate) reasons my dad was not a big fan of that guy.  He never interfered, but he was so relieved when we broke up, lol.\n\nHe adores my husband though!  My husband who among other great qualities, did not *ask his damned permission* to marry me.  Heck, like another poster here mentioned, we basically just had a conversation, there was no formal proposal either way - neither of us wanted that.\n\nYeah, not on board with the \"want to ask your father\" crap. \n\nAnd yeah, aside from that, this guy is so never going to marry OP.", "Well, hell. If you're interested in marriage, why haven't you asked him?\n\nAt least then you'd know if he's on board.", "At this point the only value in the ring in regards to resale is the stone(s) on the ring.  No one really tends to buy used engagement rings so the ring is bought by a pawn shop, stones are removed and the gold is melted down and added into a collection of other gold to be sold later.  That being said that $1000 dollar ring ya bought likely has maybe $300 of stone on it.  The remainder of the $700 was you buying the name.", "SHE kows that it is an engagementring, and SHE knows she bought it herself and is wearing it out of desparation without a proposal because she knows she won't get one.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNOT a ring that will make her happy.", "My dad would say the same thing. Especially since if I ever do get married, I'll be pushing 30 at the earliest.", "And good luck even getting the $300 in value back.  Most likely you'll get $100 total.", "Yup. The pawn shop has to make money to.", "*You* embarrassed *him?*  LoL!  No.  He embarrassed himself and, frankly, you.  You'd made your wishes on this matter quite clear and he decided he just didn't need to worry about any of the little lady's stated wishes.  Ugh.\n\nIt's bigger than some people may think.  He showed you who he was and how he valued you, and you listened the first time.  Very good."]}
