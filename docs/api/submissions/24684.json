{"id": 24684, "submission_id": "15rmpjm", "title": "WIBTA for selling my unused engagement ring without telling my SO?", "selftext": "My (F35) partner (M34) and I have been together for over 5 years and largely have a good relationship.  We have discussed marriage and we do want to get married eventually when we get settled in a home of our own. A couple of years ago, we had a serious discussion and decided we would begin making loose plans. I was excited and began researching engagement rings online. I found a design that I really liked and asked a local jeweler to design something similar. My partner was fully aware I was doing this at the time. I put a deposit down on a ring (partner aware), presuming my partner would help me pay off the balance. It was never brought up again and eventually the jeweler became impatient and demanded the money for the ring (totally fair), which I paid in full on my own. The ring was delivered to our house and now sits in a parcel in a cupboard since March 2021. \n\nI have asked my partner a few times about it and he says he is waiting to ask my father for permission. I thought this was sweet at the time, but now he has had countless interactions with my father in the intervening time and no once has he asked my father about asking to marry me. \n\nI turned 35 in the last couple of weeks and it brought on a lot of feelings of missed milestones. I know it's silly but I can't help but feel duped. I understand if he isn't ready and that's fine, but why let me go through with designing and paying the deposit for my dream ring if he has no intention of asking me? I am also super embarrassed because I told two of my very close girlfriends at the time that 'we' had bought a ring, and now, over two years later, nothing has happened. \n\nTherefore, WIBTA if I took the ring parcel from the cupboard, sold it online without telling my boyfriend? I wouldn't even want to wear it now even if he DID ask because I associate the ring with embarrassment. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR: two years ago my partner and I discussed marriage, I bought a ring at the time with my own money (he was aware), now I want to sell the ring because I am upset and embarrassed that he still hasn't asked me.

You own it, and (as you stated in a comment) you don't want it anymore - even if you got engaged now, this particular ring has too many negative emotions associated with it for you to wear it.\n\nHowever, overall in this situation, I'm leaning ESH. Your partner because he is either procrastinating about taking these next steps in your relationship, or outright misleading you about his intentions. You because you went and bought yourself an engagement ring after a discussion where you agreed to \"begin making loose plans.\" That sounds pretty manipulative, like you agreed to \"loose plans soon\" but then started actively investing in \"concrete plans now.\"\n\nI think you need to strongly consider\n\na) whether your negative feelings are all about the RING, or are some of them about your PARTNER, i.e. do you believe you can genuinely get on the same page with him, let go of your (very understandable) hurt feelings that he hasn't proposed for so long after you thought he would, and continue a happy relationship with him;\n\nb) whether Being Proposed To is something you really need in order to feel loved and chosen, or if you're willing to let go of that idea if it turns out the proposal itself is an obstacle (it's possible your partner is enthusiastic about marrying you, but not about asking your father's blessing and/or planning the perfect proposal).\n\nAnd then, once you know how you really feel about those two things, talk to your partner, be extremely honest about how you feel, and really listen to what he says. Compromise on the stuff you honestly can, and don't compromise on the stuff you really need in order to be happy.\n\nUnless the answer to a) is, you're too disappointed and resentful and even if he proposed tomorrow you'd always stay upset or insecure because it took so long and you had to badger him into it.

The conversation I had with my (now) husband was \"I love you and I want to marry you. It's okay if you're not there yet. But if you know I'm not your person, I'm going to ask you to let me go so I can find someone who does want marriage and kids. I want you to think about what you want and if you think or know that person is me, I'd like to work on a timeline of how to get there\". For us, my husband wanted to be done having kids by the time he was 40. That meant he had to have his first at 35 and I needed to get pregnant when he was 34. He wanted a house and marriage first, so he realized he needed to be married at 33. Weddings take 18 months to plan, so he needed to propose at 31 to get his preferred timeline. That was 6 months out, so we agreed to get engaged within 7 months. If he hadn't proposed, I would have walked.", "She designed and bought the ring, told her boyfriend she was ready for the proposal, and reminded him that she was waiting.

She knows it.", "Your answer deserves an award or whatever you can get on Reddit. \ud83d\udc4f", "In all honesty, this is probably the most accurate appraisal of the situation. We are different in that I am very career-orientated and thrive on working towards goals, whereas he is laid back to the point of being horizontal about life/ career/ etc. I can't help but feel resentful at times because I work really hard and I really do want us to progress to the next stage of life, as it gives me a sense of purpose to look forward, but maybe that is more of a 'me' problem. He is more of a 'live in the present' type person, which is a good balance for me and often he puts things in perspective. We are both healthy and gainfully employed, what does it matter if we don't get married at all. I suppose an engagement / wedding planning would really just be another goal for me to work towards, which is probably not a good  enough reason to get married anyway.", "The BF is straight-up lying to her--stringing her along with false promises.

He also has an idea what you like.\n\nYou also have to discuss with him milestone deadlines.... Either that or tell your dad to corner your BF and ask him when will he be asking for your hand (make it look like it was your dad who was asking abd you didnt know about it).

It provides additional perspective and context to the situation at hand - which, in my opinion, is a perfect miniature mirror of your, lets say, relationship dynamic. You need goals and projects, he is more laid-back and drifting through the present. Opposites attract and can complement each other, but if you lack alignment in life values, it can lead to arguments; failing that, to resentment and often passive-aggressive tug-of-war on important issues. \n\nYou also have your reasons to be resentful at times - I'd be too, if I'd have the impression my partner isn't working towards a goal I thought we shared.  \n\nIndeed I'd ask myself in earnest: \"What does it matter if we don't get married at all?\" - for some time at least, you agreed on getting married, now he seems to be dragging his feet.

However, OP could hold on to the ring and then have it re-made in the future if she and the partner do end up getting married, or if she leaves the relationship and wants to create something new for herself.

Early days in the relationship.  \nAround six months later, we went on holiday to Turkey with her mom, and there was some oohing and aahing at pretty rings in a jewellers shop.  \nEventually her mom basically pulled us both in there and we bought the rings, then we went to the hotel gardens and had a little photo-shoot with me down on one knee.  \nFrankly I barely remember there being a conversation, it was just a flurry of things happening with me barely having input on it and I found myself with an engagement band on my ring-finger and a beaming fiancee on my arm.\n\nThe reality was that while I was wholly onboard and into the idea of getting married, I was also going to procrastinate about \"The right time to do it\" from here until eternity because that's exactly the kind of stupid character-fault I have.  \nI'm eternally grateful to my MiL for cutting through the bullshit and making it happen.  \n\n\nI readily believe that OP's partner is shit-scared of doing the whole \"Talk to FiL\" conversation and making the engagement real, because that's exactly how I would feel in this situation.", "I think turning 35 was what has prompted a lot of these feelings to resurface. I have been wholeheartedly content in the relationship and we really are compatible in many ways. It's just that 35 is one of those birthdays that (especially for women) feels like you are entering a new stage of life (largely based on societal expectations of course).  Also, pretty much all of our friends are all married. Even HIS pals make remarks and jibes about us not being married when we are out sometimes, to the point of  them asking me or him point-blank, 'why hasn't X asked you yet?' I know they mean it lightheartedly, but every time he laughs it off I cringe a little inside, knowing that ring is in his bedside locker for over two years gathering dust.", "He needs to look into trading it. My husband was previously engaged, and he traded the old ring for a truck, and then turned around and sold the truck for more than the ring was worth a few months later. Mind you my husband is a mechanic, so he knows what to look for, can do the work to fix things up that need it, etc.", "Yeah I'd nope out of that relationship so fast! \n\nMy ex and I had talked a lot about proposals and things and I always said that I'd prefer a conversation about getting married rather than an actual proposal, but if a proposal was important to him, then I'd hate a public proposal, and would prefer something more intimate. He proposed in the middle of a really busy restaurant.\n\nI chugged my wine, grabbed my bag and walked out, thankfully we weren't living together, so the break up was easy.", "also agree about permission. i\u2019m already married so this is moot, but if a man did ever ask my father, he would say \u201cwhat are you asking me for?\u201d or something to that affect. such a strange, outdated tradition.", "Well, that's understandable. Even if events like specific birthdays are arbitrary, there is no denying the underlying feelings of a certain, lets call it, \"pacing of life\". You are in a committed relationship and would like to take it to the next logical step. Perfectly reasonable. \n\nRegarding \"societal expectations\": it is a two-way street, really. The society has certain ways in which things are done and there is something to say for the wisdom of the past - people have been doing things, for example marriage, this way for centuries. There comes your expectation toward society (\"this tradition of yours better be working!\") and society's expectation toward you (\"there better be some reason for doing things differently\"). If you choose to forego something that would be in the cards for you traditionally, you are trading that relative security and sense of purpose for a freedom and risk that things go south in a new and unexpected way for which no one is prepared. \n\nMy honest advice at this point is: talk to him. When even third parties are involved and he seems to continue skidding around the edges of the topic, bring it up in a way that demands an unambiguous answer (yes or no). Beforehand, try to let go of the built-up resentment (no easy task, I know) and be in the clear with yourself what the implications are regarding each possible answer. If he says yes, what should happen next? Is this tantamount to an immediate proposal, with the ring sitting in his drawer, your father's permission be damned? What if he says no?

Not in my world mate, my parents raised a woman who won't be subjugated or subservient, who won't pander to men and spare their feeling over my own.
