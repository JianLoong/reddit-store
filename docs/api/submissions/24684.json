{"id": 24684, "submission_id": "15rmpjm", "title": "WIBTA for selling my unused engagement ring without telling my SO?", "selftext": "My (F35) partner (M34) and I have been together for over 5 years and largely have a good relationship.  We have discussed marriage and we do want to get married eventually when we get settled in a home of our own. A couple of years ago, we had a serious discussion and decided we would begin making loose plans. I was excited and began researching engagement rings online. I found a design that I really liked and asked a local jeweler to design something similar. My partner was fully aware I was doing this at the time. I put a deposit down on a ring (partner aware), presuming my partner would help me pay off the balance. It was never brought up again and eventually the jeweler became impatient and demanded the money for the ring (totally fair), which I paid in full on my own. The ring was delivered to our house and now sits in a parcel in a cupboard since March 2021. \n\nI have asked my partner a few times about it and he says he is waiting to ask my father for permission. I thought this was sweet at the time, but now he has had countless interactions with my father in the intervening time and no once has he asked my father about asking to marry me. \n\nI turned 35 in the last couple of weeks and it brought on a lot of feelings of missed milestones. I know it's silly but I can't help but feel duped. I understand if he isn't ready and that's fine, but why let me go through with designing and paying the deposit for my dream ring if he has no intention of asking me? I am also super embarrassed because I told two of my very close girlfriends at the time that 'we' had bought a ring, and now, over two years later, nothing has happened. \n\nTherefore, WIBTA if I took the ring parcel from the cupboard, sold it online without telling my boyfriend? I wouldn't even want to wear it now even if he DID ask because I associate the ring with embarrassment. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR: two years ago my partner and I discussed marriage, I bought a ring at the time with my own money (he was aware), now I want to sell the ring because I am upset and embarrassed that he still hasn't asked me.

You own it, and (as you stated in a comment) you don't want it anymore - even if you got engaged now, this particular ring has too many negative emotions associated with it for you to wear it.\n\nHowever, overall in this situation, I'm leaning ESH. Your partner because he is either procrastinating about taking these next steps in your relationship, or outright misleading you about his intentions. You because you went and bought yourself an engagement ring after a discussion where you agreed to \"begin making loose plans.\" That sounds pretty manipulative, like you agreed to \"loose plans soon\" but then started actively investing in \"concrete plans now.\"\n\nI think you need to strongly consider\n\na) whether your negative feelings are all about the RING, or are some of them about your PARTNER, i.e. do you believe you can genuinely get on the same page with him, let go of your (very understandable) hurt feelings that he hasn't proposed for so long after you thought he would, and continue a happy relationship with him;\n\nb) whether Being Proposed To is something you really need in order to feel loved and chosen, or if you're willing to let go of that idea if it turns out the proposal itself is an obstacle (it's possible your partner is enthusiastic about marrying you, but not about asking your father's blessing and/or planning the perfect proposal).\n\nAnd then, once you know how you really feel about those two things, talk to your partner, be extremely honest about how you feel, and really listen to what he says. Compromise on the stuff you honestly can, and don't compromise on the stuff you really need in order to be happy.\n\nUnless the answer to a) is, you're too disappointed and resentful and even if he proposed tomorrow you'd always stay upset or insecure because it took so long and you had to badger him into it.

This part hasn\u2019t happened yet and OP seems to be expecting her boyfriend to disregard that previous discussion and just propose anyway, outwith the agreed timeline.\n\nTo OP: Selling the ring without telling him will very obviously cause problems when the time comes. If you really need the money then tell him about your idea of selling it. If it\u2019s not really about the money, tell him what it\u2019s really about.\n\nYou can\u2019t hold him accountable for you turning 35 and feeling like you haven\u2019t hit enough milestones for your age.", "He's just bullshittong you.Sell the ring,dump the boyfriend.Hes not sincere.", "Sell the ring and use the money to go and live on your own as this relationship is not going anywhere.", "Nta for whatever you wanna do with the ring - he didn't pay for it, its not really his business - but have you *talked* to him about this? \n\nYou *presumed* he was gonna pay for it, then when the jeweler demanded payment you just paid for it. Did you talk to him about your expectations? Did you ask him to pay you back? \n\nYou say you've asked him about it \"a few times\" and I hope it was recently. Did you talk to him about your feelings regarding him never proposing? Your embarrassment over buying your own ring and telling peoole about it? About where your relationship is going? About not wanting to be in it if it's not going anywhere? I think you're doing yourself a disservice here stewing alone in your feelings and expecting him to understand. He thinks everything is fine, right? Wouldn't it be better if he knew what was really going on?", "this is a good point, the reason I want to do it without discussion is that I know he will never ask about it and if I did mention it he would just tell me not to. He won't even miss it when it's gone, I know it! Meanwhile I will have the money to play with to either put in my savings or treat myself.", "BS. Any ring can be an engagement ring if they BOTH want to be married. You don't actually need ANY ring. He doesn't want to be married.", "He is not dragging his heels. They never made plans.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"eventually\"? That means \"maybe, some day\"  - not much more than a NO.", "At least not in THIS relationship. \n\nShe states that they \" largely have a good relationship\" - if THAT is the best she can say aboput it, there IS NO basis for a marriage. \"largely good\" - WHO would commit to THAT for the rest of their life?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThey are just both waiting for something to happpen, or for someone better to come along.", "I know, and it's not even diamond, it's a sapphire :(", "OP took it upon themselves to have a ring designed and made, while labouring under the assumption that their partner would pay (at least in part) for the ring. That doesn't make her partner an asshole at all - some people take longer with their life decisions, or want things to be perfect - the lack of communication here in honestly astounding. 'loose plans' does not equate to having an engagement ring specially made for yourself, it's just a loose plan, meaning nothing is set in stone", "He never said he wanted to marry her.", "Seriously why can't SHE propose? What a good point.", "The people saying this will call her the AH in two months if she proposes knowing he doesn\u2019t want to get married for \u201cpressuring him.\u201d Do not do this OP. He doesn\u2019t want to get married, which is his right, he\u2019s an AH because he lied and pretended your lives were going somewhere they were never going to. Walk away, do not propose.", "This is the answer. OP is allowed to want things for her life, including marriage. Those goals are now incompatible with this person. Time to move on, take the ring with you.", "[deleted]", "How is being excited about getting married and taking initiative manipulative? Nonsense!", "This makes sense, but if that's where you're at I'd ask if this relationship is even worth it. Imagine all the other money and time you put just to be with this man.", "This is fair, but the resale on jewelry, especially custom jewelry is pitiful so don't expect much.\n\nSee what it's worth, if it's disappointing  then you might want to hang on to it as an heirloom for your future kids/nieces/nephews etc. Just because he's been shit about it doesn't mean someone else won't appreciate it.\n\nAlso need to ask yourself where you see this all going. if he didn't choose to propose even after you sourced a ring for him then he probably doesn't want to.", "Use the money to move into your own place and find a new relationship with someone who is more marriage minded", "Treat yourself by dumping this guy and use the money to go out there and find a partner that actually wants what you want in life as this loser clearly isnt on the same page as you.", "But what is the point of deliberately not telling him about it? To get even?", "You are focussing on the ring to avoid facing the real issue in your relationship.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**The two of you have NO plans to get married, and you don't like that** (not even some timeline of doing that in the next 10 years, just an \"eventually\" - Which means: maybe, but probably not ... If it had been a yes, you would have at least a rough timeline.). - **IGNORE the ring, adress the real issue.** \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat are you waiting for? - it won't happen in the next 20 years. The situation was not right then, and nothing has changed. **There IS NO proposal coming. And selling the ring means you know it.**", "They didn\u2019t say it wasn\u2019t an engagement ring they said it isn\u2019t an engagement ring FROM the significant other. That\u2019s a very important word for context.", "Just start wearing it.  You designed it.  You bought it.  It's your ring.", "Ohh sapphire? Wear it! It\u2019s not an engagement ring. Your BF has no investment in this. Take charge and ownership of a beautiful ring you love that you designed for you, and wear the ring!", "I think if you liked it when you bought it and you still like it now then you should just wear it and enjoy it.", "That sounds beautiful! I love sapphire rings!  And how beautiful that you chose something nontraditional. \n\nSelling or keeping the ring doesn\u2019t have to be emblematic of your relationship with your SO, but it sounds to me like that is the case for you. I guess it just seems like there\u2019s lots more to dive into here than just the ring. \n\nI know engagement was the occasion for having it designed. But do you love it regardless of the occasion? If so, I\u2019d encourage you to view it as a gift to yourself. Something you\u2019d splurge on for yourself if you saw it available for sale. \n\nAnd then have a serious conversation with yourself about why you feel you need to sneak around about your very own finances. This is YOUR mfing money! You earned it! \n\nYou invested your money in planning for a future with your SO, which doesn\u2019t appear to be working out in the way you\u2019d hoped. Investors typically do their best to redeem what value they can from an investment that\u2019s not working out. Something to consider. \n\nAlso, I met my husband of 13 years in my mid-30s. I get what you\u2019re feeling about the milestone. There are men out there who will have your same values and cherish you. Wishing you all the best!", "If you don't want to wear it as a ring, see if it can be made into another piece of jewelry like a necklace", "Can you get it reset into a pendant?", "Wear the ring, and if he asks about it pull an Elizabeth I and tell him \u201cI am married\u2026 to England.\u201d Then go live your life and enjoy an awesome ring that you designed!", "But so has explicitly stated he wanted to ask her father's permission first.  He's had plenty of opportunities to do so.  Forcing the issue would make him resent her, and if after two years he is not ready then he needs to leave so she can find someone who will actually appreciate her.  Or maybe she should just leave instead.  Either way it sounds like they are both on different pages here.", "Two accounts?", "Yea I completely agree with this.\n\nIt\u2019s kind of an indication of what OPs life with him will continue to be like. And it\u2019s also okay to be at different stages, OP is ready for marriage and he isn\u2019t. It\u2019s important to also recognise when you\u2019re no longer compatible with someone.", "You're right about the resale problem.  My recently divorced son got back the ring from his ex and has been trying to sell it.  It's just an ordinary diamond, about a carat or so.  Pawn shops don't want it at all and jewelry stores are offering pennies on the dollar.  He hasn't tried online yet, but I think he's probably screwed.  The entire diamond industry is one huge scam.", "This is not about the resale value, this  gabout getting rid about emotional ballast.", "SELLING custom made proposal rings? Probably more: a short vacation, if that.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe resale value is really shit - you get material value for the metal, and not much for the diamonds. Cents on the dollar.", "Yes, which is why I said the lack of communication is astounding. \n\nOP has had the custom ring for 2 years, and commissioned it all by herself as far as I can tell. She took it upon herself to get this ring, with seemingly no communication with her partner.  \n\nThey are so clearly not on the same page, and something needs to change", "Yeah, he was stupid. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nShould have been generous and told her: keep the ring, I can not bear to pry it from your hand - I will take the car and the TV instead."]}
