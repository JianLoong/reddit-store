I don't know if anyone wants an update since I seem to be Reddit's villain of the week...\n\nBefore I continue with the update I'd just like to clarify, someone DMed me saying Danny posted an update that Lucy cheated on him. I don't know if Danny even has a Reddit, and while I haven't been able to find the post myself, I can confirm that's not true, someone is lying to cause further issues...\n\nAnyway I texted Danny and asked if I could sit down with him and Lucy to talk, they agreed and we met for coffee. I emphatically apologized to Lucy and then to Danny.\n\nWe spoke in detail about how in the past Danny has been similar to me in his attitude towards sex/PDA etc (not just our awkward high school fling, but every relationship he's had since) and how he used to be insecure when his ex girlfriends did anything that made him jealous. Over the years I've become really protective of him because he got hurt a lot.\n\nDanny explained that Lucy has brought him out of his shell and he's much more outgoing now (the opposite of how our friend group has just kind of always been) but his social battery does die a lot quicker than hers which she is understanding of.\n\nI haven't seen much of Danny since he and Lucy began dating in March last year, not because of Lucy but we've all been busy with college and jobs. We still text all the time and he's the same as always in that regard. So their party was my first look at the \"new\" Danny and I think I obviously didn't cope well with the change since I hadn't been around to see it happen gradually so to me it seemed sudden.\n\nI worried Danny was unhappy because not long ago he would have been miserable and jealous at a party like that and in that kind of relationship. I think throughout the night I convinced myself Lucy was hurting him and wound myself up in self righteousness so by the end of the night when Lucy made her comment I thought she was just trying to antagonize me and I wrongly snapped.\n\nTo cut a long story short. Me and Danny are fine. Danny and Lucy are fine. Me and Lucy are going to hang out to get to know each other better. She does seem really nice and I feel horrible for ending her party on such a bad note.", "created_utc": 1683461286, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13alusf/update_aita_for_telling_my_best_friend_his_gf_is/", "score": 4046, "replies": ["https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1347bo7/aita_for_telling_my_best_friend_his_gf_is/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ioscss&utm_content=2&utm_term=1\n\nOG post", "[removed]", "You did well to meet with them.

It's never a good idea to tell someone your in love with them if they're with someone else.", "Sometimes you\u2019re afraid of change or you\u2019re jealous that other people have relationships when you don\u2019t, or you really like your friends to the point of doing irrational things.\n\nLove is not always romantic. \nAnd sometimes, you should not tell strangers how they are feeling. They can figure it out on their own.", "Did she cut it though?", "I don't think an explanation is necessarily a rationalization.", "Also maybe I missed it but I\u2019m not seeing anywhere that OP actually apologized to the gf. Sounds like she just explained her insecure reasons \u201cwhy\u201d and that was it.", "The I was worried she is saying was her mindset during the party not that she is still worried following their talk", "To play Devil's advocate here, i could see OOP potentially being afraid of losing her friend since he's changed (even if it's changed for the better or just a neutral change) and that could cause the hostile reaction and protectiveness. Doesn't make it right, but sort of gives more insight.", "Yeah, she knows him so well, despite not seeing him for 14 months.", "Yes! Rationalizing is explaining why then summing up with how they weren\u2019t wrong .OP admits they are wrong, and details how she went off the rails. That\u2019s   Taking responsibility for her actions that night. This is great progress.\n\nOp also has room for further growth.\n\nThis isn\u2019t for you as a response but things for OP to mull over\n\nI do think she should reflect on how so many of her perceptions were incorrect. OP disregarded the length of time Danny and Lucy were together, that they were serious enough that they didn\u2019t only move in together, but have a house! She didn\u2019t consider that she didn\u2019t know Lucy very well nor express interest in getting to know her better at this party. She didn\u2019t arrive to mix and mingle, she arrived to shadow Danny and be Batman to his Gotham. Does he truly need a protector? Does she not like how she behaved when things didn\u2019t work out? Is she upset that Danny is attracted to women that have personalities that aren\u2019t like hers? Does she really read his face accurately? She reads upset but what if the face everyone else saw was in love?  \n\nI think it\u2019s good that she realizes how out of the loop she\u2019s become and I\u2019m glad Danny and Lucy are willing to welcome her in after that night", "Oh no. Both the original post and this one still has vibes of I like Danny.", "Even if you aren\u2019t in love with him, you come off as though you feel the need to insert yourself in his personal relationships. \u201cProtecting\u201d someone who didn\u2019t ask to be protected is closer to controlling/possessive than anything else", "\\*Morgan Freeman Voiceover\\* - \"She did not\"", "The idea that trying to understand/explain your actions is the same as justifying them is really pervasive. When I was a little kid I had a teacher who would constantly scold me for \"making excuses\". I was genuinely trying to process why I had such serious difficulty with certain tasks versus others but all she wanted to hear was \"I'm a lazy little shit and I didn't do my homework because I'm morally corrupt\".", "reading comprehension isn't your strongest skill, is it?", "Yep. Maybe we should start a Lucy fan club. She seems feckin awesome tbh.", "I'm sorry. I can't read that. Who is worried?", "Right? It's literally OP's only other post, it wasn't hard to find.", "Sorry, so when op is saying that they were worried Danny was unhappy, I think she meant back during the party not currently. And she was worried based off of her previous experiences with Danny in social situations. But now following the conversation she had with him and Lucy, she realizes she was wrong on that night. So like she's not trying to makes excuses anymore for her behavior but rather trying to explain why she was worried that night\n\nI hope i make more sense now lol", "yea and she barfed it all up because she's obsessed with Danny! I think you have to be pretty oblivious to not notice what is going on with her", "This is a good update, OP took the criticism at heart and made amends.", "Right, I agree. I just don't why she shouldn't be that invested in Danny at any point. As another redditor said, it seemed like she was babysitting him all night, and trying to read his moods and expressions. \n\nIt just seems weird. IDK if she protests waaay too much about her feelings for the guy, and IDC. I just know that most friends will look in on you when you're out, check in with you. But nobody should be taking your temperature the whole time.", "I feel like this has gotta be part of it. Her hanging around people she knows in an environment she wouldn't otherwise be comfortable being in doesn't read as weird or overly clingy to me. And like, I just can't see a negative from this update - mature communication and a resolve to do better in the future.", "> It\u2019s like there\u2019s no redemption without an intense bout of self flagellation.\n\nAnd if they _do_ self flagellate then they're \"whining\", \"still making it all about themselves\" and \"weaponising their guilt to be manipulative\". Absolutely no winning.", "No, but im not going to cheer from the stands while she doubles down on excuses or \"explanations\" and still has very problematic behavior and beliefs that she has not addressed or even mentioned in her \"update\"", "I'm still 100% (okay, more like 80%) a girl, and I was totally guilty of that, I cringe a lot when I think about the old me. Unlearning internalized misogyny is honestly one of the best thing that have happened to me.", "Have you considered OP doesn\u2019t owe you, or me, or anyone else here shit? We\u2019re not her friends or her overlords or her mom, we got our fun and entertainment from our outrage and piling on her in the original post. She could come back in here and flip everyone off if she wanted. I\u2019m happy we got an update, if we never give anyone credit for at least trying why would any of the AH update us ever?", "I mean, you did read the part where she's going to hang out w Lucy and get to know her better, right? If you're hellbent on seeing OP in the worst light you could interpret that poorly, but it really reads to me like \"I fucked up because I was working with out-of-date assumptions, and here's what I'm going to do so I don't fuck up again, and keep my friend in my life.\" \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f It's just hard for me to see a negative to this update.", "Hey, I know you\u2019re getting a lot of flack on here but I wanted to say I\u2019m proud of you for actually listening to the responses in your original post and doing your best", "You did really well! I\u2019m glad things are working out.", "That is great. I am really pleased to read all that.", "y\u2019all in the comments are acting like men and women can\u2019t just be friends and then trying to say she\u2019s the problem. like :/", "Joey and Janice's Day of Fun. Is it bat day at Shea Stadium?", "YTA for not linking the original post \ud83d\ude44", "It's good you were able to see that you were being an asshole, but you still need to address why you're slut shaming other women and have such hangups about sex. You could be asexual, which is totally fine, but shaming others when they show affection or express healthy sexuality is not ok. I really recommend getting therapy for that and working on not slut shaming women. That shit is toxic.\n\nAlso, watch out for being a \"protector.\" You seem to be projecting your own insecurities onto others under the guise of \"protecting\" and are not properly reading other people. Worry about working on yourself and if you think a friend is uncomfortable or upset, ask them how they are feeling, don't tell them what they are feeling. Actually listen to them.", "girlie leave danny alone. he\u2019s never gonna pick you, choose you, love you. go get a man and get over him because it\u2019s clear from how you wrote the previous post you want him. also, you\u2019re trying so hard to excuse your because of \u201cyour feelings\u201d and not actually TAKING accountability that you were being irrational and rude for no reason other than your own insecurities and jealously. i hope Lucy stays away from you because something tells me you\u2019re just going to start more shit. Lucy really is the bigger and better person for even being able to sit down with you, i would\u2019ve ripped your extensions out", "i hope that Danny goes NC with you because you really need to take some time and get yourself some therapy. you cant grow up in five days and need to work on yourself it\u2019s clear", "Look at you growing! Well done! I hope things go back to a nice new normal for you guys, hell maybe they'll help you come out of your shell a bit too!", "You'll keep growing\ud83e\udd1e\ud83c\udffe", "From the original post:\n\n>Lucy ruffled his hair (which he hates)\n\nThe moment where you can tell she\u2019s in love with Danny and jealous of Lucy, the insistence that she knows him better than this other girl *possibly* could. OP was acting like a cat trying to mark her territory.", "on god you can tell that she\u2019s trying to excuse her rudeness instead of actually taking accountability", "Your husband had a friend that made one mistake and apologized? \n\nThat's the information we have here. OP made a mistake one time and apologized. Projecting your situation is not helpful to anyone.", "Yep seen this so many times. Even if she isn\u2019t in love with him, she still wants him to be in love with her.", "Suspiciously well \ud83e\udd14", "How has this been downvoted, it\u2019s my favourite and should be top \ud83d\udd1d", "OP can\u2019t accept that her friend isn\u2019t a quiet nerd in a group of quiet nerds anymore. Whether or not she\u2019s in love with him, she has certainly shown distaste for this change.", "You clearly don't realize it, but you definitely do come off as the Julia Roberts character in My Best Friend's Wedding.", "\"I emphatically apologized to Lucy and then to Danny.\"\n\nYou missed it", "That\u2019s a whole lot of projection for something as simple as they don\u2019t know to, or you can just click on their profile. Wth lmao", "I hear that. I have a lifelong friend that got married while I was, and it was hard for her to navigate at first. But we all figured it out without her lashing out at me. \n\nBut again, OP is 22yo, so IDK.", "I have friends I haven\u2019t seen in person in 5 years. We still talk At least twice a week and text all the time. One does not need to see friends to remain close with them.", "I think people really want to take reasons as excuses and I'm not sure why. Maybe, I'm not sure, people just want to vilify someone to justify their initial judgment of the situation?\n\nI think OP's explanation is perfectly reasonable. She genuinely thought she was trying to help her friend who she has seen hurt in the past. That was the thought process. Not only was she wrong, she handled it badly. Saying, \"this is what I was thinking when I did that stupid thing\" is fine if what comes before it and after it is \"I wish I hadn't done that stupid then and I was wrong.\" \n\nIf my friend did something like this to me and my partner I'd like to know why. Intentions do matter to me.", "Apparently. I agree with you and was adding on\u2026 or at least attempting to. So my bad if I\u2019m completely misunderstanding something.\n\nEdit:  Good lord. No. Reading comprehension is not my friend today. I\u2019m just having a dumb day because I also was confused by your comment. I\u2019m going to go caffeinate.", "We've been obsessing so thoroughly! as evidenced by you calling her a him haha.", "Glad you took the advice to heart. Thanks for the update.", "Well, I'm glad you owned up to your screw-up and apologized and talked it out.\n\nFrom your original post, Danny seemed very happy with Lucy, and Lucy seemed understanding of his limits, so even though you couldn't see it then, I'm happy that you see it now and that you value your friendship enough to put aside your feelings because your friend is in a happy and healthy relationship.", "So glad to see an update like this. It isn't always easy to apologize but you really stepped up when it was needed. I'm glad you were able to mend things and will hopefully be able to become friends with Lucy", "Bottom line here is that we all make bad decisions, and you made a really bad one. What matters more than anything is picking yourself up and trying to make things right. Seems like you're accepting the responsibility for your actions, and trying to make amends. I respect that.\n\nJust remember, how they take it is totally up to them. Im happy for you that they're open to rebuilding bridges, but if they decide its not working, be ready to accept their decision.", "You did the bare minimum, so now continue to do better.", "all of this ^^^", "\"She touched his hair.\" \n\"She's dressed to get attention.\"\n\"I can't stand hearing any implication that they have a sexual relationship.\"\n\nYep. That's what platonic friends say.", "Agreed.", "Exactly. When I make a bad mistake, I try to remember why I thought it was a good idea at the time and then try to find where I went wrong in justifying it at the time so I don\u2019t make the same justification in the future for something else.", "because so many irrational people out there, for some odd reason, believe that trying to explain yourself means you're just trying to excuse yourself; immediately they're always like \"I don't want to hear excuses!\" makes me so angry. Someone trying to explain what happened and why it happened and why they did what they did is not them trying to excuse themselves.\n\nPeople often don't realize that's not simply a matter of someone saying \"sorry, I was wrong.\" and conversation over. You need context. But I think people, especially those in authority, are always too obsessed with being right, and fear that hearing explanations will point a finger back at them being irrational or wrong for being angry.", "Yeah, but you probably don't act like you know them best and treat their partners like crap either, then use the whole \"he changed over 14 months and I didn't know\" defense.", "Yeah...there's a massive difference between \"I wasn't in the wrong because....\" and \"I behaved badly because....and I shouldn't have.\" \n\nIf someone was shitty to me, I'd like to know *why* they thought what they did was okay at the time. \n\nAnd OP framed it the right way - \"*I'm* super protective and crossed a line...*I* was operating off old information...\"  [paraphrasing here]. OP didn't say \"well, you should have told me about the change!\" She took ownership. It came from a well-intended place, but was the wrong thing to do.", "I 100% agree. I do not understand why she is still being attacked. She is not trying to justify anything, she is merely explaining her rationale but recognizing that it was obviously wrong.", "They were replying to the main point that your comment seemed to be making: \u201cugh she\u2019s STILL doing it\u201d. They\u2019re saying she\u2019s *not* still doing it- she is sharing her introspection onto her past actions. We all agree her behavior at the party was wrong. So does OP. She learned a lesson and grew as a person. We should be commending her, not continuing to bash her for her mistake that she has now fully admitted was a mistake.", "I can't even with your timeline, but have a good day!", "Yes it was an incredibly complex 5 sentences. Have a good life."]}
