I don't know if anyone wants an update since I seem to be Reddit's villain of the week...\n\nBefore I continue with the update I'd just like to clarify, someone DMed me saying Danny posted an update that Lucy cheated on him. I don't know if Danny even has a Reddit, and while I haven't been able to find the post myself, I can confirm that's not true, someone is lying to cause further issues...\n\nAnyway I texted Danny and asked if I could sit down with him and Lucy to talk, they agreed and we met for coffee. I emphatically apologized to Lucy and then to Danny.\n\nWe spoke in detail about how in the past Danny has been similar to me in his attitude towards sex/PDA etc (not just our awkward high school fling, but every relationship he's had since) and how he used to be insecure when his ex girlfriends did anything that made him jealous. Over the years I've become really protective of him because he got hurt a lot.\n\nDanny explained that Lucy has brought him out of his shell and he's much more outgoing now (the opposite of how our friend group has just kind of always been) but his social battery does die a lot quicker than hers which she is understanding of.\n\nI haven't seen much of Danny since he and Lucy began dating in March last year, not because of Lucy but we've all been busy with college and jobs. We still text all the time and he's the same as always in that regard. So their party was my first look at the \"new\" Danny and I think I obviously didn't cope well with the change since I hadn't been around to see it happen gradually so to me it seemed sudden.\n\nI worried Danny was unhappy because not long ago he would have been miserable and jealous at a party like that and in that kind of relationship. I think throughout the night I convinced myself Lucy was hurting him and wound myself up in self righteousness so by the end of the night when Lucy made her comment I thought she was just trying to antagonize me and I wrongly snapped.\n\nTo cut a long story short. Me and Danny are fine. Danny and Lucy are fine. Me and Lucy are going to hang out to get to know each other better. She does seem really nice and I feel horrible for ending her party on such a bad note.", "created_utc": 1683461286, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13alusf/update_aita_for_telling_my_best_friend_his_gf_is/", "score": 1315, "replies": ["https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1347bo7/aita_for_telling_my_best_friend_his_gf_is/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ioscss&utm_content=2&utm_term=1\n\nOG post", "[removed]", "You did well to meet with them.

But she wants him to want her.", "Or they assume you'll just click on their profile/post history if you don't remember or didn't see their original post?", "I got that impression from OP's \"I seem to be Reddit's villain of the week\", as though we're all just stewing in rage by our computers, waiting for him to post an update. Bro, I've never spared a single thought for you.", ">It sounds like everybody won here, why try to make it negative?\n\nReddit demands a loser, and loves punishing women in general.", "> No, she is trying to excuse her behaviour in a way that makes her come out on top. I won't even touch the slutshaming here.\n\nShe has accepted she was wrong and owned up to her mistakes. She\u2019s not trying to excuse her behavior, she is simply trying to explain it.", "I disagree - \"I cannot explain my bad behavior\" is just a lie if you have reflected on your behavior properly and know why you acted a certain way. \n\nThe former format \"I was rude because I thought...\" explanation comes from realizing the exact part of her previous thinking that was wrong and being honest about it.   And hopefully it means she can take steps to prevent doing it int he future.", "i was so not like other girls i transitioned. it\u2019s a dangerous game", "Idk I feel weird about that. I grew up in a very conservative place, that sort not like that other girls attitude is often a result of that forced idea of femininity get shoved down ppls throat.", "My husband had such a friend.", "She's long gone and I'm here to stay.", "It's funny to watch them del the post.

Inline with 2xcromosomes and relationshipadvice", "Absolutely. A few things are better, but:\n\nI obviously didn't cope well with the change since I hadn't been around to see it happen gradually so to me it seemed sudden.", ">P.s. she didn't learn anything.\n\nI'm really curious how you can make this assessment, given that it runs contrary to the actions she tells us she's taking post-judgement.\n\nSo either you don't believe *anything* she says, in which case why are you even here, or you're psychic, in which case I imagine you have better uses to put your powers to than reddit.\n\nThe fact that you can't seem to fathom friends *forgiving* people and improving their relationships when someone makes a mistake says way more about you than it does about OP.", "That is how adult relationships work sometimes fwiw, given she is on the young side for that to be a lived reality it\u2019s totally within reason to happen.", "OP says they haven\u2019t seen each other much since March of *last year* \u2026 there\u2019s probably a good reason for that.

It\u2019s like there\u2019s no redemption without an intense bout of self flagellation.\n\nWhat I find ironic is that this is the same place where I find posts by people who have been made to feel so small and unworthy and like they need to grovel and self flagellate in their home or work lives, where this community tells them anyone who would make them feel that way is an asshole, no matter the circumstances.\n\nIt\u2019s not every thread, but damn it\u2019s a lot.", "The way you handled this whole situation was extremely weird and indicative of some deep personal insecurities that you should probably stop inflicting on the people around you.", "You see her own shit in the penultimate paragraph. The discussion with them is her maintaining that had Danny been the \"old\" Danny, she'd have behaved exactly right. That's a yuck from me.", "What you're describing is rationalization. It's \"I can explain my behaviour in ways that make sense to me\" - a far cry from an explanation that would make sense to anyone else. \nIf you want to see her *truly* explain her bad behaviour, it's that second-to-last paragraph.\n\nWe are well programed/taught to understand rationalizatuon as explanation so it can be tricky to tell them apart. Rationalizing is \"in my head, my behaviour made sense\". Explaining is \"if I were teaching a child (or someone unfamiliar with the nuts and bolts of bad behaviour) what I did wrong/where I went wrong, there never is a good explanation for bad behaviour except 'I made a bad decision'.\"", "You missed off the even more salient point that all of this scandalous dancing occurred *in Lucy's own home* among her friends. \n\nIt's worse than Watergate.", "Right? for some of us it's the only way we have to talk about dysphoria.

Bot, or copycat?", "I keep seeing people claiming twoxchromosomes is toxic but anytime I've seen that sub it's just women talking about their experiences as women. How is that toxic?", "These types of attitudes are internalized misogyny, mine was from my mother and how she raised me to hate women,", "I mean, due to health issues/scheduling/life getting in the way, I haven't seen one of my best friends in person since before Covid. We still love and care about each other, and keep each other updated on big life stuff and funny memes.", "No.  \"I made a bad decision\" doesn't help you avoid it in the future or help you teach a child.  \"I made a bad decision because ... \"  means you can identify the pattern/reason/feelings in the future, reassess before you act, and act differently than you would have before.\n\nBad decisions are rarely considered as bad decisions when they're made.  So you can't learn if your aim is to \"avoid bad decisions\".  Bad decisions are misinformed decisions or decisions based on your life experiences that shouldn't be carried over to this situation.  So you learn by identifying when you may be misinformed or when you're applying thinking that might be wrong.\n\nOP has learnt not to act immediately when missing information (I.e. They'd not seen friend in a while and assumed they were the same. But they weren't.)   I do think OP also needs to learn that they acted over the top even if they were concerned for their friend. A conversation later saying \"Hey.  I'm not sure this new gf of yours is right for you.\" would be more acceptable.", "\ud83e\udd23", " You did well to meet with them.

When I first discovered this sub, I mostly just read the stories, and a couple comments. Now I look at a lot more of the comments, and people here are very often batshit insane. But it isn't something I noticed right away.", "Its like watching joey swoll videos, but without joey swoll calling women out for crushing guys behaviors that are perceived by women as offensive when they may not be, or just taken in the wrong context. Instead comments seem escalate into tangents and unrelated experiences shitting on guys.\n\nIt kind of reminds me of when a friend(girl) was complaining about her boyfriend and explaining all of these thing that were happening from her perspective which all sounded horrible and i advised her to think hard about leaving him. Eventually she admitted she jumped to conclusions and was way off base on what actually happened in a lot of scenarios. They ended up getting married. That was an awkward conversation i had with her now husband apologizing for my advice since i only had to go with what she had told me.\n\nIts was not every post that showed up on my feed, since there are some crappy things that happen to women and are valid concerns..  But it was enough where its one of the few subreddits i blocked because I have no business posting there and what i read was frustrating.", "Danny and Lucy go out partying; I highly doubt Covid concerns are a part of the thought process for them", "I feel like there can be a reason you do something and still know it's wrong.

It won't happen again.\"\n\nAn \"I'm sorry, but...\" would look a lot more \"I was actually in the right and justified about what I did\" and a lot less \"I messed up, and this is why.\n\nYou sound like someone who'd look for reasons while shutting down every single one as an excuse. OP is a flawed person, and even this update doesn't fix all of that, BUT it is an opportunity for growth.
