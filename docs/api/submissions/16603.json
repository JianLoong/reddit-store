{"id": 16603, "submission_id": "13alusf", "title": "UPDATE - AITA for telling my best friend his gf is disgusting?", "selftext": "Okay I completely accept I was an asshole. I don't know if anyone wants an update since I seem to be Reddit's villain of the week...\n\nBefore I continue with the update I'd just like to clarify, someone DMed me saying Danny posted an update that Lucy cheated on him. I don't know if Danny even has a Reddit, and while I haven't been able to find the post myself, I can confirm that's not true, someone is lying to cause further issues...\n\nAnyway I texted Danny and asked if I could sit down with him and Lucy to talk, they agreed and we met for coffee. I emphatically apologized to Lucy and then to Danny.\n\nWe spoke in detail about how in the past Danny has been similar to me in his attitude towards sex/PDA etc (not just our awkward high school fling, but every relationship he's had since) and how he used to be insecure when his ex girlfriends did anything that made him jealous. Over the years I've become really protective of him because he got hurt a lot.\n\nDanny explained that Lucy has brought him out of his shell and he's much more outgoing now (the opposite of how our friend group has just kind of always been) but his social battery does die a lot quicker than hers which she is understanding of.\n\nI haven't seen much of Danny since he and Lucy began dating in March last year, not because of Lucy but we've all been busy with college and jobs. We still text all the time and he's the same as always in that regard. So their party was my first look at the \"new\" Danny and I think I obviously didn't cope well with the change since I hadn't been around to see it happen gradually so to me it seemed sudden.\n\nI worried Danny was unhappy because not long ago he would have been miserable and jealous at a party like that and in that kind of relationship. I think throughout the night I convinced myself Lucy was hurting him and wound myself up in self righteousness so by the end of the night when Lucy made her comment I thought she was just trying to antagonize me and I wrongly snapped.\n\nTo cut a long story short. Me and Danny are fine. Danny and Lucy are fine. Me and Lucy are going to hang out to get to know each other better. She does seem really nice and I feel horrible for ending her party on such a bad note.", "created_utc": 1683461286, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13alusf/update_aita_for_telling_my_best_friend_his_gf_is/", "score": 70, "replies": ["https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1347bo7/aita_for_telling_my_best_friend_his_gf_is/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ioscss&utm_content=2&utm_term=1\n\nOG post", "I remember that post. I seriously thought you were so creepy. Mostly for slut shaming Lucy for wearing \"revealing clothes\" and attention seeking dancing (i don't even know what that means). Yikes. How do you have friends is beyond me..  i'd run like hell if i were them.", "You did well to meet with them. By your description of the conversation, you still came off as trying to rationalize your rudeness, but most of us do that, I suppose.\n\nYou're young yet. And you're in love with Danny. Things will be strained until you can see that. Then they'll be painful.", "I hope you learn to love yourself and be less judgemental going forward.", "Thanks for the update. It\u2019s nice to see someone on Reddit accept when they are wrong instead of doubling-down or just deleting the post altogether. Good for you OP, and I hope things work out with all of you.", "You were wicked creepy I\u2019m glad you cut the shit", "good you took accountability", "I\u2019m glad you straightened out. You were really giving off \u201cI\u2019m not like other girls\u201d vibes.", "Well at least you have worked to make amends - even if you were villain of the week.\n\nThat says enough about your character.", "Your 4th paragraph sounds like you\u2019re still not really getting it. You\u2019re making rationalizations for why you acted a certain way instead of fully taking accountability for your actions.\n\nThis feels a lot like an \u201cI\u2019m sorry BUT\u201d apology, where you\u2019ve tried to spin things around so your actions make you now look like a good guy. You\u2019re making excuses for your behavior and hiding behind the guise of concern. \n\nI don\u2019t know if you realize this, but you can still be protective of your friends without full on insulting their partner. You still have a long way to go in this whole thing.", "I don't get why people are so rude to you in the comments, you made a mistake but what's important is that you apologised and realised you were wrong. I'm glad you'll get to know lucy better", "I think you have a long way to go in your thinking. Realizing that these friendships aren't sustainable is key.", "I'm amazed this ended so well.", "It was good you talked to them. However, you still seem to be coming off as a bit rude. I mean villain of the week\u2026 yikes. Plus that last post I got weird vibes from you. Idk you should have been happy that your friend is coming out of his shell. I hope you learned your lesson bc even after reading this post it\u2019s still sounds like there is something off.", "She definitely needs to watch how much she projects onto other gals. Sounds like she has some of that high school \"other girls\" baggage", ">for slut shaming Lucy for wearing \"revealing clothes\" and attention seeking dancing (i don't even know what that means). Yikes. How do you have friends is beyond me..  i'd run like hell if i were them.\n\nwoahhh harsh", "Absolutely. A few things are better, but: \n\n>I obviously didn't cope well with the change since I hadn't been around to see it happen gradually so to me it seemed sudden.\n\nUnless the New Danny is suddenly spouting off racist shit or mainlining heroin, can you imagine being so offended/protective of a \"friend\" changing? \n\n>I worried Danny was unhappy because not long ago he would have been miserable and jealous at a party like that and in that kind of relationship. \n\nUgggggh. She is STILL doing the whole, 'I know Danny better than anyone else,' bullshit. \n\nBut how much can you grow up in 5 days, so \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", ">you still came off as trying to rationalize your rudeness\n\nSounds to me like she was just trying to explain herself, not \"rationalize\". OP accepts that she was wrong, no rationalization required.", "I know a lot of you came up with your own narrative that I'm secretly in love with Danny, but I'm really not, Ive never been in love with him. People can be protective of their friends and love someone platonically", "You mean the \"i'm not like other girls\" type? Those are the worse kind of girls.", "Did you read the post?? She literally went to fully attack lucy just for dancing, in her own home, with her friends.", "\ud83c\udfaf", "This drives me nuts in general, not just this specific situation. Based on this update, they talked the whole thing through. There can be conversation about WHY the thing happened. It sounds like everybody won here, why try to make it negative?", "Rationalizations often sound like people explaining themselves. But here's the difference. Rationalization attempts to justify the behaviour. \n\n\"I was rude because I thought that  knowing him in my context meant I had the right to judge your relationship in your context.\" - this is an explanation \n\n\"I cannot explain my bad behaviour - I spoke out of turn. In no way was criticizing your clothes, dancing, or interactions with Danny appropriate.\" - this is ownership \n\nShe's rationalizing - she's trying to find a way to make her behaviour make sense in a way that would excuse it. I don't care if you share a brain with my partner. *Nothing* gives you the right to to sit in judgment of me and speak on his behalf.", "I haven't read your original post yet, but the vibe coming off *this* one is definitely that you ~~secretly~~ wish you were with this dude, but really are trying to be chill with *not* being with him.", "I don't think it's all that secret. But... \n\nOk, I will take you at face value. If you don't have feelings for him, you have a strange sense of boundaries and what is \"yours\" and what is \"theirs.\" Your entire focus at the party was Danny. Sounds like you babysat him. Why? Anyway. You're sorting this all out. But, stay in your lane. Highschool is over and friends are companions not care-takers.", "its one thing to be protective but its quite another to slut shame and judge them in their own home.  you didnt even want to give her the benefit of the doubt and get to know her first u just went at her full steam.  but i give u props for at least having some class enough to apologize and meant it.", "Yes. And they don't slut shame their friends' partners or call them disgusting or try to build up imaginary scenarios of how said partners are hurting their friends. But you do you. \nPeople are protective of their friends, they don't actively try to sabotage said friend's relationship. You really need to give them both some space and get in touch with reality", "I read the post, but if we constantly make people feel bad for past mistakes that they are learning and growing from, it defeats the purpose of them learning from it.", "Possessiveness!  Not a healthy friendship.", "I mean, that happened last week. And in this post op just makes one excuse after another", "It doesn't sound like she learned anything or is growing at all. This post is just one excuse after another."]}
