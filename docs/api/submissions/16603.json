I don't know if anyone wants an update since I seem to be Reddit's villain of the week...\n\nBefore I continue with the update I'd just like to clarify, someone DMed me saying Danny posted an update that Lucy cheated on him. I don't know if Danny even has a Reddit, and while I haven't been able to find the post myself, I can confirm that's not true, someone is lying to cause further issues...\n\nAnyway I texted Danny and asked if I could sit down with him and Lucy to talk, they agreed and we met for coffee. I emphatically apologized to Lucy and then to Danny.\n\nWe spoke in detail about how in the past Danny has been similar to me in his attitude towards sex/PDA etc (not just our awkward high school fling, but every relationship he's had since) and how he used to be insecure when his ex girlfriends did anything that made him jealous. Over the years I've become really protective of him because he got hurt a lot.\n\nDanny explained that Lucy has brought him out of his shell and he's much more outgoing now (the opposite of how our friend group has just kind of always been) but his social battery does die a lot quicker than hers which she is understanding of.\n\nI haven't seen much of Danny since he and Lucy began dating in March last year, not because of Lucy but we've all been busy with college and jobs. We still text all the time and he's the same as always in that regard. So their party was my first look at the \"new\" Danny and I think I obviously didn't cope well with the change since I hadn't been around to see it happen gradually so to me it seemed sudden.\n\nI worried Danny was unhappy because not long ago he would have been miserable and jealous at a party like that and in that kind of relationship. I think throughout the night I convinced myself Lucy was hurting him and wound myself up in self righteousness so by the end of the night when Lucy made her comment I thought she was just trying to antagonize me and I wrongly snapped.\n\nTo cut a long story short. Me and Danny are fine. Danny and Lucy are fine. Me and Lucy are going to hang out to get to know each other better. She does seem really nice and I feel horrible for ending her party on such a bad note.", "created_utc": 1683461286, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13alusf/update_aita_for_telling_my_best_friend_his_gf_is/", "score": 443, "replies": ["https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1347bo7/aita_for_telling_my_best_friend_his_gf_is/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ioscss&utm_content=2&utm_term=1\n\nOG post", "I remember that post.

By your description of the conversation, you still came off as trying to rationalize your rudeness, but most of us do that, I suppose.\n\nYou're young yet. And you're in love with Danny.

It\u2019s nice to see someone on Reddit accept when they are wrong instead of doubling-down or just deleting the post altogether. Good for you OP, and I hope things work out with all of you.", "You were wicked creepy I\u2019m glad you cut the shit", "good you took accountability", "I\u2019m glad you straightened out.

You\u2019re making rationalizations for why you acted a certain way instead of fully taking accountability for your actions.\n\nThis feels a lot like an \u201cI\u2019m sorry BUT\u201d apology, where you\u2019ve tried to spin things around so your actions make you now look like a good guy. You\u2019re making excuses for your behavior and hiding behind the guise of concern. \n\nI don\u2019t know if you realize this, but you can still be protective of your friends without full on insulting their partner.

Based on this update, they talked the whole thing through. There can be conversation about WHY the thing happened. It sounds like everybody won here, why try to make it negative?", "Rationalizations often sound like people explaining themselves. But here's the difference. Rationalization attempts to justify the behaviour. \n\n\"I was rude because I thought that  knowing him in my context meant I had the right to judge your relationship in your context.\" - this is an explanation \n\n\"I cannot explain my bad behaviour - I spoke out of turn. In no way was criticizing your clothes, dancing, or interactions with Danny appropriate.\" - this is ownership \n\nShe's rationalizing - she's trying to find a way to make her behaviour make sense in a way that would excuse it. I don't care if you share a brain with my partner. *Nothing* gives you the right to to sit in judgment of me and speak on his behalf.", "I haven't read your original post yet, but the vibe coming off *this* one is definitely that you ~~secretly~~ wish you were with this dude, but really are trying to be chill with *not* being with him.", "I don't think it's all that secret. But... \n\nOk, I will take you at face value. If you don't have feelings for him, you have a strange sense of boundaries and what is \"yours\" and what is \"theirs.\" Your entire focus at the party was Danny. Sounds like you babysat him. Why? Anyway. You're sorting this all out. But, stay in your lane. Highschool is over and friends are companions not care-takers.", "its one thing to be protective but its quite another to slut shame and judge them in their own home.  you didnt even want to give her the benefit of the doubt and get to know her first u just went at her full steam.  but i give u props for at least having some class enough to apologize and meant it.", "Yes. And they don't slut shame their friends' partners or call them disgusting or try to build up imaginary scenarios of how said partners are hurting their friends. But you do you. \nPeople are protective of their friends, they don't actively try to sabotage said friend's relationship.

This post is just one excuse after another.", "Girl, Are you familiar with the term \u201cinternalized misogyny\u201d?\nYou're not the villain, but it's obvious that you expect other women not to have fun, to be sexual beings and on top of that you think you're superior because of it. \nI'm glad Danny broke away from his group of friends who seem to be quite critical of other people, without taking responsibility and recognizing that the world doesn't have to play by the your rules.", "Yea.....Danny would be smart to leave you behind NGL you seem toxic AF", "This is great. Glad you took some steps to repair the situation.", "It's good the three of you are working things out; still, you have a long way to go. Two areas you need to work on, in particular, are trust and respect for your friends. Danny said he was fine and everything was okay, but that wasn't good enough for you at the time, and one would think their best friend has more trust in and respect for their friend than to disregard their feelings and what they say. \r  \n\r  \nBeing protective is one thing; I happen to be the protective friend in my group as well, and I've had my best friend change without me, and I struggled to play catch up on her life, but being obstinate is another.

I'd imagine Danny is gonna be having a lot less to do with you going forward.", "You need to go to therapy. The way you handled this whole situation was extremely weird and indicative of some deep personal insecurities that you should probably stop inflicting on the people around you.", "I'm glad that things are going to be worked out. Sometimes later when you go back and apologize things can be cool. I saw you take accountability and that means you're trying to improve and not be a TA.", "Idk I would really like you to take responsibility for the amount of slut shaming on that post lol. I think the slut shaming is what most people were upset about.", "She explains herself, she says why she acted the way she did and the external and internal factors which led to this. Not once does she justify, which would be explaining why it had to happen. \n\nPeople often confuse the two, as explanation can often come off as justification. Yes explanation is I guess a justification of your own internal logic, but this doesn't translate to a justification of external action, especially when they have apologized for their abhorrent behavior and accepted the explanation of their friends situation. \n\nStop thought policing people and learn to have a self-critical conversation.", "In the original post \"feeling uncomfortable\" was written so often that it really made me feel uncomfortable.\n\nLet people be who they a they are without trying to shame them for it. When two adults are together it is not for you to but in, how someone dances or dresses is not for you to judge - or you can judge them as much as you want, as long as you keep it for yourself. Maybe you will find out that Lucy and you won't become friends - pretty likely actually - refrain from making it an issue, or you will loose your friendship with Danny.", "I'm still not loving OP here.

She accepted the verdict that she\u2019s the AH and then set out to fix her huge AH mistake. I\u2019ve seen sooo many people just double down and this one DID NOT DO THAT. OP don\u2019t listen to these people still wanting you to be the villain. I agree with the theory you have a thing for this guy and you need to face that and move on but you did exactly the right thing in trying to make ammends. Maybe you should just stay away from Danny for a while. but good for you for apologizing and reaching out to his girlfriend.", "Thank you for doing the lord\u2019s work.", "Luckily they allow room for their friends to learn from their mistakes, apologize, and move forward.

She's seriously trying to say that she was concerned for her friend and got carried away in her self-righteousness? Most people who get concerned for their friend know better than to slut-shame their partner. That behavior speaks to much bigger underlying issues and insecurities, and more often than not points to jealousy, especially if it involves an ex-girlfriend denigrating the current girlfriend.\n\nI don't buy this for a second.

I this she accepts that her reaction was wrong and sought out how to rectify it, but identifying why we do these sorts of things (such as her saying she thinks she did it because she was overprotective of him from past experiences but that she hadn't seen him act like this ever before). We can't learn from our mistakes if we don't acknowledge where the mistake came from, and people having a go at her for it won't make anything better.\n\nAlso, it really depends on the friend and the partner in regards to how you protect them, if this has been how she has had to look out for him in the past, it's reasonable to assume to do the same thing again. Sure, maybe she had more of a pre-disposition to do it than seems rational, but feelings (even in regards to friendships - which she claims this to be) are irrational.", ">I'm glad you'll get to know lucy better\n\nI'm not.
