He is for trying to take advantage of your generosity, as is his mom.", "NTA but....\n\nHaving heard this side of the story, I do wonder whether there is another. You take him to a cheap pasta place and then get annoyed that he doesn't order the cheapest thing that he normally does. \n\nThen you arrange for him to get a free complimentary desert so that you don't have to pay him. \n\nThis does rather sound like a generous offer that isn't intended to be as generous as it sounds. \n\nIf you were to speculate then I would guess that you are rather mindful of your money compared to the generosity of your friends and this was a bit of pay back. \n\nA friend of mind when I was younger would forever avoid buying a round of drinks and always \"forgot his wallet\".

That's unbelievable", "Yeah why have the waitress bring out the extra desserts just to send them back? Most people would have either said no before the waitress put the order in or told her to put them on a separate check.", "Exactly, it was gradually getting worse and worse and the mother call was just like, what is even happening?", "This guy basically confused getting taken out for a birthday treat by a friend with getting a coupon for a free meal and trying to exploit loopholes to get as much free shit as possible. Very weird thing to do, assuming this story is real."]}
