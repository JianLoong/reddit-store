I am also expecting to adopt another kitten Claude, I'll be able to adopt him soon. I've had the three eldest cats since before my wife and I started dating, I provide all the care for the cats, clean their litter boxes, feed them, change their water, and play with them. They are like my babies and I love them. \n\nMy wife doesn't really like pets, she's gentle with the cats but she does nothing for them and quite honestly Leo and Catharina dislike her a lot, they were never able to get fully used to her. \n\nWell, the issue we had is that yesterday a very good friend of mine came to visit and have dinner with us. After dinner, we were hanging out in the lounge room. I was telling him about the new kitten I am gonna adopt. Then my wife said \"We're very excited, he's so cute, let's hope this one likes me since neither of *our* other cats like me\". At that, I responded with \"They're not \"our\" cats, they're mine and they don't like you because you don't make any effort with them\". She then started arguing about how shitty it was to tell her that and that she cares for the cats too, she was nearly screaming at this point so I told her to lower her voice because it was embarrassing to do this when we had guests. That only made things worse and she called me controlling and mean, she said that I won't give her kids and I won't even let her own the cats too. \n\nI was so embarrassed, I asked my friend to please forgive her behavior and that maybe it would be best if he would leave and we'll see each other some other time. I was truly embarrassed, this friend is someone who I appreciate a lot and she knows that, she purposely embarrassed me because she felt like it. \n\nAfter he left she kept arguing, she told me she doesn't see a future with our marriage if I will always leave her behind everything. I told her she was exaggerating, the cats are mine because I am the one taking care of them full-time, and they choose to like me and not her for a reason. I told her I was very embarrassed by her behavior, and at that point, she just shut her mouth and now she won't speak to me at all. I've tried talking to her and she would just ignore me.

The \"she said I won't give her kids\" line stuck with me because it sounds like there is a lot of resentment here with her wanting more than just cats.", "YTA- you say she embarrassed you, but you embarrassed her first. Along with she wants kids and you don't. Telling her she's over reacting to never being a parent is cruel, you don't have to want kids but she's allowed to be upset that you don't want kids OR to share ownership of pets. Have you spoken about maybe her getting a dog or something?

Why can he only be yours?", "Wow I never thought you would make a post about me", "YTA \n\nThat did sound kind of controlling to correct her like that in front of guests. You say she embarrassed you by being mad about it in front of friends, but you embarrassed her first. Being pedantic like that probably affects other parts of your marriage, for instance, that comment about not giving her kids you just happened to throw in there. That could probably be a completely separate post.", "YTA. Was going with E S H since she started the screaming match but by the time I got to the bottom of your letter I'd have been screaming at you too. Connecting these dots for you is going to take a therapist  - get one before you end up divorced.", "YTA and your friend now know you are extremely petty towards your wife.", "This is not about the cats.  It seems that your wife wants a baby and you don\u2019t?  Telling her the cats aren\u2019t hers is rubbing salt in that wound. \n\nYTA for not listening to your wife\u2019s needs.  It does sound like your marriage is in real jeopardy.", "YTA. \n\nI have two cats that I've had since before my current relationship. He does nothing with them and I provide all the care, but since we are together they are OUR cats.\n\nNow if you two break up, then the cats are yours in the eyes of the law because pets are considered property, so whoever brought them into a relationship/pays the most care gets to claim ownership in a split.\n\nIf you are not intending to leave her (and if she doesn't leave you by the sound of this post):\n\nYou embarrassed her by needlessly correcting her in front of your friend. You could have waited until your friend left to bring it up. By bringing it up right then in front of company you actually sound a bit spiteful of the fact that she doesn't contribute to their care.\n\nDo you resent her for not taking care of them? If so you need to speak to her about it rather than passive aggressively stating the cats are yours alone in front of company.", "YTA and I agree with your wife, I don't see a future for this marriage either.", "YTA and I think you're projecting. You deliberately called her out/shamed her in front of your friend then blamed her for embarrassing you?\n\nShe also tried to tell you why it was so upsetting and you disregarded that because the semantics of the who the cats belong to were more important.\n\nAlso the way you wrote about her here, I'm wondering if you even like or respect your wife at all. \n\nAnd yes the cats are your fur babies, but... why are you so incredibly possessive of them you'd hurt your wife's feelings over semantics?", "\"she told me she doesn't see a future with our marriage\" - me neither\n\nYTA- why did you say that in front of your guests?\n\nshe lives with you and your cats dispite you having all the work. \n\nso when women take care of the children and not the men therefore the children don't have a father? \n\nwhen women take care of the clothing.... that means all the clothings belong to them?", "YTA. None of that had to be said in front of someone. That\u2019s your personal business it should of stayed that way.", "YTA - cats are whimsical assholes and their affections are completely random.", "YTA - Who cares whose cats they are, technically? She's your wife. Don't you care about her feelings? Throw her a bone.", "I'm leaning towards YTA. There wasn't any good reason for your behaviour.", "YTA\n\nWhy did you marry someone you do not even like.", "YTA. You insulted your wife in front of a friend, and told her to quiet down when she tried to defend herself. You then told her you were embarrassed by her. Do you even like your wife?", "YTA- it was completely unnecessary for you to correct her in front of your friend, you guys are married. It\u2019s normal for married couples to present a united front in front of other people, one might even say the cats might technically legally be both of yours since you guys are married. This was an incredibly stupid thing for you to have started an argument over", "YTA - Your reaction makes no sense whatsoever. Of all the hills to die on, this one is pretty wild.\n\nYou were the one who decided to start an argument over semantics in front of guests, and then, when she was understandably taken aback by your reaction, you made it worse by asking your friend to \"forgive\" her behaviour?\n\nYou were the embarrassing one here. You are attaching the worst possible motivation to her reaction while excusing her own. If this is how you react to semantics over your cats, I can understand her thinking the future of your marriage is bleak. I hope she is able to find peace and a partner who will actively try to involve her with family pets or at the very least not patronize her in front of guests.", "You really firmly believe that the way you acted doesn't make you an asshole? Why is it so hard to call them our cat instead of solely yours.\n\nIf you were to go your separate ways it would be normal to say it's your cats and that you would keep all of them but saying it like that in a context where you're just all leaving together is a big YTA move.\n\nHow is she supposed to feel like you are one if you are possessive like that over trivial matters? You really need to re-evaluate yourself. The fact that you are also more concerned about being embarrassed in front of your friends rather than making her mad and hurting her is also a big flag.\n\nSo you not only were the asshole but you definitely sound like you are one all the time, especially since you seem to think that it's a normal way of thinking.", "YTA for calling out your wife over pet care at a dinner party that you're supposed to be hosting.  Way to make your guests feel awkward.  I can't believe you took it even further by doubling down and pinning the awkwardness that you instigated to begin with entirely on your wife. Your ego must be awfullly fragile if you're willing to tank your marriage over a couple of cats. Let's be clear: your wife didn't embarrass anyone.  *You* embarrassed everyone.", "YTA. What a petty thing to get mad about, let alone argue about in front of company. You are married! Living in the same house! Making decisions about adopting future pets together! (and if that decision isn't being made together, double yta)\n\nBy all means, establish the cats as your sole property in case of impending divorce. But know that flexing your ownership to the point of policing her language like this IS controlling and mean, and showing your wife that you don't respect her as a part of your family.", "Yta\n\nWow regardless of things.  This isnt the first post we had of someone calling out their SO infront of others about something that can be kept private\n\nAnd being possessive about pets in your home? That she cant even talk about them.  Thats major", "YTA\n\nRead your post and see who started the purposeful embarrassment in front of the guest here.", "YTA- First of all - the cats decide who they belong to and that is reevaluated at least once a day. Secondly, you\u2019re married- you share all things now. And yes, somethings will be more yours than hers, but if she says you share the pets, then you share the pets. Apologize and move on.", "YTA- but she should\u2019ve been more assertive with her life decisions if she wanted kids and you didn\u2019t.  For helping convince her to give up her dream of having a family, the least you could do is try to make her feel more a part of your furry family.  The fact that you make this distinction of the cats being \u201cyours\u201d rather than hers speaks volumes about how you view the relationship with her.  She obviously feels like a bystander and it speaks to a deeper angst that she has being with you.", "FYI the cats own you. A true cat lover would know this.\n\nAlso, YTA for how you're treating your wife.", "YTA. Who cares if she says ours? I feel like this is a problem with marriage today. There's no \"we.\" Pick your battles. Do things that make your wife happy. Get over yourself.", "YTA. \n\nYou started the argument in front of your friend, not your wife. There was no reason to correct her in that moment, and YOU made it awkward for your friend, not your wife. She made a casual comment about the cats, in casual conversation. The only embarrassment was you having to claim ownership in front of your guests, instead of just letting it go. \n\nIf it felt very important for you to clarify that these are YOUR cats, then you could have spoken to her later, not in front of people. And even then, how does her saying \"our cats\" change anything in your life? What impact does it have on you or your cats? Why is this so important to you, and why so important that YOU would start a fight about it in front of other people?\n\nYou created this entire drama, while calling your wife dramatic and ruining things- you did all that, and all over a throwaway comment. \n\nI am sure you and YOUR cats will be very happy living the single life, and I hope your wife runs for the hills.", "YTA. You were the one who embarrassed her in front of your friend and now you are wondering why she reacted like she did and why she won't speak to you? If you don't check yourself you are going to end up alone with your cats.", "YTA and well on the way to living with just your cats. Your wife is your partner in all things.  Money earned by either of you is \"our money\" regardless of one of you earning more or not. The place you live is \"our home\"  regardless of who moved in with who or who pay more of the expenses. And those are \"our cats\" regardless of who does all the work caring for them. You treated your wife horribly in front of your friend, you disrespected her with your behavior then and, TBH, by deciding unilaterally that you are adopting a kitten and obviously giving her no say in the matter.  \n\nFor christs sake man - my husband and I have 8 cats and a roommate who talks about \"our cats\" even though he does not pay any of their expenses or clean up after them.\n\nEither this woman is your wife, you full partner in all things or she is just a live-in f partner. Do her the courtesy of letting her know which she is so she can dump you and find someone who appreciates her.", "YTA\u2014 you *should* have corrected her in private instead of in front of someone. You\u2019d get defensive too if your partner corrected you in front of someone they respect, no? \nWhile yes you are only taking care of them, and they ARE your cats, was it necessary to really make a comment like that?", "YTA. You made an unnecessary comment and went out of your way to humiliate your wife over nothing. The only behavior you should be embarrassed about is your own. \n\nPerhaps you should move out and live with just your cats considering you seem to like them better than you like your WIFE. Why did you marry someone you clearly have no respect for?", "YTA. You have no right to correct her in front of guests. Tbh, I don't see this marriage working either. You clearly have different life goals. She wants kids, but you just want your pets. What's up with that? Did she KNOW you didn't want kids, or did you spring the child free life on her AFTER you were wed?\n\nEdit: OP is the AH.", "Wow. What an ASSHOLE! Has it ever occurred to you to think about her feelings? Maybe you\u2019re doing everything for these cats and she doesn\u2019t even have a chance to do anything for them? She\u2019s trying to have a relationship with them but you\u2019re shutting her out! Yes these cats Were only yours but you\u2019re married now, y\u2019all should share everything. Pretend these were children not animals, can you see how fd up this situation is?", "YTA, of course your wife deserve an apology for your behaviour; you correct her like a child in front of a guest and when she didn\u2019t simply accept your point of view you are saying IN FRONT OF YOUR GUEST how embarrassed you are by her behaviour. You\u2019re the one who started this hole situation. And you are acting like it\u2019s all her fault and you did nothing wrong. My bf had a cat for 5 years before we started dating, the cat lived almost 19 years. I was in the cat life for almost 14 years. I empty the litter box, gave her food, water, treats, brush her, play with her and she would let me do all those things and still hates me. She was bitting me everytime my bf and I were watching a movie, she was jumping on the counter top and pushing my things off of it, she pooped in my overnight bag before we lived together. The cat never liked me even though I was taking better care of her then my boyfriend. It was OUR cat even if it was his before we started dating and even if the cat did like me. You live in the same house, you have animals, they are yours unless you both agree they are yours only. The fact that the cats don\u2019t like her has nothing to do with the care or absence of care she is giving them. Some animals only accepts one human and no amount of trying will change that.", "Yta", "Yep. YTA.", "Dude, YTA fasho.\n\nBut omg not the wife finding the post???", "YTA.  \n\n\nWhen you're married is there is no \"mine\", everything is \"ours\".", "YTA", "She didn\u2019t purposely embarrass you. YOU purposely embarrassed her and she got upset. Why did you feel the need to correct her? You sound like an absolute pain in the ass. You are controlling and there\u2019s obviously a lot more wrong in your marriage than this little spat about semantics. YTA in case it wasn\u2019t clear.", "YTA but not for what happened with your wife recently, but for marry her. For me, when you have pets that love as your own children, you should find a partner that share that love for pets. It\u2019s a deal package. Also she wants children and you don\u2019t, so she is gonna resent you a lot. Do a favor to yourself, to your cats and to your wife and just divorce.", "YTA. Wow. Do you hear yourself? She's right.

You for claiming possession like a kid would and your wife also wanting possession.\n\nLeave the guests out of it. What a pointless argument.", "You guys are both assholes. This marriage is definitely on shaky ground.", "In my experience, if cats do not like someone (and I mean, really dislike--not just are not super friendly) then you really need to take that as a sign because I have rarely found feline opinion to be wrong.  I also question why you married someone who your cats don't like and who doesn't like pets--I mean, it isn't necessarily a deal breaker, however you should have stopped and thought it through!  That's a fundamental difference between you.\n\nHaving said that, ESH.  Stupid thing to confront her about in front of guests.  However she doesn't sound very nice either.   It sounds like you two have a LOT to talk about--because this cannot just be about the cats.", "YTA for the comment. HOWEVER, she is a bigger AH for everything after. Cats are super intelligent when it comes to humans. The reason the cats do not like her is because they know she hates them.", "NTA, I would not share mine either.
