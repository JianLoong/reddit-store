He's my best friend and has a good relationship with my fiance, \"Adrien\" (M24). When we were 12, our parents gifted us a pair of gold necklaces. I received a lock necklace and my brother a key one. The pendants were expensive, and we have been wearing them non-stop since they were given to us.\n\nLast week my sister-in-law bought a pair of necklaces, like mine, for her and her boyfriend. Adrien's family started to make fun of him because his fiance has been wearing other man's pendant. Needless to say, I hate this bully family culture. Adrien usually is a chill person, but is family jokes took a toll on him, and now he's asking me not to wear my necklace when we visit them.\n\nAdrien never minded my necklace before. And I don't want to change anything only because his family is a bunch of bullies. Besides, my brother would be offended if I took it out to comply with their superficial belief that pendants can only mean romantic love. I told Adrien he must impose boundaries on his family. I even offered to take the \"blame\" for it. He can say to them I refuse to step on their house until they stop with their bullshit.\n\nHowever, Adrien is still a little bit angry with me. He says it's a small request for me to keep my necklace in my purse for a few hours every other Saturday, and he also changed some things about himself to accommodate my insecurities. I asked him to stop posting shirtless pics at the gym.\n\nI know he's insecure due to his family bullying, but if we cave in now, they will escalate their \"jokes\" even after we are married.

It's not a big request and you are showing him that you aren't willing to compromise with a reasonable request for his sake.\n\nHis family are horrible though and I agree that taking off the won't change anything. They will still tease and bully him and you. What a terrible way to grow up. Trying to be there for him and support him is really important so he doesn't feel alone. \n\nAsking you to take off the necklace so he isn't teased and bully is a dumb request - cat's out of the bag and it will still happen. He has to stand up to them or ignore them etc. But he asked you, and if it would help his peace of mind even a little it isn't a huge request.", "Goose and gander. You're okay with requesting he change for you, but not you changing for him. The hypocrisy of that is rather glaring. He can change to assuage your insecurities... and he must change to ensure your boundaries.\n\nThat said, I agree that setting boundaries with his family is necessary if they're a bunch of bullies. And setting those boundaries will be difficult: I strongly recommend against blame games in according responsibility when setting them.\n\nI'ma go NAH, soft Y T A (I'm wishy washy) on this one, despite that need, 'cause it feels like your husband is the one doing all of the compromising in your relationship from what you've related.", "ESH except for fiance.

He may think it's weird even.  And then,  his sister goes and gets one for HER BF, reigniting the feeling that he doesn't like it.   The family may say something,  but on some level,  he agrees and asks you to stop wearing it then.\n\nOr,  I could be completely reaching,  in which case you have a BF that is more concerned about giving validity to his family's mean spirited idea that you are romantically involved with your brother, rather than stick up for you... that's not exactly a BETTER scenario, unfortunately...\n\nGood luck", "NTA. Taking off the necklace does nothing. It still exists. Even if he told a weird lie that you\u2019d got rid of it, it still happened. They just sound immature and will still find things to tease him about.", "NTA - Shame on your in-laws for sexualizing your relationship with your brother and shame on Adrian for refusing to stick up for you to his family.

Not buying that.", "NTA - tell him and his family are sick as they think your are f@cking your brother.", "NTA. I think the necklaces represent a beautiful sentiment and anyone seeing it as romantically or sexually charged is being crass and choosing to do so. Also does your fiance honestly see not taking shirtless gym selfies as such a personal loss or sacrifice that seems kind of silly to me. It's also super weird for them to copy you in getting a set of necklaces and then act like you're the one who's strange? I can see why you'd want to draw a line in the sand here and I have never been a fan of bullies. I say you've been wearing the necklace for years and you shouldn't have to take it off and put it in your purse to stop his own family from bullying him that sounds pretty messed up to me. Good luck with this situation I am afraid it may be the first of many to come.", "Seriously.  The lock and key metaphors for men and women are gross at the best of times.\n\nGiving that to your children? It's a bit gross.  But so is the SIL buying a set for her and her betrothed.

I tried to convince him before. But he said it's best to ignore them.", "I'm glad that's the case where you are. In my culture (Southern US) it's pretty on the nose for representing direct intercourse symbolism.", "I think you were totally within your rights to ask him to stop posting those pics and that since he's in a committed relationship with you he shouldn't need all those emoji hearts he should find all the affirmation he needs in your love for him which it's clear you're giving him. I also think you're 100% right that he needs to set a boundary clearly his ignoring them hasn't worked up until now he's a fully formed adult and they're bullying him like kids on the playground. I'm sorry that you're going through this but if it's any consolation from an internet stranger I think you're totally in the right.", "> on the nose for representing direct intercourse symbolism.\n\nOr chastity belts, which implies the man has ownership over the woman's sexuality.", "Yes, this also."]}
