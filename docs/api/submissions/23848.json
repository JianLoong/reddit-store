If you think back to her tone and manner, that's what somebody using subtext to say \"I don't want to talk about this, you have upset me\" looks like.

Even if you had genuine reason to be suspicious - which to be clear in this case you do not - this was a cruel thing to say and I am not in the least surprised your SIL was upset. Also with whatever you were impying had happened with her job, that's just NOT acceptable. What you said goes way beyond social cues and was simply nasty and hurtful.", "YTA.  Are you a geneticist?  No?  Then I suggest you be quiet about things you are obviously ignorant of.  You owe your SIL & Brother a huge apology.

Autistic or not -that\u2019s what you are heavily implying there. What else did you mean by saying that to them????? \n\nFirstly apologise profusely to your SIL. \nSecondly a science lesson. Genetics behind eye colour is actually fairly complex, more so than previously thought. \nHowever to simplify it. There is the dark eye gene (dark brown) and the light eye gene (blue/light brown/hazel/green etc). The dark gene dominates. Each person has 2 genes for eye colour and they inherit one gene from each of their parents. If you have one dark gene and one light -that person will have dark brown eyes but you could pass either the dark gene or the light gene to your child. \nBoth your SIL and your brother have double light genes for eye colour and consequently so does their child. Now other factors determine whether the light gene is expressed as green/hazel/blue etc. So in conclusion there is zero evidence that your SIL has cheated on your brother based on their child\u2019s eye colour. Get it???", "YTA, big time. First of all, green eyes gene is dominant to blue but recessive to brown, so since you like science I\u2019d expect you to remember this important science lesson from middle school and high school: phenotype does not correspond to genotype. Both parents could carry both genes, and they\u2019d only manifest the dominant one (brown eyes). It\u2019s entirely possible for the recessive gene to be passed down and pop up again after generations, if both parents pass down the recessive gene.\n\nWith that said, your SIL is right: you *don\u2019t* have a degree in medicine, and their doctor *does* know better than you. I don\u2019t have much experience either but I was twelve when my sister was born, and I remember perfectly how light her eyes were, they seemed light blue.

They are not fixed by genetically different pigments, but depend on the *amount* of melanin in the eye pigment. All eye colours exist on a spectrum of least melanin to most melanin. People's eye colours can and do normally change over time as the concentration of melanin changes in their eyes. Babies start with slightly lighter coloured eyes.\n\nHazel-brown is only a single shade darker than green, and green itself is only quite a narrow band which is why it's rare. It makes total sense that baby born to people with two people hazel-brown eyes would have green eyes.\n\nHowever, the problem here is not whether or not you knew. It's that you **accused** her of a very serious social transgression (cheating) and then *pressed* her to admit it rather than taking her response at face value.

I also got green eyes in a family with all blue or brown eyes (which makes sense due to dominant and recessive genes.) Otherwise, I look like exactly half my mom and half my dad, and my siblings and I all look so similar it's almost creepy. Mom jokingly says my hair is curly because she got a perm while she was pregnant.", "I read it as \"inbred\" at first lol", "Sloths are adorable!", "My daughter lost her shit when she put a light to her eye and it looked hazel. She wanted her brown eyes back lol. I have green, her dad brown, and my son has blue. You really don\u2019t know what sort of color combos you\u2019re going to get or if they will change (as mine and my son\u2019s have).", "My husband and I both have hazel eyes.  Our kids both have bright blue eyes.  But we each have a parent with blue eyes and since we actually understand biology and genetics we are aware that we both have to carry a blue eye gene and just happened to win the genetic lottery, if you will, in having both passed on the recessive gene both times we conceived.", "Yep my mom has green, dad blue, I'm hazel. So all the alleles are in there to have it go reversed. Especially since they're all recessive. Eye color isn't a mendelian trait.", "my parents have blue and brown eyes and my two siblings and I all have different colored eyes: my brother blue, my sister brown, and me green\n\nlike it's not as simple as \"hazel + hazel = not green\" lol how ridiculous", "My dad has hazel and my mom has green. I got green, one sister got dark brown, and the rest got blue. (And we all look obviously like both sides of the family in various ways. Nobody was cheating.)", "YTA. \nBeing autistic doesn\u2019t give you an excuse. You accused your SIL of having an affair. I know you definitely failed biology because green eyes are a recessive gene, just like red hair is. And a lot of eyes can change color through the persons life. You\u2019ll never have to see the baby anymore because if I was the SIL, I wouldn\u2019t let you see the baby anymore.", "I have green brown hazel eyes. My husband has blue green hazel eyes. I have a blue eyed child, a brown eyed child and a green eyed child. My father's eyes were blue, my mom's brown. Genetics can be a strange thing. You should never imply that any new mom was cheating on her husband. YTA", "My gran said she could always tell if I was ill or not by looking at my eyes. When I'm not well, they look more green than they do when I'm fine. I have a thick, grey rim around the outside of the iris and then mostly green with flecks of brown, grey, and gold scattered through.", "It sounds like you may have central heterocromia. Very cool!", "Mine are similar and also shift to gold and green.", "I see it with mental health in general. Some video of someone being a complete dick and inevitably you\u2019ll see a comment saying they may have some unidentified mental illness. Like nobody is just an asshole anymore.", "Same with my wife and I. We both have brown eyes but my daughter has very light blue, almost grey eyes", "Same here. Husband and I hazel eyes. Both kids blue eyes. His dad & my mom are both blue eyed.", "Exactly. I have autism and I don\u2019t understand some social clues but never ever ever would I say anything obviously rude to someone\u2019s face ever. Because what if that thought is wrong. I talk with my husband about social moments and how I reacted vs what I was thinking and more often than not I still get to say my sister bought sand get it out but I can control not saying something in the moment. It\u2019s just hard and my mouth does this muscle wiggle because I have to actively control myself.\n\nJust cuz I have problems doesn\u2019t mean everyone else has to just suck up me being rude to them \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "I'm 41, actually have ADHD and I don't act like an ass. I actually do the work to keep my issues under control and really don't want anyone to know I have struggles. It isn't a pass for poor behavior. I'm 100% positive those using it as a pass don't actually have it.", "My son (diagnosed with adhd at about age 7), around age 9, tells an adult in our wider social group who had been using her claim of adhd as an excuse for crap behaviour: \u201cADHD is a reason, but not an excuse.\u201d I was so proud of him. \n\nOP, YTA. Do better. Stop pushing your bullshit made up narratives and listen to what people tell you. Did you know that a lot of (white) babies are born with blue eyes and they change colour as they get older?", "I hope you and your child do well.\n\nIt's really upsetting that people who use ADHD as an excuse are making it harder for those clinically diagnosed with ADHD to find a place in society.", "Absolutely. I was diagnosed with anti social personality disorder as a kid and it made me hyper conscious of what\u2019s going on around me. Just because I\u2019m shit at emotion amongst other things, it\u2019s no excuse.", "I hope you do well. And happy cake day! :)", "This is a perfect breakdown of all the reasons why they're the AH and dishonest. Thanks!", "My husband's eyes are dark brown, almost black, so I expected it, particularly since she also inherited most of his coloring and hair. She got a little curl  from me, but hers is thiccccc where mine is very very thin.", "Both of mine had blue eyes at birth. They're hazel now.", "My eyes are blue, my husband's are hazel. Both kids had blue eyes at birth, but have hazel eyes now.", "There was even a set of identical twins born looking like that. Identical twins are not completely identical, having minor differences in DNA, and can be visibly phenotypically different. Apparently, in their case, one of the differences involved the gene for melanin production. But if you looked at their faces you could see they looked very much alike. Just in opposing colour schemes!", "I remember hearing about that and it was enough to tell me that what we learned about genetics in highschool was absolutely the bare minimum!", "We learnt this in high school when studying apartheid.", "Not really, brown inside of green is very typical of hazel.  Another typical combination is brown inside of blue (my sister has that combination).  Outer gray is also typical for hazel (green most common followed by gray and then blue, with brown or gold in the inside).  Google \u201cHazel eyes\u201d and you\u2019ll see the different combinations.\n\nWhat happens with mine (as well as others with hazel eyes), is that the brown will contact or expand at times which makes the green more or less prominent.", "Thank you! She's grown now.  Getting through university was a challenge, but now that she is out in the job market she's doing great (she's in sales).  She still struggles, mostly with interpersonal relationships but things are always improving through her hard work.", "I'm so sorry to hear about your diagnosis. That one's a bear to deal with. Good for you for choosing to be better :)", "Thank you! I'll enjoy my cake \ud83d\ude0a", "You\u2019re welcome!", "This is exactly my situation - one blue eyed parent, one hazel eyed parent, one child born with blue eyes that turned hazel.", "Not to be weird, but your eyes sound very pretty. \ud83d\ude0a", "I absolutely don\u2019t a lot of the time. But I know what I am and that\u2019s a lot of the problem, helps me ask myself what would Henry Cavill do or some shit!", "I don\u2019t know. I think that OP was an AH for reasons other than not having imperfect understanding of biology.", "hahaha, thanks.", "Not my claim either.\n\nShe would be a bigger AH for thinking she is an expert on biology, make false claims at the worst possible time and ruining her brothers and SIL party because of it.\n\nRead a room, If you can't, don't speak up."]}
