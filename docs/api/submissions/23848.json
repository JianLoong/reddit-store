You knew EXACTLY what you were suggesting and how offensive it would be. You were suggesting your sister in law had an affair and was trying to pass of the child as your brother's.

I promise, you know less about this shit than a medical doctor.\n\n2. It's rude as hell to accuse somebody of an affair, especially in public. You should have led with \"it's *curious* that the baby has green eyes, do you know why that might be?\" rather than \"it's *suspicious*\". \n\nYou jumped to that accusation so fast it looks like you wanted her to be cheating on your brother. And if you didn't? Free \"how people work\" lesson, always ask for somebody's explanation without accusing them of wrongdoing, even if you're sure there can't be an alternative. As this little episode shows, sometimes you're wrong and you'll have done a whole lot less damage to the relationship with an \"I don't understand\" than a \"j'accuse\".\n\nAlso, \"my doctor said this is normal\" was her shutting down that line of conversation. If you think back to her tone and manner, that's what somebody using subtext to say \"I don't want to talk about this, you have upset me\" looks like. You then doubling down on not only the question but the accusation (\"are you sure nothing happened after your night job\" can only mean \"are you sure you weren't having an affair \" or \"did you forget that time you were raped\", both independently very rude) is why she then kicked you out.", "YTA - And need to do some reading on  basic genetics because babies of European descent are almost always born with blue, grey or green eyes and then many will either darken or even change colour by the time they are between 1-2,  but, remedial reading aside, it is NEVER acceptable to question a babies paternity to either parent in that way. Even if you had genuine reason to be suspicious - which to be clear in this case you do not - this was a cruel thing to say and I am not in the least surprised your SIL was upset. Also with whatever you were impying had happened with her job, that's just NOT acceptable. What you said goes way beyond social cues and was simply nasty and hurtful.", "YTA.  Are you a geneticist?  No?  Then I suggest you be quiet about things you are obviously ignorant of.  You owe your SIL & Brother a huge apology.

Autistic or not -that\u2019s what you are heavily implying there. What else did you mean by saying that to them????? \n\nFirstly apologise profusely to your SIL. \nSecondly a science lesson. Genetics behind eye colour is actually fairly complex, more so than previously thought. \nHowever to simplify it. There is the dark eye gene (dark brown) and the light eye gene (blue/light brown/hazel/green etc). The dark gene dominates. Each person has 2 genes for eye colour and they inherit one gene from each of their parents. If you have one dark gene and one light -that person will have dark brown eyes but you could pass either the dark gene or the light gene to your child. \nBoth your SIL and your brother have double light genes for eye colour and consequently so does their child. Now other factors determine whether the light gene is expressed as green/hazel/blue etc. So in conclusion there is zero evidence that your SIL has cheated on your brother based on their child\u2019s eye colour. Get it???", "YTA, big time. First of all, green eyes gene is dominant to blue but recessive to brown, so since you like science I\u2019d expect you to remember this important science lesson from middle school and high school: phenotype does not correspond to genotype. Both parents could carry both genes, and they\u2019d only manifest the dominant one (brown eyes). It\u2019s entirely possible for the recessive gene to be passed down and pop up again after generations, if both parents pass down the recessive gene.\n\nWith that said, your SIL is right: you *don\u2019t* have a degree in medicine, and their doctor *does* know better than you. I don\u2019t have much experience either but I was twelve when my sister was born, and I remember perfectly how light her eyes were, they seemed light blue.

They are not fixed by genetically different pigments, but depend on the *amount* of melanin in the eye pigment. All eye colours exist on a spectrum of least melanin to most melanin. People's eye colours can and do normally change over time as the concentration of melanin changes in their eyes. Babies start with slightly lighter coloured eyes.\n\nHazel-brown is only a single shade darker than green, and green itself is only quite a narrow band which is why it's rare. It makes total sense that baby born to people with two people hazel-brown eyes would have green eyes.\n\nHowever, the problem here is not whether or not you knew. It's that you **accused** her of a very serious social transgression (cheating) and then *pressed* her to admit it rather than taking her response at face value.

When people start questioning the trust between individuals in a couple, some effects can be: making someone feel unworthy or less than, making someone feel like you dont take them seriously in a relationship role, or making them feel like you dont take their relationship seriously.

At least 8 directly control eye colour. \n\nSo one gene controls brown-blue spectrum, but then others can modify how much melanin is produced.

With the hobbits.", "I get that all the time off my boyfriend - usually when he\u2019s frustrated, he\u2019ll go through 3 or 4 different words in different languages till he remembers which one he\u2019s meant to be speaking. \n\nHe used to speak in all sorts of languages in his sleep but rarely English when we first met, apart from the night he sat up suddenly and opened his eyes and looked at me and said \u201cI AM THE BATMAN!\u201d\n\nNow it\u2019s mostly English and it\u2019s usually hilarious, last week he said \u201cOh no Kevin ate my car keys\u201d \n\nNeither of us know anyone called Kevin \ud83e\udd23. \nNever boring living with my boy!", "Wasn\u2019t even an ask, it was an accusation", "I'm shit with social interactions and even I know better than to say that. I gave someone I dated a free pass to be an asshole to me whenever just because he claimed he was autistic. Refuse to excuse this behavior for anyone anymore - knowing the capabilities/potential of an autistic person.", "If an inborn toenail had green eyes that would be suspicious.", "I really want to know what kind of 5th rate college OP is studying biology at because I learned about ressesive genes in middle school.", "Inborn is actually a word that aligns with our 'newborn'.  This person likely doesn't speak English as a first language. \nOP YTA. You have no idea what you're talking about what so ever. First off, you clearly don't understand how genes and traits pass down. Second of all, the color of a babies eyes at birth are rarely their true eye color- which takes a while to really show up. Using your austism as an excuse to sexually harassing your sister (by accusing her of having an affair) and be an awful human is NOT acceptable."]}
