Nice enough that your husband is willing to sleep on the floor but it's not just his choice, and it's VERY reasonable for you to want to share the bed with your husband in private for your trip not with his sister who just decided to show up while he sleeps on the floor.\n\nAnd yeah, to your point, Tokyo to LA isn't a cheap flight. Upwards of $500 round trip at BEST if you can pick dates around when flights are cheap. Upwards of $1k is not unusual. If she can afford that she can afford another $300 for a hotel.\n\nYour husband is being unreasonable to think he just gets to make this decision for you without consulting you and even if you aren't ok with it.", "NTA. So he volunteered you to share a bed with her? Not cool.", "NTA, I would absolutely not share a room, what nonsense. I have stayed at CitizenM hotels and the rooms are tiny without any extra bedding. What is she going to do? Sleep on a bare floor without a cover?\nFurthermore, all guests are supposed to be checked in, this is for safety purposes and it's soooooooo cheap sneak into someone else's room.", "NTA\n\nIf she can't afford her own room, she can't go.", "NTA tell your husband since her comfort is more important then yours that they can stay home and you will find a friend to go.\n\nLet him host.", "This is so tacky of her.\n\nYou can either tell your husband you guess he's fine with sex being completely off the table (with a 3 party in the room) or you can get your own hotel room to enjoy on your own.
