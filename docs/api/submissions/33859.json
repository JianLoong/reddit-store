Upwards of $500 round trip at BEST if you can pick dates around when flights are cheap. Upwards of $1k is not unusual.

I'd like to add that if the room is that small, the hotel may not even allow for triple occupancy. Awfully presumptuous of them to think she can just crash without checking on this.\n\nP.S. okay, so I was curious and I looked at CitizenM online, and it looks like they do NOT allow triple occupancy in any of their rooms.
