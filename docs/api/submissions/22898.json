One day I was hanging out by her pool in a really cute bikini which I got from the event and was just happy while my family showed up. I tried to go to my room to dress up, while my aunt tried to hold them by the door to give me time to leave, but they just entered and when they saw me they just started laughing, telling me bikinis are for woman not l**y***s, I was like so shocked as this is new low even for them, but once they got the reaction out of me they started saying all kinds of things to hurt me, but I was like fuck it and took off my tops and started sunbathing like my dad and brother.

They slut shamed me and left, I didn't care and my aunt didn't care but My sister messaged me the next day telling me to never contact them again and what I did was very disrespectful etc. Now that it's been a few days I'm wondering, as I did subject them to unconsensual nudity and made them uncomfortable.", "created_utc": 1690044290, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/156oydo/aita_for_going_topless_in_a_family_event/", "score": 789, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
