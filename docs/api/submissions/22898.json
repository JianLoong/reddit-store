After moving out I'm not in contact with them.&#10;  \nI live in a big city in a small apartment with my dog, recently I got an opportunity to walk a runway, it's not a big show, but still a big deal for me. I was very happy as one of the person walked with me was a very big model, although we didn't interact I was very happy to be in the same event as her. Before the show they took professional pics of all of us and I thought my pictures were very cute, so I posted a few and a lot of people praised me but my dad and brother posted laughing and the man emojis. One pic I was topless but covered myself with my hands, the focus was my abs and my bracelet. I thought I looked cool, but they started commenting like what's even there for you to cover and all the nasty things, people who didn't know they were my family tore them apart in the comments but I felt bad, so I disabled the comments.&#10;  \nA few weeks later there was a party at my aunt's house, she is my favourite, so I decided to stay a few days after the party. One day I was hanging out by her pool in a really cute bikini which I got from the event and was just happy while my family showed up. I tried to go to my room to dress up, while my aunt tried to hold them by the door to give me time to leave, but they just entered and when they saw me they just started laughing, telling me bikinis are for woman not l**y***s, I was like so shocked as this is new low even for them, but once they got the reaction out of me they started saying all kinds of things to hurt me, but I was like fuck it and took off my tops and started sunbathing like my dad and brother. There was a big silence for almost 5mins and my aunt started laughing and told me to put on sunscreen on my chest area and I did and suddenly there was a huge commotion like everyone was yelling at everyone, so I was like what's even there to see as I have no boobs, while my dad and brother has dadbods, huge boobs with a beer belly. They slut shamed me and left, I didn't care and my aunt didn't care but My sister messaged me the next day telling me to never contact them again and what I did was very disrespectful etc. Now that it's been a few days I'm wondering, as I did subject them to unconsensual nudity and made them uncomfortable.", "created_utc": 1690044290, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/156oydo/aita_for_going_topless_in_a_family_event/", "score": 216, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
