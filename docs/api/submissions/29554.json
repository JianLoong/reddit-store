To increase their sadistic glee they wanted you to try each piece that they already knew wouldn't fit.\n\nIt was just a terrible and cruel prank.  You should have cast them out immediately.  I'm sure they've been doing this kind of thing since forever.  Time for it to end.  You need to go very low contact.  Call them on holidays and avoid in-person visits.  Do not invite or allow them to come over - because, guaranteed they are working on the next prank.\n\nIgnoring your instruction was disrespectful and deliberate.  And then they tried to gaslight you by saying you hurt THEIR feelings ( by not trying on the rest and continuing the prank. )\n\nNO.  This isn't family - these people are just bullies.", "NTA. It was terrible of them to not respect your wishes and try to guess your size and what looks good on you. If they were insistent on getting your clothes, they could have offered to go shopping with you, so that you could pick what you are interested in and try it on. OR they could have asked you for a store you like or would like to buy clothing from and gotten you a gift card. Or just the things you asked for.", "NTA. Somehow it felt like they were mocking you and your body. Intentional or not, I think there is an element of bullying and fatphobia going on. Insisting on buying you clothing as a \"gift\", buying you clothing that don't suit/fit you, insisting you try said clothing on and then guilt tripping you by calling you ungrateful - all of it feels a little malicious.", "NTA.\n\nI\u2019m a plus sized woman myself and grew up bigger as well. \n\nThis is clearly them not respecting your wants and desires. To the point that it feels like they don\u2019t respect you. Usually I\u2019ll give smaller people the benefit of the doubt (in some cases) because they have really have no what it\u2019s like to be fat. But you were clear with them. They got you clothes anyways, ignored you and then pressured you to a degree that it\u2019s kind of insulting. \n\nIt also put you in a (whether they realize it or not) vulnerable and most likely embarrassing position of trying things you know won\u2019t fit and won\u2019t look good. It\u2019s more than just trying on clothes, it\u2019s feeling excluded, not appreciated, and bad about your body. Then they set you up to thank them for a shitty gift that is unusable to you. \n\nIt really feels like classic mean girl mentality where they want to see you fail, then giggle and feel better about themselves in the process. To put it plainly bullying you.\n\nI always hated when family members would get me clothes for holidays or birthdays. Somehow thin people have just no idea what size plussize people really are, and think \u201coh a large will fit\u201d. When it usually isn\u2019t the case and anyways everyone carries their weight in differently. So clothing is tricky, even if someone knows your exact size. You could be busty and can only fit certain tops, or wide in the hips and thighs and need specific pants brands. So not only is your pool of clothing smaller in store or online, it\u2019s a super specific trial and error. \n\nIt\u2019s more personal than people who have never experienced it realize.\n\nI\u2019m sorry this happened to you, OP. But you aren\u2019t ungrateful. They\u2019re inconsiderate and disrespectful.", "NTA These people are trash, why the heck are you letting them anywhere near you? Blood? Who the frick cares, blood means as much as water on a pig's butt, you can't drink it and even the pig hates it.", "NTA. Why on Earth did you try them on for them? So you could feel worse about their self-indulgent presents? Protect yourself better. \n\nPossible responses: \"No thank you.\" Hand them back the clothes. Leave.", "NTA it was rude of them to not respect your wishes.", "NTA. They overstepped big time.", "NTA They disrespected your wishes repeatedly and the cherry on top is your sister laughing and saying well it was cheap why not. Really?!", "Of course NTA they asked what you wanted, you gave them easy, specific advice.\n\nThey asked your size, you made it clear multiple times you didn't want clothes and they bought it anyway.", "Are you sure your related? Sounds like an enemy tbh. Your not the AH they are because I\u2019m sorry but that\u2019s straight out malicious bullying. I know how you feel as I was almost 300 pds 3 yrs ago. Found out I had a carb intolerance so I would gain more weight from a sandwich than eating sausage. I maybe down to 170 now but I still won\u2019t talk to my sisters that picked on me. It\u2019s up to you but why accept abuse when your fine with who you are regardless of size.", "NTA. \nI am so sorry that they ignored your wishes and disrespected you so terribly on your birthday, which should be a happy day. \n\nThey were mean, and rude, and their accusations are a nonsense. \nThey should apologise to you.\n\nCalling their gifts to you \"cheap\" is adding insult to injury. \n\n Remember this on their birthdays, and get them an empty paper bag to carry their kindness in.", "NTA I am not plus sized but I have given up on asking people not to buy me clothes. I am just hard to fit because I am high waisted and a little busty. Now when someone gives me clothes, I say thank you politely and drop the clothes off at Goodwill. It's their money to waste and someone may want or need the clothes. They aren't going to stop so just give the stuff to charity", "NTA\n\nI hope you have a gift receipt and can return everything. That is just thoughtless and wasteful of them.", "NTA. \n\nBut this has an easy solution.  I am hard to fit also. I thank people who buy me clothes and just return them.to.the store. No muss, no fuss. \n\nWhy are you wasting time getting upset at people who.not.only don't get it but will never get it?", "NTA. Your family sounds toxic! You are not ungrateful for not apprectiating something you explicitely did not want to have.", "NTA  but with a very soft  y t a  note. \n\nI speak as someone who used to be in your position. This pain and hurt you feel won\u2019t go away even if you lose weight and become of a similar size to that of your family. You\u2019re still not going to enjoy having clothes gifted to you. \nNot wanting to be gifted clothes is a very clear and simple wish/boundary. I bet you all I have that your family has often acted like they know what\u2019s best for you, that you\u2019ve felt judged and maybe talked to in a condescending or insulting way, even if they didn\u2019t realise they were doing so. \n\nThe AH part is due to your outburst. You need to communicate your pain better without lashing at others. But it\u2019s a very soft one because I\u2019m also sure this is the first time your voice has been ignored and I know there are probably several factors in how people treat you that contribute to your frustration. \n\nIt seems to me like your relatives are acting self centred and focusing only on how they feel. \nMaybe sitting down with them and explaining all the dehumanising, embarrassing and depressing things you\u2019ve experienced in your life might make them see how their nonchalant approach hurt you.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
