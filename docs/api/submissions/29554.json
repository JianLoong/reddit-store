To increase their sadistic glee they wanted you to try each piece that they already knew wouldn't fit.\n\nIt was just a terrible and cruel prank.  You should have cast them out immediately.  I'm sure they've been doing this kind of thing since forever.  Time for it to end.  You need to go very low contact.  Call them on holidays and avoid in-person visits.  Do not invite or allow them to come over - because, guaranteed they are working on the next prank.\n\nIgnoring your instruction was disrespectful and deliberate.  And then they tried to gaslight you by saying you hurt THEIR feelings ( by not trying on the rest and continuing the prank. )\n\nNO.  This isn't family - these people are just bullies.", "NTA. It was terrible of them to not respect your wishes and try to guess your size and what looks good on you. If they were insistent on getting your clothes, they could have offered to go shopping with you, so that you could pick what you are interested in and try it on. OR they could have asked you for a store you like or would like to buy clothing from and gotten you a gift card. Or just the things you asked for.", "NTA. Somehow it felt like they were mocking you and your body. Intentional or not, I think there is an element of bullying and fatphobia going on. Insisting on buying you clothing as a \"gift\", buying you clothing that don't suit/fit you, insisting you try said clothing on and then guilt tripping you by calling you ungrateful - all of it feels a little malicious.", "NTA.\n\nI\u2019m a plus sized woman myself and grew up bigger as well. \n\nThis is clearly them not respecting your wants and desires. To the point that it feels like they don\u2019t respect you. Usually I\u2019ll give smaller people the benefit of the doubt (in some cases) because they have really have no what it\u2019s like to be fat. But you were clear with them. They got you clothes anyways, ignored you and then pressured you to a degree that it\u2019s kind of insulting. \n\nIt also put you in a (whether they realize it or not) vulnerable and most likely embarrassing position of trying things you know won\u2019t fit and won\u2019t look good. It\u2019s more than just trying on clothes, it\u2019s feeling excluded, not appreciated, and bad about your body. Then they set you up to thank them for a shitty gift that is unusable to you. \n\nIt really feels like classic mean girl mentality where they want to see you fail, then giggle and feel better about themselves in the process. To put it plainly bullying you.\n\nI always hated when family members would get me clothes for holidays or birthdays. Somehow thin people have just no idea what size plussize people really are, and think \u201coh a large will fit\u201d. When it usually isn\u2019t the case and anyways everyone carries their weight in differently. So clothing is tricky, even if someone knows your exact size. You could be busty and can only fit certain tops, or wide in the hips and thighs and need specific pants brands. So not only is your pool of clothing smaller in store or online, it\u2019s a super specific trial and error. \n\nIt\u2019s more personal than people who have never experienced it realize.\n\nI\u2019m sorry this happened to you, OP.

I am just hard to fit because I am high waisted and a little busty. Now when someone gives me clothes, I say thank you politely and drop the clothes off at Goodwill.

This pain and hurt you feel won\u2019t go away even if you lose weight and become of a similar size to that of your family. You\u2019re still not going to enjoy having clothes gifted to you. \nNot wanting to be gifted clothes is a very clear and simple wish/boundary. I bet you all I have that your family has often acted like they know what\u2019s best for you, that you\u2019ve felt judged and maybe talked to in a condescending or insulting way, even if they didn\u2019t realise they were doing so. \n\n(Sorry for what was written here earlier about you having an outburst, I completely misread a line)\n\nI\u2019m sure this is the first time your voice has been ignored and I know there are probably several factors in how people treat you that contribute to your frustration. \n\nIt seems to me like your relatives are acting self centred and focusing only on how they feel. \nMaybe (if you care about your relationship with them) sitting down with them and explaining all the dehumanising, embarrassing and depressing things you\u2019ve experienced in your life might make them see how their nonchalant approach hurt you.\n\nEDIT: I had misread OP\u2019s post and thought she had a different reaction.

If they bought crop tops and tube tops for me I would be livid. This is not something you buy for someone else. Ever.", "Or buy them cheap clothes that are way too big. Or adult diapers size XXL since they are behaving like overgrown children.", "Bet you 10 buck those siblings will take the clothes because \"they don't fit you anyways\" nta, I hope my siblings don't turn out like this", "I hope OP cuts all those people out of her life before then. They sound super toxic.", "Well, that's a nice, passive means of ignoring the real issue. The OP isn't complaining about the clothes so much as she is about the fact her family clearly disrespects and dismisses her. She asked plainly and repeatedly that they not get her clothes, and they not only ignored her, they bought her, among other things, *a tube top.* I wouldn't be surprised if they bought stuff they knew would be too small as a means of pressuring her to lose weight.", "She doesn't have clothes because it's difficult to find clothes that fit her, not because she won't go out and buy random shit. The proof of that being, she doesn't have any more clothes now that her family decided to pull this stunt, because the clothes they got do. Not. Fit. Her.", "That\u2019s a fascinating interpretation", "buying clothes as a gift is not rare. People would do this shit to me all the time in my hometown and it was annoying since I had to force myself to act like I liked it. My MIL often buys me PJs which I do like. \n\nThis is definitely mean girl bulls!t though. OPs family treats her like garbage.", "really? I mean, I don't really count PJs, socks or underwear as clothes in this case (those are favourite Christmas present in my parts \ud83d\ude02). but noone here would gift someone pair of pants or a shirt as a gift, especially between adults.", "She gives me other stuff too lol. The only werid, inappropriate gift was something that she gave along with the millions of other gifts that I got at my bridal shower. The weird gift was the only thing I returned.\n\n\nBut yeah even in college I would have family friends from my hometown telling me they had bought some gifts for me. I need to try them on since they were clothes. Im 5'3 and until recently was pretty thin all my life. My momma passed when I was a kid so I think they thought they were helping me look nice. It was basically stuff an older lady thought a teenager and then college student would wear... I only time I was actually happy about the clothes is when I was taken shopping for stuff. That only happened twice, with two different people that didn't watch me grow up."]}
