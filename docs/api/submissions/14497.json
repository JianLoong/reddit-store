You did nothing wrong.", "I am so naive!  Honestly, it never even occurred to me that someone might use an electric toothbrush as a vibrator.  Why would you think of that when buying such a gift?  \n\nMy response would likely be along the lines of, \"If I were going to get her a toy, I'd have done it right and just gotten her an actual vibrator.\"  Especially if I were going to answer for my sister's actions anyway.
