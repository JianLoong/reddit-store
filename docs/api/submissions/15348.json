Goodness, she needs an attitude adjustment. You are not her serf. I hope she doesn't have anything important in that purse, because if she is that forgetful she must leave it a lot of places. Or - if she doesn't - then this is some weird powerplay by her on you.", "NTA. If it's so frequent that you say it's 'every time', it's a power move.

As someone who *does* have ADHD, having to physically go and get whatever dumb thing you forgot is one of the best ways to not have to go get it again in the future.

My siblings and I would do the same thing to one another when we were young. Example; trivial items spoon, fork, remote, hat ect... not to shit on your wife entirely her love language, maybe \"acts of service,\" (idk) and these small gofer trips for her are just reaffirming in her mind that your heart is in the right place.

So you are doing exactly the right thing.  She's being ridiculous, you aren't her minion, you're her husband.

It's not like she's antagonizing you on purpose, some people are just forgetful, but it is reasonable to want her to deal with her own stuff. That said, I don't think this is a great hill to die on for either of you. Maybe have a discussion about how frustrated you feel before abruptly changing your behavior, bc the way you handled this, while understandable, is a little immature. If somebody suddenly changes their expectations of you without warning, it's normal to be annoyed, so I understand where she's coming from too. This isn't a you vs your wife issue, this is a you and your wife vs forgotten items issue, imo.\n\nAlso, for the ppl saying this is a power play: that's really uncharitable towards someone you know very little about. When someone routinely does something nice for you, it's typical to start to expect it, not in an \"I deserve it\" entitlement way but in a \"this is what usually happens\" way. I am the long term partner of an EXTREMELY forgetful person, so I feel this frustration, but when something annoys one of us we talk abt it right then and come up with a plan of action. If we start to slip out of that plan, we have another talk abt what we want from each other. I don't mind going back for her things sometimes, because 1. She understands that it's not a guarantee (because we've talked about it) and 2. She does plenty of inconvenient things to help me too.

The only way for me to have cleavage is to stuff it with something... phone, keys, money", "I think some people are saying \u201cbag\u201d when they mean \u201cpurse\u201d and some people are also saying messenger bags are the same as purses. Stylistically they aren\u2019t, functionally very similar. And then of course add in backpacks.\n\nI\u2019m also guessing this is divided between city and suburban/rural for the US. Basically if you live in a city and take public transport, walk, or bike to wherever you are going, then you are taking a bag. If you live in the suburbs/rural, then you keep things in your car and don\u2019t stress about a bag (unless you are carrying work equipment).", "iPhone does it! Not sure about android. If you shop at multiple locations I think you have to use multiple reminders though", "NERRRRRD!", "I always like add apathy to that statement also, I.e. explained by incompetence or apathy.\n\nAlot of people just don't think enough or care enough about the consequences of their actions.\n\nIts not common that you'll find someone who goes out of their way purely out of spite (though they most certainly do exist).", "We're allowed to have different opinions. I just don't default to \"everyone has malicious intentions.\"", "Felt this, I\u2019d upvote you ten times if I could.

Pockets that I sometimes have to bend at the waist a little to reach the bottom of. And I'm so forgetful I know I'd lose a purse every time.", "YEAH! Could fit my CD player in them shits for school trips.", "I still have a pair going strong! Also a pair of skater trousers with the deepest pockets I've ever had. I refuse to throw them out. I don't care that I've shrunk and now look like I'm swimming in them.", "I love Duluth! My favorite jacket is from them, and I (a woman) feel opulent as hell with the amount of pockets it has and the number of things I can carry when I wear it", "and 5.11s have the durability that makes them still worthwhile to take with you.  I still have my original two pair of khaki ones from 2015 and one of those was covered thigh to knee with excavator grease from a bucket change and they came completely clean.", "Absolutely not! The only reason my wife keeps me around is because my clothes have pockets - if she had pockets I'd have no more purpose in my life!", "I hang mine on the handle of the front door so I literally have to grab them to leave.", "Yes.", "This is the way and you are both my people \ud83d\ude02 my original set that\u2019s like 7 years old is just finally retiring due to hole from catching them on shit while farming. Best pants a human can own \ud83d\ude0f", "I'm sure that you'd still be useful in other ways. Like, for example, I'd still need mine around to reach things for me because I'm 5'1 and I can't reach shit.", "NTA but you're also not doing your relationship any favors if you ultimately decide to die on this hill. You know your wife is forgetful, that is something about her that you are both aware of. It is sweet of you to have been willing to assist her in this manner over the years. It's not required of you, but it is kind and shows your affection. By \"refusing to do it\" anymore, you unwittingly demonstrate the opposite of affection. \n\nShould she be angry or annoyed at you? No. Are you demonstrating your appreciation of her, or a giving nature when you flatly refuse to assist further? Also no. Therefore, I think it's advisable to make your point heard but not overcorrect and remain flexible out of love for your partner. Perhaps ask her to run mini errands for you sometimes as well? Maybe grab you a beverage or a roll of toilet paper?", "My partner is disabled and it's still annoying when he's constantly forgetting his phone in the car. I now say \"Got your phone?\" When we get out of the car. NTA", "I'm stumped about why she would expect you to keep getting it for her? And her sister agrees too? NTA.", "NTA- I am physically disabled (not in a wheelchair) and I still go get things myself most of the time if I forget them.  I do ask my boyfriend if I am having a really bad day, but I rarely forget things, so I don't need to ask for his help very often (when it comes to forgetting things in the car).\n\nShe can get her things.  I'll bet she'll start remembering pretty quickly.", "NTA this is weaponized incompetence. She is grown and you aren't her parent.", "She needs to be an adult and take care of her own stuff.", "Can't help but think it's some sort of power move on her part if it's every single time and she gets angry if you say no.", "NTA. She's got a bad habit that will eventually end in your car getting broken into and her purse being stolen. If it wasn't a big deal, your wife and SIL wouldn't have been so heated about you saying no. Being a gentleman is wonderful, and should not be taken for granted like that.", "NTA \nAnd instead she is.  Your car is going to get broken into if she continues to leave valuables for all to see.", "NTA. \n\nIn my country we used to say \"Who doesn't have in head, has in the legs.\" - meaning that if you're mindless enough to forget it, you'll need to go to fetch it.", "NTA. But bro, your wife has a challenge. She forgets her purse a lot. Likely because she is thinking about other things. You can refuse to get it for her, deliberately setting yourself against her and acting like her dad instead of her partner. Or you can lean in and care enough to help her remember it in the first place. It costs you nothing to check first for her and gains you so much more.", "Nta beat her to it, forget something in the car next time then ask her to grab it. Repeat\n\nAlso, this may not be good advice", "With edit 1,2,3 \u2026 and before that \u2026 I\u2019m voting: NTA.   \n\n\nIt\u2019s her stuff. She\u2019s got two good legs. She\u2019s being lazy.   \n\n\nIt is nice to do things occasionally for other people, but when it becomes habitual you wind up becoming their servant. No thanks.", "I replaced my purse with a fanny pack to solve this problem for myself. I never leave it anywhere because it\u2019s attached! NTA but maybe get her a cute one as a peace offering?", "Exactly. People say stuff like this and then get mad when I go back down that road. That's a two-way road, bud", "Yes, or until her stuff gets stolen from the car or the restaurant she forgets it at. You\u2019re not her errand boy, OP! (and I\u2019m a wife too)", "I don\u2019t understand why he should get her stuff to begin with.", "Is that a copied response from OP?\n\nIt is. Nice. Glad they did that", "Hahaha I\u2019m adhd and forget stuff all the time. I can\u2019t even IMAGINE demanding that a partner go and retrieve it for me \ud83d\ude02. \n\nIf I was busy with my arms full of kids or changing a nappy or something then sure\u2026but \u201cjust because\u201d ?

If you leave anything visible...", "The truth is they don\u2019t care if you notice the faulty reasoning and if you point it out they get mad at you", "Maybe she does a lot of other things he doesnt, then probably uses that as ammunition to get what she wants.", "There was another good post where the girlfriend, who usually drives them, always makes a point of getting in the car, setting down her purse, putting on her seatbelt, spending at least 20-30 seconds puttering around before unlocking the passenger door for her boyfriend. She'd do it in the pouring rain or even if he was carrying something painfully heavy--and she did it for years. It was a total power play. This post reminds me of it a lot.", "Yep I have done that lots too!", "lmaooo my dad does this too", "I found cargo capris pants for women with huge pockets and I LOVE THEM.

Being punished when he says no?", "Did you (she) check if they had security cameras?", "He won't admit it but, I swear my father bought a Mazda miata so he wouldn't have to drive carpool anymore....and he definitely didn't factor in my 6'5 brother who was away at college ever coming home for a visit \ud83e\udd23", "Half the guys I work with carry a backpack into work with them. The other half have these computer bags/soft briefcases that they use instead.
