It's not like she's antagonizing you on purpose, some people are just forgetful, but it is reasonable to want her to deal with her own stuff. That said, I don't think this is a great hill to die on for either of you. Maybe have a discussion about how frustrated you feel before abruptly changing your behavior, bc the way you handled this, while understandable, is a little immature. If somebody suddenly changes their expectations of you without warning, it's normal to be annoyed, so I understand where she's coming from too. This isn't a you vs your wife issue, this is a you and your wife vs forgotten items issue, imo.\n\nAlso, for the ppl saying this is a power play: that's really uncharitable towards someone you know very little about.

I am the long term partner of an EXTREMELY forgetful person, so I feel this frustration, but when something annoys one of us we talk abt it right then and come up with a plan of action. If we start to slip out of that plan, we have another talk abt what we want from each other. I don't mind going back for her things sometimes, because 1. She understands that it's not a guarantee (because we've talked about it) and 2. She does plenty of inconvenient things to help me too.

Did you start going home for bags when you forgot them, or did you buy them so you'd remember next time?\n\nSorry if my brain isn't working right now, just curious I'd like to beat the bad habit of forgetting shopping bags too lol", "Not that he\u2019s aware of - ADHD often goes undiagnosed in women and girls. (Not saying she does but just because she\u2019s not diagnosed doesn\u2019t mean she doesn\u2019t have it).\n\nEither way, she should still get her own stuff. I wouldn\u2019t expect someone else to be retrieving all the things I forget.", "She gets to excercise control over her husband, that\u2019s the motive", "I don't see the difference in me saying I was no longer going to be doing it and telling her that she has to?", "No is a complete sentence. She is an adult perfectly capable of managing her own property. What does she do when she goes somewhere alone? Does she ask her family and friends to keep track of her purse?\n\nIt is not incumbent upon him to train her to remember her purse when she seemingly has no problem taking care of her things when he's not around.", "Why can't it be about his feelings AND her actual behavior? Why does it matter if it's about his feelings on the matter?\n\nThe way OP framed it isn't any different than what you said", "So treating her like a child that needs to learn a lesson is ok, but being honest about how her behavior personally affects her spouse is not?", "So months, if not years of pestering means op can't express their feelings? to their partner of all people.. make it make sense.", "My boyfriend has a very large water bottle that he sits in the floor of the passenger seat floor board. He always has it with him so I know it's important to him. If he doesn't grab it when getting out, I always do. And just when I start standing up out of the car, he says \"can you get my water\" and I proudly hold it up like \"already got it.\" \n\nAnyway, my point was I don't know where OP's wife puts her purse, but mine always goes in the passenger floorboard or on top of the center console, so it's always near me. I don't understand how this is such a problem, if you need it, grab it. And if you care about your partner, grab it.", "It isn't about chivalry though. It is about her forgetting and not getting off her arse to go and get it.\n\nBy the sounds of it she wouldn't do it for him.", "I'm glad you do. But this more like taking advantage of him", "This is the way.", "tsk tsk men these days. He shouldn't have a bag or have you carrying his stuff, he should just be wearing tacky cargo shorts with many pockets that he stuffs all his stuff into like his forefathers did when men were men.", "Right, I meant I made myself leave the grocery store and go back to the car when I forgot them. Took a few times but I eventually learned.", "They live in the trunk. I would go back to the car every time I forgot.", "Why does it always have to be some kind of disorder? Sometimes people are forgetful, careless, rude and there is no underlying medical/mental issue. \nShe forgets it because she knows she can guilt her husband into getting it for her.", "I don't really buy that, just based on the OP text. She just seems like a forgetful ditz. \n\nSource: I'm one too", "There isn't one, ignore these people. She's gotten used to you getting up and being inconvenienced so she doesn't have to. Don't let anyone, including her, make you feel bad about it.", "There is no difference if you look at it as the end result being that you won't go get her forgotten things, she will need to do it. \n\nBut if you think about the impact of the words you chose, turning it around as the above person suggested is a softer sell and hits less hard.  Some people just react better to that method.\n\nI don't think you're wrong here, that would drive me bonkers after awhile, too, and I'd have to have a sit-down about it.  But my own partner responds better, as do I, with the softer sell.", "The reason, IMO; why it's YTA is that it's not the behavior that's the issue but the way the behavior makes him feel. The root issue with this entire thing isn't that she forgets stuff in the car but that he gets annoyed at what happens when she forgets stuff in the car.\n\nHe already pre-framed this conversation by the fact that the behavior annoys him and they had discussed that it annoyed him. While the conversation that occurred for this event may have been expressed better, the crux of all this is just that he feels annoyed by it.\n\nShe can't control how he feels about her behavior and framing it in that ways is unfair. Hence why they should focus on the behavior and not how he's feeling about it.", "Lol if I forgot my bags I just buy whatever I can carry by hand. If I gotta go back to grocery store again that week maybe I\u2019ll remember.", "Same but I was already checking out so I told them no bags. They put everything in the cart, and I pushed the cart to the car and bagged it there. Punishing yourself helps.", "This is exactly how I made myself remember to bring them with me. That, and the shame of bagging everything in the parking lot. I'm glad I wasn't the only adult punishing myself like this hahaha.", "Oh my god, I never thought of putting them in the car! Haha thank you!", "I have a reminder on my phone that\u2019s set up for just this reason. It goes off when I\u2019m in the parking lot of the grocery store.", "If that\u2019s seriously your take, why isn\u2019t the root of the problem that she is huffy and annoyed about his refusal to keep being her delivery service? He \u201ccan\u2019t control how she feels about his behavior\u201d either\n\nThey\u2019re both annoyed, she\u2019s just the unreasonable/selfish one", "This is the stupidest opinion", "You are welcome!"]}
