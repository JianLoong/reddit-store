And watch your accounts.", "No, you're NTA. Tbh I think they were incredibly lucky to succeed once as these procedures are not that reliable. You could end up spending all your money and still there would be no baby.\n\nMuch as I sympathise with your partner's sister, this is not a life-threatening situation.", "NTA. You do NOT owe that to anyone. You may need to rethink your own relationship and get counseling if your partner is putting their sisters WANTS not needs. Over your own", "NTA - there is help and then there is crazy.  You are being asked to do crazy. First provide for your family then \u201chelp\u201d extended family as you want to.   I guess when the sister needs a new car for her growing family that is on you too \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "NTA\n\nI'd help my siblings if I could afford it so I understand your partner's feelings. However, I don't think I could ever ask my wife to make that sacrifice with me.\n\nThat said, you shouldn't force her to into paying into your plans either. You guys should sit down and rework your plans.", "NTA. They already got lucky enough to have a kid, and realistically they don\u2019t need the treatment. It sucks to be infertile and must be frustrating but it\u2019s your money to spend, and if they can\u2019t afford another child it\u2019s not your burden.", "NTA.  Sister has had two tries, if she wants a third they should take out a loan themselves.  You need your money for yourself and future family.", "NTA \n\nYou\u2019ve had to scrimp and save just to get 6000 in savings. Who knows how long it\u2019ll take next time? You\u2019ve got stuff to pay for and getting on the property ladder is getting more and more difficult.", "NTA. If you can't afford 10,000$ you can't afford another kid. And seeing as you're not the parent of the potential child, it's not even a little bit your responsibility to pay.", "NTA.", "So they knowingly took on a debt they know they couldn't pay, then expect you to help?\n\nNTA", "Nta! Her life is not your responsibility. She has been lucky to have one child, sounds like you don't have any yet so please save your money for your future children!", "NTA - that's your money, not theirs. If they want another baby, they'll just have to start saving..", "NTA. This is serious, I know she is your partner's sister, but spend everything you have in savings to give her, if it were a loan between people, knowing how things are going, your partner will say that she is from my family, I have to help etc.\r  \nBe careful because seeing things will begin to try to touch your feelings.", "NTA. You are totally right about this. Having a child is a WANT not a NEED.  Plus this is *not even your own problem* \\- it's someone else's!  You are NOT responsible for helping someone else with their \"wish\" list! That's just crazy, and irresponsible. Your partner is just too emotionally involved and wants to spend you into poverty just to help her sister with something that is not even a NEED -and it's not even *guaranteed to work!!*  Stand your ground, and guard your accounts.", "NTA\n\nChange the accounts so both of you need to sign.\n\nIt does worry me that she is happy to give up on your future togeather, by spending the money.\n\nMaybe its time to cut losses and give her the boot.", "NTA, and i would highly suggest that you either block the account so no money can be taken away from it or transfer the money you put in to another account till the issue is solved. If she just takes the money and give it away, there will be nothing you can do about it. If its a shared account or an account she can access then she is legaly allowed to take as much money out as she wants.", "NTA", "NTA.\n\nI can understand they would want a second child but that is their choice. You don't have to pay for their choice. Also, with a bit of bad luck it fails again.  \nAre the sister and her partner thinking of even repaying you for the money?  \n\n\nThe money you saved is also something for emergencies.\n\nKeep an eye on your accounts.", "NTA\n\nIf they can't afford the treatment, they probably can't afford the costs of raising another child. So guess who's going to be expected to help them? You, again.\nProtect the money that you both earned working hard to plan your own future and please don't feel guilty.", "NTA  if they want another child so desperately they can start saving their own money.

What if it doesn't work?  Will they ask again? Will they then decide to raise the money on their own?\n\nHelping people by giving money for a gamble shouldn't come at a cost to you and your family.

If you give them money and they don\u2019t pay it back, there will be more awkwardness and more tension in the family.", "NTA: situations like this is why my mom told me to never have a joint accounts and both people should have separate savings accounts and come together with that money when needed. I recommend calculating exactly what you've put into the account and withdrawing it and putting it into an account that's solely in your name. She can do whatever she wants with her money, but make sure yours is protected.", "NTA - you shouldn't be obligated to give up your dreams for others to follow theirs. Their dream is THEIR dream, they need to find a way to accomplish it without forcing other people to give everything up for them.", "NTA.

Also, should they be having more kids if they are scraping the bottom of the barrel paying for another round of IVF? Seems irresponsible.", "NTA. Like you say, you have your wants and needs too. Your hard earn money is yours to do what you want with.\n\nHeaven forbid if you decide to have kids later down the line and struggle fertility wise, are they going to step in and pay for your attempts?

Plenty of people have the ongoing income to support a kid but don\u2019t have the money for IVF upfront too. It\u2019s like saying you obviously can\u2019t afford to rent a place because you don\u2019t have the savings for a down payment to buy.", "Sad but a good idea or the money could disappear.", "That's not at all true. Children are expensive as shit, and someone demonstrating their inability to come up with $10,000 for an OPTIONAL procedure in order to have another one demonstrates they can't afford another one. \n\nRenting and buying a home is not a good metaphor here - you need a place to live, you don't need another child. Wanting something and needing it are not the same thing. And they WANT another child, they don't need one."]}
