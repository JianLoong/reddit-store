You do NOT owe that to anyone. You may need to rethink your own relationship and get counseling if your partner is putting their sisters WANTS not needs.

You guys should sit down and rework your plans.", "NTA. They already got lucky enough to have a kid, and realistically they don\u2019t need the treatment.

You\u2019ve got stuff to pay for and getting on the property ladder is getting more and more difficult.", "NTA. If you can't afford 10,000$ you can't afford another kid.

She has been lucky to have one child, sounds like you don't have any yet so please save your money for your future children!", "NTA - that's your money, not theirs. If they want another baby, they'll just have to start saving..", "NTA. This is serious, I know she is your partner's sister, but spend everything you have in savings to give her, if it were a loan between people, knowing how things are going, your partner will say that she is from my family, I have to help etc.\r  \nBe careful because seeing things will begin to try to touch your feelings.", "NTA. You are totally right about this. Having a child is a WANT not a NEED.  Plus this is *not even your own problem* \\- it's someone else's!  You are NOT responsible for helping someone else with their \"wish\" list! That's just crazy, and irresponsible. Your partner is just too emotionally involved and wants to spend you into poverty just to help her sister with something that is not even a NEED -and it's not even *guaranteed to work!!*  Stand your ground, and guard your accounts.", "NTA\n\nChange the accounts so both of you need to sign.\n\nIt does worry me that she is happy to give up on your future togeather, by spending the money.\n\nMaybe its time to cut losses and give her the boot.", "NTA, and i would highly suggest that you either block the account so no money can be taken away from it or transfer the money you put in to another account till the issue is solved. If she just takes the money and give it away, there will be nothing you can do about it. If its a shared account or an account she can access then she is legaly allowed to take as much money out as she wants.", "NTA", "NTA.\n\nI can understand they would want a second child but that is their choice.

I recommend calculating exactly what you've put into the account and withdrawing it and putting it into an account that's solely in your name. She can do whatever she wants with her money, but make sure yours is protected.", "NTA - you shouldn't be obligated to give up your dreams for others to follow theirs. Their dream is THEIR dream, they need to find a way to accomplish it without forcing other people to give everything up for them.", "NTA. But take half of the money and keep on your own savings account. I wouldn't trust her.", "If they can't afford to have another kid, then how will they afford to support it when it comes?

Also, should they be having more kids if they are scraping the bottom of the barrel paying for another round of IVF? Seems irresponsible.", "NTA. Like you say, you have your wants and needs too. Your hard earn money is yours to do what you want with.\n\nHeaven forbid if you decide to have kids later down the line and struggle fertility wise, are they going to step in and pay for your attempts?

Plenty of people have the ongoing income to support a kid but don\u2019t have the money for IVF upfront too. It\u2019s like saying you obviously can\u2019t afford to rent a place because you don\u2019t have the savings for a down payment to buy.", "Sad but a good idea or the money could disappear.", "That's not at all true. Children are expensive as shit, and someone demonstrating their inability to come up with $10,000 for an OPTIONAL procedure in order to have another one demonstrates they can't afford another one. \n\nRenting and buying a home is not a good metaphor here - you need a place to live, you don't need another child. Wanting something and needing it are not the same thing. And they WANT another child, they don't need one.", "Why should you bear the costs of SILs desire to have more children? How much more will you be asked for if you did relent and it fails? \n\nNTA", "NTA.  And this is your problem......how?", "NTA - they don't have money for the procedure but yet they want to have another child? They're nuts", "NTA. What happens a if you give it all and you have an emergency? She already has one kid. If she wants one more she should save for it. How is she going to afford the extra kid if she can\u2019t afford this? It\u2019s not your job to pay for it and you don\u2019t have to (unless you actually wanted to).", "NTA you should not give your savings away like that.", "NTA\n\nYou want children too. What if you want/need to get medical help with this?", "NTA", "NTA. Not your child to pay for. Keep your money safe!", "NTA if your partners sister can\u2019t afford to pony up 10,000 on her own that means she is well beyond her means and need to be thankful that she has one child and start saving her funds to get the procedure again..Your partner is a damn fool to sacrifice her future giving all that money away, what if this next procedure fails too then what? You two save money again and she will be back for that money too? Not to sound cold hearted but they have one child and unless they can save up to do it themselves and not be asking people for their life\u2019s savings being selfish for something that may not work.", "NTA and what happens if the second try fails? So your life and dreams are destroyed, and they still have a child. 1 child is more than enough they are lucky that the first try went well. Dose your partner really want the life you have been working towards? Weird to give up all your hopes and dreams when your sister already has a child. Juat saying.", "I also think I would feel more for the sister if they didn't have a 1yr old, as well. If both attempts failed, I would understand the longing and desperation. I do understand wanting another (hell, I've got 2 teens and a 4yo!) but she needs to pay herself or just be somewhat happy she was successful already. Some people aren't that lucky.", "NTA.  If they can\u2019t afford it, they don\u2019t get another one.  It really is that simple.  Your partner expecting to throw away your savings away is unreasonable.  You need to split your savings so your portion cannot be accessed.", "NTA, why would do it again if they don\u2019t have money for it and also why would you bring a child in this world if you can\u2019t afford it", "NTA.  DO NOT give the sister money.  When will it end?  What if the procedure doesn't work the next time?  Or the next 10 times?  Or a cousin expects help for the same thing? This is a very bad precedent to set.", "NTA.  The Sister's child problem belongs to the sister.  What if you hand over all your savings and it doesn't work again???  All that money right down the drain and for nothing.  It is selfish and wrong of them to ask you for your savings for their child problems.  They have a child - they should be grateful for what they have.", "NTa. That\u2019s money saved for your family and it could just be a waste of money as it didn\u2019t work last time. Are you supposed to save up another $10,000 for them again, I don\u2019t think so.", "Absolutely NTA, please double and triple check your money is secure.", "NTA\n\nAlso, if you give them $10,000 and it again doesn't work, that money is just gone. No baby, no money, nothing. That's frightening.\n\nI wish your wife would understand that the money you give to sister is money your wife's own children won't have.", "NTA When covid happened my husband was put on furlough and afterwards 25% of the workforce was let go. At that moment we realised we just didn't have enough savings to pay the mortgage, or the bills for more than a couple months. If we rented out the house and lived with relatives the rent wouldn't cover the mortgage. We put it on the market and downsized hugely. We now have savings, a plan for the future and no mortgage. We are here to catch our adult kids if they falter and fall in these hard times. What I am trying to say, is that you have to think of protecting yourselves first, building contingency plans if you lose your job, building for your future. Giving up your entire savings for someone else's expensive dreams is not on. They need to save the money for a child, not take everything you have.", "NTA if your SIL can\u2019t afford IVF, she can\u2019t afford another child. Do not put yourself at risk just to please somebody else. Your financial stability is more important then their desire to have another child that they can\u2019t afford.", "NTA. Might be time for joint and individual savings accounts. If your partner wants to give her savings to her sister, fine, but it shouldn't interfere with joint goals.\n\nYou also don't have any money! And if you are in your 30s, you don't know if you'll need the same procedure. It's unlikely that the sister will be able to pay the money back with two kids to support.", "This is the way\u2026", "I agree OP is absolutely NTA and should not be giving money. SIL needs to save or find another way to raise the money. \n\nI don\u2019t agree with your argument though - SIL may be able to afford another child, just doesn\u2019t have $10,000 to pay out in one lump sum, it\u2019s a hefty chunk of money.", "Actually, she can't. The cost of a child is $10,000. She doesn't have $10,000, therefore she can't afford a child. \n\nI want a house. A mortgage requires a 20% down payment, but in the long run won't cost that much. So I should be allowed to go to my relatives and demand a down payment, right? Because I'll be able to afford the house, I just haven't put in the effort to save the 20%. \n\nIt's the exact same situation. Upfront costs are part of the cost of something.", "It's happened too. There was a husband who posted about his wife donating $5000 for her work charity event out of their personal savings. She didn't even ask him if it was ok.", "NTA\n\nAnd make sure that money is in an account that she cannot access. If she's that susceptible to pressure from her sister, she might just take it.", "What happens when you give them all your money and it still doesn't work? Who else are they going to bleed dry? Get your $$ out of the accounts now before it vanishes. NTA.", "NTA- You dont have to give your money to fund someone else's life style.", "NTA.  Look, I get that they want a second.  But I know several people who needed anywhere from 3-6 cycles.  I think people think that once you go to IVF it\u2019s almost certain or maybe twice.  It\u2019s not.  It\u2019s really only something you can do if you have the money in hand.", "NTA - this is not on you or your partner. As someone who has gone through IVF I get the expense and I would never try to guilt trip someone into giving me money just because I didn\u2019t have it.", "NTA. SIL should just be grateful she was able to have one child.", "NTA at all. Laughs in American", "NTA \n\nIt sucks for them, but you\u2019re not responsible for making things happen for them. And what would happen if the next try failed? Would she expect you to take out a loan to help them?\n\nIf you want something and it costs something and you don\u2019t have the money for it you can of course ask people if they want to give you money, but they\u2019re in no way obligated to give you that money."]}
