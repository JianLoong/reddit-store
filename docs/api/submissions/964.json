My friends and I did nothing too fancy, just dressed as various NFL players (we are football teammates). Originally, I was planning on going with just my friends, but a few days before Halloween, my aunt (33F) asked me if I could take her son (10M) with me because her and my uncle (33M) would not be able to due to work related events (they run a business). \n\nI agreed to watch him if she agreed to pay me and my friends, which she didn\u2019t even argue with. I often babysit him and on a few occasions where I couldn\u2019t, my friends have. The only reason I do it is she pays much better than any job I can get at 14. My aunt and uncle also have another child, their daughter (8F), she was going out with a friend\u2019s parents that night. My cousin was going to go out with his friends, but after a bullying incident, my aunt and the other boys parents agreed it was better to have them \u201ctake a break\u201d from each other. Part of the reason my aunt and uncle pay so well is they can\u2019t find other babysitters easily, their daughter is generally ok, she can be a bit much at times, but that\u2019s normal for an 8 year old. Their son is a nightmare, he\u2019s mean, doesn\u2019t respect parents or teachers and is not a fun person to be around. My friends know all of this, they\u2019ve seen his behavior, but they also wanted extra money which is why we agreed to it. \n\nAfter school, my friends and I go and get my cousin from our grandma and grandpa\u2019s house. The neighborhood we live in is very suburban and mostly families with children, so many houses leave out bowls because their kids are busy trick or treating. My cousin decided to ignore all of the \u201ctake one\u201d signs and poured entire bowls of candy or taking handfuls of the candy he likes and leaving the \u201cbad stuff\u201d to others, we tried stopping him but he kept running ahead of us and we didn\u2019t want to have to chase him all night. \n\nWhen we got back to my grandparent\u2019s house, my friends and I decided to watch some ESPN in one of the guest rooms. My cousin went in the kitchen and started eating his candy. When my aunt finally came to pick him up, my friends and I were in the dining room eating dinner. I went up to her and started explaining what had happened and she said \u201cwell I\u2019ve told him not to be greedy\u201d and she said she\u2019d have a talk with him. She then went on about how parenting is hard and stuff like that. I started getting annoyed, I let her keep talking but then I got angry and told her that parenting being hard isn\u2019t an excuse for raising a \u201clittle prick\u201d. I told her that he was a prick and that if she doesn\u2019t stop him, he\u2019ll end up expelled once he starts middle school next school year. She left shortly after that but was clearly mad.\n\nYesterday, my mom asked to speak to me when I got up for school, she told me what I said was unacceptable, and I heard from other families agreeing. My friends think I did nothing wrong.
