I wasn\u2019t ready to be a parent, and instead put him up for an open adoption. The little family that adopted him would send me birthday and holiday cards and such, but that was as much as I was involved. I was terrified. The baby was diagnosed with some issue with the nerve in his eye and was blind from it. I felt like I did something wrong, or I had caused it. I also felt so relieved I got to move on and live my life, I went to college, I built a career, all the while feeling this immense relief when this family would write me to tell me about his first braille typewriter or whatnot that I wasn\u2019t having to deal with this\u2026 and then I\u2019ve always felt guilty for being relieved.\n\nI\u2019m now married, and I have two daughters (32F and 28F) with my husband. They have always known I had another child who was adopted. My daughters have also always been interested in fostering this connection. I\u2019ve always suggested we leave him alone to live his life. Without my knowing, my oldest sought him out on FaceBook of all places. Though her she has brought him in to be involved with the family the past few years. While they may have had an instant connection, I feel embarrassed to say I just haven\u2019t. I\u2019m happy to know that he\u2019s doing well in life, he\u2019s getting married this spring and he has a doctoral degree in physics. It\u2019s all very nice to be proud of but it\u2019s like learning about a stranger, I certainly don\u2019t feel like his mother. \n\nThis thanksgiving we hosted. All three of my children were present. My son follows a guide dog to get around, but often when he is over he takes off the harness and lets the dog play with the other family dogs. That day was much the same. I gave the dogs some scraps to eat and didn\u2019t think anything more of it. Several days later it turns out his dog was at the emergency vet hospital and had some issues with maybe its pancreas and also a possible bone trapped in its intestine. They decided to take the dog to surgery to search for it and have it removed. My daughter immediately asked if I had given the dogs anything and was furious with me over giving them some table scraps. She is adamant I caused this issue and I shouldn be offering to pay.\n\nI did reach out to my son to offer to pay. He said that was kind but he had it covered. I told him I didn\u2019t want him to worry financially because I know it can be hard for him to keep employment given his condition. All he said was he has pet health insurance so after deductible he only pays 10% and he has completely capable of paying for it. We left it at that. My daughter is still now refusing to bring her dogs to my home, calling me irresponsible. She is blaming me and feels I \u201cnever take responsibility\u201d for the \u201charm\u201d I cause, but I cannot pay if her refuses to take my money.", "created_utc": 1704254723, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18x9xy5/aita_if_i_58f_dont_pay_vet_bills_for_my_sons_42m/", "score": 224, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Not really anything else you can do about it.\n\nAs far as your daughter's assessment, it sounds like she has no idea how much it will cost, how much he makes, an how that balances out. In the same way as someone with few means might say \"no bid deal,\" when a friend/family member *technically* owes them a small amount of money; so too is that possible for higher costs weighed against a higher income. That's the prerogative your son exercised here. What's important here is that you made the offer sincerely and with every intent to follow up if it was accepted.\n\nHowever, the only reason the verdict is N T A and not N A H is because the reasoning behind your why your daughter won't bring her dogs over.  While it's unreasonable to expect you to pay something that's being refused, it's not unreasonable to expect you to do something to demonstrate that you are indeed taking responsibility for your error (e.g. committing to not give the dogs table scraps, getting a dog gate to keep them out of the kitchen/away from dining, asking the dogs' owner what you can do to make them feel safe). \n\nIf it was just a matter of you're daughter saying, \"look, a dog was harmed here. I don't want my dogs here so they're not coming unless you do something to deal with the problem.\" It'd be N A H all the way. The problem is she's associating financial compensation with responsibility, when that's not the only way of demonstrating that. \n\nWhat she's looking for here isn't really the literal money component, its some kind of act on your part that demonstrates you are taking responsibility. The problem is you tried the financial bit, and aren't doing anything else aside from it (or she isn't aware that you are); and that after you tried the financial bit, your daughter took the stance of, \"well she clearly doesn't give a toot since she's not doing anything,\" which is overly simplistic and not really useful to go off about unless she's got some ideas on alternatives, or is willing to give you space to figure out what else to do.\n\nSo do something about that. Chat with her about how you *want* to take responsibility, you want to make sure your children feel safe having their pets in your home; and ask what you can do to make that happen. The financial component isn't an option, so you've come up with x/y/z suggestions and would like to get her feed back and solicit some of hers. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\---------------------\n\nAs an aside, for anyone who doesn't have pet insurance and has a pet, please get it if possible. Seriously. I have a dog that has had to have a couple of surprise surgeries due to a habit of conflating whole socks with food, resulting in surgeries to remove them; not unlike the removal of the bone in the case of OP's son's dog. Trupanion made actually getting the pup the care he needed financially possible. Not only does it help alleviate that pain, in OP's case it did so to such a degree that a potentially relationship wrecking problem (with the son) due to financial strain was rendered no big deal.", "NTA.

I wasn\u2019t ready to be a parent, and instead put him up for an open adoption. The little family that adopted him would send me birthday and holiday cards and such, but that was as much as I was involved. I was terrified. The baby was diagnosed with some issue with the nerve in his eye and was blind from it. I felt like I did something wrong, or I had caused it. I also felt so relieved I got to move on and live my life, I went to college, I built a career, all the while feeling this immense relief when this family would write me to tell me about his first braille typewriter or whatnot that I wasn\u2019t having to deal with this\u2026 and then I\u2019ve always felt guilty for being relieved.\n\nI\u2019m now married, and I have two daughters (32F and 28F) with my husband. They have always known I had another child who was adopted. My daughters have also always been interested in fostering this connection. I\u2019ve always suggested we leave him alone to live his life. Without my knowing, my oldest sought him out on FaceBook of all places. Though her she has brought him in to be involved with the family the past few years. While they may have had an instant connection, I feel embarrassed to say I just haven\u2019t. I\u2019m happy to know that he\u2019s doing well in life, he\u2019s getting married this spring and he has a doctoral degree in physics. It\u2019s all very nice to be proud of but it\u2019s like learning about a stranger, I certainly don\u2019t feel like his mother. \n\nThis thanksgiving we hosted. All three of my children were present. My son follows a guide dog to get around, but often when he is over he takes off the harness and lets the dog play with the other family dogs. That day was much the same. I gave the dogs some scraps to eat and didn\u2019t think anything more of it. Several days later it turns out his dog was at the emergency vet hospital and had some issues with maybe its pancreas and also a possible bone trapped in its intestine. They decided to take the dog to surgery to search for it and have it removed. My daughter immediately asked if I had given the dogs anything and was furious with me over giving them some table scraps. She is adamant I caused this issue and I shouldn be offering to pay.\n\nI did reach out to my son to offer to pay. He said that was kind but he had it covered. I told him I didn\u2019t want him to worry financially because I know it can be hard for him to keep employment given his condition. All he said was he has pet health insurance so after deductible he only pays 10% and he has completely capable of paying for it. We left it at that. My daughter is still now refusing to bring her dogs to my home, calling me irresponsible. She is blaming me and feels I \u201cnever take responsibility\u201d for the \u201charm\u201d I cause, but I cannot pay if her refuses to take my money.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I have a lab who, as a puppy, ate a toy, his bed, and a magnet, respectively. I've gone through this with three emergency vets. Each one has always said that surgery was a last resort. If we caught it quickly, we tried to make him purge. If we didn't, we waited to see if it would pass naturally.
