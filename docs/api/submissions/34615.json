To celebrate the occasion, I wanted to do something a bit more special compared to all the previous birthdays, so I decided we would spend the day out (I asked in advance if she wanted to stay in or go out), have lunch, go wherever she wanted to go, and then go to the minigolf at 6pm where my sister and her boyfriend would join us and turn this in a mini surprise birthday party. Nothing crazy, just spending 1 hour together, then get some dessert and be home by about 9pm. \n\nBefore I booked, I asked her if she was fine being out and about from around 1pm, then going at X location for a chill activity at 6pm, and be home by 9pm. I kept it vague, but told her it was something I know she would\u2019ve liked because she mentioned going to the minigolf before (we\u2019ve been together 8 years btw). \n\nShe said ok, so I booked everything. That was on December 29. \n\nAll seemed ok. She seemed excited about the prospect of doing something. This morning I mentioned it again, and she was jokingly trying to find out were we were going. I didn\u2019t want to tell her, and she left it at that. \n\nSometime later, she asked me if I could cancel. I said not really because it was already paid and should\u2019ve cancel yesterday to get the money back. Then, thinking it would put her mind at ease, I told her where we were going, and that my sister and her boyfriend would join us. \n\nIt went downhill from there. \n\nShe said I ruined her birthday, that she couldn\u2019t do anything in the morning because of me (I was working from home until 12pm), that her nan couldn\u2019t visit (I told her she could and I would\u2019ve worked in the bedroom), that she already told her nan she couldn\u2019t visit because I was working so she couldn\u2019t backtrack now (I said she could\u2019ve said \u201cnevermind, OP said it\u2019s ok she will be in the other room). She said I booked it too far away, that it was too late (she\u2019s not working tomorrow), that I should\u2019ve booked it closer to home, that I wasn\u2019t thinking about her, and some more. \n\nI ended up cancelling saying that my partner was ill so today was cancelled. \n\nSome time late I go in the bedroom where she is crying to apologise. It was not my intention to hurt her, i was trying to do something nice and it backfired. I asked if she wanted to still go out and have a meal together, wherever she wanted. \n\nI tried to hug her and she shrugged me off, saying that she is too hurt by this, that her day is forever ruined, she said \u201chow do we come back from this?\u201d, and that she will not accept my apology, that she won\u2019t be submissive. \n\nAt that point I got annoyed again because yes, I made a mistake, but it was not done with the intention to cause harm, and I think it\u2019s unfair to be treated like I did some unspeakable thing instead of a poorly planned birthday. \n\nSo, AITA?", "created_utc": 1704729256, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/191ob6a/aita_for_planning_the_wrong_birthday_activity_for/", "score": 17, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

This is super weird. I don't see what you even did that got her upset? Is there something else going on, or does she always act like this?", "NTA, and she's being overly dramatic by stating \"how do we come back from this\".", "I think NTA, though ig going forward don\u2019t do surprises?\n\nI don\u2019t think you did anything wrong here. You asked well in advance for approval on the times, more than once, before booking. Then she asks to cancel gor a very random laundry list of reasons the day of?", "NTA with this info\u2026\nMaybe she\u2019s having a midlife crisis and nothing would have been good enough?\n\nWould your brother and his gf be who she wants to hang out with on her bday? Maybe she would have rather had her friends/family? That\u2019s the only thing I can think of, otherwise it sounds like a nice day \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nThe nan thing sounds like shes reaching for excuses for the day to be ruined. Maybe her friends husband just took her on a caribbean cruise for 40 and shes jealous/self-pitying", "NTA: this gave me the ick. You planned a day of activities which she agreed to the timeframe of and now you\u2019ve ruined her bday. Yeah this screams \u201cI\u2019m picking a fight on purpose\u201d", "NTA. \"she said \u201chow do we come back from this?\u201d\" <-- she can decide what happens for her 50th?", "There seems to be something else going on here. Based on the post, NTA. But something is going on with your girlfriend", "NTA at all, these all seem like perfectly nice, normal birthday plans.", "NTA\n\nYou did nothing wrong. Stop apologising, she needs to apologise to you for being an ungrateful miserable B\\*\\*\\*\\*.\n\nYou organised a really nice day out for her and she threw it back in your face for no apparent reason.\n\nStop apologising to your ungrateful excuse of a wife!\n\nShe should be sleeping on the couch or in the spare room for the foreseeable!", "\u201eShe\u2019s gone, alone\u201c\u2026are you sure?", "NTA - This is weird behaviour, and sounds like there's something else going on.", "NTA - if she makes an excuse to go somewhere tonight to at any point today, she is cheating, and wants to spend her time with them therefore needed to start a fight! I really hope it\u2019s not, but I can\u2019t make sense of the whole thing, it\u2019s weird, you did nothing wrong at all", "NTA. You planned the day around things you genuinely thought she would enjoy. It would finish reasonably early AND she would be off work the following day, in any case. There is not a single, reasonable excuse for her tantrum.", "NTA this is a very weird reaction for a surprise party. She's had plenty of time to make arrangement but chose to say anything about it a day before?", "NTA. I\u2019m sorry to say this, but her behaviour feels like that of someone who already has one foot out the door and is manufacturing drama so they can justify leaving.", "INFO: did you ask her what you should have done instead? Was she expecting something romantic, or a lot more special than mini-golf? Because, to be honest, mini-golf just sounds like a regular date.\n\nMini-golf and dessert after: I used to have that exact date all the time when I was 15.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

But you did have her thinking it was going to be the two of you doing something on her birthday. You make a plan that includes your sister and her boyfriend, does your partner have any issues with these people? It may have gone better to invite one of her friends or family members.", "She said she\u2019s been stressed the past couple of months (moving house) and that I made her even more stressed. She said I was only thinking about myself when I organised this, not her, and I should\u2019ve known better. \n\nLike I said, I thought that double checking before booking anything meant that she was ok with this. But apparently not.", "That and the \"I won't be submissive\" comment. \nGoing by the events in the post. I don't see anywhere where she was asked or demanded to be so? \nShe was asked so the day could be planned according to her wants. \nNan could fine come over. But she was dramatic.\n\nAnd reading other comments from OP, she left the house to go to the store because it was too depressing to be at home.", "Definitely last time doing this. \n\nI honestly thought she was ok with this because I asked in advanced if she wanted to stay in or go out, once she said she wanted to go out I asked if she was ok if we did something in the day and then go somewhere else, stating location and time. \n\nThe only secret was the activity in itself and the fact that 2 more people would join in the last 2-is hours of the day. \n\nBut now she keeps telling me how she will never forget this, never forgive me, how I ruined everything, and that I don\u2019t care about her at all. Even trying to put this aside and do something different is met with scorn, and now she\u2019s gone to the shop, alone, saying she won\u2019t stay in the house any longer because it\u2019s depressing. \n\nSeriously at loss here.", "She have never spent any birthday with friends or family in these past 8 years, and never expressed any desire to do so in the past, as they\u2019re not exactly close. \n\nShe was upset about her nan not coming over today but tomorrow, but when I said she could come (which I did while she was on the phone with her) she said it was too late now. \n\nShe did mentioned a couple of people asking her what she was doing on her birthday, to which she replies I had planned something for her, and she seemed happy. \n\nShe asked me to cancel before she even knew two more people would join, and then again, that was only at the very end of it. \n\nHer main reasons were the place was too far away and it was late in the evening.", "What I can say is that she\u2019s had a very rough year, and I wanted to do something chill but nice for her. \n\nI know she doesn\u2019t like staying out late, especially if she works the following day, but she\u2019s off for the next two weeks and since I had asked in advance I thought it was fine for me to proceed. \n\nWe had a few arguments in the past days, but all was fine this morning up until she asked me if I could cancel. The rest of how that went is in the post. \n\nIf she has any other reasons apart from that, I am not sure. I know she\u2019s been feeling down, but I wouldn\u2019t have done any of this if I had thought she would\u2019ve reacted this way.", "I\u2019m fairly certain she did. She was not gone for long, asked me if I needed something, then came back with some shopping. \n\nNot entirely sure why she reacted the way she did, but I don\u2019t think it was so she could spend time with someone else.", "Not exactly. \n\nI asked her if she wanted to go out or stay in, to which she replied \u201cdefinitely going out\u201d. \n\nThen I asked if she had something in mind, and she said, \u201cno not really\u201d she just wanted to go out. \n\nI asked her if she was ok with my planning something small, I was thinking a meal together, then go to her favourites book shops, and do whatever else she wanted, then if she was ok with me booking something at 6pm, told her it would last until about 7pm, then we would have dessert and then come home. \n\nShe said yes to all of this. \n\nShe\u2019s not the fancy type, she doesn\u2019t drink, doesn\u2019t dress up, doesn\u2019t really fancy high end restaurants. She likes small quiet things and activities, not too crowded or loud. Our first date was in a museum then coffee shop, I thought that was ok. \n\nHer reasoning was that the place was too far away, that I should\u2019ve booked it sooner and earlier in the day.", "You didn't do anything wrong. She's just wanting to lash out, and you're a safe target.", "Don't forget the bit about her day is forever ruined. \ud83d\ude44 Talk about a drama queen...", "Yikes. That reaction is crazy. You didn\u2019t do anything wrong. Maybe she\u2019s just stressed or projecting.", "Something else is going on with her if she feels she cannot forgive you for planning a day that didn\u2019t meet her expectations. OP, have there been other troubles in the relationship lately apart from the stress with the move?\n\nNTA. Not even a little bit", "Change gears. You can discuss and thrash this out later. Plan a good day in for her. Invite her nan as a surprise, cook her favourite meals, gift her a spa day if she\u2019s into that."]}
