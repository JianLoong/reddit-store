We're close, have known each other for a few years, and generally the vibe is really good with very few arguments or disagreements.\n\nHowever, we had an incident this past weekend where I have been made to feel like the villain, and I genuinely don't think i am. One of my housemates called Max has a sister who has 2 kids, a girl who's around 4/5 and a boy who is i guess between 18months - 2 years. Normally I love kids, and have a lot of patience with them, but these two just fry my brain. They scream, they pick stuff up and throw it on the ground, they jump up and down on the sofas, they chase the dog. Lot's of stuff that normal kids do, however I just think if I had kids (which I don't), but if i was taking them to someone elses house, i absolutely wouldn't let up jump up and down on the furniture or chase a dog that isn't used to them. \n\nAnyway, normally when I know they are coming I put the dog into a different room and remove anything that's breakable. \n\nSo this past weekend they came round, and my other housemates were out, only Max and myself were in. Now i was incredibly hung over, and had even less patience for these kids than the usual microscopic amount I usually have. But the usual happened where they were SO loud and jumping on the furniture and not treating our place with respect. Their mom just sat there with a glass of wine without a care in the world. My head was thumping. AND THEN despite me asking them to stay out of the kitchen where the dog was, the 4/5 year old ran over to the kitchen, opened the door and proceeded to run towards the dog whilst literally screaming.\n\nGenuinely my main concern was that I didn't want the dog to do anything stupid, so I jumped to my feet, ran into the kitchen, and shouted at this girl to sit down, to be quiet and to stop jumping about. It came out to her with a pretty harsh tone, but I was just so fed up with the constant noice and mahem every time they visit. But then she started crying, which then made the younger child cry, which then made the mother literally scream at me saying i had no right to speak to her children that way. She then went on to say that I was rude, always negative around her kids, and that she wouldn't be bringing them to the house in the future if i was there (pretty good result really haha)\n\nBut jokes aside it then made me housemate pissed with me, and neither him or his sister seem to understand it from my pov. So just curious as to whether AITA or not?", "created_utc": 1683121728, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/136l23z/aita_for_yelling_at_my_housemates_niece_and/", "score": 147, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

But I also agree that when you take your children to someone else\u2019s house you should do your absolute best to make sure they are at least someway civilized.\n\nAnd the dog thing gets me the most. You can bet your ass if your dog had bit the kid that mom would\u2019ve blamed you or the dog rather than her own child.

V would ask everyone if it was okay--even if it was during a time we were all out of the house--and also made sure her niblings knew 1. the closed doors meant those rooms were off limits, 2.

Sure the children should be able to have fun.  And it sounds like the hangover contributed to this a little.  But it was an issue that was building and was going to erupt sooner or later anyway.  Jumping on furniture is never acceptable at someone else's home.  Chasing at dogs is never acceptable, even if the dogs are friendly (note - there is a difference between runing around and playing chase ***with*** a happy dog vs simply chasing at a dog)  These are the children that end up entitled because no one is allowed to say no to them.
