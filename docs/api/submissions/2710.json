This is the perfect time to tell him that you have officially resigned as his social secretary and you expect him to put dates on his calendar because you are done reminding him of events he has agreed to attend.

It takes less than a minute, and it's kind of required to be considered a functioning adult.

He's a f*cking grown ass Man. Also ask him why is he relying on you to do this?. If he cannot answer I have assumptions why he do so.\n\nIn my opinion he's training you to do this thing for him because!\n\n1. he wanted you as his future Girlfriend or a Wife?. \n\n2. He's just plain lazy and was taking advantage of your kindness.\n\nBoth reasons are just plain disgusting. Imagine he, as a grown ass man cannot organize his own plans?.

If you believe he is worth it, ask to see his phone sometime before the end of each event, and put a reminder in his calendar for the next one.  Make things as easy on yourself as you can! Plan out the year in advance, skipping known obstacles (you go on a gal pal retreat for Labor Day) etc.  He has no excuses, and if he still tends to miss, you might want to drop this friend.\nI hope it all works out for you!", "Fuck that.

In order for your friend to change and learn, you had to be the AH at some point. In that respect you are NTA.

Restaurant dinners, dinners at home, days out, weddings, christenings, funerals, you name it.\n\nThe problem was, everyone indulged her and she always had some crap story as to why she had been late. Nevertheless, everyone else had to stand around with their thumbs up their behinds waiting for madam to grace us with her presence. Until...\n\nAfter far too many years, one day I just said to my wife and her mum that I was not going to be late for another dinner, they were welcome to stay and wait or come with me and that my sister-in-law knew where we were going. We all left, she had to drive to join us and we got an earful. However, after dong this five or six times, she finally realised that her princess days were over and her punctuality miraculously improved.\n\nYour friend is no different. All the time you indulge him, he has no need to organise himself and behave like an adult. Do this a few more times and he will soon learn to make a note to remind himself and you can begin to relax a bit.\n\nNTA but don't cave. He's thirty, not thirteen.\n\nEdit:  Spelling", "He's gonna be pissed the first few times he doesn't remember. \nOnce he gets used to your new normal, you'll be fine.", "Seems too coincidental that he messaged the next day. He knew when the event was and chose to not be there.

You're not his mother. Cut ties and leave.", "NTA.

He needs to take responsibility. He should be mad at himself not you.", "Is this really where we're at in life right now?\n\nIs it annoying? Yes. But How hard is it to just send a reminder, text? \n\nAs a professional who has to always be \"on it\" and \"on top of things\" at work,  sometimes personal things slip by me. \n\nThat type of work can be absolutely mentally draining and it can lend a hand to being a bit forgetful of things outside of work. \n\nIs this really a hill to die on? You're prepared to lose a friendship with someone simply because you think they should remember something?\n\nVery weird, if you ask me. How much does it actually hurt you to have to remind him?\n\nHe's forgetful and you're dramatic", "He also needs a diary", "Yes, he could, however, he obviously hasn\u2019t even though she has repeatedly told him that his inaction hurts her.

The only AH here is your friend for expecting you to remind him all the time.", "Today's favour is tomorrow's obligation.

I have time management issues so i put quick reminders in for everything.", "You're NTA.  You're also not his mommy or his secretary.  \n\nAsk him to explain to you why the burden of helping a capable adult professional remember social commitments should fall to you.  I don't even do this for my husband.", "NTA. \n\n\nHe\u2019s a project manager, which means he has to use calendars with alerts all the time for work. The fact that he doesn\u2019t do so with plans with you should tell you how much he actually values spending time with you. \n\nI have a similar friend, who both forgets when things are happening, and is perennially late; they also have special dietary restrictions, which means having dishes made just for them at dinner parties and barbecues.  After fussing about it for *way* too long I just decided that I would send one reminder, a reasonable amount of time ahead, be prepped as if they are showing up just in case, but not surprised if they don\u2019t (or show up hours late). \n\nMaybe your friend will learn, but I doubt it. Stop being his social secretary and live your life.", "NTA... this is how you do it. \"If it was important to you, you would have been there\"\n\nThere are so many ways to put a reminder on your phone or computer.", "NTA.

And a PM. Doesn't he know that smart phones have calendars? Where he can add events? Hell yes, you are his friend, not his personal assistant.
