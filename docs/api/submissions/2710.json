You are not his parent.", "NTA. It\u2019s not your job to remind your friend about important dates and events. I am neurodivergent and I immediately put everything on my calendar as it comes up, and set reminders so I know when and where I\u2019m supposed to be. I bet he could remember if he truly deemed it important.", "NTA. We literally have calendars in our phones now, he has no excuse to not write an event down.", "NTA.

You told him and reminded him once. He\u2019s an adult, so this is his problem, not yours.", "NTA. You're not his secretary.", "NTA (except maybe for playing along till now).

When he decides to talk to you,  tell him the truth and let him know he it makes you feel.  I suffer from severe memory problems and I'm always asking people when something is,  but I'm always asking and verifying and stubble checking because it's important to me.  When it becomes important to him,  he will get his shit together and set a reminder for himself.", "NTA. You made your poiny.

This is the perfect time to tell him that you have officially resigned as his social secretary and you expect him to put dates on his calendar because you are done reminding him of events he has agreed to attend. He's not so busy that he can't remember meet ups he's been enabled by you for so long that he figures you'll continue to remind him. You can still do that but I would suggest you get paid for it.", "NTA. He's an adult who organizes people's time for a living. Even if he didn't, he can't put in a calendar reminder for himself? It takes less than a minute, and it's kind of required to be considered a functioning adult. Shit, he can just yell at his phone or whatever to put a reminder in, he doesn't even need to open the calendar app. \n\nFuck that and fuck him, dude.", "NTA. \n\nI don't know why you don't realize he's literally making you his personal calendar, alarm clock and event organizer but this instance surely made you finally fed up right?.\n\nIf he still insists to be Mad at you please read aloud the replies to this post and say we all find him a loser for needing another person to organize plans for him. He's a f*cking grown ass Man. Also ask him why is he relying on you to do this?. If he cannot answer I have assumptions why he do so.\n\nIn my opinion he's training you to do this thing for him because!\n\n1. he wanted you as his future Girlfriend or a Wife?. \n\n2. He's just plain lazy and was taking advantage of your kindness.\n\nBoth reasons are just plain disgusting. Imagine he, as a grown ass man cannot organize his own plans?.

I've had many friendships like this and I'm to the point I've stopped being the one to make plans or remind people and basically haven't talked to any of them since.

Even if he were neurodiverse, just assuming that you are responsible for his schedule would be beyond rude.", "NTA \n\nYou need to sit down and think about if this friendship is really worth the hurt. If you believe he is worth it, ask to see his phone sometime before the end of each event, and put a reminder in his calendar for the next one.  Make things as easy on yourself as you can! Plan out the year in advance, skipping known obstacles (you go on a gal pal retreat for Labor Day) etc.  He has no excuses, and if he still tends to miss, you might want to drop this friend.\nI hope it all works out for you!", "Fuck that. He can put reminders in his own damn phone.", "Or maybe he could ask his mommy to do it for him because it's SO hard.", "I originally had a line about her being in the role of wifey/mommy but took it out.
