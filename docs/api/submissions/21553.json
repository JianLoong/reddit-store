Pretty clear", "Being bestman is not only an honor it's also an obligation with duties.\n\nAttending, bachelor party, gifts, Dresscode.etc.\n\nWhile you should take this for granted, having a friend you can ask as bestman shouldn't be taken for granted.\nSo OP having this stipulation is completely fine.\nLike say if OP had kids and they weren't invited, that would be equally legitimate grounds to decline being bestman.\nAnd you don't even need a reason to decline", "He admits no other groomsmen had their gf invited either. He just thinks he is special, Orr has a petulant girlfriend who was nagging the shit out of him", "Sorry FMIL you can\u2019t come groomsman anus has to have his GF there.", "Also in a comment the OP said the other groomsmen girlfriends were also not invited", "Plus he'll be busy being groomsman and she'll be making chit chat with aunty.", "I disagree - yes he is free to invite who he likes but OP is kinda obligated to attend. This isn\u2019t a backyard bbq it his wedding and he has asked OP to be a groomsman - you need a better reason than my gf is butt-hurt because she can\u2019t come too.", "How does that not make OP TA then? \n\nIt seems like insane entitlement to me to demand the couple to alter their guest list and pay for his gf to attend this wedding just because he\u2019s in it.", ">Most people know that it's a major faux pas to not invite the SO of someone in your wedding party\n\n\nMost people, yeah. \n\nExcept this couple isn't inviting anyone else's partner because that is the wedding they can afford. \n\nIs Op and his gf joined at the hip that he cannot do this for his friend on his friend's day? \n\nWhat kind of selfishness is this about being \"singled out and personal blow\" When the same rule applies to everyone else? \n\nOp has serious main character syndrome and for the sake of his friend, I hope he cuts out this AH from his life. \n\nSo his gf gets to go and others feel some type of way cos Op and his gf are so special? \n\nAnd don't come at me with that he gets to say but Op gets to do what he wants. It literally isn't about Op!

Given none of the groomsmen's girlfriends were invited, you weren't singled out but you make it sound in your OP that you were. You have every right to decline, of course, but since this is a blanket ban, you aren't being singled out, and you aren't entitled to special treatment. Given that is the case... I'm going to go and say that YTA.", "Then why do you feel \"singled out?\" If not everyones gf got an invite, then it sounds like he meant it when he said they were keeping it small. It has nothing to do with you.\n\nAgain, you are NTA, but neither is your friend. There is no set wedding guest rules. Couples can invite or not invite who they want. Just because you dont like it, doesnt make it wrong.\n\nJust as accepting an invitation is not mandatory. You can participate if you want, but you absolutely have every right not to.\n\nI shared my personal opinion on the matter already- but once tempers cool off, I would encourage you to consider discussing attendance as just a guest with your friend and gf. She is clearly important to you, but so is your friend. Maybe going for just the ceremony can be a compromise between everyones feelings.", "I was with you til this. YTA why do you get special treatment. You feel singled out by being treated the same as all the other groomsmen", "So what makes your Gf so special? That she just has to have an invite", "YTA\n\n>He explained that they were trying to keep the guest list small and\r  \nlimited to close family and a few friends.\n\nThat's it? That's the 'wrong thing' that your friend is prioritising over your feelings? It sounds completely reasonable. Grow up. You expect special treatment over the other groomsmen, which you are not entitled to. \n\nMake no mistake, you are not acting reasonably and if the friendship ends it will be your own fault entirely.", "We can all agree dudes an asshole just by the insane way he types. It\u2019s on brand with people who capitalize every word of a sentence LOL", "No, but he should expect the friendship to end and for him to be labelled the asshole and cause of it ending.", "Yeah but he is acting singled out when no other groomsmen\u2019s GFs were invited either.", "Just because no groomsmen get a +1 doesn't mean you have to be okay with that and attend the wedding.", "You arent obligated to attend any wedding.

It's their own decision.", "You're judging him on how he feels, not on his actions. \nWe don't know the details about the argument between him and his friend. \nHis choice to not attend the wedding is the judgment choice and it's a free will choice.

Definitely a teenager seeking attention.", "What actions are being justified? \nNot going to the wedding isn't him \"punishing\" his friend in any way. \nHe's invited to a wedding and his gf isn't. \nHe decides to not go because of it. \nSorry you don't have a solid relationship with your S.O. \nIf these kind of choices are what represent your upbringing then you have a lot of learning in life to do bud.", "Which is completely fine.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHe is a person,no ta dressed monkey to be commanded when and hwere to parade around.", "Ah didn't see the not.

But he did want to and then turned it around as some sort of offence that his girlfriend can\u2019t be included. I think OP has the right to ask if she can come but if he pulls out of being a groomsman then the friendship is done - a good friendship will outlast this marriage and the non-vite girlfriend. Not calling him the AH but he does need to put on his big boy pants and stop posting to Reddit to show his girlfriend how much he loves her.", "There is a general expectation that you attend a wedding for a close friend. You should *want* to celebrate their relationship with them, so it\u2019s not obligatory, but there is an expectation. A virtuous person would also respect the invite in and of itself, regardless of whether or not they attend. \n\nOP is using his own perceived slight (that the groom even made clear was not genuine or real)  to justify not wanting to celebrate his friends moment. He also is disrespecting the friendship that the groom is validating by inviting him to be in the freaking wedding. That\u2019s a meaningful gesture that OP is completely disregarding. \n\nThis would be fine if he had a good justification for doing so but it would also need to be a good justification for why they\u2019re not friends at all or shouldn\u2019t be. His justification ain\u2019t that. It\u2019s entitled, unreasonable, and narcissistic. He has no right to tell someone else how to do their own wedding.", "OP is TA he said in a comment no other groomsmen had their gf invited.

(For purposes of this argument just assume money and time off aren\u2019t the issue). OP COULD travel, but simply doesn\u2019t want to. He\u2019d rather not attend. If he backed out now, would you still feel like he owed it to his friend because it\u2019s what his friend wants and he originally agreed? \n\nI 100% agree couples are entitled to whatever they want on their wedding. But everyone needs to understand sometimes what you want isn\u2019t going to appeal to everyone and the result is they don\u2019t attend.", ">There is a general expectation that you attend a wedding for a close friend.\n\nOn the other hand it is also expected that long term couples be invited together to events especially if one person is in the wedding party.
