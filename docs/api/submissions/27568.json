You and bro clearly don't like the sister as much as you like each other and it's probably super noticeable.", "NTA. It appears as though your sister really needs some help.", "NTA but sis sounds like she has to work on herself and spend time with herself before coming around anyone. Poor thing needs to open up more and be more forgiving. Sounds like she just wants to be involved and loved by her family like anyone else. If there was some way she could understand that she needs to work on herself?", "NTA. It sounds like she's already going through some sort of mental breakdown if she's isolating herself and being destructive. She definitely needs to focus on herself and mental well-being, without trying to worry about what you two do or talk about when hanging out.\nYou can lose yourself if you're only focused on everyone else.", "NTA\n\nYour sister sounds unreasonably jealous and she should use her energy to improve her relationship with her brother instead of destroying yours.", "nta, your step sister needs help", "NTA. Would it be nice for you all to do something together? Sure and I hope you all do. However, she can\u2019t hold you or your brother hostage just for her needs. I hope your sister can talk to a therapist or something soon.", "Not what I was expecting, I could hear bangos when I was read the headline.", "NTA.", "NTA\n\nYour half-sister needs mental health help.

NTA for hanging with your brother, but something's definitely up with your sister... this isn't normal, (though maybe the family thinks it is normal for her?), and she's probably not getting the help she needs as a result...\n\nINFO: Is she in therapy?

At least that\u2019s what I would do :(", "Well that's really, really bad. You can't just leave safely with mold. How old was your sister when your family member died and was she close to them?", "I mean, your brother could be kinder towards her... but that's easy for us to say, without the whole story or having grown up with her...\n\nDunno, maybe suggest some hangouts with the three of you..."]}
