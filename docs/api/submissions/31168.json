For context: My mom died when I was 8. My parents were separated though not  divorced yet. My dad was already dating Sandra. Sandra's daughter aka my stepsister is Paige. So after my mom died dad was like we should all move in together and it would be good for me to be surrounded by family and to have that motherly figure right there. Sandra was eager to take on the role of a mother to me and for us to be close. I didn't hate her but my new mother she was not and that first year of us living together I yelled at her a bunch. First time was when she backed into a photo of my mom and the frame broke. I yelled so loud our neighbors heard and I made her leave my room. The second time she started telling me how mom had sent her to be with me and I lost it again. It happened a few more times too.\n\nPaige witnessed it all. She told me that we were going to be a family now and I should be glad to have such a good mom now. I told her I already had a good mom and my dad had to separate us because we both got loud. I was mad that Paige, being a dumb kid who didn't think things through, implied that my mom wasn't good. She took offense to me not wanting her mom to be my mom.\n\nNow we're all adults and I'm not in touch with any of them a ton. We're not really close. I see them infrequently. But I am engaged and while I was in town for my aunt's birthday (dad's sister) Sandra offered me her necklace that she wore on her and my dad's wedding day. I told her it was sweet but I already had a necklace I was wearing. She asked me if it was my mom's and I asked her why it mattered. She said I could represent both my mom's. I said again nice offer but I didn't want to.\n\nThis is where Paige comes in. Sandra told her about the necklace, the fact I was wearing my mom's necklace and turned down hers. Paige showed up at my aunt's house and asked me why the hell I was being such a petty child. She said \"our mom\" offered me the necklace because she wanted to do something kind and show me that she loves me. I told her I already had a necklace. She said wearing my mom's necklace to spite \"our mom\" was not something to be proud of. She was like look, I get it, I was getting a new parent too, but I didn't see her refusing to call dad \"dad\" or refusing to let him be her parent and dad. She said he was the best dad and she wouldn't reject him and her mom is the best and I shouldn't reject her. This is when I got mad because the comparison is unfair since Paige never had a dad in her life. And I told her not to compare us until her parent dies and then she can say she gets it.\n\nPaige told me that was an awful thing to say and how could I be so evil to wish that on her. She told Sandra and my dad and they were angry at me for telling her that. They said it was spiteful. My dad told me our circumstances were not that difference since we were the same age.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1700247950, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17xmehg/aita_for_telling_my_stepsister_she_can_compare_us/", "score": 1891, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

What you said to Paige is not akin to WISHING her mother or someone else would die, it's simply pointing out her comparison was unfair and dismissive. \n\nThey have severe victim mentalities, the both of them. For Sandra's part, the obvious answer would be to offer something different for you to wear at your wedding, showing some flexibility if all she wants is to be represented along with your mom, since you already have a necklace chosen. But instead she used this scenario - AGAIN - to pit herself against your mother and make you feel bad for having the audacity to remember, honor, and love your mother. It sounds like it is for the best that you don't see much of them. It doesn't sound like there is much opportunity for you to have loving relationships with them now that you're all adults because, well they're still evidently children.", "NTA\nAlthough your words were spoken out of anger, you did NOT wish anything bad on her. You were still grieving your mother's death when Paige tried forcing you to accept Sandra as your mother and continued to do so even when you didn't want to. And a necklace isn't that big of a deal. You wanted to have a piece of your mother with you at your wedding. The fact the Paige and Sandra got mad for something that could be easily fixed by just deciding on a different accessory just shows how petty they are.", "\"My dad told me our circumstances were not that difference since we were the same age.\"\n\nExcuse me? Ex-CU-se-me? I don't even have the words... \n\nYour situation is COMPLETELY different to Paige's, the only similarity is that you both gained a stepparent, YOU are the ONLY one who LOST a parent, what you said is just the plain truth, until one of hers dies there is no comparison.\n\nSandra is not, and has never been your mom, you never accepted her audition into the role, as much as she likes to pretend you did, so you are not obligated to wear her necklace to \"represent her\" as such.\n\nYour father handled this entire situation terribly, it doesn't seem like he took your feelings into consideration at all, at any point, instead he bulldozed his will and expected you to get over it, even now. \n\nAsk daddy-dearest to put himself in your shoes for even a second, ask him to imagine: your parents separate (not yet divorced), your father starts dating while still married to your mom, your mom dies, you are immediately shuffled into a house with strangers and expected to play happy family, your \"new mom\" tries to force a relationship, your dad tries to force the relationship between you and \"mom\", you don't get the time nor the support to grieve ANY of the aforementioned events, but are expected to just sit through it and smile, not cause waves. \n\nNTA.", "I am so sorry you are dealing with people who are so dismissive of your Mom.  \n\nAs a Mom with bonus kids, I never demanded or expected them to *ever* call me Mom.  I am another parent to support them and be a resource, however I am needed.  They are good kids and I am pleased that they consider me a friend and, am always surprised when they remember me on Mother's Day.\n\nThat your stepMom, stepsister, and Dad kept trying to force that Mom title onto you for Dad's new wife is unreasonable.  \n\nNTA.\n\nThey all need to step back and stop trying to get you to pretend your Mom never existed.  A real parent, one who loves you, would be more concerned with supporting and helping you than planting a flag on themselves with a title.  Why can't they just be family without disrespectfully denying that your Mom ever existed.\n\nI am sorry you lost her.", "NTA.\n\nLosing a parent and never having a parent are two completely different things. Not to mention, she was gaining a parental role while your dad was trying to replace one you already had. Trying to force a relationship on a child is never a good idea and resentment is generally what ends up happening. Case in point. \n\nAlso, you are under no obligation to accept anything from anyone. She offered, you politely declined. It's not your fault she can't take rejection. It also isn't your fault that your sister can't seem to understand that you said no, you mean no, and the only reason you said what you said is because *she* was unwilling to drop the subject. The only people to blame for your mother and sister's hurt feelings are themselves.", "NTA.  How you perceive interpersonal relationships is a singularly personal choice.  The beliefs, judgements, and complaints of others have no bearing on this decision.  Too bad that your frustration led to a combative statement.  Sometimes when we are talking we are losing.  Best to let Paige and anyone else who thinks that they know what is best for you, fade away.", "first of all, i'm sorry for your loss. even if it's been years, i'm sure it still hurts.\n\ni can see where your stepsister is coming from. she probably wanted a sister and was hopeful she could have that relationship with you. and i'm sure your stepmom cares for you a lot too. \n\nit seems like they WANT to be there for you, but don't know how. i think that pressure has just been pushing you away. and it makes sense. you don't want your stepmom to just replace your mom. it isn't fair to you at all.. and it doesn't seem like they're taking that into consideration.\n\nwhy was she so hellbent on giving the necklace to you? did she know you already had one from your mom before then?\n\nif she DID, that's really cruddy of her. it's as if she wanted to see if a part of you viewed her as a mother figure. \n\nbut either way, it's your wedding day, so you can wear whatever you want (i'm assuming that's what she offered it for?). \n\nsome people take \"no\" too personally. she offered, you refused because you already had something. and it's something that YOU hold emotional value towards. \n\nif you really wanted, you could ask her for some other type of jewelry. but that would be just to appease her at this point. \n\nNTA.", "NTA for sure. Sorry for your loss at such a young age. How you related the events that happened it seems to me that your father didn\u2019t give you enough time to grieve your loss. Shame on him for being selfish. Seems like stepmother/sister was imposed on you too soon. When you were having difficulties accepting them in the beginning, did your father even have the sensitivity to try to help you grieve and to understand why you were have difficulty accepting stepmom, maybe a couple of therapy sessions, even with him participating so that he could understand your feelings about your loss?

I\u2019m sorry you didn\u2019t get any space to mourn your mother. NTA.", "NTA.  Your dad was already dating your stepmom when your mom died. That probably complicates your feelings towards her. She is your dad's affair partner. If your mom lived,  your stepmom wouldn't have replaced your mom,  only separated your parents so her own daughter could have a dad. Point that out to Paige.", "Age has nothing to do with whether or not people have similar experiences, what a dense father!  It amazes me how some people just seem to be able to flip a switch and have no feelings or consideration for another\u2019s feelings.  Mind blown!  Good luck!", "NTA but maybe this has gotten out of hand. Everyone else doesn\u2019t understand even though your dad should despite being in a hard place. \nMaybe you can try to diffuse the situation by getting some distance and writing down your thoughts in a letter or text to the three of them that you do care for your stepmom but you don\u2019t ever want it to feel like it\u2019s a competition because you love your mom too and no matter what the relationship/ your feelings won\u2019t be exactly like Paige and your dad\u2019s.", "Nta", "You are NTA but your dad and step-mom sure as heck are.\n\nThey should have respected your boundaries more instead of trying to force you into accepting a narrative that made *them* feel good. And Sandra saying your mom \"sent her\" when your dad started dating her BEFORE she died is wild. Like, wow.\n\nI have a lot of sympathy for Paige because she was just a child who was hyped up into thinking she would have a new sister, but the \"sister\" refused to be interested. It's not your fault, but I get it. But she fucked up when she sided with Sandra on trying to make your wedding about them instead of growing out of her bubble.\n\nThe only thing I could say about you is that you *probably* could have tried to be nicer to Sandra and Paige as a kid, even if you didn't see them as family. But you were a grieving kid who was given (I'm assuming) no therapy and little emotional support for your mourning. Your dad isn't exactly wrong for moving you 2 in with them, because he's ultimately a human who deserves to be happy too. But he did it without caring for your feelings in the slightest and only cared about how you could have benefitted him.\n\nI'm happy you have your mom's jewelry. It makes a wedding outfit extra special. Paige can wear it as a guest (assuming they're invited) if it means so much.", "NTA and I'm sorry you have shitty family members that never allowed you to grieve.\n\nTell Paige it's petty and spiteful for her mom to get that twisted about you wearing your mom's necklace. And you weren't wishing anything on her, you were telling her that she was not in your situation. She didn't have a new dad pushed on her, she got an extra one. You got a new adult that was weirdly obsessed with being a replacement mom.", "NTA but I will be the rare one to comment that I think you\u2019ve held on to past arguments for to long. Grieving a loved one has no time limits. I understand them being pushy makes it so much harder. And you\u2019re getting married which is stirring up a lot of emotions. I hope you can find peace with this situation. Your stepmother and stepsister don\u2019t sound like bad people. They\u2019ve made mistakes. Their human. Maybe one day you will see that they seem to truly care about you. They didn\u2019t kill your mother. No one can ever replace your mother.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Sandra couldn't leave it when you told her no thank you.", "NTA\n\nNot one of the people you've described could ever have even tried to imagine what it was like for you to lose your mom, and then to push and push you to pretend to love strangers... how shallow and unfeeling could they be.  I'm so so sorry, OP.  I'm glad you have your mother's necklace. \n\nYou know, you don't have to even invite your steps or your dad to your wedding.  I know you don't have a lot of family, but still, you don't have to have them there.", "NTA sounds like it\u2019s time to go no contact with the three of them. You dad is the biggest AH of all bc his job was 1st and foremost to protect you and he failed.", "NTA\n\nWhat are with people that can't take no for an answer. It's a nice offer, sure. that should have been the end of this story.", "Neither your dad nor your stepmom allowed the 8 year old you were to grieve for the parent that died unexpectedly. You loved and missed your mom. \n\nYour situations are completely different and while you have matured, doesn't seem like your stepsister has. I have to blame that on your stepmother. \n\nWhy in the world would your stepmother complain to her bio-daughter that you won't wear her necklace? Then complain that you're wearing your bio-mom's necklace. You know your stepmom also said how hurt she was.   She's 20 years older and has learned nothing about being a stepmom, let alone a mom.\n\nYour dad is so wrong, he wasn't that 8 year old girl who needed to grieve and not have a female figure shoved down their throat as a new mom.  An 8 year old would be thrilled to go into a store to buy a new doll.... they expected the same excitement  when introducing a stepmom into that child's family circle. \n\nToday you may be about the age your bio patents we're when tragedy happened, but not even remotely the same situation. \n\nYou pointing out the difference between an 8 year old who knew and loved a parent who died being vastly different than never knowing a parent so therefore never loved them is extremely valid. You both got a new parent, but for only one of you it was their first time to have two parents in their life. \n\nYou'd think at 27 she'd realize that, yet she doesn't and is taking everything very personally just like her biomom. \n\nNTA.... you handled the situation calmly and with maturity that is lacking in the others.  Wear your mom's necklace and have a wonderful life.", "I will never understand why new parents feel entitled to love and affection and relationship and don\u2019t feel like they have to give a child space and earn it. Nor will I understand why new parents to go out of their way to help a child honor their deceased parent. Sandra should be happy for you that you have your moms jewelry to wear, she should be asking what she can do to help you honor your mom at your wedding. How dare she think she deserves the spot on your neck. This is true insane and you are NTA", "NTA.  Your circumstances are different.  Losing a parent, and immediately being pressed into a new family, must have been very difficult.  Did you have any counselling at all for grief?  Any support?  Were you encouraged at all to talk about your mom with your dad or anyone?  From what I'm reading here, it doesn't seem like it.  \n\n\nThat's the difference between you and Paige, it seems:  her dad was never around, so while she feels the pain of absence in a different way, there isn't the same mourning followed by people urging her to replace someone very loved.  She had someone step into a long-open vacancy that she grew to care for.  And while yes, it seems Sandra does want to try and care for you, I don't see anything wrong with saying, \"Thank you, but no thank you\" to her offer.    \n\n\nYour delivery was harsh but understandable.", "I agree that OP should distance herself if she makes herself and her feelings heard in a respectful way, because I do think a lot of the blame is on dad/ stepmom for not being understanding and handling things better when OP was younger, but OP is an adult now and there\u2019s all this drama/ hurt built up to the point where it seems like no one can communicate anything real. If OP does want to try for a relationship it\u2019s a start\u2026. Not some magic rainbows and unicorns cure-all.", "If I were OP I'd keep wicked step sister and step mother the hell out of my life. \n\nNTA", "NTA", "Nta. Paige was way tf out of line go come pester you", "NTA, if you don\u2019t want something, then don\u2019t let anyone force you to be someone you aren\u2019t", "Paige would have gotten her feelings hurt.", "All of this.", "Dad is still feeling guilt over having an affair and his wife dying. But pretending it didn\u2019t happen that way.", "I have zero sympathy for Paige. She sounds pushy, spoiled, and frankly obnoxious as hell. She got the best of both worlds. She got to keep her mom and she got a dad. She didn\u2019t lose anything in this.", "I\u2019m glad you voted NTA but it\u2019s not out of hand. \n\nThis man moved in a stranger and forced her into his daughters life immediately after his wife died. This poor girl\u2019s mom passed away. \n\nShe lost her mom to death, and he forced this woman onto her. It\u2019s despicable. Writing a letter isn\u2019t going to change anything if it did we were all right letters and everything will get better. She\u2019s done everything right and this family is disgusting.", "What did you read that you think they sound like good people? They sound horrible.", "Paige is 27 years old. She is old enough to know when to drop a subject. NTA", "Claiming your mom sent her is bananacrackers insane because they started dating before your mom died. They started dating before they were even divorced! The math does not math!", ">Every time Sandra has claimed mom sent her to me I want to scream at her again but I don't.\n\nYou have more restraint than I would.  I'd have said something really mean, like, \"if my mom had picked a new mom out for me, it would have been someone a lot better than you.  Someone who respects boundaries, for one.\"\n\nFfs, your dad was already dating her when your mom passed! Did she think your mom's ghost went back in time to find Sandra and have her meet your dad at the gym or wherever the fuck.  \n\nThat's just stupid, in addition to being insensitive and everything else.", "Saying your deceased parent sent her is such a weird and off putting thing to say to a child.", "Entitled narcissists don't see those things and hoping they do is a fool's errand.  As someone with a sister like that, I know how it goes.", "I had a friend in highschool whose dad passed away around the same time my parents were getting a divorce and my dad was spending less and less time with us. She tried to empathize with me and compare our situations. I told her that they really weren't comparable, my dad was still alive, I could still see him although not the way I wanted. And her dad didn't choose to get sick, he didn't choose to leave while mine did. They were both awful situations but not the same.", "I don\u2019t think people understand how wonderful going low or no contact can be. \n\nI hope your wedding goes off without a hitch as they say, and I\u2019m again so sorry for the loss of your mom at such a young age.", "Not to diminish your situation, but take both Sandra and your mom out of the situation. y\nYou have your jewelry picked out. Anyone that would offer you a necklace would be ridiculous to get upset at you when you informed them that you already have a necklace. Period.", "Sandra is gross", "Never.", "To finally honor the great mom that op has shunned all these years... I would not bet against you, I think you're spot on.", "I can see it making sense for a young kid when the loss isn\u2019t recent, but that isn\u2019t what this is."]}
