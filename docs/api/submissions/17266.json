You\u2019re going to get a lot of people patting you on the back and validating you in this thread because this sub is radically pro \u201cfuck your family, fuck everyone else, your wants/needs matter more\u201d. And sometimes that\u2019s really true! But sometimes, that attitude is cruel.

I may well decide I don't want anything to do with her after, but either way I want my money, but my mother says that's manipulative.\n\nThis also concerns me. A big reason addicts relapse is because they try very hard to do all the right things in recovery and people still treat them like they are dangerous, untrustworthy, or otherwise incapable of recovery, and they start to believe that (if that\u2019s the only way anyone is going to see me, what\u2019s the point?) You aren\u2019t obligated to forgive her. But dangling forgiveness over her head when you know there\u2019s a good chance you won\u2019t actually offer it feels kind of\u2026 problematic? Risky? I don\u2019t know. \n\nHave you gotten therapy?", "Can't criticise you for insisting that she pay you back what she stole and I can't imagine the nightmare of having to deal with an addicted sibling.\n\nThat said, please, please don't deceive her into making her repay what she stole only for you to tell her to fuck off once she'd paid off what she owes.\n\nShe clearly made some appalling choices and no doubt damaged, if not destroyed, relationships with many of her former friends and family. Although I have never succumbed myself, one of the blokes in my friend group when I was younger got ensnared by addiction and the drugs took over. It was like watching someone die a slow death. He disappeared completely and all we saw was a marionette, a puppet controlled by the drugs he was taking.\n\nIf she is working her tits off to pay you back, even at pennies per week, she clearly has a desire to try to repair some of the damage she caused. Be angry with her, be disappointed with her but please reward her for the effort she is making in putting things right.\n\nYou don't have to get her to look after your kids or lend her your car or let her move in but let her see that a positive act on her behalf is rewarded by a positive act on your behalf. If you don't, there's a risk she will see little point in doing anything good for anyone as it's not appreciated so why not spend the money she was giving you on some skanky shit and returning to her nihilistic ways?\n\nI am no psychologist or therapist but from a human perspective, and I'm sure I'll be corrected if I'm wrong, the next time she comes, why not offer her a coffee or something and a ten-minute chat? Make your contact and exchanges contingent on her continued repayment of your debt but give her something to let her know there is value in making amends or at least trying to.\n\nNTA but don't be too horrible to her now.", "ESH.\n\nYour sister in younger years was an AH but it looks like she is trying to fix it. \n\nYour mom has no right to say what you should do. She can give advice but she cant tell you what to do that's an AH move.\n\nLets talk about you now. You did nothing wrong overall and after your experiences with your sister you dont wanna trust her and its understandable but I also think if someone is not letting others have a chance again because of dumb or disgusting stuff they did in younger times kinda makes you being right a lot less. End of the day, she give half of your money back and trying to retun the rest and also trying to be a better person. Still after that you dont have to forgive her but I also think sometimes we should pick people up from ground if they are trying their best. Past is past and experiences will sting with you but reminding her again and again what she did in past doesnt help either. After everything she is trying to make it better, I think you should at least acknowledge what she is doing, like i said you dont habe to forgive her, just acknowledge it. Otherwise you also sound like an AH, not much but by a little. \n\nEveryone could have done so much better in this situation but sometimes it doesnt happen that way in life. ESH for me with you being the least AH person there.", "ESH you\u2019re not manipulative but I think you\u2019re being cruel. You should really be making it clear that you may not wish to have a relationship after all of this. This has been going on for years of her consistently showing she\u2019s clean and giving you every single bit of money she has, addiction is a disease and she has clearly done everything to make amends. You don\u2019t have to forgive her but I think you\u2019re continuing to punish her unnecessarily. She sucks for obvious reasons with her issues in the past but I really think you should evaluate whether you actually want a relationship with her instead of dangling it in front of her head. What do you think will happen if she pays it all back and you slam the door in her face? All of the work, starving herself to pay you for you to tell her to go fuck herself at the end, seems cruel to me and could potentially cause relapses. Either have a start the basis of building a relationship slowly or tell her you don\u2019t want a relationship and she better not show up until she has the full amount. Having her show up every week for years for you to ignore her and take her money isn\u2019t going to fix your relationship, it\u2019s just you continuing punishment. I suppose it comes down to do you want to heal or do you just want what\u2019s owed?", "NTA I think it\u2019s important she make amends and continue to feel the impact of her actions.", "Very sodt YTA. I get you're angry, I seriously get how shitty she fucked up your relationship. And your not yta for wanting the money back, you are however for placing the condition of making your relationship with her be9ng dependent on the money being paid first. \n\nMainly because it's stupid from a practical point. You are creating a condition which is almost unattainable for a recovering drug addict. And she will continue to feel useless because she cant attain that goal. Do you know what happens when addicts start to feel useless?, they are placed in a negative space where its highly likely to could relapse. Now I'm not saying it would be your fault of she did, absolutely not. Simply that your creating extra obstacles for your sister. \n\nIf you really don't want a relationship ever just say that and let yourself and her move on. Stop trying to gain some revenge for history, because honestly she'll barely remember everything she did and likely feels fucking awful for. \n\nIf you really do want a relationship then start building it slowly NOW not under the completion of her paying you back. But of you do that, you need to accept she will always be a drug addict, there is NO such thing as a former addict.\n\n Her life will always be hard, and whilst I do not think you or anyone owes her anything, if you want a relationship you need to accept the reality that you will need to consider her addiction with every interaction you have with her (and I don't mean assume she'll relapse, instead have empathy towards her life) \n\nI'm saying all this as a person who grow up in a household with drugs, where that drug addict was often prioritised above me, where literal drug dealers threatened me. And with a sister who is now also an addict. I choose to cut ties 100% with my uncle (the first person I mentioned). I did it because it was healthier for me. I choose to stay in my sisters life, but our relationship  is fairly top level. I check in with her, tell her I love her and listen to her. But i also accept all the shit she has done, and move on. \n\nOn top of all that, it's simply healthier for you. See this anger, uour letting the fuckihg drugs drag you down too. Do t let them..", "ESH. In general you have the right to be paid back and the right to choose to have a relationship or not. However this definitely seems like some sort of power trip thing. Do you actually intent to have a relationship with her when she\u2019s done paying you back? If so, why not start now as she seems to be showing a legitimate effort to making this right?", "I think you need to consider the majority of these replies will be coming from people who do not have any experience working with addictions. Plus AITA tends to bring in crowd with a black and white type of thinking.\n\nYour sister got addicted to hard-core drugs during a key development stage for her brain. The teenage years are the hardest development years for everyone with the rapid change in hormone and new perspection of self. We need to consider that addiction is a disease, and she will never be able to return to her pre drug self as that person was a child. \n\nYou are a victim of her behaviour. You do not owe her or anyone a relationship with you. You are owed the money she stole. \n\nBut I think its imperative that you ask yourself why this way of handling it is so important to you.\n\nDo you want her to suffer like you did as a consequence of her actions? Did she make you feel unimportant or neglected by her actions? Do you want her to feel the same? Did you struggle due to loss of income that she took? Do you want her to know how it feels? Do you feel the profound sense of loss has left you feeling rage at the mere memory of what she done? Do you feel bitter at what she could have become/ what your relationship should have been? Do you think she'll relapse and this is your way of protecting yourself? Do you want her to relapse because you only see her as a drug addict and for her to be different now means the pain you went through because of her actions are even more meaningless?\n\nI don't think anyone in the situation will be handling this healthy. This has been traumatic for your family. I think it will be even more traumatic if she relapses. If she's struggling to eat because of poverty then she might. \n\nShe is making incredible efforts to pay you back. She had gotten clean from hard-core teenage drug abuse. These are incredible things. By dangling your forgiveness on a stick you are possibly contributing to further trauma that your family will go through if she relapses. Do your parents deserve that? Her actions are not your fault, but your actions are your own. Just like she has brought undue stress to your family with the decisions she's made, you could potentially do the same if you punish her into relapse.\n\nYou don't need to forgive her. But you need to ask yourself if this is how you want to handle this. I suggest you use the money she is giving you for therapy, ask her for payments once a month instead. This means you won't have to see her as often and she'll have the chance to eat. During therapy, decide with a professional if the relationship with her is worth it. If so great, if not, that's for her to respect. \n\nTake care OP, family trauma is hard. Let's not turn this into generational trauma with unresolved anger. \n\nVery very very soft, YTA", "YTA. I understand you were hurt, but she very clearly has been making strong strides in making amends. Addiction is a poisonous thing and can make even the strongest person do awful things, things she clearly seems to regret.\n\nShe obviously values you a lot to be trying this hard and still not expressing frustration at you stone walling her, but honestly, part of what makes recovery successful is the small kindness and support along the way.\n\nIf you continue to ignore her while accepting the money she gives you each week, then who knows? Maybe she might think none of this is worth it and just suffers a relapse. At this point you're basically being cruel for the sake of it.", "NTA\n\nit\u2019s called tough love", "NTA.

Your sister also did not attack you for wanting her to pay back what she stole-- it's your MOTHER who is turning you from victim into perpetrator.  \n\nYou are NTA\n\nAs far as this post reads, I believe you might want to consider that your sister is NTA anymore either.  Your mother is TA.\n\nYou're perfectly entitled to not trust or want a relationship with your sister.  That is ok.  I'm just saying that people do change.  Having said that, you don't have to invite them back into your life after multiple betrayals and theft.", "YTA\n\nYou are not an asshole for wanting repaid - I see that as being a completely fair request, and something your sister will have to work towards.\n\nWhat I do see you as an asshole for is for refusing to even speak to her until her debt is paid. This isn't asking for repayment or an apology, this is purposely choosing to try and hurt her as an act of revenge, and what does it accomplish?\n\nYes she needs to repay you, and yes, she needs to rebuild your trust (which will take time), but why can't the two happen at the same time?", "NTA. This is a matter between you and your sister. If your mom really wants to get involved, SHE can lend your sister the amount she owes you. Sister can pay you back with that, then pay your mom back in smaller increments. Your sister needs to realize how much she put you through and paying you back is a good reminder.", "NTA, you are NOT being manipulative. Part of recovery is \"making amends\", in this case, you don't feel amends have been made because YOU HAVE NOT BEEN MADE WHOLE. It is counter productive to recovery for the addict NOT TO BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE for the damage/loss/theft of others' property. Let your mom twist in the wind if she wants to be a doormat.\n\nEdited for spelling", "honestly, esh\u2026 i get your anger, i understand it, and it\u2019s justified. but your sister not only got clean (an incredibly difficult feat) but is making tough choices to pay you back, all so she can have a relationship with you. she sucks for stealing your money, but she\u2019s changing, and if you\u2019re going to keep punishing her i\u2019d say just cut contact. she doesn\u2019t need the stress. your mom sucks for trying to coerce you, but she\u2019s coming from a good place. you suck because you\u2019re still treating your sister like the irresponsible addict she was, and for her to move on she should be treated like the person she is now. she\u2019s atoning for her mistakes, and she doesn\u2019t need you punishing her on top of it. i can\u2019t fault you for wanting your money back, but stop punishing her all the while. will you even treat her well or make an effort once she\u2019s repaid you, or will you continue punishing her? you\u2019re not an asshole for wanting your money back, you\u2019re an asshole for how you\u2019re poorly treating a woman who\u2019s trying her hardest to set things straight. she may have fucked up, yes more than others, but right now you\u2019re fucking up by putting her through more. if she\u2019s willing to skip meals just so she can pay you, doesn\u2019t that show you anything? how much she cares, how much she wants you back? you don\u2019t ever need to fully forgive her, but you are taking anger out on her for who she used to be. at this point, i kinda hope she stops trying with you, and just pays the money back later, because her punishing herself now and doing things like skipping meals (who knows if she\u2019s getting proper nutrition at this point) isn\u2019t good for her. i hope she\u2019s okay.", "NTA\n\nWhy in the world would your parents want to excuse her from making amends and doing the hard things she has to do to gain trust and relationships back when she is fully committed to doing so? That is so respectable that she is sacrificing her own needs to gain a relationship with you again and I am hoping for your family that this is a new beginning.\n\nHonestly, $20 isn't a ton of money. She can still afford to eat if she is planning her meals well. If your parents are concerned, they should help her budget or drop in with some meals from time to time to help out. You can hold your child accountable and still celebrate their wins.", "To me, I find it commendable that the sister is skipping meals to pay back the money faster and more at a time.  It shows dedication and motivation to her recovery program.  However, the sister needs to realize (and she may) that it is about the amends, not the relationship or even forgiveness.  She's accepting full responsibility for her past actions and behaviors, but she certainly can not change it.  OP absolutely has every right and reason to choose against a relationship of any sort.\n\nYour mom, of course, wants the happy, peaceful and harmonious family, especially after so much upheaval and disappointment.  I get that.  But telling OP about the skipped meals is counterproductive.  Mom is trying to make it easier for sister and it should not be.  Also, it is simply none of the mom's business and she would benefit greatly from Al-Anon and/or therapy.  Besides, the sister may be replacing a meal with a piece of fruit or a granola bar.  \n\nA phrase often heard in recovery is, \"to thine one self be true\".  This applies to everyone!  I applaud OP for being true to herself and being clear that the money is only about the money.", "This is difficult because I can empathize with both sides. Relationships with addicts are complicated and difficult to navigate. You have to be ready for forgiveness and it\u2019s pretty clear that the OP isn\u2019t ready. And that\u2019s ok. However, leading her when OP has little to no plan to actually forgive her makes OP TA. When her debt is finally paid off and there is not forgiveness as she expects, could really be that small trigger for relapse. She has hope now and obviously has been trying her hardest to make amends. YTA for leading her on.", "NTA. Its your decision, but may I offer some advice.\n\nDon't make it about the money. I get it. It's a lot of money. Instead, make it about your sister maintaining her sobriety. It sounds like she's come a long way, and she's trying her best to make things right. \n\nMoney's just a thing. They make more every day. You only get this chance to make ammends once. \n\nEven if you have to set up a very long payment plan, something like paying you what she would've spent on drugs every -insert time period here- until it's paid off. Work with her.", "NTA until that very last bit. You\u2019re good as long as you\u2019ve been completely upfront with everyone that even when she pays it back you may still remain NC. If everyone thinks her paying you back will fix this including her and your mom and you just turn around and say ha gotcha I just wanted my money back you\u2019re kinda an ah for that.", "NTA. Only compromise I'd consider is some kind of conversation/ minor relationship to get her to stop skipping meals. That's a tricky needle to thread though, so I wouldn't blame you for not doing that", "NTA, she stole from you and is trying to repay you. It\u2019s not your fault she is \u201cstarving herself\u201d in order to increase the monthly checks. You seemed satisfied with the $20 per week. Also there\u2019s no guarantee that is actually what\u2019s happening, she could be lying to your mother. But if your mother wants to get involved so bad, she could pay you off herself. You didn\u2019t say whether or not you would accept that, but if your mom is serious about your sister wanting to repair things, then she should have no problem footing her bill herself.", "ESH. You need to be clear with your sister that you might not pursue a relationship with her once she's paid up. You also...should tell her not to skip meals to hasten this process. That you don't see an issue with that is messed up.", "NTA\n\nYou\u2019re actually doing her a huge favor even though it doesn\u2019t seem like it from every perspective\n\nAs another poster pointed out, she was probably skipping meals for crack too. \n\nAlso let your mom know that if she doesn\u2019t make these amends *on her own* that could be a slippery slope. Psychologically it\u2019s a huge step for her to do this.", "My sister died because of her meth addiction. This sister appears to be making a genuine effort, and for OPs sake I hope that\u2019s true. I understand why she wants her sister to make these amends. If sis can do that, it will go a long way towards building trust, which having been lied to 10,000x by my own sister about getting clean and making amends, I know is the biggest hurdle to having a relationship with a recovering addict. I would give anything to have my sister back, but to be honest by the end I was so fed up and disgusted by her shitty behavior her death was almost a relief, as awful as that sounds. I\u2019m still the primary financial support for her son, so even in death she\u2019s the center of attention in my family somehow. I love that kid and would die for him, but it\u2019s really unfair that my whole family is still held hostage by her addiction even after she\u2019s gone. Op is NTA because being the sibling of an addict is a lifelong struggle, and they deserve to know this change is real this time. I hope the parents back off and let the siblings figure things out for themselves. Enabling addicts only hurts- both the addicted person and the rest of the family. It\u2019s so sad!", "sister isn't owed a relationship. welcome the reality of being an ex addict. not everyone is going to forgive you.", "But her sister didn't care if OP had to skip meals when she stole from her, as long as she could get high. Why should OP be so concerned about her now? I don't think she's obligated to forgive the person that repeatedly robbed her.", "I agree. It is okay to want to be paid back. It is okay not to want a relationship with the sister. \n\nIt's not okay to promise a future relationship if there's no intention of sincerely following through.\n\nIt is okay to care for yourself. It is okay to say no to building a relationship. It is okay to want your money back. The thing where OP makes her sister jump through hoops is not okay.\n\nI don't think I can call anyone the AH in this scenario, though. Family dynamics / addictions is just so complex.", "AMEN", "But is seems like most people on here don't believe in being held accountable. Every poster that has posted THIS perspective has been downvoted; really makes you wonder how many of them have done same or similar to others.", ">Also there\u2019s no guarantee that is actually what\u2019s happening, she could be lying to your mother.\n\nThis.  The whole meal skipping thing reads as manipulative strategy to get the mother to pressure OP into dropping the whole thing and accepting her back.", "Are you using voice to text software by any chance?  \"Opie\" is cracking me up.", "Having your shit stolen sucks.  Having it be stolen by a family member in the throes of Addiction sucks a ton.  I've had it happen multiple times. \n\nI don't think you can really compare that to the long incredibly hard process of getting clean from addiction.  Especially as OP hasn't gone through any of the work to process this and forgive her sister.\n\nGetting sober is one of the hardest things many people have to do.  Don't diminish that accomplishment", "Lmao no, just no. \n\nNot saying OP have to forgive or anything, but getting sober is incredibly hard.", "This is the excuse most additcs try (have worked in rehab) Addiction is the ADDICTS issue, no one, absolutely NO ONE is responsible for the addict relapsing.", "It sounds like OP has made that clear though? She said in her post that she's told her mother that even when she's paid back she's only willing to *consider* forgiving her, which is her right IMHO. \n\nThe sister wanted to know what she could do to earn OPs trust and forgiveness. Repaying the money only barely makes them square, financially speaking. I know 2k meant a lot more to me in my early 20s than it does now.\n\nThen she still has to make up for the breach of trust that happens when you decide to repeatedly rob your siblings.", "IT'S not a humiliation. What if this was a court ordered lien? She would STILL not be having a conversation with sibling when payments are taken, held in escrow and eft or mailed to the VICTIM OF SAID THEFT. smdh\n\nPeople on this thread are too caught up on \"but faaaaaamily\" BS. And YES, I have cut people out of my life for involving themselves in drug issues that affected MY household and had and HAVE every right to do so. It's only a humiliation when the addict won't admit WHY there is no conversation with the offended party.", "I think you can regain trustworthiness if you improve your character.\n\nOP\u2019s sister seems to have been consistently paying off the debt even if it means missing meals.

OPs sister can control whether or not she stays sober, but OP can't decide not to get robbed.", "Frankly, I'm not sure that OP does want to have a relationship with the sister. And that's her right. Some bridges can't be unburned. Not wanting a relationship with someone who has experienced addiction is a legitimate choice, same as wanting to support the recovering addict. Neither one is wrong. \n\nWhat I'm saying is, if OP just wants her money back and to move on with her life, that's okay. But I do think she should stop dangling a future relationship in front of the sister's nose if she doesn't intend on following through.

You think sister will stop paying if she's allowed to pay through a more convenient method?", "Just curious how you decide which words to capitalize? Also, why? The way I read this in my head makes you sound a bit unhinged.", "This is one of those situations where OP is somewhat justified, but still an AH.", "I understand where you're coming from but do keep in mind that all three of them are fully functioning adults, and I believe the mother taught all of them at some point that when you make a mistake or do something wrong you have to do all you can to make it right if you either want to be a good person or it really matters to you. $2,200 is not easy to come by if I remember from the post and Opie in some eyes seems like a jerk but we don't know how many times Opie has crashed and burned all because of their sister. I'll be using the right to choose whether or not to forgive or forget, as well as choose to get back the money. One day Opie will forgive and let their sister in but till then time is needed.", ">Wouldnt you want to be a better person?\n\nanother SJW.

LOL\n\n>Your comment is basically saying that you would treat someone just as bad. Wouldnt you want to be a better person?\n\nOP isn't stealing from her sister or pawning her car.

But it would make their sibling a sober asshole who manipulated someone they supposedly grew up with loving in order to get back some cash under false pretenses. \n\nOP stole money by deception and manipulation as well.  Addiction isn't an excuse because addicts don't have to steal from family and there are some who don't resort to exploiting the kindness of family to fund their addiction. \n\nEven sober OPs sisters story reeks of manipulation to have her cake and eat it too by enlisting her mother. \n\n \n\n>But they certainly don\u2019t get to be a manipulative jerk to someone who is clearly vulnerable and trying either and get to use how they were treated as some sort of license to be a asshole.\n\nYes, actually that's exactly what it means.  OP is owed her money back no matter how she acts.  And she can get it back however she sees fit.  Her sister is lucky and should be grateful OP didn't legally seek an order for payment and come after more of her sisters money.", "Cool but did you miss the part where I didn't talk about the addict?\n\nAlso \"making amends\" is a 12 step thing and 12 step programs are of dubious moral authority at best.\n\nWeird caps too", ">OP doesn't owe her sister a relationship, regardless if she is made whole or not.\n\nYes\n\n>It's her sisters moral and legal obligation to make OP whole again,\n\nmoral maybe, legal no. \n\n>OP's sister has caused her probably an insane amount of emotional and financial pain that cannot be quantified to a dollar amount, and that can't really be repaid.\n\nSure. \n\n>the best interest of both for OP to start building the relationship again,\n\nDisagree, because OP doesn't have any interest in it. That's the whole point, it's not about the money. OP's title is a lie. The money isn't a requisite for a relationship, they're just trying to dangle the possibility of one to get paid. \n\nThe saying is Hurt people hurt people. And that's what OP is doing. They got hurt, and now they are using the same relationship to hurt their sister. The barrier to OP's relationship isn't the money, it's deeper. \n\nPlus, OPs post *drips* of condescension. Their sister has been clean, theoretically, for 5 years. Potentially clean longer than she was a addict. And it's clear the OP cannot or doesn't want to acknowledge that, and would rather dwell on the parts of her life that she got hurt by. Which is fine. But honestly?

Thank you for the addition :)", "I don't know anything about a more convenient method, I'm responding to the fact that OP's mom asked her to forgive her sister's debt to her.

OP is not at fault for sister starving.

Anymore than any other victims affected by the actions of an addict. You don't get absolution just because you are related.", "So not forgiving the person who robbed you is just as much of a \"breach of trust\" as...actually robbing your family members? \n\nNo. It's absolutely reasonable for OP to never forgive her sister.

This is just based on what OPs mom told her in the phone call. Part of recovery is making amends and ACCEPTING that you may NOT be forgiven (burned bridges).

Am not bitter, just realistic that sometimes the bridges are burned so badly that you have to go NO CONTACT for self preservation.", "So then let addicts abuse \"the disease\" instead of abusing their innocent family and friends. Being a victim doesn't excuse turning around and victimizing someone else. You're allowed to lash out at your abuser though, that is the distinction here.
