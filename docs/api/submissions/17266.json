A big reason addicts relapse is because they try very hard to do all the right things in recovery and people still treat them like they are dangerous, untrustworthy, or otherwise incapable of recovery, and they start to believe that (if that\u2019s the only way anyone is going to see me, what\u2019s the point?) You aren\u2019t obligated to forgive her. But dangling forgiveness over her head when you know there\u2019s a good chance you won\u2019t actually offer it feels kind of\u2026 problematic? Risky? I don\u2019t know. \n\nHave you gotten therapy?", "Can't criticise you for insisting that she pay you back what she stole and I can't imagine the nightmare of having to deal with an addicted sibling.\n\nThat said, please, please don't deceive her into making her repay what she stole only for you to tell her to fuck off once she'd paid off what she owes.\n\nShe clearly made some appalling choices and no doubt damaged, if not destroyed, relationships with many of her former friends and family. Although I have never succumbed myself, one of the blokes in my friend group when I was younger got ensnared by addiction and the drugs took over. It was like watching someone die a slow death. He disappeared completely and all we saw was a marionette, a puppet controlled by the drugs he was taking.\n\nIf she is working her tits off to pay you back, even at pennies per week, she clearly has a desire to try to repair some of the damage she caused. Be angry with her, be disappointed with her but please reward her for the effort she is making in putting things right.\n\nYou don't have to get her to look after your kids or lend her your car or let her move in but let her see that a positive act on her behalf is rewarded by a positive act on your behalf. If you don't, there's a risk she will see little point in doing anything good for anyone as it's not appreciated so why not spend the money she was giving you on some skanky shit and returning to her nihilistic ways?\n\nI am no psychologist or therapist but from a human perspective, and I'm sure I'll be corrected if I'm wrong, the next time she comes, why not offer her a coffee or something and a ten-minute chat? Make your contact and exchanges contingent on her continued repayment of your debt but give her something to let her know there is value in making amends or at least trying to.\n\nNTA but don't be too horrible to her now.", "ESH.\n\nYour sister in younger years was an AH but it looks like she is trying to fix it. \n\nYour mom has no right to say what you should do. She can give advice but she cant tell you what to do that's an AH move.\n\nLets talk about you now. You did nothing wrong overall and after your experiences with your sister you dont wanna trust her and its understandable but I also think if someone is not letting others have a chance again because of dumb or disgusting stuff they did in younger times kinda makes you being right a lot less. End of the day, she give half of your money back and trying to retun the rest and also trying to be a better person. Still after that you dont have to forgive her but I also think sometimes we should pick people up from ground if they are trying their best. Past is past and experiences will sting with you but reminding her again and again what she did in past doesnt help either. After everything she is trying to make it better, I think you should at least acknowledge what she is doing, like i said you dont habe to forgive her, just acknowledge it. Otherwise you also sound like an AH, not much but by a little. \n\nEveryone could have done so much better in this situation but sometimes it doesnt happen that way in life. ESH for me with you being the least AH person there.", "ESH you\u2019re not manipulative but I think you\u2019re being cruel. You should really be making it clear that you may not wish to have a relationship after all of this. This has been going on for years of her consistently showing she\u2019s clean and giving you every single bit of money she has, addiction is a disease and she has clearly done everything to make amends. You don\u2019t have to forgive her but I think you\u2019re continuing to punish her unnecessarily. She sucks for obvious reasons with her issues in the past but I really think you should evaluate whether you actually want a relationship with her instead of dangling it in front of her head. What do you think will happen if she pays it all back and you slam the door in her face? All of the work, starving herself to pay you for you to tell her to go fuck herself at the end, seems cruel to me and could potentially cause relapses. Either have a start the basis of building a relationship slowly or tell her you don\u2019t want a relationship and she better not show up until she has the full amount. Having her show up every week for years for you to ignore her and take her money isn\u2019t going to fix your relationship, it\u2019s just you continuing punishment. I suppose it comes down to do you want to heal or do you just want what\u2019s owed?", "NTA I think it\u2019s important she make amends and continue to feel the impact of her actions.", "Very sodt YTA. I get you're angry, I seriously get how shitty she fucked up your relationship. And your not yta for wanting the money back, you are however for placing the condition of making your relationship with her be9ng dependent on the money being paid first. \n\nMainly because it's stupid from a practical point. You are creating a condition which is almost unattainable for a recovering drug addict. And she will continue to feel useless because she cant attain that goal. Do you know what happens when addicts start to feel useless?, they are placed in a negative space where its highly likely to could relapse. Now I'm not saying it would be your fault of she did, absolutely not. Simply that your creating extra obstacles for your sister. \n\nIf you really don't want a relationship ever just say that and let yourself and her move on. Stop trying to gain some revenge for history, because honestly she'll barely remember everything she did and likely feels fucking awful for. \n\nIf you really do want a relationship then start building it slowly NOW not under the completion of her paying you back. But of you do that, you need to accept she will always be a drug addict, there is NO such thing as a former addict.\n\n Her life will always be hard, and whilst I do not think you or anyone owes her anything, if you want a relationship you need to accept the reality that you will need to consider her addiction with every interaction you have with her (and I don't mean assume she'll relapse, instead have empathy towards her life) \n\nI'm saying all this as a person who grow up in a household with drugs, where that drug addict was often prioritised above me, where literal drug dealers threatened me. And with a sister who is now also an addict. I choose to cut ties 100% with my uncle (the first person I mentioned). I did it because it was healthier for me. I choose to stay in my sisters life, but our relationship  is fairly top level. I check in with her, tell her I love her and listen to her. But i also accept all the shit she has done, and move on. \n\nOn top of all that, it's simply healthier for you. See this anger, uour letting the fuckihg drugs drag you down too. Do t let them..", "ESH. In general you have the right to be paid back and the right to choose to have a relationship or not. However this definitely seems like some sort of power trip thing. Do you actually intent to have a relationship with her when she\u2019s done paying you back? If so, why not start now as she seems to be showing a legitimate effort to making this right?", "I think you need to consider the majority of these replies will be coming from people who do not have any experience working with addictions. Plus AITA tends to bring in crowd with a black and white type of thinking.\n\nYour sister got addicted to hard-core drugs during a key development stage for her brain. The teenage years are the hardest development years for everyone with the rapid change in hormone and new perspection of self. We need to consider that addiction is a disease, and she will never be able to return to her pre drug self as that person was a child. \n\nYou are a victim of her behaviour. You do not owe her or anyone a relationship with you. You are owed the money she stole. \n\nBut I think its imperative that you ask yourself why this way of handling it is so important to you.\n\nDo you want her to suffer like you did as a consequence of her actions? Did she make you feel unimportant or neglected by her actions? Do you want her to feel the same? Did you struggle due to loss of income that she took? Do you want her to know how it feels? Do you feel the profound sense of loss has left you feeling rage at the mere memory of what she done? Do you feel bitter at what she could have become/ what your relationship should have been? Do you think she'll relapse and this is your way of protecting yourself? Do you want her to relapse because you only see her as a drug addict and for her to be different now means the pain you went through because of her actions are even more meaningless?\n\nI don't think anyone in the situation will be handling this healthy. This has been traumatic for your family. I think it will be even more traumatic if she relapses. If she's struggling to eat because of poverty then she might. \n\nShe is making incredible efforts to pay you back. She had gotten clean from hard-core teenage drug abuse. These are incredible things. By dangling your forgiveness on a stick you are possibly contributing to further trauma that your family will go through if she relapses. Do your parents deserve that? Her actions are not your fault, but your actions are your own. Just like she has brought undue stress to your family with the decisions she's made, you could potentially do the same if you punish her into relapse.\n\nYou don't need to forgive her. But you need to ask yourself if this is how you want to handle this. I suggest you use the money she is giving you for therapy, ask her for payments once a month instead. This means you won't have to see her as often and she'll have the chance to eat. During therapy, decide with a professional if the relationship with her is worth it. If so great, if not, that's for her to respect. \n\nTake care OP, family trauma is hard. Let's not turn this into generational trauma with unresolved anger. \n\nVery very very soft, YTA", "YTA. I understand you were hurt, but she very clearly has been making strong strides in making amends. Addiction is a poisonous thing and can make even the strongest person do awful things, things she clearly seems to regret.\n\nShe obviously values you a lot to be trying this hard and still not expressing frustration at you stone walling her, but honestly, part of what makes recovery successful is the small kindness and support along the way.\n\nIf you continue to ignore her while accepting the money she gives you each week, then who knows? Maybe she might think none of this is worth it and just suffers a relapse. At this point you're basically being cruel for the sake of it.", "NTA\n\nit\u2019s called tough love", "NTA.

A few months after we got together, he felt safe/comfortable with me enough to be open about him using again while i was against it i couldnt do much, i want in a good living situation. things were very rough at that point. i accept that he was using maybe 1 or 2 times a week but that want true obviously. he started to use more often and hurt our finances/my job with actions/my credit by taking out loans and not paying them \ud83d\ude11I put up with so much crap and for too damn long. He is still paying me back to this day as his family loves me and I love them; if I get invited there we are either civil, away from the other or he doesn't get invited lol  and it had been some time since we broke up \ud83d\ude05\n\n\nThey do this because they do love me and because they all know the pain and hurt someone goes through with an person with addiction because it is fuckin rough man, it's so easy to get burnt out when you're doing more for any relationship then the other person. THEY need to want to change, THEY are the ones that need to do the work for forgiveness, THEY the ones that need to show improvement and understand that just because you are forgiven doesn't mean things will/can ever be the same. My fav saying is that trust/love/respect is like a mirror once broken, it can be put back together, but it will never be the same. \n\nIf she has shown improvement it wouldn't hurt to see if the plan of putting it off until next pay but she has xx amount of time to pay until you do whatever and heck try taking her out to coffee/park if you want too and see if you two can have a very open and honest/brutal/without filter to get what you want out out conversation and use that as the 1st conversation to think about what was said/done and plan that day after/before the talk for the next meeting and give each other something yall need/is important and talk again about what you both need to. get cute little note books to write in and if you guys see yourself having a good relationship again then you can make it a bonding activity to decorate it together or really anything really but communication will help if that's what you want", "I'm on the fence here. You definitely have a right to the money, but you could also choose to show compassion. She used to be messed up. She stole from you. She was wrong. She was awful.\n\nAnd now she's sincerely trying to turn her life around.\n\nYou do NOT have any obligation to have any relationship with her at all. But showing mercy can be good for the soul, ya know?\n\nThat said, don't be a chump. The above assumes she's genuinely trying to change. Is she?", "ESH", "NTA, forgiveness happens on your timeline if it happens at all. Any program she's in for recovering addict will have told her that she needs to be ready for some bridges to not be rebuilt.", "Exactly, opie's mother already forgave but opie has a right to say no or yes. At the end of the day, when you wrong someone, you have to make amends, even if it takes time, as long as the person wants the relationship in the end. Opie's sister is free to not do so and have no relationship with opie. But the mother should respectively stay out of it because they are adults and need to settle it between themselves.", "Its the sister fault for being a f*uco up and a parasite. Who cares if paying back her sister for everything she stole is \"draining\" ots the least that she can do.", "It's really quite sad, that the usual \"a eye for an eye\" reddit Aita comes out in this one as a top comment and not more measured responses like your response.\n\nRequesting the money be paid back, sure, however op has purposely added humiliation and punishment by making her drop it off without conversation or acknowledgement. \n\nThere's nothing wrong with the hurt that your feeling, but what your doing here isn't helpful to your sisters recovery, isn't helpful to your relationship with her and serves no purpose other than to add some punishment to your sister. I get that your hurt, but you will not feel better by making her hurt. You don't want her inside her house, sure no problem, but your being an asshole about it.\n\nYTA.", "She's paid back half", "If someone were to come in to your home, with or without permission, steal your stuff, cause threats and break your trust for years, you might not forgive so fast would you? \n\nAnyway I don't know but Opie has a right to say yes or no, the sister realized she hurt her in the past and needs to fix it, or she can avoid opie. At the end of the day, Opie made her boundaries clear, opie sister should take care of herself but she has a choice to stop and never see opie again.", "People treat them like that because they are untrustworthy and will always be ready to relapse", "Why please?", "There was a part that opie's sister literally broke in to her house to steal her money or almost sold off her car.", "Yeah,  mom is the AH, also the sister.  Just go NC with the mom and LC with the sis (because of the money), after she pays go immediately NC /s.\n\nIf you don't want a relationship with your sister then that's fine. Don't blame your mom too already having decided wanting to have one", "And skipping meals. That's the part that got to me.", "You have never had an addiction, have you??", "Addiction doesn\u2019t absolve her of being responsible for the stuff she did. If she\u2019d killed someone by driving under the influence, would you be arguing for her to be forgiven for it just because she\u2019s an addict?", "Addiction is not a excuse even less being in recover . That sister does not deserve forgiveness", "If she sincerely repents, and is clean, she should be forgiven.", "Forgiveness is more for the forgiver than the forgiven", "Material objects dude. Take it from someone who grew up in foster care, forgiving becomes easier with empathy and attempted understanding", "Wow, I hope you never have a family member struggle with addiction. You're obviously completely ignorant and oblivious on what addiction actually is.\n\nBeing an addict, even a clean one, means that person does not deserve forgiveness? Ever? Even after they've begun or completed their amends?\n\nYou're TA in the comments of this post.", "Never said it was. I merely asked a question", "Sure, make bad choices and suffer the rest of your life because of them, THAT'LL teach them.\n\nBasic empathy could do you (and the world around you) a lot of good.", "Forrrr killing someone? For stealing money from OP and her roommates? I doubt the roommates have forgiven OP for her sister\u2019s actions; why should she forgive her sister?"]}
