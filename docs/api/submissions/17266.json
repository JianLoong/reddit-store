Eventually she started stealing from them, and me. She'd come by home to \"have dinner\" and take stuff out of my room. When I moved out she'd wait till all my roomates were gone, and steal our cash. She once even tried to pawn my car while it was parked in my driveway.\n\nI pretty much wrote her off by the time she was 20, and two years later she finally got busted in some drug den with huge amounts of drugs inside. She ended up getting three years, and got released two years ago. She's clean, and our parents have rebuilt their relationship, but I haven't. That's because as of last week she still owes me $2,200.\n\nShe's paid off half of what she stole from me over the years in money and belongings. The only interaction I have with her is when she drops off the cash every week, and I don't speak to her. She's usually only able to give me $20 each week, she's not exactly rich as you'd expect. Lately though it's been a little heavier.\n\nLast week my mother called and told me she's been skipping meals to give me extra cash. She wants me to stop, and just make up. I'm not considering that until we're square, and even then it's just a consideration.

She's doing what she has to do to make amends.  If that means paying you off in full, then it's best if she does it.  It's not your mother's business, it's between you and your sister.  I'm glad she's clean and working towards healing your relationship.", "Nta.  She stole, this is the retribution you require, and it\u2019s in your right to do so.  \n\nMom is enabling still imo", "NTA, she stole from you and you can seek to be even and you are not required to forgive her.\n\nAside from that it is clear you are still very angry and bitter which are entirely natural feelings, but I would encourage you to figure out how to let that go. That doesn't mean you have to forgive her though.", "NTA: your sister betrayed your trust and it's not up to your mom to tell you when to get over it. \n\nYou are clearly still very very hurt and unwilling to let her in.  I don't think she is missing meals to give him back $20 and I'd be wary that this is a manipulative way to get you to just drop it.  You're under no obligation to. \n\nIts good that she has someone willing to make their consequences firm. \n\nBut she has paid half of it back which to me, shows she is serious.  I wouldn't let the debt completely go but if it were me I'd open the door a bit emotionally and spend some time with her.", "NTA.

Your demand of repayment is fair.", "NTA - OP if she's clean and likely going through Narcotics Anonymous for her sobriety, then remind your mom Step 9 is making amends, which is what she's doing to you as part of the process.  Dropping the debt isn't doing her or you any favors.", "NTA if she stoled from you she has to pay it back.", "NTA. I can really relate to your situation - I have a sister who's an alcoholic and heavy drug user that did pretty much the same thing to me. I cut her out of my life over 25 years ago and it was the healthiest thing I've ever done. She's never gotten better.\n\nYou're not being unreasonable with your expectations. I do hope your sister stays sober and makes amends, and that one day the two of you have a healthy relationship.", "NTA. But I think I would tell her to stop giving me the money for some time.

Otherwise she can stay out of it. NTA.", "How much of has she already paid off?  She does seem to be making amends.  However, that said it's your call on when you are ready to start that journey with her, not hers and not your mother's.  So NTA.", "I get the hard feelings, especially if 2.2k is a lot of money for you- big bummer all the way around. Hope your sister pays you off and you can trust her enough to rebuild that relationship. \n\nI think building that trust involves your sister paying off her debt, but I\u2019m curious, how much has she paid down so far? Does she seem sincere in her penance?", "ESH. You can have a relationship with her whilst she pays you back. But her getting sober will have been harder than you can imagine and you should respect her for that and for starting to pay you back. Is it an apology you want? If so, say so. Forgiveness is hard But the constant punishing her this way is a drain on both of you.", "Your sister got addicted to drugs and hit rock bottom. She\u2019s trying to be a become a better person. You can help her or be indifferent. NAH", "Are you actually going to forgive her or have a relationship with her after she finishes?  If it\u2019s just the money, fine, but own it. Get your money and move on. But if you actually are interested or pretending to be interested in a relationship and are holding this over her, while she is actively trying, then YTA", "YTA.   She is skipping meals to pay you back!  She is trying.   She is trying. What more do you want? Will you even have a relationship with her when she pays you back? $2200 is a lot of money but it is not more important than family.", "YTA \n\nMostly for making her think that all this will mean she gets to have a relationship with you. If there wasn\u2019t the strings attached to the money sure, do whatever you want but it\u2019s cruel to make her believe there is a chance when it seems like there really isn\u2019t.\n\nEducate yourself about addiction. Her actions are not okay but you are not the only victim here.", "YTa \n\nfor giving her the false hope that she can win back your affection.\n\n\nNot for demanding your money back.", "YTA. These responses are wild. Do you owe your sister a relationship? Absolutely not. Is it fair for you to expect her to pay you back? Definitely. But making her come to your house weekly to drop off money and refusing to speak to her sounds like some weird manipulative revenge power trip that cannot possibly be healthy for either of you. How long has this been going on? All two years?\n\nAgain, you definitely don\u2019t owe her a relationship. But if she\u2019s consistently putting in the effort to do the thing you demanded as a prerequisite to even considering trying with her again, it feels like you should at least treat her like a human being at this point in the process. It sounds more like you want her to have this constant reminder every time she sees you that she fucked up, while dangling a carrot of maybe forgiveness if she grovels enough in the right way for long enough, and that\u2019s an AH move at the end of the day.", "Yta", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

That's good right? If she doesn't have the $20 (before anyone has a fit, twenty dollars can be the difference between a days food or no food for family)\nshe needs to talk to you directly, your Mum pulling her guilt bull isn't acceptable.

You're absolutely justifies in expecting her to pay you back, but do you really hate her so much that you don't care that she's going hungry to try to earn your forgiveness? She comes to your home and gives you all her spare cash including her food budget every week and you won't even talk to her.\n\nI understand that you were wronged by her, but I don't think this level of bitterness is good for you. Even if it's only for yourself, I think you should try to find a way to accept that she's changed and try to forgive her. I'm not saying you have to let her back in your life or that she shouldn't pay you back the money, but this just feels really unhealthy for everyone.\n\nAlso, you should make clear that repaying her debt doesn't necessarily mean that you guys will have a relationship.

But she paid you half over a period of time, and if you trust your mom on this then she actually forgo her meal to pay you. She is serious, and she is on the way there. You can distust her, but treat her seriously like she is right now. Your sister's action to payback and make amend right now is not TA. \n* You need help to deal with your emotions and trauma from the past zeeing you atill hold on to your anger and push back against the attempt to connect. Even if you don't forgive your sister (which is fine, you have right to do so), you should learn to let the past go, for you. You need therapy.\n* Your mom should let you process it and not push back onto you further and leave you to heal.

OP's sister should at least be told that there's no guarantee of a reconcilation even if she pays all the money back, so that she doesn't get her hopes up too high only to possibly have them dashed again. And these weird money handovers, like some kind of hostage swap with no one speaking, must be so awkward.
