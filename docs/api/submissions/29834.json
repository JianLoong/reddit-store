Me (19M) and my girlfriend Amanda (19F) have been dating for about 2 years now and are doing long distance right now while we're in college.\n\nAt the end of the term at Amanda's college, people will strip down and do a little run. We come from different backgrounds and definitely view our bodies differently, but I told her I wasn't really comfortable with her being out naked in front of a big crowd of other people, since I more view our naked bodies at something that's more intimate and should be reserved for each other. She got pissed and said it's her body and there's nothing sexual about the event so it shouldn't matter to me.\r\n\n\r  \nI felt kind of hurt because I feel like being naked and completely exposed like that is something more special to me and I know I would never do something like that. But on the other hand I totally get her view that there's nothing sexual about it and it's her body, just the thought made me uncomfortable.

However it is her choice. You can accept it, embrace it, or walk away.\n\nMy family is German and nudity is no big deal. In the US there is rampant puritanism, while women's bodies are exploited everywhere else. Men can be topless, but a woman breastfeeding is shameful. At the same token every popular tv show has naked bodies and sexual innuendos. I believe these events are meant to give women and men the sense of control over their bodies, their parts aren't just for sexual satisfaction.\n\nI wouldnt run naked 1. because I hate running and 2. too much bouncing is going to hurt. But I've been in plenty of situations where I was naked it public. Some places it is required, such as spas in Europe. No one had any adverse effects from this as far as I know.\n\nI am just sharing examples of how different people address this. I wont undermine your feelings and how important this is. That is your decision to set whatever expectations you want from your partner, it just may result in needing a new partner.", "Nah yet. You asked and she said no. That's it.  If you keep pushing, then you tip into ahole.  You can, of course, decide to break up with her bc of a mismatch in values. Naked may be special to you, but it isn't to her.", "NAH - yes she is the custodian of her own body and you also have a choice to continue the relationship. That\u2019s the way the real world works", "NAH. I think part of the naked run idea is the rejection that nudity is inherently sexual and not just the natural state. It's fine if you two disagree on this but I do think the intent is non sexual.", "NAH \u2014 for a more extreme example, there\u2019s nothing wrong with being a nudist, but there\u2019s also nothing wrong with not wanting to date a nudist. Sit with the feeling a while and see if it\u2019s something you can get over or not. Then you can decide whether to accept it, or whether you want to break up. The only thing you should NOT do is further try to convince her to change her mind, which will only drive conflict.", "NAH like others have said. At the end of the day, it\u2019s her choice to do what she wants, but I also 100% understand where you\u2019re coming from. I would have the exact same feelings as you do and this would absolutely be a deal breaker for me. At the same time, I don\u2019t really even want to be in a relationship with someone so willing to do this, so I\u2019d probably see it as a fortunate situation to be able to see such a massive clash of values after only 2 years (especially so young). \n\nOn top of this, you would not be the AH if you ended the relationship because of these actions. Just like she has the right to do the naked run, you have the right to decide that such a blatant disregard to something that\u2019s a core value for you will not work in your relationship. I don\u2019t suggest presenting this as an ultimatum as that will simply cause resentment, but anyone who tries to tell you that you\u2019re an AH for ending the relationship is just being biased towards the woman\u2019s side.", "NAH.\n\nYou can ask her not to do something that makes you uncomfortable.\n\nAnd she can choose to do it anyway.\n\nThis is a communication and values issue. If you can\u2019t resolve it, end the relationship.", "NAH -\n\nYou asked, she said no.  It\u2019s her body, and for many people this is totally fine.  But it\u2019s your choice as well, and for many others this would be uncomfortable and not for something somebody in a relationship does.\n\nI don\u2019t think your compatible", "You can be not ok with it  \n\n\nIt can be a deal breaker for you.  \n\n\nHowever if she wants to tough luck /shrug, other than expressing yourself not much you can do", "You asked, she said no. At this point NAH. If you keep pushing then YTA. People can have different views on things like this. You can't push your view on another though so have to decide if this difference is big enough for you or not.", "Y\u2019all aren\u2019t compatible", "NAH.\nAnd good on you for sharing your concerns. But, it's her body and she's entitled to make her own decisions. \nFor this issue, rest assured it really is completely nonsexual (running naked is way less sexy than you'd think!) But especially as a long-distance relationship you may need to think about how the differences in your outlooks should be communicated.", "You are not the asshole for feeling like this.\n\nBut it is her choice and you really don't get to say in the matter.", "Nah you  can feel uncomfortable and she can still do it.  You would be AH if you kept pushing it.", "No problem telling her. No problem if she does it anyway.", "Your views are different on this one thing. It\u2019s a major thing though in the long run. How many other views will cause friction. This is a major issues based on values. And will keep coming up in different forms in the future. Take it from me and find someone who better aligns with your core values. It will be less stressful for later.", "NAH.", "Nah.\n\nYou have a right to feel as you feel. But your girlfriend has a right to do what she wants with her own body.\n\n\nIf you don't like it and you cannot accept it you know where the door is\n\n\nIf you start trying to control her of what she can and cannot do you'll be an asshole", "NAH. It\u2019s her choice, whether you like it or not. But you\u2019re not being unreasonable to be upset about it.", "NAH. You can feel uncomfortable but that's where it ends I guess. If she wants to and has heard your POV, there's not much else to discuss.", "What the fuck kind of degenerate ritual is this?", "You can ask it, your assholitude depends on how you react to the answer.", "We have one of those runs in Michigan in Ann Arbor\u2026lots and lots of people participate!  I never have but chances of anyone noticing your gf are very very slim.  It\u2019s a very popular event.  I wouldn\u2019t worry.", "I've done one of those runs and it was just harmless fun, not sexual and also a pretty funny and memorable experience! Let her have some fun, you said your piece but she can still do it (and likely will do it)... learn to get past it...", "You should defer to what she wants to do. Your feelings are valid, though, and you should discuss them together. It sounds like you have different opinions about \"modesty\" and nudity. You should try to understand each other's perspective, but it is ultimately her choice to control who sees her body. Whether that rises to the level of \"deal-breaker\" or incompatibility will be a choice you make.", "I would say NAH, but college is a great time to really examine your world view.  Why is this important to you? Does it help you be who you want to be? Does it come from how you feel about yourself or how you feel about your girlfriend\u2019s body? \nSometimes when we self reflect, we end up in the same place we started, but we are still better for the reflection.", "*Asking*? NTA. Demanding, ordering, prohibiting? MASSIVE AH.\n\nYou've asked, she has (ideally) considered your position, and will decide accordingly. You can accept this decision. Or not.\n\nYou do understand that nudity does not equal sex, right? Ideally, sex includes nudity, but it is not necessary.", "NAH, but I don't think you guys are compatible. I wouldn't be okay with my SO doing this either. You're young, just break up and find someone else who has more similar values to you. You'll avoid a lot of wasted time, trust me.", "NAH the clear resolution to this is to run alongside her wearing her clothes over your clothes to give her the option to put them on if she wants. its probs gonna be cold out there", "NAH, just two different views that collided. If this is a dealbreaker for you, then perhaps you arent meant for each other", "We always give advice forgetting we are doing it from a perfect scenario. \n\nNAH. If she does it and you don\u2019t like it, move on. It\u2019s a boundary that isn\u2019t respected.", "This is one of those tests I guess. If it is that important to her, more important than your feelings or opinions on it, then maybe there is some incompatibility. \n\nYou are still young. As she has every right to do what she wants, you have every right to end it if you wish and find someone who shares your values or opinions.", "NAH lol\n\nYour allowed to not feel great about it, but shes allowed to tell you to grow tf up about it too.   \nContext matters, and even if you don't like the idea of it, it seems your feelings are based off the need to not want others to look at your GFs naked body sexually, which I absolutely assure you, already happens so often all the time whether she has clothes on or not. \n\nIt's a naked run with a literal naked crowd my guy. You should smoke a bowl or two, or an 8th first and go with her. It'll be a great experience for you both. Wear flesh colored spandex if it helps you feel better.", "NAH but you can become the AH of you keep pushing. She\u2019s right, but your feelings are also reasonable.", "NAH\n\nShe chose to do the run, you can choose to break up over this. I honestly am in your side in thinking it\u2019s inappropriate. Do with it what you think is best for you.", "you\u2019re not the asshole for feeling the way you do but you are an asshole for putting her in a position where she felt like she was responsible for the way you were feeling and you should apologize and tell her you realize that she is not responsible for your feelings and she is a grown woman who can make her own decisions", "Long-distance and in college? Wow this is a nuke just waiting to explode. NTA I'm sorry for you.", "Give the man a chance to feel his feelings holy shit. All of y\u2019all saying he\u2019s the asshole for being uncomfortable about something his partner is doing are insane. He\u2019s not forcing the issue as of right now, so he\u2019s not the asshole. If he does force it or holds a grudge then he would be. \n\nNot everyone\u2019s values are the same and that\u2019s ok and he\u2019s allowed to feel differently than his girlfriend. Neither of them are wrong and them being incompatible on nudity doesn\u2019t make either of then an asshole. If this is a dealbreaker for him, he\u2019s fully justified in breaking up with her. If he can get over it, good for him and I hope their relationship goes well. \n\nSince when are people assholes for asking something of their partner lol", "YTA. Its her call to do as she pleases. I live in Portland and we have monthly naked bike rides in the summer. They meet up at the park right by my house. I assure its not sexual. Further, nudity is not inherently sexual. Get over your hangups.", "NAH. But, OP, you REALLY need to get over your hangup. As a woman, my naked bits have been seen by SO MANY doctors and nurses over the years, it's almost ridiculous. And I haven't given birth.", "YTA. \n\nYou don't own her body and there's absolutely nothing sexual or intimate about naked runs. It's the same as being on the beach and taking your top off. No big deal. You sound possessive and jealous, which is a massive red flag.", "NTA\n\nYou either suck it up, or break up with her\u2026 you are most definitely not an AH for expecting that your gf won\u2019t get naked in front of other people", "NTA- sure it\u2019s her body but you have EVERY right to feel uncomfortable with this and in my opinion two people in a relationship should take into account the others feelings. If she decides to do it anyways I\u2019d break up", "Loosen up dude, it's just a body, everyone has a specimen", "You said it yourself, you view your bodies different and what you feel comfortable doing is going to be different. She\u2019s right, it\u2019s her body - you don\u2019t own it and can\u2019t tell her what to do with it. If this were about safety, that\u2019s one thing, but you\u2019re clearly more worried about people seeing her naked when \u201cthat\u2019s only supposed to be for you\u201d. Do you watch porn? If so, aren\u2019t all those women doing something wrong showing their bodies like that?", "NAH\u2026so far. You communicated your discomfort, she\u2019s declined to change her actions to accommodate, with reasons that are very good to her. You\u2019ve just got a run-of-the-mill values mismatch here. Now you have to decide how important that is to you. Maybe it\u2019s just the level of \u201cweird quirk my partner has\u201d and won\u2019t affect the relationship, or maybe it\u2019s a dealbreaker for you and it\u2019s time to end the relationship and look for someone who is a better match. If, instead, you try to force your opinion on her, then you would be T A", ">I know I would never do something like that.\n\nwell that's the thing though. You are not the one who will be doing that. This isn't about what you would or would not do about your body. You are trying to hold her to your rules/views, but she did not subscribe to that.\n\nThere is nothing wrong with feeling uncomfortable with her doing this, but you can\u00b4t tell her what to do, or pressure her to not do something when its her choice and body. You have voiced your opinion, she knows of it, now let it go of the matter.\n\nNAH", "Neither one of you is AH for having boundaries and views of your own. Communication is also great, talking about ones views and preferences etc is very important in a relationship.\n\nHowever, your gf also has every right to attend and \"show her body\" (which clearly isn't the purpose of this exercise) and her view is just as valid as yours. \n\nSounds like the occasion is important step and having such memories with friends etc. I would never miss something like that and asking for such would imo make you an AH, since it's just about your views why you don't want her to go. Just like she would be an AH if she tried to make you do the run too, respecting one and other is about accepting too.\n\nOnly thing you need to do is decide whether your relationship is going to work or not with such differences between you two or are these things too much for you.\n\nImo it's not a big thing, but I'm Finnish and most of us go to sauna naked with friends and family all the time. I'm very comfortable with it and I think there's lots of pros too for having such culture.", "No, you\u2019re NTA. Unfortunately, you both being 19 and your frontal cortex to your brains don\u2019t mature until the age of 25, those naked runs are going to be a mistake because what\u2019s going to happen is somebody is going to film; because that\u2019s what today\u2019s society has become and does. What\u2019s going to happen after is that film is going to make it online and your girlfriend will have to deal with the consequences of doing those things. She is basically going with the crowd mentality. You don\u2019t want to date somebody who just goes with what everybody else does. \n\nFind a girlfriend that thinks for herself and doesn\u2019t allow other peoples actions become hers. She\u2019s 19, but it\u2019s things like this that are eventually going to get her in big trouble. I\u2019m a 38 female and I can tell you that those naked runs get people into trouble without meaning to. It\u2019s a popular trend right now, but like many trends before it, it will fall out of popularity. Once it destroys other people\u2019s lives enough. \n\nGood luck to your girlfriend. Remember, you have a right to feel like as you feel and if she can\u2019t respect your opinion; then you\u2019re going to have to decide to either break it off or wait to see how it goes. You\u2019re 19, you\u2019re young. Relationships at 19 are so much different than they are when you\u2019re 25. \n\nDon\u2019t take life too serious when it comes to dating until later because you have time to find the right one. I would suggest a conservative girl. Because when you said you want somebody that sees their body more for intimacy, you pretty much just described a conservative girl. See how this goes, but also be aware that this is also a longlong-distance, there is a chance that she ends up cheating as well because not many young long relationships work out. I\u2019m just going by what I know from experience when I attended college back in 2004. Maybe I\u2019m complete wrong but, long distance relationships from what I\u2019ve seen my friends go through; it never worked out, unless both the people in the relationship were on the same page. Good luck to you, and I hope it works out. Just tell her how you feel and have a real discussion about it then you\u2019ll know if this relationship is going to work out or not.", "Lol yes get over yourself her body is not your property she can do what she wants", "I\u2019m sorry, is it your naked body? No? Then Stfu! Because you will be uncomfortable that others will see her naked? Grow up. It\u2019s not your body. YTA!!!!!", "NTA, you can express your discomfort and she can choose how/if she deals with that. You can't control what she does but you can express your views.", "NTA. This is a test of your relationship. Either you accept her decision if you think you can deal with it, or if it\u2019s really important to you and she still wants to go ahead just break up with her. Neither of you are AH because of your conflicting views, but it can understandably be a dealbreaker if you both feel strongly about your positions.", "YTA. Just because you're insecure doesn't mean your partner should be as well. Break up with her so she can be with someone who doesn't whine about shit that doesn't matter.", "NTH but if her views on things like that are vastly different than yours...I'd probably cut my losses now. You're still very young and it could just be immaturity and her views may change...but they also may become a lot more \"free\". You seem to have a good head on your shoulders and are a lot more reserved than she is. What if she goes to college or university and continues this same line of thinking etc.", "She is right that it is her body, her choice. What she isn't understanding is that every choice made has a consequence. Whether the consequences be good or bad depend on the choice being made. Her choice here will affect you negatively. Therefore, the consequences of her choice in this scenario are unfavorable to you. \n\nYou are allowed to not agree with her choices. While each of us are free to make our choices, we are not free of the consequences from said choices. If you make bad choices that don't sit right with her. They would be damaging to the relationship. Why, because your choices will affect how she looks and feels towards you. The same things apply to her. If she makes poor choices that don't sit right with you, it will affect how you look and feel towards her. \n\nIf someone is so quick to dismiss their partners feelings when things will affect the relationship, then that person is not the person for them.  \n\nNTA", "YTA if you press/force/blackmail her to change her mind.", "Read the title and said to myself \u201che better be talking about dark souls\u201d", "NTA, you two have a major difference here (IMHO).  Seriously, I can see where this could be a problem in the future.  You should both sit down with someone you both respect and discuss it, come to an agreement, or don't and know its going to cause problems later.\n\n  Neither of you are wrong, its about your own personalities, wants, likes/dislikes.  Nothing wrong with being modest about this, nothing wrong with being open about this. \n\n   Personally, I know that I would not have my wife do it, especially in this time of videos and the internet everywhere.  I would die of cringe if my wife was seen naked by my boss, close friend, neighborhood prevert, etc....  \n\n   I am not saying this is sexual, I am saying that I could not handle the local prevert knowing what she looks like.   In my neighborhood, we have 2 prevs, 1 a public masturbater (he does it under a towel, so the sherriff won't do much) and the other takes pictures of all the females, like constantly.  That is where I am coming from.", "YTA be proud that your girlfriend has confidence in her own body, stop being prudish. you were born naked as (Insert what god you believe in) intended . A wise reporter once said of staying at a nudist colony for a week, the only sexual thing he saw during the entire stay was when he went to a supermarket and there was a nicely dressed woman. its what we cant see that drives urges. when its all hanging out it you find there is nothing sexual about a naked body.", "NTA. You're uncomfortable and told her. And you're well reason even if you view this as a deal-breaker. \n\nShe's coming across as the AH though if she just gets pissed and told you it didn't matter. She's ignoring your feelings and hurting the relationship seemingly without a good reason to participate in the naked run outside of nudity is not sexual.", "NTA - mostly because she got pissed about a very reasonable boundary. She doesn't have to agree with you, but getting angry about it is uncalled for.\n\n\n\nBut seriously, break up. You're long distance, you have different values, and she yells at you for viewing public nudity as sexual/intimate. This is the prime season to find a matching partner. Don't waste it on a ending relationship", "YTA its her body its her choice.\n\nIts up to you whether you continue the relationship, but thats a you issue, not a her issue.\n\nYou dont get to tell her what to do, ever. you get to decide if you are comfortable being in a relationship with her and how she acts, but you dont get to dictate how she acts.\n\nIf you were just unhappy about it, but respected her choice, then not an asshole, but as you clearly have made a big deal of it and tried to guilt her into altering her behaviour, YTA.\n\nHonestly if I were her I'd end the relationship right here. I'd not want to be in a relationship with someone so prudish and controlling. Its such a minor issues, its just being naked, its not a big deal.", "YTA if you keep pushing the issue.

Bodies are not meant just for you to view just because you\u2019re in a intimate relationship with someone.

Unless you guys have an open relationship then that\u2019s a different beast. \n\nBut your girlfriend going to nude beach, doing a naked run, wearing revealing clothing, going topless in places that allow it\u2026 Those are not invalidating your monogamy.

Listen, I get that it's weird to most of us.  But here's the thing:  It shouldn't be.  Nudity *should* be a perfectly normal thing in human society.  We've been conditioned to not find it acceptable.  But there's no logic in that.\n\nWe're the only animal on the planet Earth that deals with this issue.  It's stupid.

You wouldn't be \"in the wrong\" if you broke up with her over because this goes too far for you; that's *your* boundary to set.\n\nThe important thing is that you don't force your own convictions and boundaries on your partner, which it seems like you're not doing at all.

Long distance periods in a relationship shouldn't last more than 6 months and they certainly shouldn't last longer than the amount of time that you've dated in person.

When you finish your undergrad you will be looking at grad school and employment opportunities which means that you won't be prioritizing closing the distance any time soon. During a long distance period you're not really in a relationship. Instead, you are both putting your romantic lives on hold until you move to the same city. This means that you are both living as aromantic single people for years and years. \n\nThis is just foolish. While at university you are surrounded by available, interesting, ambitious, age appropriate people. You will never again have a more extensive dating pool. This is a unique time in your lives. Don't sacrifice all of these experiences and opportunities in exchange for text messages, calls, and video chats. This isn't bringing joy, growth or fulfillment to your life. Instead your adding anxiety, angst, and obligation with very little if any reward at all. \n\nAre you ever going to close the distance? If you do, how many years will it be before that happens? When you finally do close the distance, you won't be the same person that you were at 17 and neither will she. You may no longer be compatible at all.

If you have a boundary state clearly that I not 100% not ok and that is a hard boundary for me.

If your partner becomes an addict and refuses to go to rehab do you just pack up and leave? You don't tell them you expect that they go to rehab or you break up? Would that be manipulative?\n\nAlso, as I've already asked somewhere (don't know if it's in this thread), how in hell was this guy supposed to know before the relationship that his girlfriend is ok with being naked in front of everyone?", "Ok..as you wish to put it. How is yours better? Either way, they get to choose if what they are about to do is more important to them than the relationship.", "But wait..even in the case of drug use it's still their body. You don't own it. So why is it ok to draw the line there but not here? And not all drugs make people violent. Why is it ok to use a breakup threat when it comes to drug use but not here? How is a breakup threat manipulative?", "And the other 99% of the beach-goers? Were you wanting to bang them too?", "Your first comment I replied to. Made it clear you are a pervert.   The second one I replied to made it clear you're insecure.    Also your comment saying people on Reddit overuse it really implies I'm not the first person to call you insecure.    In conclusion you are insecure.      Understand?", "Then that person values the relationship and not you. If you are willing to disregard how I feel once I told you then you\u2019re hurting me. If your now willing to not do it to save the relationship then you care about yourself. If you hurt the relationship you not onli hurt me but you hurt yourself. I\u2019d rather you not do it just cause it hurts me.", "Thank you! People here, and all over the internet tbh, have a very twisted idea of what boundaries are", "Just had my 40th birthday and honestly no. They don't become fuzzier. I have way clearer view on my dealbreakers then 20 years ago and don't have time to waste for incomatible connections. She shouldn't agree to adjust her boundaries. People shouldn't give up on themselves to fit in to unfitting relationship. If it's important enough to be a dealbreaker let it break the deal. He already explained it's important to him, she already explained it's important to her.", "No one is communicating 'I'm leaving' other is communicating 'change or I'll leave'. Idk how to make that clearer.\n\nOf course everyone changes in relationship. But not about core values. This iscore value for OP and not for partner. You don't want to create relationship with someone with opposite core values, it will be bad relationship. 'While I'm also happy' is the point. OP already explained they won't be happy if partner does it. Partner already explainwd they wont be happy submitting to OPs standards.", "I'm sorry you cannot see the difference. 'I'm leaving, goodbye, here's explanation why' is the same to you as 'change or I'll leave'? In first case I'll leave whatever you say cause decission is already made.\n\nEdit typo", "The comment I was initially replying to used the word threat first, hence why I was discussing it. At least check the thread before commenting \ud83d\udc80", "I would honestly stop responding if i were you, people here giving this kind of advice are either not or never have been in relationships using buzzwords they use on the internet or they are in a relationship you wouldnt want to be in anyway. \n\nNo one in a real relationship is going to do what these other commenters did as its ridiculous to suggest people just leave at the first spot of difference.", "You lost me at comparing a harmless naked run vs an addict that is actively destroying their life and refuses help. They aren\u2019t the same man. Even more, one was probably a one time thing vs a daily problem that may go on for years and years. \nYes. Some things will deserve ultimatums. But probably not nudie run.", "Because it's destructive, and a naked run is actually good for you.", "No, but they weren\u2019t averting their eyes from the couples banging just a few feet away.  I cannot believe there are people so naive as to think there is *zero* sexual motivation behind getting naked in public.  Do you just believe anything anybody tells you, no matter how ridiculous it sounds?", "Getting naked in public *is* inherently sexual, it\u2019s called exhibitionism.  You can deny that all you\u2019d like but you\u2019re just factually incorrect.  Additionally, calling someone insecure doesn\u2019t prove anything, it\u2019s just name calling in an attempt to shut down the discussion because you don\u2019t like what is being said."]}
