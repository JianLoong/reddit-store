{"id": 23389, "submission_id": "15cnbe6", "title": "AITA for getting upset with my fiance over his girl best friend affecting our wedding plans?", "selftext": "My fiance and I are getting married next year. I've had my eyes set on an extremely competitive venue in October. There is only 1 available day for us that works for my family, and it happens to fall on his \u2018girl best friend\u2019s birthday. There are several reasons as to why I\u2019m dead set on October. I have always dreamed of a fall wedding, September is difficult for me because it is when my brother passed, and November doesn\u2019t really work with our family\u2019s travel schedules.\n\n\r  \nMy issue is more with how my fiance approached the issue of his friends birthday and the potential wedding date overlapping rather than him not wanting those on the same day. Instead of asking me if there is any way we can compromise (which, really there isn't but I\u2019d appreciate that thought), he went off on me saying that it\u2019s Veronica's birthday and \u201cI know that.\u201d and that I \u201ccan't be upset\u201d when he puts off celebrating our anniversary for her birthday. It felt like he was accusing me of purposefully plotting to \u2026 stop them from celebrating together?\n\n\r  \nThis died down a bit and then when I was talking about the guest meals. I spoke with the planner and she suggested that, to help with costs, the bride and groom will be served fish (I am pescatarian), along with select family members who are pescatarian, and everyone else will be served chicken. I have all the fish eaters together so people don\u2019t feel confused or offended by them being offered different, somewhat cheaper food. He then argued with me that Veronica loves fish, and I should put her down for fish as well. I told him I didn\u2019t want guests to be upset at her getting fish while sitting with other guests and them not having the option. If it was dietary it would be different, but he says no, Veronica is a picky eater and that's essentially the same as not eating chicken by choice for health/ethic reasons.\n\n\r  \nIt felt like I was walking on eggshells as we kept getting into fights about Veronica and our wedding. He told me that he was talking about our cake in a group chat of his and she wanted him to suggest a different flavor combo to me since she said a wedding she went to prior had the same and she did not like it.\n\n\r  \nI flipped out for once and just screamed that it\u2019s OUR, MY, wedding- me and him, NOT hers. It's okay to have opinions but hers literally do not matter this one singular time. He told me I was out of line and had a clear dislike for Veronica despite her trying to be helpful and I am bitter of their friendship. He left and hasn\u2019t told me where he is staying, and he won\u2019t be coming home until I admit fault and promise to be \u201cmore accepting\u201d of his female friend(s). I honestly try my best to be nice despite how rudely she treats me. She basically flat out ignores me. Our friends seem to not want to get involved. I expected them to have my back and now I'm questioning if I'm crazy (and an Ahole).", "created_utc": 1690620722, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15cnbe6/aita_for_getting_upset_with_my_fiance_over_his/", "score": 4330, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It is sucky to decide to serve one meal to your own family and a different meal to everyone else in attendance at your wedding.*\n\nThe birthday thing is kind of dumb IMHO. Most people pick an adjacent weekend to celebrate their birthday whereas most couples celebrate their anniversary on the actual day. So it's very possible there won't be a conflict most years. If there is though, most adults are aware that other people can't drop everything else going on in their lives for someone's birthday party. *Edit: so this is an example of Veronica and the fiance sucking, because once you're an adult you should realize your birthday party does not need to happen on your exact birthday and that some people won't be able to attend every year.

So that means... every year you want him to celebrate his wedding anniversary on her birthday. You are not doing yourself, or your relationship any favours making him choose between the two obligations.\n\nI think if you want this relationship to work, you or your fiance need to suggest pushing the wedding back by a year (in 2025 if you are set on that venue) or pick a different day next calendar year (in September or at a different venue). It will give you guys as a couple time to do multiple things:\n\n1. Have couple's counselling to work through your communication issues, and work on compromises\n2. Pick a different date in the fall for next year, if you choose her birthday the next year for the wedding, this really is a YTA solely case\n3. Save up enough money so that you can let your guests pick if they want chicken or fish (forcibly assigning people chicken or fish at a wedding and then assigning their seating based on this is bizarre and comes across as extremely cheap tbh)\n4. If need be, revisit the cake option. Based on my reading your fiance's friend was not telling you to pick a specific cake, but was warning the one you chose would not taste good. Not sure if she is saying this because the cake combo you picked is bad, or your fiance will not enjoy the wedding cake flavour on his own wedding day. Either way, my point is stop cutting your fiance out of the wedding planning process, he literally made a cake group chat because he is interested in this.\n\nGood luck OP.

He stood in their wedding. But if something needed fixing in her house, he made the hour trip to her home to fix it. If there was a party at her house, he drove the hour to be there no matter what I wanted. They called daily. She had a husband but used my boyfriend for the emotional aspect of a relationship since her husband wasn\u2019t very romantic or emotionally intelligent. She slept with her husband but all other aspects of a relationship- that was my boyfriend. Cuddles on the couch, complaining about her husband and life worries, if her car broke down, she called him, I could go on.\n\nWe would get into arguments, (which we never fought about anything else, ever.

We spent nights together and went places together but it\u2019s like he never considered my feelings. If he was at the store, he would see chips she liked and grab her a bag, to bring next time she needed help. But he never brought me home a bag of chips or chocolate bar. Like he knew how to be thoughtful but didn\u2019t feel like he needed to be with me. \n\nBackstory, the fbf was his best friends girlfriend. His best friend committed unaliveing and he felt they were the only two who understood each other and helped each other through that time. It\u2019s why I was willing to put up with so much. Maybe I was misreading things. Maybe this *is* just a close friendship. Aren\u2019t I like this with my female friends? Well, fbf eventually found a boyfriend, got married, had a kid and there was my boyfriend. I was the first girl he had dated since his friend died.

However, I have a feeling based on her fianc\u00e9s response to everything including the cake, that OP is less willing to accommodate Veronica than anyone else because she is well aware that her fianc\u00e9 is secretly in love with her and puts Veronica before her all of the time.", "Such a dumb comment.

SMH", "I\u2019m an ESH on this one, though I actually thought the cake flavor thing was the weirdest thing for OP to be mad about. The wedding date I can kind of understand. I do think the wedding date should be more important that the friend\u2019s birthday, but the reasons for not doing it in November were a little off to me. I get that it might not jive with vacation plans, but the wedding is over a year away, so there\u2019s plenty of time of change vacation plans. And that will be one vacation; they don\u2019t \u201cneed\u201d to happen at the same time every year like an anniversary/birthday. That being said, Veronica is a grown ass adult, so by now she should be able to handle the possibility of celebrating her birthday with that particular friend at some other time than her actual birth date. \n\nOn the food thing, it\u2019s odd to me that she\u2019s trying to hide the fish option from everyone. I thought it was standard to decide on the options and make them available to everyone rather than trying to hide options for budgetary reasons. Still, the guests are probably going to catch on when they\u2019re at the wedding that there was a fish option they didn\u2019t get, whether or not Veronica is eating it because other people are. They can still see the people eating their fish and if it\u2019s like most weddings they may even get up to talk to other people during dinner and therefore notice some people have fish, so I don\u2019t think keeping the fish from Veronica is going to prevent all possibility of this \u201csecret\u201d getting out.\n\nI do think she missed an obvious possibility which is that her fianc\u00e9 wants to sit closer to his best friend since OP is organizing by food preference (which is also weird). If OP is freaking out about other people seeing Veronica eating fish while they\u2019re eating chicken, then she can just sit Veronica with the fish eaters like her and her fianc\u00e9. Unless she thinks that somewhere over dinner at their very wedding the fianc\u00e9\u2019s going to suddenly realize he was wrong this whole time, grab V\u2019s hand and sprint for the nearest place offering birthday cake.\n\nBut the cake flavor thing could have been as simple as Veronica having tried a the moser unusual combo, like chocolate chai cake, and thinking it didn\u2019t really work. From OP\u2019s post, she flipped out that Veronica even wanted to suggest another cake flavor combination. Like dude relax! You get to taste your cakes and decide if you do in fact love the chocolate chai, all she\u2019s saying is she tried it and didn\u2019t like it so maybe you should try some other combos. If one of OP\u2019s own friends had mentioned they didn\u2019t like the combo, would she have jettisoned them from her life?\n\nShe says Veronica just ignores her but frankly this post gives vibes that she\u2019s always been uneasy about her fianc\u00e9s friendship with a woman. If she\u2019s been this way the whole time, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s weird that Veronica has given up on trying to be friends and just accepts that she\u2019s her best friends girl and so treats her like any acquaintance she might know.", "THANK YOU FOR A VOICE OF REASONING!! \n\nI take this sub at face value, it\u2019s Reddit ffs..\ud83d\ude44\nBut if OP is going to make life changing decisions based on reddit AITA , then she gets what she deserves !", "That was an interesting contrarian take!

OP\u2019s fianc\u00e9e is sketch but Veronica could have just mentioned having had that same cake flavor before without trying to influence the fianc\u00e9e. The point is, we only get filtered info on her via the fianc\u00e9e, filtered again by OP who clearly doesn\u2019t like her (understandable). But mostly the fianc\u00e9e sucks if OP is to be believed.\n\nI like the hypothesis fianc\u00e9e might be trying to put his preferences down via Veronica, and that this isn\u2019t about her at all. I hadn\u2019t thought of that but OP does seem quite self-centered from that perspective.\n\nAnyway, regardless I agree with everyone that this ain\u2019t a marriage material relationship.

She had one meal for the vegan and like two others for any surprise vegetarians that asked. It was not as a meal choice, though. It would make the chicken cost more if she allowed people to pick pasta or chicken, negating any savings from the 'cheaper' pasta being on the menu. She was already completely maxxed on budget. Less plates means more per person. She'd drop under the 50/60/ 75 price cutoff if she started ordering two types of meals.\n\nThere were *exactly* three meals for non-meat eaters. That was not for 'mm. You know, I'm not a huge fan of chicken.' It was because she wasn't asking her bridesmaid to pack a dinner or eat only salad and side veggies and some bread. She flatly did not have the budget for every food preference to be accounted for. They just had three pre-made pasta plates for anyone who could not have chicken. There wasn't actually a choice. It was purely a budget thing, and had there not been a vegan bridesmaid and no vegan/ vegetarian family, she'd of probably not any any option and any surprise vegetarians would have sides. She just didn't have more money for catering.\n\nOnce you start adding more and more people for special meals, your costs go up.

Also run far away as fast as you can it will be cheaper than a divorce down the line.", "I won't assume he's with Veronica, he could be. I can see him being in his childhood room with at parents' home. That said 100% agree with all other aspects of this comment.", "She probably loves having his full attention and gets a thrill when he chooses her over his fianc\u00e9. Some girls crave  attention like that. I also would bet  he over shares with bff and not in a flattering way to his own fianc\u00e9.", "This right here! She likes him enough to have him cater to her like a boyfriend would, but not enough to be with him. OP, you\u2019re not crazy and you deserve better. Dump him, find a real man who loves and cherishes you, and plan an October wedding years later when you find the right person! If you go through with this, I foresee miserable years of him prioritizing Veronica over you, don\u2019t waste these years of your life. You are not crazy, you deserve better, and 100% NTA!", "I guarantee he is staying with her!!", "Ikr they're probably talking so much trash on OP if they're not fucking each other right now.", "What the hell is this based on? We know absolutely nothing about her from this post.", "Dunno, sounds like Veronica doesn't have to do much to always be on the fiance's mind. The only thing she actually caused in the post was the thing about the cake flavor, which could have been a normal-if-tactless thing to say: \"Oh, your thinking of that? I just had it and I thought the flavor combination didn't work well at all.\" If the fiance's reaction wasn't VERONICA SAID THEREFORE MUST DO it would have been a non-event. The problem is that he is so dialed in to EVERYTHING as it relates to her -- the date, her likes and dislikes, everything makes him think about her FIRST. I feel so bad for OP to have gotten this far into the relationship with this man.", "Its so awful when that happens. It instantly changes everything for me. I let every single one of those \u201cfriendships\u201d go. I guess they had the right to shoot their shot, but I don\u2019t lead my friends on or flirt or send ambiguous vibes.

Like I am still friends with an ex of mine, but that was because it ebcame clear that we are better off as friends then anything else.\n\nIn this case though, yeah, it's absolutely nuts how much OPs bf is focusing on the friend over such inane prattle, there's definitely far more going on and she probly should cut and run, this nonsense ain't worth it.", "Been with my husband for 38 years. Still madly in love. Agree 100%.", "I\u2019d take my chances on losing the friendship. I couldn\u2019t sit by idly.", "Totally agree.

OP is NTA but she needs to reevaluate the relationship.", "It's not looking for a fix. Feeling the need to block someone just because you don't have anything specific to say to them is a very unhealthy product of modern society.", "That's what I thought, too. They know more about this than OP knows. This isn't just a normal friendship.", "Yeah I agree. I think they both need to step back and re-evaluate their relationship. It doesn\u2019t sound healthy. That being said, he was fine with no September and no November, so it sounds like he will compromise, but she won\u2019t compromise on that one date.", "Either this guy has a thing for highly controlling women in his life or he doesn\u2019t want to be the source of confrontation with his bride and is using his friend as cover for his objections\u2026", "100%", "I definitely agree on the other points. The whole Veronica thing really overshadowed those other issues for me lol", "No, that's not what I'm saying. He definitely sucks. I don't think OP is to blame for *his* suckiness. She should dump him. But the meal thing does suggest that she has her own brand of suckiness too. It really is a sucky attitude to decide to serve one meal to your family and a different meal to everyone else in attendance at your wedding.", "I totally agree with you! The whole thing is ridiculous in my opinion and while it is an extreme suggestion but I think OP should just cancel everything and break up with him as her fiance cannot see what he did wrong and will keep on putting her last in everything when they haven\u2019t even gotten married yet!", "Thank you for the insight! Never thought of it that way. I come from a culture where 95% of the time we serve our famous national dish in weddings because the great majority of guests love it. And we tend to go extra hospitable in weddings and invite +200 people and usually more come so more food is made in advance to accommodate those extra guests(I consider it a bad and good thing at the same time in my opinion because so much money is spent in the name of hospitality). When my uncle got married he decided to go out of the norm and make a small wedding in a hotel with an open buffet but some guests wanted more than what it was arranged for them and he had to pay more so I agree with you on that one as it is very annoying.", "Weddings are expensive.  Divorces are usually even more costly.  Cut and run while the cost is nominal.  I suspect he\u2019s setting you up to take the blame for breaking up, which considering the circumstances, is an OK consequence.", "I imagine this little-finger wrapped asshat to insist that their first girl be named Veronica, and if it\u2019s a boy, after her father. \n\nOP is getting a heads up about what her marriage will be like, and it will get worse. She should use this knowledge. Sure, she might lose money on wedding things that can\u2019t be refunded, but it\u2019ll probably be far less than the lawyer, and losing several more years to this guy.", "There is something, probably unrequited but she still enjoys holding the puppets strings", "This is a good question, I have 2-3 male friends I get to see ~maybe~ once a year and honestly I shower them with love and appreciation with my words. They\u2019re all childhood friends I\u2019ve known since we were all 8-10. And personally I never felt any tension between us and they all have girlfriends. I love their girlfriends. I love my guy friends! I\u2019ve never had any issues with them. But it\u2019s also not like I talk to them so much or give this kind of input. On birthdays or special occasions I always shoot a nice message saying how I have love for them in my heart (not the words I love you so and so) and that they\u2019re wonderful and keep doing great. My boyfriend\u2019s have never minded and my friends have never said anything to me about their girls and their girls have always made me feel welcome and appreciated too. \n\nSo I get frustrated for others when I read these things because there are some really whole, life long friendships but people take advantage of the concept and their loved ones.", "He is definitely having at least an emotional affair with Veronica if not a physical one.

He's the middling size, decent enough fish and she's keeping him on the stringer while she continues to cast for the 'catch of the day'.

You expect a few to not show, but never extras to show up.\n\nIf she had less of one type of food, the cost per person goes up. Like, you have a price for under 20 people, 20-50 costs one amount, 50-74 costs one price, 75+ costs another, etc. So by offering more types of the main dish, you will spend a lot more money.\n\nBy limiting the extra plates for a handful of people the caterer didn't do the normal pricing for those plates. There wasn't really an option for guests to pick from chicken or pasta. It was that one specific person was vegan.", "This is exactly it. My ex husband used to strike up friendships with other women with the express purpose of establishing blurry boundaries and leading them on, and then would spin it to get me upset that X called him 25 times today or Y sent provocative photos. He literally fed off of watching me get mad and jealous. He sucked so hard.", "Bashing OP to Veronica could also be why Veronica is an AH to her -- she thinks OP is a toxic nightmare because fiance constantly tells her so.", "He also gets the fun high of watching two women fight over him.  Veronica may not want him when he's single, but he can watch him demand his attention and fight for his regard when he's with someone.  He knows if he was single she wouldn't push for so much of his time.", "He will 10/10 discuss every facet of their marriage, just like he\u2019s sharing already. \n\nOP needs to leave them to it.", "Exactly.

He could never admit when he was wrong and neither could Rachel for many of the same reasons but out of the two she at least had a little growth.", "I think Ross is worse because he was equally unbearable and jealous both when they were and weren't together.

They deserve each other.", "HE WAS ON A BREAK", "I was that fish once and it sucked when I finally realized it.", "I wouldn't want to have my wedding on my best friends birthday and if I noticed there was food he didn't usually eat and food he did id probably ask to move him to that meal too. I really don't think that's that weird, the cake is where it got weird for me.", "This is what I was thinking.  My best friends and I text each other at most, and it's pretty spotty, I'll forget much of the time.  I couldn't give a shit whether they like the food I'm serving and neither would they, you can eat a sandwich first if you don't think you'll like dinner.

Food certainly isn't. Date... may not be?\n\nLike if Veronica and Fianc\u00e9 are basically siblings, I don't know that anyone would be saying it's an asshole move to be upset about a wedding on your sister's birthday. Other stuff in there (like the cake thing) are for sure a huge problem, though.", "I mean, I don't *agree* but yes, I follow you. I think any gender having a best friend who doesn't like their partner and causes problems isn't all that rare. \n\nAs I said in my main response, OP's NTA for basically all of it, though some stuff (like the fish thing) feels fully punitive and assholish. These guys need therapy to work it out or walk away.", "So a bisexual person, in your opinion, shouldn't hang out with anyone alone if they're in a relationship because there's potential for interest?

I agree with this take.\n\nI'd like to know if she's in the wedding party.  Usually those are the people, along with your parents, grandparents and any siblings who aren't in the party that you ask for the dates that aren't good for them before locking it in.  She isn't just a distant cousin, casual friend, co-worker or a parent's friend, so her attendance is mandatory for him.  She's one of his core people.\n\nThat being said, considering the difficulty with the hall, she can survive celebrating her birthday earlier or later one year (and him not being there, as he'll be busy before the wedding and probably on his honeymoon afterwards).  The cake thing is also ridiculous.\n\nThe one thing I'm not with OP on is the meal.  Every wedding I've ever attended allowed the guests to choose from three main course options along with their response to the invitation.  I've never heard of it being pre-chosen for the guests.  It also sounds like she thinks sitting the fish option people together is going to hide it from the chicken option guests.  That's a bit absurd.  Of course the closest tables to them are going to notice and word is going to spread.\n\nThat's not something you save money on.  If you can't afford presenting people options and many possibly choosing the most expensive, then cut down your list further, cut from something else or wait until you have the funds.", "Even the cake isn\u2019t weird, saying \u201chey I had this recently and it tasted bad\u201d is something any friends would/should say.\n\nAt my brothers wedding there was 2 options for dinner you could choose from, OP could do the same but suggest there\u2019s an extra cost associated with fish. Tbh tho most people would choose chicken over fish anyways.\n\nThe anniversary delay was the weird part. Lots of birthdays are celebrated the weekend after, anniversaries often aren\u2019t. Also his ditching the anniversary to celebrate her birthday is weird and the definite \u201cthere\u2019s something going on\u201d red flag.", "So? She never slept with him. Either Ross trusted Rachel to be faithful or he didn\u2019t - And he clearly didn\u2019t!", "Id probably tell her about the conflict and remind her that we tend to do something every year as our friend group doesn't get to see each other often, and ask if we could do a different weekend around that time. If she was as uncompromising as OP, I wouldn't be marrying her in the first place.\n\nOP is still NTA (from what we see, at least) because the cake comment was weird and storming off and demanding an apology is gross, but she def doesn't come off as an angel to me either.", "The anniversary delay thing is certainly weird. I could see someone saying \"well if you're not willing to move the date, don't be surprised if it impacts future plans\" but that's still pretty shitty to say to your spouse. At the end of the day though, neither of the people in this story are giving me any sense that they belong in a relationship.", "I'm picturing chocolate and orange and OP not knowing how controversial a flavor combo it is or something. We don't really know, but it's possible it played out the way you said.\n\nIf it was, \"let's change our cake because Friend doesn't like it,\" that would be weird.", "Venues aren\u2019t always available on other weekends, so it\u2019s not necessarily that OP I being uncompromising on timing.  As for the anniversaries, you can celebrate them before or after the friend meetup, although it\u2019s unusual for big annual friend meetups to continue consistently after 30 or so.", "Exactly, done tactfully that could be worded better to suggest that there may be times you celebrate with the friend and do a bigger weekend anniversary celebration. But there\u2019s too much emotion, not enough communication, and too many people(3) in this relationship."]}
