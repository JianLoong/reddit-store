{"id": 23389, "submission_id": "15cnbe6", "title": "AITA for getting upset with my fiance over his girl best friend affecting our wedding plans?", "selftext": "My fiance and I are getting married next year. I've had my eyes set on an extremely competitive venue in October. There is only 1 available day for us that works for my family, and it happens to fall on his \u2018girl best friend\u2019s birthday. There are several reasons as to why I\u2019m dead set on October. I have always dreamed of a fall wedding, September is difficult for me because it is when my brother passed, and November doesn\u2019t really work with our family\u2019s travel schedules.\n\n\r  \nMy issue is more with how my fiance approached the issue of his friends birthday and the potential wedding date overlapping rather than him not wanting those on the same day. Instead of asking me if there is any way we can compromise (which, really there isn't but I\u2019d appreciate that thought), he went off on me saying that it\u2019s Veronica's birthday and \u201cI know that.\u201d and that I \u201ccan't be upset\u201d when he puts off celebrating our anniversary for her birthday. It felt like he was accusing me of purposefully plotting to \u2026 stop them from celebrating together?\n\n\r  \nThis died down a bit and then when I was talking about the guest meals. I spoke with the planner and she suggested that, to help with costs, the bride and groom will be served fish (I am pescatarian), along with select family members who are pescatarian, and everyone else will be served chicken. I have all the fish eaters together so people don\u2019t feel confused or offended by them being offered different, somewhat cheaper food. He then argued with me that Veronica loves fish, and I should put her down for fish as well. I told him I didn\u2019t want guests to be upset at her getting fish while sitting with other guests and them not having the option. If it was dietary it would be different, but he says no, Veronica is a picky eater and that's essentially the same as not eating chicken by choice for health/ethic reasons.\n\n\r  \nIt felt like I was walking on eggshells as we kept getting into fights about Veronica and our wedding. He told me that he was talking about our cake in a group chat of his and she wanted him to suggest a different flavor combo to me since she said a wedding she went to prior had the same and she did not like it.\n\n\r  \nI flipped out for once and just screamed that it\u2019s OUR, MY, wedding- me and him, NOT hers. It's okay to have opinions but hers literally do not matter this one singular time. He told me I was out of line and had a clear dislike for Veronica despite her trying to be helpful and I am bitter of their friendship. He left and hasn\u2019t told me where he is staying, and he won\u2019t be coming home until I admit fault and promise to be \u201cmore accepting\u201d of his female friend(s). I honestly try my best to be nice despite how rudely she treats me. She basically flat out ignores me. Our friends seem to not want to get involved. I expected them to have my back and now I'm questioning if I'm crazy (and an Ahole).", "created_utc": 1690620722, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15cnbe6/aita_for_getting_upset_with_my_fiance_over_his/", "score": 1510, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Platonic friendships between men and women do exist. And if they\u2019re best friends it makes sense that he wants to be hospitable towards her. And remember it\u2019s not just YOUR wedding, it\u2019s also HIS. So if he wants things a certain way you should at least try to compromise.

You picked the one date that would make him have to choose yearly between you and his friend. You lost it when he suggested to give her fish. You could have just had an rsvp card where everyone could choose fish, but you decided your way was the only way. Plus your arbitrary rule of placing pescatarians together meant that you could place his friend away from him. \n\nThe only thing the friend has done wrong is to suggest another cake flavor.

I tried to get over it because I trusted him but it was driving me CRAZY. Eventually I told him if this was how things were going to be then I couldn\u2019t be in a relationship where I felt like this. And he immediately broke down and asked me what he needed to do not to lose me. He sat down once with her to explain why then essentially cut off all contact with her. We\u2019ve been married a decade now and they stay in touch like once a year which I\u2019m completely okay with it.\n\nThe bottom line is THAT is how your fianc\u00e9 should react. You\u2019re essentially the other woman here, you\u2019re not his priority and you never will be and if you actually marry him you need to accept that. Hopefully, you don\u2019t and you won\u2019t.

Birthdays and anniversaries in my opinion don\u2019t have to be celebrated all day long. He can manage to divide his day into two parts for both celebrations if he really cares for both, or find any other way since it is possible and not that hard. However he already decided as it appears that he is putting Veronica\u2019s birthday over the anniversary instead of compromising which is what upset OP. Now imagine if his or her parents or siblings or any other best friends birthday fell on the same day as their wedding, should they postpone it? That is just so ridiculous in my opinion because if you care you would do anything for your loved ones regardless but it seriously seems that there is something wrong with the fiance and V\u2019s relationship.\nBut I agree with you on the fish part because food is a preference and guests should be comfortable and get what they like.", "I agree with you about some of this, so I vote ESH. \n\nIf they are offering two meal options they should give each person to tick a box next to the meal they want on the RSVP card. I think most people will wind up choosing chicken anyway so I don't think the expense would be that crazy. But their approach isn't good. People say you can do whatever you want for your own wedding, but honestly doing stuff like this is still gouche. \n\nThe birthday thing is kind of dumb IMHO. Most people pick an adjacent weekend to celebrate their birthday whereas most couples celebrate their anniversary on the actual day. So it's very possible there won't be a conflict most years. If there is though, most adults are aware that other people can't drop everything else going on in their lives for someone's birthday party.", "I agree 100%.
