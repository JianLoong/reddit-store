{"id": 23389, "submission_id": "15cnbe6", "title": "AITA for getting upset with my fiance over his girl best friend affecting our wedding plans?", "selftext": "My fiance and I are getting married next year. I've had my eyes set on an extremely competitive venue in October. There is only 1 available day for us that works for my family, and it happens to fall on his \u2018girl best friend\u2019s birthday. There are several reasons as to why I\u2019m dead set on October. I have always dreamed of a fall wedding, September is difficult for me because it is when my brother passed, and November doesn\u2019t really work with our family\u2019s travel schedules.\n\n\r  \nMy issue is more with how my fiance approached the issue of his friends birthday and the potential wedding date overlapping rather than him not wanting those on the same day. Instead of asking me if there is any way we can compromise (which, really there isn't but I\u2019d appreciate that thought), he went off on me saying that it\u2019s Veronica's birthday and \u201cI know that.\u201d and that I \u201ccan't be upset\u201d when he puts off celebrating our anniversary for her birthday. It felt like he was accusing me of purposefully plotting to \u2026 stop them from celebrating together?\n\n\r  \nThis died down a bit and then when I was talking about the guest meals. I spoke with the planner and she suggested that, to help with costs, the bride and groom will be served fish (I am pescatarian), along with select family members who are pescatarian, and everyone else will be served chicken. I have all the fish eaters together so people don\u2019t feel confused or offended by them being offered different, somewhat cheaper food. He then argued with me that Veronica loves fish, and I should put her down for fish as well. I told him I didn\u2019t want guests to be upset at her getting fish while sitting with other guests and them not having the option. If it was dietary it would be different, but he says no, Veronica is a picky eater and that's essentially the same as not eating chicken by choice for health/ethic reasons.\n\n\r  \nIt felt like I was walking on eggshells as we kept getting into fights about Veronica and our wedding. He told me that he was talking about our cake in a group chat of his and she wanted him to suggest a different flavor combo to me since she said a wedding she went to prior had the same and she did not like it.\n\n\r  \nI flipped out for once and just screamed that it\u2019s OUR, MY, wedding- me and him, NOT hers. It's okay to have opinions but hers literally do not matter this one singular time. He told me I was out of line and had a clear dislike for Veronica despite her trying to be helpful and I am bitter of their friendship. He left and hasn\u2019t told me where he is staying, and he won\u2019t be coming home until I admit fault and promise to be \u201cmore accepting\u201d of his female friend(s). I honestly try my best to be nice despite how rudely she treats me. She basically flat out ignores me. Our friends seem to not want to get involved. I expected them to have my back and now I'm questioning if I'm crazy (and an Ahole).", "created_utc": 1690620722, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15cnbe6/aita_for_getting_upset_with_my_fiance_over_his/", "score": 134, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

At this point, I\u2019d push the wedding to the following year (because Oct is the only viable month to have a wedding) and try again to get the venue on a day it isn\u2019t a friends birthday.  Or, you know, cut your losses and cancel it altogether because it seems as if there\u2019s a third person in your relationship, and that doesn\u2019t work for most people.", "NTA.

My job is to make sure I support any relationship he gets into. To make sure said girlfriend is comfortable with me. And to bow out and back off if she is not. Because this is my friend dude. I want him to find a girl and be happy  . Real friends want that for their friends.  His best, she is causing issues and he's letting her. It's not cool bro.  He shouldn't be worried about her feelings over yalls wedding.  Does she get a saybin your kids names and where you live and work too?", "NTA..Op, I'd call off this engagement.

He keeps putting her before you...", "NTA. Do not marry this guy. He is in love with Veronica. If she ever decides she wants to be with him, he will leave you in the dust, no matter how long you\u2019ve been together. He has already made it clear that he prioritizes her over you in everything. You will always be competing with her, and you will always lose.", "He would choose this woman\u2019s birthday over your wedding anniversary. \n\n\nTake a moment and think about that. \n\n\nTell him to not bother coming back from HERS.

So maybe its a esh thing but not sure.\n\nI totally get where you're coming from but it does sound a little like you take issue with her and so would you be as annoyed if he said \"you can't be upset if I spend time with them on our anniversary\" about the wedding date if it clashed with his family member or another friend's birthday? Maybe maybe not.\n\nShe 100% shouldn't be inputting what to have at your wedding, you can have what cake you want and you're absolutely right about that. But again is that just because she said it or would you say the same if someone else did. Either way no one should be getting a say or opinion but you and fh unless you've asked for the opinion.\n\nI realise this is totally off topic but guest meal wise, I'm genuinely curious as its not computing for me so I'm really not judging just trying to understand, why aren't you offering the 2 options to everyone? I get what he's saying in that not everyone likes chicken or fish, or is it just that one is more expensive than the other and you can't afford to accommodate everyone? Which is also fair enough.\n\nIts your wedding and your relationship only you both get a say, so maybe you both need to make comprismises and understand eachother in what you both do and dont want for it.\n\nI get where you're both coming from but it does sound like there's maybe 3 people in this relationship and it needs addressing and he definitely needs to figure out what his friendship with her really is. Maybe it is a completely platoinic friends thing and the issue is with you, or your gut is telling you that its more than friendship, either way it needs figuring out now before you get married.", "!updateme", "Slight ESH, leaning towards NTA. \n\nHe sucks for seemingly prioritizing her needs/wants over yours. Has he known her longer than you have known your fianc\u00e9 and has he always prioritized her in this manner? It seems borderline if not totally codependent.\n\nIf that is the case, you should have \u201claid down the law\u201d much sooner so that it didn\u2019t build up to this thing where he\u2019s trying to placate her over you on YOUR wedding.

Hell no your family can cancel their plans if they want to attend your wedding.\n\nAs for October, there is 1 day that your fianc\u00e9 has something on, his best friends birthday - it doesn\u2019t matter that they are a woman- and you suddenly can only get married on that day\u2026..\n\nI hope you are prepared to be single soon, because your fianc\u00e9 is going to wake up and see that you are a controlling manipulative narcissist who doesn\u2019t deserve to be in a relationship.", "Nta this is bizarre and I would not tolerate it.

For someone that's getting married...he has way too much emotional entanglement with this woman.", " NTA.  Wedding planning is stressful but sounds like your fianc\u00e9 is planning his wedding with Veronica.

Regardless of the best friend, your fiance is mistreating and minisiming you. That is unacceptable, and you need to put a stop to it, immediately.\n\nThe wedding needs to be cancelled, at least. If he wants to be in a relationship with you, you need some couples counselling and for him to realise that his priorities are completely wrong. He can't disappear and throw tantrums.
