I don\u2019t want to know you\u2019re raw dogging a dude, keep it in the privacy of your own bedroom.\u201d He also took money from me, had no sense of boundaries, & was just really gross. I tried to cut contact with him my Senior year of high school, but he got a job at my old place of employment cuz nowhere else would hire him. \n\nDespite being a bad employee, he made lots of friends at my old job before he was fired for NCNS & selling tobacco & alcohol to a minor. That\u2019s to say, he & I have a bunch of mutual friends. Recently, he announced that he\u2019s having a kid. Good for him. I didn\u2019t care, but I found out he\u2019s been spreading a rumor about me through our friend group. That pissed me off, but then he messaged me directly, asking why I didn\u2019t want to be in his kid\u2019s life, since we used to be close. I ignored him until he said that he wants me to be his kids\u2019 godfather. I asked about the rumor & he said, \u201cit was just a joke bro.\u201d I said, \u201chonestly I don\u2019t care that you\u2019re having a kid. I don\u2019t wanna hear about it.

I reminded him that he consistently uses that exact phrase about gay people. He said that\u2019s different. I said I\u2019m not his friend anymore & to leave me alone. He posted pictures of our private conversation, out of context, to the group chat trying to shame me. It worked. A bunch of people got onto me. Even after I clarified the context, I\u2019m still losing friends over this, & one friend who I put as a reference on a job application said he\u2019s gonna badmouth me to my potential employer if I don\u2019t apologize to Jake. I didn\u2019t think so originally, but this whole ordeal has made me think. AITA?\n\nEdit: the rumor he\u2019s spreading about me is that I\u2019m a male escort, and that I\u2019m gonna drop out of college to do it full time. Doesn\u2019t seem to me like the kind of thing someone who wants me to be their kids godfather would want floating around, especially given how conservative his close friends and family is,", "created_utc": 1702075837, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18dyyyq/aita_for_telling_an_ex_friend_that_i_dont_want_to/", "score": 65, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Post receipts of him being a total ass to you, and see who sticks around. Anyone who can't play nice is an asshole and straight up isn't your friend. Jake is a fucking hypocrite for getting offended at the exact same phrases you've used. Sounds like you could use better, real friends. Now that you've finished high school, you can lead your own life away from the jackasses. \n\nFrankly I've had \"friends\" take the exact same tone and attitude with me, so I understand how frustrating it can be when someone smears you unjustly.

You definitely didn\u2019t deserve that kind of behavior and he certainly didn\u2019t like when you modeled it back to him.
