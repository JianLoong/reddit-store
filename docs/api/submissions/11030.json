He can have the bed to share with the boyfriend.", "NTA for setting boundaries. \n\nYTA for letting it get to this point. He felt entitled to manipulate you because he\u2019s accustomed to being prioritized. You usually let your son have the bedroom, and your daughter sleeps on the couch. You should have had them alternate. \n\nYou are eventually going to run into the issue of both kids bringing significant others for the same holiday/occasion. How will you deal with that then?", "NTA but no offense, you raised this child so where did he learn the selfishness from? I think you\u2019ve coddled and created this monster because it doesn\u2019t make sense to me he gets the room every time. Fair would be switching turns or if anything, the girl should get the bed because societal custom is to treat the women as more \u2018dainty\u2019 and he as a man could \u2018tough out\u2019 the couch. He should be happy to give his bed up for his sister this ONE time she has the bf as a guest, because courtesy is to offer the guest the nicer accommodations too. He could grumble a bit, and move on, but he\u2019s having a tantrum basically. Is there some underlying reason he needs the privacy of the room? I think his behavior is odd and he will have issues in life if he gets that upset about not \u2018getting his way.\u2019", "NTA. He's fine making his sister sleep on the couch regularly, but on the only occasion when he has to for logistical reasons, he throws a tantrum.", "NTA. You probably could have worded things a bit kinder but at the end of the day he was acting very entitled. If he constantly gets the bed, the sister should be able to have it every once in a while regardless of the boyfriend. Not being willing to sleep on a couch for one night to bring your family peace and happiness is pretty selfish.", "NTA. \n\nAsk him to explain why his sister isn't too old to sleep on the couch, but he is. \n\nThe sleeping arrangements you proposed was logical. \n\nThat being said, telling someone to \"just get over it\" has rarely solved anything. Being a bit more tactful might make this situation a bit more palatable. Perhaps you could offer to srt up an inflatable mattress if he'd prefer that?", "Ugh\u2026.why did you let your son take it because he\u2019s older? Why not have them switch off? \n\nNTA for stopping it now, but you know if your daughter comes without bf, son will expect the room. If he is too old\nTo sleep in a sofa, he can get a hotel room or not come.", "NTA. You didn\u2019t pick a stranger over him, he picked \u201cnot the couch\u201d over his father. On a more significant note, he needs to seriously work on his superiority / inferiority issues.", "NTA.  Seems he's a bit too used to getting his way and doesn't respect you and your decisions.  Perhaps he needs to miss out and learn a lesson.  Stick to your guns, but next time, I'd rephrase what you said.  It wasn't the best choice of words.", "NTA, your son is whining and being entitled. He talks about being a grown man, but he sure as hell doesn't act like one.\n\nIf he decides not to come because of this, that's on him, not you.", "NTA, if he doesn't want to sleep on the couch he can bring an air mattress. Besides, it's uncalled for, for your adult child to make you play this imaginary game of who's the favorite child.", "NTA, everyone sleeps on a couch sometimes", "NTA. Sleeping on the couch has no age restrictions. Ask any married man", "NTA He needs to grow up and realize the world does not revolve around him. \n\nHere is where you might be TAH... Why did your daughter have to sleep on the couch all this time?", "NTA. It's an extreme reaction to being told that he's going to give up the bedroom and sleep on the couch for this visit. Your son is acting like a spoiled brat.", "ESH. You for not making your son and daughter alternate on the couch, and your son for being entitled.", "Nta.. you did and said everything right. Let him make his choice about showing up or not, but stick to you guns. \n\nHe's acting like a baby", "NTA, \u201ca grown man\u201d can sleep on the floor if he needs to, he even has a couch now. He\u2019s better off not attending than coming with a sour face and ruining everybody\u2019s day.", "NTA You're son is thinking irrationally and acing immature. If he doesn't show please proceed to enjoy the birthday as you would prior to his ignorance.", "NTA-So let's see. Every time he has stayed at your place he has stayed in the bedroom and your daughter has slept on the couch. Now you have, for the first time, asked him to sleep on the couch so his sister can have privacy with her boyfriend. He throws a hissy fit like an entitled bratty child and thinks he's been disrespected. No, you have been disrespected. You did the right and proper thing in your house and he doesn't like it. Boo Hoo.", "NTA he was trying to guilt/manipulate you into changing your mind. You didn\u2019t choose a stranger you gave the appropriate sleeping place to the appropriate people.", "NTA ! Way to hold your boundary. Your son forgot whose house it was for a second. Also, is he lonely and feeling jealous of sister?", "NTA.\n\nDo I assume correctly that your daughter is also an adult? You said in another comment she is 7 years younger, but not their ages. Even without a BF in the picture, the brother should trade off with the sister if they are both healthy adults. The older part makes sense when one is a kid and the other is an adult, but not when they are both healthy adults. At that point it just seems a bit sexist.", "Honestly YTA for giving your son preferential treatment in the first place just because he\u2019s older. The reason he\u2019s acting like an entitled brat now is because you taught him to be one. Nice work", "It sounds like you were being totally reasonable. At least I'd not have any problem with being any of the people in the situation. \n\nNTA and not sure why your \"grown man\" child cares about it.", "NTA - Is he spoiled or just childish?", "NTA\n\nYour son might be an adult, but he clearly still acts like a child.", "NTA. My mom insists on sleeping on my couch when she visits even though I insist on her taking my room and I'll take the couch. She's in her mid 70s. If he doesn't like it he can stay in a hotel.", "NTA. YOu son seems to be stuck at age of 7", "NTA.  People of all ages sleep on coaches occasionally.  Your son's sense of importance is a bit punctured, is all, and that's probably good for him.", "NTA. What an entitled little boy.", "Ever heard of an air mattress? NTA tho", "YTA for always treating your son preferentially because he\u2019s older. He is always going to be older. That\u2019s no reason to treat your daughter as his subordinate. You\u2019ve created an entitled little asshole who thinks being first born entitles him to first dibs on everything.", "NTA But.... You were acting authorative with him (YOU decided he will sleep on the couch) instead of engaging him to make a compromise and then it is his decision. And telling someone to \"get over it\" is dismissive and he thinks you are not listening to his feelings. That is not th ebest way to influence someone. Was there a more engaging way to talk with him and ask him to compromise? This is a perfect example of how a minor issue gets blown way out of proportion because someone said the wrong thing.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Instead of alternating. Now he feels entitled to being treated and had this tantrum. He should have acted mor grown up, but ultimately you are the one who trained him to expect preferred treatment!", "Unfortunately, this is the fruits of years of prioritizing his needs over your daughter's. Not as visible, but probably equally present, are the fruits on her side, of the years of being shown her needs are never as important as someone else's. \n\nNTA for your actions here; but unfortunately, Y T A for creating the dynamic you're now getting the fallout from. This may be the first time, but it won't be the last. It will be difficult to break this pattern in both your kids at this point - *both*, because the impact on your daughter is likely to be equally serious for her wellbeing, just better hidden, and easier to ignore because her training has been \"make it easier for others,\" whereas your son's has been \"make it easier for *me*,\" - but it's critical to their health and happiness down the road. \n\nThe couch is a good first step.

A possible future son-in-law who might take up some of the attention and role the son alone enjoys now. Not starting off on the right foot with his brother-in-law, who no doubt has heard about the tantrum by now. Has this son always gotten his way?", "Alternatively, tell him you can rent him a pack n play.
