One girl let's call her G has her bathroom. Me and my other roommate L share a bathroom. \n\nThe moment L moved in she rearranged all of our stuff everywhere. I had this nice package of extra soft 4-layer toilet paper. L started stealing the rolls from the bathroom and using them for her things because the only one she has is this one-layer one that you can see through which is kinda disgusting and I am not surprised she likes mine so much. She was also using my face towel for her hands and she was wiping the floor with it even when I told her not to use it. So I just took all of my stuff including toilet paper from the bathroom. That day she was crying to her boyfriend that I took the nice toilet paper away. Not gonna like it made me happy.\n\nSo let's get to the topic. L's boyfriend lives with her. He sleeps there, he takes showers in our bathroom, he eats there, and he is there every day. I don't mind him being there I don't care. I care about the water they use. Both of them take baths every day. She leaves the heater in the bathroom on and leaves the light on everywhere. This means that we will have to pay more for these utilities. Our landlord told us that we would pay it at the end of our lease if we ever go over the limit. I don't want to pay more. I live from salary to salary so I can't even afford it. \n\nI told L that this bothers me but she didn't care. She said that it was my problem. Today I saw our landlord and I decided to tell her. I told our landlord that I don't want to get charged extra for utilities because L lives there with her bf. I don't mind him staying there I just don't want to get charged extra. The landlord told me she will talk with her.

If he\u2019s there every day, he should be pitching in for utilities every month. I personally would have done that before going to the landlord but if you felt that was your only option, I understand what you did. The bottom line is you shouldn\u2019t be paying for him to live there, and it sounds like a legit concern at this point", "ESH\n\nYou claim not to care, but you deliberately started with a full paragraph unrelated to the situation in an effort to get the reader on your side for the dispute to follow.\n\nYou knew what you were doing when you told the landlord and the consequences that it would have\n\nEdit: Info, are utilities included in your rent? It seems implied in your comment", ">the fact that L having her BF there all the time is literally costing you and your other roommate money.\n\nIs it tho? I get the impression that utilities are included. It seems that OP is tenuously using this as justification for telling the landlord, but my guess is that it isn't the actual reason.\n\nProb trying to get roommate kicked out and using landlord to do it", "We each pay rent for our room separately to the landlord utilities are partly included in rent but if we go over the average limit all of us will have to pay at the end of our lease. \nMy other flatmate G is pretty upset about it and she wanted to talk about L with our landlord too she has her own problems with her. \nIf L's boyfriend stayed over a few times a week I wouldn't mind at all but he is there every day.", "We live in an only a female apartment we each pay our rent separately per room.

There is a reason it is all female and the roommate is likely breaking the terms of her lease.

As such, the breakdown should be re-evaluated should he continue to stay. Before you even get to that discussion though, should L get angry and cause trouble, make sure you and G are a united front. And until the bf officially lives there he doesn't get to be a part of that conversation. I'd also recommend looking into this 'you night pay extra after you move out' thing. Where I live I don't think that's legally binding. There must be a way to monitor your usage, like monthly meter readings.", "Does your agreement not mention anything about overnight guests? Just with it being a female only apartment L might be in breach by effectively moving him in, not just having over nights.", "Are utilities included in your rent?", "Something sounds off about this.\n\nIt should be either landlord pays utilities and its included in your rent, or its not included and therefore landlord has nothing to do with utilities and for tenants to agree among themselves how to split it.\n\nHaving them partially included sounds ridiculous and overly complicated for all involved. Are you sure that this is the agreement? Your lease would have to document this including the limits that you mention. \n\nWhat does your actual lease say in writing about utilities?\n\nFor anyone else reading this, has anyone else had or heard of an arrangement like this??", "Thats fine and I'd agree that is a valid reason to go to landlord, I'm confused as to why OP isn't admiting to that, and instead saying that she went to LL because of potential utilities increase.\n\nIf utilities are included in rent, then there is no cost increase, if not included, then tenants to agree among themselves how to split it which has nothing to do with the landlord", "It's legal here that you can be charged after your lease ends. We have it in the accommodation contract that all of our excessive charges will be paid at the end of the contract.", "We can have overnight guests if all of us living in the apartment agree on it. She asked us if we mind her boyfriend coming over every now and then we said no because our boyfriends come too like 1-2 a week but she forgot to mention that her boyfriend is here 7/7 days of the week living here.", "Yes, I have encountered this in countries outside of the US with electricity. For example, 10kwh of electricity per day is included in the monthly rent. Any electricity over that amount was charged at a per kwh charge.", "I live in student accommodation. In our country, you pay utilities every month and pay for them a certain amount which is fixed for the year, but because of the crisis it went up mid-year for everyone, but if you go over the limit at the end of the year you will get like paper from the company that provides you with utilities that you have to pay them or they are going to give you some money back. So that's what our landlord will get at the end of the year. I am not sure how else to explain how it works.", "So we have utilities included in the rent. I live in student accommodation. In our country, you pay for utilities monthly fixed amount for the year. At the end of the year, you get like a letter from your utility companies that you own them money or that they will return some money to you. Since there is a kinda utility crisis right now and prices increased. Our landlord will charge us the excessive amount that she has to pay at the end of the year. The amount will be divided between me, G and L. It bothers me because her boyfriend love there kinda rent free and the amount is not gonna be fairly divided between us since we each will pay 1/3 of it even when L lives there in 2 people.", "OP said there is a limit on the included utility bills, and there are extra charges incurred if they go over it. OP said L and BF filling a bath tub with water daily and leaving a heater on in the bathroom. That would definitely push the utilities up massively in my country at the moment.", "I can see in another comment that L only moved in a month ago and brought this guy. Yeah, bf has gotta go. L is displaying incredibly poor flatmate etiquette. The minute he stops staying over every night your usage will massively decrease. You've got nothing to feel bad about. Just make sure you and G are on the same page.", "Yes that's what I mean we have it per month. And at the end of the year you get like letter that states how much you have to pay if you use extra.", "And is there a credit back if you go under it?\n\nIs it balanced across the year, like if you go under in the summer months but over in the winter months?", "Can I ask why it bothers you about a possibility of increased utilities, but doesn't seem to bother you that the boyfriend doesn't pay a share in the rent?\n\nIs this dispute purely about money? or is it a personality clash between yourself and L/boyfriend?", "Yeah, I seen that after I commented, and that makes sense.\n\nSomething still seems off about this post tho.\nIf it is purely a financial and cost issue, then why all the info about towels and toilet paper etc\n\nIf its just financial then he main grievance should be about splitting rent 4 ways, and not just about an increase in utilities", "Well he is not supposed to live here. It's only female student accommodation. We each pay rent with some utilities separately for each of our rooms. In my country, you pay like fixed rate for utilities and at the end of the year, you get a letter from the utility company on how much you own them or if they owe you some money. So my landlord will get this and see that our apartment is overcharged on the water for example and she will divide it between the 3 of us so each of us will pay 1/3 of it. I have never seen L or he boyfriend till a month ago when she moved her so it's nothing personal between us. I mostly just hear her existence and see her once a day in the kitchen.", "Have you asked L and boyfriend to pay you and the other roommate to cover the extra expense?\n\nWhen you told the landlord? What was the desired response/ outcome?", "I talked with L I told her that I am not comfortable paying more since she is the one leaving all the things on or using them more since she lives there with her boyfriend. She told me that's my problem, not hers. That's how our discussion ended. \n\nThe outcome I wanted from my landlord was that I and G don't have to pay for their irresponsibility. I just wanted to let her know about the situation since it's only a female apartment and he is staying here not like 1-2 a week but every day using our things and at the end, it will be me and G who have to pay for it.", "She doesn't want the bf there. Why will the roommate move in another roommate especially male to an all female hostel?\n\nWhy can they not move out and spare everyone this nonsense? \n\nDogging Op on every intent and why and credit is whatever man. \n\nShe moved into an all female hostel, simple. You don't have to know all her reasons.", ">She doesn't want the bf there. \n\n**I don't mind him there, I don't care**......that is literally her words in the post"]}
