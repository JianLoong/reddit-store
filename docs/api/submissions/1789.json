One girl let's call her G has her bathroom. Me and my other roommate L share a bathroom. \n\nThe moment L moved in she rearranged all of our stuff everywhere. I had this nice package of extra soft 4-layer toilet paper. L started stealing the rolls from the bathroom and using them for her things because the only one she has is this one-layer one that you can see through which is kinda disgusting and I am not surprised she likes mine so much. She was also using my face towel for her hands and she was wiping the floor with it even when I told her not to use it. So I just took all of my stuff including toilet paper from the bathroom. That day she was crying to her boyfriend that I took the nice toilet paper away. Not gonna like it made me happy.\n\nSo let's get to the topic. L's boyfriend lives with her. He sleeps there, he takes showers in our bathroom, he eats there, and he is there every day. I don't mind him being there I don't care. I care about the water they use. Both of them take baths every day. She leaves the heater in the bathroom on and leaves the light on everywhere. This means that we will have to pay more for these utilities. Our landlord told us that we would pay it at the end of our lease if we ever go over the limit. I don't want to pay more. I live from salary to salary so I can't even afford it. \n\nI told L that this bothers me but she didn't care. She said that it was my problem. Today I saw our landlord and I decided to tell her. I told our landlord that I don't want to get charged extra for utilities because L lives there with her bf. I don't mind him staying there I just don't want to get charged extra. The landlord told me she will talk with her. This will probably cause a shitstorm between me and L. \n\nSo AITA for telling my landlord about this?\n\n\nUPDATE1:\nFirst I would like to thank all of you kind strangers for your advice and words of encouragement it made me feel better.\n\nAlso, the boyfriend is not on the lease he can\u2019t be since like the whole part of the building with all of the apartments is female-only. A lot of girls who live here feel uneasy around guys that\u2019s why they chose to live here. If there was a different girl living with L she might not even give L permission to have her bf over anytime because she would feel uncomfortable with him being in her safe space. \n\nSo our landlord came to pay a visit to L. I wasn\u2019t home at the time but G was. G told me that she met our landlord in front of our apartment and started chatting with her.\n\n Our landlord asked G about L and G went little ape shit because she is very neat and likes things where they are but L leaves her shit everywhere and doesn\u2019t do her dishes right away just leaves them in the sink, doesn\u2019t clean after cooking, etc. I don\u2019t mind some of the things she does or more like doesn\u2019t do until I want to use for example the only pan we have and it\u2019s dirty in the sink. G also confronted L many times about this but nothing changed.\n\nSo the landlord peacefully listened to her and walked with her to our apartment. The landlord told G that there were some issues with L last year concerning her and her bf. G told her that yeah the guy lives here all the time and that she hears him come and leave every day. \nL uses this as her student accommodation every year. I didn't know it.\n\nAll of this happened like 10 minutes after I left the house. Before I left L was still home and didn\u2019t leave before G came. L leaves the door to our apartment unlocked and I and G lock it so we kinda know who leaves the apartment or who comes. It was still locked when G came. \n\nL heard G and the landlord talking and locked herself in her room. She pretended that she wasn\u2019t there when the landlord knocked on the door. The landlord just thanked G and left some package that came in the mail for L in front of her door. G is making something in the kitchen and L opened the door from her room, just took the package, and closed the door again. G told me it was hilarious seeing the hand snap the package and close the door quickly again.  \nThat\u2019s everything for now. \n\nI am also sorry for any grammatical mistakes English is my second language.", "created_utc": 1667908790, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ypk11z/aita_for_telling_my_landlord_about_my_roommates/", "score": 1890, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

As such, the breakdown should be re-evaluated should he continue to stay. Before you even get to that discussion though, should L get angry and cause trouble, make sure you and G are a united front. And until the bf officially lives there he doesn't get to be a part of that conversation. I'd also recommend looking into this 'you night pay extra after you move out' thing.

In our country, you pay for utilities monthly fixed amount for the year. At the end of the year, you get like a letter from your utility companies that you own them money or that they will return some money to you. Since there is a kinda utility crisis right now and prices increased. Our landlord will charge us the excessive amount that she has to pay at the end of the year.

That would definitely push the utilities up massively in my country at the moment.", "I can see in another comment that L only moved in a month ago and brought this guy. Yeah, bf has gotta go. L is displaying incredibly poor flatmate etiquette. The minute he stops staying over every night your usage will massively decrease. You've got nothing to feel bad about. Just make sure you and G are on the same page.", "Yes that's what I mean we have it per month.

So my landlord will get this and see that our apartment is overcharged on the water for example and she will divide it between the 3 of us so each of us will pay 1/3 of it.

I don\u2019t know how she just said fine with a whole extra person moving in", "I am not 100% sure if you can get it from the companies that provide you with your utilities every month but from what I know even at home we got it only once a year and at that time we saw if we went over the limit or not.

I would not be ok if I lived in a female only apartment with a dude being there every day. I get the occasional guest and sneaking in for some personal time but staying there and pretty much living there is a big FAT NO.  She is the AH and he is an AH and a bum.

In fact you're doing the right thing here. L is not.", "NTA.  L should have asked you and G if her BF could move in and she should have offered to pay any overage charge.", "NTA, not only you talked to her and she dismissed it but her lack of action can impact your financial situation since you\u2019re living from paycheque to paycheque", "NTA. OP, please share another update sometime soon.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nHer bf is not on the lease and should not be staying there using up resources. Shame on her for stealing your toilet paper.\n\nDesperate rude and disrespectful.", "In a female only apartment, it's not acceptable to have a male resident. Most of the money problems would be helped by evicting the illegal tenant.

L is lucky that the landlord didn't kick her out or make a bigger deal about it.  Seems like your roommate is taking advantage of you being nice, her and her BF are definitely the AHs.", "Something similar happened to me but I didnt say anything to not upset anyone, so good for you you had the bravery to speak up. NTA.", "Not only this but most landlords have occupancy rules for a reason, not just for funzies. Since the BF is effectively living there, the landlord needs to know.

Her behavior as a roommate, on its own, is horrible (stealing your stuff, using your face towel to clean the floor and not stopping once asked, not cleaning up after herself,  etc) but then you add in having someone else living rent free and running up your bills to which she doesn't even offer to cover any overages?? No. Gross. Get her out of there as soon as possible. The disrespect is off the charts.", "NTA. Well she told you it was your problem so like a boss you handled that problem. I hope your landlord does evict her as clearly she is not a good roommate or tenant and she\u2019s crossing the line.", "NTA. You went to her first and she completely dismissed your valid concerns. It sounds like she\u2019s selfish, entitled and inconsiderate in general. I personally would not be cool with her bf living there if for no other reason than bathroom scheduling.

That's fine, but most of this post is just catty shit that is irrelevant.  All it does is underscore the fact that you didn't feel bad turning her in.\n\nHaving said that, you should feel bad having turned her in.  Not because she is a slob or uses your TP,  but because she is violating the basic premise of this housing.  No men!!!\n\nYou and the other residents should not have to deal with it.  period.
