I chose a set of Royal Albert plates from the gift registry and they've already been delivered.\n\nThe invitation said the ceremony would be first, followed immediately by meals and guests would start making their way to the reception hall. Invitation also said to \"be prepared for a night of drinking and dancing\" at the reception.\n\nA couple of days ago Isabelle called me, we made some small talk. She then said she wanted to call just to confirm I knew the reception was more for partying, and it isn't really suitable for me considering I'm not even 21. I said I'm fine drinking water and soda, but she replied the capacity for the reception hall is smaller so they're not including younger guests. Mind you this is a child free wedding so there isn't really any \"younger\" guests, I get not wanting to have kids around for the reception.\n\nIsabelle said I'm invited to the ceremony and dinner. I was confused and told her this is really weird, the invitation said ceremony and reception. She replied she's sorry for the misunderstanding but it said there would be drinking and stuff.\n\nEventually I told her okay, I respect that but if she could kindly send the plates back so I can get a refund. Isabelle asked why because I'm going to be there for the most important part and they've included me in the catering. I said I was expecting to attend the entire wedding, not half and I bought the gift based on that. I might not attend at all now, so she needs to send the plates back and I'll decide another suitable gift, if any.\n\nShe said no one takes back gifts and it's not like I'm uninvited, if I don't want to come now that's on me and I've already gotten the gift.\n\nI also got a text from my other cousin (Isabelle's sister) that I'm making a scene (she's 19 by the way and attending the reception. I know another cousin the same age is me is attending the reception), and I think Isabelle's talked to other relatives about it. My fiance thinks I'm okay though. So was I the AH asking to return the plates?\n\n**Edit- I have a small update. I just got off the phone with my mom because I wanted to ask her if they'd picked a gift for Isabelle yet, otherwise they can potentially take mine and the whole situation. She said Isabelle called her** ***also*** **and said they're welcome to the ceremony, but the reception is more for friends and partying. My parents are definitely above 21 and they also had ceremony and reception on their invitation.**\n\n**Parents were planning to gift money so they haven't given it yet. They think it was really rude of Isabelle to invite then uninvite, and they might attend the ceremony but not sure. And I am officially confusion. Why not just have ceremony on our invitations in the first place??**", "created_utc": 1671187778, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/znbv4h/aita_for_asking_my_cousin_for_the_wedding_gift/", "score": 8925, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You were uninvited. Ofcourse you're free to request your gift back.  Classy? Probably not but that's not the brides theme anyways.", "NTA. She is disrespecting you. Your are an adult, not a child. And her sister who is younger than you is going.", "NTA.\n\nYou can go to a party and not drink. Kids are allowed in restaurants which have bars. High school dances have people dancing without drinking. If you are being treated like a minor, you are allowed to act childish.", "NTA. She doesnt want you there, no matter the excuse. Either she can invite you to the reception or give the plates back. Unfortunately though, neither will probably happen. I would suggest cutting your losses and not going at all. I hope her plates are broken when she opens the box.", "NTA , if she didn't want younger aged people during reception then she should have informed you before but she didn't. U gave the gift on the basis that ur attending the whole wedding, since she can suddenly uninvite u from reception then u can also ask for ur gift back. \n \nTo be honest, I feel lyk she wanted the gift before rejecting u.\ud83d\ude02 (Sry coz i always think of the worst reasons for things happening) But whatever it is u r absolutely right in wanting ur gift back. But ur relationship with her might be damaged so be ready for that. I don't even think she thinks much of the relationship between you and her since she is uninviting u from reception by not giving a proper reason other than ur age and also acting salty abt returning the gift.", "The bit about not being able to drink is just her cover. She admits that what really happened is that she invited too many people and the venue needs her to trim it down. It\u2019s probably a fire code violation. The other D-list guests are probably getting the same speech, but with a different reason behind it.\n\nOn wedding discussion forums you always get gimme pigs giving advice about inviting people you\u2019re not close to because they\u2019ll probably send a gift in lieu of attending. She was hoping you would do that, and when you didn\u2019t she tried to force your hand. She just didn\u2019t expect you to thwart her plan so directly. \n\nShe\u2019s not treating you like a beloved family member, so you\u2019re NTA for not behaving like one.\n\nI don\u2019t think you\u2019re going to get that gift back, so I\u2019d give up on that, but asking was the right move. I also think you should skip the wedding entirely. No wedding food is good enough to make up for a slight like that.\n\nBe prepared for a lot of family members to have a lot of thoughts on this.", "NTA, unless your cousin is planning for an orgy for her wedding reception, I don't see why a 20 year old is not invited. Looks like she's just making up an excuse to keep you out and you are right to ask for your gift back as it feels like you are not part of the entire wedding. You are right in not wanting to attend it if you dont want to as its kind of insulting to be called a kid at 20 when people could join the army at 18.", "NTA - she should have clarified this with you upon sending the invitation, not after. And in general, you are 20, not 17. She should at most approached you to ensure you would not partake in underage drinking, not ban you from the party. There were many ways of dealing with this situation and she chose a wrong one. I've never heard of being \"partially\" invited to a wedding ceremony and would also have been offended. There's many ways to \"hide\" the crazy partying from guests you might not comfortable partying around (like having an \"after party\" or a \"fake ending\"). But not clearly telling someone - okay, now we want to go wild so please excuse yourself.", "I'll go NTA on this one. She is effectively uninviting you and making you feel unwelcome. Even if you are technically allowed to attend the ceremony and dinner (lol at her using the \"most important part\" justification), that whole experience will be tainted by the upcoming point where they throw you out but not those 21+.  You aren't a full guest, you are justified in your demanding the gift back.\n\nAlso, why the fuck does it matter if 18-20's are dancing with the other adults? Are bartenders not capable of checking IDs and giving out wristbands? That's their job that every state in the US requires them to do by law. (I am guessing you are in the US because of the 21 for alcohol cutoff you mentioned).", "I understand why you are hurt. And the bride is lacking in compassion and a poor communicator at best. Gifts aren\u2019t payment for a wedding but a sentiment / support of the relationship. I am going with NTA because I understand where you are coming from. \n\nPersonally, I wouldn\u2019t attend the wedding and \u201cpoorly communicate\u201d your intentions. This would force her to \u201cpay for your plate\u201d that no one will eat. But I\u2019m petty like that. \ud83d\ude06", "NTA\n\nYou never uninvite people because of numbers who have already accepted, also the age is clearly false due to the 19 year old still getting to go.\n\nThe real answer is 'I want to prioritise other people and don't value your attendance' to which asking for the gift back is petty but understandable.", "NTA. Funny though, she considers you old enough to be taking a full fledged gift from you, but you are not old enough to be included in reception party. Lol.\n\nEDIT: so based on your edits, it is now clear that Isabella doesn't want family at her party, and they are just for gift- grabbing. A decent thing would have been to maintain that upfront, but she seems no class act.", "NTA\n\n\nYou are NOT a child of you can vote. What a pathetic excuse.\n\n\nLet them keep the gift. Ditch the wedding. Think twice about being a friend to her in the diet place.", "Nta. I would normally say asking for a gift back is extremely rude. However, the circumstances here make it totally ok. Sending someone a FULL invite, and then waiting for them to send you a gift, and then kicking them out of the actual celebration is a form of grifting, in my opinion. Her using your age is an excuse, and a bad one at that.", "NTA but Isabelle is. So no younger guest unless its her sister and a cousin she really likes, both of whom are younger then you. \n\nThe invitation was for the entire event, you accepted and chose a present based on that, that was the social contract you entered into with her. She has now broken that contract so yeah, she needs tonreturn the gift.", "NTA\n\nIf she\u2019s having a wedding, it\u2019s her responsibility to be in charge of making sure everything is communicated correctly. Her leaving this bit of communication out also showcases that you could potentially be an afterthought.\nThat aside, the way she went about communicating it to you is really disrespectful. By this point, if I were in her position, I would just personally acknowledge my error in communication and make sure there\u2019s accommodation at the reception for underage guests, as they shouldn\u2019t have to pay for my mistake in planning.\nExpecting you to accommodate for HER error shows how unwelcoming she is towards you at this wedding. I honestly don\u2019t blame you for wanting a refund, and honestly if you don\u2019t even go that\u2019s understandable, as well.\n\nEDIT: thought it through some more and changed opinion", "NTA but you should know better now to bring any gift for her and her family along with you to the event.", "NTA, but you ain't ever going to get those plates back", "NTA I'd ask why others your age are allowed but not you", "So you're old enough to send gifts but not old enough to attend party? NTA", "NTA, Isabella waited until she received your $160 gift to disinvite you from her reception while allowing others your age to attend. \n\nHad she done so before receiving your gift or offered to reimburse you for the gift then I would understand. But she chose to wait until she got the goods to uninvite you. \n\nShe comes across as a user right now.", "NTA\n\nTell someone else going to claim your gift so she doesn\u2019t get extra. I\u2019m petty like that .", "NTA. If you're too young for the reception you're too young for buying gifts.\n\nMake her a cute drawing she can hang on the fridge.", "NTA, she\u2019s changed the deal why cant you ?", "NTA, i don't even know how to find the right words, the audacity", "Nta your cousin is beyond rude. You don\u2019t only invite people to the ceremony", "NTA", "So she waited to receive your gift before mentioning the \u201cmisunderstanding\u201d \nShe\u2019s full of crap, don\u2019t go and definitely get the gift back. NTA", "I was leaning towards NTA, bc she does have a bit of a point about you being to young but then I read there are other guests still going that are also under 21, so NTA, she\u2019s basically saying she doesn\u2019t want you for the party and is probably only inviting you as a formality.", "NTA", "ESH. She shouldn\u2019t have uninvited you from part of the wedding after you received the full invitation, and really there doesn\u2019t seem to be a decent reason why you shouldn\u2019t attend the reception. \n\nBut you shouldn\u2019t ask for the gift back because of that. The gift is in support of two people you love starting their life together, it\u2019s not an exchange for your attendance. It\u2019s common to send a gift even if you aren\u2019t attending the wedding at all. \n\n(Edit: spacing)", "Yeah, obviously you're an AH. You're communicating \"I didn't actually buy you a gift  because I wish you well in your marriage or care about you as family. I saw it as my admission ticket to a party.\" Way to make the family relationship transactional.\n\nIt's understandable that they have concerns about having people legally prohibited from drinking at a party with a lot of alcohol. In some ways, that's responsible.\n\n*But,* her communication sucked. So ESH", "I'm going to go against popular opinion here and say YTA. \n\nYour cousin is definitely TA for uninviting you to the reception. No qualms there. \n\nBut weddings aren't *supposed* to be transactional like that. You should give the gift because you want to, not as payment for attending the wedding. And is this really the hill you want to die on? Are you willing to risk having a family rift over a set of plates and a reception?  \n\nAgreed, there is something going on here and like I said, cousin is TA, but OP has the chance to be the bigger person, the mature person. I'd take that over a set of plates.", "[deleted]", "[deleted]", "ESH for demanding the plates back and throwing a fit about not being able to attend a single part where you can't legally partake. Could you go, yes, BUT have you considered that if someone were to suspect them of supplying you alcohol, they could get into trouble? No, probably not, because you are making a scene about your own feelings and not considering that its her party and responsibility. You are invited to the better part of the celebration, be happy that you were invited at all. This is supposed to be a celebration of their life milestone, not a transactional party where you exchange a gift for a drink. Plus, she even called you to talk, and it sounds like she was fairly reasonable about it.\n\nEdit, changed to esh because of bride inviting other kids just not you. Although I do wonder if there is more context to this. Like does she suspect you would drink and sis would not? Idk. Still an AH move on the brides part.", "YTA. Once you give a gift, it's no longer yours to dictate what is done with it. It doesn't sound like you are very close to your cousin if you are basing the level of your gift giving on how much you'll be getting back in return. A wedding gift should be a sign of well wishing and not a transactional exchange where you anticipate a return on your investment.\n\n\nIn addition, some venues require their guests to be 21+ if drinking is involved. That may not be the case here, but if the bar area is smaller they may have been asked by the venue management to limit the number of guests. \n\nI wouldn't mention it again.

So yes, if the bride uninvites you from the only part of the wedding that's really worth showing up for (The giant party with friends and relatives), then yes, OP has EVERY RIGHT to ask for her gift back(especially when she finds out others younger than her expect to go). And this is backed up by multiple advice and etiquette columnists because guests finding out the bride and groom have some weird rule or expectation that makes the guest cancel is not uncommon.

You're not giving them something in order to get to come to the wedding, but rather in celebration of their union and to prepare the married couple for their new lives together. It's tradition that everyone who attends a wedding gives a gift, but that doesn't mean that someone who isn't going to be there won't do so.\n\nYour cousin is wrong for going down this path, for sure. It's clear that they're picking and choosing who should attend the reception, which is odd and very graceless, particularly since she's informing people of this after the fact. It absolutely shows you that she does not respect your time and relationship to her. Even if she does have venue restrictions that mean she has to make changes, it's on her and her fianc\u00e9 to reach out and explain the changes they're having to make and to apologise to you for having to do so. Lying about age restrictions while other people younger than you are going to be there is tacky, hurtful, and unnecessary.\n\nThat said, asking for your wedding gift back is gauche. It smacks of a desire for revenge and does not reflect well on you as a person. You are well within your rights to voice your dissatisfaction with how all of this has happened, but asking for a gift to be returned is not the right move in just about any circumstance. You don't have to \"be the bigger person\" and just accept this situation as right; in fact, I think that drawing attention to the shady way this all went down is the correct thing to do. The gift you gave, though, is intended as a reflection of your love and hopes for the future of your cousin's marriage; rescinding that gift is not only logistically difficult but is classless bad etiquette. \n\nESH.", "Definitely NTA. 1.

She is kinda of leech bride who wants gift without anything back", "NTA\n\nwell, in general, I don\u2019t think wedding gifts are tit for tat as far as attending the reception. I think her move was tacky. She should have been careful about an invitation she sent out and spent to purchase two cents. A lot of people only invite some people to one part and not the other, but their invitations only mark the part that guest is invited too.\n\nGenerally, I think gifts are returned is the couple called a wedding off. But the couple are still getting married. Normally gifts historically have been to set up a couple for a new life together. Before people started living together, before marriage that is, we often lived in a time where they lived with their families. That\u2019s the community came together to support the couple on the new start in beginning, which is why couples would receive a lot of household items. But to be honest in this day and age, I see very little purpose to actually give those types of gifts anymore. Most of you already have all the living essentials they need having lived on their own for quite some time and even together before marriage. She doesn\u2019t need another set of fancy plates. Just sounds like she\u2019s kind of greedy and trying to update her household items. Also, if I\u2019m in her position, I would not be making my 20 year old family member, any status, send me a gift that sounds expensive. That\u2019s absolutely ridiculous. You\u2019re in college or just starting out in life. Both of which do not mean you have excessive amount of money to give a couple. In my opinion, no one needs a set of royal something plates from their young family member \n\nHonestly, I just think somethings fishy is going on. If she\u2019s inviting other people who are your age and younger to the reception as well. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair. I guess you know know where you stand with her. I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ll ever get that gift back. You could challenge the charge on the credit card. And at your age, I would understand why the reception, for you would be the most interesting part rather than the actual ceremony.

It is not at all acceptable to go the other way around. And certainly not after having sent invitations that detail both.", "NTA. OP, it sounds like your cousin has decided to turn the reception into a giant party with only their friends verses close family.

Is the groom making similar uncomfortable phone calls to his cousins?", "I figured she just wasn't clear on the invite that the post-party is considered the exception and she only wants the people there that she knows like to party (including the underage ones, so she probably disinvited anybody who would spoil the underage fun or just spoil the fun for her in general)", "This is exactly what I thought!", "NTA - just like \u201cno one takes gifts back\u201d \u2026 \u201cno one takes invites back\u201d Yours was reactive to her own actions. Fair play. I think it was a dirty and classless move on her part, no matter the reason and I can\u2019t imagine it\u2019s a great one if the best she can come up with is \u201cyour too young\u201d despite another cousin of similar age still being allowed at the reception. \n\n\u201cIm good enough for a gift but not the reception\u201d therefore she is not good enough for the gift imo. It truly sounds like she invited you and others ie your parents so she could get more gifts but she didn\u2019t want to spend money on you guys", "NTA. This gold-digger cousin of yours likely just wanted a quick gift grab. She could mature up and give you back the gift \u2014 instead she\u2019s acting like a child about it. I saw your edit and now you know shes full of shit. I\u2019d recommend sending the link to this post to everyone in the family. You have to defend yourself anyways since she went crying to them; you won\u2019t be stirring the pot by texting everyone the link to this. Let them read the responses and see Isabelle\u2019s true colors", "NTA at all & you should show your cousin this post. I'd also be calling her out for her hypocrisy in the manner in which she disinvited you & your parents. I'd straight up tell her \"I called my mom to see if I they'd purchased a gift yet to avoid you having to return my gift, figuring it could be from my parents instead. However she informed me that you also disinvited them from the reception as well. While I'm not going call everyone on your guest list to see whoever was uninvited from your reception, it's clear there's others too. FYI - While I get it's tacky to ask for a gift back, it's even tackier to not address your invites correctly, then disinvite those you don't want at your reception AFTER receiving said gifts.\"", "It might be too difficult to get the plates back. Have your parents gift be half of the plate set and tell her since she uninvited you from half the wedding you are giving her half of a gift (your parents giving the other half since they are also only invited to half the wedding).", "NTA - You are not a child", "NTA! If she was going to restrict certain guests to only certain parts of her wedding then the inventions sent to people with restricted access should have had a separate note included in the invite. When my sister sent out invites, she had a nicely worded note included in the invitations of people with children telling them kids weren\u2019t allowed, she understood if that meant they couldn\u2019t come and no hard feelings. That way they could know before they RSVP and/or spend money on a gift. She is being shady and using you for a gift. I say, make it a gift from your whole family (if she refuses to return it) and now you know her true colors.", "I\u2019m genuinely confused on what she was doing and thinking. \n\nNTA and I\u2019m sorry your cousin is doing this.", "Your cousin is a AH. Yikes definitely call her out. I wouldn't even go to the wedding.", "Nta, old enough to buy an expensive gift but not old enough to come to the fun party? Let's all be real, the reception is the ACTUAL reason to go to a wedding anyways.", "NTA it wasn\u2019t polite for Isabelle to uninvite you for the reception, I\u2019m not sure you should worry about being rude for your response.", "NTA, I hope you can split the cost of the gift with your parents if she won't return it. Then you should permanently cut contact with this cheap ass cousin.", "The reception hall is probably more expensive per head", "This is the only response that makes sense.", "ESH. Perfectly said.", "Yeah, that something else being that Isabelle just doesn't want OP's family at the reception at all.\n\nAfter her edit, her parents got uninvited too.", "And op\u2019s parents are uninvited because they\u2019re too old. Bride is unhinged", "The fact that there are guests younger than you in fact her sister is 19 and gonna be there but you can't attend I would def asked for my gift back you're definitely not the Ah at all not even close", "Right? Dinner is the expensive part. My extended family is huge (and mostly catholic) so everyone can attend the church service, the dinner is smallish and the reception is when everyone you barely know comes.", "Lol not defending the bride but wonder if funds had to do with it or if it was really the brides lack of class.\n\n OP  NTA", "Yes, OP. Just tell OP it\u2019s OK, you\u2019ll be old enough to attend the reception and drink at her NEXT wedding. NTA.", "I\u2019m 21 and I don\u2019t think I could get two plants for someone! They are very kind to do so, the bride doesn\u2019t deserve that", "I\u2019d go with lack of class.", "This, I can't understand.  Why does it matter?  If do, it's rather stupid.", "Yeah, you\u2019re right; I misread that. Wack.", "One of my comments got deleted because it was referring to a certain room, which can not be named any more :("]}
