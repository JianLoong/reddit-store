I chose a set of Royal Albert plates from the gift registry and they've already been delivered.\n\nThe invitation said the ceremony would be first, followed immediately by meals and guests would start making their way to the reception hall. Invitation also said to \"be prepared for a night of drinking and dancing\" at the reception.\n\nA couple of days ago Isabelle called me, we made some small talk. She then said she wanted to call just to confirm I knew the reception was more for partying, and it isn't really suitable for me considering I'm not even 21. I said I'm fine drinking water and soda, but she replied the capacity for the reception hall is smaller so they're not including younger guests. Mind you this is a child free wedding so there isn't really any \"younger\" guests, I get not wanting to have kids around for the reception.\n\nIsabelle said I'm invited to the ceremony and dinner. I was confused and told her this is really weird, the invitation said ceremony and reception. She replied she's sorry for the misunderstanding but it said there would be drinking and stuff.\n\nEventually I told her okay, I respect that but if she could kindly send the plates back so I can get a refund. Isabelle asked why because I'm going to be there for the most important part and they've included me in the catering. I said I was expecting to attend the entire wedding, not half and I bought the gift based on that. I might not attend at all now, so she needs to send the plates back and I'll decide another suitable gift, if any.\n\nShe said no one takes back gifts and it's not like I'm uninvited, if I don't want to come now that's on me and I've already gotten the gift.\n\nI also got a text from my other cousin (Isabelle's sister) that I'm making a scene (she's 19 by the way and attending the reception. I know another cousin the same age is me is attending the reception), and I think Isabelle's talked to other relatives about it. My fiance thinks I'm okay though. So was I the AH asking to return the plates?\n\n**Edit- I have a small update. I just got off the phone with my mom because I wanted to ask her if they'd picked a gift for Isabelle yet, otherwise they can potentially take mine and the whole situation. She said Isabelle called her** ***also*** **and said they're welcome to the ceremony, but the reception is more for friends and partying. My parents are definitely above 21 and they also had ceremony and reception on their invitation.**\n\n**Parents were planning to gift money so they haven't given it yet. They think it was really rude of Isabelle to invite then uninvite, and they might attend the ceremony but not sure. And I am officially confusion. Why not just have ceremony on our invitations in the first place??**", "created_utc": 1671187778, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/znbv4h/aita_for_asking_my_cousin_for_the_wedding_gift/", "score": 1677, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You were uninvited. Ofcourse you're free to request your gift back.  Classy? Probably not but that's not the brides theme anyways.", "NTA. She is disrespecting you. Your are an adult, not a child. And her sister who is younger than you is going.", "NTA.\n\nYou can go to a party and not drink. Kids are allowed in restaurants which have bars. High school dances have people dancing without drinking. If you are being treated like a minor, you are allowed to act childish.", "NTA. She doesnt want you there, no matter the excuse. Either she can invite you to the reception or give the plates back. Unfortunately though, neither will probably happen. I would suggest cutting your losses and not going at all. I hope her plates are broken when she opens the box.", "NTA , if she didn't want younger aged people during reception then she should have informed you before but she didn't. U gave the gift on the basis that ur attending the whole wedding, since she can suddenly uninvite u from reception then u can also ask for ur gift back. \n \nTo be honest, I feel lyk she wanted the gift before rejecting u.\ud83d\ude02 (Sry coz i always think of the worst reasons for things happening) But whatever it is u r absolutely right in wanting ur gift back. But ur relationship with her might be damaged so be ready for that. I don't even think she thinks much of the relationship between you and her since she is uninviting u from reception by not giving a proper reason other than ur age and also acting salty abt returning the gift.", "The bit about not being able to drink is just her cover. She admits that what really happened is that she invited too many people and the venue needs her to trim it down. It\u2019s probably a fire code violation. The other D-list guests are probably getting the same speech, but with a different reason behind it.\n\nOn wedding discussion forums you always get gimme pigs giving advice about inviting people you\u2019re not close to because they\u2019ll probably send a gift in lieu of attending. She was hoping you would do that, and when you didn\u2019t she tried to force your hand. She just didn\u2019t expect you to thwart her plan so directly. \n\nShe\u2019s not treating you like a beloved family member, so you\u2019re NTA for not behaving like one.\n\nI don\u2019t think you\u2019re going to get that gift back, so I\u2019d give up on that, but asking was the right move. I also think you should skip the wedding entirely. No wedding food is good enough to make up for a slight like that.\n\nBe prepared for a lot of family members to have a lot of thoughts on this.", "NTA, unless your cousin is planning for an orgy for her wedding reception, I don't see why a 20 year old is not invited. Looks like she's just making up an excuse to keep you out and you are right to ask for your gift back as it feels like you are not part of the entire wedding. You are right in not wanting to attend it if you dont want to as its kind of insulting to be called a kid at 20 when people could join the army at 18.", "NTA - she should have clarified this with you upon sending the invitation, not after. And in general, you are 20, not 17. She should at most approached you to ensure you would not partake in underage drinking, not ban you from the party. There were many ways of dealing with this situation and she chose a wrong one. I've never heard of being \"partially\" invited to a wedding ceremony and would also have been offended. There's many ways to \"hide\" the crazy partying from guests you might not comfortable partying around (like having an \"after party\" or a \"fake ending\"). But not clearly telling someone - okay, now we want to go wild so please excuse yourself.", "I'll go NTA on this one. She is effectively uninviting you and making you feel unwelcome. Even if you are technically allowed to attend the ceremony and dinner (lol at her using the \"most important part\" justification), that whole experience will be tainted by the upcoming point where they throw you out but not those 21+.  You aren't a full guest, you are justified in your demanding the gift back.\n\nAlso, why the fuck does it matter if 18-20's are dancing with the other adults? Are bartenders not capable of checking IDs and giving out wristbands? That's their job that every state in the US requires them to do by law. (I am guessing you are in the US because of the 21 for alcohol cutoff you mentioned).", "I understand why you are hurt. And the bride is lacking in compassion and a poor communicator at best. Gifts aren\u2019t payment for a wedding but a sentiment / support of the relationship. I am going with NTA because I understand where you are coming from. \n\nPersonally, I wouldn\u2019t attend the wedding and \u201cpoorly communicate\u201d your intentions. This would force her to \u201cpay for your plate\u201d that no one will eat. But I\u2019m petty like that. \ud83d\ude06", "NTA\n\nYou never uninvite people because of numbers who have already accepted, also the age is clearly false due to the 19 year old still getting to go.\n\nThe real answer is 'I want to prioritise other people and don't value your attendance' to which asking for the gift back is petty but understandable.", "NTA. Funny though, she considers you old enough to be taking a full fledged gift from you, but you are not old enough to be included in reception party. Lol.\n\nEDIT: so based on your edits, it is now clear that Isabella doesn't want family at her party, and they are just for gift- grabbing. A decent thing would have been to maintain that upfront, but she seems no class act.", "NTA\n\n\nYou are NOT a child of you can vote. What a pathetic excuse.\n\n\nLet them keep the gift. Ditch the wedding. Think twice about being a friend to her in the diet place.", "Nta. I would normally say asking for a gift back is extremely rude. However, the circumstances here make it totally ok. Sending someone a FULL invite, and then waiting for them to send you a gift, and then kicking them out of the actual celebration is a form of grifting, in my opinion. Her using your age is an excuse, and a bad one at that.", "NTA but Isabelle is. So no younger guest unless its her sister and a cousin she really likes, both of whom are younger then you. \n\nThe invitation was for the entire event, you accepted and chose a present based on that, that was the social contract you entered into with her. She has now broken that contract so yeah, she needs tonreturn the gift.", "NTA\n\nIf she\u2019s having a wedding, it\u2019s her responsibility to be in charge of making sure everything is communicated correctly. Her leaving this bit of communication out also showcases that you could potentially be an afterthought.\nThat aside, the way she went about communicating it to you is really disrespectful. By this point, if I were in her position, I would just personally acknowledge my error in communication and make sure there\u2019s accommodation at the reception for underage guests, as they shouldn\u2019t have to pay for my mistake in planning.\nExpecting you to accommodate for HER error shows how unwelcoming she is towards you at this wedding. I honestly don\u2019t blame you for wanting a refund, and honestly if you don\u2019t even go that\u2019s understandable, as well.\n\nEDIT: thought it through some more and changed opinion", "NTA but you should know better now to bring any gift for her and her family along with you to the event.", "NTA, but you ain't ever going to get those plates back", "NTA I'd ask why others your age are allowed but not you", "So you're old enough to send gifts but not old enough to attend party? NTA", "NTA, Isabella waited until she received your $160 gift to disinvite you from her reception while allowing others your age to attend. \n\nHad she done so before receiving your gift or offered to reimburse you for the gift then I would understand. But she chose to wait until she got the goods to uninvite you. \n\nShe comes across as a user right now.", "NTA\n\nTell someone else going to claim your gift so she doesn\u2019t get extra. I\u2019m petty like that .", "NTA. If you're too young for the reception you're too young for buying gifts.\n\nMake her a cute drawing she can hang on the fridge.", "NTA, she\u2019s changed the deal why cant you ?", "NTA, i don't even know how to find the right words, the audacity", "Nta your cousin is beyond rude. You don\u2019t only invite people to the ceremony", "NTA", "So she waited to receive your gift before mentioning the \u201cmisunderstanding\u201d \nShe\u2019s full of crap, don\u2019t go and definitely get the gift back. NTA", "I was leaning towards NTA, bc she does have a bit of a point about you being to young but then I read there are other guests still going that are also under 21, so NTA, she\u2019s basically saying she doesn\u2019t want you for the party and is probably only inviting you as a formality.", "NTA", "ESH. She shouldn\u2019t have uninvited you from part of the wedding after you received the full invitation, and really there doesn\u2019t seem to be a decent reason why you shouldn\u2019t attend the reception. \n\nBut you shouldn\u2019t ask for the gift back because of that. The gift is in support of two people you love starting their life together, it\u2019s not an exchange for your attendance. It\u2019s common to send a gift even if you aren\u2019t attending the wedding at all. \n\n(Edit: spacing)", "Yeah, obviously you're an AH. You're communicating \"I didn't actually buy you a gift  because I wish you well in your marriage or care about you as family. I saw it as my admission ticket to a party.\" Way to make the family relationship transactional.\n\nIt's understandable that they have concerns about having people legally prohibited from drinking at a party with a lot of alcohol. In some ways, that's responsible.\n\n*But,* her communication sucked. So ESH", "I'm going to go against popular opinion here and say YTA. \n\nYour cousin is definitely TA for uninviting you to the reception. No qualms there. \n\nBut weddings aren't *supposed* to be transactional like that. You should give the gift because you want to, not as payment for attending the wedding. And is this really the hill you want to die on? Are you willing to risk having a family rift over a set of plates and a reception?  \n\nAgreed, there is something going on here and like I said, cousin is TA, but OP has the chance to be the bigger person, the mature person. I'd take that over a set of plates.", "[deleted]", "[deleted]", "ESH for demanding the plates back and throwing a fit about not being able to attend a single part where you can't legally partake. Could you go, yes, BUT have you considered that if someone were to suspect them of supplying you alcohol, they could get into trouble? No, probably not, because you are making a scene about your own feelings and not considering that its her party and responsibility. You are invited to the better part of the celebration, be happy that you were invited at all. This is supposed to be a celebration of their life milestone, not a transactional party where you exchange a gift for a drink. Plus, she even called you to talk, and it sounds like she was fairly reasonable about it.\n\nEdit, changed to esh because of bride inviting other kids just not you. Although I do wonder if there is more context to this. Like does she suspect you would drink and sis would not? Idk. Still an AH move on the brides part.", "YTA. Once you give a gift, it's no longer yours to dictate what is done with it. It doesn't sound like you are very close to your cousin if you are basing the level of your gift giving on how much you'll be getting back in return. A wedding gift should be a sign of well wishing and not a transactional exchange where you anticipate a return on your investment.\n\n\nIn addition, some venues require their guests to be 21+ if drinking is involved. That may not be the case here, but if the bar area is smaller they may have been asked by the venue management to limit the number of guests. \n\nI wouldn't mention it again.

Those run about $40 per plate - so even if she only bought 4, that's still $160 - which is a LOT for a 20 year old.", "Agreed", "You\u2019re right, it\u2019s very British and old school American. As I understand it, it was to keep from making work for the family, having to transport gift boxes and be sure they arrived safely. And I guess they\u2019d also hire private security to ensure valuables and cash didn\u2019t walk. Anyway, we don\u2019t keep to a lot of old standards when they become obsolete, but that one I do, since I feel it puts a lot of burden on the recipient. But I think most weddings have a gift table and a card box anyway, because there will always be a need.", "she said her original invitation said reception, not sure why ur bending the story", "Yeah, if that\u2019s what you took from OP\u2019s comment then I don\u2019t think you\u2019ve got much room to talk. OP is using her upcoming marriage as a point of reference; She\u2019s not a child, she doesn\u2019t require babysitting because she\u2019s a young adult woman, and doesn\u2019t need anyone caring after her because she doesn\u2019t drink. Not once did OP use her marriage as an equivalence to maturity.", ">after dinner is the drinking party. *and Dancing, which is traditionally the reception so stop saying she's not uninvited to the reception.*\n\nBut as you've yelled at the OP repeatedly the gift \"Isn't payment for the wedding/meal\" So OP feeling offended that she was the only underage **adult** not invited to the actual party part of the wedding and asking for her gift back saying she'll probably not go now is her **right!**\n\nHonestly it sounds like you've pulled a similar move to the bride or that you ARE the bride in question.", "Can\u2019t you read?", "Our open bar was less than 1/5 the cost of the food portion of our catering for a 150 person wedding.", "I dont think it does, we just got a lot of quotes for venues, open bar or not drinks are usually much less per person vs the meal. Wedding catering is EXPENSIVE.", "I mean I always look forward to the food the most?", "Let her know that if she sells the plates it covers your expenses of not attending.", "I am confused were you originally invited to the meal part then uninvited? This just seems really weird...", "She was uninvited to the party part. The cousin called to let her know she was only invited to the ceremony and the meal part.", "Not if they initially invited you to everything and later rescinded part of the invitation", "Not everyone is ok being used for a gift or acting as a doormat.", "Aren't you the bride? \ud83e\udd14", "> I also got a text from my other cousin (Isabelle's sister) that I'm making a scene (she's 19 by the way and attending the reception. I know another cousin the same age is me is attending the reception),\n\nliterally in the post but okay", "But let her come to the ceremony, then let security stop her from the reception. Keep the gift though", "That\u2019s fine! This is *just my opinion*. And for what it\u2019s worth: I agree the bride is an AH for this! I just think OP has a chance to walk away without making things worse. She doesn\u2019t have to. It would be understandable if she didn\u2019t. But I would let it go.", "Lol, definitely not. I already said the bride is an AH for what she did, and it\u2019s certainly not fair to OP. But two wrongs don\u2019t make a right. The bride already did her damage, OP can be the bigger person & let it go.", "They clearly just wanted to start shit. Clearly they can't read otherwise they would have stopped already.", "I'm not sure where you said anything \"nicely\". You kinda throw digs in for no real reason.", "Right, and thousands and thousands of people will actually disagree with you. Read etiquette columns, they pretty much all agree, if you are uninvited or don't go to a wedding there is Zero obligation for a gift and the whole point of wedding gifts is to give the newlyweds a leg up on their life together and to *compensate* for the giant expensive party they(or their families) just threw. So yes, if the bride uninvites you from the only part of the wedding that's really worth showing up for (The giant party with friends and relatives), then yes, OP has EVERY RIGHT to ask for her gift back(especially when she finds out others younger than her expect to go). And this is backed up by multiple advice and etiquette columnists because guests finding out the bride and groom have some weird rule or expectation that makes the guest cancel is not uncommon. So stop screaming she has no right to ask for the gift back because **SHE HAS EVERY RIGHT TO ASK FOR THE GIFT BACK WHEN DESRESPECTED BY THE BRIDE. NTA OP**", "She's pissed that the fancy dishes are getting returned.", "I think we found OPs cousins", "LOL I was also like hmmm is that the cousin? She\u2019s big mad and tacky lol."]}
