{"id": 26421, "submission_id": "16cuui0", "title": "AITA for telling my mum I don't want her dog at my wedding?", "selftext": "Me and my partner are at the stage where we've been discussing getting married and how we'd want the wedding to go (location, colour scheme etc. General wedding planning stuff!). I'm very close with my mum so was excitedly telling her about our ideas, to which she said that she couldn't wait to see her dog amongst the guests. I was reluctant to agree to this, as her dog is not trained (he is toilet trained but has bad separation anxiety and bites feet) so I know he would cause problems for everyone at the wedding.\n\nI ran it past my partner, and he agreed with me that having the dog at the wedding wouldn't be a good idea. I spoke to my mum about it and told her that both of us are uncomfortable about her bringing the dog, and in response she got uncomfortable because she's unwilling to pay for a dog sitter (she normally leaves the dog with her own mum when she needs to be out of the house for appointments) and that I couldn't tell my grandma she couldn't come to the wedding because she had to look after the dog instead, which I wasn't intending on doing anyway, as I obviously want my grandma to attend.\n\nI feel somewhat in the wrong because even though it's mainly a day for my partner and I, I don't want any drama leading up to or on the day of the wedding. \n\nI have autism, so boundaries are hard for me to set without feeling guilty; I know I have to be firm with her, but I'm unsure how to go about it without feeling even more guilty for telling her no in the first place and I feel quite cruel about this.\n\nETA: For extra context which I realised might be beneficial(?), my mum also has a really unhealthy relationship with her dog and honestly views him more as a human baby than a pet dog, so she takes any \"negative\" view on him as a personal attack \n\nTLDR: Mum wants her dog at my wedding but both me and my partner don't want him there because he isn't trained", "created_utc": 1694130955, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16cuui0/aita_for_telling_my_mum_i_dont_want_her_dog_at_my/", "score": 18, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The dog bites at feet. That sounds like a lawsuit waiting to happen.", "NTA it's crazy to bring a pet to a wedding and dog sitters are cheap. Maybe offer to pay for a sitter if you feel bad but I would hold firm and say no dogs at the wedding", "The dog bites. That alone is a problem. I wouldn\u2019t think most venues would even allow that as it\u2019s a liability all around\u2026", "This is your wedding.  I would not budge on this if I were you.  Explain to your mom that she will have to make a choice.  Her actual \"baby\" is getting married and her dog cannot attend.  There is no way to sugar coat this.  \"Mom, I want and need you at my wedding.  Fluffy will be just fine with a sitter for the duration of the wedding.  I do not want Fluffy at the wedding and he cannot come.  I hope you decide to come and join in the big day.\"  Then leave it at that.  It's her choice.  NTA", "NTA. Your wedding, your rules. She can pay for a dog sitter, it's only for one day and an important one. Her dog is her responsability and usually, dogs are not invited to weddings.", "NTA - If she were blind and that were a service dog, thing might be different. However, that's not the case. The dog is her PET, and pets are never invited to weddings. If your mom has a problem with that, it shows that she cares more about an animal than her own actual child. Your mom sounds very toxic.", "NTA for a completely reasonable stance.\n\nChild-free weddings aren't rare, though they're less common than child-allowed.\n\nDog-free weddings are extremely common. It's a dogs-allowed wedding that's really rare (service dogs excepted). Your venue is likely to not allow non-service dogs.", "NTA a dog isn\u2019t entitled to be at a wedding.", "NTA \n\nThat is a disaster waiting to happen. What if dog bites someone? A dog with anxiety will not do good with crowds. Will the venue even allow nonservice dogs to be there, especially one with a bite history? \n\nShe can stay home or get dog sitter for one day. \n\nThe only compromise I would allow is that dog must be muzzled and wearing a red vest that warns of bites. Dog must be double tethered with leash around your moms waist. Dog and mom will be separated by at least 10 feet from everyone else in tge very back.", "NTA\n\nYour wedding, your rules, and if it's likely the dog might assault your guests, then that's a super-extra reason to keep him far away.\n\nI know it can be hard to tell a parent that they can't have everything they want, but you and your partner are both on the same page, so take strength from that.", "Weddings  are no place for a dog. If not allowing the dkh at your wedding is going to cause issues for you k not your mom] offer to pay fit the dog sitter. I personally would not, but I do not have autism. Do what makes you feel good.", "NTA it\u2019s a mutt, not a human and it\u2019s a wedding not some picnic at a park. Who tf brings their dog to a wedding? Too weird.", "NTA: your wedding, your rules.\n\nplus you mentioned yourself that the dog is not trained.", "NTA - Your wedding, your rules.  Pay for a sitter for Mom's dog.  You can find a really good one in time as many will allow for a meet and greet to make sure both dog and sitter get along well.", "NTA. No one brings dogs to weddings that is fairly obvious and well understood most venues probably wouldn\u2019t allow it either. You shouldn\u2019t feel bad about this she has ample time to make arrangements.", "NTA. It\u2019s not a service dog, it doesn\u2019t need to be there.", "NTA. I\u2019ve only been to one wedding where someone brought a pet, who was leashed the whole time and very well behaved, so it\u2019s definitely not a normal occurrence. \n\nLucky, most venues will not allow pets, so you can always blame them.", "NTA. Our venue told us that dogs are allowed there. We didn't tell a soul because my sister would have brought hers. My cousin didn't come to my wedding because he can't be without his dog. He won't even visit his own parents because of it. It's ridiculous to have an issue with going to your child's wedding because you don't want to hire a Rover sitter for a few hours.", "Tell mom to stay at home with her dog. NTA.", "Unless the dog is needed for a disability I say you're NTA.", "NTA\n\nGenerally dogs don't attend weddings and it's very strange that your mum intended to bring hers like it's something everyone does.\n\nI can see it being disruptive during the ceremony and, if it's anything like the dogs I know, will probably be bothering guests for food during the reception, eat something it really shouldn't and end the night at the vets.", "NTA tell her your terrified that the dog will get overwhelmed and nip someone. If this happens, then the dog is deemed dangerous and euthanized.  \nOh and wtf is it with people taking pets to weddings, it\u2019s attention seeking, and will get her gossiped about. She should just wear a wedding dress", "NTA. Find a venue where no pets are allowed so you can blame it on them when the time comes.", "The dog bites feet?! Do you want to be liable for that crap? \n\nNTA.", "Sheesh, my dogs don't bite and I wouldn't assume they could go to one!", "If the dog is equal to a human to her, it obviously can\u2019t come without an invite.", "NTA\n\nShe needs to start working on a sitter or two now.\n\nPlenty of time to get it into training and form bonds", "That's a good idea actually! Thank you :)", "Exactly my concern! I'd hate for anyone to be hurt by him, especially when he isn't even my responsibility", "Also, service dogs don't bite feet \ud83d\udc3e", "I know you want to be kind to your mom about this...I wonder if the venue has a rule against dogs being allowed (unless they are certified service dogs). Maybe that angle might help persuade your mom to hire a sitter?", "Or maybe that angle would cause the mom to get one of those online fake \"certifications\" for her \"service dog\". Then show up at the wedding: \"You *have to* let me in! It's *the law!*\""]}
