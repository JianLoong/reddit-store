But I'll tell you what: if S sincerely apologizes for her past comments, starts trying to make it up to B, and proves that she has committed to making a real behavior change (e.g. by being on good behavior towards B and B's friend for at least the next 6 months), I will consider including her the next time an opportunity like this comes up.\"\n\nNTA.

Their parents go to bat for them to get things they haven't earned or don't deserve. No one deserves Taylor Swift tickets from their aunt! It's a gift. Not a right. Ridiculous.

Perhaps slightly TA when you got a 3rd ticket and still didn't offer to take S.  If all of the bullying is truly as one sided as the post describes, then NTA regardless of the number of tix available.  S's mom is definitely an AH so it's easy to see why her daughter might act like an entitled brat. S is still very young and it'd be great if some adult exposes her to other ways to behave but you're not at all obligated to be that person.", "You know what kids are like, especially so close in age. Being excluded hurts even when its still fair and square. \n\nYou should have found someone else. \n\nNAH", "Gotta disagree with all the comments here, YTA. You know your neice is a huge fan and you went out of your way not to invite her even after you'd procured an extra ticket. Did you consider that maybe taking the girls out on a night together would mend fences with them and help with the school situation? You are  bullying your neice. And you're not a high schooler. Your neice is probably going to get more bullied for this because your other neice is pissed off about the situation. You don't say how she found out, but it's likely your neice was bragging about it, in other words being a bully herself. In your comments you say that the school doesn't do anything, that's probably because it's much less one sided then you are presenting. Schools take bullying incredibly seriously nowadays, my little sister got a note home from kindergarten because she got into a fight with another kid about whose tissue was bigger. \n\nI also get the feeling that your neice may be antagonistic to the other because the adults in her extended have decided she's awful and now treat her like gum under your shoe.", "NTA- This is what her daughter gets for being a bully. She gets to not be gifted an expensive concert ticket. Surely such harsh punishments cannot be legal, I swoon! Oh that she must see someone she enjoys making miserable be happy! The damage may be permanent! Alas!", "Completely in the loop from the get go. I originally wanted him to take the ticket, but he wasn't interested, and then I suggested taking B which he was all for. He also saw the way that S and her friend were treating B at the lake and was also horrified.\n\nETA: Should have added, he was also the one who suggested trying to swap the tickets so B could bring her friend. (Because I'm old and boring, he said, lol).", "Honestly I think the bullying is worse then I described. If S and her friend's felt comfortable treating B and her friend like that with adults around, I fully believe B when she discloses to me what happens when there's no supervision. This has been an ongoing thing with the school, and B has also shown me tiktoks these girls have made making fun of others at the school as well. B's parents are desperately trying to get her into another school for next year and even looking at home schooling for the rest of Middle until highschool. I've seen B's mom cry over the school administration seeming to not care one bit about what is happening.", "Cool, then totally NTA to me. \n\nI understand it's you expressing some kind of \"favoritism,\" but one of those kids is a bully and the other is getting left out. You're treating them different based on having different personalities and different needs, this seems fine to me. \n\nIt's wild to me that S's mom feels entitled to you doing special things for her daughter when she could simply take her herself.", ">he was also the one who suggested trying to swap the tickets so B could bring her friend.

And earlier today when she was blowing up his phone also explained that part of the reason S can't go with them is that she's bullied B and her friend in the past so why should she hang out with them now? He did not mention that we'd asked B about S potentially coming because he didn't want that to then get back to S and cause more trouble for B. \n\nShe should also be fully aware since she's gotten phone calls from the school, and B's mom (her sister) has basically begged her in the past to talk to S about it.\nThey used to be the two closest sisters in the family and the past year's issues has totally fractured that, so this definitely shouldn't be coming out of left field.", "Makes sense. Some parents try hard to stop bullying but their kids are just AHs, and other parents sweep it under the rug.\n\nIf you have a good relationship with S, she's probably old enough at 13 to talk directly with and just ignore the mom?
