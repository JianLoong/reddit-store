But they are definitely not as heavy as people think. A little 18 cu ft fridge can easily be moved by one person. One of the big 32 cu ft French doors with a built-in monitor is a little different. But even that could be handled easily by two people and an appliance dolly.", "Are you delusional? She called someone lazy for not being able to lift something heavier than she is.", "Furniture and appliance movers wear booties. The electrician installing an electrical outlet in a finished bedroom could go either way (booties or socks) I leave it up to them.", "The people doing that are actually violating labour laws. We are SUPPOSED to wear CSA work boots at all times on the worksite. If our job requires us entering someones residence, their residence is our worksite and we SHOULD be wearing boots. Depending on the work being done, lots of people will take their boots off as a courtesy and because they know its unlikely to be injured due to a lack of boots", "We definitely don't", "It was 1931-1938 you imbecile", "He got told off didn\u2019t he?", "Did you read her comment? It was critiquing her weaponized incompetence. And the fact that it degrades women. I'm not sure why people think women are too handicapped to use tools? Do you think a small man would not try to contribute to a move? Even little children are eager to help. There has been much discussion about dollies and straps, both great suggestions. Obv her husband is an asshole, but being a smol bean is not an excuse to bow out. All hands are precious when it comes to moving heavy items *as a group.*", "I mean, if we're all being reasonable and fair, neither of them were :p in situations like this it just comes down to who's feelings and opinions on the matter align with the most people. I could see it being one way or the other honestly, and the fact is there will always be a small percentage of weird people in _any_ time period.. However, we'd do well to remember that they _are_ weird because that's how the majority of the rest of us {rightly} view them. \n\nIn these types of situations it's important we check ourselves and make sure that, despite how we feel, that we don't find ourselves arguing the exception as if it is the rule.. with that in mind it's easy to see why neither of them have been downvoted; they both have a point. Yes, there were people like that back then- almost certainly more than there currently are now.. however, saying that it was so many of them that it was a defining trait of the era is equally disingenuous as saying there were none at all.\n\nAs is often the case with most things, reality sits comfortably in the middle of the two opposing sides.", "Neither of were they???", "I prefer to add \u201csee\u201d to the end of sentences and make them all sound like questions, see? OP just wants to keep his castle free of other men, see?", "Did you read OP's comments across the post? OP DID help. She DID try. And her husband was STILL an asshole. Shut up if you don't know the full story", "\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\udcaf", "I know she helped move the stove, I was happy to hear it. How does what happened have any bearing on your reply to the comment from before? Our thread unraveling from the comment you replied to clearly deviates from the specific situation,it is far more abstract. No need to be so nasty, wtf."]}
