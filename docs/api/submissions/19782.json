I'm about your size and have to move heavy stuff sometimes. Never, ever would I move something as heavy as a fridge without a dolly. Don't care if the other person helping is the hulk. Fridges are freaking heavy and have their center of gravity in the most awkward place. Moving one without the proper tools is stupid and dangerous. \n\nWith a dolly, and a couple ratchet straps, someone our size can move a fridge on our own.

They could easily get help by spending a few bucks, it's not like we're tight on budget, and I wouldn't risk an injury so won't help him. They finally got it done themselves and resented me for a while, but later on mostly didn't ask me again.

Next we are going to see a post my your husband TIFU by asking my petite wife to help me move heavy appliances and lost 3 toes. \n My husband and I are literally laughing so hard, his eyes about popped out of his head when I said refrigerator. I am also small 5\"2\" 125lbs and pretty muscular, I would not attempt to lift a fridge. Then when you add trying to bring them inside the house it gets even more ridiculous now you have to  manage stairs, doorways, furniture etc. I mean if your husband is trying to get a refund from broken appliances by all means have at it but most likely you are going to get hurt trying to lift it or he is going to get hurt trying to catch it when you inevitably drop it.", "NTA for not helping solve a problem your husband is trying to create for no apparent reason. \n\nWhat's your husband's deal with not wanting anyone in the house?

Take the plate off and then lift the fridge back up by myself. Sometimes, I would have to do that four or five times in one shift.
