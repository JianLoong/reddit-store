Well today we had one coming and my husband said he didn\u2019t want anyone coming into the house. He didn\u2019t know the guy bringing them. His mom knows the guy. So I made the comment \u201cwell I\u2019ll just let you handle all that\u201d(I assumed him and the guy would bring them in). He said he was going to need my help. So I asked how I was supposed to help. I\u2019m 90 lbs 5\u20193\u201d\u2026. He said he needed help getting the stuff inside. And that all the weight wouldn\u2019t be on me because when two people lift something it\u2019s not as heavy\u2026.. ummmm I\u2019m the size of a 12 year old girl. How would anyone in their right mind expect someone of my size to lift half of either of these things?! He threw a complete attitude and was a complete asshole about the situation. So AITA? Or are his expectations way too high here? Obviously if they aren\u2019t that heavy I will help. But I don\u2019t see how I can be much help here. Both of these appliances are usually pretty heavy\u2026.\n\n\nEdit: I had no problem helping. I did help move the stove inside. Also for everyone saying we are building a home together so I should help out, I\u2019ve already replaced the entire sub floor, and flooring in the house, alone. Have also replaced a lot of Sheetrock and painted the entire house. No didn\u2019t hang Sheetrock myself but he wasn\u2019t the one who helped. So it\u2019s not about being lazy. It\u2019s about knowing my limits and not wanting to injure myself. The fridge had no wheels. And until the mover got here we didn\u2019t know there would be an appliance dolly. So the mover helped him get it off the bed of the truck and then my husband got it in with the appliance dolly.", "created_utc": 1686865933, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14aelr4/aita_because_i33f_was_surprised_my_husband34m/", "score": 2267, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Is he gonna DIY all home repairs and renovations?", "NTA. He had actual help available and refused to use it like an idiot.

If she tried to help, and wasn't able to, and then her hubs freaked out about it, then she would not be the asshole.\nBut she didn't.\nShe just whined, acted entitled, and then posted about it online to try and validate her seemingly shitty behaviour.\nSo, she is the asshole. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Seriously though.

Dan and I were very much in love. He was my 1st boyfriend, and I was his first girlfriend.  Our feelings were very intense. We had so much fun together. He was super smart, funny, and kind. He died after he dropped me off after a date in a horrific car accident. \n\nHis sudden death devastated me. At first, I was numb, and I felt like I was in a dream state. One that was a horrible mistake and a nightmare I wanted to wake up from. I was in denial. Then came the anger at the unfairness of his death. I was mad at God and well-meaning friends and family who told me Dan was in a better place. They meant well, but I wanted to scream at them to shut the hell up. \n\nAfter his funeral, the grief hit me hard. I would cry a lot. I either couldn't sleep, or I would sleep too much. I couldn't eat. The world felt cold and colorless.  What helped me was making myself get out among people and nature. I started walking, and  5 months after his death, I joined a hiking group. I started hiking and meeting new people. I also joined a grieving group. \n\nThis helped me to slowly start healing. The people I met in this group became my lifeline. They understood what I was feeling. Friends and family would tell me to move on with my life, I was too young, and I should get out there and date again. They were uncomfortable with my grieving.  The group and therapist who ran the group made me realize there isn't a set time for grief. Everyone's journey is different. They allowed me to talk or cry about Dan. \n\nI eventually started to remember Dan more with smiles than tears, but it took time. When I felt like crying, I did. When I was angry, I'd go for a run or hike, or I'd journal. I wrote Dan a lot of letters. When I was alone, I would speak out  loud to him or in my mind. There were times I would have very vivid dreams about him. I called those visitations. \n\nAfter sixteen months, I started to date again.. Eventually, I met my husband, and we fell madly and deeply in love. I never thought I would feel the intense love again like I did with Dan, but I did. We've been married for 37 years now. \n\nYou will get through this. I promise you. I still think of Dan, and I smile when I do. He helped me to realize what love is. And I know one day, I will see him again. Love lives on in our hearts and minds. And I truly know and feel that our loved ones live on after their physical death. We all do.
