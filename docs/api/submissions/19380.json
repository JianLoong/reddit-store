A pocket knife has a zillion uses other than as a weapon. The pepper spray I guess qualifies as a weapon but it's a pretty common self-defense item for people, especially women, to carry.

As long as they are being safe and responsible with it (i e not getting drunk or leaving where someone else can access) then I dont really have a problem with people carrying. OPs bag literally sounds like most big mom purses the women I know carry. My wife has pepper spray and a multi-tool in hers along with who knows what else.", ">As someone from the USA, I read your title and thought, \"Yeah, you don't need to bring your gun to family events\"\n\nI'm not American, but I've reddited enough for that to have been my first thought, too.", "Lol NTA I carry a Coach purse with a very similar cargo. I married an Eagle Scout I tend to be prepared for anything.", "Agreed, this is pretty much my standard female purse.  Add safety pins, of course.", "My first thought was that the OP more or less described what my mother's generation carried in their purse.", "r/usdefaultism", "The pocket knife freakout made me laugh; a pocket knife is most dangerous to *the wielder*. If OP tried to cut/stab somebody with it, they'd probably end up either snapping it closed on their fingers or (if it has a lock) their hand would slide up onto the blade and slice their fingers up.", "I agree - I would love a jerky toting cousin!", "NTA. Seriously, I was thinking the same thing. Maybe it is because I'm an elder millennial and a mom, but I have almost all the same stuff just in my everyday bag. \n\nI used to keep my pocket knife in my bag as well. Nobody ever thought I was going to attack people. If anything, they appreciated it because it was super convenient sometimes. \n\nI only took it out because I kept forgetting about it going through security checkpoints (airports, stadiums, theme parks, etc) and getting it taken away or make the trek back to my car to leave it there (don't always have the time). Now I just have it stashed in my glove box instead. \n\nOP, I highly recommend a pair of socks, and some ziplock baggies as well if you have space.", "My go to response for \"Do you have a knife?\" is \"I've got pants on, don't I?\"", "As long as your knife isn't bigger than mine I'm OK with it.  \n\n Otherwise I'm jealous.", "Also a woman who carries a pocket knife in pocket, as well as one on keyring. I easily use mine once a day, if not more.", "My knife has pink flowers on it. It's cute, and ensures that I get it back if someone needs to use it.", "The other half of us use our \"key claws\" whenever we are walking around outside.", "My sister leaves hers in the car or at home when she is with me. They make me very uncomfortable-I'm a terrible clutz and I have two autistic adult children who get into EVERYTHING in a second.", "But she didn't even have a gun!  It was a pocket knife she was freaking out over.", "If your kidnapping people you don't have any free time.   Captives are so time consuming.", "Yeah I saw this and thought oh how could you be an asshole for bringing your most versatile handheld gaming device, did children fight over it or something?", "No, it means that in the US, also, most people refer to a concealed handgun as a ccw or just concealed carry.  Sometimes a ccw is part of an EDC.", "I think what they are referring to is that in the US, that term is usually applying to a gun, not a backpack.", "Just because there's a subreddit for something doesn't mean it's normal in the real world....\n\nIf I asked my friends what their \"everyday carry\" was it would probably be a wallet, phone, chapstick, and a water bottle. Not a knife and pepper spray and survival gear.", "I misspoke, I could see why they'd  be upset if she were carrying a huge knife on her belt, I didn't mean she'd be wrong for doing it. Being upset because there's a pocket knife in her bag, they're crazy.", "Literally the reason I stopped too!", "I'm a woman, but I always used to carry a (small) pocket knife. I also have ADHD. \n\nFYI, I have gotten my Utili-key through TSA multiple times. Not because I was trying to sneak it through, but because I forgot it was on my key ring, and at a glance, it just looks like one more key, so they never have noticed it. (Knock on wood.)", "I know that feeling.", "I bite my nails, pocket knife is frequently necessary just to open basic things.", "I think I'd rather have a penetrating wound by a knife than a spoon.  Wife threatened to stab me with a spoon once.  I had to think about it for awhile.  I opted to pass on the offer.", "If you think you\u2019re going to be attacked at a family gathering\u2026 IDK\n\nIt\u2019s a setting where people would be rightfully pissed if it got set off accidentally, which seems to be the greater risk here.", "Could also be just the knife. Or a lot of multitools are called that.

And I guarantee most of these people are from the US.  \nSame for the EDC reddit.", "Is it? I carry a gun, am in the US and would not assume that. \n\n\nI have to admit I am a bit biased since I like to browse r/EDC on a daily basis.", "Because those folks would not understand the context it is normally used in.  \nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everyday\\_carry", "most likely not attacked at a family gathering, but depending on the location and time of day, possibly on the way to or from. or maybe during errands before or after. or if it comes out of the bag, not remembering to put it back in.", "Given that no one else at the party seemed to think it was reasonable, I don\u2019t get the impression that it\u2019s a dangerous area. \n\nIf she had any asthmatics, etc in the family, she is putting them at risk for no reason by the sound of it. If the family doesn\u2019t want it there, I think she\u2019s better off listening to the consensus of people who were actually at the party, rather than the hypothetical scenarios of redditors.", "NTA!\n\nI\u2019m female and I take my leatherman skeletool almost everywhere. Have had it for at least 16 years? I use it regularly for a variety of reasons.  It\u2019s amazing. \n\nAlso, I totally have a \u201cgo-bag.\u201d It\u2019s got what I need if I break down in my car, etc. it\u2019s basically a backpack.\n\nPpl are so bizarre sometimes!", "I have one too! I admired my sibling\u2019s Leatherman but said I\u2019d need a smaller one to fit in my purse. So they got me the mini and had it engraved with one of our long-running inside jokes. It\u2019s a great tool to have!"]}
