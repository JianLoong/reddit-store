I'm not crazy into it like on a conspirationist level, but I like to have in my bag or backpack some useful things. I carry everywhere my EDC (EveryDay Carry) set which contains: first aid kit, food (protein bars, chocolate and dried meat) and water, spare t-shirt and underwear, pocket knife, pepper spray (both spray and knife are perfectly legal in my country) and few other useful tools. It proved to be useful on many occasions and I always make sure to resupply this set and have it around me. It's a habit now and I feel really weird, almost like naked, without it.\n\nRecently my family had a big gathering during a barbecue. It was the firs gathering since I was a kid, so there were a lot of family members I barely or not at all knew. Obviously, I had my bag with me (and it happened to be useful as one of the kids burned themself and I had a hydrogel dressing on me). \n\nAnyway, one of my cousins asked if I have a spare pad, I said: \"Of course, here's my bag, it should be in  the middle pocket.\" Well, apparently she decided to rummage through my things instead of simply taking the pad. She saw my pocket knife and tools and freaked out. She basically started making a scene, accusing me that I probably want to attack someone or have other nefarious plans. It was enough for some older family members to be distraught (they sat long way from us and uderstood only that someone is about to attack us) and chaos ensued. Eventually it got under control, but the atmosphere was ruined. \n\nMy cousin and some family members say that I'm an asshole for bringing dangerous tools for a family gathering. They mostly have problem with my knife and pepper sprawy but say that all in all my EDC is \"weird and freakish and I shouldn't feel endangered in my own family\". I DON'T feel in danger, I just like being prepared. My parents (who obviously know about my habit) aren't mad but say that maybe I shouldn't carry my things among people as it may upset them or make them feel afraid.\n\nDunno if it's important but my bag wasn't military style - it was a normal woman's bag, one you can easily spot on the street. \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1686333346, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/145c1qu/aita_for_bringing_my_edc_everyday_carry_for/", "score": 104, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

They aren't \"dangerous tools\"-they're simply items that you keep for emergencies, and you are wise to do so. I'm not a prepper in any way, but I keep the same type of items in my truck at all times because I am a woman who drives in a lot of rural areas, and you never know what you'll need if you are injured or stranded or attacked.", "NTA.\n\nBeing prepared is being responsible. I have to admit I chuckled a little when I read the contents of your bag because the term \"EDC\" here in the U.S. almost exclusively refers to a pistol.", "> She saw my pocket knife and tools and freaked out\n\nwhat is going on in this girls house that a pocket knife sends her into hysterics?\n\nwere there no other knives at this BBQ?  \n\nNTA, weird reaction.", "NTA. Your edc bag is fine but it's a lesson on not letting __anyone__ snoop in your bag.", "NTA for bringing it but next time *you* go in the bag and get what's needed out of it and bring it to the person who needs it. If it was a handgun not a knife yeah that might be a different story, since that's a tool whose only use is killing, but a knife is literally a tool you can use it to help you make a shelter or make a digging tool for a latrine or fuck just cut the zip ties off of something you just bought in a store. I carry a pocket knife in my pocket everywhere I go every single day, that's not even prepper shit that's just a handy tool to have on you.", "NTA - I bet more than a few of the men also had pocket knives on them.", "Mostly Nta cousin definitely seems difficult. Pepper spray just left in a bag around a bunch of hyper kids might have gone poorly", "I mean how big is this bag?  The size of a sleeping bag?  I keep a Go-Bag in my car, it has many of the same items in it, but it lives in my car. \n\nWhy you felt the need to bring it inside to a family event is kind of strange but the real AH is the kid that went through your bag. \n\nNTA", "NTA.

I was really expecting you to be bringing a gun to a family party. \n\nNTA. it\u2019s just a knife.", "wow, pretty much have all that in my handbag minus the tshirt and dried meat.    NTA not sure why a pocket knife is an issue. Lots of people I know carry multi tools that have knifes in them too.  I'd not let anyone look through you bag in the future best they dont know.", "NTA. Always be prepared, especially if you live in the northwest. Your cousin should have just taken the pad, she was a total AH for rummaging through your things. I\u2019m going to guess it\u2019s mostly normal to have a pocket knife, and she was just being a a little brat when she made a scene. Nothing bad would have happened if she didn\u2019t make a scene. If she had just asked you why you had a knife and pepper spray, or better yet, not rummaged through your stuff, everything would have been fine.", "NTA - Unless one of your tools was a gun you can carry whatever you like in your bag.  Your cousin is a problem creating an issue out of nothing.  I don't get why an adult in the area didn't just say shut up and leave it alone.", "NTA\n\nIt\u2019s often time-consuming and inconvenient to unpack and re-pack for different occasions. There\u2019s nothing wrong with bringing along a bag of your stuff that you usually bring with you. Your family is strange.", "K, that\u2019s not the normal meaning of everyday carry lol\n\nEdit: NTA regardless.", "NTA.\n\nIf pocket knife is so dangerous, surely there must be no knives around, right? Meat for that barbecue must have been prepared using spoons only ( no forks - too stabby).", "NTA\n\nBut its your mistake to let someone open your bag.\n\nYes, the niece has nothing to search, but why you have not giving her the item yourself? \n\nYou know what is in your bag!", "NTA, cousin is though, you told her where the pads were and yet she still went through the rest of the bag.

A pocket knife and pepper spray are not dangerous tools.", "NTA\n\nas a woman, think it is foolish not to carry a utility knife and some sort of defense tool", "NTA, If being prepared is your thing than you do you boo. You can\u2019t help it if she freaked out and caused a scene. That\u2019s not on you :)", "NTA I keep one with that stuff and little more. Honestly it\u2019s not about being a conspiracy theorists. It\u2019s realizing that you can have car trouble. You can get stuck in the middle of a storm. I am a female. I always have a means to protect myself when traveling alone.", "NTA - it's your prerogative what you carry and what you don't carry. she shouldn't have rummaged through your things or made a scene about it.", "Nta, good for you to be prepared. I also have things like that in my car. I do not need to pack anything to go on a 5 day trip because of what I already have in there.

Get over yourselves, family.", "NTA\n\nMy parents gave me a Buck knife when I started driving and a tire iron that had a handle molded to my hand for an easier grip that stayed by me while driving.

After having kids I prefer to be over prepared than not have something. I have an outfit change for everyone in my family in my car and they are adults lol", "Nope, NTA. You did a woman a solid by offering her a pad, then she went through your stuff. Now, if you had a knife holster with a big hunting knife on your belt, that might make you t a, but not having a knife in your bag.", "NTA. There's nothing particularly weird or outlandish as part of your kit, and she should not have been looking through your entire bag.\n\nI have a pocket knife in my purse at all times. It's more of a multi-tool including a knife, small pliers, a corkscrew, etc. It's a remarkably useful item.

I am the walking pharmacy at every family event. Then I have an EDC in the car. Started as a diaper bag. I repack it every year. My SO wouldn't carry our son's diaper bag so I bought a small duffle at a sporting goods store with many pockets. Now its got every thing including spare clothes for my grandsons cause a day at the park...sometimes spare clothes are needed. A lot of our parks have sprinklers and sand. Medical supplies, bug spray, bug bite and sting soother, a bigger first aid kit. instant heat and cold packs. Even has a striker kit. My son bought me a some kind of special lighter that always lights for mother's day. I joked about an EM pulse, it would take that lighter out.

I don't think op is an ah for carrying those items, however she should have just gotten the pad herself. I don't know about the pepper spray, but I have certainly set off aerosols in my hiking pack on accident which makes it an ESH for me.", "Lol I had the exact same reaction. I was all ready to be like \"Yeah, actually, I can see why your family would be upset that you brought a gun to a completely peaceful event with children in attendance, that would upset me, too.\" Then it turns out it was a completely normal bag with some useful tools and first-aid items in it. A pocket knife has a zillion uses other than as a weapon. The pepper spray I guess qualifies as a weapon but it's a pretty common self-defense item for people, especially women, to carry. And the only reason the cousin even knew about it is because OP was *trying to help her out* and she decided to go rummaging through OP's bag despite being told exactly where to find the item she needed.

Betcha there's a butcher block with a bunch of knives in the kitchen too. Does she lie awake at night wondering if her parents are going to steak knife her to death?
