A pocket knife has a zillion uses other than as a weapon. The pepper spray I guess qualifies as a weapon but it's a pretty common self-defense item for people, especially women, to carry.

EDC people are so weird", "nta \n\nThe only weird thing about the story is her going through your belongings, and then acting like somebody having a pocket knife in their possession makes them some type of crazy lunatic that just goes around stabbing people", "NTA\n\nSo let me get this right.\n\nYou was prepared with a burn dressing, and some spare pads.  Is that not the whole idea of EDC.\n\nThe rest of what you describe in bag seems reasonable.", "NTA but have you heard of \"no good deed goes unpunished\"? If you have an EDC then you should be keeping it hidden in plane sight, and shouldn't have offered it around to people imo", "A pocketknife lol. Your cousin is a little sissy pants. And no wonder since the adults all coddled her afterwards because her eyes gazed upon a sharp piece of metal.. NTA.", "I thought this was completely normal. I carry these items every day. I thought you meant a gun! NTA", "NTA. She freaked out for no good reason about stuff she would have had not known about had she not been being a snoop", "Nta. Your cousin is the asshole for invading your privacy without permission!", "NTA\n\nFirst off pepper spray can be dangerous in the right circumstances but this clearly isn't it, secondly how many people carry around pocket knifes or multi-tools all day it shouldn't be all that surprising, and lastly you proved how useful it was immediately before they even knew you had it by giving the poor kid first aid, how is something that can literally help people at any point be weird or ridiculous.", "NTA\n\nThis was my thoughts excatly. I'm from Texas and my coworkers wore visible pocket knives on them at work. You can open carry just about anything here at this point. While I'm not completly on board with that, on the other end I can't really fathom someone freaking out beacuse you had a knife in your bag.", "My mom's family had a reunion a couple of years ago and at least 3 people were open carrying their everyday carry weapon and a couple more had theirs but were drinking so they left them in their cars. My uncle (mom's brother) owns an armory and sells custom firearms, so to say we're comfortable around guns is an understatement.", "Yep, I carried pocket knife and hammer for most of my teens. Because it\u2019s was useful for my studies and with all the other occasions", "> The pepper spray I guess qualifies as a weapon but it's a pretty common self-defense item for people, especially women, to carry. \n\nThe same is true of a handgun \u00af\\\\\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af", "I'm in the PNW as well. Why do you not have the in case of stranded stuff? All I don't have in my car for that is a change of clothes and non-perishable foods", "I thought a bug out bag was for dropping everything and going somewhere else to start new?", "That's actually my instant connection.  When so says pocket knives, it's automatically a Swiss knife in my head.", "But it wasn\u00b4t handed off to the cousin, she was instructed to go in the middle pocket to get the pad. Cousin chose to be nosey and rummage through the rest of the bag where the pepper spray was. \n\nAnd yes, what is the point of pepper spray or a utility knife if you don\u00b4t have it with you? The point of the whole bag is that she is prepared for an emergency when she is away from home", "If you're old enough to need a pad, you're old enough to know better than to go through other people's stuff, *especially* someone who just helped you out with an extra pad.  By this logic, your diary should remain in your possession otherwise it's fair game.", "This is what I thought. My FIL has his CCW on him at all times, even in my private residence which he knows makes me uncomfortable. He is an AH and I was fully ready to call OP an AH if that\u2019s what she meant. This is more just\u2026kind of weird\u2026but doesn\u2019t push her into AH territory imo.", ">Everyday carry (EDC) or every-day carry is a collection of useful items that are consistently carried on person every day.\n\nThat's literally the first line...", "No, but if someone asks what your EDC is, you'd tell them keys, wallet, weapon, and whatever tools you carry every day.", "Nta, knifes are useful no matter where you go, including a bbq, could go as far as use it to cut a steak. Your cousin needs to mind her own business and pull the stick outta her ass", "NTA, but if you can't leave the scene, get someone to bring you the entire bag instead of going through it themselves - she was probably rummaging trying to find the thing since while you know exactly where things are, nobody else does.", "NTA \n\ni always carry a first aid kit and a swiss army knife and nobody has ever complained about it", "NTA. Just weird though. But that is based on where I'm from. Leave it in the car next time.", "NTA- I thought you were talking abt a gun and was going to say yta but it's a pocket knife. \n\nI mean, I may get some therapy to make sure this prepping thing doesn't escalate further or maybe find the source for the anxiety around it but otherwise I think it's fine.", "NTA for bringing it. I would only note that if your cousin is a teen or preteen, it would have been prudent to get it out of your bag yourself rather than letting her access your stuff. If she's an adult, though, she should have chilled out. Of course you are not anticipating being attacked any minute at a family gathering, but if you ran into a problem in transit or if all hell broke loose while you were there, you'd want to have it.", "lol i didnt read the post but this is about a pocket knife? im in switzerland and it would be more shocking to see someone with no knife on them in daily life. i have a tiny one which saves me trouble at least once a week, its just handy.", "You have to understand... The pocket knife is the most dangerous tool present in that barbeque...\n\nNot the skewers or the hot coal/wood. But a pocket knife...\n\n\\s", "My emergency kit is a small kit that sits inside a small daybag. I've got the kit and a little bit of storage space for anything that I need.  It's unobtrusive and really useful.", ">A pocket knife has a zillion uses other than as a weapon.\n\nAnd unless the food bought for the barbecue was precut into bite size pieces, I'm pretty sure the knives there would have been way more useful as a weapon.", "EDCs are just items you carry every day. A purse can be an EDC, but it doesn't have to be. The contents of the purse can be EDCs rather than the purse itself. I have EDCs that can fit into a lot of bags and purses. I also don't call them EDCs, just 'shit I need on me'.", "My husband and I call them \u201cgo bags.\u201d It isn\u2019t a purse. I don\u2019t carry it with me everywhere. It hangs out in my car.", "Right? At my family gathers my spouse is the odd one out for NOT carrying a knife everywhere. My Dad had to go through the metal detector to go in the St. Louis Arch and it was like the \"coat-check your weapons\" scene in a bad movie with all the little blades and tools he pulled out of his pockets.", "Go go power rangers!", "Personally I carry a straight razor, \\*in a specific place in my backpack which also has a lil bit of everything barring the kitchen sink. Fixed knives over 3 inches are illegal where I live  and IIRC pop-out-blade (can't remember the proper term) knives are illegal to carry on public no matter what the dimensions.\n\n\nBut I'm damned if I'm not having that weapon of last resort even if the law here does prefer me defenceless. In my opinion the entire underpinning philosophy of packing one's everyday handbag/satchel/backpack is \"I'd rather have it and never use it, than need it and come up short\".\n\n\n(edit for typo)", "Obviously knife beats spoon in such games. But should you add a spoon to your knife in some way, would that enhance the stats of the knife itself? Essentially, can a spoon serve as a tiebreaker?", "Mini sewing and med kits, too, and a diddy tube of superglue. Also hairbands, beauty and hygiene stuffs, emergency pair of clean knickers, paper and pen, charger bank + leads, and something that's sensorially pleasant to fiddle with.", "Agreed, but I have definitely seen \"EDC\" used to describe the gun a person carries on their person in daily life, as opposed to guns they have for specific tasks. Then again I'm not American, so I  really don't get the civilian gun thing.", "Lord, my hubby is so happy he married me.  My dad is so proud of his daughter.  I'm the pocket knife carrying, emergency kit in the trunk, able to crawl under the car, and under the sink gal.  And I fix people too.  Now, if I could just open the dang wood glue bottle by myself, I'd be all set!  Lol", "This is, however, not a hard and fast rule. In my experience there's usually at least one guy who leans hard into the degendering-pink thing, and so the be-pinked tools are still at risk from that sort of person.", "No one can open the wood glue. That takes some next level sorcery, or a pair of pliers.", ">SOWRD\n\n\nTypo or deliberately portraying a particular voice/accent? Trying to pronounce it mentally is giving me a stroke \ud83d\ude02", "I know people who don't believe in seat-belts, it doesn't make buckling up any less safe.", "But it means the bag was unattended and unsecured for the cousin to rummage through. I would feel totally different about this if OP left the bag in her car, but she physically carries it and leaves it unattended is the problem. I\u2019m an advocate for arming yourself and being smart about it."]}
