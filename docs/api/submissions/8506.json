We have spent a lot of time together. \n\nWe have been invited on *countless* skiing trips with friends over the years (we live near the snow), and every single time I have told people that I couldn\u2019t think of anything worse. I literally cannot stand skiing. I did one lesson as a kid and never returned. This is all knowledge to M44. In fact, I think you\u2019d be hard pressed to find anyone who knows me who wouldn\u2019t say that I have actual disdain for the sport. No offence to ski people - you do you. It\u2019s just not my jam.\n\nFast forward to a day or two before Christmas and i suddenly find myself being handed a last minute gift (M44 bought it whilst we were playing pool at a skiing place) which was a voucher for 10 skiing lessons. Like wtf?\n\nAnyway, today I worked a 12 hour day. In the sun, on the tools, 12 hours.

It\u2019s almost like giving someone skiing lessons who spent the last five years saying how much they hate it\u2019. So look, I said it and I was genuinely laughing - but they got so offended they hung up on me. I\u2019m ADHD and ASD so my delivery can be misinterpreted at times, but I was genuinely just having a laugh. It\u2019s not like I had a meltdown and started crying \u201cyou don\u2019t know me at all!\u201d or anything like that\u2026.\n\nETA: this isn\u2019t the first time I\u2019ve been given a weird gift, and it\u2019s always vouchers. Last year it was to get my boat license\u2026 but I live hundreds of kilometres from the ocean, and uh\u2026 I don\u2019t own a boat? \ud83e\udd14 I politely declined that gift and returned it to him for a refund, simply stating that it was out of reach for me to buy a boat, and not something I desired to do. \n\nSo tell me, please, AITA?", "created_utc": 1674894265, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10na455/aita_for_pointing_out_to_someone_who_has_known_me/", "score": 124, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It seems like you have a hard time navigating these kinds of situations politely with humor and that\u2019s probably not your fault. \n\nFor example it isn\u2019t typical to give someone a hard time over inviting you to dinner at your favorite restaurant\u2026 even if the timing wasn\u2019t convenient. It\u2019s more typical to just show appreciation for the invitation. \n\nYour friend seems to give thoughtless but generous gifts. Given the generosity, it\u2019s typical to just thank someone for a gift that doesn\u2019t hit the mark, and avoid having an honest discussion about why you won\u2019t actually use it.\n\nWith the autistic people in my life, I appreciate them for their honesty. They can often come across rude, and it\u2019s not always easy to just attribute that to neurodiversity, but I do my best to accept and appreciate these kinds of differences.", "NTA. Since OP claimed that they\u2019ve known each other for five years and dated for three, they should\u2019ve been able to tell or recognize each other\u2019s likes and dislikes. It\u2019s disappointing to see that the person you\u2019ve been in a relationship for such a long time failed to pay attention to your interests. This seems more like OP\u2019s partner got her that gift for the sake of it. If you like someone or generally are close to someone, you cannot avoid but to notice their behaviors and moods over most situations. You automatically have an idea of what might interest them. You don\u2019t just go and get smth that you like or you \u201cassume\u201d she might like without paying attention to her actual interests. OP\u2019s partner isn\u2019t ideal, i\u2019m sorry", "NTA, I think the joke was a little inappropriate, I think if you just talked without the joke it woulda been better and less passive aggressive but no tthe asshole", "NTA\n\nIt seems like he was forcing his interests on you, considering that you've been talking about how much you hate skiing. Also, I understand that you wouldn't want to try skiing either. It's like having an allergy and your partner asks you to have some of the food with the allergen in it just because he/she made it and likes it. I do get where he's coming from, though. He's trying to get you into it so he could have someone he loves to share this interest and go for skiing as a couple with his friends or others you or he may know. It's sweet but he's not trying to see why it's more of a \"don't want to and can't\" than just \"can't ski and don't know how to\". And going as far as to give it as a Christmas gift is kind of ... But anyway, it doesn't seem like a red flag or anything. So, OP, if you want this to work, maybe you should talk to him and tell him how both of you are different people with different interests and likes and dislikes. That you will still love him even if he doesn't share interest in something you like and he should do the same. And whenever you have free time you could pick one hobby that you are both interested in and, well, have a good time!", "I will probably get downvoted, but oh well, who cares.\n\nI go with ESH\n\nYour \"joke\" was rude and you came off passive-aggressive, after he invited you at your favourite restaurant. You could have simply said, \"Hey, I'm knackred today. Can we go any other day?\"\n\nBut, about the skiing lessons gift, he was a bit of a-hole, too: he knows you don't like skiing and yet he gifted you lessons??? Weird. Have you asked him why? Maybe he likes skiing, so he wants you to learn too? \n\nAnyway I would never give a bathing suit to a person who can't swim, or a helmet to a person who hates motorcycles, or try to force them to learn something they have no interest in learning.\n\nEDIT AFTER READING OP EDIT\n\nA voucher to take boat license to a person who doesn't live at the seaside and doesn't own a boat? WTH! This is so random. Could it be that he recycles vouchers that have been given to him?", "So in my opinion, ESH.\n\nLet me get yours out of the way first: I\u2019m also ADHD and still I recognize your comment was rude. You should\u2019ve told him normally that you didn\u2019t like the gift, instead of taking a month to bring it up in a passive aggressive fashion. I do appreciate that you were exhausted though, and if he knew about your schedule his invitation was very unreasonable.\n\nOn his side of sucking, he seems to be doing less than bare minimum for you. He\u2019s giving you gifts and inviting you to your favourite restaurant, yes - but the gifts are a complete miss (and it\u2019s common knowledge that they are) and the invitations come at a time when it\u2019s the last thing you need. He spends all that money to feel good about himself with ZERO consideration for what your needs are. It\u2019s hardly something a friend does.", "YTA.  There\u2019s always some truth in the joke which makes it not a joke. You should have a calm conversation with this person about the gift if you felt that way. Just because you hate it doesn\u2019t give you the right to be mean. Not everyone is blessed with your gift giving skills. \n\nAnd the dinner thing in general, Just politely decline. No snarkiness necessary.", "NTA\n\nI find it quite a clever statement in your exasperation.  He didn't like being called on his behaviour.\n\nThere is a part of me that wonders if he has ADHD too and just forgot that important part of you.  He wasn't really listening each time you said it.  He might just be embarrassed you called him on you.\n\nIn some ways I'm surprised he remembered what he got you for Christmas seeing as it was more than a month ago and seems like a rushed gift.  Maybe the lessons were actually for someone else but he thought they'd do because you were there.\n\nSo I wonder whether his attitude is more about you pointing out your life in the context of him asking you to dinner and he didn't even hear the comment about the ski lessons.  I'm also wondering whether he wants to rekindle your relationship and this just sounds like a knock back to that.", "YTA for what you said about their restaurant invitation.\n\nYou could have simply declined if didn't want to go instead of insulting them for asking you.", "YTA\n\nWhat you said comes off as pretty ungrateful and then proceeded to laugh in his face about it.    You don't have to LIKE the gift, but you also don't have to knock the dude who - in reality - didn't have to buy you a singular things, let alone a pack of ski lessons that (I'm assuming) cost a few hundred dollars.", "YTA\n\nYou laughed in his face and mocked him. Not cool. In fact, it was a bit cruel \n\nI was gonna say your hatred for skiing due to one incident is a bit ridiculous but you're ASD so I guess you have a mental barrier there?", "YTA. Good job making sure this person never buys you another gift or invites you out again. Learn to say, \u201cno thank you. That doesn\u2019t work for me.\u201d Without the mockery.

Did he know you had worked a 12-hour shift? Either way, all you had to say was 'Thanks for the thought but I'm exhausted after work and I have another long day tomorrow. Another time?' \nFor the ski lessons - does he like skiing? Maybe he wanted you to give it a proper try to see if you would change your mind (one childhood lesson doesn't really count imo). Whatever his reasoning it was a bit passive aggressive to bring it up now, so long after the fact.", "NTA \n\nPeople are calling it entitlement but I think it\u2019s completely reasonable to be a bit frustrated with a gift you hate. Especially if the giver knows you more intimately. I think the lack of communication negatively manifested when you bluntly pointed out his flawed decision making skills (inviting you to your fav restaurant on a day you work long hours) nonetheless it came off passive aggressive and slightly rude. I think a lot of this could have been avoided if you would have communicated your frustration earlier. YTA for the mean joke but NTA for hating his gift. I have relatively high expectations of people I love so I understand. Seems like a thoughtless purchase which defeats the purpose of a gift in my humble opinion.", "YTA for that comment. It doesn't matter how you meant it. You clearly let them know you didn't like the gift and delivered it terribly. \n\nBut honestly, ESH. He should have known better.", "Esh. That joke was really passive aggressive. But your friend is super weird", "YTA - You were very passive aggressive. Using a \u201claughing\u201d tone does not hide the intent of the words. Why would anything that you said not be taken as anything but criticism from your friend? Your friend invited you to dinner and you used that opportunity to not only criticize the dinner invite itself, but the Christmas present that he gave you. It\u2019s rude and the other N T A votes on this are wrong. If you get a gift that you don\u2019t like, thank the giver and don\u2019t use it. If it was too much of an inconvenience for you to go to dinner on short notice, thank the person for thinking of you, then politely decline the invite.", "YTA, you sound entitled and passive aggressive. It's okay not to like a gift, but common courtesy dictates you say thanks. Later you can regift / return / throw it out.\n\nAbout the dinner invitation: you can just say you can't go and that's all. No need to force yourself, do a shit ton of preparation only to ruing the whole thing by acting passive aggressive.\n\nNo is a complete sentence, try using it, it will make your life easier.", "Also, OP wasn\u2019t rude or ungrateful. It is fair for her to feel the way she did. Again, NTA. OP\u2019s partner needs to pay more attention to her just like she does to him", "True. The joking wasn\u2019t all that funny. I do regret that.", "Thanks for your thoughtful reply. \n\nHe doesn\u2019t ski, I have never known him to go skiing\u2026 which makes it even more strange. \n\nI do regret speaking in the moment. I am tired. Hungry. Not at my peak kindness moment for sure.", "He does want to rekindle, but I find it hard to connect as I feel like he knows nothing about me. I do try to fit into the \u2018box\u2019 of what he wants most of the time, and he *can* be caring at times, but I often wonder the sentiment behind the gifts. Like if I don\u2019t follow along with his plans, well, I\u2019ve also felt the wrath of his anger - very spiteful, nasty things. \n\nI just wish I knew who he actually was. I can never quite know if he is a kind person who sometimes is nasty, or a nasty person who is trying to come off as kind.", "True. When I initially declined, he said \u2018fine, I\u2019ll go by myself and send you photos of the food\u2019, which is what got me frustrated and lead into my comments. \n\nBut I should not have stooped to the level I did. I\u2019ve since eaten, and feel much calmer about the situation.", "See, usually, I would agree, but they have been in each others lives for long enough, and op has stated many times that she hates skiing. Yes, she sounds ungrateful, but she has every right to be. If it cost him a couple of hundred, then that's on him. There was no thought at all because if there had been, he wouldn't have bought it for her.", "I understand given the cost of things it can seem a lot, but this is his equivalent of buying a candle. He is very wealthy and impulsive, it can be difficult at times. \n\nI definitely should have delivered my opinion in a kinder way, I do agree. Thanks for your reply.", "What incident?", "I agree, I didn\u2019t handle it the best. And I\u2019m totally okay with no gifts! It\u2019s my preference.

I prefer to buy things as they present themselves throughout the year. \n\nThanks for your opinion.", "He knew I was working. He called a few times during the shift. Which is fine \u2014 I am happy to chat. He knew I was exhausted. He knew I had work tomorrow. \n\nBit of background, he does impose all his joys onto me. It\u2019s quite difficult. I\u2019m pretty simple, I love cooking so a cooking class would be amazing. I like performing arts, any theatre show would be amazing. Or\u2026 just nothing! Nothing as a gift. I don\u2019t want presents anyway. \n\nI always reciprocate with something he likes. I take him for dinners to his favourite restaurants. Buy him the books he really wants to read. I put a lot of thought into the gifts I get him\u2026 I find it weird that zero thought goes into what I receive. Like I said I\u2019m pretty simple and I am open about my likes and dislikes. \n\nMy delivery was probably not the best, but I don\u2019t regret pointing it out because this has been going on for years. It\u2019s a reason we broke up \u2014 he has no interest in who I am.", "I respect your opinion. Thank you.", "Oh then it's probably the skiing invitations you both received. Maybe he wanted to ski with friends and wants you to come along to. Just explain how you can't tolerate skiing and that he could very well go with friends and have fun and you'd be happy to watch", "You're NTA here but stop trying to cram yourself into the \"boxes.\" If he's used to you contorting to meet his desires and satisfy him on other things, then of course he expects to you to keep doing it by making yourself available for dinner and skiing.", "\"There was no thought at all!\"\n\nYou understand that this dude wasn't obligated to get OP a gift in the first place, right?

He bought it because he was there and figured he best get her something. I would much rather not receive a gift than receive one the giver knows I will hate. No thought was put into the actual gift, just that he had to get her one. And who told him he had to spend hundreds of dollars on it? He could have bought her something she would enjoy for a fraction of the price, but he didn't. He bought her a gift, knowing she would hate it because he happened to be there playing pool. To me, that is 0 thought.", "What makes that an incident? Nothing bad happened \u2014 I just had no interest in it. I was quite good at it.

That doesn't make it any better when they know your feelings I just don't understand. Have you asked them why?", "Ok well if it's an ongoing issue in your friendship then that changes things a bit.", "To give him any benefit of the doubt, maybe he thought that because you haven't really done anything more than one lesson as a child, you might be afraid on the mountain, and he thought lessons would help ease that fear? It sounds like your friend group skiis relatively often, and maybe he also thinks one lesson as a child isn't giving it a fair shot?\n\nGranted, that doesn't really mean he should have wasted money on lessons when it was never asked for. It'd be one thing if you guys talked about this and you said \"yeah maybe with more lessons I'd give it a go\" but it doesn't sound like that's EVER been the case. \n\nAs an aside, have you ever tried snowboarding? I've heard that people are usually like one and hate the other.
