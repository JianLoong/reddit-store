My family lives abroad and are coming over to stay and help at Christmas time. For now, my MIL and FIL (60s-Debra and Bob) are helping me with household stuff and the baby. So far, we haven\u2019t had any real issues and they\u2019ve been a massive help.\n\nAbout 3 weeks ago, I fell down the stairs. I wasn\u2019t holding the baby and the baby was safe. However, instead of helping me, Debra and Bob both jumped to comfort the baby who was crying\u2026 and left me at the bottom of the stairs. My legs were fine, but I was wobbly because of shock and asked one of them to help me up. After nearly 10 whole minutes of being ignored, I managed to stand up on my own and hobble through to the living room. I sit down and Debra says \u2018what\u2019s happened to you? Are you ok?\u2019.\n\nI\u2019ll admit, I saw red. I just said 'I fell down the stairs, didn't you hear me calling you for help?' Debra's eyes widened and she said she was too busy fussing over the baby.\n\nAfter an hour, my arm was swelling up and I was taken to hospital. Luckily, it was nothing serious and recovery time would be quick. After my boyfriend got home and his parents left, I told him I no longer want their help after today's events. I can manage on my own, even though it'll be hard. He was taken aback and said they've done a lot for us. I said I appreciated it all but they ignored me crying and calling them for 10 minutes after I fell down the stairs. They don't care about me, only the baby and I was embarassed I didn't see it sooner.\n\nHe called his parents to let them know we won't need their help anymore and his dad said 'is it about today? we really didn't hear her.' My boyfriend just told them they're invited to sunday roast this week and that's all. I could tell he was not happy about my decision but he said he went along with it because I'm the mother.\n\nFast forward to Sunday and my BIL and SIL are guests as well. SIL has a 3 year old and is totally on my side but BIL is not. He told me to 'be grateful' for his parent's support as they're significantly more well-off than my parents are and paid for many newborn/infant expenses and plan to pay for many more as the baby grows.\n\nSince then, Debra keeps calling asking if we need any help and says she feels awful not seeing 'the both of you' and that she misses the baby.\n\nAITA for not wanting them helping me in my day to day life?\n\nEDIT: Was the baby crying loudly enough that there is a possibility they didn\u2019t hear you?  \nNo way. The baby stopped crying after 10 seconds and the stairs are like 2 meters from the living room. There is absolutely zero way they couldn't have heard me  \n1- scream as I fell  \n2- the general noise of someone falling, including books falling and wall plates breaking  \n3- me crying and shouting for help  \nI fell at the top of the stairs and fell all the way down. This wasn't a missed step and a bum shuffle down that hurt my pelvic bone. I fully fell down the stairs and cracked the banister. No way they didn't' hear. The baby also started crying AFTER the initial smack after I hit the ground.", "created_utc": 1697139082, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/176fanj/aita_for_not_letting_my_mil_and_fil_help_me_with/", "score": 8382, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

From what you described, there's no way they didn't hear you fall. They deliberately chose to ignore you lying there, possibly seriously hurt. And they are lying about it. They didn't help you at all until YOU managed to get yourself to a place that they could no longer ignore you.  In turn, You cannot ignore behavior like that. You just can't. What if you'd punctured a lung or passed out from a serious concussion? What if you'd died because they couldn't be bothered to investigate? You are better off without that kind of \"help.\" \n\nI'm aghast that your husband didn't rip them each a new one.", "I would be fucking angry that my husband was only supporting me because I was the mom. \n\nWhat if you'd broken your fucking neck ? What if you'd been dead at the bottom of the stairs while they cooed over your baby ? Ask him THAT. ask him if he'd be ANGRIER IF YOU WERE GONE BECAUSE OF IT. he does not have the appropriate level of anger. \n\nYou are one hundred percent in the right here and your BIL can shove that \"you should be grateful\" comment up his freaking butt. He'd shut up real fast if it happened to him. \n\nNTA", "NTA. \n\nYou are the only one who knows the layout of your home, the timeframe of the crying and the noise, and how everyone reacted. \n\nI can't imagine that upon hearing thumps and screams, they would rush to a baby- who is fine- and for the next 10 minutes they didn't bother to call out for you or to investigate where the noise came from. While they may not have intentionally ignored you, they displayed a lack of care for you, and weirdly for themselves. If I hear a big noise, I'm looking around, and I'm certainly yelling out for anyone else who would be home, both to make sure they are okay but also to make sure we aren't being robbed or something is wrong. My dad drops a pot on the floor once a day and we still all yell \"YOU OKAY\" even though we know exactly what the man did. \n\nAnd you know what, it doesn't matter if they want to help, or if they have given you a ton of money and stuff. You aren't going no contact with them and you aren't keeping them from the baby, you just don't want them around every day. Your feelings are hurt and you don't want to rely on them in the same way. I might agree with your BIL if you were fully not speaking to them, but you are just scaling back their involvement, and that's fine.", "NTA.  If they couldn\u2019t respond to an emergency situation within meters of where they were then how  are they responsible enough to take any care of a baby.", "NTA- after reading your edit, it seems like there is NO way they didn\u2019t hear you. Have they done stuff like this in the past?", "NTA\n\n\"that she misses the baby.\"\n\nThat's all she misses.   Not the baby's \"incubator.\"  Sorry you  found out this way.", "Babies cries are high-pitched. \n\nA tumble down the stairs is a lot of ruckus. An adult human cries at a much lower register than a baby. \n\nI'm pointing this out because if they are trying to say that \"my hearing isn't what it used to be...\", then that is not a good argument. The first thing to go is hearing at the higher registers, meaning if anything, it would have been the baby's cries that they couldn't hear. \n\nBut if we ignore that, then let's see what the situation is: \n\nThey heard the baby crying. Presumably YOU heard the baby cry. \n\nIf I'm at someone's house, and their baby cries, I wonder, \"Why isn't mom/dad taking care of this baby?\" After I've checked to make sure the baby is okay, I go to check out why the parent didn't come. Where are you? Are you ignoring your baby? Do you need help? Were you in the bathroom? Did you *fall down the stairs?*\n\nNo matter what way you look at it, there's something fishy about this situation. \n\nNTA", "Nta. You don't comfort a baby and not look for why they are crying. The noise probably scared the baby. Where did the noise come from? They should have checked on you even if they didn't hear you.\n\nIf someone shouts in this house, people come to check. Even if it's just barely heard. Especially after sounds of things falling and breaking. Something could have affected how loud they could yell, and they needed help.", "NTA  \n\n\nAnd if you really want to take it step further, especially about being alone with baby, you can say they can't trust them to be with baby. Because if they didnt hear your obvious yelling then there must be something wrong with their hearing and what if they cant hear the baby? See they can't argue with that without sounding like they purposely ignored you.", "NTA. Is your boyfriend a lot older than you? I only ask because what BIL said to you.", "They can hear a baby cry but they can't hear you screaming for help or falling down stairs. It definitely sound intentional. Not so much they wanted you out of the picture but you just aren't a high enough priority for them to be concerned about. Extra help is nice now and then but there's no way I could handle someone coming in constantly. I want to patent my kids, not stand by while someone else does it. If you can afford to hire a housekeeper a couple days a week, do that if you can't keep up with both.", "NTA. \n\nI think they can visit when your husband is around. You don't need their \"help\".", "What strange behavior on their part! INFO Have there been signs that they hate you, or are deranged?", "NTA. In addition to what everyone else has noted, I want to point out that it sounds like your bf\u2019s parents come to help out when he isn\u2019t around (I\u2019m guessing he\u2019s at work?). So he 100% shouldn\u2019t have a say in whether or not they help since it\u2019s not even impacting him. \n\nYou should make sure he understands that he should be supportive of your choice because you\u2019re the only person who is directly impacted. Not just because you\u2019re the mom. If he wants them around when he\u2019s at home and you\u2019re not, that\u2019s his right, too. If you let him rely on the reasoning that your opinion matters most just because you\u2019re the mother, that will build resentment, because he\u2019s the father so if something impacts you both equally then your decisions should be made together as opposed to unilaterally.", "NTA \n\nIf you can\u2019t trust someone to help you when you need them why have them there? \n\nYou don\u2019t trust them anymore and that\u2019s fair", "NTA, but his parents and brother are! Their excuses for not hearing you is BS, AND your FIL knowing why, proves they did it on purpose\u2026 they knew what they were doing and are now acting like \u201cwhat did we do?\u201d How about- nothing\u2026 your NTA", "If they can\u2019t be trusted to check on an adult after screaming, knocking down plates, and falling down the stairs, then they certainly can\u2019t be trusted to watch a small child.\n\nNTA. Even if they genuinely somehow didn\u2019t hear you, it only proves they\u2019re not fit to look after a baby.", "NTA; In-Law's actions and reactions are telling after OP was injured.  Would they have just stepped over her if she was bleeding to death on the ground or had a broken leg?  I can understand OP no longer trusting them for help.", "This is one of the more bizarre stories on here. I think you\u2019re doing the right thing. Your in-laws have something seriously wrong with them.", "NTA.  From how you described it, they heard you repeatedly crying out in pain and just didn\u2019t care, which is pretty horrifying.  I\u2019d need to not see their faces for a *long* time after that.  \n\nBut even if we\u2019re being super generous and giving them the benefit of the doubt (or perhaps super in denial, like your SO?), you\u2019re still allowed (encouraged even!) to have healthy boundaries with your in-laws, like \u201cyou guys can\u2019t be over here 24/7, I need space.\u201d  \n\nAnd no, your BIL insisting the in-laws should be allowed to buy themselves a free pass to cross boundaries would be a non-starter for me, too.", "NTA...i find their excuse that they didn't hear a person scream as they fell down stair ridiculous", "NTA - Either they ignored your cry for help or they couldn't hear it. If they can't hear a cry for help, they aren't fit to be left alone with an infant or a toddler. If they ignored your cries, they aren't fit to be left alone with you and/or an infant or a toddler. It's nice that they have given you the time they've given you, but they have proven themselves to be insufficient to the task and untrustworthy with those you care about. \n\nPerhaps, over time, they may come into your good graces again, but you aren't required to forgive them or forget they ignored you in your time of need. And you may take the time you need to process that. As long as it takes.", "NTA\n\nBaby starts crying, I think *first* parental/grandparental response would be to tend to the baby.  And it's possible that the time they left you at the foot of the stairs was shorter than ten minutes.   \n\n\nBut, two adults, one baby, baby clearly alarmed but NOT hurt, that meant the NEXT priority is to go check on the person who just fell down the stairs - even if they didn't hear you calling for help, as you say, they damned sure heard you FALLING.   \n\n\nWhat I'd say is:  \n\n\n \"I fell down the stairs, and you heard me fall. I believe you when you say you didn't hear me calling for help, but the fact that neither of you cared enough even to come out of the sitting-room and check if I was okay after I fell down stairs, says to me that I don't want you looking after my kid. Next time it might be HER falling downstairs, and you sitting in the sitting-room not hearing her call for help and unworried by the fact that you just heard someone fall down your stairs.\"  \n\n\nIf they respond with \"Oh of course we'd come check on OUR GRANDCHILD\" you'll know you were right to think they don't care a bit about you, but you can then just reiterate that you have no reason to believe this claim, since they did, in fact, sit in the sitting room unable to hear you calling for help and not bothering to get up to check if you were all right, and you don't want that to happen to *anyone*, but especially not to your daughter.", "NTA. You could have easily died from a fall like that. Or been permanently disabled. They heard you.", "Here is what I think MAY have happened. Two older people who are probably worried they won't hear the child are hyper-focused on said child. Mom falls down the stairs, loudly and startles the baby. The elders hear \"something\" look at the child and -sure enough- He's crying. They go and fuss over him and \"ignore\" you cause they truly didn't hear you. \n\n\r  \nAre there walls between the stairs and the room they were in? Is there a door? I'm not quite as old as your in-laws but I am getting there and I can tell you I have a hard time hearing things outside of the room I'm in. If the T.V. were on or a baby were crying I probably wouldn't hear it at all if you were calling for help after the baby stopped crying. They truly may not have heard you. \n\n  \nTBH I think you may have a little bit of after-pregnancy sadness.  I've been a new mother. I remember what it was like to have everyone fussing over you for 9 long months, and then suddenly everyone is paying attention to...not you... Not that you don't love that everyone loves your son as much as you do, but while you were pregnant you got the attention and fuss and now, you're just the mom.  I'd say heal up and give them another chance. Unless they have shown actual signs of disrespect or dislike towards you, which it doesn't really sound like that is the case then I think you are very possibly TA. Maybe you, SiL, and MiL should have a girls' night, leave the baby with dad and grandpa, and go have a few cocktails and a long talk about motherhood.", "NTA \n\nIf you are certain, and it sounds like you are, that there is no way that they didn\u2019t hear you fall, then this is psychotic. I would help my least favorite person in the world if they fell down a flight of stairs so hard they cracked the bannister. This is bizarre and alarming behavior, and I don\u2019t blame you for not wanting them around", "NTA so they were essentially next to the stairs and say they never heard you scream, thump all the way down, hear books thump down, a plate shatter or you hit hard enough to crack a bannister. And then never heard you crying for help. My neighbor fell down our apartment stairs at 3am. It makes a shit ton of noise.\n\nEven if that was true, they still never thought, \"oh it's weird op has been gone for a while and didn't come when the baby cried.\" I think that everyone calling you a drama queen is delusional. Your boyfriend isn't going to cut off this parents from watching the baby over one issue one time. Your MIL isn't going to apologize for \"not seeing both of you\" if this wasn't already an issue. Your SIL agrees with you.... BIL's only defense is the parents are a checkbook for the baby.\n\nEdit for typo", "NTA. You have JustNo in-laws.", "No you were right. They didn\u2019t even check on you right after.  Absolutely not. Hire a nanny if you can.", "The fact that SIL validates your concerns is all you need. Someone outside of that family unit gets it, and that's telling. Husband and BIL can stay mad about it. They weren't there to help you\n\nNTA", "NTA, after your edit I don\u2019t believe for a second that they didn\u2019t hear you fall. They probably heard the baby crying , prioritised checking on the baby and once found that he was okay simply didn\u2019t care to check on you. Even if they didn\u2019t hear you calling for help, who hears that much banging and plates smashing and doesn\u2019t bother to go investigate? \n\nI wouldn\u2019t want them around either , they\u2019re essentially using you and your house to see their grandson but clearly couldn\u2019t care less about you and don\u2019t care to hide it.", "NTA. This is absolutely horrible of them, and it doesn't sound like you've had a real apology at all. I'm guessing the reason SIL is on your side is because she's had the disposable-incubator experience, too. And really, they made it clear they were not prepared to help in an actual emergency!", "NTA. It sounds like the sounds were so loud and distressing that the baby started crying. If the baby can hear then I\u2019m sure they can. The baby quieted quickly. There was no reason they couldn\u2019t hear at that point.\n\nBut what\u2019s the excuse? That even though they were super close and the sounds were super loud, neither of them can hear well enough to know you had a potentially serious accident? In what world is that supposed to inspire confidence in their ability to help you? Again, I think they are lying but even if they aren\u2019t\u2026.that\u2019s not exactly better from a safety standpoint. \n\nBesides, if someone acts in a way that makes you anxious and distrustful, their help isn\u2019t really helpful. If you don\u2019t want or need their help then that\u2019s your choice.", "NTA. I wouldn't have them jn the home at all unless your husband is there. It was callous of them not to respond to your calls for help. Maybe they were hoping you were dying there or something? It is a very abnormal behaviour on their part.", "You're describing these seemingly loving, helpful and supportive in law grandparents as turning randomly into people so deranged that they'd let you sit there howling in pain, writhing in agony. Huh. \n\nSure enough comments draw the odd conclusion that they left you to die to steal your baby to raise with their son. Huh.\n\nIf you truly never ever ever have any expectations around needing their help again and truly plan not to ask for it knock yourself out and make this a thing. If my top interpretation is correct run away with your kid and never look back because that's just unhinged behavior on their part.\n\nI guess I'd want a more balanced walk through here before judgement because a lot of this interpretation just doesn't make sense to me.", "NTA.\n\nThey couldn't care less about you, and they proved that. You could've been severely injured, laying there dying, and only after your husband got home would you have gotten help.", "NTA. Tell your bil to mind his business. Just because they gave you monetary help doesn't mean they own you or your baby. And his parents aren't better than yours because they have more money.", "NTA\n\nYou're a young mom - not a judgement, just an observation. And I would like to pretend I am your big sister and leave you two pieces of advice that I have found valuable:\n\n1) Trust your instincts \n\n2) When people show you who they are, believe them \n\nYou are in the right here.", "I really hope you see this. I had a fall in the living room about a year ago. I hurt my legs, my shoulder, and my back. I screamed for my husband for at least ten minutes. He didn't come, and it took probably twenty more minutes for me to crawl to furniture to help me stand.\n\nI hobbled to the bedroom and told him what happened. This man, who sometimes texted my words verbatim from the bedroom to tell me to lower my speaking voice in the living room, said he didn't hear me. Then he said I didn't seem that banged up and could wait to see my doctor and didn't need to go to the hospital.\n\nIf I could leave my husband of 17 years over ignoring my shouting and then treating my injuries as no big deal, you can tell your in-laws to pound sand.", "If I was the MIL and genuinely hadn't heard you fall and cry out, I'd have been absolutely mortified and extremely apologetic. Their reaction seemed so nonchalant and uncaring, they don't deserve to be around you.", "INFO: is this part of an ongoing pattern? Because if it\u2019s a first offense, you need to consider the possibility that they were genuinely unaware of the incident, even though you can\u2019t imagine how that could be possible. It\u2019s the second offense where you go scorched earth. \n\nDo not relinquish an otherwise valuable support system unless you are absolutely sure it is necessary.", "Nta and I would push them to answer truthfully. But also consider that maybe they are going deaf. If they are not going deaf then I think you just need to flat out say- I know you heard me so I\u2019m order to move on I want to know why you chose not to help me after I fell.", "If you genuinely don't need their help and won't need anything going forward, NTA. Even if they didn't hear you, 10 minutes is enough time to wonder where you were. Being grateful for help previously provided doesn't automatically mean you have to continue accepting it, and being on your own for several minutes after an injury can feel longer and takes it's own mental toll.  \n\nThat said, if you actually *do* need help, punishing them will likely backfire.", "You\u2019re not the asshole, but why do you need help with the seven month old baby every day?", "NTA. I can't imagine how surreal it must have felt to be so close to two different people who could have heard and helped you immediately, and been ignored for ten minutes. Tell your husband to go sit on the couch, then throw something heavy down the stairs and start calling him. If he can hear you, he knows damn well they can hear you.", "Theres no way they didn\u2019t hear that. They just didn\u2019t care. Nta", "NTA stick to your boundaries. They showed their true colors.", "NTA\n\nMaybe...MAYBE...one of them couldn't hear, but there's no way they both missed that much commotion. How could they possibly do that to you and expect you to be fine with them?\n\nYour BIL is also an asshole for his classist response of bringing money into it. Decent human behavior is more important than money. What if you had broken something? Would their money have saved you?", "After reading your edit, I am absolutely floored. You could\u2019ve been dead at the bottom of the stairs and they wouldn\u2019t have cared. NTA and they honestly wouldn\u2019t be allowed in my house ever again until they acknowledge what they didn\u2019t do.", "NTA Your BIL is suggesting that you have a relationship with people for their money. Yuck. I can\u2019t imagine what was going through those people\u2019s heads while you were stranded.", "Financial support doesn't mean much if you're dead.  A fall down the stairs, especially with shattered plates, could have been very serious.  What if you'd broken something,  severed an artery,  had internal bleeding,  broken your neck or back,  etc.  They left you there for ten minutes.  If you had any of those injuries,  ten minutes could mean the difference between getting medical help in time, or bleeding out. They would have left you screaming in a puddle of your own blood with zero fucks given. \n\nConsider this a warning.  You are not safe with them.  They do not give a shit about you,  and your worth to them is solely through your husband's attachment and the production of grandchildren.  \n\nWhich means your husband needs to be the one to draw the line,  to enforce just how far past the line of any kind of human decency they've gone.  If he doesn't think that is his part as your partner,  husband,  and father of your child,  then you need to start drawing lines, fast and firmly.  If he cannot support you when his own family left you injured and in danger,  then how do you expect him to support you in anything else important? How can you trust him with your safety,  with your life, \nwith your child?  This is the one of the most fundamental,  basic instincts - to protect your family.  If he refuses,  then to him,  you are not family.", "Your SIL is on your side because she's been in your exact position. NTA", "NTA and good for you for sticking to your guns.  If they don't respect mom, they don't get to see the baby.", "Nta", "NTA. What a bizarre situation and a remarkable lack of concern for you. Definitely take a break from their \u201chelp.\u201d Also, they should get their hearing checked again", "NTA. If they want to use the excuse of not hearing you like that. You can kindly tell them that until they get their ears checked it\u2019s just not safe for them to help with baby because what if they \u201ccan\u2019t\u201d hear baby in trouble?", "NTA. Nobody needs that kind of help. Also, your husband is an AH. Does he really not care more than that? At least he did take your side with his parents even if it was for the wrong reason. And what business is it of your BIL\u2019s. Someone should have told him to butt out. (SIL too but at least she was on the right side.)", "NTA. \n\nIt is near impossible for them to not have heared op FALL DOWN THE FUCKING STAIRS. Things coming down walls, glass braking,  a literal full adult human being crashing down a flight of stairs, and then 10 minutes of cries for help would be VERY difficult to overlook, especially as its coming from one open hallway away. I'm sure the grandparents knew and likely didn't care enough to get involved.", "I do think it's very suspicious that they claimed not to hear you, and wouldn't trust them after this until you get to the bottom of it. Did Debra's reaction seem genuine when you confronted her? Perhaps you should sit down with your husband (and SIL) and review any red flags from the past - any manipulative/sociopathic behavior you may have missed, etc. It's possible they might just be losing their marbles, if it's not their hearing. I don't want to assume the worst, but I'd issue an ultimatum that they can't see your baby until they provide a real explanation.", "NTA. Keep away from these people. They ignoref you on purpose. They wanted your injuries to get worse by waiting ten minutes to get to you. This is horror movie level stuff.", "This is honestly bizarre. I can't imagine any normal human being (let alone two!) actively ignoring someone that fell down the stairs and is calling them for help. Like wtf? I wouldn't want to be around such people ever again.", "The fact that SIL is on your side is telling. My guess is to them you are an incubator unless there's a bun in the oven you and your needs don't matter at least not until your lack of needs met impacts their babies. NTA", "There needs to be a ICB reply, because I Call Bullshit.", "Sometimes when the edits contain extremely crucial information, it kind of makes me believe they are made up.  \n\nIn your original post you said \"you asked for help\". You even suggested you weren't really even hurt much, just a little wobbly from the shock.\n\nThen all of a sudden your edit has a completely different picture.  You broke the banister, you knocked a bunch of books off something and you broke wall plates (not sure what those are).  Also all of a sudden you are screaming and crying for help.  I don't understand why you would be doing that for 10 minutes if you weren't even hurt. \n\nBased on your original post, it is extremely likely they didn't hear you.\n\nThey'd have to really hate you to know you fell and were screaming and purposefully ignore you and then play dumb about it.  But you've given no thing to suggest thst they were those kind of people.", "I\u2019m sure they heard you, almost wonder if they did something to cause the fall. And BIL is way out of line.

Like my dad is in his mid 60s now, and sometimes now he just totally zones out and I'll have to yell his name several times before he realizes I'm trying to get his attention. He's still mentally sharp and his hearing is totally fine, I just think once some people get old sound becomes background noise to whatever their thoughts/current activity is, and it can require a LOT of sound to pull them out of focus. Baby cries are a much more piercing sound than any adult typically can make, so it wouldn't surprise me if that was enough to pull them out of their current thoughts/activity but your yelling wasn't. \n\nHave the in laws previously been really neglectful of you or indicated they don't like you in some way? If this was the cherry on top of a huge neglectful cake that's one thing, but if you feel this way primarily because of this situation, I think maybe this is just more of a the in laws are getting old situation.", "YTA.

If that is true, then they shouldn't be looking after a baby unless they have hearing aides or other supports in place. If they literally ignored you while you were in obvious distress, then they shouldn't be looking after your child either.\n\nIf they are serious that they have hearing issues, then I would tell them they can't sit again until they have had thorough hearing tests and have appropriate supports put into place.", "NTA.

It\u2019s like some of y\u2019all find any excuse to shut out the other grandparents the first chance you get.  While you portray your own parents as walking on water. And as someone who didn\u2019t get along with my ex mil, I would never dream of withholding her grandchildren from her or my ex Fil.

Most grandparents are hypersensitive to their grandchildren. If this was a one off case, then they were probably oblivious because their focus was on the baby, who is more vulnerable.

Broken necks, blunt force to the head, a cut artery, etc were all results of people taking a tumble.

Even if that were true that they willingly ignored you, it is functionally the same as if they aren't there to help anyways. If you fall exactly the same way tomorrow when they're not there, the result is the same for you and worse for the baby. So all you're doing is punishing yourself by increasing your own workload with the house/baby over a matter of hurt feelings.\n\nNow, don't get me wrong here. Your change in opinion about their place in your lives is absolutely valid and is the part where you're NTA. If you're seeing their interactions in a new light as being that they don't care about you and only the baby, there is nothing wrong with that. So stop treating them like caring family members and treat them like free labor instead.\n\nIts pretty simple, you aren't feeling less safe with them around you just feel emotionally hurt that they either revealed or you perceive that they don't care about you.

OK yeah that sucks but hey if you no longer need their help then so be it. Be done with them. \u2026which I seriously believe this will end up being incorrect and you will in fact need their help in the future, you may have just shot your self in the foot, so don\u2019t be surprised if they get over doing you any favors.", "It\u2019s difficult to say on this. I get that you felt they ignored you - but what if they actually didn\u2019t hear you.

See if there is any way to work through things. \n\nI\u2019d like to think it was a misunderstanding and it is difficult to believe they could willfully just leave you there calling for help without checking on you.

But it was painful and I was screaming.", "I really wonder if they hoped that you quiet down the natural way...

He didn't take your side because you are his wife and he has your back, no, because you are the mother. Even he reduces you to this role. And the parents just have eyes for the child. Are you more than an incubator on two legs?!", "Even YOUR BABY heard the commotion!! That's why he was crying!\n\nYou said it yourself, baby started crying afterwards.

The baby is crying *and you're just gone?* Please, I do not know what they thought was happening, but unless they're addled they knew you were missing.", "They heard you.", "You could have died. Their reaction is concerning at best. Trust your instincts. NTA.", "Stepping back from your hurt feelings (which you are 100% entitled to, and I would encourage you to explore this more deeply with your husband, who ought to be equally horrified that they would treat you this way), there are two possible explanations for their actions that have zero to do with your interpretations or personal reaction and everything to do with your child\u2019s safety:\n\n1. They have severe deficits, either in cognitive ability (they heard a terrible crash, the baby is fine, an adult is screaming for help, but they can\u2019t make the connection to \u201cI should take an action to assist this other person\u201d) or in their five senses (hearing, for example they can\u2019t hear any noise more than a foot away or any sound with a lower pitch than a screaming baby, or sight, for example they suffer from a very narrow field of vision and can\u2019t see any motion outside of whatever is exactly in their direct line of sight). In either case, this is dangerous around a baby, who is helpless and depends on adults not just for feeding and comfort, but, for example, identifying unsafe environs, stranger danger, and so forth, and needs the capacity to react appropriately. I\u2019m not saying that a deaf person can\u2019t care for a baby, of course, but someone who is deaf and doesn\u2019t know or acknowledge that and take steps to adjust for it (like installing flashing lights in place of a smoke alarm) is not an appropriate caretaker. \n\n2. They are legitimately uninterested in your well being, not even out of hostility, but because you literally are of no value to them other than birthing their grandchild, and they don\u2019t see that as wrong enough to have even thought to hide it. This is really scary, and the kind of character trait that is often associated with a personality disorder, but even if they are just supremely selfish and only care for \u201cblood\u201d relatives but are otherwise not mentally disordered, this makes them unfit to care for a child because they lack a core empathy and desire to help any fellow being in danger *even when it would have cost them nothing*. We as a species rely on an innate desire to protect and help the helpless (cute babies, yes, but also someone who is hurt and needs assistance, even an adult, especially if there is no danger to the samaritan in helping). When we see someone who doesn\u2019t have that common drive, we are rightfully concerned. Think of it this way, if a stranger fell onto the railroad tracks in front of a speeding train, and your FIL / MIL stood passively by without trying to help at all, you\u2019d agree they were \u2026 off, right? Not right in the head? This is similar. It cost them nothing to help you and they still didn\u2019t. This means they are operating under a different ethos than everyone else expects, and you can\u2019t know how that will play out in all other cases. What if your BIL\u2019s child is also there and they are watching both? Do they value one more than the other and will they ignore one child in favor of the other? If either your FIL or MIL is hurt while watching your baby, will they ignore your child because their mate is more important in their hierarchy? If one day they are watching the baby and an episode of Maury comes on about cheating wives, and they get the random idea that your child is not your husband\u2019s, genetically, will they just fail to help the baby and walk out because now they think it isn\u2019t their blood? You can\u2019t predict how they might act in any given situation, and that\u2019s extremely concerning.\n\nIn either situation above, there\u2019s a serious issue that has nothing to do with you and everything to do with the safety and well-being of your child (to say nothing of the effects on a child of growing up watching it\u2019s mother treated badly). \n\nOf course, we all know they just ignored you because they only care about the baby (SIL agreeing is a HUGE confirmation here, by the way - they see women as incubators providing continuation for their genetic line, but that\u2019s it). But even if your husband wants to believe that\u2019s not true (yikes), their behavior is still a huge risk to his child and they should not be there unsupervised, nor should you be expected to supervise them while you are busy caring for your child.", "They don\u2019t give a shit about you, from the sounds of it. Do you really want them helping to raise your child? Yikes. Good luck getting hubby to agree though. He may be delusional when it comes to his own parents. Hopefully not.

I'm forever grateful that somehow he wound up being okay, but, years later,  I'm still traumatized by the sound of him falling to the point where loud noises (especially people running up/down stairs) spike my heart rate and trigger a panic response. \n\nA human adult falling makes a huge amount of sound.

So why add more stress to your plate?", "OP, I\u2019m very late to this thread and don\u2019t usually comment on older posts - I know you\u2019re likely to be too overwhelmed by responses to see this, but your story has made me SO angry! You are 10000% NTA and I am so glad you read other\u2019s comments about the hearing issue - that\u2019s definitely the argument you can use to get his parents to step back without them being able to play the victims. They can\u2019t use the \u201cyour feelings are hurt but we just didn\u2019t hear you, you\u2019re punishing us\u201d argument. You\u2019re looking out for the safety of their grand baby after all.\n\nYou do also have a boyfriend problem that needs to be addressed. As I\u2019m super petty, I would genuinely be going into full science experiment mode if I were you. He needs to fully understand how ludicrous their argument is and the only way to get there is with a demonstration. \n\nHere\u2019s how I\u2019d science him out of this nonsense:\n- First I\u2019d bring him into the living room, get him to hold the baby (who will probably cry), then head to the top of the stairs and chuck a few books down.\n- I\u2019d then stand and scream the way you did, in exactly the same spot, and ask if it was even remotely possible not to hear.\n- To avoid any \u201cI couldn\u2019t hear you properly\u201d arguments, I\u2019d also stick a voice recorder in the living room beforehand to pick up the noise and play it back to him, to doubly prove my point.\n- Then, when his parents are around, I\u2019d bring the baby upstairs and drop something heavy on the floor. I can say with 99% certainty that they would come frantically running within seconds if they thought the baby was in danger following any concerning noises. When they appear, I\u2019d play dumb and ask them if they have managed to get their hearing fixed, because it seems to be doing so much better \u201cI was so clumsy, I just drooped a book I was moving, baby is fine\u201d.\n- Finally, to really hammer the point home, I\u2019d sit my partner down and run through the statistics of how many people (of all ages) die from falling each year (the numbers are pretty high), how often a fall down the stairs results in life altering injuries and how statistically, the sooner medical intervention happens after a potentially fatal accident, the higher the survival rate is. \n- I\u2019d also bring in some stories of people who suffered head injuries, were conscious and speaking but still succumbed to their injuries later on. It happens, even if they admitted to hearing you shouting, you could still have had an unknown injury that could have killed you. You were SO lucky to have emerged without permanent injury from that fall (but I am sorry you have been in so much pain after it), but his parents neglect could have cost you your life.\n\nBasically, your partner needs to internalise just how horrendously his parents behaved and understand how close you came to tragedy. If he says that everything is fine because you weren\u2019t unconscious and they will have known that from your shouting (or a similar argument) then you have your confirmation that they knew. If he tells you that you are being dramatic, ask him if he\u2019d be comfortable relying on the help of people he KNEW thought so little of him that they would ignore him in a crisis.\n\nIf, when confronted with all these facts, he STILL chooses to only side with you \u201cbecause you\u2019re the mother\u201d, I\u2019d be making my plans to leave from that point on. I\u2019d be speaking with lawyers to make sure my baby is 100% protected from his god awful parents, citing this incident as an example of how frail and clearly incapable they are of being around an infant unsupervised. I\u2019d be looking into custody agreements that prohibit them from spending any time alone with my child without me present, as the child\u2019s father clearly couldn\u2019t see any danger in the lack of awareness of their surroundings (which resulted in the breakup of the relationship). I would come armed with pictures of my injuries, the cracked bannister and even the mess left over (I hope you took some after the fall) to illustrate just how oblivious they clearly are. Basically; I\u2019d be going full scorched earth.\n\nA caveat here is that I don\u2019t know how vulnerable you are, so if you think there is a chance they could leverage their wealth to take your baby from you, or punish you in other ways, please exercise caution. This is mostly just the rankings of an internet stranger who is furious on your behalf. The same goes for the \u201cscience\u201d experiment. If you think there\u2019s a chance your boyfriend could lash out either physically or with verbal abuse, then please don\u2019t follow these ideas. The most important thing is that you and your baby are, and remain, safe. There are much quieter ways to leave that may be better suited to your circumstances.\n\nOP, I really hope you take a moment to step back and think about whether this is the life you want for yourself. Family relationships are complex and often difficult to navigate, but it\u2019s clear that your partner\u2019s default is to side with his parents and make you the bad guy, even when hundreds of internet strangers can objectively see that you\u2019ve been mistreated. If he\u2019s not going to side with you when there is overwhelming evidence that his parents  intentionally neglected you (at your most vulnerable), will he ever side with you in a disagreement with them? You deserve so much more than that. \n\nI could not care less about how much money these people have spent \u201con you\u201d - no number is high enough to ever justify such deliberate disregard of another human being. They do not own you and you have every right to decide you are worth more than their callous, hateful actions.\n\nTake care of yourself and your LO OP.\n\nPs edited for bullet point formatting", "idk how her house is laid out but i have a feeling the stairs are close enough to the living room in most houses that you would hear a grown person falling and yelling but maybe i\u2019m wrong", "I can\u2019t remember if the OP ever even updated!

And if I DIDN'T demand some answers on that subject then my wife would have every right to be angry with me.\n\nIt seems like OP's boyfriend is just passively accepting her demands regarding the family without actually being on board. He seems extremely unconcerned with this whole situation, which is weird, because no matter what happened there's something alarming in the mix.\n\n1. If the story as OP tells it is true, his parents ignored her screams for help while she was on the ground injured. That's alarming, and means they shouldn't be babysitting.\n\n2. If the parents' excuse that they couldn't hear a woman screaming bloody murder from within the same house is true, then they are both deaf as posts and probably need hearing aids immediately before there's another accident. Sudden deafness is alarming, and also means they shouldn't be babysitting.\n\n3. If OP is exaggerating this whole thing and she wasn't that badly hurt, didn't yell that loudly, and wasn't really ignored then his girlfriend and the mother of his child is a crazy person, which is also alarming and means SHE might need to be observed closely while she has the baby.

The baby is 7 months old and the grandparents are STILL coming over (what seems almost daily) to help her. Maybe next time she shouldn\u2019t call them for help at all. But, my guess is as a 21 yr old mother, she\u2019s going to need their help, BIL has already stated the grandparents have helped financially, so makes me believe these young parents aren\u2019t totally independent and will be calling upon the grandparents in the near future.  I doubt these people are as malicious as she makes them out to be. I highly doubt they\u2019d be helping with the baby AND household chores if they were.", "Imaginary babies are really hard work.

It's one thing to maliciously do something to someone you don't like. It's another to maliciously do something **where there is no conceivable way you aren't found out doing it.** \n\nIf OP legitimately fell down the stairs, the more plausible scenario is she stayed quiet, and then lied about yelling for help because she wanted a reason to kick out her inlaws. \n\nPersonally I think the whole thing is made up though.", "Youve summarised the NTA votes here lmao", "Respectfully, not breaking anything doesn\u2019t mean that it didn\u2019t hurt or bruise something.

How could they argue with that?", "NTA. I don\u2019t like that comment about your parents\u2019 financial status from your BIL. Like others have said they heard you they just chose to ignore you.
