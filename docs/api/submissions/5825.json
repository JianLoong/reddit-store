We\u2019ve had the dogs since they were puppies. \n\nSome background. Our male dog is an angel, he potty trained himself, crate trained easily, just been an all around easy dog. Our female dog has been extremely difficult, she\u2019s been impossible to keep home since she was a puppy, nothing we\u2019ve done works long term. They prefer to be outside generally if they have a choice. We live in a rural area on about 70 acres of land. We built a fence around our back yard and built them a door that goes into a room in our garage that is heated and cooled. This seemed to keep them happy since they could come inside when they want and be outside with access to a climate controlled area. Recently (since we got her fixed) our female has been doing anything she can to run away, digging under the fence, trying to chew through the fence, anything. \n\nNow to the issue, due to the snow that just happened there\u2019s massive snow drifts in our backyard that reach the top of our fence. Our dogs jumped over the fence and went over to our neighbors. She called my husband and told him our dogs were there, I was home but I was putting our daughter to bed (hence why I didn\u2019t see it or I would\u2019ve stopped them). Our neighbor is an older lady who loves our dogs, she often comes over in the summer with her grandkids to play with them. My husband called me while I was rocking our daughter so I declined the call, finished rocking her and then called him back. He wanted me to go pick them up I said I wasn\u2019t comfortable leaving our daughter at home alone to go pick them up. He said it wouldn\u2019t be a big deal for me to. So I called our neighbor and told her the situation and she said she was happy to keep them there until my husband could get there (which would be within the hour). I told my husband I didn\u2019t feel comfortable doing it and our neighbor was okay with keeping them so I wouldn\u2019t be leaving our daughter to go get them. He told me I was being an overprotective mom and I needed to think about how upside down my thinking was.

There's no emergency so there's no reason to do it.", "NTA\n\nBut more importantly why is there even a post about this? In what world would it be okay to leave a baby at home alone?

And maybe, a bad father; to even consider leaving a sleeping child that young home while you go down the street to a neighbor to get the dogs. There is no need for niceties on this with him. Straight up and tell him to F off, and never consider leaving your child alone in such a manner again. Anything could happen, including the hard to imagine in that situation he suggests. \n\nI would consider talking to in-laws about this. I doubt they would share your husband's feelings of leaving such a young child home alone, asleep, to walk such a distance to retrieve a couple of dogs. Even ones loved as family.", "What in the world? Of course NTA!

Oh, that you would be you, not him.\n\nSince your neighbor is so kind, it was absolutely the easy answer to stay home with your kid.  If she was not kind, then you'd have to bundle your kid up in the car and go.

What if something happened to you when you were gone and you couldn't get back to the baby?  What if something happened at the home when you weren't there?

For all the people making excuses about the snowdrift; what do you think would happen if the dog caused an injury and the OP was taken to court?\n\nAlso, YTA for declining your husband\u2019s call.

My husband is self employed and works extremely long hours (6 days a week, 15-18 hour days) so there isn\u2019t a time he\u2019s solely responsible for her. We knew it would be like this going into having a baby.  \nHe is so incredibly intelligent on so many things but there\u2019s an obvious gap in parenting knowledge when he\u2019s literally never had to do it alone and since he doesn\u2019t get to be home much he doesn\u2019t understand how babies are or what taking care of them entails.", "Why? Maybe will scream and turn off, which is in good. But I don\u2019t see how the child will be in danger as long as it cannot leave its bed.", "Wakes up or worse, someone tries to break in too! Like noo way in HELL I'd leave a small child home alone in a neighborhood nah uh! Even a relatively safe one.", "He hasn\u2019t ever been the one solely responsible for her ever unless you count me sleeping in on Sunday mornings while he cares for her.

Hindsight is 20/20. \n\nIf I would\u2019ve seen them going over the fence I would\u2019ve stopped them. I passively allowed them to go by not making sure the snowdrift was taken care of but I didn\u2019t watch them do it and just be whatever about it. \n\nMy husband isn\u2019t second best.

What if she had an accident there or on the way back?", "Or the house catches on fire. Or she wrecks her car since it\u2019s snowy.", "Sounds like they're out in the country. So it's much more likely she could get stuck in the snow. So she either she has to walk and who knows how long before she's home. Or she has to dig herself out or  has to wait for someone to dig her out. Which adds time that she's gone. Since it's winter, a pipe could burst at any moment (just had this problem) . That could trigger an electrical short which causes a fire. If she's home, they both get out safely. If she's not home, bye bye baby. That's why you don't ever leave kids alone.", "Yikes. I hope you have enough help and sleep.", "So... Do you really not see anything wrong with the fact that your husband has not provided solo care for his child in an entire year? That's... Really weird. And not great. He's just as much her parent as you are, and he should not only know how to care for her solo, but be comfortable and familiar with it. Good forbid something happened to you, he would be totally unprepared. You should really start making him assume more longer-term solo care sessions for her, including bc you should be able to go out on your own without having to worry.", "\u201cI passively allowed them to go\u201c is another word for neglect.

And yeah I agree there is too much that can go wrong.", "Yeah it was neglectful to not shovel the snowdrift and they got out. This post isn\u2019t about how crappy we already feel about them getting out and going to the neighbors or how we would feel if they hurt or killed for being on someone else\u2019s property. We already feel all those things. This post is about me leaving our daughter at home to go get them. I don\u2019t need you to tell me how wrong it was that they got out. I already know, I already feel awful about it and the snowdrift will be shoveled before we go to bed tonight after we make sure our dogs are okay.\n\nEdited for typos", "Of course anything can happen at anytime but it is about risk mitigation.\n\nDon't leave an infant alone in the house is a pretty well known thing.", "Apparently you did need me to say it, because you appeared to be making excuses.  I\u2019m glad you finally understand where you went wrong. Take care."]}
