So my friend screen shotted this and sent it to the principal and I got in trouble. After I talked to the principal I messaged my friend who sent the screenshot called her a bitch, told her to fuck herself, and I blocked her. Now I have to apologize even though I don\u2019t feel like I did anything wrong, also the principal has said if I don\u2019t give my mom access to my snapchat (username + password) I will be suspended. AITA?\nEdit: the story wasn\u2019t what got me suspended I was suspended because the language I used wasn\u2019t tolerated.

Because I don't see why the principal would warrant suspending you over a snapchat rant about societal problems these days. I'm guessing you said a lot more and you're just leaving it out of this post.", "INFO: what details are you keeping from us about this snap you made? Nothing you described here would give the principal the ability to suspend you.", "Yep YTA. \nProbably the initial post wasn\u2019t the problem. Probably your friend sending it to the principal was an overreaction. But your reaction to THAT is what makes  you TA. \nCan\u2019t comment on giving your Snapchat pw to your mom.

Sending negative messages to your classmates is also considered bullying. \n\nOn the one hand it is wise to keep your social media squeaky clean for when you are applying to schools and jobs. On the other hand I think that also promotes trying to look perfect rather than just being yourself. Kudos to you for having a strong voice! Don\u2019t let anyone diminish that voice, and hopefully you use it for good:)", "Oh yeah\u2026YTA alright", "I don't think it really matters if we think you're the AH because everyone in your story has already made that decision.
