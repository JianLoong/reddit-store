Issues that she has not gotten help for or a diagnosis. She was diagnosed with PTSD and severe depression years ago and CPS told her since she had mental disabilities that she was incapable of taking care of her kid. Now she outright refuses to get help for this exact reason. She doesn't want to be labeled and then have DHHS on her doorstep again. Her trauma and fear surrounding this IS valid so please don't pull the \"she's an AH for not getting help\" argument. She tried and the system failed her.\n\nA few things are incredibly obvious. Like I know for a fact she has OCD tendencies, ADHD and sensory issues (on top of her PTSD). Repetitive noises (ie: dogs licking themselves, dogs nails on the floor walking behind her, dogs drinking water, dogs barking/whining). She loves dogs. Hates the noises they make. Every noise. It drives her mental. She gets overloaded incredibly quickly with the noises. To a point of not wanting to go to my sister or mother's house unless she's outdoors because she cannot stand being surrounded with 3 dogs (they both have 3 dogs each) and the continuous sounds they make or the amount of dog hair on everything. She will invite them to our place all day long but cannot stand going to their houses. \n\nWell, this past weekend was my neices 8th grade graduation/party following and despite her not wanting to go because of the dogs, she sucked it up for our nieces sake. Within an hour she was ready to rip her hair out. The dogs were at her feet the entire time and wouldn't leave her alone. One of them is an excessive licker and that was driving her bat shit crazy. One of them is a whiner as well so that didn't go over well. She goes outside to the car and put her head on the steering wheel. I go out and ask what's wrong (I genuinely didnt know at this point) and she just about snapped. She said \"if I have to be around those dogs for 5 more fucking minutes and listen to them licking themselves and whining I'm truly going to yeet myself off the nearest building.\" But she was angry when she said it. Partially yelling. So I told her to quiet it down and stop acting like a psycho and we would leave soon. She looked at me like I was a dick, started the car and took off. Went to her mom's house and she's been there since. She says I'm a \"fucking prick\" for making her feel invalidated.\n\nETA: there are definitely more noises that bother her but the issue is the dogs for this scenario so those are the only issues I outlined. And to be clear: my fianc\u00e9 is a damn good woman and has many coping mechanisms that work for her- hence why she removed herself from the equation without causing a scene. I simply didn't like being snapped at.", "created_utc": 1686331016, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/145b2v3/aita_for_calling_her_a_psycho_over_her_freaking/", "score": 115, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I make sure my dog/cats aren't all over my guests *unless* the guests are enthusiastic about the attention.  It's not difficult to redirect a dog or tell them to go stay on their mat if they're well trained, and as a dog owner it is your responsibility to run interference if your dog is trying to get attention from a guest who finds the dog's proximity unwelcome.

I have dogs and, if I knew someone had sensory issues like this, I absolutely would not let my dogs remain right under their feet or whining at/near them\u2026especially not for *an hour*. That would drive me mad as a dog owner, never mind someone with sensory issues tied to dogs.\n\nDid she actually elect to be in this environment by choice, or did she go because she was expected to/there would be repercussions for not going? Your use of the phrase \u201cshe sucked it up\u201d is worrying. If she\u2019s in a really unstable place right now, she should not have to do that or feel like she has to. \n\nIt sounds like she\u2019s definitely in need of a real psychiatric assessment and support, but I can understand why she doesn\u2019t want to go down that path if, the last time she tried to, she felt like someone was going to take her child away.

That being said, I doubt you did it on purpose or meant it, we all make mistakes, but you must understand some mistakes hurt, and somethings they cut deep.\n\nBut! I see many red flags from your partner here. A refusal to get help and projecting those issues to the world around her are major big ones.\n\nIt seems like some difficult conversations are to come, at the end of the day she really needs to get help for her problems. This is the core of the issues here and an absolute refusal to work on those issues will present problems in the future.", "Dude you need to find a new fianc\u00e9", "ESH - her for not trying to calm herself down (there are A LOT of self help techniques she could learn/research) and you for your poor choice of words.", "NTA. She needs to get herself sorted out and stop guilt tripping with the building thing. \ud83e\udd13", "ESH. You for calling her a psycho, like, obviously. Her for not getting help. \n\nHer issues are not her fault but they are HER responsibility.", "ESH Your fianc\u00e9e has misophonia as do I. I also am a huge dog lover.\n\nWhen they lick themselves or drink water I use earplugs or leave the room. Your fianc\u00e9e should have taken your niece out for a separate celebration or worn earplugs.\n\nYou shouldn\u2019t spend your life catering to your wife\u2019s issues, but you shouldn\u2019t call her a psycho.\n \nThe owners of the dog who licks excessively should talk to their veterinarian. Excessive licking is usually a symptom of allergies and/or dermatological problems.", "She has misophonia. It's a fucking NIGHTMARE. I have straight up almost quit my job in a fit of tears due to it. I have cut off friends. I have skipped family events. I have punched myself in the face, legs and have cut myself open in the past because pain distracts me from it and was (at one time) the only thing I knew to do to cope. It's not fun at all. \n\nShe needs to get it addressed though. I started taking meds and seeing a therapist a few years ago and it's been a bit helpful. Also where I learned I have OCPD, which was a huge finding for me.\n\nYTA, the OP. She needs your support. She literally can not help it as it is right now. It's programmed in her brain, and that is NOT easy to get over. You're marginalizing her by calling her psycho, not cool. \n\nI stopped talking to my sister because she called me \"crazy\" over this condition.", "Yes definitely YTA", "I've asked my sister to redirect the dogs in the past but she's very much so a \"this is my dog's house and you are a guest here\".", "Put the damn dogs outside or lock them in a bedroom. It's not that hard.", "It's so hard to get dogs to quit kicking. The whining idk about I don't have a dog that whines. My dog however will lick you for about 2 minutes straight the first time she sees you that day and possibly if she wants something, but that's not very often. I've tried everything I could think of to get her to stop for 2 years and she won't. So it's definitely difficult, even with a lot of patience, to get a dog to stop licking people", "What's misophonia? Is it manageable without meds? I want to help her.", "It sounds like OP would be the big winner in that scenario.", "Look at OP's reply about the abuse their fiancee suffered.  \nI'm actually shaking in anger. \n\nOP's fiance went to foster care because her parents cared more about taking care of their dogs than their own child (OP) and through foster care, OP was pregnant with the child through assault and I just... I'm TREMBLING in anger.", "It's even worse than that! She has trauma from being put into foster care because her parents worried more about their dogs than her!! And that's not even the worst part if you read OP's comments.. I feel so horrible for the fiance! She needs to leave OP. OP, YTA X 1000.", "She didn't volunteer or anything. It was more of a \"well it's expected of me so I guess I have no choice\". She cares a lot about what people think of her so she didn't want to put ill thoughts in people's heads by not attending.", "I am perfectly fine \"dealing with\" her issues. Her problems do not bother me. I simply didn't like being snapped at for asking a question. She is in therapy, she just won't be evaluated. She also won't let her therapist put her on medications out of fear of getting another label that the state will take and run with.", "I outlined why she isn't getting help. Her trauma surrounding it is valid and I don't blame her. DHHS didn't try to help her at all. They threatened to take her kid instead. She manages it by using her own coping mechanisms that work for her, like removing herself from the situation. I simply don't like being snapped at.", "I explained why she won't get help and I don't blame her one bit. Her PTSD is severe (directly linked to neglectful parents who chose their dogs over her to a point of ending up in foster care for years AND sustaining ab*se by 3 men at one time) and she begged the hospital for help. They chained her to a bed and called DHHS and DHHS tried taking her son from her (a son conceived during the abuse). Furthering her PTSD but taking it in a different direction. The system failed her immensely and I don't blame her one but for not attempting to get help again. Medication wise. She's in therapy. That's the only reason she knew to remove herself from the house to decompress before she snapped. No one in that house knew there was an issue. I did because she told me. She puts up a very good front in front of people because she has learned to mask her fear, pain and struggles so people don't say she's incapable of caring for her kids.", "It\u2019s literally the absolute worst. It\u2019s so hard to explain that certain sounds just bring on an irrational, overwhelming rage and even physical discomfort sometimes.", "Then I think you need to be clear with your sister that this will impact you and your fiance's ability to attend events at her house.  The dogs are an issue for your fiance, and if your sister is going to refuse to manage her dogs so that your fiance can be comfortable, then you will need to leave as soon as your fiance reaches her limit.  And possibly not attend some things at all.\n\nManners are important, even for dogs.  Just because you're a guest in someone's home does not mean you just need to put up with mannerless behavior from the people or animals who live there.  If your sister is not going to insist her dogs have manners with guests (which is a basic ask, tbh), then your gf should be free to decline to be around her poorly behaved dogs and free to leave whenever she's overwhelmed.  And you should support her in that.\n\nAnd if your sister has an issue, tell her to train her dogs and enforce manners around guests.", "YTA\n\nThen you leave her house! She is a bad host and if she doesn't care about the comfort of guests, why would you even stay there?\n\nShe didn't want to go already, you knew why, and instead of helping or saying she could skip it, you sided with your sister because \"it's her house\" (??!) Not only that, you blamed your fianc\u00e9 and called her a psycho.", "You can call the dogs to you and pet them for a while to give her a break. You could make an agreement with your girlfriend that she only has to stay at maximum of a half an hour come in different cars and let her leave when her half an hour is up. You can stay all damn day if you want nobody cares what you do.", "Try Loop ear plugs. They partially filter sound and can make distracting or annoying background sounds less obvious while still allowing the wearer to hear something like a TV show or a direct conversation.", "She *was* managing it. She removed herself from the problem so she could take a moment to breathe and calm herself before going back in. \n\nThat is a healthy way to deal with misophonia when it gets to extreme levels, like when multiple people are talking to you at once while a dog licks itself next to you, after you have already been in the middle of everything for quite a while. \n\nAnd you called her a psycho - that's probably a word she's hugely sensitive to given her past (and just plain thoughtlessly cruel coming from someone who allegedly cares about her). \n\nYTA and maybe *you* should speak to a therapist about your lack of empathy.", "Did a quick Google search. Looks like it says it's a strong reaction to specific sounds and is very rare and also self diagnosable. Treatment sounds like therapy, noise protection (think noise cancelling headphones or ear plugs) and creating quiet spaces. It seems like your wife already does the last one by removing herself from the situation", "This comment here also tells me you shouldn\u2019t be with your fianc\u00e9. Why does it matter if she would need meds or not, help is help. If she needs meds to help her cope more why should it matter? It would be one thing if she didn\u2019t try to have coping skills or anything but by your own admission she\u2019s a good woman who knows to deal with her issues. YTA", "It sure doesn't sound like you want to help her, control her yup, but help? On what planet would your AH reaction help anyone with anything?", "YTA and how about a thing called google?", "You\u2019re on Reddit, don\u2019t you know how to Google it? If not you can scroll through the comments because several people gave very detailed explanation of that.", "You could start by not calling her a psycho.", "Then she really needs to get some help. Not doing so when you know you have problems and there are options to access the care you need is an AH move. The fiancee needs to start being proactive in her own treatment and stop sticking her head in the proverbial sand.", "Chill out, it's just a reddit post.", "Did you try to get the dogs to leave her alone? And why were you confused about what the problem was when you know she has this issue with dogs?", "Dude she was over stimulated and when people with neurodivergence and mental health issues are over stimulated they are reactive. You claim to be supportive but when it mattered you weren't. \n\nI absolutely cannot stand the sound of dogs licking it drives me insane and sometimes when I'm around it I get snippish bc I am entering a state of overstimulation and bc of my autism it's very hard to regulate and respond reasonably at those times. I have only been recently diagnosed so I am still learning to cope but my partner would never react by calling my a psycho. They may tell me after I've calmed down they didn't like how I reacted but they would never ever use name calling. \n\nIf you want to be supportive learn how to actually be supportive, ask if you can some sessions with her therapist and ask for methods you can use to actually help her in these situations. (if she forgives you that is, I'm honestly not sure I could forgive a partner who knew my issues and triggers calling me psycho). \n\nAlso massive YTA", "Except you weren't dealing with her issues. She was over stimulated and venting, she wasn't snapping at you. And you knew she was having trouble, took it personally, and decided to resort to name calling. And not just name calling but something that you know she's incredibly sensitive about. You are not a support system right now. You chose to attack her.", "You got snapped at because you followed her when she was taking a break, then judged her instead of supporting her.", "You put her in a situation you knew was stressful then acted like a shocked Pikachu when you asked why she was in the car and she snapped that she's being harassed by 3 dogs nonstop.", "What did you expect to happen when you called her a psycho? You know her difficulties and you should have been more supportive. YTA.", "Holy shit.\n\nReading this, SEEING this, you KNOWING the extent of how hard the trauma was, and you called her a psycho in response to her snapping at you because you thought it was rude? YTA so hard. I hope she dumps you. That's just... holy shit. You are cruel.", "So you know all this, but you still called her psycho because she snapped at you when  she was rediculasly over stimulated because your family put their dogs above your fianc\u00e9's sanity", "So you're even worse. She is trying the hardest she can, and you barely helped her here. YOU should be the one to talk with your family and tell them that they must listen to her and the accommodations she will need. If they won't accept that, then its still YOUR PLACE to tell YOUR family that the both of you can not attend if they dont respect her. The bottom line is that if they dont respect what she needs to manage her illnesses, then they dont respect her.\n\nPlease realize that you are not doing as good by her as you may believe. Stop diagnosing her yourself. You do not know enough.", ">I explained why she won't get help and I don't blame her one bit.

You're now just another person she'll have to mask in front of. \n\nAt least now she knows that when she needs help she'll get none from you.", "The fact that you put so little thought towards your fianace's well being, needs and comfort while being fully aware of her past traumas and abuse, is frankly gross.\n\nYou KNOW that she was abandoned by her parents who put their dogs over their own child and yet, here you are.. putting your sister's / mother's dogs before her. Just like her parents did and yet... you can't see how the two situations are mirror images? You really don't see that you're putting your fianc\u00e9 through the same trauma she experienced as a child? \n\nYou are aware of all this and yet, you make her sit there and have her personal space encroached by dogs her whole visit because  they dont listen to you and your sister had declared that it's the dog's home so they have precedence over your fiance? And you agree. You agree by allowing it to happen, time and time again. \n\nThis is just the first time fiance has gotten angry about it. She didn't even get directly angry at you, she was angry about the dogs. And you decided to name call? You used the word Psycho specifically. Why?\n\nYou don't seem to respect or even understand what she's gone through, what she is going through with her child, what she is going through with you. You are just another person in her life who is not making her a priority and treating her like she isn't deserving of basic consideration. \n\nI really hope she finds a way out because I'm getting a hint of something more malicious going on. Especially after reading some of your replies. I just can't see how you keep feigning ignorance about not knowing how this could be making her feel.", "I just got these for my bf! I really hope they help (loops)", "I have some on my key ring for when I'm around people that trigger my misophonia!", "I keep getting these advertised at me. Do they really work?", "It's right in the first paragraph, she doesn't want to get medical help because of past trauma surrounding getting medical help.\n\nHe's still an asshole for the outburst and using a word like \"psycho\".", "OP did state that she is in therapy and on medication, and I noticed there are contradictions in many places from OP that look like they're made to fit his narrative. I kind of suspect it might be an abusive situation with OP, unfortunately, and that the fianc\u00e9e is actually being as proactive as she can and going to her parents might have been one of the first huge steps to getting out. Some of the things said (especially with inconsistencies) are alarmingly similar to my situation. Sure, that absolutely could be projection on my end but you know how sometimes you recognize signs if that makes sense?", "This.", "I did try to get the dogs away from her, yes but I feel the damage was probably already done at that point. At first we went off and did our own thing (I was hanging out with my uncle that I hadn't seen in years and she was with my sister) so I didn't see how bad it was until I walked inside and saw her ready to snap with a dog licking herself on her feet. So I did try but again, it was already past the point. \n\nNow, given that she does have a lot of sensory triggers, I didn't immediately put two and two together about the dogs. I didn't know if it was because she was being bombarded with conversation from every direction (she gets overwhelmed with multiple conversations at once because she can't focus on anything being said) or if it was the dogs or if it was because she was being asked to help out with everything. All of these things could have been potential triggers.", "Exactly this she did the appropriate thing to help herself regulate and you barged in and asked her what was wrong and got so offended by her snapping you resorted to name calling. \n\nI'm not sure if you are actually as supportive as you claim if you can't see why she snapped and how calling her a psycho was wrong", "Hard to see how he can be so understanding yet so intolerant of her issues at the same time... It's really something.", "Honestly I feel like he's using her struggles as a \"look how much of a great guy I am because of my suffering, etc etc etc.\" And I'm guessing that it's more along the veins of this post with his behavior IRL. My abusive ex said she dated me because I looked like a kicked puppy and she wanted to \"fix me\" but I became unattractive when I started getting better so she wanted to break me again. Honestly same vibes."]}
