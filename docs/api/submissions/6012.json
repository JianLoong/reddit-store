He is a veteran of the US army and values his military service as a very important part of himself and his history. He served for eight years before he was honorably discharged. \n\nI gave birth to our son M nearly two months ago, on November 11th. It's a long way away from his next birthday, but we've still been discussing the logistics of how we're going to handle future holidays now that we have a baby. My husband is very particular about those kinds of things, and he really likes having an idea of how things will go a long time in advance. \n\nIt finally came up that he had been born on Veterans Day, which my husband obviously knew but I don't know if it sank in at the time. I told him that I intended to celebrate our son's birthday on November 11th, and we could have our Veterans Day dinner the day after. My husband was angry, and said that it's unreasonable to move a whole holiday when the whole US is celebrating on that day, and that we could celebrate M's birthday the day prior or the next day. \n\nWe still haven't come to an agreement. He thinks I'm an asshole for disrespecting his military service when the baby won't know his birthday is being celebrated a day later, but I think our son's birthday is much more important.

Honestly while it\u2019s nice to get a discount on that day or a freebie, I\u2019ve always (and many other vets I know) find it uncomfortable to have my service called out. Like it was years ago and hubby and I are compensated by the VA for any injuries and get free medical for ours kids until they\u2019re 18 or 23 (if in school). I grew up with a relative who was born on Veterans Day and we are still close. Never once did it occur to me to also be celebrated on that day.

My mother's birthday is on Veteran's Day too. We also have several family members that are veterans. My mom's birthday is more of the focus, although we never forget to thank those for their service.\n\nWith this said, does your husband really want his son growing up feeling like he is second to his father's career? Because let's be honest, although military work can be honorable, at the end of the day... your child only recognizes that as his job or career. Why put your son second?", "Info: is he the type of person who will get really upset if someone doesn\u2019t thank him for his service to the country?", "NTA - being in the military is a job, and one he no longer operates in.

Tell him to get his priorities in order. My birthday falls on Memorial Day every few years and we take a few mins to pray for my dads brother and dad who also served in the military. My dad was USAF so it\u2019s important to him, but that compromise was something I chose to do because I love my dad.

You can celebrate the day before or after, or maybe even after he has gone to bed if your husband feels so strongly about it, but he cannot replace the birthday.

What does he want, his discount at the local diner?\n\nPoor kid, his dad cares more about being recognised for shooting people than he does about the kid.", "NTA. Your child should come first.

I'm confused as to why this needs to be contentious...", "NTA I work with a large group of veterans and have never met one that cared this much about Veterans Day.

Your husband says it's unreasonable to move a whole holiday, but it's cool to move your son's whole birthday...? \nWhile I respect Veteran's Day, it seems your husband is putting that on a pedestal way more than your child's birthday, which is a tad jarring. Why can't both be celebrated?", "Veteran wife here\u2026\u2026..\n\nYour husband needs to stop identifying himself as a veteran only. I personally know vets who make a big deal out of being a vet. They ask for discounts wherever they go, they want rewards for what they did, etc., etc. \n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, I respect the sacrifices that they did and the consequences that they deal with especially PTSD. I will reach out and wish them a happy Veterans Day and acknowledge their service. \n\nThat being said, your husband needs to now come to the realization that he is a father now and that trumps being a vet. He needs to identify as a father, husband, son etc as well as being a vet. \n\nYou can celebrate both on that day. Morning breakfast for him (where he can get his discount) and lunch/dinner for your child. And really, as he starts to grow, most of child\u2019s birthdays will be party\u2019s held on weekends when the holiday falls on a weekday. \n\nGrow up dad!

My daughter\u2019s bday sometimes falls on Thanksgiving day. We open presents in the morning, have thanksgiving dinner and cake.

I've been in the American Corporate workforce for 30+ years and I think I've worked every single Veterans day.  I'm also related to and friends with several veterans and i don't think any of them have made a big deal out of Veterans Day.\n\nAs with nearly all birthdays, you recognize it on the day you were born in some way, but if you're going to have a *party* you do it on a day that allows people to attend, which won't be a weekday.  You may want to move your son's birthday \\*party\\* to a Saturday to allow more people to attend.   Also, the 1st 3-4 birthdays for children are usually more about family gatherings than actually about the kid.  Once they get to 5 and have friends you start switching gears and inviting more of the kid's friends and less family.", "NTA.... I would guess there is a military subreddit....ask on there to see what vets say. That said...my FiL was a vet (career army, the corps of engineers, Vietnam and Korean vet. My husband is a vet. I have know and hung out with quite a few vets. Veterans day does not mean all that to them. They make sure to flag is flying but that's about it. Maybe in the future this will be something father and son can do when your son gets older.

Sit down and talk to him when all is calm.", "Why can't you celebrate both on the same day? My partner is a marine and we had planned to do breakfast, lunch, and dinner with the discounts and stuff he got since we are both fairly broke and we wanted to do something for our anniversary since it happened while he was away from home. You could do breakfast/lunch for your son and then do dinner for your husband or vice versa. Both are holidays that your family values, it's just a matter compromise. This way both get celebrated and you both get what you want.\n\nPersonally, I would do it this way. I see where your husband is coming from, but to make your son push his birthday (the one day a year that is meant for him) to another day just because he happened to be born on a national holiday is a bit mean, especially from dad. There would be no good way to go about this in my eyes other than what I stated above. I'm sure for now, your son won't care (since he's just been born), but if you always move his birthday because his dad wants to celebrate something else, eventually (just stating how I would feel) i think he'd be upset and wonder why his dad doesn't want to celebrate his birthday. \n\nMy judgment is that NAH. Dad is being a bit selfish imo, but I understand wanting to celebrate service.", "NTA, I\u2019m a veteran and his position is ridiculous. I was in for almost exactly 8 years and you know what, I have never celebrated myself on Veterans Day, not once. Yes, it\u2019s important but I\u2019ve found most normal people that have served aren\u2019t hung up on the fact that they did. Now people who\u2019s entire self image comes from it, oh yea they totally do and it\u2019s obnoxious. Your child\u2019s birthday is more important and if anything it can be a combined celebration. He needs to get some help.", "NTA why couldnt he be proud that his kid was born on that day? \n\nMy husband has served for 25 years, still in, and he definitely doesn't make that day a big ordeal. That's one weird hill, especially when it's his child.\n\nETA: I asked my husband to weigh in. He basically said why not celebrate both the same day, and asked how we celebrate... we don't. Lolol", "NTA, as someone who retired after 23 years I can tell you that he is being completely ridiculous. Your son is far more important to celebrate, is he recommending to move your sons birthday celebration as well? As your son frowns older he\u2019s going to see that a holiday is more important to his father than he is. Your son will begin to resent him for this. Your husband is being selfish and acting childish.", "NTA. I know vets that served 20 years and don't make their service their whole personality. Kids birthday comes before a thank you for his service. That's why he served. Peace and quiet.", "NTA\n\nDoes your husband also celebrate the US Army \"birthday\" on June 4? It sounds like his self-image may be overly invested in being a veteran because he hasn't done much since. He needs to move on with his life. He should be thanked and celebrated for his service, but he needs to develop a life beyond that. Your son's actual birthday should be more important.\n\nI'm a Desert Storm veteran. Memorial Day is depressing for me because that's when memories of lost friends are strongest. Your husband may have irrationally strong feelings about Veterans Day for reasons of his own. You should ask if he's able to explain why Veterans Day is so important to him.\n\nHowever, as other folks have pointed out, it's a minor Federal holiday. Banks might close, but most businesses don't. And many veterans don't celebrate it at all.

It just takes some intention on both your parts to make it happen. It\u2019ll be worth it in the end. You\u2019re going to blink and that tiny brand new baby is going to be moving out of your house.

He is a veteran of the US army and values his military service as a very important part of himself and his history. He served for eight years before he was honorably discharged. \n\nI gave birth to our son M nearly two months ago, on November 11th. It's a long way away from his next birthday, but we've still been discussing the logistics of how we're going to handle future holidays now that we have a baby. My husband is very particular about those kinds of things, and he really likes having an idea of how things will go a long time in advance. \n\nIt finally came up that he had been born on Veterans Day, which my husband obviously knew but I don't know if it sank in at the time. I told him that I intended to celebrate our son's birthday on November 11th, and we could have our Veterans Day dinner the day after. My husband was angry, and said that it's unreasonable to move a whole holiday when the whole US is celebrating on that day, and that we could celebrate M's birthday the day prior or the next day. \n\nWe still haven't come to an agreement. He thinks I'm an asshole for disrespecting his military service when the baby won't know his birthday is being celebrated a day later, but I think our son's birthday is much more important.

Sad but true fact.\n\nProbably worth it to move the party to a weekend when it doesn\u2019t fall on one by default, when you get to the school years.
