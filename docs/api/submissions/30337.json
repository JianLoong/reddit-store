{"id": 30337, "submission_id": "17o0yf0", "title": "AITA for going back on an offer to treat my girlfriend and her sister to dinner", "selftext": "My (29M) girlfriend's (27F) sister (29F) was passing through the city recently and we had made plans to go out to dinner together. This was the first time I was meeting her and also her first time in the city so I basically told her she could pick where she wanted to eat and I would treat all of us. However it wasn't until we were just about to leave that I found out the place she had made a reservation actually averaged almost $1000 per person. I thought the most expensive places in our area were $100 per person or a couple hundred but this seemed like way too much to spend on one dinner, so I said no. It was too late already to get another high-end reservation so we ended up just going to a \"normal\" restaurant that GF and I have been to before and still had what I thought was a great dinner but that definitely made the night a little awkward.\n\nAfter her sister left my GF started acting really distant, and when I tried to talk to her about it she accused me of being stingy and embarrassing her, and said her sister had really wanted to go to that restaurant and was really disappointed we didn't get to go. She said paying $1000 for dinner on my salary was like a normal person paying $100 on a special occasion, which is true, I am lucky to work a tech job where I am paid in the low-to-mid 6 figures. However my family was solid middle class growing up and to me $3000 is a lot of money and it seems crazy to spend that much on one meal, even if in theory I could afford it. I have noticed in our relationship that me and GF have very different understandings of money as her family did not have money growing up, so sometimes she will spend an extra hours and hours of time just to save little money, for example transferring buses several times to get to the airport instead of just getting a $20 taxi and getting there 2.5 hours faster. But other times she will have a little bit of money and spend it all in one go instead of saving it.\n\nI have tried to help her become more financially literate and she has helped me recognize different ways I have been privileged growing up without realizing it. However I am wondering if I should have just sucked it up and forked over the $3000, AITA for ruining our night and making a terrible first impression?\n\nEDIT: Please don't suggest my GF is somehow a \"gold digger\", it was not her who chose the restaurant. She doesn't even let me pay for dinner unless she gets it next time, and is fastidious about keeping a spreadsheet of our expenses as early in our relationship I would try to pay for more than my share. It was never that important to me that our expenses be exactly 50/50, I think the point of having money is to be able to spend it to make the lives of those you care about easier", "created_utc": 1699147355, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17o0yf0/aita_for_going_back_on_an_offer_to_treat_my/", "score": 200, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She may not be a gold digger but her sister sure was. And she was OKAY WITH IT because you make more money and you were paying for it. For someone that would spend hours transferring buses to save less than 20$ that\u2019s really weird. If she had invited HER OWN SISTER out to eat I\u2019m sure as shit she wouldn\u2019t have even considered that place, or been embarrassed that she couldn\u2019t pay for it. She can\u2019t pick and choose when to be financially savvy, honestly 1000$ for dinner per person is to much for almost anyone. I\u2019ll be honest I think you\u2019re being a bit foolish, and will probably be taken advantage of in the future if you cave or apologize about this. If anything your girlfriend should be apologizing to you for her sisters gross attempt at mooching off of you, and the fact that she didn\u2019t is concerning. Growing up poor or just not as financially privileged usually leaves one with the habits you described, ie transferring buses for hours to save $20, and ordering cheap menu items with no drinks or appetizers. If you invite someone out to dinner and they take this opportunity to order lobster, steak, multiple drinks, etc or SUGGEST A 1k PER PERSON RESTAURANT was 100% taking advantage of you. If you\u2019re planing a future with her maybe try harder to get her to be more financially literate, doing stupid stuff like this is how you end up living outside your means, with fancy cars and houses but up to your eyeballs in debt trying to keep up appearances. Don\u2019t be a fool.", "So you said fancier, and she went \"let's get this sucker to take me to the most expensive place I can possibly find\".  \nSTA and sorry but so is your girlfriend.", "NTA, it sounds like you are in what is called an inter-class relationship. In my experience as someone who has also ridden this line such relationships almost never end up working out. Before I am accused of being an elitist I want to emphasize I am not saying one class is better than another, rather your experiences, values and especially attitudes towards money are just incompatible.\n\nIt sounds like your GF has had early life experience of poverty. People who grew up poor tend to have behaviors such as spending a lot of time to save a small amount of money, or living hand-to-mouth (i.e., not thinking long-term) or really being paranoid about contributing their share, all of which I am seeing in your comments. Really stressing over small promises you might have made to other people and keeping them even at great inconvenience to yourself is a common response to life insecurity. At the same time poor people are also very community-oriented and value generosity a lot, which means if someone asks you for help you give them what you have, even if you're not in a great position yourself (because no one ever is) and helping them complicates your own situation. The flip side to this is, if one person has a little success, they rain it on their \"village\" rather than hoarding it for themselves.\n\nOn the other hand it sounds like you grew up middle class and are now professional upper class. People with your upbringing value time more than money, and exercising discipline in the short term for long-term gains is seen as virtuous. Because you are used to being secure in your basic necessities, you are more understanding and flexible when plans change, even if it means you have to \"flake\". People from your background are on some level more individualistic--this is not to say you are not also community-oriented or generous, but it is just the strategy that gets passed down because it allows wealth to survive rather than dissipate. If someone asks for your help, you will probably think about how much you can give them without creating hardship for yourself. Likewise, when you have a windfall, you are likely to share some portion of it with those close to you but reserve most of it for your own future uses (see the second sentence).\n\nI think this explains a lot about this situation and your relationship. You'd like to be spending more on experiences and say you don't care if you spend more, but the inevitable result will be your girlfriend feels pressured to match your level of spending, which based on what you've said sounds like she can't. So you are probably feeling constrained by her lifestyle. You are probably also not used to how freely she gives away money given how hard she works to save it. And because you have had success, she probably expects you to rain it down on your \"village\" rather than buying your S&P 500 ETFs or whatever--if it was her with your job she would probably happily treat her siblings and yours to a $1000 dinner she has no expectation that it will last, so better to have had the success and enjoyed it, than to have had it and been stingy with it, and inevitably lose it anyway to something banal like having to give it to your aunt/grandmother/neighbor for a repair/medical bill/wedding. But I also consider these signs that your upbringings are just too different and you assign very different weights to things we all agree are good like community, frugality, generosity, etc--which means it will probably not work out", "There are restaurants that cost $1k per person????\n\nGood grief, I hope you get massages and pedicures while someone is hand feeding you your dinner served on solid gold china, at the very least.", "Nta.

She said paying $1000 for dinner on my salary was like a normal person paying $100 on a special occasion, which is true, I am lucky to work a tech job where I am paid in the low-to-mid 6 figures. However my family was solid middle class growing up and to me $3000 is a lot of money and it seems crazy to spend that much on one meal, even if in theory I could afford it.

However, it's crucial that such desires are balanced with financial sensibility and open communication about spending limits especially when it involves such a significant amount of money. It's generous enough that you offered to treat them to dinner, and it's unfortunate that the cost was not discussed beforehand. It's understandable that the cost of the restaurant was a surprise to you. \n\nGiven the differences in your and your girlfriend's perspectives on money, it might be beneficial for both of you to consult with a financial professional.

However I have noticed that my GF and her sister were brought up with different values. For example, if someone in her family needs money, she will always give them something even if she doesn't have much to give. And vice versa. How I grew up both giving and receiving a \"handout\" were deeply frowned upon. To be fair I did explicitly say to pick somewhere fancier, and reflecting on the people I grew up with I definitely knew people who were not wealthy by any means but would spend the same fraction of their income on a special occasion dinner, especially when treating loved ones, without hesitation.

So how did you get out of that situation?", "Thanks. I don't find the relationship transactional, I should clarify a few things: in the airport scenario we were going together, she wanted to take several buses so we would both save money, I was the one who suggested getting a taxi. When I mentioned when she gets some money she will spend it, it is money she earned herself. \n\nI specifically told her to have her sister pick somewhere nicer than she would go herself so it was not a matter of impressing her, I think **I** was the one who wanted to impress her to make a good first impression haha", "Yeah and I\u2019m sure your biggest fear is some gold digger taking all your Monopoly money right?", "In fact quite the opposite--my GF keeps very careful track of how much we are both spending to make sure she is contributing the same amount that I am, we even have a spreadsheet for it.

But at the same time I don't want to pressure her to spend more than she is comfortable with, or feel she is \"indebted\" to me somehow", "I think a big part of why my GF was angry upon reflection is that I broke my word. I have learned over the course of our relationship that keeping your word is sacred to her, and she will really bend over backwards to keep even a tiny promise that honestly I might have forgotten about, like being home at a certain time so we can cook together (e.g. if something comes up at work, she will really stress herself to still make it by the time she said, even if it means making a sacrifice). We have talked about this in the past and I learned staying true to your word was very important in her upbringing as life in her community could be very unpredictable without guarantees of things that I was lucky to take for granted, so one of the few sources of predictability was that if someone you trusted said they were going to do something, they would do it", "I don't have that impression at all. We have been together for over a year now and she has never asked me for anything, she doesn't even let me pay for dinner unless she gets it next time, and keeps a meticulous spreadsheet of our expenses to make sure we are each putting in 50%. I honestly don't care if I am paying for more than my share for dinners and ubers and things, I don't really have any other expenses and to me this is exactly the point of having a high income if I can spend it to make the lives of people I care about easier.\n\nTo be fair she also seemed surprised by the price tag of the restaurant and I would find it extremely out of character for her when normally she is very careful and specifically asks that I not give her expensive gifts.

At that point those are just numbers, I could not imagine what it would mean to spend a couple months' worth of groceries or more money than I ever had in my account at once on one meal, or how good that meal must be.

Sister\u2019s do that.\n\nIf I told someone I would treat them to lunch and they chose a restaurant in Italy, then I\u2019d have every right to go back on my promise and they couldn\u2019t be \u201cmad\u201d at me for it. Or try and bring up some type of honor code; your word and the terms ended up different then what you thought you were agreeing to. \n\nAlso, you did fulfill your promise! You treated everyone to dinner, no? So what is she on about?", "The sister is 29 and that's old enough to know you don't exploit a nice offer like she did - she's a gold digger/user.  Your gf should have checked her sister, not you. Now they both know not to push it.", "People keep suggesting it because this is Reddit and 85% of people on this site are incel idiots who have never touched a women let alone been in a relationship.", "You still kept your promise though, you treated them both to dinner\u2026just at a price point that most would find reasonable.", "But my problem she let his sister used you like that where is the respect she let his own boyfriend to get used like that from her own sister the fact she knew the reason why you went to a cheaper restaurant she didn\u2019t like it that it was a embarrassment moment for her what about your respect you work hard for your money", ">It was not my GF who chose the restaurant.   \n>  \n>accused me of being stingy and embarrassing her  \n>  \n>so sometimes she will spend an extra hours and hours of time just to save little money\n\nINFO: How could not spending $3000 on 1 meal for 3 people embarrass her? How is it stingy?  Why does she think it is okay to spend $3000 of your money without asking?  How often does she try to spend thousands of your dollars without asking?  Does she always try to make you feel guilty for saying no to spending your money like it is nothing (stingy for saying no??)  Why didn't she tell her sister no and that you are not an ATM?  Why the guilt trip because you did say no?  Why does she save her money but spend yours?  Why does her sister also think you are an ATM?  \n\n\"she has helped me recognize different ways I have been privileged growing up without realizing it. \"\n\nIs this one of the ways she manipulates you into not embarrassing her by being an ATM????\n\nDUDE - RUN!!! Gold Digger... stop being an ATM.", "Yeah but your GF should\u2019ve set a boundary with her sister before she suggested it. As sisters they likely discussed it before telling you, and that your GF didn\u2019t gawk herself and ask her sister to be more reasonable is a red flag.\n\nOne day that might be shared money, and OP your wife wouldn\u2019t spent it without batting an eye.", "Even if your girlfriend isn\u2019t the one who picked the restaurant, the fact that she thinks that $3000 is a normal amount for you to spend at your income level is extremely concerning. Even if you could afford it, being comfortable with someone else dropping that amount of money is a big red flag. I am also someone who grew up in a modest family and takes promises very seriously - if my sister had asked for a $3000 dinner I would be much more upset with her for that request than at my partner for not following through. Her priorities are not straight and I would be a lot more cautious moving forward in this relationship if I were you. I also make around the same amount as you and if this happened to me I would definitely have a serious talk with my partner. \n\nNTA", "You are too sweet. Your girlfriend and her sister set this up together. I would be embarrassed to expect anyone to pay for such an extravagant meal for me or my family members. Your girl is a gold digger, she might have planned this meal as her swan song or just testing her abilities to see how much she could get. Get out while you can. You don't need someone that will be a constant drain on you and your finances.", "Even if OP were earning millions, it\u2019s still gauche AF. I know a good number of millionaires (I\u2019m related to several and have a few friends who are trust fund kids) and I have never, ever asked them to take me out for a meal that was $1k each. Would never even cross my mind. That\u2019s insane. \n\nNTA, OP. Not sure what your girlfriend\u2019s sister was playing at here, but she needs to get a grip. You keep saying your girlfriend isn\u2019t normally a gold digger, but she sure is ready to spend your money when she feels the need. Might want to keep an eye on that.", "This is the issue for me. He didn\u2019t pick it. You don\u2019t propose such an extravagance on someone else\u2019s dime. Ever.", "My husband and I recently spent $2000.00 on a dinner for the two of us. It was our 29th anniversary, however, and we decided on the restaurant together. We can afford it, but we\u2019re honestly still freaked out we spent that much! But, boy, it was GOOD. NTA, sis and gf are obnoxious about this", "\\^ This. I think OP has a severe case of rose-tinted glasses", "He said he thought the most expensive places in their area were $100/person, so I doubt it\u2019s New York.", "But seriously who would think someone they invited to dinner would rudely choose the most expensive place they could find", "He told his girlfriend to have her pick a place, which then the girlfriend would presumably make reservations for.", "I think they're confusing the girlfriend's choices for the sister's, because this is reddit and reading comprehension is hard.\n\nThat being said, the family are DEFINITELY users and will take every opportunity to drag OP down by playing on his gf's guilt and inability to set boundaries. She needs to get a spine. Now.", "I\u2019m beginning to think she wanted to impress her sister with how good her life turned out. She\u2019s just mad OP spoiled her plans.", "You\u2019re not wrong, but \u201cpick a restaurant, and make sure it\u2019s fancy - I\u2019m paying\u201d is\u2026 also \u201cgauche\u201d (\ud83d\ude44). And then taking it back? Yikes. Sure sister made herself way too comfortable, but I don\u2019t blame the girlfriend for being annoyed with OP. Now everyone is uncomfortable.\n\nNever write a blank check if you don\u2019t want it cashed.", "This is also a huge reach. All gf said was that her sister was disappointed that they didn\u2019t get to go to the fancier restaurant. We have no evidence of attempted manipulation or a lack of spine in gf. \n\nFor all we know, sister made a good-faith effort to meet OP\u2019s \u201cpick somewhere fancier\u201d request, got hyped for an experience she *thought* was within his budget, and was then bummed out and a little embarrassed when her choice was shot down.", "So you're saying, if your parents offered to buy you a car for your 18th birthday, you would have asked for a $3,000,000 Koenigsegg? And then got mad when they didn't buy it cause \"don't write checks you can't cash\"?", "But he didn\u2019t say make it fancy. He said pick a place. And it was the gf that picked it, it was the sister. \n\nSo sure you can blame him (you\u2019d be wrong, but, you can), but then you should also be side eyeing the sister, who had the audacity to expect someone she just met to drop a grand on her.", "The post also says his gf called him stingy and that he embarrassed her. Also that it shouldn't be a big deal on his salary, which he clearly disagrees with. I don't think it's that surprising that people think his gf is a gold digger with that attitude while not even offering to pay 1/3-1/2 of what was likely to be a $3000 meal that *her* sister picked. The sister could've picked a place that was $200-300 a person and still had a high end meal.\n\nNTA", "If the sister thought a restaurant the cost $1,000/plat was within OP\u2019s budget, the she presumably has a pretty good idea about how much OP makes \u2014 because if she thought he was someone who makes $40K annually, she wouldn\u2019t have take \u201cpick somewhere fancier\u201d to mean \u201cpick a restaurant where one meal will be close to 10% of my income for the year\u201d. And, maybe it\u2019s just me, but I can\u2019t think of a good reason for why OP\u2019s girlfriend\u2019s sister would know how much money OP makes unless his girlfriend was telling the, all about it which is kinda a red flag", "He made a direct request that the sister pick a \u201cfancy\u201d (his words) place and made sure to remind everyone he is paying. That\u2019s already an embarrassing enough move. The resentment the GF has is over first impressions and starting things off on the right foot.\n\nI am really confused by your hypothetical situation which has no parallels to draw other than spending money", "I mean you\u2019re replying to a chain in which OP acknowledges he \u201cexplicitly\u201d requested the sister pick something \u201cfancier\u201d\u2026\n\nAnd where did I give the sister a pass? I literally agreed with the poster I\u2019m responding to in the first sentence.", "If I wasn't told to pick a fancy place, I'd pick Chili's price range. I think he was just letting her know she could stretch that a bit."]}
