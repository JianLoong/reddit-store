So I moved into a townhouse in December with my kids. My immediate neighbor and I have always been friendly, she baked me cookies when I first moved in. I had to set some boundaries when just a few weeks after moving in she asked me if I could watch her two year old so she could run to the grocery store. I didn\u2019t mind that, but she just kept asking me to watch them for her to do tasks and I didn\u2019t want to be responsible for essentially a strangers child. When I did set my boundaries she got very upset saying that Im home all day while my boyfriend works so its not like I wouldnt be doing the same thing. I felt uncomfortable after that so I stopped speaking to her. \n\nShe has a teenage daughter who Ive seen sneaking out through the backyard we share a few times on the weekends but I mind my business and honestly couldnt care less. Im 19 myself so I remember sneaking out. Her daughter has also told me that her mom works a lot during the evening and nights and she also has to work a fast food job to pay the bills so her mother leaves her toddler in the hands of her six and eight year old to take care of during those hours. I was so shocked and felt like reporting it to CPS but my boyfriend said not to and that he was raised in the system of our city and it sucks. Ever since I always keep an ear out and even feel compelled to knock on their door some nights with food to make sure theyre ok and have set up cameras outside in case anything happens theres something recording. The eight year old is very mature and they all sleep in one room shes told me but its a sad situation. \n\n\nLast night my neighbor knocked on my door to ask me if I\u2019ve ever seen her teen daughter sneak out since another neighbor said they saw her jumping the fence to the backyard and she knows I spend a lot of time on the deck out there. I said no and she said to keep an eye out and let her know and I said its not my responsibility to do that. She laughs and says but I think its my responsibility to bring her kids food and I snapped back and said thats because shes a shitty mother and to be a better mom and that she should be more concerned that she has her child working a job so they can pay rent than if she sneaks out and to stop having kids and to stop asking me questions. She called me a bitch and said to not bring her kids fast food and that shes a better mom than me that stays home all day with a toddler. That she works 80 hours a week to take care of her kids with no help and is only 30 and Im an entitled bitch to refuse to watch her toddler but claim to care about their wellbeing. Shes now telling neighbors that I \u201ccussed her out\u201d and ruining my reputation.

I think this family has much bigger issues than whether or not the oldest daughter is sneaking out at night. I know your boyfriend doesn't want to put young kids into the system, but if she's leaving a seven and eight year old alone with a toddler for multiple hours, and the oldest isn't at home to keep an eye on them, they could get themselves into danger. You might need to make that call if something doesn't change.\n\nNTA.", "Your neighbors, if they have been paying attention, know what kind of a person she is and how she runs her family. I am sure your neighbors take her badmouthing you with a big old grain of salt.\n\nNTA for keeping quiet about her legally adult daughter hopping the fence out back. Not your problem-not your business. \n\nAbout feeding the little kids- Obviously you don\u2019t want them to go hungry. And she could have *thanked* you for feeding them. Talk about biting the hand\u2026\n\nNTA And if you see the kids being hungry, fuck it, I would report her. It will take a lot for them to take the kids away. Maybe the authorities will even get her some assistance.", "NTA.  She is definitely in a tough situation, but her kids are not your responsibility.  \n\nCalling CPS yourself would be a difficult choice, but CPS would DEFINITELY like to know about the situation of an 8 year old being the \u201cresponsible\u201d one left in charge of the other kids.  Child care is expensive and she probably feels as if she has no choice, but she is failing in that aspect of motherhood.", "NTA.  i think people are smart enough to make their judgements based on reality and what they know of you both rather than this one rumour she is spreading.  she put you in a difficult position, she shouldn't have even asked.  but everyone has a different idea of closeness, so maybe she thought you two were closer than you are.\n\ni digress, for both your sakes, i hope you will at least mend fences.  it sucks being neighbours with an enemy.   even if you were right, i'd apologize and try to at least be cordial again.", "NTA - this mom sounds like a nightmare to live next  to, especially having to worry for her children all the time! She has some nerve for sure, and you're kind to worry about them. The absolute gall I'm trying to make you responsible for her children because you're home in the daytime! Wow!! She needs to manage her own life and leave you alone. Whatever help you give her you certainly don't owe her more just because she thinks you do. and you definitely don't owe her policing her teenage daughter.  In fact you owe her exactly nothing. FWIW, I don't think you would be off base calling child protective services but I don't know where you live - I'm in a state that houses foster  kids in office buildings so I certainly get your boyfriend's perspective.", "NTA. Her kids are her responsibility, not yours. I get it that she is in a hard situation, but she has overstepped your reasonable boundaries", "NTA. Boundaries. Yes you could have lied to her but she would eventually have another ask, and another.\n\nYour neighbours probably already know about this woman's parenting, and most will probably understand the real reason.", "Barely NTA... its OK that you set the boundary to not spy on her behalf.  She's already displayed she can't handle the word \"no\" when someone is unable/unwilling to take  responsibility for her kids, but you send mixed signals by checking in.", "NTA. She needs to find an actual baby sitter. She also needs to talk to her oldest daughter about getting a night job so she can stay home with the kids, and in return maybe give her more freedom so she could go out without having to tiptoe around it. She's an asshole for just assuming you have the time and capability to watch a toddler just because you're at home. You could also tell her that you have an online job where you work at home to try and get her off your ass at least a little bit. And when it comes to cps, I get where your boyfriend is coming from, but sometimes it's best to get them out of that situation. CPS might not even take the kids, and even if they do, they'll give the mom a chance to get her shit together, because for them, rehabilitation is easier and better for the kids in the long run. Just try and hang in there, it can be difficult having a neighbor that likes to twist things in their favor.", "YTA \n\nThis was a stupid thing to pick a fight over. The whole thing could have been avoided by saying, \"Nope, haven't seen a thing!\" and moving on with you day.", "NTA I'm always wary of the sweet neighbour with the baked goods and who immediately offers a little favour and then starts demanding pretty constant child care, lifts and other big asks. They are not kind or nice, they are just baiting a hook to reel you in. It is not your job to watch her toddler. It doesn't make you entitled because you don't want to get involved. If you are not careful everything will be palmed off on you.", "Holy shit; yes. Obviously, YTA here. Your neighbor, who you've always had a kind relationship with and who hasn't done anything wrong to you, asks you to let her know if you see her daughter sneaking out (and, spoiler, her teenage daughter isn't sneaking out to work a job, but that's besides the point). You could have said \"Okay.\" You could have said \"I don't feel comfortable doing that.\" You could have just continued to lie and said \"Sure,\" but not followed through. Instead, you antagonized her by saying it wasn't your responsibility, and when she gave you an equally sassy retort, *you called her shitty mother and told her to be a better mom.*\n\nYou went nuclear on this single mother working multiple jobs, because she dared ask you if you'd noticed her daughter sneaking out at night. Yeah, you're absolutely the AH here.", "ESH\n\nYTA for snapping at her, yes. You could make things a lot worse for her kids. \n\nYou've inserted yourself into their lives, so you've taken on responsibility. Either drop it all or go Gung ho, but don't do this wishy washy bullshit. \n\nIf you're that concerned for their safety that you've installed security cameras and you're dropping food off, you need to report it to CPS.

I know the system sucks and it won't be very nice for them if they end up there. But I'd argue its better than something terrible happening and 1 of the kids dying.

It's all kinds of wrong I really hope you report this", "She never said the teenagers age OP said they are 19", "Calling CPS should only be done for severe neglect or physical abuse.

Fair I wouldn\u2019t \u201crat\u201d out the older kid either but I\u2019m not going to claim boundaries when I\u2019m breaking them myself. ESH.

Not being properly supervised and kept safe ***is*** child neglect. I get that she's a single mom to 4 kids but that is not ok. So many things could go wrong that an 8 and 6 year old would not know how to deal with.", "It\u2019s not but sadly it\u2019s a reality for many. When you grow up in a house like this, one tends to mature fast. I understand the instinct but the system is broken. Foster homes and group homes can be traumatizing. Are there good foster parents out there? Yes but the ones who do it for a check and/or to have access to children is sadly higher than you think. And many group homes (boys will be sent there even when they are on the younger side) are dangerous and a step below juvenile detention. Maybe instead of judging she could pitch in a help for a reasonable fee.\n\nEdit: don\u2019t forget the siblings will also most likely be separated.", "Nope. That would lead to the mom wanting to drop the kids off all the time to run errands like before. If the mom can afford a reasonable fee, she should talk to other parents or see if a local teenager or adults would like to sit with them at night.", "I\u2019m not saying she has to help. But this strikes me like those judgmental Christians who love to judge but don\u2019t actually want to give a helping hand bc of said judgement. She absolutely doesn\u2019t owe this woman anything but she\u2019ll be throwing those kids life into chaos if she calls CPS.\n\nEdit: it also bugs me that she seems more concerned about her reputation. And if that\u2019s the case she shouldn\u2019t call CPS bc y\u2019all need to ask yourselves why none of the other neighbors have at this point. They will judge her for going too far. For whatever reason they support this single mother.", "If she is indeed a sucky neighbor, the other neighbors will find out without the single mom having to say a word. \n\nI'm mostly concerned about small children being left alone to care for a toddler.", "I\u2019m with you, not arguing just more saying this is nuanced bc I bet all the neighbors know what\u2019s going on. So I wonder why they haven\u2019t felt CPS is necessary. Maybe this woman has a really hard luck story and they know she\u2019s doing the best she can. That\u2019s all I\u2019m saying.", "ESH. The mom for obv reasons, but I don\u2019t think you are helping here. At all. If you are concerned that they don\u2019t have enough to eat, then you have grounds to involve social services. Giving someone else\u2019s kids food without permission isn\u2019t super cool, and choosing fast food is worse.\n\nThe cameras always recording in the backyard is also pretty creepy. \n\nWhen you get a bit more life (and parenting!) experience I think you\u2019ll find that calling out someone as a bad parent is a waste of time. What was the point of that whole exchange? To make the mom feel bad? That\u2019s an AH thing to do, esp since it sounds like she lives in grinding poverty. If your motivation was to help the kids - making her feel defensive about what she needs to do to survive isn\u2019t going to change things. Also, what do you think she ought to do differently? She already tried to get your assistance and you \u201cset a boundary\u201d. You are not entitled to simultaneously criticize and refuse to help. If it\u2019s not your problem, you should mind your own business.", "ESH. You were good up to the point where you said it's not your responsibility to keep an eye on the teenager. Then with the shitty mother and stop having kids remarks, you became TA. It's not a good situation, but poor people don't have a lot of choices. Your BF's right that the kids would be worse off in the system.\n\nI think you were right to set the boundary of not being her free on-call babysitter, and you're certainly not an entitled bitch for that.", "NTA, that's an actual yikes\n\nEdit: just saw the top comment also said yikes, everyone is in sync", "She called you a bitch but is telling neighbors you cussed her out for saying she was a shitty mom? And because you won't watch her kid, she doesn't want you to feed them? Where is the logic in any of this? Do your neighbors know that she leaves the little kids home with no childcare? Or does she leave that part out? Would be interesting to hear everything the neighbors have been told about her situation.", "NTA. Don't worry, the rest of the neighbors know what's going on over there, and won't take her word for anything about you.\n\nIt is not safe for the three youngest children to stay home without adults supervision for hours on end. Despite what your boyfriend says, I think you should call children's services, IF you do that, be prepared for the mom to accuse you (and probably the rest of the building) of reporting her and she could cause you trouble. You should make sure you have cameras at your front door, where you park your car, etc.", "If she has a fast food job, she\u2019s probably at least 15."]}
