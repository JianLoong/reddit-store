She has her rights too.", "NTA, but you have to understand that it could lessen your intimacy. Particularly if you wind up having bad beard hygiene. Food, sweat, dirt, all get trapped in there and some guys are really bad at maintaining it because they feel it's just like washing your face. Having a luscious beard takes work. A lot of work. And oils. And she might just find it repulsive to have hair pressed against her face to give you a kiss. Beard hair can often feel a lot like pubic hair (depending on the hair growth), and that's 'gross' for some people. Then again, some women love men with big full beards, so if you grow a beard, you might just wind up needing to find a new wife if she finds it unattractive. Don't get all weird if she doesn't like kissing you or being intimate. She might just not be into it. Don't pressure her. But you have to figure out what you want more. THIS wife or a beard.", "NTA. Your face your choice of course. But do keep it well groomed? Is it neat? Do you keep it shaped up? Well oiled? Or are you wolfing it and going for the more rustic look? I\u2019m definitely on your side but to play devils advocate maybe it\u2019s how the beard looks not how it looks on you per say", "I married a beardless man. He now has a beard. I don\u2019t like it. It makes him look old and I believe it\u2019s unhygienic. I feel if I made such a dramatic change in my facial appearance (eg shaved my head) my partner would be within his rights to object. Ultimately though, it\u2019s up to the individual to decide on how they present themselves. What you can\u2019t control though is how your partner responds. If they no longer find you attractive, are you prepared to give up that part of your life? NTA, but maybe have a think.", "NTA. My ex husband & I were together 16 years, I liked him with a beard, and thought he looked a lot better than without. But once It started getting longer, he would drop food in it and not notice. The man would spend hours brushing it, oiling it, styling it, etc, but he\u2019d still drop food in it, or get food/drinks in the mustache part, and it would just be disgusting. It finally got to the point where I told him to cut it back to just a normal short beard. He refused, so one night I sent him to town to grab something from the store for me right after I\u2019d made spaghetti\u2026 didn\u2019t tell him he had bits of meat sauce in his beard. He come right home and shaved it back immediately.   Grow your beard. Just keep it neat and foodless. Maybe it makes me an AH, but I\u2019d have divorced him over it shortly if he hadn\u2019t have shaved.", "NTA\n\nOh wow.  So, my husband has always worn a beard.  \n\nFor a while before we got together he was keeping it longer.  But by the time we got together he was keeping it shorter.  But the style he kept with it at that time was a little unusual.  No mustache, but kind of a big square down his neck?  So he'd shave the sides near the sideburns, and trim up the bottom at the neck, leaving just this largeish square.  I find him very attractive regardless but I wasn't a huge fan of this style specifically.\n\nOne day I suggested he try trimming it up to more of a goatee, narrower and without going down the neck.  Did mention that I like goatees.  He said he'd give it a shot and see what he thought.  He turned out to like it, so he's kept it that way ever since.  No mustache, just the goatee, sometimes a little tighter, sometimes with a bit more depth toward the neck.  Often lets the stubble grow out.\n\nI suggested.  Without insulting.  And he had every right to say no.  If he'd refused, I'd have accepted that.  Because it's his beard.  It's his choice.  He gave it a shot because ultimately he was willing to do so.  He kept it because he likes it.  The fact that I like it is a bonus, not the point.\n\nThat's not the situation you have here.  She's being pushy and insulting.  Of course you finally lost patience with it.\n\nIt is not okay that she's being insulting about this.  \"You look disgusting,\" seriously?  That's no way to speak to one's partner.  You deserve better than that.", "I kind of get her point. I find mustaches disgusting. Couldn\u2019t even kiss someone with one. But also it\u2019s your body and you can decorate it as you wish.", "NTA because it's your face. But I have a feeling if she stopped shaving her legs and armpits it would be a different story.", "NTA\nYour face your choice\n\nDoes your wife allow you a say over her haircut,  her clothing choices,  her makeup,  her weight??\n\nNope, same goes for her.", "NTA you're allowed to grow hair wherever you want.

So much bacteria from stray food and drink.", "NTA but expect it to take a toll on your marriage if you grow it out.

It's your face.", "NTA. It's your body, and I'm sure she'd tell you to f\\*ck off if you demanded she keep her legs shaved baby-smooth or you'll think she's disgusting.", "This one depends.

YTA if you want her to be attached to you. \nNTA if you dgaf about her wanting to let you stick parts of your body in hers", "The way I look at it is my wife is the one who has to look at me far more than I ever look in a mirror.  It's okay to have opinions about our spouses hair upkeep, I know I do with my wife and try not to mention when she's lazy.  She usually makes a remark after the second day of me not shaving", "ESH. She can give her opinion but at the end of the day it\u2019s your decision. However\u2026I would never do something to my body that my husband hated bc\u2026he has to look at me. Lol.

But I have told my husband that facial hair, at any length, causes my skin to break out when I get too close.  So he can go ahead and have facial hair, but I won\u2019t be kissing him while he has it.  My husband hasn\u2019t had facial hair for 27 years, because he likes kissing me.

Gotta keep your composure about something this small tbh", "I know I\u2019ll be with the minority but I kinda would say ESH. She may not be attracted to you with a beard and she has expressed that.

Short of an actual hygiene issue OP it\u2019s just a goddamn beard. Experiment with it, have fun grooming it, shave it off if you change your mind. Blowing up at your wife isn\u2019t great but if I called my girl\u2019s face *disgusting* because of how she chose to groom it I\u2019d expect a few harsh words too.\n\nFunny how bodily autonomy and the right to look  how you want doesn\u2019t extend to men.

My wife feels as though I should want her to like my appearance but it has now gotten to a point that I don't really care and want to do this for myself. This is why I'm asking if I'm an a******.", "The problem with what your wife's saying isn't her objection to you growing out your beard. She has as much right to not like changes you make to your body as you have the right to do to it what you want. \n\nThe issue is that she's being disrespectful as hell. You're NTA. But she definitely is. \n\nYou don't call your spouse disgusting to their face unless they are engaging in nasty activities such as shooting loads of semen in a laundry room or growing mold spores on Iranian yogurt. Growing a beard isn't disgusting and most men manage to keep their beards clean. \\[I myself have a goatee and my wife loves it; she wishes that I grew out both my beard and hair the way her dad has since the 1970s, but that's not for me for now.\\]\n\nShe can object to you growing a beard. But she has no right to be an asshole about it. You are the man she loves, and when you love someone, you criticize with love, not denigrate or insult them. I dare say that you need to sit her down during a quiet moment, express to her how her comments are insulting, hurtful and unloving, and that you will no longer tolerate her insults. One more of these and she will have hell to pay!\n\nYou deserve respect, even if you don't deserve unqualified support for changes to your body. There's a way that your wife can not show support without being downright rude, insulting, cruel, crude and immature.

It applies to you as well as to her.", "WTF are these comments??? NTA at all! Your wife is a super asshole though. These comments would be flipping the fuck out if it was a husband calling a wife disgusting for cutting her hair, not shaving her legs, or wearing/not wearing make up.

Grow it or don't, that's 100% your call, unless you get to tell her what to do with her hair.  Mind you, she may choose not to be close with your face when you do, but that's still your call.

Because you are called in marriage to be better than that. You *should* care about her preferences. What makes her comfortable. You should be willing to sacrifice things that she cares about for her comfort, and she should reciprocate that back towards you. That's a healthy marriage--where when spouses tell each other something that really bothers them, they compromise and find a middle ground.\n\nThis mindset of \"my wife can f off\" is gross.

She had been married to her husband for many years and her husband had never grown a beard because she told him right off the bat, \"You can choose whether or not you want to grow a beard and I can choose whether or not I want to kiss you.\"", "Also, going off of this, women can get infections on their face if they kiss a guy with a long, unclean beard", "I dated a guy who used to say he wanted to grow a beard like the guys from Duck Dynasty. Our joke was that, as soon as he made that kind of money, he could grow whatever type of facial hair he wanted.", "Since being with her it's never gotten past the length of a quarter of an inch so I haven't had a need to oil it or anything like that but I do keep it shaped up when it gets to that length.", "I actually have no strong feelings on those things. We have three children and are very busy and she frequently skips those places. Sometimes for a week to a couple of weeks. I love everything about the woman I married no matter what she has growing under her arms or on her legs.", "My point exactly!", "Na, they don't have to be. My relatives lived with me for a couple years during the pandemic because they lost their housing, the husband/father combed and cleaned his beard after eating. I never saw anything in it at all. I think you just have to put it the few minutes of making sure that it's clean.", "No more bacteria than every other surface in and on your body", "A mental hit for her? Try being called disgusting by your spouse. \n\nIf this was a woman who didn't want to shave her body hair or wear makeup, everyone would be up in arms that it's her body and absolutely pissed about her spouse calling her disgusting.", "I normally bend to her will and shave it. I would just like to grow it out once", "I just know you'd be flipping on op if he was talking about how he hates his wife body hair and how gross it is.", "I think you're missing the point that's it's not just we there she likes it or not it's the insults and disrespect that have built up for years. Imagine Everytime you cut your hair the way you like your SO said you were disgusting to your face.", "Since she is not attracted to it because it can very well be unhygienic, no one should wonder about why she might wave goodbye. They might just be incompatible.\nBoth of them sound immature though, and I think that the way things were expressed is not ideal at all. Its a ESH from me.", "Ok, fair enough, HOWEVER don't be surprised if she doesn't want to kiss you or it affects your sex life... I'm a guy and I can't possibly imagine what it would be like to be on the other side of the fence and have to kiss a dude with a decently big beard!", "After many years of wanting to try it and being called disgusting every time and giving in? Yeah, I'd tell her idgaf either. \n\nShe's been entirely unreasonable in how she speaks to him about his appearance. Unless he asks what she thinks about it, she needs to hush.", "Keep in mind that beards can be coarse and scratchy. She might not want that on her face or elsewhere.", "Just know that you have autonomy over growing a beard but your wife may no longer be attracted to you. Weigh the pros vs cons here.", "My only advice is to actually care and wash your beard properly if you do grow one. I've seen too many gross people who don't wash it adequately or use beard oil, and it just ends up being disgusting. No one wants to kiss that.", "Imagine not getting upset and eventually exploding at your spouse telling you something akin to \"I don't like how you look, change it\" after a while. \ud83d\ude12", "\u201cShe has to look at you\u201d. What a stupid thought.", "Funny story. My old English teacher was half Japanese and had that long luscious thick straight black hair. Her husband LOVED it!!! One week she decided to cut her hair. He assured her one of them would have long hair so if she cut it\u2026he would grow his out. She cut it. He stuck to his word. He grew his hair out. Dude looked like bozo the clown if he had had dishwash blond hair lol. That college professor was bald on the top and the hair was curly frizzy. They played that out for over a year. It was hilarious. He grew it out until hers grew back out. She decided her having long hair wasn\u2019t as bad as his long hair. Rofl.", "Yeah, your wife shouldn\u2019t call you gross or disgusting. Telling you she prefers you without a beard or that she doesn\u2019t like it because it\u2019s itchy is fine. Using derogatory language is not. That is definitely something you should address with her.", "i feel like a lot of these comments are missing the point. she is allowed to have her preference for sure and you can also do what you want with your body as well. but from what im reading the issue is more her tone and word choice? i would never dream of describing anything about the person im with or anyone i care about for that matter as \"disgusting\". there are more respectful ways she could express concerns about hygiene or the physical feeling of the hair touching her. \n\nsure you could also have responded more gently but i think you probably reached a breaking point when it came to the repeated disrespect when it came to how she addresses a choice in your appearance that she doesn't prefer.", "Ignore that other person talking here. I'm a woman and I bet you look great with a beard, because everyone looks great when they're happy with how they look. \n\nMy bonus dad grows out a beard every fall to play Jesus in his church's Christmas play. Gift yourself a nice beard kit like he did, with some trimmers to trim the bits growing too fast and keep your mouth clear, a good comb, and whatever else y'all have in those kits (might I recommend some argon or coconut oil to moisturize and strengthen the hair so that it grows faster longer?). \n\nTell your wife something like- \"Your comments on my appearance have been heard and given the consideration they deserve.\" Or \"I won't comment negatively on your appearance because I love you and want you to feel good. You shouldn't comment negatively on mine, it's inappropriate and it hurts my feelings for no good reason. Please stop.\"", "If it\u2019s not a good looking beard then maybe she\u2019s right, if it\u2019s a respectable beard then NTA\n\nTo call you disgusting is wrong though", "Your wife is telling you she finds it disgusting. She may not like how it feels on her skin. It may be itchy. You\u2019re more worried about how you look in the mirror to yourself vs your wife who has to look at you all the time. You don\u2019t give a f what she thinks\u2026and she doesn\u2019t have to give a f about you\u2026but she does.", "She wants a boy not a man", "Yeah bro time to face facts\u2026you\u2019re an Asshole.  I\u2019m sure deep down you know it, but since you asked if your wife doesn\u2019t like the beard you don\u2019t need it.  And don\u2019t expect any sex unless it\u2019s some other bearded dude", "She likes your pretty face the way it is", "Yeah, I've seen horror stories of facial hair related injuries. It sounds stupid, but with men who have really thick stubble who leave it 'raspy', it can rub a face raw and lead to infection. The same can be done with full facial hair, and the chances increase depending on the hygiene level.", "I don\u2019t have much of a beard myself because if I try to let it grow how I really want it my patches show so I have to keep it kinda low and shaped up and my wife loves it. But I do use a cream conditioner and a light oil to keep it soft, smelling good, healthy and help with growth. I wish the best brother and continue to do what makes you happy.", "W man right here!", "What if she skipped altogether and just let them grow out totally the way you are with a beard? Cause a couple of weeks regrowth isn't really much :)", "If you have never grown your beard out, then you should totally do it.  You can always shave it off again.", "Has she ever had a hairstyle you don\u2019t like? This is just a hairstyle she doesn\u2019t like for you. \n\nIf you don\u2019t grow a beard you should be clear what hairstyle she should have because of your preference.\n\nMy wife knows my preference and has still had short hair, hair that is black, purple, or even blonde with pink streaks. And I have changed from clean shaven, to stubble, goatee, medium thick, and even completely wild and overgrown. She has asked me to not to just have a mustache and I asked her to get rid of the nose ring.", "Oh well if it\u2019s just temporary that\u2019s totally reasonable.", "Not at all. I\u2019m a woman and I think body hair is gross. To each their own, but I think it\u2019s worth taking steps to look good for the person you\u2019re with if it doesn\u2019t put you out too much.", "That\u2019s insane. Literally hundreds of millions of men have perfectly hygienic and well-groomed beards. It\u2019s not a bird\u2019s nest, it\u2019s his hair!", "This", "OP getting upset isn't the issue, not is telling his wife she doesn't get a vote in it.  But swearing & yelling at her is over the line into AH territory.", "yes, agreed!! she is allowed to have her opinions, but the verbal abuse is not good and he doesn\u2019t have to deal with it.", "Too bad Reddit decided to do away with awards.  This comment surely deserves one.  I guess this will have to suffice. \ud83e\udd47\ud83d\ude0a", "Jesus H Christos, what am I reading?? This guy\u2019s WIFE is calling his appearance disgusting to his face and people in these comments are trying to both-sides it? Dude. Imagine if he told his wife she looked *disgusting* without makeup, and the comments said well fair enough he\u2019s the one who has to actually see her face all day\u2026 I feel like I\u2019m taking crazy pills", "Hahahaha this is exactly the comment I'd expect from someone with a post history like yours", "Are you for real?", "Yes! My boyfriend apologized to me because he can't grow a beard but it's a blessing after all of those horror stories.", "Fuck that", "Man a couple of weeks skipping shaving gets me to absolute goat levels of hairiness. I'm jealous of people with slow-growing hair lol.", "I'd love her just the same!", "I feel like you're being intentionally obnoxious and obtuse. You know what he means and what he's trying to say.", "It's his fuckin face.", "I'm a dude into other dudes.  Keep it trimmed around the lips (no hair curled up inside your mouth) and it doesn't make one fucking bit of difference on the kissing.  Just give her a little lip that she can still suck on and don't let that be a reason not to do it.", "She called how he looks disgusting to his face. He\u2019s allowed to be angry.", "I normally really hate \"if the genders were reversed comments but this one makes sense... like I grow my body hair as a woman and nobody has to LIKE that but saying it's disgusting to someone you purport to care about is gross", "If he thinks lipstick/lipgloss or whatever is nasty and gross and doesn\u2019t want to kiss her\u2026that would be the equivalent. (Not her not wearing makeup.) She doesn\u2019t like the alteration he wants to make. I would say the same. If you don\u2019t like the make up. Speak up. If she chooses to wear it\u2026she can suffer the consequences of no pda or wherever it goes. What\u2019s good for the goose is good for the gander.", "Yes. Someone who thinks a spouse should be able to communicate their needs and wants to their partner. 100%!!! If OP has a problem with the makeup his wife wears or wants to wear\u2026he should speak up too. My husband doesn\u2019t like the sticky shiny lipgloss. He thinks it\u2019s nasty and icky. Instead of getting my feelings hurt I altered my makeup choices to be beneficial to both of us lol. He has to look at me in that makeup. He has to kiss me in my makeup (or he can choose not too if I\u2019m wearing something he thinks has a nasty texture/feel). I choose to make accommodations for him so he will find me attractive and want to kiss me. The coin flips both ways.", "Ah it might be cause I wax some of mine so I get a slower grow back, but even so surely it would take a few weeks to be at full length cause it doesn't actually grow any faster than head hair?", "That's really nice to hear! I'm so used to guys being weird about it and calling it gross (which actually, may be why your wife thinks it's okay to say something like that to you about your choice of body hair). If there was a zombie apocalypse tomorrow I hope she wouldn't call you gross when shaving became a thing of the past \ud83d\ude43", "I detect no double standards here. Looks NTA to me!", "Nah I was just asking cus I was curious. I've even replied to his reply to me. I'm on his side!", "Same logic if she wants to gain 50 lbs or get some wild piercings?", "Women have more sensitive skin. My husband stays clean shaven because for me, it stings, itches, and causes a rash around my mouth.", "Yeah, I'd be angry too.  But I wouldn't yell at my wife with \"I don't give a fuck what you think.\", which is what OP did.  He needed to choose better words and not scream is all I'm saying.", "No, the comparison was correct.  A beard naturally grows.  Shaving or trimming is the modification.  Just as makeup is a modification to how a person naturally looks.", "I agree with speaking up, but calling your life partner disgusting should be reserved for things that are more severe than \"I don't like beards/lipgloss\". That's not a healthy way to communicate in a relationship.", "That\u2019s not equivalent at all, lmao. Does lipstick grow out of your face and neck every day and need to be scraped away with time-consuming or uncomfortable blades? No. A better equivalent would be something like pubic or armpit hair, and a guy calling his wife disgusting for letting her hair grow naturally would not have as many backers in this sub I suspect.", "The difference between waxing and shaving is pretty stark, I think. Hair has a lot of root, so if you yank it out at the root, it takes a long time to get back to visible length. Also, waxing damages the hair follicles so it starts growing back slower the more you do it. I've hardly ever waxed, so my hair follicles are still at close to maximum output lol\n\nIt grows about the same rate as head hair I guess, but my head hair grows *fast* too. It sheds frequently and grows quickly to make up for it. I've about hit my maximum length now because I just haven't gotten around to having it cut in ages, but at the rate I shed, I'm astonished that I still have so much of it lol. I think it's largely genetically determined? People actually have individual maximum hair lengths based on the rate of growth vs. the speed of shedding.\n\nOf course, I am also kinda terrible at determining the passage of time. So it may well be that my idea of how quickly hair grows is skewed!", "And I\u2019m sure as he\u2019s said it would change nothing. Cuz some of us love our partners unconditionally. Doesn\u2019t matter how they look. Weight gain is only bad when it\u2019s unhealthy and hair is fucking hair. She\u2019ll get used to it just like my partner has. If they love you for you then the style of hair, piercings, tattoos or weight has no bearing on anything.", "Where does it say he yelled and screamed? It doesn\u2019t. It says he blew up, which even if we take to mean in volume and not just tone I still think would be understandable with such an unacceptable insult from his wife.", "I disagree. The growing of the beard is a modification to his status quo. He\u2019s more than welcome to grow it out. His body his choice. But she can find it disgusting and choose to not have intimate relations with him. She may not be communicating the best way possible but she\u2019s telling him she isn\u2019t ok with the beard. She\u2019s telling him she is not attracted to that lifestyle choice. It\u2019s ultimately his decision but there will be consequences. It is what it is", "You\u2019re assuming she didn\u2019t try communicating in other ways. You\u2019re assuming she jumped straight to this. The reality is\u2026she probably tried multiple different ways before jumping to this point.", "This has been a really unexpected but interesting conversation thank you! The human body is weird and wonderful in so many ways, and I love actually getting to hear about how other people's bodies work. It makes me feel more normal anyway! X", "> I finally blew up and said babe I I don't give a f\\*\\*\\* if you like beards or not!\n\nSecond to last sentence of OP's post.", "How can growing a beard be a modification to the status quo when it\u2019s literally only possible by *not* intervening to stop it? It\u2019s HAIR. It\u2019s as status quo as it gets! It\u2019s not like a tattoo he can\u2019t get rid of easily. He can experiment with a beard and shave it later if he likes, but the idea of that somehow making it okay to call your life partner\u2019s face disgusting is itself\u2026 disgusting.", "She doesn't get to try multiple ways, if he made a decision he made a decision.  She can either suck it up, or divorce him.  Calling him disgusting to his face is uncalled for no matter how many times they had this discussion."]}
