She has her rights too.", "NTA, but you have to understand that it could lessen your intimacy. Particularly if you wind up having bad beard hygiene. Food, sweat, dirt, all get trapped in there and some guys are really bad at maintaining it because they feel it's just like washing your face. Having a luscious beard takes work. A lot of work. And oils. And she might just find it repulsive to have hair pressed against her face to give you a kiss. Beard hair can often feel a lot like pubic hair (depending on the hair growth), and that's 'gross' for some people. Then again, some women love men with big full beards, so if you grow a beard, you might just wind up needing to find a new wife if she finds it unattractive. Don't get all weird if she doesn't like kissing you or being intimate. She might just not be into it. Don't pressure her. But you have to figure out what you want more. THIS wife or a beard.", "NTA. Your face your choice of course. But do keep it well groomed? Is it neat? Do you keep it shaped up? Well oiled? Or are you wolfing it and going for the more rustic look? I\u2019m definitely on your side but to play devils advocate maybe it\u2019s how the beard looks not how it looks on you per say", "I married a beardless man. He now has a beard. I don\u2019t like it. It makes him look old and I believe it\u2019s unhygienic. I feel if I made such a dramatic change in my facial appearance (eg shaved my head) my partner would be within his rights to object. Ultimately though, it\u2019s up to the individual to decide on how they present themselves. What you can\u2019t control though is how your partner responds. If they no longer find you attractive, are you prepared to give up that part of your life? NTA, but maybe have a think.", "NTA. My ex husband & I were together 16 years, I liked him with a beard, and thought he looked a lot better than without. But once It started getting longer, he would drop food in it and not notice. The man would spend hours brushing it, oiling it, styling it, etc, but he\u2019d still drop food in it, or get food/drinks in the mustache part, and it would just be disgusting. It finally got to the point where I told him to cut it back to just a normal short beard. He refused, so one night I sent him to town to grab something from the store for me right after I\u2019d made spaghetti\u2026 didn\u2019t tell him he had bits of meat sauce in his beard. He come right home and shaved it back immediately.   Grow your beard. Just keep it neat and foodless. Maybe it makes me an AH, but I\u2019d have divorced him over it shortly if he hadn\u2019t have shaved.", "NTA\n\nOh wow.  So, my husband has always worn a beard.  \n\nFor a while before we got together he was keeping it longer.  But by the time we got together he was keeping it shorter.  But the style he kept with it at that time was a little unusual.  No mustache, but kind of a big square down his neck?  So he'd shave the sides near the sideburns, and trim up the bottom at the neck, leaving just this largeish square.  I find him very attractive regardless but I wasn't a huge fan of this style specifically.\n\nOne day I suggested he try trimming it up to more of a goatee, narrower and without going down the neck.  Did mention that I like goatees.  He said he'd give it a shot and see what he thought.  He turned out to like it, so he's kept it that way ever since.  No mustache, just the goatee, sometimes a little tighter, sometimes with a bit more depth toward the neck.  Often lets the stubble grow out.\n\nI suggested.  Without insulting.  And he had every right to say no.  If he'd refused, I'd have accepted that.  Because it's his beard.  It's his choice.  He gave it a shot because ultimately he was willing to do so.  He kept it because he likes it.  The fact that I like it is a bonus, not the point.\n\nThat's not the situation you have here.  She's being pushy and insulting.  Of course you finally lost patience with it.\n\nIt is not okay that she's being insulting about this.  \"You look disgusting,\" seriously?  That's no way to speak to one's partner.  You deserve better than that.", "I kind of get her point. I find mustaches disgusting. Couldn\u2019t even kiss someone with one. But also it\u2019s your body and you can decorate it as you wish.", "NTA because it's your face.

It's your face.", "NTA. It's your body, and I'm sure she'd tell you to f\\*ck off if you demanded she keep her legs shaved baby-smooth or you'll think she's disgusting.", "This one depends.

YTA if you want her to be attached to you. \nNTA if you dgaf about her wanting to let you stick parts of your body in hers", "The way I look at it is my wife is the one who has to look at me far more than I ever look in a mirror.  It's okay to have opinions about our spouses hair upkeep, I know I do with my wife and try not to mention when she's lazy.  She usually makes a remark after the second day of me not shaving", "ESH. She can give her opinion but at the end of the day it\u2019s your decision. However\u2026I would never do something to my body that my husband hated bc\u2026he has to look at me. Lol.

But I have told my husband that facial hair, at any length, causes my skin to break out when I get too close.  So he can go ahead and have facial hair, but I won\u2019t be kissing him while he has it.  My husband hasn\u2019t had facial hair for 27 years, because he likes kissing me.

Gotta keep your composure about something this small tbh", "I know I\u2019ll be with the minority but I kinda would say ESH. She may not be attracted to you with a beard and she has expressed that.

Short of an actual hygiene issue OP it\u2019s just a goddamn beard. Experiment with it, have fun grooming it, shave it off if you change your mind. Blowing up at your wife isn\u2019t great but if I called my girl\u2019s face *disgusting* because of how she chose to groom it I\u2019d expect a few harsh words too.\n\nFunny how bodily autonomy and the right to look  how you want doesn\u2019t extend to men.

My wife feels as though I should want her to like my appearance but it has now gotten to a point that I don't really care and want to do this for myself. This is why I'm asking if I'm an a******.", "The problem with what your wife's saying isn't her objection to you growing out your beard. She has as much right to not like changes you make to your body as you have the right to do to it what you want. \n\nThe issue is that she's being disrespectful as hell. You're NTA. But she definitely is. \n\nYou don't call your spouse disgusting to their face unless they are engaging in nasty activities such as shooting loads of semen in a laundry room or growing mold spores on Iranian yogurt. Growing a beard isn't disgusting and most men manage to keep their beards clean. \\[I myself have a goatee and my wife loves it; she wishes that I grew out both my beard and hair the way her dad has since the 1970s, but that's not for me for now.\\]\n\nShe can object to you growing a beard. But she has no right to be an asshole about it. You are the man she loves, and when you love someone, you criticize with love, not denigrate or insult them. I dare say that you need to sit her down during a quiet moment, express to her how her comments are insulting, hurtful and unloving, and that you will no longer tolerate her insults. One more of these and she will have hell to pay!\n\nYou deserve respect, even if you don't deserve unqualified support for changes to your body. There's a way that your wife can not show support without being downright rude, insulting, cruel, crude and immature.

It applies to you as well as to her.", "WTF are these comments??? NTA at all! Your wife is a super asshole though. These comments would be flipping the fuck out if it was a husband calling a wife disgusting for cutting her hair, not shaving her legs, or wearing/not wearing make up.

Because you are called in marriage to be better than that. You *should* care about her preferences. What makes her comfortable. You should be willing to sacrifice things that she cares about for her comfort, and she should reciprocate that back towards you. That's a healthy marriage--where when spouses tell each other something that really bothers them, they compromise and find a middle ground.\n\nThis mindset of \"my wife can f off\" is gross.

Soap has been invented a long ass time ago.\n\nIf you don't wash yourself you're going to stink, beard or not, woman or man...", "I agree with you but personally I think my own leg hair is gross lol.  I shave for my own self, I like they way it feels.", "Not only does that study not mention anything about head hair, but also to quote the very article you posted\n\n\"This study did not address shaving habits or facial hygiene routines. On the other hand, another study by Wakeam et al suggested that bearded men do not harbor more virulent bacteria in their beards and that clean-shaven men were more likely to be colonized with potential nosocomial pathogens.\\[6\\] The authors examined several factors that McLure et al did not consider, such as the use of soap during face washing, but did not take into consideration the shaving habits in clean-shaven men.\\[5,6\\] The human skin microbiome differs significantly between individuals from different geographic locations.\\[4\\] Both of the studies discussed above were conducted in the western world; the microbiome in the west may differ from that in the Middle East. To our knowledge, there is no available data from the Middle East regarding the facial microbiological flora of bearded versus clean-shaven medical professionals.This study aimed to estimate the facial bacterial floral load and identify strains and antimicrobial resistance profiles in bearded versus nonbearded men in the operating room in one of the largest tertiary medical centers in the Middle East. Multiple confounding factors were considered, including the use of soap for daily face washing, shaving habits, working hours, smoking status, and comorbidities.\"\n\nThis says the the study didn't take into account not only the differences in personal hygiene between shaven and non shaven people, but also the natural difference in bacteria that occurs in different areas around the world.  And again they only tested bearded vs not bearded, they did not test beard hair vs head hair. It seems you didn't even read the study you posted.", "I'm the kewchie crusader ik \ud83d\ude15", "Stop praising the bare minimum. Nobody here is a child, and this isn't a soccer game. You don't get participation awards for just being there.\n\nGrow up.", "I'm not focusing on OP doing the right thing. I'm focusing on the fact that so many people are congratulating him for it. The same way OP's wife wouldn't (and shouldn't) be congratulated if she didn't tell him to shave his beard, he shouldn't be congratulated for it either. Are y'all telling me you'd want to be praised for not being rude to your partner????\n\nAnd another thing, why are y'all so against one person saying that the bare minimum shouldn't be congratulated? OP's wife can't do the bare minimum, and that's sad and all, but he shouldn't be praised because of it. I do agree that he's a good man for not caring about body hair, but I also agree with the fact that he's doing the bare minimum.", "Yes, I agree! It's been fun, and it's important to talk about bodies because a lot about bodies remains a *mystery* to people, which can cause all sorts of problems. The only way to solve that is to talk about it!\n\nEdit: Ooh! Another fun hair fact! Chemotherapy causes hair to fall out, but then when the hair grows back in after chemo is done, it can grow in *differently.* Like, faster beard growth than before, or a fuller beard, for example. Hank Green has [a really interesting video about it.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PCYKpj56Ss8)", "Kind of what I said in my original comment, but also, I think that for me personally, it's a mental thing more than anything. Like if you dropped food on the floor and gave it a wash and you technically know there's nothing wrong with it, but it still kinda gives you the ick?", "Yeah but I'm willing to bet you don't have a rule against dating men with hands..  of course you're entitled to your preferences but I feel the hygiene argument with beards is disingenuous, like men who feel the need to justify their preference for thinner women by bringing up health reasons which, while can be true, are rarely the actual reason why they find it unattractive", "Just because they can doesn't mean they will or do.  Some people are just gross.", "Stop being the barrier to the very progress you want to see.\n\nFuck off.", "while i agree that men get praised for the minimum in a relationship (especially when being a father), I also think u should get over yourself lol. At least in this specific scenario.", "You went out of your way to complain about someone complementing a man for being a good person. Why make this about men not reaching the bar when this story is about a woman not reaching it? Despite his wife treating him so poorly, he never responds in kind and still treats her with respect and love (which is definitely better than the bare minimum when you are being treated badly) and here you are attacking someone complimenting him on that and making this about men needing to do better, when it's a woman in this story that is the problem. I think this makes your biases pretty apparent.", "See I actually know this about chemo for sad reasons, my mum had cancer in her 20s and was accidentally \"overdosed\" on the chemo. Her hair used to be long and thick, but it never grew back again properly, she's always looked like she's thinning or going bald and it never grows longer than her shoulders. It's been really hard on her over the years but I'm really glad she's alive nonetheless!  \n   \nI will check out the Hank green video too!  \n   \nI also follow a dude on tiktok who has alopecia and his hair is growing back. The patches where he lost his hair are growing back blonde and curly but the rest of his hair is straight and dark. It looks really unusual but kinda cool, people keep thinking he's dyed his hair that way but it's just the body being weird again haha :)", "I had a friend that went from really straight thin hair to super kinky somewhat coarse curls! I know similar can happen to kids too. My son was born extremely blonde and now has medium brown hair. My hair was nearly black for a few years, and has been a medium brown since (now some grays too).", "And your personal ick would justify saying to your husband\u2019s face that he looks disgusting?", "And that is a separate issue with the person the beard belongs to, not with the beard itself, so what's your point?", "Speak for yourself. We won't get progress if we don't let people know that they shouldn't be praised for treating people like humans. You're only mad because you wanna be praised for the bare minimum.\n\nGrow tf up and stop whining.", "So do women, right?", "I very simply said 'W man for doing the bare minimum' and all of a sudden I'm a barrier, I lost my shit, I'm all these types of things, all for asking a question. But yes, I need to get over myself. Absolutely..", "No, I'm not saying any of that. It's more than the bare minimum that he treats her with love and respect when she keeps badmouthing him over his hair, but it IS the bare minimum that he's getting praised for doing what she isn't. \n\nAnd if we wanna talk about biases, we should talk about how I literally asked a question and suddenly this became a situation about me attacking a man. Nobody was attacking OP. I didn't say that he was anything bad. I wasn't even talking to him. I said that nobody should be praised for the bare minimum. The fact that y'all's heads are so far up yalls asses that y'all can't get over the fact that again, this is not a kids soccer game, and that you don't deserve a participation award simply for being there, is something that y'all need to figure out. Jesus Christ. You aitarians get so mad over the smallest shit.\n\nYou're going out of your way to complain about an internet stranger saying 'w man for doing the bare minimum?'. It was six letters and one word, and y'all are acting like I just said all men need to be euthanized. \ud83d\ude10", "Well my husband would agree with me so that might be a bad example. I think it's important how she reacted afterwards. If his feelings are actually hurt, she should apologise and just say \"hey, it's not for me, so I won't kiss you, but you do you\"", "My point was what I said in my first post.  Yes soap exists but that doesn't mean it's used.  I still think they'd stink and be covered in old food, mucus, spit and whatever else has touched them."]}
