For context, my mom doesn't speak english too well and doesn't understand technology. We don't come from a family of a ton of extra money so the $250 spent was kind of a big expense. To be clear, I am very grateful for the gift, and for the fact that they were even willing to spend that much on me.\n\nI go to college and have been wanting an iPad for forever to make it easier for note-taking, and have been talking about it and they know that. A week prior to my birthday I got a call from my mom asking if I have ever heard of an apple watch. uh oh. Me, aware that its a week before my birthday I explain that I have, but I really don't have a lot of use for one, and they are kind of a waste of money in my opinion. I told her that if she really wanted to get me something in that regard I have been wanting an iPad to take notes on but I know its really expensive so I am fine with just going out to eat or something. She understands and the call ends.\n\nI don\u2019t really ask for things, so after having this conversation with her I accidentally got my hopes up for this potential iPad I could be getting for my birthday. It's the day of my birthday and I open my gift and its the very thing I called useless a week prior. I say my thank you's to both my brother and mom for going through the trouble but inside I can't help but be a little heartbroken.\n\nIt's now the day after my birthday and I look up the cost of the Apple Watch and see that it's half the price of the iPad that I could potentially have. I delicately ask my mom if it would be ok if I returned it and used the money for the iPad and I could pay the difference. She completely understood and was fine with it, and explained that she tried to persuade my brother in the purchasing process but he just dismissed her and said iPad's were too expensive.\n\nI then go to my brother and say I wanted to return it but I really appreciated the thought anyway. He was very clearly heartbroken and I saw some tears form in his eyes, as he says he feels like he failed. He says \"Sorry for getting such a shitty gift.\" COMPLETE opposite reaction from my mom and I felt so awful for even suggesting the idea, I had no idea he was going to react that way. Now IM crying and he's almost crying and its a whole thing.\n\nIn the end I decided to keep it because I just felt so so bad. It's been a few months, and I do acknowledge that it's a cool gift, but the only reasons I use it is to look at my heart rate and to track my runs. I am aware that this story also comes across as me being ungrateful, but part of my reaction also stems from the idea that it feels like my family barely even knows me sometimes, so getting something that was just so out of left field, after I explained that I didn\u2019t want one was kind of a downer. I still feel guilty and was looking for some outside opinions.

It's ok to get your hopes up and then feel a little disappointed- you weren't mean about it, you handled it appropriately.\n\nBeing from a poorer background myself, I would guess your brother's reaction is rooted at least partly in embarrassment- he knew what you wanted and that he couldn't afford it- this just confirmed for him that yet again not having money ruins stuff and he has no control over that. It sucks to feel that way, but you didn't do anything wrong.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGo ahead and return the watch, get an iPad and maybe take your brother to dinner.", "NAH. Your brother\u2019s emotional reaction is bizarre, tbh, and would piss me off, but that\u2019s probable *me* being an AH. You handled all of this very maturely, as did your mum.", "NAH. I completely understand why you want the iPad and you did the right thing in asking the gift-givers for their blessing. While your brother IMHO was a bit extra in how he responded, I can't completely fault him in his response. Honestly, you should've gotten the iPad if that was going to be more useful to you. No need to feel guilty.", "NAH \n\nThey chose to get you a gift you didn\u2019t really want, but they did it with the best intentions. You\u2019re not an AH for wanting something different, or for asking how they felt about you returning it. Your brother\u2019s reaction seems a bit odd, but still, no AH\u2019s in this story!", "NTA\n\nJust return it and get what you want. Maybe your brother is sensitive but his reaction was very passive. I would just explain that you like the watch but you don't use often enough to justify keeping it when you need the ipad for school.", "NAH. Who knows what your brother could be srruggling with right now. Maybe it just carried over.", "NAH  \n\n\nand you would not be wrong for trading in the Apple Watch for an iPad either.", "NTA - Trade it for the iPad that you can use, want, and need. Your mother's reaction makes sense,  your brother's reaction does not. There's no need to feel guilty.", "NTA. You're not ungrateful. You TOLD your family you had no use for an Apple watch, and now your brother is upset you don't like something you explicitly said you didn't need? Also, you don't even want an iPad for fun (well, it would also serve for that but), it would help you at college, and your family is tight on money so you can't get both. If still possible, please go ahead and return the watch.", "No judgement here but FWIW, I have an iPad, I love it and use it everyday - but I think it sucks for taking notes.", "Nta. I wouldn't have even asked \"permission\" .once given it is yours to sell smash donate or whatever you choose to do.\nA gift you don't want is not a gift it's a burden.\nAnd honestly getting a gift you have specifically said you don't want is sort of a FU from the giver.\nNext time return what you dislike and get something more useful.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
