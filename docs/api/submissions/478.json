I swam daily in the summer and currently I walk and dance daily. I signed up for a gym and have been going irregularly but now I am beginning to go more regularly. I'm starting to replace my once horrid drink habits with three coffees a week, one pop a week, and the rest of my drinks are water. I'm starting to eat healthier, cooking at home, when I get cravings I replace my once bad meals with celery. I don't make packaged instant snacks anymore (ie noodles). I'm TRYING.\n\nAbout a year ago my brother (10) started calling me fatty and fatass and fat insults. At first I tried to embrace it, like when he started calling me fatty mcgee, I changed my netflix profile name to fatty mcgee. Yeah, I'm fat, what are you gonna do about it? I am who I am. I'm not obese, I'm not bedridden, I'm working to lose weight, so why should I be ashamed? But lately in this past few months, the fat jokes are becoming more plentiful, I'd be called fat at least twice hourly, whenever I come out of my room it's \"Hey, fatty!\" and whenever I sit on the couch (I take up less than one cushion) it's \"move over fatass so we can sit here!\"\n\nTwo weeks ago I made cookies and I told my brother that he had to not call me fat insults if he wanted any cookies. He stopped for that day and that day only. It was my first time ever making cookies and my mother started laughing that they looked ugly and she called me a dunce and she said my cookies were retarded. This was said in a joking manner but it still hurt. She took pictures to show her friends. Same thing when I made cookies the next week. Just insulting how ugly they look. And the fat jokes are still happening. We have this big bowl of candy on the table and my brother takes handfuls at a time but I can't even pass by the bowl without fat jokes.\n\nI'm considering not giving anyone cookies next time I make them. My family is big on sharing everything that's cooked. If one person gets Tim Horton's, they get it for everyone. If someone gets crisps from the store, those crisps are for everyone. The only things we don't share are my mum's 'low' snacks and my father's protein shakes. So obviously, it'd take a real blow to them if I made cookies and refused to share them (I can do this by licking all of the cookies, yeah it's gross but I'm not sharing!) and they'd be really upset. It'd really piss them off and sadden them and they'll likely make something and not share it with me as revenge. But I've had enough of the fat jokes and of my mother insulting everything I do (she doesn't just do it to my cookies). \n\nThis is NOT revenge. I'm just fed up with the insults and I'm seriously dreading making cookies again, even though it's easy and fun. I want to gain the joy back, and something ONLY FOR ME would do that.

That's not a healthy place to be. :( Edited to add: It will be lovely btw. The insulting child will have no one to insult and is likely to start causing problems for them and your mom will have no one to degrade and will likely start going after him and you can just sit back and eat popcorn and watch the shitshow.", "I'd probably start using my weight against the little twerp.

Being called fat all the time must be a pain in the back, baking those cookies seemed like it was some sort of escape.

Give them some of their own medicine. Take revenge. Make awful misshapen cookies then post them saying \"Oh look how bad my cookies turned out. Too bad my mom never taught me to cook and now I have to figure it out myself.\" And get all your friends to say \"So brave. My mom can help you with that.\"\n\nAs for your brother, that is obnoxious but at least he's not a parental figure.

Tell your mom and brother, flat-out, that they shouldn't be surprised. After all, they know you're fat, right? So obviously you eating all the cookies isn't going to be anything unexpected.
