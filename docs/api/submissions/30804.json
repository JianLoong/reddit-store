{"id": 30804, "submission_id": "17t9hff", "title": "AITA for not giving up my seat to a little boy at the airport?", "selftext": "So, I was sitting with my friend at the airport in front of our gate, waiting for a flight. I had admittedly had a bad day so was already not in a great mood at the time. My friend and I were sitting next to each other, and had our bags on the seat on her other side. \n\nAfter we'd been sitting there for around 30 mins, a family of 3 (mother (~35F), father (~45m), and son (~7M)) sat down in the seats across from us. There were only 2 open seats there, so we moved our bags from the seat next to us to make some room.\n\nThe mother and father sat down in the seats while their son was running around, as young kids do. \n\nAbout 5 min later, out of nowhere, the mother comes up to me and my friend and starts berating me for not moving seats so her son could sit \"closer\" to her, as she was sitting directly across from me. Mind you, the seat we cleared up was literally 2 seats down from mine, and there were free seats next to it. \n\nI was confused and told her we cleared the seat so someone of their party could sit there, as there were open seats on that side and the seats on my other side were occupied. Plus, her son was not even sitting down.\n\nShe keeps saying how selfish I am and I argue back at her that she's being ridiculous until her husband steps in and pulls her away. \n\nAfter this interaction I was very annoyed and kept making eye contact with her and rolling my eyes / scoffing. I thought she was completely unjustified to ask us to move when there were plenty of other free seats in the area, but my friend told me that we were \"two stressed-out women\" and both of us were in the wrong. \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1699752831, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17t9hff/aita_for_not_giving_up_my_seat_to_a_little_boy_at/", "score": 140, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Giving up your seat is optional, and frankly, those parents were pretty shitty for taking the seats themselves, instead of letting their kid use one of them.", "NTA\n\nThere were almost certainly other places this family could have sat in the airport where they could have been together.", "NTA One parent sits by you, other parent sits with kid. Problem solved.", "NTA, though you could have let it go. What's up with your friend, though, and the \"two stressed-out women\" nonsense?", "NTA. Maybe a old lady or someone obviously struggling to stand. Not a kid who can sit Indian style on the floor a lot more comfortable than you or I elsewhere.", "NTA. You moved your stuff. There were other open seats. The kid wasn't even sitting down. \n\nYou did nothing wrong.", "NTA.  She should have at least asked.  You weren\u2019t obligated to say yes, but to open the conversation with entitlement and scolding? No ma\u2019am.", "NTA  Doesn't sound like she even asked you to switch seats just berated you for not reading her mind.", "No people should leave each other alone at the airport. Plus 7 is still a good age to sit on your parents lap or sit on the ground.", "NTA. I would have told her to go fuck herself.", "NTA. That woman was either crazy or having a day from hell and a meltdown or both. If her 7 year old son needed a seat that bad she could get up. Or let him sit in one of the other empty seats from the sounds of it.", "NTA \u201cput your kid on a leash and you won\u2019t have a problem\u201d", "NTA.  No further justification required.", "NTA most definitely. I hate how entitled parents act when they're with their kids. It's like they expect everyone to bend over backwards for them by using the 'kid' card. No lady, I'm not giving up my airplane seat because you refused to spend extra money to get all your seats together. Plan it ahead of time and respect other people's money and time.", "NTA\n\nThat's what laps are for. Or one of the parents could sit there.\n\nIf they'd asked me politely, I'd have moved. But berating me would do nothing but cause my ass to be glued to the seat.", "NTA... you cleared the seats you had your bags on. That was considerate", "ESH for continuing to make aggressive eye contact and rolling your eyes and scoffing. She was rude for insisting obviously but you dragged out the conflict by acting like a mean girl.", "ESH\n\nI would have said you were not the asshole, but for this: \"After this interaction I was very annoyed and kept making eye contact with her and rolling my eyes / scoffing\"", "NTA. I agree with you. The other party's mother was being extremely presumptuous, and I wonder if there was a degree of sexism or agism at play.", "NTA", "NTA.", "NTA the entitlement of parents was on full display here. Though I do think the continued eye rolling and eye contact was a bit much, it's only extending the drama.", "NTA\n\nPersonally, I\u2019d have told her to fuck off.", "NTA you and your friend already moved your bags to be considerate. The mom was clearly the AH.", "NTA, she is one entitled parent though", "NTA. No explanation needed", "NTA. Why couldn\u2019t one parent sit in the seat you cleared while the other parent sat in one of the two seats they chose with their son? \n\nHaving kids doesn\u2019t make them the center of the universe. I\u2019m a mom and would never expect people to move for me or my kids. We aren\u2019t any more entitled to sit than anyone else.", "Nah, you weren't two stressed-out women. You were one considerate woman and one entitled, hostile brat. (Hint:  You were the considerate one.)\n\nIf your friend is male, I'd really worry about his attitude toward women in general.  Yikes.\n\nNTA", "NTA. maybe you should have not continued to mock her with eye contact or eye rolling after. but the wife can just go fuck herself. she is probably jealous of you and your friend.", "[removed]", "NTA. In fact, she\u2019s lucky you didn\u2019t go off on her because I would have. Her feelings would have been real hurt.", "NTA.  \n\nEntitled mom can\u2019t control or expect anything from you OP.\n\nWhat SHE can control is taking possession of her kid and making him sit in the seat next to her and having her husband the grown ass man go sit with OP where the bag had been moved.", "NTA", "Entitled cranky woman who thinks the world revolves around her. NTA.", "There are a lot of people that think their kids are the first to inhabit the Earth.", "They could also let the kid sit in their laps", "I agree that she\u2019s NTA but disagree that the parents should\u2019ve let the kid have one of the seats. Unless you mean kid plus parent in those seats and other parent in other seat. Kid can sit on the floor. Kids sit on the floor all the time.", "Also, as much as I hate kids running around, a kid moving around an airport (supervised and controlled!) is preferable to me than out of control on a plane. It\u2019s miserable for everyone if a kid has too much energy in the air. And that\u2019s where I DO feel bad for the parents because there\u2019s very little they can do about it at that point and they are catching shit from 100+ other people.", "It\u2019s \u201ccross cross apple sauce\u201d now, FYI. Indian style is no longer.", "Good point.", "In what world? My 5 year old can barely fit on my lap(I\u2019m short, he\u2019s tall). Even without the height it\u2019s not normal for a 7 year old to sit on an adults lap for an hour. The floor at airports are disgusting. Not saying this mother was necessarily right but your argument is weird.", "Yep, same thought. OP, you were right, you made your point, just drop it after that. Continuing to make eye contact and scoffing nudges you into A H territory, so ESH.", "ESH \nYeah, I was with you OP until the eye rolling and scoffing after it was over.", "Yeah, same thought. ESH", "I love that she did this honestly. That mom was trying to intimidate her and she gave it right back. Too many parents try to use social shame to get their way.", "It\u2019s pretty misogynistic to think that one woman being unhappy with another one is \u201cjealousy\u201d.

All I know is, in a situation like that, as the father of a 13M, I always give my wife and kid first dibs on seats.

Kids need to move.", "I've heard criss-cross applesauce, and that is apparently what [Wikipedia](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/criss-cross_applesauce) thinks.

It\u2019s not ideal, just an option. I would rather sit on the nasty ass airport floor myself than bully someone out of a seat either way. People are so strange", "Not necessarily. Depending on the kid they may sit in a parents lap well into elementary school because they find comfort there. But in my experience most 7 year old boys will only sit in a lap if they are tired or feeling extra snuggly: enter my elementary aged nephew who is a fan of his parents laps to sit on:", "Never heard spoons in the bowl before.", "You're right. I should've made clear that that's my opinion, based on me not wanting to sit in my parents' lap at that age, and my own son not wanting to sit in my lap past the age of 4.\n\nMy experience doesn't correspond to anyone else's, of course."]}
