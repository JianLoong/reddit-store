I had admittedly had a bad day so was already not in a great mood at the time. My friend and I were sitting next to each other, and had our bags on the seat on her other side. \n\nAfter we'd been sitting there for around 30 mins, a family of 3 (mother (~35F), father (~45m), and son (~7M)) sat down in the seats across from us. There were only 2 open seats there, so we moved our bags from the seat next to us to make some room.\n\nThe mother and father sat down in the seats while their son was running around, as young kids do. \n\nAbout 5 min later, out of nowhere, the mother comes up to me and my friend and starts berating me for not moving seats so her son could sit \"closer\" to her, as she was sitting directly across from me. Mind you, the seat we cleared up was literally 2 seats down from mine, and there were free seats next to it. \n\nI was confused and told her we cleared the seat so someone of their party could sit there, as there were open seats on that side and the seats on my other side were occupied. Plus, her son was not even sitting down.\n\nShe keeps saying how selfish I am and I argue back at her that she's being ridiculous until her husband steps in and pulls her away. \n\nAfter this interaction I was very annoyed and kept making eye contact with her and rolling my eyes / scoffing. I thought she was completely unjustified to ask us to move when there were plenty of other free seats in the area, but my friend told me that we were \"two stressed-out women\" and both of us were in the wrong. \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1699752831, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17t9hff/aita_for_not_giving_up_my_seat_to_a_little_boy_at/", "score": 1796, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
