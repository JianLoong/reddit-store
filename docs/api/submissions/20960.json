Your friend beat you to the punch. Sorry.\n\nIt's not uncommon for people to hold a birthday party on  a different date than their actual birthday. Sometimes someone whose birthday falls on a Wednesday might have a party on the weekend when people are off from work.\n\nSince your friend has already sent out invites for Saturday, consider trying to make plans for Friday  evening or Sunday instead.

If it's once every 5 years, it's important to you. You have a friend who shares a mutual group and a birthday close by, Guess what, YOU GET THE INVITES OUT.

It's understandable that you would have preferred your friends to consider moving their party to another day, especially since it's only once every few years that your birthday coincides with a Saturday.\n\nHowever, it's important to remember that everyone has the right to celebrate their birthday on the day that works best for them. While it would have been considerate of your friends to accommodate your request, they are not obligated to do so. Ultimately, it's up to each individual to decide how they want to celebrate their special day.\r  \n\r  \nIn this situation, it might be helpful to have an open and honest conversation with your friends about your feelings. Let them know that you were hoping to have your own celebration on your birthday and that it's disappointing for you that they have chosen the same day for their party. However, it's important to approach the conversation with understanding and respect for their own plans and decisions.\r  \n\r  \nConsider finding a compromise or alternative solution, such as celebrating with your friends on a different day or finding a way to incorporate both celebrations into one event. Ultimately, the goal is to maintain your friendships and find a way to enjoy your birthday while respecting everyone's choices.", "NTA, it\u2019s perfectly natural to feel annoyed (and not only that it\u2019s weird!!)

Why? Why is your birthday more important than theirs? Why would they put you before themselves or even think they owe you an explanation or consideration. Before you saw the invite did you give any consideration to this friend and how she would have trouble celebrating her B-day on a sunday and in a new town  if she wanted a party? Why are you more important? Please consider these questions and place yourself in another's place and try to come up with some reason they should give you more consideration then you give them.
