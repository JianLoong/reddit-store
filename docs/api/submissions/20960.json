If anything I would talk to them and see if they wanted to plan a double birthday. I think that could be really fun especially if there is a lot of overlap in the friend\u2019s group.", "ESH but you know what, u can do a Friday night party with maybe a sleepover, that way you celebrate your birthday the day before and that day too.", "Using this logic, I should be enraged that I can't go to dinner on my birthday (Valentine's day) without a reservation.", "Info: are you 12?", "YTA - You don't get exclusive rights to holding events on Saturday just because youe birthday falls on that day of the week this year. Your friend beat you to the punch. Sorry.\n\nIt's not uncommon for people to hold a birthday party on  a different date than their actual birthday. Sometimes someone whose birthday falls on a Wednesday might have a party on the weekend when people are off from work.\n\nSince your friend has already sent out invites for Saturday, consider trying to make plans for Friday  evening or Sunday instead. Or if you want it on Saturday so bad, hold a party the following Saturday.", "YTA - you are not The main character.", "ESH you basically share a birthday. Why don\u2019t you have a birthday brunch earlier in the day? They beat you to the punch on sending out invitations but they can\u2019t stop you from doing something earlier in the day and making sure everyone knows it\u2019s your birthday. Maybe even a birthday girl sash or tiara.", "Lol YTA.  They got invites out first, sucks to suck.", "NAH. Depends how close your friends are. This doesn't mean that the other friend value is more important. I don't even keep track of my best friends bdays and store them in a google calendar.\n\nThat's why its always important to ask in advance unless they're planning a surprise for you.", "YTA. If it's once every 5 years, it's important to you. You have a friend who shares a mutual group and a birthday close by, Guess what, YOU GET THE INVITES OUT. No one has a party on a Sunday night, with school and work the next day. They celebrate on the nearest Saturday. \n\nI have a good friend who has the same birth date as me. We also share some mutual friends, and if we want to celebrate, we coordinate or celebrate together.", "YTA. Did you get an invite? Why not celebrate your birthday with theirs?", "NTA so long as you don't pitch a hissy fit to them and be mature about your feelings. I don't see why they wouldn't just plan a joint party though, that's what makes me think your friends are douches and don't really care about your feelings", "NTA\n\nBirthdays are special occasions, and it's natural to want to have your own celebration on your actual birthday, especially if it falls on a Saturday. It's understandable that you would have preferred your friends to consider moving their party to another day, especially since it's only once every few years that your birthday coincides with a Saturday.\n\nHowever, it's important to remember that everyone has the right to celebrate their birthday on the day that works best for them. While it would have been considerate of your friends to accommodate your request, they are not obligated to do so. Ultimately, it's up to each individual to decide how they want to celebrate their special day.\r  \n\r  \nIn this situation, it might be helpful to have an open and honest conversation with your friends about your feelings. Let them know that you were hoping to have your own celebration on your birthday and that it's disappointing for you that they have chosen the same day for their party. However, it's important to approach the conversation with understanding and respect for their own plans and decisions.\r  \n\r  \nConsider finding a compromise or alternative solution, such as celebrating with your friends on a different day or finding a way to incorporate both celebrations into one event. Ultimately, the goal is to maintain your friendships and find a way to enjoy your birthday while respecting everyone's choices.", "NTA, it\u2019s perfectly natural to feel annoyed (and not only that it\u2019s weird!!) The polite thing for them to have done was to compromise and maybe try to make it a joint party. Ultimately while other commenters are right that nobody \u201cowns\u201d a day, birthdays are indeed special and it\u2019s more than fine to feel disappointed that other people want you to come to celebrate THEM on their birthday without acknowledging yours.", "Lol NAH this isn\u2019t a thing!", "nta your friend doesn't care about you", "Nta", "I would try to figure out a way to combine birthdays for the future rather than having this yearly competition.", "Honey, I don't think these people are your friends.", "Are they celebrating somebody else's birthday on your birthday and planning to invite you? If so NTA. Just go and pretend it's your party and if anybody asks why you're making it about yourself just say you forgot because you didn't think people would host their birthday on your bithday", "NTA. I personally understand how important birthdays can be. However, they can set a birthday that day if they want to. Even if it does seem a little unfair to you. \n\nBut if you ever decide to have a birthday on their day for some reason, then they can't really say anything. What's good for the goose is good for the gander.", "They sent invites 2 months in advance? What are these plans?

Your friend has every reason to want to celebrate on the Saturday, and they don't owe it to you to move it.", "This is genius", "I noticed that there's no ages listed\n\nThis is a lesson for OP.

Fiend a new friend, a better one", "They\u2019ve moved out the city and now live a 1.5/2 hour commute away and the party is at their new place.

But I get you.", "Feel like if your birthday is on a Saturday that\u2019s an automatic save the date", "Wait then why is OP the AH, when it's the friend who planned a party without coordinating?", "Got an invite on a WhatsApp group with mutual friends. Would be happy to celebrate together if they\u2019d asked me before sending out the invites.

Better to have Sunday to recover from the hangover than go to work on Monday with one.\n\nMaybe they just didn't know OP's birthday and made plans solely on the knowledge of their birthday?\n\nIt doesn't matter the reason because the friends don't need to get permission before organizing a party.\n\nOP is an AH because they come off entitled feeling like they should have the right of first refusal for holding events on that Saturday.", "But now it can be a fun friendship contest! Neener neener, I have more!", " I saw that you said this friend had moved to a new town and was having their party in their new home. Have you considered how lonely your friend has been in her new town and maybe just maybe she wanted to share her birthday with friends and maybe she has not made that many in her new town yet....so this has nothing to do with you but someone looking to see friends. Why? Why is your birthday more important than theirs? Why would they put you before themselves or even think they owe you an explanation or consideration. Before you saw the invite did you give any consideration to this friend and how she would have trouble celebrating her B-day on a sunday and in a new town  if she wanted a party? Why are you more important? Please consider these questions and place yourself in another's place and try to come up with some reason they should give you more consideration then you give them. Time to meditate and breath deeply.  I do hope your B-day is happy and you discover life is good when you look for happiness and are kind to others.", "Are they their friends as well? They don't owe you a heads up. You don't own the day or your friends. Don't sound so entitled", "Are you saying that This person invited people who are your friends but whom they are not friends with?\nIf you and this other person are both friends with this group of people then you both have the right to invite them to your birthday parties and your birthday parties are the same exact weekend so you both could schedule the party on whatever day on that weekend that\u2019s probably why they Cynthia invitations out so early because they knew you could possibly be in Bayou or some other event .this is a first come first serve situation and they came first Schedule you\u2019re a good event for the Saturday before or the Saturday after . if you were close to this other person maybe you could have a birthday party together,  But if you ask them and they say no you have to except it and make other arrangements.", "Lol. No it doesn\u2019t. Sorry to be blunt but the world doesn\u2019t revolve around you. For most people that Saturday is just a Saturday.", "It don't work like that. It's not a wedding. They got their invites out first, now it's up to you to decide when you want your party to happen. The same day, the day after or the day before.", "I don\u2019t think that most people keep up with what day their friends birthday lands on that year and save the date ahead of time . But if your friends feel the same way you do then I guess you have nothing to worry about because they will have said that they can\u2019t attend that other party because theyve already saved that Saturday for you. If you are better friends with these people than the other person then you might wanna call them individually and tell them that you want to have your birthday on that Saturday and they will say no to the other party. Or just have your birthday the same Saturday and people will have to choose they might choose to go to yours because it\u2019s much closer.", "yeah definetly", "Because they never discussed coordinating before and by the sounds of it OP wasn\u2019t considering coordinating with her friends whose birthday is literally the next day. If her birthday was a month out and she planned it for OPs birthday, okay that\u2019s annoying and not very thoughtful but it\u2019s literally her birthday weekend too.", "Lol", "Depending on how good of friends they are, they could celebrate it together. I did that this year. One friend has birthday 11 days before me. Second one 4 days after me. So we just went ahead and combined them. Tho, we did celebrate after all three had already passed.", "For most people it\u2019s an ordinary Saturday but for friends a Saturday birthday is a reason to hang out and have a party", "This situation will happen throughout your life. You will learn to deal with it and get used to it. It\u2019s just life. \n\nTry to understand the YTA judgements. I always respect someone who does.
