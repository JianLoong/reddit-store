I have friends whose bdays are around mine including one who\u2019s the day after mine and we just message each other before planning a party and have often organized dual bday parties. Birthdays aren\u2019t a competition, no one should beat another to the punch. Especially if it\u2019s still months away, there was time to try to organize something together and have a long bdays weekend", "what does being the main character have to do with anything? if you're actually FRIENDS with someone why on earth would u not discuss something like this with them? \n\nu would honestly plan a party on someone you consider a friend's birthday? u wouldn't say hey wanna plan a party together? or have it on the friday since that's still the weekend without taking the spotlight off your friend? \n\nidk about you but i actually like my friends and want to celebrate their birthday and make sure they're doing what they want. in this situation i would 100% ask them if they wanted to plan something on saturday together OR plan something for friday night & then do something on the sunday too. \n\nif OP and the friend are more like acquaintances that's different, but if they're actual friends who hang out & text & share other friends & know about each others lives... that's strange to me.", "In comments OP says this person recently moved out of the city all the friends are in so it\u2019s a drive to get there. To me that explains why the invites went out early and why they choose the Saturday not Sunday, when people would have a long drive home and have to get up early on the Monday.", "\u201c[They\u201d can be used as a third-person singular pronoun, like \u201cShe\u201d and \u201cHe\u201d.](https://apastyle.apa.org/blog/singular-they#:~:text=The%20singular%20%E2%80%9Cthey%E2%80%9D%20is%20a,ze%E2%80%9D%20or%20%E2%80%9Chen.%E2%80%9D) Btw [historically it\u2019s been used in written language since 1375](https://www.scu.edu/media/offices/provost/writing-center/resources/Tips-Singular-Pronoun-They.pdf)", "How close of friends are you? \nI wouldn't organize my bday on the same day as my friend either we make a joint bday party or we discuss it and have it on different days.", "I mean, yeah it's frustrating. But it's also the way of the world. Honestly OP is just salty that they're not the main character in everyone's lives and didn't think to send out invitations earlier than their friend", "You're right, OP can still do their own thing and the mutual friends can choose, but that's going to be a bit awkward for those mutuals and I foresee a high chance of many \"sorry I'm already at a birthday party on that day\" responses. Sure, some may choose OP over the other friend, but many of those mutuals may be on the fence, and choosing the birthday thing that was planned prior that is them not actually having to 'choose between friends' and just going to the other birthday event they already agreed they'd go to.\n\nOPs best case scenario is them having a joint party", "Kalias offers the best advice.", "And if you drink sunday evening you will be fully sober on monday morning?\n\nThe only birthday partys on a sunday afternoon were of the elderly. Everyone else usually plans the party for a friday or saturday evening. If someones birthday is on a sunday usually the start is at saturday evening and you party into the birthday. In Germany it\u2018s called \u201ereinfeiern\u201c, no idea if it\u2018s usual anywhere else.", "Can you plan your party on Friday night? You guys could part into midnight to celebrate yours. I hope you end up having a nice birthday.", "Can you suggest doing a joint birthday party?\n\nPersonally I prefer those cause they are more fun and less pressure!", "u/satrdaybdayis_sacred\n\n2 months IS a heads up. Also, do you own your friends? Cause you sound like you think you own your friends. Cause I would think if your friend invited these people, they are also HIS friends as well.", "Don't lose a friend over something so trivial. You will go to a lot fewer parties.", "Unfriending a friend over something so trivial is a quick way to being seen as the problem and to stop being invited to things by others.\n\nDon't get me wrong, it kinda sucks for OP that their friend organised theirs first, but nobody is in the wrong here.", "OP didn't discuss about her birthday, nor has sent Anu invites. Or I havent seen anything saying like that. \n\nOP is not a friend then.\n\nWorld does not revolve around OP.", "INFO: Is this your best friend?\n\nAsking because I only have best friends' birthdays and family birthdays memorized. I would not think to consult all of my friends to make sure I wasn't taking their birthday day when setting up an event.", "Saturdays ARE NORMAL DAYS TO HAVE PARTYS.", "How about: talk to your friend and ask whether you can contribute and make it a dual birthday party? With double the budget for food and drink, it will be an awesome way to all get together and celebrate both of you.\n\nThen talk to her again next year etc. Maybe some years you'll pick different days, but you have the power to negotiate so that your parties are mutually awesome.\n\nYTA but you don't have to stay that way.", "That\u2019s not a reason not to try to plan a joined party from the get go. Not contacting OP to try to do something together at their new place but inviting them to your own bday bash on their birth date is a AH move", "Because it\u2019s an AH move to make your friends choose between who they want to hang out the most for a birthday. \n\nHosting a party on the Friday night would be a better solution, as long as it accommodates those who won\u2019t be able to drink alcohol due to the 2hr? Drive on Saturday for OP\u2019s friend party. OP could even hire a party bus or something.", "My partners bday is the day after mine and it's the best, double the celebrations and half the effort! More people, more fun, less social pressure.", "That would be an even bigger AH move. Straight up nasty.", "That\u2019s incredibly petty and shitty behaviour. Just celebrate on Sunday, it\u2019s not a big deal. Trying to ruin someone else\u2019s birthday party over this is as petty as it is pathetic.", "I would hold a party on Friday and get everyone really drunk so they didn't feel like partying too much on the Saturday.", "It\u2019s HIS actual birthday?! WTF is up with this comment section?!", "her birthday's 2 months away... i've never planned a birthday party 2 months before my birthday in my life... how is that being a bad friend not planning your birthday 2 months in advance?", "Okay, fair, I get that.\n\nMy friend once got married on my birthday. Because it was also her father's birthday and she wanted to honor him. I showed up, was happy for her and celebrated my birthday on a different day. We're still friends (but she's no longer married).", "Good point. I'm wondering if OP thinks his friends should never have other events on his birthday. Weddings? Baptisms? Funerals?

Did OP Make any effort to have a birthday party? Did ey sent invitations? Asked someone to organize something?", "So what. It's the day before his friends birthday.

Drunk driving & r*pe due to intoxication are some of the consequences of not taking it into account. \n\nAlso it\u2019s illegal to drive while intoxicated, so another solution could be suggesting a carpool/taxi to OP\u2019s friends place.\n\nOP can always plan for another weekend/Friday if they want to celebrate getting black out drunk.\nHowever, binge drinking can be deadly.", "To purposefully spite your friend and try to undermine their party.", "That's exactly what the friend did to OP, though\n\nNTA, make an obscene rager party on Friday, so everyone will be exhausted on Saturday \ud83d\ude01", "Then that friend should've taken that into consideration when they made the party.
