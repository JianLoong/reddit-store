{"id": 16855, "submission_id": "13dg8cg", "title": "AITA For Choosing To Celebrate My Sister's Birthday Instead Of My Dads Wedding?", "selftext": "I (27M) have always been close with my younger sister, Mary (20F). Mary has been overlooked by my dad from the moment she was born. My dad never wanted a daughter, and tensions with his ex wife (Mary's mom) lead to him basically excluding her from everything. Nothing she ever does is good enough for him and she is often excluded from family gatherings. I always try my best to include her or even take her out just the two of us to make her feel better, but it's obvious that being excluded hurts her a lot. I am my dads golden child and grew up spoiled and, while she tries not to show it, I can tell Mary is jealous of the attention my dad gives me.\n\nA month from now is Mary\u2019s 21st birthday and she\u2019s very excited about it. I live in a different state, but I made a promise to fly over on her birthday so that I could take her to get her first drink. We have been planning this for months and I already got the tickets.\n\nMy dad (56M) is currently engaged to Janice (57F), and a few days ago he texted me, letting me know that their wedding plans changed and they planned to get married in her parents yard on June 8th. He said he knew it was short notice but they agreed that a small ceremony would be better so they could go to the beach for their honeymoon while it was still nice. Now, my problem isn\u2019t the short notice, my problem is that June 8th just so happens to be Mary's birthday. Like not even a day before or later, no he plans to get married on his daughters birthday. I brought that up and my dad brushed it off saying it\u2019s just a date and it wasn\u2019t like my sister was going to celebrate her birthday with us anyways. I told my dad I already had plans to fly down and celebrate Mary's birthday with her and I wouldn\u2019t be able to make both events. He seemed shocked by this and asked why I didn\u2019t just cancel for his wedding since I\u2019m already paying to come down. I could even bring Mary along and celebrate her there if it meant that much to me.\n\nI\u2019ll admit, this pissed me off because the least he could do was acknowledge his daughter's birthday. I told my dad that I plan to spend my day with Mary and the only way I will come to his wedding is if she is invited and decides to go. He tried to argue with me, saying that birthdays come every year and weddings don\u2019t to which I responded that this is his third so it\u2019s not that special but my sister turning 21 is. My dad hasn\u2019t spoken to me since then, but Janice and other family have been calling and texting me nonstop. Janice told me that my dad has been crying and miserable over what I said and that my selfishness has ruined their wedding. I\u2019ll admit that what I said may be harsh but I also stand by it. I am not the one being selfish here and if my dad wants his child at his wedding so badly he can have all or nothing. However, my dad and family are still mad at me and saying that I\u2019m being petty and ruining his big day so, AITA?\n\nEDIT: Just want to clarify a few things here since I've been getting a lot of the same questions and I don't think I can respond to everyone.\n\nMary is in fact my dads biological daughter. There was never any suspicion of her mom cheating and from physical features alone it is obvious she is his. I don't know exactly why he hates her, we always just assumed it was something to do with her being a girl or my dad hating her mom. He divorced her not even a year after Mary was born and basically said he wanted nothing to do with either of them. I've tried asking my dad about this in the past but he refuses to talk about what happened.\n\nLet me also clarify that Mary and I only share the same dad. My dad has been married twice before Janice, the first being my mom and the second being Marys mom. My dad is a known womanizer which I believe is the reason his last two marriages didn't work out but I could be wrong. I don't really know Janice as they got together when I graduated college and I don't really care to know her. Unfortunately this also means I'm not sure what Janice knows about Mary or if she even knows that Mary exists but I am hesitant to ask.", "created_utc": 1683693120, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13dg8cg/aita_for_choosing_to_celebrate_my_sisters/", "score": 3752, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Moving your wedding last minute to the same date as your daughter\u2019s 21st birthday is just a shitty thing to do no matter how you look at it. As someone else said given your description of his prior history with Mary it wouldn\u2019t surprise me if he did this on purpose.                 \nLikewise the suggestion to bring Mary to the wedding and that you could \u201ccelebrate her there\u201d reeks of BS to me. I can almost guarantee if you do this and try to shift the focus to Mary and try to \u201ccelebrate her\u201d at any point during the day your dad would get upset and accuse you of  trying to make their wedding about Mary or some crap like that.          \nSo essentially my advice is to just stick to your plans with Mary. You only turn 21 once and it sounds like it\u2019s an important milestone for Mary that\u2019s she\u2019s been looking forward too. Don\u2019t go to the wedding regardless of if Mary can come or not because the way I see it Mary shouldn\u2019t have to spend her 21st birthday at her dad\u2019s wedding when it\u2019s clear he doesn\u2019t care about her anyway.

Therefore one hopes that you give the Charles the same leeway, as his son & wife.", "Yeah right...The other Windsor wives had it far worse. Not racism. Just nasty media outlets. Fine they left. Pity they can't leave his family alone but only seem to trash them in books & multiple documentaries.", "Rubbish. That's just made-up nonsense from fake news outlets. He didn't RSVP till April. No one knew whether he was even coming. They had to pay for renovations at Frogmore Cottage (Charles paid- let's tell the truth) after it came out that the taxpayers were funding the expensive renovations, just because they didn't want renovated apartments at Kensington Palace. Also How in the world was the Palace planning all this nonsense regarding the luncheon when they never did this for other grandkids? Lol. Like I said lots of nonsensical misinformation was around  before the Coronation. Pity some folk can't see the facts for what they are.", "You mean the four *children* and one sister who *all had formal roles in the coronation ceremony*? Wow. Straw plucking.", "I love how you spelled COWMILLA'S. \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23", "Do you only defend people who have done something for you? How sad...", "She doesn't seem to have any good family relationships with anyone. Her white family, her black family,  her ex-Trevor's family, Harry's family. After a while there's a common denominator in all these relationships and it's not the families.", "Don't understand the downvotes. Common sense statement.", "Considering to Harry that Charles publically humiliated his mother, divorced her, married his affair partner, and now his affair partner will be living a role that for all intents and purposes Charles took a vow would be for Diana.\n\n I'm sorry. I hate both Charles and Diana in that chapter, but I can't agree that someone who desecrated their vows at their wedding should then be allowed to essentially marry the country (which is what a coronation is, complete with a wedding ring) what's he going to do? Be married to the UK and then have an affair with France?", "\u201cSiri, set a reminder to have a drink for Mary on June 8th.\u201d\n\nOP, NTA but you are a kick ass brother. I hope your sister enjoys her birthday, I\u2019m sure she will with you by her side. Remember to block your family, at least for the day, so your relatives aren\u2019t harassing either of you about not being at the wedding. You both deserve peace and a happy visit with siblings.", "NTA\n\nI'm not a big birthday person but I will say that putting the wedding dare on your kids birthday is an asshole move. \n\nEither crash it with the sister or don't go. Fuck em.", "NTA\n\nHe did that on purpose.\n\nGolden child may need to go LC. I'd go NC.", "Buy her a couple around from me. NTA.", "NTA. Your dad did it on purpose. He's TA in this situation.", "Plus the fact that, from the way this is written, it sounds like she wasn't even invited to the wedding at all", "that's what gets me about lots of posts on RA and this sub?  who is and why are people just sharing that info to others?  my brother doesn't even have my number cause I didn't give it to him and family members that do have it would ask me first if it was ok to share.\n\nlike why would anyone beyond potentially mary need to have OP's number?", "I\u2019m with you, pouring a cold one on June 8th and cheers to OP\u2019s sister and OP for being a great sibling!", "yes!!  happy 21st, Mary!", "He has one daughter, OP is a guy.", "Oh I changed my opinion too when someone pointed out she's not invited to the wedding. He obviously wanted to make sure nobody celebrated his daughters 21st bday. I can't fathom being so cruel to your own child.", "Actually one of the reasons why they picked the date was because it was his birthday. But it wasn't considered negatively by them, but almost an auspicious date to choose because of it.", "I doubt something like a world event with world leaders is picked just to thwart a child's birthday. Come on.", "It's also his people's job to have forseen the media shit storm this was going to be.", "Don't forget: tampongate, spider letters, and just the whole Diana/Camila fiasco entirely", "He (and William) seem perpetually angry and petulant.", "No. Charles was 6 minutes early, W&C were on time as per the official schedule.", "So he's not working the family business and can't celebrate accomplishments by famy members in the business?\n\nI mean, all Charles did to get this job was outlive his mother.", "Yep, agree completely \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffe", "Like use of security, traffic patterns, road blocks, etc....", "A grandchild he has never even met.", "Modern day banking is almost entirely digital and requires very little real labor, bankers getting extra time off when they already do very little for an excessive wage is a travesty.\n\nSo long as essential services require money to be used the banks should be considered an essential service and mandated to be open 24/7.", "100% agree with this!", "Which one of them is considered a \"working royal\"? It's either limited to working royals or it isn't. You can't have it both ways.", "Dad scheduled his wedding for his daughter\u2019s 21st birthday then doesn\u2019t even invite her. Guess he\u2019s reaping his reward for that little stroke of cruelty.", "And then giving a toast at a coronation dinner \"to Archie, wherever you are.\" \n\nMy brother in Christ, he is *four*. He is at home! \n\nNTA, OP. Give your sister an amazing birthday celebration!", "OMG - find the caterer and add a Bday cake to the order", "They skipped the kids 3rd birthday to go to a polo game. They could have brought him, others did.", "That's not true. The government, church, and royal household had discussions as to which date it would be and they all finally agreed on this one. The government did not unilaterally decide.\n\nThe fact that it was Archie's birthday, as well as Margaret's wedding anniversary, actually made the date symbolic for them and were some of the reasons why they picked it.\n\nYou're also confusing Parliament with the government. Granted it is slightly confusing to most, and there is an overlap of some people, but they are two different things.", "Parliament/government, not confusing to me. As you wish let's be specific for social media and let's call it government. Ultimately the government has the last say on the date. Not the Church or the Monarch. The government is responsible for safety of the public, responsible for the Ministry of Defence (whose organisations take part -military etc), responsible for the Home Office (policing of the event etc) and the Ministry for Transport. There is no way the Church or the Monarch would pick a date unsuitable to the government and the government would have to agree. The other two are at the beck and call of the government. Therefore, Ultimately the government decides because they have the last say, as to what date the Coronation will occur.", "You do realise that Harry is Charles' son right? And that Archie is his grandson? I only say that because the idea of a man not mentioning his grandson's birthday (which he did btw, he gave him a toast) is absolute nuts. No way did he ignore his offspring. He maybe many things but Charles isn't a TOTAL monster.", ">Parliament/government, not confusing to me.\n\nClearly it is confusing to you, based on all your other comments on this post where you keep switching between the two.\n\nAll three groups, the church, government, and royal household, work together on choosing a date. The government doesn't have the final say. To be honest none of them do. It's a joint decision which they all negotiate on.\n\nFurthermore, any date could have been chosen. Even sometime next year. There is no set tradition for when a monarch should have a coronation in this country.\n\nI should point out that I'm a constitutional lawyer in the UK and you appear to frequent a Meghan hate subreddit, so I think trying to explain out the process to you may be a pointless endeavor.", "Didn't realise you're a social media noun police enforcer. If I knew I was being critiqued by a constitutional lawyer I'd have minded my ps and qs. \"A joint decision they negotiate on\"- that's your opinion. Ultimately if the government disagrees on a date, especially to do with the country's security the other two have to fall in line. Since you're here grandstanding about being a constitutional lawyer, I'll kindly add that I work for a government department that played a vital role towards the Coronation, but unlike you, I don't need to expunge my employment credentials to make myself feel and sound superior. I'll leave all that to you.\nI also really don't get where you're going with your 3rd paragraph unless you're trying to remind yourself regarding dates.\nAnd you had to go on my profile cause you're that sad. Unlike you, who appears to take social media oh so seriously, I follow reddit pages that amuse and make me laugh. Imagine judging someone by their choice of reddit pages. Lol. Thanks for making me laugh and making feel so special that your insecurities lead you to my profile.\nFinally, you must be a crap lawyer to judge someone by what social media pages they follow. You obviously take it all too seriously, unlike some of us who peruse through just for light entertainment. I'll bid you adieu and feel free to elucidate and enunciate further corrections, as it obviously makes you feel like the better human. Tah tah...", "Wow. Very believable.", "Lol whatever you say mate.", "Nta", "I would say if this isn't a giant neon sign to the future wife but honestly it sounds like she doesn't care (unless dad didn't tell her the truth) so screw both of them.", "I think you mixed up genders", "Wait, he did what? He really did that!?", "How the hell did this post devolve into being about the British royals???? Who cares, the monarchy should have been dissolved with George. Its a bunch of billionaires who leach off the country for billions of dollars annually. They haven't really served any purpose for years.\n\nOP is NTA. and his father sounds atrocious.", "And yet Charles could have said no. The coronation isn't going to happen on a day he isn't showing up. I can't believe that they couldn't find a different day in the past 8 months.\n\nAs a matter of fact, the Queen's own coronation was over a year after her father's death. It could have been another day.", "*\"Royalists*\" You mean glorifiers of violent western imperialism and let-them-eat cake wealth while essential workers fight for living wages in the UK? Let's not forget the condoning of anti-Black racism towards Megan Markle with a million justifications based on some repressive etiquette book. Oh yea and the part where the royal family treated Princess Diana like absolute shit.

He shouldn't even be getting crowned after the shit he pulled. The only reason he was next in line is because his mom's uncle had to abdicate to do what he got off scottfree for", "YES- you really should do this OP.

Wants to pressure son into going to wedding and since nothing he's saying is making any progress, he (fake) cries to his fianc\u00e9e, to his fianc\u00e9e's family, everyone he can fake cry to. He's also telling a twisted version of events. My best guess, \"Son is choosing to go party with sister for some reason instead of going to my wedding *sob sob sob*.\" And not, \"I planned my (3rd) wedding on my daughter's 21st birthday, refuse to invite her, and now I'm mad my son is spending the day with his sister and not me.\"\n6.
