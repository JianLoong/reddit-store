{"id": 16855, "submission_id": "13dg8cg", "title": "AITA For Choosing To Celebrate My Sister's Birthday Instead Of My Dads Wedding?", "selftext": " I (27M) have always been close with my younger sister, Mary (20F). Mary has been overlooked by my dad from the moment she was born. My dad never wanted a daughter, and tensions with his ex wife (Mary's mom) lead to him basically excluding her from everything. Nothing she ever does is good enough for him and she is often excluded from family gatherings. I always try my best to include her or even take her out just the two of us to make her feel better, but it's obvious that being excluded hurts her a lot. I am my dads golden child and grew up spoiled and, while she tries not to show it, I can tell Mary is jealous of the attention my dad gives me. \n\nA month from now is Mary\u2019s 21st birthday and she\u2019s very excited about it. I live in a different state, but I made a promise to fly over on her birthday so that I could take her to get her first drink. We have been planning this for months and I already got the tickets.\n\nMy dad (56M) is currently engaged to Janice (57F), and a few days ago he texted me, letting me know that their wedding plans changed and they planned to get married in her parents yard on June 8th. He said he knew it was short notice but they agreed that a small ceremony would be better so they could go to the beach for their honeymoon while it was still nice. Now, my problem isn\u2019t the short notice, my problem is that June 8th just so happens to be Mary's birthday. Like not even a day before or later, no he plans to get married on his daughters birthday. I brought that up and my dad brushed it off saying it\u2019s just a date and it wasn\u2019t like my sister was going to celebrate her birthday with us anyways. I told my dad I already had plans to fly down and celebrate Mary's birthday with her and I wouldn\u2019t be able to make both events. He seemed shocked by this and asked why I didn\u2019t just cancel for his wedding since I\u2019m already paying to come down. I could even bring Mary along and celebrate her there if it meant that much to me. \n\nI\u2019ll admit, this pissed me off because the least he could do was acknowledge his daughter's birthday. I told my dad that I plan to spend my day with Mary and the only way I will come to his wedding is if she is invited and decides to go. He tried to argue with me, saying that birthdays come every year and weddings don\u2019t to which I responded that this is his third so it\u2019s not that special but my sister turning 21 is. My dad hasn\u2019t spoken to me since then, but Janice and other family have been calling and texting me nonstop. Janice told me that my dad has been crying and miserable over what I said and that my selfishness has ruined their wedding. I\u2019ll admit that what I said may be harsh but I also stand by it. I am not the one being selfish here and if my dad wants his child at his wedding so badly he can have all or nothing. However, my dad and family are still mad at me and saying that I\u2019m being petty and ruining his big day so, AITA?", "created_utc": 1683693120, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13dg8cg/aita_for_choosing_to_celebrate_my_sisters/", "score": 107, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I would bet every penny I have that your dad did this intentionally. Fuck him. The only valid reason to go to his wedding is to crash it with mary and make a scene (not that I'm suggesting this)", "NTA. What goes around comes around and her 21st is a huge milestone- it says way more about your dad that his wedding was scheduled to conflict with it", "NTA. He knows exactly what he's doing.", "NTA pick your sister she deserves at least one family member who cares about her. Your dad can have janice and keep crying.", "NTA. Moving your wedding last minute to the same date as your daughter\u2019s 21st birthday is just a shitty thing to do no matter how you look at it. As someone else said given your description of his prior history with Mary it wouldn\u2019t surprise me if he did this on purpose.                 \nLikewise the suggestion to bring Mary to the wedding and that you could \u201ccelebrate her there\u201d reeks of BS to me. I can almost guarantee if you do this and try to shift the focus to Mary and try to \u201ccelebrate her\u201d at any point during the day your dad would get upset and accuse you of  trying to make their wedding about Mary or some crap like that.          \nSo essentially my advice is to just stick to your plans with Mary. You only turn 21 once and it sounds like it\u2019s an important milestone for Mary that\u2019s she\u2019s been looking forward too. Don\u2019t go to the wedding regardless of if Mary can come or not because the way I see it Mary shouldn\u2019t have to spend her 21st birthday at her dad\u2019s wedding when it\u2019s clear he doesn\u2019t care about her anyway.

If not having his kids there is really 'ruining' his big day, you would think he would have picked a day other than his daughter's 21st birthday, that both his kids already had plans for. Do you realize that he didn't even *invite* his daughter to his wedding? And you are calling *me* petty?\"\n\nNTA. Good for you for being a supportive influence on your sister, despite your father's awful behavior (not to mention the apparent complicity of all of his family members).", "NTA - go enjoy mary\u2019s bday.", "NTA.

Do not subject your sister to that wedding should your dad invite her.  She will be treated poorly and your dad will be resentful at being given the ultimatum.   Your father is on his 3rd marraige.  ATP he needs to go to the court house.  And Janice is so upset.  She should look at his track record and think twice if she has any sense.  \n\nPlease spend the day with your sister.  Turn your phone off and tell your dad there are 29 other days in June.  If he wants you at the wedding he needs to change the date.
