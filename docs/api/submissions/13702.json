He repeatedly told me he loved me and I was his priority and that he would show me. But he never did show me.

He even had the gall to ask me if I'd be a babysitter for them and thought \"us\" spending time with his new kids would be the way for him to make up for being there for someone else's kid. Also, I know she's not his bio kid because she's a different race to him and his wife.\n\nAn example is when I had stopped caring and just treated him with respect he promised me a day of us time, where he'd buy me stuff I had wanted for a while and treat me to food of my choice. The day before he realized his stepdaughter's birthday celebration was the same day and hers was at a special sensory place for kids with needs like hers, and he had a sick toddler at home. He told me we'd need to do it another day because he needed to take his stepdaughter, then he suggested we could both go and we'd still get our time. I told him she has a mom who could do it. He said she couldn't take the sick kid. I asked about a babysitter and he told me he couldn't leave his sick toddler with a stranger.

I told him he was doing it yet again and expecting me to accommodate his family and that no, I would not change the date, that I always knew he wouldn't actually show up so I didn't even invite him. He told me he WOULD come if I changed the day and he swore all kinds of ways that he would make it. I told him I did not believe him.

As a dad, is was going to sightly side with him, but then I remembered my wife and her siblings come a far second, to her dad's step kids. So much so that now she only sees him once or twice a year, and he only lives less than a 1/4 of a mile away.\n\nYour dad is the one missing out.", "NTA. Period.\n\nFirst, people argue about quantity of time versus quality of time with kids. They say, if we can\u2019t have quantity, at least we can have quality. The \u201cmake up day\u201d was supposed to be about making up for time lost. But the truth is that without quantity, it\u2019s actually hard to have quality time. Because it\u2019s in the everyday presence and showing up for the mundane regular things that make the quality time real. Parents who think that they can just spend quality time with their kids are missing the fact that it\u2019s the simple, mundane, everyday stuff that also really really matters. You can\u2019t quality time yourself out of missing the everyday.  Additionally, people think that older kids need less time. It\u2019s not true. They need different time. But, OP, your Dad couldn\u2019t even do that for you. He couldn\u2019t see that you needed him and he definitely didn\u2019t show up for you on either a daily basis or for agreed upon (bullshit IMHO) \u201cmake up\u201d days. Oof. \n\nSecond, this isn\u2019t about him. He is making it, once again, about him and his family. You are supposed to somehow bend yourself to their needs? How fucking self centered is that!?! You are separate and distinct from him. You didn\u2019t invite him initially because you were self protecting the disappointment that you were gong to have because there is always something that takes more precedence than you. Yes, you could offer to switch time time on the day, so he can be present for both. You could offer to switch the date. Or you could offer to go out to a lunch with him and possibly his family at a different time to celebrate. But he is making his presence at your shower about him. His attendance at a shower isn\u2019t the important thing. It\u2019s about the celebration of parenthood, the expectation of what\u2019s to come, the support we provide to one another. That can actually happen at any time. But for some reason it\u2019s a big deal for your dad to attend the actual shower? Why? So everyone can know that he shows up once and a while? Nope. This isn\u2019t about him, it\u2019s about you. People can walk and chew gum at the same time. He can be present for his other daughter\u2019s surgery and show respect in lots of ways. Here is how it could look like: \u201cOP, I\u2019m so sorry I can\u2019t attend your shower. XX has a surgery and I need to be with her. But we want to celebrate with you. Can we have you and partner over for dinner or go out to lunch and have a mini-family shower for you? Can we provide food or something for the shower, even if we can\u2019t be there due to the surgery? \u201c  instead your hearing, change the date so I can be publicly preset for you. Ugh. \n\nAnd finally, fuck the noise from his wife. He\u2019s showing up all the time for her kids. She just gaslight you with no compassion for what you\u2019ve experienced and what you\u2019ve lost. No walking in your shoes. This is the result of reaping what you sow, but she can\u2019t even comprehend what she and he have sown in your life. \n\nOnce again, NTA. I hope your pregnancy unfolds with ease.

Just *one* more opportunity and if you would just give them that one more opportunity then you and the whole world would suddenly see the miracle that is their true divine nature?  That it would just radiate from them throughout the this earth and unto all the heavens, bringing peace on earth, and cats and dogs living together in harmony?

He was being a father to her while married to my mom and pretending we were his only family. She was his priority.\n\nI guess I'm confused. It sounds like there's way more to the story. If he was pretending you guys were his only family, then how did you even know he was spending more time with her than with you while he was still married to your mom? Affairs are typically done in secret and the spouse/kids know nothing about it. Did you and your mom know about the affair while it was happening? If you did, then he wasn't pretending. Unless you mean you found out after the fact. You have it phrased as if you knew it was happening *while* it was happening, but if that's the case, then it wasn't a secret and he wasn't pretending. Unless he didn't know you knew, I suppose. \n\n>It wasn't her actual birthday that day, it was just the day they could book the place before her actual birthday.\n \nThis explains the scheduling conflict. I was wondering how he didn't realize he planned to spend time with you on the stepdaughter's birthday. It makes sense that he didn't realize because the event was planned around when they could get the venue booked. Most people's birthdays are celebrated on weekends or around when venues are available, so that makes sense. \n\n>She came first BEFORE she was a stepdaughter and she came first after and then I ended up below her and four other kids he had with his wife, when he admits it was already impossible to make time for me because of the dynamic.\n\nLike I said, I think therapy is a good idea. If she is always prioritized first over you, than I understand your frustration. The example you gave just doesn't show that because that situation was understandable. A surgery is also understandable. If he called and said his stepdaughter wanted to go shopping that day so he couldn't make it, that would be completely different. That would be a clear indicator she is prioritized over you. \n\nParents with multiple children do this all the time. They prioritize their children equally, but situations *do* determine which child is getting time with the parent or what the outcome of a conflict is going to be. If a child requires more medical attention then the other two children of the family, then sometimes, those medical issues are going to take priority no matter what else going on. If it's a special occasion, that takes priority as well. There's many examples, but overall, each child should be prioritized equally.\n\nAn issue that happens with blended families is that, a lot of times, a parent is working with limited time to be able to spend with the kids they don't primarily live with. If someone sees their kid every other weekend while also living with their other kids, it's easy for the kid they don't live with to feel like they are prioritized last because, as a result of the living situation, the parent is already spending more time with the kids they live with. It's just pure math. You throw in situations that life throws your way and it can be difficult to spend quality time with the kids you don't live with. It isn't that they are prioritized last; it's just a product of the circumstances. \n\nWith that being said, there are definitely parents who don't make an effort. Unfortunately, there are *a lot* of deadbeat parents out there. Most of them don't even attempt to even pretend to try to see their children though, so whenever a parent is actually making attempts, it's wise to look at the situation objectively to gage if the attempts are genuine or not.", "> Her older sister told me that she'd sit outside on the days he was going to visit and just wait and wait for hours because she never lost hope that he'd come.
