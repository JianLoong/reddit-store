He married the affair partner then. During the affair he did a lot of stuff for his affair partner's daughter. I was angry and his argument always was she was severely disabled and had no dad and he was trying to be good. I was always angry at him for that. He repeatedly told me he loved me and I was his priority and that he would show me. But he never did show me. Promises were made, and attempts happened, but I always knew I'd come last when up against his stepdaughter or the kids he had with his wife. He even had the gall to ask me if I'd be a babysitter for them and thought \"us\" spending time with his new kids would be the way for him to make up for being there for someone else's kid. Also, I know she's not his bio kid because she's a different race to him and his wife.\n\nAn example is when I had stopped caring and just treated him with respect he promised me a day of us time, where he'd buy me stuff I had wanted for a while and treat me to food of my choice. The day before he realized his stepdaughter's birthday celebration was the same day and hers was at a special sensory place for kids with needs like hers, and he had a sick toddler at home. He told me we'd need to do it another day because he needed to take his stepdaughter, then he suggested we could both go and we'd still get our time. I told him she has a mom who could do it. He said she couldn't take the sick kid. I asked about a babysitter and he told me he couldn't leave his sick toddler with a stranger. I told him he couldn't honestly expect his day of making up to me to be counted if it was celebrating his stepdaughter. He looked so hurt and said but she's my sister. I said she wasn't and even if she was, his always putting her and the other kids first would always be a big deal.\n\nHe has always told me he would make up for hurting my feelings but never has. Now I'm 25, married and with a baby on the way. My baby shower is in a few weeks and dad heard about the shower and called to say he wanted to come but it was the same day of his youngest daughter's tonsillectomy and could I change the date so he could be there. I laughed over the phone and asked if he was serious. He said of course. He wants to be there for me. I told him he was doing it yet again and expecting me to accommodate his family and that no, I would not change the date, that I always knew he wouldn't actually show up so I didn't even invite him. He told me he WOULD come if I changed the day and he swore all kinds of ways that he would make it. I told him I did not believe him. His wife called after and told me I have always been unfair and should have accepted he wasn't just my dad. She told me her daughter deserved to have a father too and I'm selfish, etc. She said I could at least give him this chance.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1680340785, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/128gt6l/aita_for_not_changing_the_date_of_my_baby_shower/", "score": 79, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The reason I ask if I might be the asshole is because he called as soon as he heard about it and told me he wanted to be there and asked me to pick another date. In theory I could do this by like a day or even a week to see if he would show up.

Believe him. \n\nSorry you had to go through this. Focus on yourself and being the best mom and partner you can be and don't let him and his consistently self-centered choices drag you down. You're under no obligation to make any accommodation for him or his chosen family, ever.", "NTA tbh even if you had intentionally picked the shower date to be on the date he had a prior appointment as a way of subtly hinting that you didn't want him to be there you still  wouldn't be the asshole.\n\nIt seems you and your dad have not had a good relationship these years, so it's a question if you even wanted him to be there even if he were free and if that would be comfortable for you.", "NTA. As a dad, is was going to sightly side with him, but then I remembered my wife and her siblings come a far second, to her dad's step kids. So much so that now she only sees him once or twice a year, and he only lives less than a 1/4 of a mile away.\n\nYour dad is the one missing out.", "NTA. Period.\n\nFirst, people argue about quantity of time versus quality of time with kids. They say, if we can\u2019t have quantity, at least we can have quality. The \u201cmake up day\u201d was supposed to be about making up for time lost. But the truth is that without quantity, it\u2019s actually hard to have quality time. Because it\u2019s in the everyday presence and showing up for the mundane regular things that make the quality time real. Parents who think that they can just spend quality time with their kids are missing the fact that it\u2019s the simple, mundane, everyday stuff that also really really matters. You can\u2019t quality time yourself out of missing the everyday.  Additionally, people think that older kids need less time. It\u2019s not true. They need different time. But, OP, your Dad couldn\u2019t even do that for you. He couldn\u2019t see that you needed him and he definitely didn\u2019t show up for you on either a daily basis or for agreed upon (bullshit IMHO) \u201cmake up\u201d days. Oof. \n\nSecond, this isn\u2019t about him. He is making it, once again, about him and his family. You are supposed to somehow bend yourself to their needs? How fucking self centered is that!?! You are separate and distinct from him. You didn\u2019t invite him initially because you were self protecting the disappointment that you were gong to have because there is always something that takes more precedence than you. Yes, you could offer to switch time time on the day, so he can be present for both. You could offer to switch the date. Or you could offer to go out to a lunch with him and possibly his family at a different time to celebrate. But he is making his presence at your shower about him. His attendance at a shower isn\u2019t the important thing. It\u2019s about the celebration of parenthood, the expectation of what\u2019s to come, the support we provide to one another. That can actually happen at any time. But for some reason it\u2019s a big deal for your dad to attend the actual shower? Why? So everyone can know that he shows up once and a while? Nope. This isn\u2019t about him, it\u2019s about you. People can walk and chew gum at the same time. He can be present for his other daughter\u2019s surgery and show respect in lots of ways. Here is how it could look like: \u201cOP, I\u2019m so sorry I can\u2019t attend your shower. XX has a surgery and I need to be with her. But we want to celebrate with you. Can we have you and partner over for dinner or go out to lunch and have a mini-family shower for you? Can we provide food or something for the shower, even if we can\u2019t be there due to the surgery? \u201c  instead your hearing, change the date so I can be publicly preset for you. Ugh. \n\nAnd finally, fuck the noise from his wife. He\u2019s showing up all the time for her kids. She just gaslight you with no compassion for what you\u2019ve experienced and what you\u2019ve lost. No walking in your shoes. This is the result of reaping what you sow, but she can\u2019t even comprehend what she and he have sown in your life. \n\nOnce again, NTA. I hope your pregnancy unfolds with ease. Congrats.", "NTA but your answer to his wife is \"I've given him multiple chances, thats why I know he'll let me down no matter what I do, so I'll do what works for me without counting on him to minimize the damage he can do to me.\"", "NTA\n1.  men are often not at baby showers.  \n2. He wasn't  invited\n3. changing the date if an event already planned is ridiculous.  \n4. The wife has a lot of nerve \n5. Go on with your shower and your life \n6.

If you didn't go off at her with receipts from alllll the way back and her absolute lack of any moral high ground from which to lecture you, I salute you for having rock-solid self control.\n\nNTA. He's shown you who his priorities are, and you don't deserve that kind of neglect.", "NTA. He wasn\u2019t even invited and is already making demands you accommodate him.", "NTA.  Did you ever notice how AH always crap all over you for months, years, decades even, and then when they want to feel better about themselves tell you the *least* you could do is give them one more chance?  Isn't it amazing that they just always need *one* more opportunity to show what kind, gentle, loving spirits they are? Just *one* more opportunity and if you would just give them that one more opportunity then you and the whole world would suddenly see the miracle that is their true divine nature?  That it would just radiate from them throughout the this earth and unto all the heavens, bringing peace on earth, and cats and dogs living together in harmony?  But since you won't give them just *one* more opportunity, well, I guess you are just unfair.\n\nSeriously, those people are absolute trash.

Daddy needs to know that that ship sailed long ago.", "We will. One of the questions I asked when we discussed our future if he wanted to be a parent and he said yeah he wanted kids.

That changed for him at some point with other kids but he might have wanted me at some point but he clearly didn't want to be my parent.", "That was what bothered me when they had kids together. He couldn't make me a priority because he was so wrapped up in his stepdaughter, but then he adds more, and not just one or two, they have four kids together. I've heard him complain a lot about not enough hours in the day and how bad he felt when he could only do 10 minutes with each kid... guess which kid didn't even get those 10 minutes. He'd always promise to try though. After a while it got more annoying than if he didn't say anything.", "I honestly never expected him to show.

Rain, cold, burning heat, she'd sit on the curb waiting for him. \n\nI remember in our early 20s, he'd say he was going to come hang out. 22 years old, she'd wait at the curb. We waited with her. Her eyes would light up with every headlight that drove by, and then sadness when they didn't stop. \n\nMy friend struggled with severe anxiety and fear of abandonment because of that man. \n\n\nFinally she let go of the hope, and in doing so let go of him entirely - because that's the only link they had - her hope that he'd do better. He wasn't at her wedding. Her grandfather who raised her gave her away. He's not invited to family functions, he's a stranger. \n\n\nIt feels like you're there and let me tell you - for my friend that decision was the moment her life turned around. And no one misses that dude because he was never there in the first place. \n\n\nYou're doing it right. Why would you reschedule something for someone who wasn't invited in the first place? You didn't invite him because without asking, you knew he'd be busy! Because he always has been in the past. And what a surprise,  you were right! \n\n\nYou're doing him a favor, he obviously can't handle the number of kids he already has,  so you're making his life easier by removing yourself and your child from the equation."]}
