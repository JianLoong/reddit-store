He repeatedly told me he loved me and I was his priority and that he would show me. But he never did show me.

He even had the gall to ask me if I'd be a babysitter for them and thought \"us\" spending time with his new kids would be the way for him to make up for being there for someone else's kid. Also, I know she's not his bio kid because she's a different race to him and his wife.\n\nAn example is when I had stopped caring and just treated him with respect he promised me a day of us time, where he'd buy me stuff I had wanted for a while and treat me to food of my choice. The day before he realized his stepdaughter's birthday celebration was the same day and hers was at a special sensory place for kids with needs like hers, and he had a sick toddler at home. He told me we'd need to do it another day because he needed to take his stepdaughter, then he suggested we could both go and we'd still get our time. I told him she has a mom who could do it. He said she couldn't take the sick kid. I asked about a babysitter and he told me he couldn't leave his sick toddler with a stranger. I told him he couldn't honestly expect his day of making up to me to be counted if it was celebrating his stepdaughter. He looked so hurt and said but she's my sister.

I told him he was doing it yet again and expecting me to accommodate his family and that no, I would not change the date, that I always knew he wouldn't actually show up so I didn't even invite him. He told me he WOULD come if I changed the day and he swore all kinds of ways that he would make it. I told him I did not believe him.

As a dad, is was going to sightly side with him, but then I remembered my wife and her siblings come a far second, to her dad's step kids. So much so that now she only sees him once or twice a year, and he only lives less than a 1/4 of a mile away.\n\nYour dad is the one missing out.", "NTA. Period.\n\nFirst, people argue about quantity of time versus quality of time with kids. They say, if we can\u2019t have quantity, at least we can have quality. The \u201cmake up day\u201d was supposed to be about making up for time lost. But the truth is that without quantity, it\u2019s actually hard to have quality time. Because it\u2019s in the everyday presence and showing up for the mundane regular things that make the quality time real. Parents who think that they can just spend quality time with their kids are missing the fact that it\u2019s the simple, mundane, everyday stuff that also really really matters. You can\u2019t quality time yourself out of missing the everyday.  Additionally, people think that older kids need less time. It\u2019s not true. They need different time. But, OP, your Dad couldn\u2019t even do that for you. He couldn\u2019t see that you needed him and he definitely didn\u2019t show up for you on either a daily basis or for agreed upon (bullshit IMHO) \u201cmake up\u201d days. Oof. \n\nSecond, this isn\u2019t about him. He is making it, once again, about him and his family. You are supposed to somehow bend yourself to their needs? How fucking self centered is that!?! You are separate and distinct from him. You didn\u2019t invite him initially because you were self protecting the disappointment that you were gong to have because there is always something that takes more precedence than you. Yes, you could offer to switch time time on the day, so he can be present for both. You could offer to switch the date. Or you could offer to go out to a lunch with him and possibly his family at a different time to celebrate. But he is making his presence at your shower about him. His attendance at a shower isn\u2019t the important thing. It\u2019s about the celebration of parenthood, the expectation of what\u2019s to come, the support we provide to one another. That can actually happen at any time. But for some reason it\u2019s a big deal for your dad to attend the actual shower? Why? So everyone can know that he shows up once and a while? Nope. This isn\u2019t about him, it\u2019s about you. People can walk and chew gum at the same time. He can be present for his other daughter\u2019s surgery and show respect in lots of ways. Here is how it could look like: \u201cOP, I\u2019m so sorry I can\u2019t attend your shower. XX has a surgery and I need to be with her. But we want to celebrate with you. Can we have you and partner over for dinner or go out to lunch and have a mini-family shower for you? Can we provide food or something for the shower, even if we can\u2019t be there due to the surgery? \u201c  instead your hearing, change the date so I can be publicly preset for you. Ugh. \n\nAnd finally, fuck the noise from his wife. He\u2019s showing up all the time for her kids. She just gaslight you with no compassion for what you\u2019ve experienced and what you\u2019ve lost. No walking in your shoes. This is the result of reaping what you sow, but she can\u2019t even comprehend what she and he have sown in your life. \n\nOnce again, NTA. I hope your pregnancy unfolds with ease.

Just *one* more opportunity and if you would just give them that one more opportunity then you and the whole world would suddenly see the miracle that is their true divine nature?  That it would just radiate from them throughout the this earth and unto all the heavens, bringing peace on earth, and cats and dogs living together in harmony?

He wants you to change the date of an event he is not even invited to.\n\nIf you have no expectations of your father he can't disappoint you. Don't change the date of your baby shower and have him let you down again. Expect nothing of him and he won't disappoint you. You deserve better and the failure is his not yours. NTA.", "Perfect response. It's not about being \"just your dad\" , it's about his persistent failure to accommodate your needs while expecting you to accommodate the needs of his new family. NTA", "NTA\n\nHe got his chances.\nA lot of them. He blew every single one of them.", "IMO you shouldn\u2019t change the date. He\u2019ll just disappoint you again. As for the affair wife I don\u2019t think she has any right to butt into this at all. Block her from your phone and all social media. You don\u2019t need her input at all. NTA", "NTA, actions speak louder than words. Your dad has given you nothing but excuses.", "NTA.  The next excuse would be that a new episode of her favorite cartoon is coming on and they need to be there to watch it as a family.", "NTA\n\nObviously your dad's a huge asshole, but I'm just as shocked by the audacity of his wife. The nerve of that woman to call you and try to make you feel bad after she broke up YOUR family. \"Her daughter deserves to have a father too\" well your mom deserved to have a husband who's not a cheating ass and you deserve an actual dad who's thete for you, but here we are", "op=NTA \n\nfor not changing date 1) you didn't invite him 2) he has a pattern of not showing up.\n\nYou carry a lot of anger and bitterness-which seems justified.  However, I worry how it affects you(not him).  Do what you need to find peace within yourself.  You will soon have a beautiful child that you don't want to have experience your pain.  \n\nYou also need to come up with a plan, will you allow him in your daughter's life, if he can be there consistently?  Or will you refuse him access.  \n\nWife has not taken on any responsibility for ensuring your father spent time with you or that he stick to his agreements.  So her wants/needs/feelings are not your concern.\n\nPlus most surgeries happen in the morning, so he couldn't stop by in the evening for at least a short time while her mother sits with her in recovery/in her room?", "NTA. However, how come you don\u2019t just go full NC with them? Why entertain their nonsense? You have always been an after thought to him. He replaced you with new children. You are just tormenting yourself by having him in your life. I hope you make the choice of just cutting all ties and forget you ever had a father. He has never been there for you and never will. He will do the same to your children as a grandfather of you give him that chance.  Run girl, run.", "Is it a thing to host your own baby shower now?", "Your #1 was my first question too: Why would any dude who\u2019s not the baby\u2019s father WANT to go to a baby shower? Spending an entire afternoon pretending to be excited about onesies and diaper caddies? Sounds about as exciting as a colonoscopy.\n\nAnd it\u2019s particularly weird considering what little interest OP\u2019s dad has shown in participating in any other part of her life. Makes me wonder if this wasn\u2019t just a calculated attempt on his part to assert some kind of dominance, demonstrate that even though he and his daughter are quasi-estranged, he can still bend her to his whims. (And he probably wouldn\u2019t have shown up even if she HAD changed the date.)\n\nOP is NTA.", "I'm always astounded by the guff a homewrecker would have to make comments on \"family\".", "I would have called her a home wrecker and hung up. The audcatiy to fuck up a whole family, and then harass the child of your now husband.  What a shitty human being.", "Changing the date isn't going to make him come and you've seen that most of your life. This sounds like his MO and his wife jumping to guilt you too sounds pretty routine. You have all these other people in your life who love and support you and they're really looking forward to spoiling you and that baby at your shower so stick to the plan.\n(Edited because I can't spell lol)", "That is a really good point. To say to his wife 'i care so much but she wouldn't change the date' have wife yell at OP. Father looks like he cares. OP made to be bad guy. Sounds self serving.", "Then go NC and block him everywhere.", "Oh my, but the wife takes the fucking cake.", "Sounds unfair to every kid in that situation", "In a way yes and no. My birth mother is an addict and they were already separated by the time he met my stepmother. But he didn\u2019t initiate the actual divorce until after he met her"]}
