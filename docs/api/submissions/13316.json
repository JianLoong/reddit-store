My mum and dad split when I was 4. At this point I lived with my mum, and my dad would come visit for an hour or two every few weeks for us to hang out.  \n\nMy dad was ~49 when this happened. He has the idea that by default he has some level of authority over me (despite being absent a lot), even if I am right, and would shut down an argument because I was younger than him (I guess that\u2019s not too uncommon for older people to do).\n\nMy dad was visiting, like he normally does, and we were chilling in my room. I wanted to show him something I had been working on on my PC, so I was loading it up for him to see. I can\u2019t remember what exactly happened, but the context isn\u2019t important, all I remember was it was a petty thing that blew out of proportion (I think it was something to do with the pc).\n\nMy dad was CONVINCED he was right, and I was trying to explain to him that he wasn\u2019t. For the record, I\u2019m autistic and terrified of conflict, so I rarely, if ever, raise my voice. My dad started getting more and more annoyed at me for using a \u2018sarcastic tone\u2019. I was remaining calm, and told him that he was the one getting angry, which only mad him angrier. I also tried to say that I was not intending to be sarcastic. He started going red and then basically lost it. He yelled at me saying I was being disrespectful to him and was giving him attitude. At this point, I was feeling extremely attacked for no reason and was kind of embarrassed at how he was acting.\n\nHe got so angry he looked like he was going to hit me, I doubt he would\u2019ve, but at the time I was seriously thinking it. I remember feeling kind of frozen, as I suddenly realised that my dad was really screaming at me like he never had before. \n\nThen, he stormed out of my room, went upstairs to my mum and into her room (which I think is completely disrespectful to her), and called me a \u2018little shit\u2019, then proceeded to leave the house and drive away. \n\nMy older brother and mother, to my surprise, didn\u2019t fully side with me. They said that I can be so annoying and irritating that it brings out the worst in people. That hurt me honestly, as I never intend to be like that and try and be kind. They treated this like it wasn\u2019t a big deal. I didn\u2019t purposefully make him angry, I was just giving him a reasonable answer to his irrational yelling. I know it might sound like I was na\u00efvely being a know-it-all, but I was just trying to stay calm because raising my own voice would make everything worse, and I wasn\u2019t going to be silent because I had respect for myself and wouldn\u2019t let this grown man yell at me, I used to have to put up with a verbally abusive stepdad (who left when I was around 13 after cheating).\n\nAt this point I lost respect for my dad, and it completely messed me up for a few days. He sent a \u2018sorry for losing my temper\u2019 text after a few hours and never brought it up again. He hasn\u2019t really felt like my dad ever since this happened.

So the only choice he had is to leave. He is an adult and a father first of all and his choice of words and name calling is disgusting.  \n\n\n Also even if you mom doesn't agree with your point of view saying that \" you can be so annoying you bring up the worst in people\" is immature and cruel.   \n\n\nI'm sorry that you found yourself in such a toxic situation. Don't let him off the hook just because he said \"sorry\". Maybe try to have a conversation with him and explain that you felt terrified and hurt. I even think over text would be better so you will not be as scared and have some time to collect your thoughts.", "NTA - In every child\u2019s life comes the moment when they become an adult. By remaining calm and rational in response to your dad\u2019s tantrum, you entered your adulthood. You were not at fault. It\u2019s likely your dad has had anger issues all his life (possibly a result of his own upbringing). He yells, he apologizes. It\u2019s sad that this has created a distance in your heart for him, but it\u2019s understandable. In any case, let this one life moment go. No need to go over it any longer. It\u2019s in your past. Continue moving forward.", "INFO: context is essential in this situation in order to understand what happened truthfully and then pass a fair and unbiased judgement. What was the whole situation OP?\n\nETA: shouting at someone else, moreover a child, is never right, especially losing your temper like how you describe your father did. But we\u2019re not here to judge him in this situation (although he was an AH), you\u2019ve asked for judgement on your behaviour so we need to know the whole context to be able to give you that.", "NTA.\n\nYour dad is an asshole.", "*CLEARER CONTEXT*\n(Sorry if I wasn\u2019t clear enough about the context, hopefully this should clear things up a bit)\n\nThe issue that started the argument was about something silly and trivial, like a setting on the PC if I remember correctly.\n\nHe was adamant that he was right and that something was a certain way, and I was trying to explain to him that he wasn\u2019t correct but not far off. He then said that he was definitely right, and when I once again tried correcting him he began to get more frustrated.\n\nIn my 15 year old brain I began to feel disrespected, so I didn\u2019t back down and just let him have this, because I knew that I was correct in this situation and didn\u2019t want to misinform.

A grown man should never scream at a teenager no matter how 'annoying' they are. I don't care if you were calling him a drooling moron to his face, you didn't cause that. your mom and brother are wrong and shitty to blame you/your ASD for his behavior.", "NTA something incredibly common for us autistic people is that we dont have control over our tone of voice, besides the fact off course that we are different (different not better or worse than others) and express ourselves differently\n\nThe amount of times ive been told i sounded snappy when i was actually either just saying something without any specific kind of emotion behind it or was actually in an upbeat mood cant be counted on 2 hands and its an actual ableist problem autistic folks are forced to deal with\n\nIts NEVER ok to scream like that at your kid, especially not over a perceived tone\n\nSounds like from your other comments aswell that your family isnt supportive of you and at times downright ableist (discriminatory to disabled people)", "You are NTA OP. Anyone who says they can't control their temper is full of shit; they don't want to out in the work.\nMy father was a hardcore alcoholic and smoker. But he was still an incredible father. Do I wish I hadn't had to see that? Absolutely. But in 27 years I can't remember him once raising his voice with my sister or I, never once were we afraid of him. And we did plenty to piss him off. Fucks sake I flooded his newly renovated basement and he just took a good breath, hugged me and told me it was ok, mistakes happen and we'll fix it.

I couldn\u2019t sleep and was scared to see him after that. Just feels like some \u2018friend\u2019 I have that had a tantrum. I know I shouldn\u2019t wish for it and it\u2019s better to accept the way things are, but I do wish I my mum and dad were together in a unit.

In your shoes, I would steer clear of him and set very clear boundaries about what behaviour you find acceptable from him. Something like: \u201cHey dad. You really scared me when you acted like that and I didn\u2019t like it. I\u2019d like to have a relationship with you but only if we can respect each other and I feel safe around you.

If I\u2019ve done something to upset you, let\u2019s have a calm and rational discussion about it so that we can both seek to understand each other and learn moving forwards. However, if you yell at me or become physically aggressive or intimidating, then I will exit the discussion and cut contact with you until you can control your anger as I don\u2019t feel safe or comfortable around you when you act like that.\u201d", "Oh my GOD I'm the same way and it drives people insane.. like I'm sorry I really am, I'm not trying to sound rude but I'm pretty sure I just heard you say, for example, that there are only 2 sexes, which most people who have like.. a high school level of biology can tell you is wrong? Therea XX and XY of course, but you can get all sorts of combinations ( XXY, XYY, XXXX, XXXY, YY, etc. Etc.) And in the animal kingdom it gets even MORE complicated.. \nI've gotten a bit better at being gentle about correcting it, but Jesus christ is is hard sometimes with people who should know better."]}
