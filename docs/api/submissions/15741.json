I was relaxed but my one strict rule was no guests. Nothing personal, just don\u2019t want random kids in my house. But he\u2019s allowed to hang out with them in the backyard or anywhere else so long as he\u2019s back by 11pm and he stays out of trouble.\n\nIt was going well for the first couple of days but I caught a girl sneaking out at 4 in the morning which gave me a heart attack. I let them both have it and told my nephew if this happened again then we\u2019ll have to revisit the rules if he isn\u2019t mature enough to handle them.\n\nNot even a week later, it\u2019s around 1am and I\u2019m chilling in my room. I\u2019m usually asleep by this time but I had a day off work. I heard giggling and just knew that he had a girl in the house. \n\nI decided to embarrass him because scolding/yelling wasn\u2019t working. I stood outside his door, knocked real loud and yelled \u201cI forgot to tell you, but your anime cosplay costume came in. It\u2019s in the basement if you want to try it on!\u201d \n\nNow I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything wrong with anime or cosplaying. But my nephew and the type of people he hangs out with do not like it. \n\nI heard the girl laugh before my nephew ran to the door, unlocked it and began going \u201cwtf r u taking about.\u201d I gave him a look, he rolled his eyes and I told him the girl has to leave. Side note... it was a whole other girl. She was laughing the whole time.\n\nShe finally left and my nephew started yelling at me for embarrassing him. He said that if I ruined his social life he\u2019d hate me forever. I told him not to disrespect me then and said he should be glad I didn\u2019t embarrass him even more. He said that it would\u2019ve been better if I just yelled at them and I reminded him of the last time which shut him up. \n\nI then told him that either way, the girl clearly knew I was joking but I\u2019d actually order a costume just for him next time if he brings another girl over. He went fuck you then ran to his room.\n\nIt\u2019s been a few days and he hasn\u2019t had any girls over and instead hangs out in the backyard with his friends. I feel like it might\u2019ve worked but he\u2019s still upset about the joke. He told me that the girl told her friend group and now like 5 girls think he\u2019s an anime cosplayer. I told him that they\u2018re just teasing him but he insists I\u2019ve ruined his rep.

NTA.\n\n\nAnd it doesn't sound like his social life was \"ruined\".  Maybe with the girls but more likely it sounds like they found out he has a revolving door of ladies at the house.", "NTA - he didn\u2019t listen the first time so embarrassment will work.\n\nYour better than me I would have sent him back to his parents.\n\nHe\u2019s needs to stop acting like he\u2019s you roommate and not your nephew.\n\nAlso with the way he talked to you I would have banned all friends coming over altogether.\n\nWhat a brat.", "NTA.  Looks like he ended up on the \"find out\" side of \"F\\*\\*\\* around and find out\" and didn't like it.  But he learned.\n\nAlso, you embarrassed him in front of one person who shouldn't have been there in the first place. You didn't embarrass him in public, like making him wear cosplay to school or something.  He should be thanking his lucky stars you didn't decide to get even more creative.", "NTA - But maybe you should buy a Sailor Moon costume just in case.", "NTA - I think this officially makes you a parent.", "NTA, he will get over it and laugh one day.", "NTA - I think this falls under play stupid games, win stupid prizes", "NTA - You found an effective way to get him to understand the rules. Break them and there are consequences.", "NTA - everyone has currency or something that they value. You can punish young children by saying no desert but teens don't respond to that so you have continually adapt, taking cellphones away, embarrassment, etc.", "NTA - well if it isn\u2019t the consequences of my own actions.\n\nDon\u2019t feel bad. This is literally nothing", "NTA, your house your rules. end of story.", "NTA.  If there was a cosplay for a drama queen, Id buy it for him lol.\n\nYour house, your rules, he had been told once and ignored it, maybe this time it will sink in.", "NTA.\n\nWish I had an award to give, that is one awesome story! \n\nIf yelling doesn\u2019t work, you find something that does. You did. Just awesome!", "NTA. Welcome to being a parent.", "NTA. Effective!", "NTA- That is aunt's job 100%. Sounds like he's a player with different girls and using them. .... that's the yikes part..

Way to be creative.\n\nOh, the teenage ego. So fragile.", "NTA - if it happens again get a Pokemon cosplay for you and go to his room in it.
