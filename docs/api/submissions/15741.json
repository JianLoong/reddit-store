I was relaxed but my one strict rule was no guests. Nothing personal, just don\u2019t want random kids in my house. But he\u2019s allowed to hang out with them in the backyard or anywhere else so long as he\u2019s back by 11pm and he stays out of trouble.\n\nIt was going well for the first couple of days but I caught a girl sneaking out at 4 in the morning which gave me a heart attack. I let them both have it and told my nephew if this happened again then we\u2019ll have to revisit the rules if he isn\u2019t mature enough to handle them.\n\nNot even a week later, it\u2019s around 1am and I\u2019m chilling in my room. I\u2019m usually asleep by this time but I had a day off work. I heard giggling and just knew that he had a girl in the house. \n\nI decided to embarrass him because scolding/yelling wasn\u2019t working. I stood outside his door, knocked real loud and yelled \u201cI forgot to tell you, but your anime cosplay costume came in. It\u2019s in the basement if you want to try it on!\u201d \n\nNow I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything wrong with anime or cosplaying. But my nephew and the type of people he hangs out with do not like it. \n\nI heard the girl laugh before my nephew ran to the door, unlocked it and began going \u201cwtf r u taking about.\u201d I gave him a look, he rolled his eyes and I told him the girl has to leave. Side note... it was a whole other girl. She was laughing the whole time.\n\nShe finally left and my nephew started yelling at me for embarrassing him. He said that if I ruined his social life he\u2019d hate me forever. I told him not to disrespect me then and said he should be glad I didn\u2019t embarrass him even more. He said that it would\u2019ve been better if I just yelled at them and I reminded him of the last time which shut him up. \n\nI then told him that either way, the girl clearly knew I was joking but I\u2019d actually order a costume just for him next time if he brings another girl over. He went fuck you then ran to his room.\n\nIt\u2019s been a few days and he hasn\u2019t had any girls over and instead hangs out in the backyard with his friends. I feel like it might\u2019ve worked but he\u2019s still upset about the joke. He told me that the girl told her friend group and now like 5 girls think he\u2019s an anime cosplayer. I told him that they\u2018re just teasing him but he insists I\u2019ve ruined his rep. Idk, I don\u2019t have kids and I do feel a little bad.\n\nEdit:\n\nLots of suggestions which, while they do sound funny in theory, would definitely ruin his social life. Will not be doing any of those if anyone\u2019s concerned\u2014I think he\u2019s learned his lesson and he\u2019s still just a teenage boy... no need to ruin his life for real.", "created_utc": 1682523542, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12zlnil/aita_for_embarrassing_my_nephew_and_ruining_his/", "score": 707, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Sending your kid away for a couple weeks is a little harsh. Is he acting up because he's always coming in second to a sick sibling? Does he need therapy? 17 year olds are going to act up at points, they're teenagers. Sneaking two different girls when you said no is asshole, but expected because he's 17.

He violated them, twice. He should consider himself lucky.", "Again, I knew these questions would come up so I explicitly stated that her health issues started after he started misbehaving.
