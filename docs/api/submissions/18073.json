{"id": 18073, "submission_id": "13ql14u", "title": "AITA for smoking weed with my grandpa?", "selftext": "Last week, I (23M) was over at my grandparents house. My grandpa (69M) is a very cool guy. He is always laid-back, chill, very open minded, and always has amazing stories to tell. He doesn\u2019t smoke cigarettes, but he does smoke weed on occasion (like once a month). However, he has high blood pressure and asthma. Other than that, he\u2019s a healthy guy who exercises weekly. \n\nI started smoking weed when I was in high school, and my parents did know but they didn\u2019t mind as long as I did it in moderation, as long as I was honest with them, and as long as i knew the health risks. They also know that my grandpa smokes, and they have expressed their concerns about this especially since it\u2019s not recommended for people with asthma, and they want him to stop. I personally think it\u2019s not a big deal as he knows what he\u2019s doing and it\u2019s his own decision.\n\nAnyways back to last week; My grandpa has never smoked with me before and he really wanted to do it with me sometime, so we met up last week, spent some time in the woods behind my grandparents house together, smoked a bit, and then went back to their house. It was a really funny experience. My grandma knew what we were doing and she doesn\u2019t mind, she\u2019s very open minded as well. \n\nShe brought it up with my parents however, and my dad called me and started an argument about it. He says that i\u2019m encouraging him by smoking with him and that i should be more concerned for his health. I said that my grandpa was the one who initiated it, but he told me that i should\u2019ve said no. \n\nI feel like i am TA because i didn\u2019t listen to my parents (because i knew they were concerned) and because i\u2019m not helping my grandpa quit smoking.

You didn\u2019t force him and he didn\u2019t force you.", "Totally NTA,  this is a great memory for future you, please don't let dad harsh your buzz. Grandpa is a grown man that has been making decisions on his own for decades and the choice to smoke with you was between him grandma and you.", "NTA\n\nYour grandpa is a grown ass man who can think for himself. You clearly didnt start his habit. Does he smoke by himself?", "NTA!\n\nWhat an awesome experience you got to have! Perhaps remind your dad that grandpa is his parent, not his child. I\u2019m pretty jealous tbh because my gma wants to smoke and I haven\u2019t been able to try it with her yet!", "NTA. Your grandpa is an adult and can make his own decisions. If he wants to smoke, he can smoke. As long as he knows the risks, he can do what he wants. You smoking with him wasn't encouraging him, you weren't forcing him to smoke and it was also only one time. I'd say you were the asshole if it was like a frequent thing, but one time isn't hurting anyone.", "NTA. At 69 years old, Grandpa is very much an adult and more than capable of making his own decisions.", "You are an adult, engaging in a legal activity in the company of another adult.\n\nYes, there are health risks associated with smoking. You are both adults - you get to make your own choices. It's not something I'd do, but that's OK. \n\nNTA", "NTA.  If you parents have a problem, then can take it up with grandpa himself instead of putting you in the middle.  And grandpa is old enough to make his own decisions.", "NTA. Your grandpa is 69 years old. He can make his own adult decisions. Sounds like you two had a great time and it doesn\u2019t sound like this is going to be a regular thing.", "NTA\n\nI understand your parents' concern, but that something they should take up with your grandpa, not you. He can make his own decisions, and so can you.", "Definitely NTA. Grandpa was going to smoke regardless, with or without you. He\u2019s a grown ass man. Just because your parents don\u2019t like him smoking, doesn\u2019t mean they need to respect his decisions any less.", "NTA. \n\nI understand your parents concerns, BUT they can\u2019t make decisions for him. He is a grown man and their elder. It\u2019s his life and they have no right to tell him how to live it even if they disagree with his choices. This is not a case of addiction that\u2019s affecting the family, and he likely knows his own limits. Your parents need to realize this and step back because it\u2019s not their place", "NAH. You and your grandfather are both adults and capable of making your own choices; on the flip side your parents are right to be concerned for the health of a 69 year old asthmatic.\n\nThere are ways to enjoy marijuana with your grandfather in a safe manner, like edibles, should you wish to repeat this experience. As a bonus, you can do edibles indoors because there\u2019s no smoke to linger or stink up the place.", "NTA. Grandpa is old enough to make his own decisions. I\u2019m 60 and smoke it too. I too was recently diagnosed with mild asthma. Have had high blood pressure for years but it\u2019s managed through medication. I have switched to vaping dry herb but I still smoke on occasion. You don\u2019t suddenly turn into an idiot in your 60s. He knows what he\u2019s doing and the risks, I\u2019m sure. Your family is ridiculous", "nta, and your dad is a moron. Cannabis is a bronchial AND vasodilator that effectively treats both conditions.", "NTA. He might not be able to make a fun memory such as this anymore tomorrow so I feel like your grandpa took that into consideration.", "NTA your grandpa just wants to smoke some and relax. Better than having him in a zombie like state with half a dozen dangerous prescription opioids.", "You're not an asshole but you should look out for your grandpa's health. Why not try an edible next time you want to get high with him. At the end of the day he's a grown man that made his own choice.", "Your granddad smoking anything while he has asthma is just insane.  Smoke, and you're delusional if you think weed smoke isn't harmful, is extremely harmful to asthmatics.\n\nSure grandpa is an adult and can make his own choices but that doesn't mean you ignore the bad habits especially one that are absolutely harmful to his health.  \n\nYTA for acting like its no big deal.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Your parents might not support this choice, but it is ultimately for him to decide. It is possible that he prefers the memories to a longer life. It might be that he wants to \"cheat\" once in a while and it helps him keep to his regimen the rest of the month. You did good by respecting his autonomy as a person.", "NTA. \n\nUnless your grandfather is experiencing some kind of cognitive disfunction, your father should stop treating him like a child.", "NTA, both you and your grandfather are grown ass men. your grandpa isn\u2019t \u201ca smoker\u201d from what you\u2019ve told us, he only does it occasionally. so, as 2 grown ass men who don\u2019t smoke regularly, it is not your responsibility to make your grandpa quit anything. \n\nthe biggest a-holes in this story are your parents for trying to control a grown man and making something out of nothing.", "NTA - A 23 year old is not going to encourage a grandparent to keep doing what they are doing.

You're not. \n\nBut you might want to have a convo with him, ask him if he'd ever tried edibles? I guess they take longer to kick in, but wouldn't impact his lungs. Ask him what he thinks.

Weed is bad for his high blood pressure and smoking is bad for asthma, although the use of marijuana has shown to improve lung capacity.\n\nYou and your grandpa had a bonding moment, sharing a memory.\n\nAnd your parents are just worried for his health because time is running out to spend with Grandpa.\n\nNo one is the asshole here.", "Grandpa is 69 (nice!) and can still make his own decisions.

Also, OP stated they knew of the risks, they didn\u2019t say it was completely safe and not harmful at all.. But I feel where we highly disagree is that you view this as a bad habit. That mentality is so way off base to me. Smoking anything is harmful no matter if you have asthma or not, but a least there actually are benefits to cannabis, so the blanket statement that it\u2019s a bad habit doesn\u2019t really stand. Ever medication has its side effects and TBH, most meds that people get prescribed to have a WAY higher risk factor than cannabis.", "Reefer Madness!", "I suggested edibles to my gma but she\u2019s scared of them! LOL.", "If the guy wants to get high, get him edibles.  \n\nThere's no way anyone should ignore the massive and obvious problem of asthmatic + smoke in a person.  As someone who is asthmatic I know that you can't just take a couple of puffs of your rescue inhaler and be OK next time when you are regularly exposing yourself to your asthma triggers by choice.  Every time he smokes it makes the problem worse.  He is reducing his lung capacity which affects his blood oxygen levels.  At 69, grandpa is already considered in a high risk health category, add on asthma and he would clearly be considered immunocompromised.  It doesn't take much to send someone to the hospital in that situation.\n\nGet him edibles.  Get him to stop smoking.", "NTA.\nIt sounds amazing that you can share something mind broadening with your grandpa.\nIf your family has an issue with it because of health concerns, just get some edibles, a bong, or a vaporizer next time!", "\"grandpa displays autonomy over his own body\" \n\nEveryone with a control complex :\n\n\"HOW DARE HE DAIN TO HAVE CONTROL OVER HIS OWN ACTIONS\" \n\nYour parents are assholes", "Or just let a grown-ass man make his own decisions.

And his young friend gives him a disapproving look.\n\nThe man with the cigar says \"Allow an old man his pleasures.

He knows it's not very good for him, he's old enough to know. Both of my kids were able to spend a good amount of time with my dad before he passed.

He's allowed to do dumbass things that negatively affect his own health and there's no reason to believe that you somehow nagged him into it.", "Weed smoke and asthma is a weird thing.\n\nThere are certainly bad elements, but as someone with Asthma, I used to drop the ole \"it's a pretty much instantaneous bronchodilator\" on anyone giving me grief, and legitimately it often helps me breathe better if my airways are closing up. Now buckling is a problem and that's the downside but for an experienced smoker it can be a huge relief when the ASSthma (got em) comes to town.\n\nNTA. \n\nGramps sounds cool.", "Or invest in a volcano vaporizer.
