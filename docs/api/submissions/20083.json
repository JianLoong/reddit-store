{"id": 20083, "submission_id": "14dom84", "title": "WIBTA if I didn't go to my brother's wedding?", "selftext": "My (32F) brother (28M) just proposed to his girlfriend (22F) of six months. They set the date for the date that they met, which is December 13. It will be 5-6 that night.\n\nI have two problems with this. Number one, I live three hours away and am a teacher. I get one personal day a year. Not only is their wedding smack in the middle of finals for my district, it would require me to use all my personal PTO to attend due to the travel time involved. I would have to split it between the 13th and the 14th. My family is demanding that I come, but I don't think it's fair to demand that I give up my one thing for my brother and I will tell you why.\n\nMy boyfriend of three years bought a house when we met. He changed factory jobs last year to one with a more supportive work environment with more opportunities for advancement. However, his company is currently experiencing an unexpected slow season due to the economy, and there is not enough work for everyone at the moment. He barely makes enough money to cover expenses, and this has been the case for a few months. I am moving in with him over the summer to help with bills going forward and have been giving him whatever money I can spare. I was hopeful for an engagement ring and/or wedding for next year, but some other financial setbacks associated with homeownership (new gutters, having to replace appliances that don't work, etc) have almost completely diminished those hopes.\n\nNow to my brother. My brother has, in the three weeks since proposing, been repeatedly rude to me about his engagement. He makes remarks about me being a spinster, how he could get someone to marry him in six months when I can't get someone to commit in three years and this makes him a superior person, how I am too mentally ill to be a good spouse (I have ADHD and depression), I am not successful like my brother is so why would anyone marry me, etc. Meanwhile he and our parents are telling me that I have obligations for their wedding (I was a florist for a few years so I need to make the center pieces and the bouquets free of charge; I have run a small business making custom jewelry for fifteen years, so I have to make the jewelry for the bridal party; I have to be our elderly grandfather's chauffeur; I am expected to come early and set up; I am expected to stay late and clean up; I am expected to be a server and do dishes during the reception).\n\nI think I am well within my rights to demand some things change, given my brother's attitude. Namely, the bullying regarding my marital status (or lack thereof) and the demands they are placing on me when they purposefully picked a day that few people could attend. I think they are demanding too much of me when they simply expect me to do things and won't even ask if I can make it all work. Since it's finals, I might not even be able to take it off in the first place.\n\nSo... I think I know the answer, but I could use some insight. Would I be the asshole if I did not attend my brother's wedding?", "created_utc": 1687204043, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14dom84/wibta_if_i_didnt_go_to_my_brothers_wedding/", "score": 278, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I do not get families that demand over asking for a favor, but those are not good people.

However that being said, it could affect your relationship with him and possibly with your other extended family, so that's something you have to consider but if you're cool with the possible consequences than that's fine.  It does not make you a jerk.  He has been mean to you and in connection to \"marriage\".  You are feeling like he's rubbing it in your face, so I can understand why you wouldn't want to go.

NTA.\nThere seems to be a whole host of reasons why going to your brother's wedding is a bad idea and, other than 'he's family' and to keep the peace, no good ones for you. \nIf people have a mid-week wedding, it's to be expected that not everyone can go. It feels like they only want you to go for the things you can offer to keep their costs down. A wedding should be a joyous occasion for everyone and your brother sounds like he's being pretty mean; denigrating you, your relationship and, by extension, your partner. It wouldn't make me want to go!", "so NTA.  do not go to that wedding.", "What are you, Cinderella? The only thing that arguably makes you an asshole is your apparent wish to both skip your brother's wedding (right decision) *and* continue to cling to the abusive relationship you are enmeshed in with your family of origin. Screw these people! They are awful to you! Let them go and focus on the healthier relationships in your life. They have you confused about how you deserve to be treated. You are an adult with your own life. They don't get to make demands on you.", "NTA.\n\nYour family isn't even planning on having you as a guest.  They plan on you working through the event as well as before and after it.\n\nThey picked an inconvenient date and the consequences of that are that not everyone can attend, including some family.\n\nYou take care of yourself and let them find some people to hire.  Yes, they will have to pay them but that is part of having a wedding.", "Your brother sounds like a piece of work. Getting engaged after 6 months doesn\u2019t mean anything when you compare it to 3 years of a successful relationship. Unless they started living together when they first started dating, it takes longer than 6 months to fully get to know someone. Your relationship is also none of his business, so if you guys aren\u2019t engaged yet, that\u2019s your business not his. \n\nI will say, if you love your brother and you don\u2019t go to the wedding, just be prepared for the remainder of your lives to be different and potentially no contact. If that doesn\u2019t bother you though, I wouldn\u2019t go. Like I said, he sounds like a real piece of work and probably has some insecurity issues he\u2019s putting on you which is both disrespectful and degrading to you. \n\nAlso who cares how much money he makes? In my opinion, gloating about your money is the lowest personality trait one can have.\n\nNTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

He just feels that it should be one \"I deserve.\" He also wants to be more financially stable before we get married so that, should children come, he is capable of being the sole provider for all of us. Noble intentions, but yeah. He kinda needs to put a ring on it. He says it's coming, and I know he's been looking. His mother told me he showed her what he's thinking about getting me. Based on what I know, it's around $1k. I used to work for Kay Jewelers, so I know the monthly payment plan on a $1k ring is around $40-60 a month. Right at the moment, though, that $40 payment is what he usually has leftover after his bills. I have been buying his groceries for him for the last month.\n\nYes, I am moving into the house my boyfriend owns. He doesn't want me to pay any more than the increase in bills from me living there (so maybe $300 a month), but I insisted on paying him more to give him some breathing room financially. Like I said, he changed jobs, expecting this company to be more stable and supportive than his last, based on what people in our area had to say about the company. It is a major local employer. He bought the house when he was making $5 an hour more than he is now and only changed jobs when he figured he could support himself on what they promised him he would be working each week. The company hasn't even been able to get him 40 hours a week for the last two months.  It is unusual for their slow season to be this long. People who have been there for 15-20 years have said as much. Nobody could really predict this kind of thing happening. If things don't improve in the next few months, in what should be their busy season, he will be looking for another job. I'll just be there to support him.", "They met and had their first date on December 13, 2022, so they want to get married on December 13, 2023.", "I am currently expected to help set up and then stay late to clean up.

For OP, it's an unpaid obligation for which she isn't treated as family or friend. She's their wedding slave.  \n\nWe need to dispense with the idea that no ask is too great or absurd when it is in service to \"family.\" A lot of abusive behavior is ignored or accepted as immutable fact because it's wrong or rude to upset the family. \n\nOne of the best parts of being an adult is getting to make your own family, and biology does not get an automatic place in your life.", "Why do you think a wedding after one year of knowing each other is going to be a once in a lifetime event?", "Why would she take time off to honor her bully?", "She gets one day off a year and it\u2019s during a time when the time off request will likely be denied anyway.

This might not be the once in a lifetime event you think it will be.", "Considering OPs brothers fiance is only 22 years old, they've been dating only 6 months, and current divorce rates... I would argue this isn't necessarily a once in a lifetime event.", "Why? These people don\u2019t respect you. They only see you as someone to use for what you can offer them. If you don\u2019t cook, clean, serve, drive, and provide free goods, they wouldn\u2019t even bother inviting you. Why are you wasting time & energy on people who are very clear they think very little of you and don\u2019t respect you at all?", "Just don\u2019t! DO NOT GO! There\u2019s nothing n it for you except bullying and spending a lot of money you can\u2019t afford. Your family sucks!", "Oh boy. You are probably a super lovely friend, but the downside is that your patience has you acting like a doormat. I\u2019m even surprised that you\u2019re actually considering standing up for yourself (and I\u2019m so proud of you!). \n\nHowever. \n\n(1) Brother and parents can piss off with the demands. It is 100% your right not to go, even if your brother wasn\u2019t a jackass. (My sister didn\u2019t attend my wedding because the travel and time off wasn\u2019t feasible. I was sad not to see her but it was NOT a major issue. It was my wedding not hers. She\u2019s celebrated many an anniversary with us since!). \n\nIf you feel like it, send a gift. And block them for a while if they\u2019re stressing you out, till they calm down. \n\n(2) But I worry a bit about you beyond your family. Supporting your boyfriend is great, but (and I\u2019m thinking about that doormat thing again) careful you\u2019re not taken advantage of. It\u2019s \u201chis\u201d house and you\u2019re paying extra on the bills? Nothing wrong with this for a time, obv, but be sure to check in with yourself about it regularly.

You can go there & be used & abused as an indenture servant. Running family members around, paying for all the flowers, all the bridal gifts, be nothing more than the waitstaff & dishwasher as the rest of your family enjoys the reception while never even noticing your absence while you wash dishes in the kitchen. You can still give him his expensive wedding gifts on top of all that and he will still demean you & disrespect you while your parents nod along. You could have a million dollars to spend on him but you\u2019ll never buy his respect.", "Don't spend your pto on that. It's not worth it. You're a teacher you've got to save thay stuff for emergency and things that really matter. \n\nIt seems to me they just want to use you to save a few bucks. I'd lean more towards going if you actually knew and liked the bride and, especially, if your brother wasn't being an AH and needed the help, but based on what you said he seems to think he's well off enough.\n\nIf your family doesn't like your reason you're not going then sucks for them. They wouldn't like being bullied and still expected to contribute.", "There is no try. Only do or do not. Be unequivocal. \"I am not going to be able to attend or provide the flowers and jewelry. Good luck!\"", "Yeah, it's sounds like he rushed into a proposal just to hold it over OP's head. I get that some relationships can work that well, but rushing into marriage after being together less than a year almost never works out. Not being engaged after 3 years isn't a bad thing. In fact, it's a good sign that they're taking the time to get to know each other properly and making sure they're compatible before committing to each other forever (at least, that's what marriage is supposed to be).", "And she\u2019s 22.

His got the house when he was making $5 more an hour, but his workplace was hostile, unstable, and no room for promotions. He switched to this company after hearing from a TON of people how good it was. Then their slow season hit... And it hasn't left. People who have been there for 15-20 years have said repeatedly they have never seen it last this long. My BF had saved up money for the 3 months he knew things would be slow, but it hasn't picked up at all. He wanted me to move in and basically pay the increase in bills, but I insisted on more. He's had maybe $40 a week for gas and groceries for a couple of months now. That's just how slow his work is at the moment. He hates taking help from anyone, too, so when I pay a bill for him now, he wants to pay it back. If I live with him and pay a bill, he'll be more accepting of it.", "Oh go away with that crap.
