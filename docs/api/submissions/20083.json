{"id": 20083, "submission_id": "14dom84", "title": "WIBTA if I didn't go to my brother's wedding?", "selftext": "My (32F) brother (28M) just proposed to his girlfriend (22F) of six months. They set the date for the date that they met, which is December 13. It will be 5-6 that night.\n\nI have two problems with this. Number one, I live three hours away and am a teacher. I get one personal day a year. Not only is their wedding smack in the middle of finals for my district, it would require me to use all my personal PTO to attend due to the travel time involved. I would have to split it between the 13th and the 14th. My family is demanding that I come, but I don't think it's fair to demand that I give up my one thing for my brother and I will tell you why.\n\nMy boyfriend of three years bought a house when we met. He changed factory jobs last year to one with a more supportive work environment with more opportunities for advancement. However, his company is currently experiencing an unexpected slow season due to the economy, and there is not enough work for everyone at the moment. He barely makes enough money to cover expenses, and this has been the case for a few months. I am moving in with him over the summer to help with bills going forward and have been giving him whatever money I can spare. I was hopeful for an engagement ring and/or wedding for next year, but some other financial setbacks associated with homeownership (new gutters, having to replace appliances that don't work, etc) have almost completely diminished those hopes.\n\nNow to my brother. My brother has, in the three weeks since proposing, been repeatedly rude to me about his engagement. He makes remarks about me being a spinster, how he could get someone to marry him in six months when I can't get someone to commit in three years and this makes him a superior person, how I am too mentally ill to be a good spouse (I have ADHD and depression), I am not successful like my brother is so why would anyone marry me, etc. Meanwhile he and our parents are telling me that I have obligations for their wedding (I was a florist for a few years so I need to make the center pieces and the bouquets free of charge; I have run a small business making custom jewelry for fifteen years, so I have to make the jewelry for the bridal party; I have to be our elderly grandfather's chauffeur; I am expected to come early and set up; I am expected to stay late and clean up; I am expected to be a server and do dishes during the reception).\n\nI think I am well within my rights to demand some things change, given my brother's attitude. Namely, the bullying regarding my marital status (or lack thereof) and the demands they are placing on me when they purposefully picked a day that few people could attend. I think they are demanding too much of me when they simply expect me to do things and won't even ask if I can make it all work. Since it's finals, I might not even be able to take it off in the first place.\n\nSo... I think I know the answer, but I could use some insight. Would I be the asshole if I did not attend my brother's wedding?", "created_utc": 1687204043, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14dom84/wibta_if_i_didnt_go_to_my_brothers_wedding/", "score": 1227, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Each couple has its own dynamic, hence works on its own timeframe!", "NTA, You do not need to attend the wedding if you don't want to, and you definitely do not need to to carter to them either.  I do not get families that demand over asking for a favor, but those are not good people.

However that being said, it could affect your relationship with him and possibly with your other extended family, so that's something you have to consider but if you're cool with the possible consequences than that's fine.  It does not make you a jerk.  He has been mean to you and in connection to \"marriage\".  You are feeling like he's rubbing it in your face, so I can understand why you wouldn't want to go.

They\u2019re trying to force you to do thousands of dollars of work for free lol", "Going to your brother's wedding sounds such an attractive proposition for you! NTA.\nThere seems to be a whole host of reasons why going to your brother's wedding is a bad idea and, other than 'he's family' and to keep the peace, no good ones for you. \nIf people have a mid-week wedding, it's to be expected that not everyone can go. It feels like they only want you to go for the things you can offer to keep their costs down. A wedding should be a joyous occasion for everyone and your brother sounds like he's being pretty mean; denigrating you, your relationship and, by extension, your partner. It wouldn't make me want to go!", "so NTA.  do not go to that wedding.", "What are you, Cinderella? The only thing that arguably makes you an asshole is your apparent wish to both skip your brother's wedding (right decision) *and* continue to cling to the abusive relationship you are enmeshed in with your family of origin. Screw these people! They are awful to you! Let them go and focus on the healthier relationships in your life. They have you confused about how you deserve to be treated. You are an adult with your own life. They don't get to make demands on you.", "NTA.\n\nYour family isn't even planning on having you as a guest.  They plan on you working through the event as well as before and after it.\n\nThey picked an inconvenient date and the consequences of that are that not everyone can attend, including some family.\n\nYou take care of yourself and let them find some people to hire.  Yes, they will have to pay them but that is part of having a wedding.", "Your brother sounds like a piece of work. Getting engaged after 6 months doesn\u2019t mean anything when you compare it to 3 years of a successful relationship. Unless they started living together when they first started dating, it takes longer than 6 months to fully get to know someone. Your relationship is also none of his business, so if you guys aren\u2019t engaged yet, that\u2019s your business not his. \n\nI will say, if you love your brother and you don\u2019t go to the wedding, just be prepared for the remainder of your lives to be different and potentially no contact. If that doesn\u2019t bother you though, I wouldn\u2019t go. Like I said, he sounds like a real piece of work and probably has some insecurity issues he\u2019s putting on you which is both disrespectful and degrading to you. \n\nAlso who cares how much money he makes? In my opinion, gloating about your money is the lowest personality trait one can have.\n\nNTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
