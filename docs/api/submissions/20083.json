{"id": 20083, "submission_id": "14dom84", "title": "WIBTA if I didn't go to my brother's wedding?", "selftext": "My (32F) brother (28M) just proposed to his girlfriend (22F) of six months. They set the date for the date that they met, which is December 13. It will be 5-6 that night.\n\nI have two problems with this. Number one, I live three hours away and am a teacher. I get one personal day a year. Not only is their wedding smack in the middle of finals for my district, it would require me to use all my personal PTO to attend due to the travel time involved. I would have to split it between the 13th and the 14th. My family is demanding that I come, but I don't think it's fair to demand that I give up my one thing for my brother and I will tell you why.\n\nMy boyfriend of three years bought a house when we met. He changed factory jobs last year to one with a more supportive work environment with more opportunities for advancement. However, his company is currently experiencing an unexpected slow season due to the economy, and there is not enough work for everyone at the moment. He barely makes enough money to cover expenses, and this has been the case for a few months. I am moving in with him over the summer to help with bills going forward and have been giving him whatever money I can spare. I was hopeful for an engagement ring and/or wedding for next year, but some other financial setbacks associated with homeownership (new gutters, having to replace appliances that don't work, etc) have almost completely diminished those hopes.\n\nNow to my brother. My brother has, in the three weeks since proposing, been repeatedly rude to me about his engagement. He makes remarks about me being a spinster, how he could get someone to marry him in six months when I can't get someone to commit in three years and this makes him a superior person, how I am too mentally ill to be a good spouse (I have ADHD and depression), I am not successful like my brother is so why would anyone marry me, etc. Meanwhile he and our parents are telling me that I have obligations for their wedding (I was a florist for a few years so I need to make the center pieces and the bouquets free of charge; I have run a small business making custom jewelry for fifteen years, so I have to make the jewelry for the bridal party; I have to be our elderly grandfather's chauffeur; I am expected to come early and set up; I am expected to stay late and clean up; I am expected to be a server and do dishes during the reception).\n\nI think I am well within my rights to demand some things change, given my brother's attitude. Namely, the bullying regarding my marital status (or lack thereof) and the demands they are placing on me when they purposefully picked a day that few people could attend. I think they are demanding too much of me when they simply expect me to do things and won't even ask if I can make it all work. Since it's finals, I might not even be able to take it off in the first place.\n\nSo... I think I know the answer, but I could use some insight. Would I be the asshole if I did not attend my brother's wedding?", "created_utc": 1687204043, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14dom84/wibta_if_i_didnt_go_to_my_brothers_wedding/", "score": 61, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I do not get families that demand over asking for a favor, but those are not good people.

However that being said, it could affect your relationship with him and possibly with your other extended family, so that's something you have to consider but if you're cool with the possible consequences than that's fine.  It does not make you a jerk.  He has been mean to you and in connection to \"marriage\".  You are feeling like he's rubbing it in your face, so I can understand why you wouldn't want to go.

NTA.\nThere seems to be a whole host of reasons why going to your brother's wedding is a bad idea and, other than 'he's family' and to keep the peace, no good ones for you. \nIf people have a mid-week wedding, it's to be expected that not everyone can go. It feels like they only want you to go for the things you can offer to keep their costs down. A wedding should be a joyous occasion for everyone and your brother sounds like he's being pretty mean; denigrating you, your relationship and, by extension, your partner. It wouldn't make me want to go!", "so NTA.  do not go to that wedding.", "What are you, Cinderella? The only thing that arguably makes you an asshole is your apparent wish to both skip your brother's wedding (right decision) *and* continue to cling to the abusive relationship you are enmeshed in with your family of origin. Screw these people! They are awful to you! Let them go and focus on the healthier relationships in your life. They have you confused about how you deserve to be treated. You are an adult with your own life. They don't get to make demands on you.", "NTA.\n\nYour family isn't even planning on having you as a guest.  They plan on you working through the event as well as before and after it.\n\nThey picked an inconvenient date and the consequences of that are that not everyone can attend, including some family.\n\nYou take care of yourself and let them find some people to hire.  Yes, they will have to pay them but that is part of having a wedding.", "Your brother sounds like a piece of work. Getting engaged after 6 months doesn\u2019t mean anything when you compare it to 3 years of a successful relationship. Unless they started living together when they first started dating, it takes longer than 6 months to fully get to know someone. Your relationship is also none of his business, so if you guys aren\u2019t engaged yet, that\u2019s your business not his. \n\nI will say, if you love your brother and you don\u2019t go to the wedding, just be prepared for the remainder of your lives to be different and potentially no contact. If that doesn\u2019t bother you though, I wouldn\u2019t go. Like I said, he sounds like a real piece of work and probably has some insecurity issues he\u2019s putting on you which is both disrespectful and degrading to you. \n\nAlso who cares how much money he makes? In my opinion, gloating about your money is the lowest personality trait one can have.\n\nNTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It's not worth the hassle.", "Teachers get more time than that, just use sick or state days\u2026 you\u2019re trying to find an excuse to not go", "My favorite part is the bully brother accusing her of being unsuccessful yet wanting to use her skills learned over multiple careers to save having to pay someone else", "ESH. Your family for being demanding jerks expecting you to give large amounts of free labor without your consent, your brother for being a tasteless and hurtful bully, and you for being unwilling to take the time off to attend a once-in-a-lifetime event that is important to your family.", "If it was on a Saturday, I would go without hesitation. I would even help clean, even as mean as he is. It's being told I'm doing the flowers for free and the jewelry for free on top of everything else plus having to use my one day off for it. That's just to much.", "My boyfriend probably can't go because that's his company's busy season. He will be lucky to get any time off around Christmas and New Year's.", ">They want you to be the florist for the wedding for free\n\nFlorist, jeweler, chauffeur (to grandpa), server and cleaner. All for free.\n\nAnd expensive gifts on top of that.", "I get the feeling my brother sees it as saving money, yes. I've done flowers and jewelry for friends' weddings in the past as my gift to them, and only when I could afford to take that hit. My family is not only expecting both for free, but my brother has asked me to get him other expensive gifts, like a new grill. \n\nI'm at the point where if it damages our relationship irreparably, I'm not sure there's much loss.", "It's not bad, actually. You get an additional personal day each year until you make tenure, at which point you automatically get five personal days a year. I get fifteen sick days, but taking two days or more off in a row requires a note of some kind (too many people in the district used their sick days to go to Hawaii and posted on social media about it...) I also get three days of bereavement leave plus two extra if it is an immediate connection death. I just starting there this year because it's closer to my boyfriend's house and will help us save money. That's why I only get one day.\n\nI really could make it work, but arrangements and jewelry are a ton of time on their own. Plus having to work the wedding itself for free? Why use that one day?", "If I am being honest, I don't expect them to last...", "That's something we talked about. I'm going on vacation to Diamond Crater for a week next month with his cousins (he won't take the time off with things as tight as they are) If we find anything there, that'll be my stone and I'll make the band and setting myself. Otherwise he has something picked out; he just can't afford the payments at the moment.", "My aunt is a baker and is making their cake... Now I want to know if they're doing this to her as well.", "I tried talking to my family about it once. I should probably bring it up again and make a point of it.\n\nEven with the flowers, the last time I did it, I was being paid to do that stuff, not for free. My family said the flowers and jewelry can be my \"gifts\" to my brother, but he is already asking me to buy him other expensive wedding gifts, like a new grill and to go halves on an oven/stove with my parents. He is spoiled and entitled af for sure, but someone has to draw the line somewhere.", "It's the time off issue. I would have to use my one personal day to go to his wedding. I wouldn't have any issues with that, but he is being a dick about the whole thing. Why should I give that up? What if I need to use it for something and I can't because I used it for my butt nugget brother?", "I understand not going to the wedding because it means: OP is the set up crew, OP is the clean up crew, OP is the dish washer, OP has to be grandfathers chauffeur and possibly care taker for the whole night this is in addition to making florals which takes a full day in and of itself, which I\u2019m not sure how she\u2019s supposed to fit all this in with driving to the event too, she has 24 hours of personal day, not a weekend off. She\u2019s not invited to the wedding as a valued guest and sister, she\u2019s being voluntold to be thousands in labor savings. She\u2019s being asked, in a financially tight circumstance, to provide free jewelry for the whole wedding party, NOT cheap, plus buy a grill and/or a stove with parents. All for a brother who, it sounds like can afford it, and on top of it is belittling her. I\u2019m stressed out just hearing about it, much less being in OP\u2019s position.", "She\u2019s being demanded tons of free labour and being bullied. She absolutely should no go or provide all the things they are demanding of her. She also explained why she only gets one day in the comments.", "I dunno... Would you want to use your one day off to go to support someone who is bullying you?", "The brother has known this woman for six months, this isn't going to be a once-in-a-lifetime event, lol.", "You are wrong: NOT going is the better choice here.", "OP, even if they change the day to a weekend, don't go.\n\nYou are obviously the scapegoat of the family.\n\nYou should be there as a guest with no work responsibilities to attend.\n\nPlease check out /r/raisedbynarcissists  to see if this resonates with you.\n\nAlso, when you move in with your BF, only spend money on things like utilities and food.  Do not contribute to any house improvements / maintenance.  Make sure that your share of expenses is not subsidizing him unnecessarily.\n\nYour eagerness to 'serve' your ungrateful family despite their overt disrespect towards you, implies that your normal meter is broken.\n\nHugs to You\n\nNTA - you should avoid this wedding, maybe attend the next one (engaged at six months, what a joke) but only as a guest not a servant.", "Are they expecting you to supply the flowers and jewelry pieces also or just make them after THEY purchase the raw materials? Not that it changes anything but one would make them even bigger AHs than they are.", "This would be an added no for me. Many hands make light work but this is a 2-way street. You don't even know if he would \"add value\" to your wedding when it's time, so stand with a nope on jewelry and flowers. \n\nSend your family chat that Love Song by Sara Bareilles. You get to choose how to share your talents, and expecting them is an automatic yeet....", "Oh I agree. I would not be going. I have always gotten 4 days right away. I seldom took them (same with sick days- retired twice with the maximum in the bank). But it was nice to have them when needed. 1 day is not enough.\n\nYeah expecting work out of you is ridiculous.", "If you would use your personal day for volunteer activities, I'm sure you'd make it for something that you are passionate about and support.  That likely isn't your bully brother and his enabling parents.", "Don\u2019t waste your time.", "OP, there is nothing to work out with abusers.\n\nIt seems like you need to go low contact but I would recommend No Contact.\n\nYou had to endure this abuse as a child but as an adult you have the independence to walk away from it and refuse to be treated this way.\n\n/r/raisedbynarcissists  as you seem to be in the FOG (Fear, Obligation, Guilt) emotional state.", "I hear you and emphasize with you. One thing to consider: years from now what are the higher chances of: you regretting giving up a day off or you regretting not going to his wedding.", "It\u2019s her brother, she should step up and go, it doesn\u2019t mean she has to do all of the requested things. She has the days and gets paid time off, she needs to suck it up, deal with the bullshit and do it to prove she\u2019s the bigger person. Sometimes you have to do shit you don\u2019t wanna do, this builds character.", "One day off for someone bullying you, including tons of free labour that she was demanded not asked to do, spend money on flowers and jewelry when she doesn\u2019t have the money, AND be a chauffeur. OP does not suck in the slightest.", "Why, fAaaMiLy, of course!\n\n/s", "I provide the raw materials they select. That has been part of my gift to friends in the past, but I have never done both for a wedding, let alone both for free.", "Lucky you, saving all those sick days... I am jealous. Hopefully I can get there myself one day!", "If I use my personal day for volunteering, it becomes a professional day and I keep my personal day. This wedding under no circumstances would be considered anything of the sort.", "I would regret not going to his wedding, but at the moment, going to his wedding involves a ton of free work on my part and not even the compensation of, \"I will be nice to you while you are doing so much for me.\" Like if he would just stop being a jerk - or even if my family would stand up - I'd go and help out and probably even do the jewelry. Flowers are too much, but everything else I can make work IF he will be nice about it.", "She absolutely does not need to prove she\u2019s the bigger person and that should not be used as an excuse to put up with being treated poorly.", "Agree to one if you want to, but don\u2019t feel obligated to do either!", "Go to his next wedding. We both know this won\u2019t be the only one he has.", "Just go as a guest you are 32 No is a full sentence.", "I feel like if I'm going to be expected to work the wedding, neither is the way to go."]}
