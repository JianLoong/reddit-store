They would only read if there was no one to talk to, therefore that's why *you* are reading.

I can\u2019t remember now if one finally did or not.", "I feel like in the right tone this could be a flirty joke but it would REALLY need to be the right tone and this girl clearly did not manage it", "Exactly! She could have said \u201cI noticed you\u2019re alone- would you like some company?\u201d He (in his clueless state) would have probably said no/he\u2019s busy. Then she could have said \u201cI think you\u2019re cute/i\u2019d like to chat\u201d (or whatever the young kids say these days)- OP would have realised she was flirting, instead of harassing him, and it would have gone from there.", "OP is a woman", "NTA\u2026I\u2019m pretty oblivious and I don\u2019t know if I would have recognized it as being hit on either?  Mainly because I wasn\u2019t expecting it?  This stranger is either odd or not really good at flirting? Calling you an AH? Um..weird interaction 100%\n\nOr she might be one of those people who just doesn\u2019t like to eat alone herself and felt some weird duty to join you?  I had a coworker like this and it drove me crazy.  I\u2019d take a book or magazine to the cafeteria at the office, find an out of the way corner table and eat my lunch while reading.\n\nThis coworker, nice lady, well-meaning I\u2019m sure\u2026well she would constantly sit down uninvited and join me at my little out of the way table, which meant my few precious moments of zen were over.  Always saying how she couldn\u2019t stand to eat alone or to see someone she knew eating by themselves.  I was polite about it for a while.  A LONG while. But sometimes when you work in the cubicle jungle and you hear the same people talking all the time all day\u2026 I just wanted some relative quiet away.\n\nFinally I just started eating at my desk or in a smaller break area and eventually she got the hint that I actually enjoyed spending my lunch hour alone.  \ud83d\ude05 I\u2019d love to have a regular spot to do just that: keep on being you, OP!", "YTA . Mega gaping. Super large.", "Cute story. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s authentic because you REALLY can\u2019t be that clueless, but at least it\u2019s a little cute.", "NTA. You\u2019re allowed to enjoy a nice dinner by yourself. That chick sounded extremely forceful and ballsy", "NTA. She is one of those people that thinks bc you're alone that you need conpany.", "NTA. I think she was trying to hit on you but she did a terrible job at it.", "This sounds a lot like a scene from the new season of Perry Mason where the Hollywood chick picks up Perry's partner...", "I bet she was an influencer and they were filming a tiktok. Just saying...this sounds like influencer behavior", "NTA. What a really strange situation. If the girl was going to be that forward she needed to be ready to be rejected.  \n\nTotally okay to eat alone!", "NTA OP. But as a lesbian she was hitting on you.", "You were well rid of her. Don't think anymore on it.", "NTA", "NTA. The chick took her shot and failed.", "Are you an engineer by any chance? When we first met, I had been flirting with my (now) husband for *weeks* and he was clueless. I finally had to just ask him out on a date.", "Lol. Tell me you\u2019re on the spectrum without telling me you\u2019re on the spectrum.", "YTC(lueless) \n\nThat said, I see how you offended by her approach. She went for a meet cute moment that caught you off guard.", "Exactly! And to call him an asshole for rejecting her is uncalled for. We wouldn\u2019t do the same if the roles were reversed.", "As a woman, nah. I only know someone is flirting with me if I\u2019m directly told so. Guys just assume women are better at these things more often but it doesn\u2019t mean that we are.", "NTA. Lmao my clueless ass, I'd do the same thing, OP. \ud83d\ude05", "It could work in real life, but characters in romcoms have plot armor.  It will work out, or not, as the story requires.  The real life chances might be 1 in a thousand, but fictional characters are overwhelmingly lucky, if the story requires them to be.  \n\nHowever, it IS a numbers game.  Every once in a while, someone shows up to a nice place, well dressed, made up, expecting a first-ish date and gets stood up and ends up sitting at the table, alone, lonely, and looking forward to a failed evening.  There would be a small, maybe 5 minute window, where if the right person, with the right personality and demeanor showed up at that moment and stepped in to fill the void, it would be welcome and accepted.  \n\nSo lets say you wish to seek out and move in on that exact situation.  You would have to visit a nice restaurant and quickly scan the crowd for a candidate:  someone eating alone.  It would take several more minutes of observation to determine definitively that they are not alone by choice.  Even then, approaching them directly would be predatory, almost by definition, so it would be somewhat less invasive to arrange to be seated in close proximity where engaging in harmless small talk might be a possibility.  That would of course require that such a seat is currently available.  \n\nThen, when approached by the waitstaff, express loudly enough so that you can be overheard that it will just be you tonight, as you just found out you got stood up, but intend to enjoy your evening anyway.  If this gives you a chance to engage in a moment of friendly banter with anyone else around you, so much the better.  Make it seem like you're alone, but approachable.  \n\nNow, there's a chance that your target will initiate conversation in some small way.  Just a chance remark, probably about being stood up as well.  Just that one tiny little opening that allows you to move in.  It could be done, but it's a lot of effort, and there are easier ways to get dates.", "She shouldn't have approached an obviously busy stranger. How is it that a person immersed in their books/laptops or what have you \"sends a signal\" that they need to be \"rescued from their situation\"?", "Insulting people is not flirting, at least not good flirting.", "So, a Ring Pop?", "Sorority initiation!"]}
