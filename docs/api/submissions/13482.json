It reminds me of a line from the Aztec Camera song *Oblivious:* \u201cThey think we\u2019re lonely when we\u2019re really just alone.\u201d", "NTA.\nYou got hit on and either weren't interested or didn't get it.\nNobody, especially a stranger, is entiteled to your attention.\nAnd who tf lraves a group to hit on a stranger, is that just weird to me? Is that normal behaviour?", "NTA. She was presumptuous and rude. Also, her \"flirting\" patter sucks!", "NTA.\n\nShe was hitting on you for sure. But this is my problem with people doing this kind of thing. Personally I have to know someone for a year before even considering dating them. I don\u2019t understand how people can come out of the gates so strong to a random stranger. If she completed your book or something that\u2019s one thing. But to just imminently  flirt with you is honestly a little tacky.", "NTA\n\nFlirting only works if one party is interested.\n\nYou weren't.\n\nThat makes her persistence intrusive.", "Am I the only person who saw the \"she was with a big group\" and immediately thought it was some kind of bible group /cult looking to nicely invite her to join their table and get sucked in? \n\nYes, I get that she was badly hitting on OP after reading everyone's answers. But the overt niceness combined with the group and telling her it's bad that she's alone immediately signals cult to me.", "That was an scam. She just wanted a free dinner. NTA.", "NTA.  And really, what the hell was she doing?  I wouldn\u2019t think anymore about it.", "NTA. I am dying this is so funny and classic gay women. \n\nI am picturing the other girl doing a double eyebrow pump when she says her line thinking she was so smooth. And then she's like okay this went over like a lead balloon but I can still save this, so I will just very directly tell her to take me to dinner. Still nothing ?\n\nI am picturing an aggressive fem that is new to the dating game so hopefully she's learned something lol", "NTA She was hitting on you but for her responses and the way she hit on you, I'm glad you didn't pick up on it.", "\"She said I needed to take her out to a proper dinner\" \n\nPlease let this be real cause it would be so funny.", "Info:  Is it no longer common for people to chat with a stranger and try to set up a dinner date?", "NTA. \n\nAs others have pointed out, she was hitting on you. So now you know why she acted that way and approached you. I am 100% certain of this because of her \"now you can take me to dinner\" comment and then calling you clueless. \n\nNow that this is cleared up, reminder you are still not an AH. No one is owed your time and attention. Sure, it is fine for someone to come up and say hi and see if you are interested in conversation, but they can do that politely and then take no for an answer and leave politely. She did not do that. She sat at your table, demanded your attention, threw out some judgements, and then called you rude for not entertaining her. She was the only rude one and you saved yourself dealing with her further by being clueless, so well done.", "NTA. She swung she missed. She\u2019ll live", "NTA\n\nPeople need to mind their own buisness. Being ALONE is different from being LONELY. \n\nMoms to toddlers who haven't peed alone in years would give their left arm to have a meal by themselves.", "NTA. Alone doesn\u2019t equal lonely and your life is none of her business", "NTA and I would find that confusing as hell also.", "NTA, and oh that useless saphic (*endearing sigh*) terrible flirting game. 0 stars.", "You were minding your own business, working, and not in the mood to be hit on. The only thing any of us need to be \"saved\" from is people like them. NTA", "What kind of idiot flirts by saying they are here to \u201csave them \u201c from what sounds like a perfectly lovely solo date? The level of narcissism is high.", "Really? I thought she was trying to sell an MLM, but I can see your argument that she was a WLW.", "This was the post I needed today! Ive been in a similar clueless situation: \"no i dont need help changing my flat tyre. I can do it by myself thank you very much.\"", "LOL And that was also one of the worst cases of attempted flirting I've ever heard about, and that's saying nothing about the other woman's clear inability to read a room.", "Not to mention \"you need to take me to a proper dinner\" like what", "Okay my ND brain TOTALLY didn\u2019t read that in OPs post \ud83d\ude02 whoops", "It'd probably work on 95% of dudes if she's even remotely passable looks-wise, but trying it on a chick is *really* ambitious.", "Game changing if it does work but I doubt it.  \ud83d\ude00\nSource: I like food (but I'm probably not that bold)!", "yeah, it's the 'you must secretly want to not be alone right now' attitude that's getting to me. and then she tries to spin it into a guilt trip with the rudeness line?\n\nputting myself in OP's shoes, even if i noticed the flirting i wouldn't be interested in her after seeing her entitled af approach to the situation.", "Opening line while flirting. She was open towards exchanging contact information. You gotta start somewhere to get their attention.", "Huh, that's new. Stealing a partial comment and using it as a thread-starter instead of just replying to the top comment. \n\nBad bot, u/fantdfghj", "For op? Homegirl couldn't pick up a stick with the terrible rizz she had. If I was op, I'd be questioning if that girl was trying to hit on me or insult me", ">Was she trying to pick you up?\n\nI believe she was trying to pick op up. The clueless AH part at the end and the dinner comment make it seem so. It's just unfortunate that homegirl is really bad at trying to pick up people", "Honestly, tho. That women had negative rizz. She gotta work on her game if she's trying to pick op up like that", "She literally asked you on a future date", "I\u2019d assume they were Christians with that language and promptly tell them to fuck off", "You\u2019re a genius :)", "It's a line to initiate a conversation. She was flirting, fishing for a positive response. She failed.", "I was sitting at a bar with 3 co-workers. They were talking work and I was just enjoying my drink. Somebody behind me poked me in the back. I took a quick look and didn't really notice anybody. On the 3rd poke, a lady at the table behind us (a table of several women) said something. She was attractive, fit and then she said \"I'm happily married but my friend here..\". I looked and a plus-size was smiling. I said hi to them all and turned around to engage in work conversation. I suspect they called me an AH.", "I mean.. it's Reddit... \n\nI'm married now and it happens less often because small town, everyone knows everyone, but I used to get hit on a lot. \n\nIn this case, I didn't see it either until reading the comments and was like.. wow what a rude and stupid way to flirt.", "I\u2019ve been hit on like this. Almost exactly like this, a few separate times, except I\u2019m a guy.\n\nIt *is* a weird way to hit on someone and tbh I think it\u2019s because it includes an element of judgment / negging. \n\n\u201cOh wow you must be so lonely and sad sitting here content with your own company - allow me to invade your world and save you.\u201d - The Worst Person At The Bar \n\nNow, married and in my thirties, I just shut it down immediately. I\u2019ve never, not one time, ever appreciated being randomly approached in public by someone who sees me and has decided that I really need them in my life in that moment.", "Nothing in the story implies that OP provoked the situation or being called AH. The entire situation was forced on her. The stranger forced herself on OP's dinner.", "please tell me what part isn't forced? OP is sitting happily alone, reading their book, waiting for food to show up. and then this self centered younger woman shows up acting like OP should be kissing her feet just because she was so gracious as to go and flirt with OP.\n\n'oh you were rude, now you HAVE to take me to dinner'\n\nwhat an insufferable attitude.\n\nif the stranger was acting like that because she was nervous about flirting with OP, maybe she should take a bit longer considering whether their next target will actually appreciate the advance. either way, leave OP alone 10 minutes earlier wtf.", "If I was OP I would still feign ignorance so I wouldn't have to deal with her and her attitude.", "I read it from an Outsiders perspective and didnt get it too. Now i wonder If there were Times i was Hit on and didnt get it lol", "When someone asks a stranger out for dinner....has that ever happened when they weren't interested in you?", "People that have negative rizz", "Other girl took a risk, OP couldn't muster a bare minimum level of communication. It's embarrassing.", "It's not obvious especially since she started insulting op. I think she was trying to be cute...", "fat shaming AH. I confirm", "What's the point of this story?", "Happens to me in airport restaurants. Ah, to be hit on when my mouth is full\u2026 to be fair I\u2019m often thinking of bed, maybe they pick up on that.", "1. There are no men in this story. \n2. Even if there was you'd still be wrong.", "Eh, get your point but it sounded hyperbolic to me too. Some phrases evoke specific connotations regardless of context.", "Seems like inflammatory language is something you use regularly, not everything in life needs to be that emotionally charged. Yes the woman was aggressively trying to hit on OP and it was wrong and she was clueless but the word \"forcing\" is very aggressive and unnecessary.\n\nWere not gonna change each other's opinions here so let's agree to disagree maybe", "Has anyone ever had success intruding on someone who's working on their laptop, demanding to be treated to a dinner ?\n\nThere are ways to hit on people that don't have this weird aura of negging energy (\"poor thing eating alone at a restaurant/cafe, I shall save you\"), that don't double down when the recipient seems uninterested..\n\nEspecially considering it wasnt an lgbt+ space, taking such an approach on a woman who might be straight is a foolish endeavor that's likely to make you look like an ass. Most straight women don't assume that other women talking to them are trying to flirt.", "Honestly doesn't matter - if she called you an asshole she isn't great because it was clear you didn't get what her point was. That's not your fault, that's hers.\n\nProper response: \"I am flirting qith you but I suck at it haha. Any way I can do better or are you not into it?\" \n\nHer saying that would have cleared up the situation for you and let her laugh off the failed attempt.", "There will come a time when you realize getting hit on by both men and women, doubles your chance for a date on Saturday evening.", "Since she called you an AH only because you did not understand her intentions, you did not miss much.", "Honestly tho it was an overly intrusive way to flirt. If OP had been giving some signs that she was interested or friendly before (even just making eye contact, smiling, etc.) it would have been cute. But when you flirt with someone, you're opening yourself up to getting rejected, so if it's gonna make you mad (which is a red flag anyways,) start with a less intrusive method.", "> Most people reading the story figured it out, so I think the problem rests with OP\u2019s ability to recognize it.\n\nCall me old fashioned but I like for people to say something flattering when they hit on me.

We are not in a whimsical romcom.", "Yeah I\u2019m not sure why someone\u2019s strategy would be to interrupt someone peacefully working on a laptop, tell them you\u2019re saving them from their loneliness, and then say they owe you a date for being annoyed at your intrusion. I know everyone\u2019s different, and I definitely don\u2019t consider myself a romantic, but I would probably just be annoyed.", "i know i'm not depicting the stranger in a charitable way, you're being dismissive of her role here. OP's night would have gone uninterrupted if not for the stranger imposing herself. she forced her presence upon OP by sitting at her table and repeatedly engaging in conversation.\n\nis it really so inaccurate to say forced here? i'm also fine with dropping it if you're not convinced, but her presence was at the very least unwanted and uninvited.", "From the sounds of it, I wouldn't call that flirting. \ud83e\udd23", "Yeah this was a hysterically bad attempt at hitting on OP and then she was a jerk about it because her ego was hurt.
