It sounds like she might have been trying to hit on you...in a really weird and intrusive way.", "NTA. Someone forced themselves on you. You were not rude in your response and they refused to listen to your response. Do not stop treating yourself. Just because the person who sat down cannot imagine eating alone, does not mean the many who are fine with it need to deal with interruptions from people who think they know better what you want. You know what you want. You are confused because of the sheer rudeness of this girl, and no, her intentions don't count for anything once you said you did not want company.", "NTA, OP.  I think it\u2019s adorable that you didn\u2019t realize she was hitting on you \ud83d\ude0a.

That said, once it was obvious you weren\u2019t interested and just wanted to be alone, she should of backed off as opposed to calling you rude. Ultimately, she was the rude one. \n\nSure, you could of gone out with her, but considering how demanding and rude she was in the few minutes she was there, you probably are fortunate you didn\u2019t go out with her.", "NTA they were either judging u maybe trying to scam u.... girl weird for approaching u....\nOnly thing is maybe they thought u were someone else but idk", "NTA\n\nIf that is what passes for hitting on someone...then its no wonder you were confused", "NTA. \n\nYou were engrossed in something and she interrupted you. It's not at all uncommon for people to use a restaurant as a place to get work done, as you clearly were doing. She was rude and obnoxious.", "Lol! NTA\n\nSo she basically was hitting on you and you didn't pick up on it. Now she knows what it's like to be a guy and get shot down all the time. Also, she should have been more direct and less confrontational about it. \"Save you from your situation\"? Like you don't have a life outside of the restaurant? Very very cheesy and cringey pick up line.", "NTA. That person was very very strange.", "NTA.  Honestly, that is strange and entitled behavior.  Glad you didn\u2019t strike up a friendship with that user.", "NTA. \nI mean you are allowed to eat alone.\n\nBut I agree with others - she was likely flirting with you, (clumsily IMO). And when you weren\u2019t interested or didn\u2019t grasp that (whichever) she should have politely left you alone.", "Nta she sounds weird", "NTA. Her behavior was weird as hell.

Oh hell no!!\n\nOP, you did nothing wrong at all.. Either this was her extreme clumsy way of trying to hit on you, or she\u2019s part of something she wanted to try to recruit you for.

And there are plenty of times people will try to interrupt someone reading without actually hitting on them. I have a theory that these are people who don't read (or actually dislike reading, odd as it seems.) I think these people believe they are *rescuing you* from the dreadful chore of having to read. They would only read if there was no one to talk to, therefore that's why *you* are reading. They feel that they have graciously attempted to rescue you from the torture of reading, and are utterly baffled when you don't fling yourself on their company.", "NTA. She was rude and maybe hitting on you but also maybe trying to get you to pay for dinner.", "NTA. She was hitting on you but you were obviously clueless.

Chuckle about it and continue to enjoy life.", "NTA and I didn't get the clues either that she was hitting on you, but now...I can see it. \n\nI'd say she was the clueless AH because you don't hit on someone by saying they need to take you out to a proper dinner.

If you ever see her again and she approaches you again, just tell her she sucks at flirting and you aren't interested.", "You are NTA.  There are many things you have described that would leave 99.9% of the world confused as well, and make me wonder if you were interacting with someone that might have some sort of diagnosis in which reading social cues is difficult.  Sitting down at a stranger's table, interrupting a stranger with a presumption of \"saving them from loneliness,\" and failing to react when you said \"you needed no help,\" along with her counter that you were rude and owed her a \"proper dinner\" is bizarre.", "You are clueless. She was hitting on you.\n\nBut you're still NTA.", "NTA. I suspect, by you being alone and being on a laptop (maybe you weren't dressed up like them or something like that, as well), that they made some judgements about you, and decided that you must be a \"clueless\" loser and decided to mess with you. So they could laugh about it and you later.\n\nYou were bullied, in junior high school fashion, at a public eatery. Your confusion is understandable, because people who are adults are not usually this proud of being TA in a childish way.", "You seem to smart to be asking such a stupid question\n\nNTA", "Don\u2019t worry.
