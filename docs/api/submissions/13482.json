Someone in the back didn't hear you.", "Why mention her size? \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "I feel like this is only flirting if you've never been allowed outside or around other people before, lmao.", "I feel embarrassed for the girl who thought straight up asking strangers to pay for her dinner would work", "I mean in the moment I can understand if OP is a straight woman not realising they\u2019re being hit on my another woman. Unless you\u2019ve previously been hit on before all your interactions with other woman are non-romantic so thinking \u201coh this person is trying to be romantic at me - a thing that has never happened with another woman\u201d might not cross your mind. You\u2019re probably trying to categorize the interaction within your previous experiences. \n\nI\u2019m not interested in people and so the two times men have hit on me I have had to ask my friends if that\u2019s what they were doing - and have been told \u201cyes, it\u2019s incredibly obvious\u201d. And like okay sorry I have to check - I don\u2019t think about men in any romantic setting it doesn\u2019t occur to me they might think of me that way.", "You are right, but it's easy to figure out when 2 other people are flirting, but we've all been oblivious at times when someone flirted with us. It gets even harder if the person is of the gender you aren't interested in.", "I dunno, I'm really good at reading flirting directed towards \\*other people\\* but one time I didn't realize a lady had been flirting with me all day (according to my wife) until she literally sat on my bed and put her hand on my leg.", "OP is a woman.\n\nI mean, sure, but she wasn't paying attention to OP's reactions. To flirt well you need to pay attention. But I guess it's subjective.", "\u201cSave me from my situation\u201d is language that points to  Christian than lesbian.", "You'd be surprised how often people are offensive when they're trying to flirt.", "I'm **sure** an attractive woman somewhere has tried that with a man who happens to be single and lonely and it's worked out.\n\nIt's probably worked with other combinations of genders, sexual preferences, and levels of attractiveness, too, but I'm less confident about that.", "That's a pretty bold assumption to make without knowing much about me considering my view on what I said about the line and actions of the woman hitting on OP.", "LOL\n\nOr maybe OP's almost as oblivious as me.  I've apparently been hit on before, by both men and women, and I didn't notice.   In fact, I was so oblivious, that I couldn't even recall their behaviour well enough to be able to tell one way or another, after I'd been informed that such an event happened.  :-D", "Yeah, she should have asked him out to dinner after interrupting him and sitting down uninvited.", "As someone that's pretty oblivious, what signals do women send when they're interested?", "Or, as Woody Allen said, it doubles your chances for rejection.", "Perhaps.. but your rejections double also.. so it evens out\u2026 so in reality i guess the odds remain even..?? \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "This reminds me of the number of times I had a dude walk up and tell me that now that he's talking to me I don't \"have to read\" anymore and can put down my book. Or \"you are alone, but I'm here to rescue you\" and ... just no for both of those. I am alone and reading because I want to be. That's arrogance taken too far, not just awkwardness. Oy. NTA", "What\u2019s a nice girl like you doing in a place like this IS basically the same as I sat with you to save you from being along. Not transparent or funny.", "im a gay woman and still don't know how to differentiate if a woman is being friendly or flirty. and on the other hand being wlw and being bad at \"flirting\" is more common than you'd think\n\nobviously not generalising. but it happens. i feel bad for OP and the other woman tbh.", "I totally missed that.  Probably made it a bit harder to reset the brain but my comment still applies.", "I think barney stinson has a play like that", "Negging is pretty common", "You probably could've told it without being fatphobic.", "Why? As a bisexual woman why does a woman get style points for something a man would have his head in his hands to play for the second he started?\n\nWhy are we giving some cute pass to LGBTQ+ creepiness? It\u2019s not a rom com. You get to ask \u2018is this seat taken?\u2019 and back the fuck off no matter your gender. Not slide into the seat and keep pushing.\n\nI\u2019ve had men and women do this. It\u2019s never cute. I am super flirty but flirting reads the room, mirrors cues and gives cues or anticipation and and room for enthusiastic consent. This is just being the arsehole who plonks themselves down thinking they are hot shit and you must be sat waiting for their presence. Good flirting never crosses to arrogant.\n\nIt\u2019s just shitty behaviour that if it was read as straight everyone would be totally \u2018oh my god, call the cops next time\u2019 level freak out. (Never my choice of move but YMMV) It\u2019s so pushy and yet people are still doing it in 2023? It was tacky in the 90s! No style points for the entire thing and LGBTQ+ people don\u2019t get to subvert *consent* for cutesies.\n\nLearn how to flirt. It\u2019s like perfume, most people shouldn\u2019t be able to smell it unless they want to lean into you. You should leave a fair number of people not realising because the flirting is in the subtlety, stages and build. This is more the can of Axe bath level of nuance and just as antisocial and unattractive.\n\nAnd if they aren\u2019t getting it but getting confused, annoyed, distressed, you have crossed the line already so wrap it up nicely and without more ego like calling them an asshole. It\u2019s like a masterclass in harassing but calling it hitting on. NTA.", "Fair enough. While I can't relate *at all*, you're right; some people must find this level of assertiveness attractive.\n\nI wouldn't say this approach is considered all that common or \"textbook\" at all, though. From my experience, people usually lead with introductions and a compliment lmao.", "I could see \u201cyou have to take me out for a proper meal\u201d as a joke if it fits the tone or air of the interaction. but the fact that she started with trying to \u201csave OP\u201d meant it came across as entitled AF", "Oh goodness, I'm very oblivious too so you're not alone. One time in highschool I went to a movie and the mall with my bf and friends. I thought we were just hanging out and was sooooo confused when at the end he said it was a good date. Then years later at a job a guy asked me to the movies and I'm just like sure! (We worked together so had talked to him some) and again, I just thought we were hanging out as friends but apparently he meant it as a date. Also I've apparently been flirted with when I was younger too and I didn't know and always denied it if someone mentioned it. Now, I don't count anything as dates unless both parties know \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23", "I (F) worked at a health club when I was 21. One woman would always come up to the desk and just talk and talk. I had lived a very sheltered life up to that point. It was some time before someone told me that she was a lesbian and was hitting on me. I was just like, \"Oh, I'm not a lesbian.\"", "Well, I'm pretty clueless as well. One asked me to dance, and I didn't get the bigger picture until later but at least I got the dancing part.\n\nOnce I was traveling in a train. When I entered the train, this woman looked at me like I was her long lost friend or just the most amazing creature she has ever seen. It was nice, but confusing. After I sat down, she looked in my direction constantly and observed my every move, but everytime I looked at her she looked away. When I had to pass her to go to the bathroom, she turned away in a coy way. I was like what the hell is going on. Before exiting the train after several hours I looked back at her and she gave me this look of sheer sadness and disappointment as if we just missed our destiny. In my mind I was like what do you want from meeeee woman.", "Exactly.", "Bisexual just means more chances for rejection.", "bi (or pan) erasure is the worst!", "yah. probably could have. but did tell it as i recalled it. none of us were hitting on any of the women. why did they think i (us) was fair game?", "yeah...no not this way lol", "Also, if a guy did that he'd be called a creep and aggressive. Being a woman doesn't give her a pass to be so intrusive and entitled to OP's attention!", "I thought maybe she'd been dared by her friends to do it.", "Yeah this stranger trying to \"save\" her is what got me. Like go white knight for someone else, this is unwelcome.", "I agree.  My friend getting shot down results in \"better luck next time.\"  If my friend goes all aggro it results in \"what the fuck is your problem, no wonder you down in flames you idiot.\""]}
