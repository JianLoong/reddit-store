My aunt had been taking care of them before I came up, and my mom has a clear favouritism for them, like when we go to visit her, I\u2019m told to leave the room and give them time with my mom, and for other reasons I won\u2019t get in to.\n\nThis morning I get woken up by my aunt saying my mom wants me out of the house as my brothers need their space and they feel as if they can\u2019t come out of their room and the cat won\u2019t go near me, and I was told that I should go visit her before I go back to my boyfriends (but I don\u2019t want to visit her after what just happened), which again is 2 hours away, so I obviously won\u2019t be able to visit her every day as I don\u2019t drive and he can\u2019t drive me up every day, and I will not be taking a 3-hour train one way every day to go see her when she does this to me.\n\nSo AITA for not wanting to visit my mum today cause she kicked me out again and idk if I wanna go visit her again.", "created_utc": 1701204407, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/186691i/aita_for_not_wanting_to_go_see_my_mom_after_she/", "score": 95, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Something tells me it's not because you were an angelic daughter and stellar sister.    \n\n\nI'm only going to touch on your brothers a bit. Your brothers, who have special needs (I have an autistic son myself), have been living without you for the past several years and routine can be a lifesaver for them. You disrupting that routine, regardless of the reason, and you should recognize that. Favoritism? Maybe. Necessity? More likely.\n\nBut the bottom line is that's your mother and you clearly don't hate her enough to not see her at all. So take the time to go see her before you go back to your boyfriend's house. It may be the last time you get to and, trust someone who's a lot older than you and who's lost a lot more people than you, you will regret not having that last bit of time. Maybe not tomorrow or next month, but eventually it will hit you. And it'll suck. All this petulance is silly in moment's like these. \n\nGo see your mother.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

And its REALLY not ok because she IS your mother.. Its crazy how much we bend for our parents and love them still, when of all people in the world, they should be the last we should have to guard ourselves against. Shes using her diagnosis to make unreasonable demands of you. I have an incredibly abusive horrible father and now that im 37, hes getting up there in age. I think all the time about what im gonna do when I get that call. I STILL don't know, and here you are running out of time in that situation, you poor thing. What I DO know is whatever choice I make is my choice based on my experience of this person and how they treated me. Whatever you decide to do, what matters is that YOU are ok with it.  Not that anyone else has to approve or understand. Someone who treats you poorly does not have the right to ask you for anything. Even if its your mother, ESPECIALLY if its your mother. Im so sorry. I know I sound harsh, but I'm sure whats going on feels harsh af to you. She should be trying to make things right and the fact that she isn't has got to fucking crush you.
