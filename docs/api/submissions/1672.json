Your friend should've been asking you for a third, not half, all along.

She an adult and certainly should be part of the conversation.\n\nThe comment about her coming home with you was an AH comment for sure, but don\u2019t let guilt about the comment push you back into the situation you were in before.

To Tommy: if you respond to him at all (which you don\u2019t have to) you should say \u201cI\u2018ve let this slide for years, and now it\u2019s getting unreasonable.

Btw, you might remind him the the \u201cproper way\u201d to divide a check is for him to always pay for his wife even if she isn\u2019t working and their finances are separate.

Letting go of the rationalization and accepting your point of view would strip away the shield he's been using to not have to face up to the fact that what they are doing is now in no way justifiable. He'd have to look in the mirror and see a person who deliberately exploits a friend's good nature for a few bucks.", "NTA\n\nI don't think I have ever encounter a couple who viewed themselves as a singular unit for a restaurant check.  And I have seen loads of stingy behavior with checks.  But never that one.\n\nIt's weird.  There are three of you, the check should have always been split 3 ways.  I understand how a 3 way split makes it more complicated, so I can totally see how you would get into the habit of not bothering when it is an inexpensive restaurant (though they should have offered the first few times).  But the second you said oh no, it's a 3 way split, he should have agreed.  His whole complaint that you embarrassed him and should have paid as a man is beyond weird.  *Some* men like to pay for their partners, which is fine. But she is not your partner.  Men don't just team up to pay for all the women around them.  *He* should have been the one picking up the tab for *his* wife, like it is \"proper to do\" from men, apparently.", "Nta", "NTA. You could have handled it better though... is a friendship worth $13?", "NTA- he is taking advantage of your good nature, then trying to guilt you about it, the fact that he told you to be a man about it is laughable if he wanted to be a real man, he wouldn\u2019t expect help to pay for his wife\u2019s meal\u2026", "NTA \n\nYou should only have to pay for what you\u2019ve had.

Wow, what an entitled a$$ he is, if they were gonna split it they should have always been paying 2/3 to your 1/3.  Personally I just prefer to pay for what I ate and drank cause sometimes mine will be more than whoever I'm dining out with and I prefer not to stiff them with the costs.

You're friend is being cheap.

Your comment about her coming home with you half the time was rude and I would apologize for that. But you absolutely should not be paying her bill unless you want to for whatever reason.

You are NTA for suggesting a split bill, but what you said afterward was out of line. \n\nAnd your friend doesn't get any points for not wishing to discuss this in front of his wife.
