Letting go of the rationalization and accepting your point of view would strip away the shield he's been using to not have to face up to the fact that what they are doing is now in no way justifiable.

I understand how a 3 way split makes it more complicated, so I can totally see how you would get into the habit of not bothering when it is an inexpensive restaurant (though they should have offered the first few times).  But the second you said oh no, it's a 3 way split, he should have agreed.  His whole complaint that you embarrassed him and should have paid as a man is beyond weird.  *Some* men like to pay for their partners, which is fine. But she is not your partner.
