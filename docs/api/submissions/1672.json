Letting go of the rationalization and accepting your point of view would strip away the shield he's been using to not have to face up to the fact that what they are doing is now in no way justifiable.

I understand how a 3 way split makes it more complicated, so I can totally see how you would get into the habit of not bothering when it is an inexpensive restaurant (though they should have offered the first few times).  But the second you said oh no, it's a 3 way split, he should have agreed.  His whole complaint that you embarrassed him and should have paid as a man is beyond weird.  *Some* men like to pay for their partners, which is fine. But she is not your partner.

I don\u2019t", "My best friend and I are boring.... So we would LOVE to go with you. Hell we will bring our husbands too! \n\n\"of course we will pay you our part when your friends leave... We wouldnt stick you like that \"", "Or he's holding the \"I'm paying for everything now\" card over her head and OP busted his act.", "I'm assuming she there when her hubby is telling the wait staff to split the bill in two. \n\nShe's been doing this for a long time, expecting both to pick up her tab. She's a user. \n\nHubby also got used to doing this. If he's embarrassed,  then he needs a reality check. \n\nShe's choosing not to work and hubby choosing to accept a reduced household income.", "NTA \n\nYou didn't marry Dee so she is not your responsibility.", "NTA. Your friend is just annoyed that you\u2019re finally laying down boundaries", "NTA at all he shouldn't have ever expected you to do this.\n\n  \nIf they have an agreement about how they do their household stuff then that's fine but you don't need to subsidize her.", "NTA she isn't your wife so you shouldn't be paying for her to eat free.", "Feeding his wife is his responsibility - not yours. NTA.", "NTA. \nAlso WTF. \nMaybe in the 50s it would have been expected for the men to cover the meals for any women in the party, but the horse left that barn a half century ago.", "NTA. You pay for what you order,  end of story.  They need to figure out their finances and stop expecting you to fund their night out", "NTA. He and his wife are being freeloaders.", "NTA I had a friendship end over something similar. They kept bringing their child and not including her when we split the bill. That tiny little 8 year old ate a full adult portion and the last time we went, I couldn't order what I wanted as we were sharing and then my other friend with us didn't even get dessert as the daughter had finished it. I don't blame the child  but the following time I ordered separately and let them know before we ordered that I was doing so as my diet.... Suddenly the invitations stopped. \n\nA mooch is a mooch. And they are often TAs when caught out", "NTA they're both rude af", "NTA. Your friend is the huge asshole. Expecting you to subsidise his wife? If he\u2019s complaining about you being a man, he should be able to be man enough to cover his wife!!!", "They want you to subsidise her decision not to work? \n\nThere's two of them, they need to pay for themselves, or not go out to eat if they can't afford it. \n\nNTA", "NTA. Why should you?", "NTA", "NTA\n\nmake sure you are included in the prenup if that's the case.", "NTA This drives me nuts. I have a few friends that do this with their kids. They bring multiple kids, and I bring my only child, and they expect to split the bill down the middle. When they were little, it was no big deal, i just paid an extra few dollars for a kids meal. But now they are teenagers, they order full meals, appetizers, sides, smoothies. And my daughter is a fairly light eater. I would start getting annoyed when their kids would waste massive amounts of food, because I was basically paying for it. So I started asking for separate checks, you\u2019d think I was trying to win the cheapskate Olympics by the reaction.  I still don\u2019t know on what planet expecting to simply pay your own way makes you cheap. Or how it\u2019s this massive inconvenience to the server to split a bill. \n\nAs an aside, it should have zero bearing that you make more money or Dee does not work. Fair is fair. \n\nAs another aside, that comment that the men should split the bill? So sexist!", "NTA. If he\u2019s embarrassed he can\u2019t afford a meal for him and his wife, that sounds like a him problem.", "Hire a couple of heavies in dark suits and dark glasses, ear pieces, etc. You cover them in 1/2 the bill, plus your friends think you are up to something.", "NTA", "NTA your friends sound like mooches", "NTA, not your wife, not your responsibility. Maybe saying she didn't come home with you half the time was a bit harsh, but he's taking the piss. Perhaps it's time to rethink this 'friendship'.", "NTA, sounds like he\u2019s not a friend at all.", "NTA he was embarrassed that you called him out on using you.  It's time to consider your friendship on this.", "NTA. They've been using you under the guise of friendship. Glad you put a stop to it. She wants to eat he needs to pay.", "No you shouldn't it's completely unfair, if they spoke to you first then it could have been exceptable but not just expecting you to pay everytime", "YTA for not speaking up before going to the fancy restaurant.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nThoughts you should consider:\n- if all three of you are friends why is his argument that you are embarrassing him on front of his wife\u2026He\u2019s distancing you from the friendship. \n- has he used this argument before with others, perhaps, to shame them into accepting this?\n- because seriously, you\u2019ve known them since middle school and it sounds like he\u2019s taken advantage of this the entire time\u2026.possibly with everyone and yes you\u2019ve every right to call him on it.", "NTA\n\nThere\u2019s nothing wrong with refusing to serve as a human BOGO for your friends. \n\nTell Tommy that you\u2019ve been more than generous in the past but that doesn\u2019t obligate you to anything going further. If he doesn\u2019t want to fully pay for Dee\u2019s meal, then only the two of you should get together. It\u2019s not your responsibility to financially support either one of them.", "NTA. I think you could have brought this up before the meal, though, especially if you knew that it was a more expensive place.", "He embarrassed himself and his wife, asking other man to pay for his wife's bill is so below and i would pay for myself in shame and leave, if my husband pulls that stunt.

She should also be embarrassed for refusing to work and needing to be paid for.", "NTA", "NTA. He needs to \"be the man\" and pay for his partner. I'm sorry this is happening but they're using you for subsidy. People have friends of various income levels and it doesn't give anyone permission to demand a handout. He doesn't sound like a true friend.\n\nEdit: I remembered I had a friend who made less than me and was from a less advantaged background. When we went out she would only agree to spend time together if I paid. At first I didn't mind then I realized that she wasn't even engaging in a meaningful way during our meals. I finally went LC for a few years and grey rocked her. We reconnected recently and our conversations are great but I no longer go out to meals with her. We mostly just have phone calls.", "NTA this is why my fiance and I get separate checks from the  start. Then no one can pretend they didn't understand the assignment.", "NTA - for not wanting to pay 1/2. If you\u2019re splitting the bill of 3 people eating, your share is 1/3rd (unless they only ordered one meal between the two of them, which is unlikely but not unheard of). If your friend\u2019s wife isn\u2019t working then it\u2019s up to him to pay her share, not you. \n\nHowever, you could have responded in a way that was much less inflammatory.", "NTA\n\nThat's his wife, he should be paying for her not you.", "If Dee has never paid during or since college, I'd argue she's a moocher not a friend. BUT if you've never protested before, I can see how they're surprised now.\n\nIf three people eat, three people pay. If Tommy chooses to pay for his non-working wife, that's up to them. It should have nothing to do with how much you earn. They sound jealous and entitled. This 'friendship' may have run its course.\n\nESH - you could have been politer about it.", "NTA. Yeah this is the fact and what that means is that their household now has a reduced stream of income $ to work with?", ">They come to the restaurant as a family unit and should therefore be paying for themselves as a family unit.\n\nExactly this. If I were to quit my job tomorrow and go out to dinner with friends, I wouldn't expect the bill to be split between only the people who were employed. \n\nTommy is the only one responsible for paying for Dee's food because presumably, he is the one person who is making money for their family unit and who benefits from Dee staying at home to be a homemaker. I even had to go back and make sure OP wasn't living with Tommy and Dee, which would be the only situation that kind of justifies Tommy expecting OP to help pay for Dee's food.", "That\u2019s the question, though, isn\u2019t it? Is this dinner a meeting of 3 friends, with 2 friends covering their unemployed buddy? Or is this a meeting of a couple and their friend? Where the couple covers themselves and the friend covers themself? It sounds like there just might be a difference of perspective here. Probably should have been clarified a bit earlier in the fancy dinner case, but maybe they can talk it out clarifying the above question?", "Exactly. I sometimes go out for meals with friends mostly in couples but there could be 1-3 of us single or without their partner. \n\nWe all work out what we had, because some are veggies and often spend less. Or If we\u2019re happy to split the bill I split it by the amount of people and then each couple will just pay x2 to make sure they cover both of their head. It\u2019s so easy even in larger groups, he has no excuse.\n\nWe do this the same with holidays and the like. I always just split everything \u201cper head\u201d because people in a couple know how many people they are and just pay double or pay individually. \n\nSplitting Per head is the right way to go if you aren\u2019t wanting to count exactly what you had.", "That\u2019s a good point, especially if they\u2019re married she *should* have a hand in their finances, working or not. Tommy acts like she\u2019s some kind of stupid damsel to be spoiled by all around. Tacky.", "Yeah, isn't it more embarrassing NOT to pay for your wife's meal? Also, this might just be me, but the concept of there being anything that could embarrass you in front of your spouse is just... weird. This is likely the closest person you have in your life, how are you embarrassed?", "Exactly this.\nOP's friends were abusing him all the time. Once the guy married this girl he is financially responsible for her after they decided she'd stay home and not work anymore. The entitlement of him to expect another man to pay for his wife's food.....\nNTA.", "I don't think he needs to apologise for the remark because the remark wasn't serious, it was essentially satire.

But I\u2019ve known single people who bum food of people and don\u2019t work for extended periods. The bottom line is they should just have a common understanding of what this dynamic is and who\u2019s subsidizing it. It\u2019s not an AH move to not subsidize the third person, but springing it right when paying something expensive is a little late. When making the plans, a \u201cyeah, I\u2019m up for going somewhere nice as long as you pay for your wife\u2026\u201d or something.
