Yesterday was my wife's best friend birthday and we all were invited to celebrate it in a very fancy restaurant with open bar and all. Due to my personal work obligation I was not able to join them for celebration but wife was there. So when she was leaving I asked her what time she will be returning and she said around 12.30 or 1 am and I specifically told her to drink moderately.\n\nArround 12.30 i texted her saying that I am sleeping because I had a office in morning. Then around 1.20am wife got home and she was drunk AF. She couldn't walk straight, her breath was stinking then started throwing drunk tantrums. She started throwing her clothes/jwellery everywhere, she threw her keys at the table and it broke our photo frame and after that I was loosing my patience fast. I helped her change then instead of taking her to the bed I placed her on couch in living room because I didn't want to share bed with drunkass . Next morning I woke up in sour mood, got ready and went to office and she was still asleep. Arround 11pm I got a text from my wife saying why she was not in our bedroom then I gave her one lengthy text saying how awful she was and also told her I will never tolerate this BS again ever. Instead of apology i got why are u acting like my parent? Then again we have row of argumentative text.
