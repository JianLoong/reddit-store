My mom has been excited about this special dish shes been wanting to make all week. So, yesterday evening my mom begins making this jambalaya dish. She claims it tastes better after it sits for a day to enjoy the following day. She makes a large pot of a tomato based stew for it with cooked sausages, bacon, vegetables etc. She finishes it around 9pm. I wake up today and it's been left out on the stove for over 12 hours in a covered pot, no heat( it's currently almost 10am). I don't believe she plans on touching it again until she makes the rice for it later today for tonight's dinner. \n\nI know for a fact, especially now after researching it that food can't just be left out like that for so long especially with meat in it. I now have to make things very awkward and potentially embarrassing for her by saying my breastfeeding wife, 2 year old toddler and myself will not be risking that tonight for dinner. \n\nI know she's going to say things like \" I've been feeding you your whole life and you turned out fine\" \" I do this all the time and I've never been sick\" \" don't believe everything you read online\" etc etc \n\nWIBTA for confronting her on this and not letting my family eat this food? \nIf so, how can I NBTA during this confrontation? \nWe're still visiting for another few days.\n\nEDIT*** there is also shrimp and ham in the dish, left overnight.

Food code states 4 hours after cooking to get to 40 degrees F. Realistically, that was written to be extra cautious (as restaurants feed a lot of people and food borne illnesses are of greater concern there) so at home you could stretch that to 6, maybe 8 hours if you wanted to be risky. After 12+ hours, that is just a pot of bacteria with some food stuff in it. \nI\u2019d be honest and kind with mom. Tell her that it smelled great yesterday, but you won\u2019t eat that pot.

One, eat the food and risk getting sick. possibly very sick.  Two, sit down and have an adult conversation with your Mother about food safety.

My Mother was the same way about food handling, making me sick many times as a child.

I stir what's in the pot to make sure everything gets in contact with the cool sides of the pot and add more ice periodically while it's cooling. I put the pot or the food separated into smaller containers in the fridge and leave it. This allows the flavors to become richer while not allowing bacteria to develop. \n\nI think the only way what your Mom cooked might be safe is if she boiled the hell out of it for awhile. Theoretically the bacteria would still be there but would be killed.

About half of food born illnesses are caused by infectious bacteria, parasites, or viruses, which can be killed by reheating. \n\nMany, however, are caused by toxins that bacteria secrete. The longer food sits out between 40-160 degrees (ideal growing conditions), the higher the amount of toxins. Anything over 4 hours, and the food should be discarded. Those toxins are there to stay, no matter how much or how hot you heat the food.  This includes botulism, which has a high rate of death. It also includes staphylococcal (staph), which is very common. We carry staph on our skin.
