Growing up she might make Sunday dinner or a random meal during the week. Fast forward to now, I'm almost 30 and have my breastfeeding wife and two daughters (1mo, and 2yo) over visiting my retired parents for the week. My mom has been excited about this special dish shes been wanting to make all week. So, yesterday evening my mom begins making this jambalaya dish. She claims it tastes better after it sits for a day to enjoy the following day. She makes a large pot of a tomato based stew for it with cooked sausages, bacon, vegetables etc. She finishes it around 9pm. I wake up today and it's been left out on the stove for over 12 hours in a covered pot, no heat( it's currently almost 10am). I don't believe she plans on touching it again until she makes the rice for it later today for tonight's dinner. \n\nI know for a fact, especially now after researching it that food can't just be left out like that for so long especially with meat in it. I now have to make things very awkward and potentially embarrassing for her by saying my breastfeeding wife, 2 year old toddler and myself will not be risking that tonight for dinner. \n\nI know she's going to say things like \" I've been feeding you your whole life and you turned out fine\" \" I do this all the time and I've never been sick\" \" don't believe everything you read online\" etc etc \n\nWIBTA for confronting her on this and not letting my family eat this food? \nIf so, how can I NBTA during this confrontation? \nWe're still visiting for another few days.\n\nEDIT*** there is also shrimp and ham in the dish, left overnight. It's now been 14 hours since last heated and left out.\n\nEdit number 2** there is also chicken In it I didn't know that till recently, it's been now 17 hours so idk. I text her about it as she's at work now expecting to make the rest when she gets home.\n\nFINAL EDIT*** She actually didn't make much of a stink about us refusing to eat it. Said she's done it before this way And they were fine but she understands my concerns. My parents are going to continue to eat it for dinner anyways while we have something else.", "created_utc": 1686232308, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1449vp3/aita_if_i_dont_allow_my_family_to_eat_my_mothers/", "score": 2189, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I don't know if it's some new age Cajun Voo-doo shit, or what, but my SIL has started doing that. She left some Boudain Casserole out over night one night. (At Thanksgiving...I guess she wanted to make the maximum # of people sick). She sat there and doubled down on her asshole move by saying that they did it back in the \"old days\" and people were fine. No, they weren't. They died of diseases like....oh, I don't know....SALMONELLA!!!!! I had no idea she had left that dish out over night, I had watched her prepare it the night before, so I had grabbed a little bit the next day at lunch. My Mom stepped on my foot right before my fork got to my mouth. She's lucky I didn't fling my food at her. I love my Mom, but it pisses me off when she does that shit. Anyway, I calmly set my fork down and asked her what in the hell was wrong with her. She picked up her napkin...like she was being sly or something...and told me that my SIL never put the Boudain Casserole in the Fridge. WTF??? (I think I said that part out loud)!! LMAO! I looked at said SIL and she just smirked. Yep, she's a special one alright. I didn't eat that casserole. My brother did, he got sick. Hmmm...I WONDER from what???", "NTA. That\u2019s disgusting. Everyone could get VERY sick", "NTA. Seriously. I thought it might be that she\u2019s a bad cook (seasoning wise) but this is just something else. You can get really sick with that. You\u2019re fine keeping out for 2 hours after cooking or until it cools down to be stored in the fridge. This is just so dangerous. I\u2019m thinking of Listeria and such. She should have just let it cool to room temperature and just stored it in the fridge. \n\nIt\u2019s best to get whatever food safety and handling advice from your country to show to her why you are not eating it. It makes you seem sensible and not a Asshole. Also just tell her and speak to her about it because she can get herself very ill with that. \n\nWhatever you don\u2019t let your wife or child eat it.

But NOW it needs to rest in peace in the garbage.", "From what I recall, from my food safety course, is that food is required to be properly cooled down (below 10 degrees celcius) in less than 3 hours. It should then be properly reheated before being eaten - as in, lukewarm heating up is not sufficient.\n\nWill someone die from eating it? With current food safety standards, probably not.

You have a toddler and a breastfeeding wife. None of you should be sickened by the food to save your Mom's \"pride.\" The food is spoiled. It is no longer fit for human consumption. Plain and simple. \n\nYou don't have to be a health inspector to know this food is unsafe (my late dad was one for 40 years, so I grew up knowing how to safely handle food). You could get sick.
