UK inheritance law states that if an unmarried person dies without children then their estate goes to their parents (common law marriage not recognised). We're having a floating deed of trust but I mentioned to my mother (F54) that I also plan on writing a will so my partner will be able to inherit my part of the house if I die. She completely lost it and said that she deserves to inherit it because she raised me and it's not fair if he gets to keep all of it. I asked her how she would get her share if the money is all tied up in the house and she said she would force a sale so she can cash out, which would make my partner homeless. All I want is for him to be able to stay in the house if I die. \n\nAnother argument she made was that his mother would make me sell the house to pay her off if he died before me, which I know wouldn't happen because his family has always kept hold of whatever buildings they inherit and allowed other family members to live in them for free, e.g. The aunt that still lives in his grandparents' house even though the house was supposed to be sold and divided between 8 children when they died. \n\nShe later changed her mind and said she wouldn't make him sell the house, she would just make him pay her whatever I've put into the house in cash. I'm putting in \u00a390,000 and he's putting in \u00a350,000. There's no way he'd be able to pay her off in cash without selling the house. She then said that he's going to kill me to get the whole house. \n\nShe says she deserves to inherit my estate if I die because she brought me up and fed me when I was a baby, and she paid for all my extracurricular activities when I was growing up and it's not fair if I leave everything to someone else. She says I'm not taking into consideration my parents' struggle but they own 2 properties, totaling over \u00a31m in assets. \n\nMy partner and I currently live with my parents and pay rent (below market value). Everything for the house is coming out of our own savings, neither of our families are contributing. My parents need to find \u00a370,000 within the next 2 years as they plan on paying for my brother to attend flight school. Their current plan is to sell one of their properties to pay for this but it would be very convenient if I died before then and left them everything. \n\nThe way I see it, if we break up then the deed of trust will protect me financially, but if I die then it won't matter to me who gets to spend my money. But I want my partner to be able to stay in the house and if I allow my mother to inherit it then she'll likely force my partner to sell his home. To her, I'm basically leaving \u00a390k to someone I've known for a few years vs her who I've known for my whole life.\n\nEta: My family is from Asia and one of the laws in our home country is that if a child dies before their parents then their parents are entitled to a share of the estate as well as their spouse and children.

The short version is that my husband will never personally own any of it, unless a series of unlikely events takes place. (As is the same with my siblings and their shares.)

Is he not writing a will that leaves you his portion of the house?", "NTA\n\nBut I would only write him in the will as receiving your share of the house if he is doing the same thing for you in his will. Are you two going to get married?\n\nYour mother is an insanely entitled person thinking that because she birthed you and took care of you when you couldn't yet take care of yourself (because you were a baby and then a child), that somehow you owe her something. I resent people who think like that. You didn't choose to be born. Your mother made the choice to have offspring. If she didn't want to make that time/financial investment, she could have easily chosen not to by abstaining from sex or using reliable birth control or even choosing a termination if all else failed. If you have kids you have them out of the selfish reason that you want them. The child doesn't owe the parent(s) f all no matter how many hobbies your parent(s) funded for you, lol.\n\nDoes your father share your mother's entitlement?\n\nI am sorry, what struggles do your parents have owning 2 properties (totaling \u00a31M)? If they don't have enough spending money every month, they should sell their second property. End of.\n\nFlight school is massively expensive, no? Don't people usually take out loans for that? Is this for commercial airline pilot? Does your brother know that the earning prospects/prospects of a stable career might be tremendously diminished compared to a decade (or two) ago? Many airline pilots are forced into dodgy contracts with (budget) airlines IF they want to have any pilot job. Are your parents aware of this, or do they still think your bro is going to be raking in the cash once he's got his pilot's licencse?\n\nI can't believe they are essentially hoping you'll die in the next few years so that your share of the house (right now this would be \u00a390k) is going to fund their other child's luxury education. What are these people on?!\n\nWith whom do you see your future? Your partner, right? If I were buying a house with a partner, I would probably back out of this when I learned that after they die, they want to leave their share to anyone else but me. You are either a unit together for the future, or you are not. If you are each going to leave your share of the house to another person after you die, you are basically just friends/housemates who decided to bundle finances to be able to buy but you are not a unit together.\n\nYour mother is just seeing \u00a3\u00a3\u00a3 signs and only thinking about how she could benefit from you (your death). That's a disgusting attitude. Your bro should take out loans for his flight school. If he can't get a loan or the conditions are horrible (as in: very high interest or whatever), then maybe he doesn't consider this investment worth it and then he might need to rethink his future plans. An alternative is your parents selling their second property if they believe in their son's pilot ambitions so much they think it's worth supporting him to such a large amount of money. But none of this has anything to do with you.\n\nSounds like your mother thinks you owe her something, maybe because you are currently living with her for below-market rate. Are you paying a reasonably fair amount (depending on how much of the house is for your private use) or are you only paying, say, \u00a3300 a month all in (including for utilities and food etc)? If it's the latter and you are basically given a super cheap deal, maybe consider paying more. Maybe you have been living with your parents for longer than they anticipated and maybe they now feel taken advantage of? If you think that's the case, ask what kind of amount they feel is more fair towards them. If you and your partner think that still gives you a good deal, stay. However, if then it's so much that it's similar to renting privately, I'd rent privately so you no longer give your mother a reason to be so entitled. It's one thing to ask a family member or friend whom you helped out a lot to pay you back a (huge) favour in the future. It's quite something else to be expected to inherit a (big) share to a house after your child dies when the other owner is the person now widowed.\n\nI would tell your mother you have no plans of dying in the next few years, and that although you have known her your whole life, your future life is with your partner. It's totally normal for adult children to move away from family to start their own life, and for the person whom they choose to share their life with to become the main person in their life. What if you were to have kids, does your mother still expect to inherit your half of the house? What if she dies before you do, who is going to then inherit your share when you die, your father, your brother?\n\nAlso, if she is using the argument that she's known you for longer, I'd just tell her that she's probably going to die decades before your partner so that your future is clearly with your partner, aside from the fact that you are not in a relationship with your mother and will no longer live with her.\n\nNTA", "Nta", "NTA\n\nThat said, make sure you have a letter of wishes drafted with the will expressly stating that you wish your mother to not inherit the house and why. because i guarantee she will try to contest the will and a letter of wishes will make it much easier for your partner's lawyer to shoot down any arguments she makes.\n\nEdit: i had mine drafted to specifically exclude an ex wife as, if she doesn't remarry, she could take it to court to get some anyway.", "NTA OP.  Your mom sounds very entitled and by letting your partner inherit your share of the house, you are taking your mom down a notch.", "Well use her logic, tell her you don\u2019t want to leave it to her as she may murder you also! Done and dusted!", "NTA - your mother sounds **unhinged**. \n\n>She then said that he's going to kill me to get the whole house. \n\nI would be having some very frank conversations with her after this statement.", "NTA, I recommend you both write a will expressing the house be left to each other. When your mother decided to have a child she was deciding to raise , feed, clothe and pay for your expenses until you became an adult. It\u2019s what us parents do, if we don\u2019t want to do this we should take precautions and not put ourselves in that position. You didn\u2019t decide to be born, she decided that .

I'm not even going to get into how many people have said \"no, no, x's family would *never* do that!\" and then more than one of x's family is on the phone the day after x passes (if they're feeling particularly  polite), starting off a campaign filled with greed and callousness by dropping hints about how \"dear x would have wanted it (my) way!\"", "This stood out to me as well. Why is she doing this for him and he\u2019s not for her? I wouldn\u2019t be signing shit until his will states the same and I would make them contingent on each other that they can\u2019t be changed to screw the other person without their will also becoming null and void. Just seems unfair.", "It stood out that mom thinks that OP's partner would murder her so that they can have the whole house, even though that would change nothing about their living situation but would have the negatives of them not being with their partner and having to either hide a murder or being found guilty of murder.\n\nMeanwhile, if the mom inherited the house, she could kill OP and get a big payout and be able to afford flight school for her son. Sounds like she's the one with a motive.", "I live in the US and get a free policy that covers my kid for ~10K. I assume it's there to help with funral costs, etc. I can't imagine taking out more than that on a child. Life insurance is meant to replace lost income after death. Kids don't bring in income.", "That\u2019s what jumped out at me too. OP needs to keep one eye open when mom is around.", "I don't say this to cast stones by any means. As a 1st generation American of East-African descent, there are actually a lot of similarities with regard to respecting elders and prioritizing the care and well being of your family, but Asian culture/ideology surrounding familial obligation is... _Foreign_ to me (lol). \n\nI still remember my Korean/Japanese friend telling me at 25 y/o that he was \"not allowed to move out\", because he needs to babysit his niece; the child of his eldest brother and sister-in-law. B and SIL were just shy of 40 y/o at the time, and also residing in their parent's home.\n\nMy parents saw kicking their children out of the home at 18 as being similarly abhorrent, but encouraged us to work as soon as we were of age, and to position ourselves to be independent and fly the coop once able and ready, and under no explicit or implicit pressures. I can't fathom being completely restricted from what is arguably a valuable, formative experience of adulthood.", ">Asian families typically find \"kicking out at 18\" abhorrent.\n\nMost Westerners think the same! \n\nhttps://www.boredpanda.com/young-adults-moving-from-parents-age-data/", "It\u2019s an awful situation This is in the UK though and even here, between the nation states,legislation is different. Some parents take out a policy that pays out after a set period which may coincide with a child\u2019s birthday but the child is not the insured person. Parents can also make a claim for funds from the UK government to cover the funeral costs of a child aged under 18"]}
