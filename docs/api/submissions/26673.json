I'm more friends with the wife (42f) than I am the husband(43m), but there's a very high level of trust between all of us, to the extent that their kids even call me uncle. It's the kind of close relationship where we don't keep a lot of secrets from each other, and I've even acted as the mediator in some of their marital disputes.\n\nI don't mind being the mediator, not for most things, but recently the husband has said something to me that has me really conflicted.\n\nThey're in the process of buying a home and the husband does not like the home that his wife has selected. Due to a pre-existing arrangement, she gets to pick the house as long as it's within budget, and the house she selected comes with a large deal of property. She's had a dream her entire life of turning land into a working farm, and she's built her entire adult life around obtaining the information skills and capability to do so. Her husband does not support this dream because his mother punished him with gardening as a child. So, anything to do with being outside he automatically shuts down.\n\nThis situation has caused a lot of strife between the two of them, but, they've work things out to the point that they're both just going to go through with the process and support each other. At least, I thought so. \n\nLast week I was on the phone with the husband while the wife was out and about in town taking care of some family business, and he started to confide in me the misgivings he had. I was listening to him, because some of the concerns that he has are very valid, but at the end of the conversation he says, \"I really don't want her to succeed, and right now my greatest hope in life is that she fails in closing the deal on this property so that she can give up on this dream and I don't have to worry about it again. I'm just so tired of being accused of not supporting her dream when I've already told her why I don't like the idea, and that I would be much more comfortable with just a simple apartment for us and the kids.\" (They have 4 kids together, between 19 and 7). \n\nI was horrified that he told me this, and now I don't know what to do. If This were My partner, I'd want to know, but I also don't want to crush her hope because I think she has a real chance of pulling this deal off. They've never owned a home and she wants something that they can leave to their kids.\n\nI feel like I'm in a bit of a pickle. The wife is one of my best friends, but I don't want to say something that could wind up with them in a major dispute or potentially a divorce. I feel like I'm caught between either betraying his trust by speaking or her trust by not saying anything. And on top of that, I don't really believe in interfering with people's relationships. I thought about it for a while and I've decided that I think I just want to tell her and wash my hands of the entire situation.

Not worth the problems it would cause in their marriage.\n\nI do think you should tell him that it puts you in a weird position and encourage him to communicate better with her.", "YWBTA.

You can\u2019t get involved without meddling; they\u2019re putting you in a difficult position.", "NTA but YWBTA if you told her. Let them sort it out in their life. They are a married couple and they will sort this out.", "YWBTA if you said something to the wife. You should strongly recommend to the husband that they talk it out or get into couples counseling so the therapist can be the 'bad guy'. You mentioning anything to the wife will lead into more drama than any friendship is worth.", "NTA  \nThis is what it means to be friends with two people, especially couples. In this kind of situation, you can either distance yourself by saying 'Look, this is between the two of you, I don't want nothing to do with it' -- or to mediate. There isn't really any other option.   \n\n\nIn this case, since you've already been told something in confidence (and that is what it was) that deeply concerns your primary friend in the relationship, I'd opt for a careful approach.  \n\n\nTell the wife that you get the impression that the underlying issue regarding the property and her dream hasn't been solved at all, and that you would really suggest they talk it through once more.   \n\n\nThat way, you probably do the best for their relationship and don't betray the trust of the husband.", "Info \u2014 what is your goal & why do you feel you should be the person to tell your friend this information?", "I think the husband is not telling the full truth. According to your other comments, he may have been sabotaging all the previous attempts. Did all of those have acerage? He probably doesnt want to mow ANY lawn, not just deal with a farm. Apartment living comes without responsibility to take out the garbage bins, or mowing the lawn, or keeping the roof and paint in good repair etc. It takes specific skills and money to take care of a home. I had an uncle who had a nervous breakdown when his wife managed to buy a house after being a lifetime renter. They ended up divorced. The wife still has the house and now its worth 1.5 million. And he lives on a small pension check in a tiny apartment without any other assests. This couple will probably end up in a similar boat. She may not fail but they will probably divorce. YWBTA, but ESH anyway.", "I think you should incourage them to have a serious talk about this and share their true feelings. To him say something like \"I know it may be hard but the feeling you have shared with me have to be shared, to some extent, with your wife. Otherwise I don't think this is healthy at all. Share the whole process, you've known she always had this dream and you didn't say anything, what changed? Do you think you could be more comfortable if you got therapy or some professional help regarding these \"punishments\"? You have to talk to her because this resentment will continue to grow until you cut it from the root and talk about this\". To her I would say \"Hey! (Husband's name) seems to be a little down lately, I know he is not really into the \"outside life\" do you think it could be that? When we all talked about this he seemed pretty resistant to the idea so I think this may be affecting him more than he is sharing. Maybe have a serious talk with him and share your feelings about this to make sure you're on the same page\". Maybe suggest marriage counseling to both of them because it seems like they need it.\n\nAfter they talked I would try to see the best next step.", "Honestly, either way this couple is headed for divorce.  She wants this \"gentleman farmer\" lifestyle and he doesn't. Both of they will be unhappy. Her, because as we learned when my ex BIL had this \"dream\" it's WAY more boring, back breaking work than is expected AND when it's not the SO's dream as well they will grow resentful with picking up the slack (and financial drain). \n\nPerhaps a happy medium would be to talk to the husband and tell him he NEEDS to have this conversation with his wife for the sake of their marriage before going forward.", "NTA... whatever you do, this couple is meant to fail. They cannot communicate and can't compromise. Seems like whether you tell her or not, in the end it's going to be the same. She wants a farm, he doesn't, and one of them will be resentful.", "YWBTA\n\nUnless she wants him to be all in on the plan helping her run things. But if she is going to be doing all of the farm work and all he has to do is occasionally give a hand, say 10 minutes every other day he should suck it up and decide whether he loves his wife more than he hates farming. Keep things to yourself for now. He sounds like he will let her know even more. Now you should not add to her problems. I would instead point out to him he should be as supporting to her as he expects from her in his job. You are conflicted because  you have 2 friends with whom there is a conflict and you don't want either to be disappointed. Your help should be in talking him down and reminding him to just love his wife and maybe start to work on having his own non-farm mancave to escape to for a city-ish environment.", "YWBTA\n\nBuying a house should definitely be a 2 yes situation as it has such a huge impact on their life, finances, commute, etc.. The pre-existing agreement feels really unfair if they have such wildly different visions for their lives. I can see lots of ways they could meet half way, but that\u2019s not the role of a friend to negotiate that.\n\nIf they do really love each other and want to make it work, I\u2019d strongly recommend you suggest marriage counseling because this is way above a \u201cfriend\u2019s\u201d pay grade and you\u2019ll come out bloody whatever happens.", "YWBTA If you break confidence. This couple sounds doomed, I can see why you might want to try to help, but all you would do if you shared this is to lose two friends and get put squarely in the middle of a drama.", "YWNBTA. He definitely is though. I'm sure she already knows that he isn't in favor of her plan, but you should tell her that he straight-out said he hopes she fails. That's a messed up thing to say about your partner's dreams.", "This whole thing is none of your business.  YWBTA if you opened your mouth.", "YWBTA to yourself - stay out of it. Whatever you do or say about this issue will be thrown back at you, making you the bad guy and it will ruin your friendship with both of them.", "YWBTA, he could be venting to you and putting the worse spin on it because he trust you. Encourage him to talk to his wife and go to counselling to discuss this further", "NTA. BUT YWBTA if you got involved imo.  I kind of would stay out of it at this point.

It's not your problem and I'd recommend not getting involved at all. It's probably one of those things that will solve itself.", "NTA.  Strange that the hubby automatically assumes that not closing this particular deal will make wife's \"Dream just go away\".  Hubby can stay the heck indoors ANYWHERE.
