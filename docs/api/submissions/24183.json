All the medical people around me went over to \u201chelp\u201d him. I had to scream at them to come back over and help me birth my damn child. It was a panic attack. He got them around 3am all during my pregnancy and kept wanting me to drive him to the hospital. I refused. Guys like this always have to have it worse than anyone else.

Glad you got rid of that useless human.  Let me guess ... among other stuff that lead you to separation was that he also made the need for his care as more prevalent than to the baby's ?", "Strange. I'm not in a position to play armchair psychologist, but it seems like he's feeling some insecurities about the pregnancy. \n\nEither that or he's really not ok. When's the last time he saw a doctor?", "Tbh, my husband struggled not being my main focus of attention post pregnancy, and this may be a version of that. Doesn't make it OK, but possibly explains it.", "Last week, actually. He had a small cut that got a bit of infection on his arm. He was prescribed antibiotics, and it\u2019s pretty much healed up entirely, although he\u2019s still finishing the prescription. Him complaining predates the cut, and it\u2019s really resolving plus his doctor said he was fine beyond that so I don\u2019t think it\u2019s related.", "That makes more sense than anything I can come up with. We have a really positive relationship overall, but we are one of those couples who does most things together and are very close. I honestly have just not been up to doing things with him lately, and I\u2019ve probably not been as talkative as I normally am.", "Ok so not actually sick. It's not productive though and would drive me insane, pregnant or not. \n\nHe's being a jerk, making discomfort a competition. No one said he can't vent/complain but why does he feel the need to do it right after asking you how you are? \n\nI'd try to have a sit down and explore if he's feeling any sort of way about the pregnancy. But at the end of it, you're not the AH but he is acting like one."]}
