Glad you got rid of that useless human.  Let me guess ... among other stuff that lead you to separation was that he also made the need for his care as more prevalent than to the baby's ?", "Strange. I'm not in a position to play armchair psychologist, but it seems like he's feeling some insecurities about the pregnancy. \n\nEither that or he's really not ok.

Doesn't make it OK, but possibly explains it.", "Last week, actually. He had a small cut that got a bit of infection on his arm. He was prescribed antibiotics, and it\u2019s pretty much healed up entirely, although he\u2019s still finishing the prescription. Him complaining predates the cut, and it\u2019s really resolving plus his doctor said he was fine beyond that so I don\u2019t think it\u2019s related.", "That makes more sense than anything I can come up with.

It's not productive though and would drive me insane, pregnant or not. \n\nHe's being a jerk, making discomfort a competition. No one said he can't vent/complain but why does he feel the need to do it right after asking you how you are? \n\nI'd try to have a sit down and explore if he's feeling any sort of way about the pregnancy.

Oh I went Elevenerife! You got a headache? Oh I\u2019ve got a brain tumour! You\u2019ll never win against them sadly because they want the attention. Next time he asks answer with how are you? Then refuse to answer until he does. Maybe start telling him you\u2019re worried about him & maybe he needs to see a doctor.

Or alternatively go elsewhere. He sounds unreliable.", "Ask him how he is feeling before you talk about how you are feeling.  Let him get all of his feelings out of the way first.  If he has lots, then they are legitimate.  If he doesn\u2019t have any complaints, then just tell him you\u2019re happy he\u2019s feeling well.

If you say you are going to jump off a cliff he is going to push you out of the way and go first just to show you how it's done. Take your baby and go your separate ways, you don't need a titty baby for a spouse. Good luck with your baby.", "My husband would do that too. His night is sleep was always worse than mine. He finally stopped when I mentioned that it was odd he said he was up so much because every time I was up with the baby he was sound asleep.

You got yourself a one-upper there and those people can be real annoying. He makes it a competition then the rows back at you saying it isn\u2019t a competition. He must always be the center of attention.", "NTA start asking him first and doing it back to him lol", "NTA but I think this really is a thing, and I think he might really be suffering. Mine does the same, I hate it. I'm pregnant with our 3rd right now, in my first trimester, and I've never seen my husband so tired. He can literally fall asleep standing. I don't think it's lack of empathy, I think it's too much empathy, like he can't be well when you're suffering. Of course this is very stupid but I don't really resent him for it, although I wish it would stop.", "NTA but I can kind of get where you're both coming from. It is frustrating when you're hurting on not feeling well and he says \"same but a million times worse\". But I kind of get where he is coming from because when I had a neck injury and I was in a brace, my husband wasn't sleeping well and was waking me up to take meds so he wasn't sleeping or eating well plus having to work and it did affect his health a bit but not to that extent. He wasn't asking me about how I feel and then being like \"that sucks, but you don't know what I'm dealing with\" so I'd say talk to him and lay it out for him about how it's making you feel and how you'd really appreciate support from him instead of comparisons. But definitely NTA", "Ask him first how he is feeling and beat him at his own game.", "NTA...\nWait till your attention is totally off him and on the baby. He'll love that.", "NTA.

Get him to tell you how he's doing first.  That way he doesn't have anything to compare or compete against.\n\nIf he does ask you first, say something like, \"Oh, it's the same old stuff as it's been,\" so you're not giving him anything specific to work off of.\n\nIt may help with the immediate one-upmanship, at least.", "Your NTA. You're literally growing a whole ass human being inside of you. \n\nIf he's acting like this and your relationship was good before the pregnancy, then he's likely acting up because he's not feeling the same amount of attention he's used to getting from you. Or he's got something else going on. Either way, at this point, y'all need to have a long sit-down conversation and likely therapy before baby gets here because it's only gonna get worse. The exhaustion ain't gonna quit for a couple of years at least, and you're going to have a baby that needs a lot of attention. You need a support system, and he needs to realize it ain't gonna be all about him.", "My husband is this same way, has been the entire time. I finally made up a rule that only one of us could be sick at a time and that actually worked haha! With this pregnancy though, exactly the same thing. If I'm hurting he's worse. I finally told him \"you can let me have this, you know.\" He got the :o face. I think he didn't realize he was trying to one up a pregnant woman. He's really careful now"]}
