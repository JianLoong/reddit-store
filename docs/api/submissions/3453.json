They are probably upset cause they realize that them never/rarely visit her is why this happened.", "NTA She had her reasons, they had their opportunities. Such is life.", "NTA. Perhaps her family needs to reflect on why they didn't get the house but an outsider did ? Sometime blood does not really equal family. They left her alone and what matters is that you were there for her when she needed it. Her family could have all the reasons in the world but they did not step up to the task when she was alive.

You took care of her when it seems like nobody else in her family cared enough to do so. Where were they when she needed help? She gave you the house in her will instead of a family member for a reason. She probably saw you as a grandchild or family after everything you had voluntarily did for her that her family clearly did not. You probably filled a void that they were unwilling to fill because they were too busy with their lives to care about the one that raised them or was a part of their lives growing up. It is entirely their fault for not being more involved. Funny how her family care so much about her and her home so suddenly now that she's passed on. OP you are most definitely NTA. That house was legally yours and you let them collect items from it which in all honesty you probably didn't have to do. If they cared that much then they should have been there for her like you always were.", "NTA. The home was rightfully yours, according to the courts.

You gave them a chance  to give you an offer but they missed that chance. Also if they wish to keep the house they grew up with they could ha e talked to thier mom prior to this. My in-laws is very healthy and no where near passing, but my husband and his siblings already told them we want to keep the house (including me) we love this house and we all decided to keep it. Originally my in-laws will state that when they pass the house should be sold and split the money to thier kids. It is wierd that the old lady's kids didn't  know whats on her will. In canada parents usually sent out thier will and consult kids about it when they retire. Maybe it is just us.", "NTA there\u2019s obviously a reason she put you in her will and not them. You\u2019re the legal owner it\u2019s yours so you can do whatever you want with it.", "Oh no, you are NTA. They had every opportunity to either be there for your neighbor when she needed help, or they could have paid for her to receive help but they did NOTHING. You gave them an opportunity to make a legitimate offer on the house and they offered peanuts. You had every right to sell the house and that is exactly what your neighbor would have wanted. If she'd wanted to share the value of the house with her family she could have done that. If she'd wanted to leave her house to you and to her family so everyone could share in selling it, she could have done that. She left it to YOU, plain and simple. You're a good person to have done so much for her while she was alive, you have every right to receive the inheritance as a heart felt thank you. You took care of your neighbor and then you took care of the house with improvements. They did nothing but offer you a pittance for everything you've done. You owe them nothing and should feel justified in blocking their numbers and refusing to listen to them.", "Time for new phone numbers and email address.", "NTA.

It's not your fault they were too cheap to get it, if it was just worth 70% of the asking price to them, even though you improved it.\nblocking them and if need be take legal actions against their harassment.", "W yo o 2", "Why would you assume homophobia?", "Money. \nIf they had their own homes elsewhere it would have probably been rented out -lowball offer citing \"family rates\" /also after renovations? - bloody dreaming/ and rent it on a higher end marketing \"refurbished family home\"", "Oh, I know \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", ">filing that many would be such a pain lol, I got one restraining order and it took like 2 weeks to go through\n\nWe dont have the number of people but it likely is around 4 to 5 people. As to the tike it depends on theblawyer he gets and the judge. \n\nChanging the email is a pain with so many things now tied to it and the time it takes is actually worth it since if they violate the order they have consequences.", "I agree, I doubt \" sentimental value \" is the real reason, hard cash sounds a lot more accurate.", "My grandma gave everybody what she wanted them to have before she died, because she knew there would be fighting.\n\nI got my grandfather's funeral flag, which caused some issues needless to say.", "NTA \n\nBlock them all. There\u2019s a reason she left it to you. Namely your the only one that did anything for her when you didn\u2019t have to. Go live your best life.", "NTA.\n\nThey rejected your offer.", "Judgement:: NTA\r  \n\r  \nYou were more family to the lady then her family was.  It was willed to you to do with as you pleased. \r  \n \r  \nyou even let them come take anything that was of keep sakes, which you didn't have to do.\r  \n\r  \nYou offered them the first chance to buy it.   they didnt even come close to market value, thats on them. \r  \n\r  \nnow you have a paper trail of emails.. its time for leagal action...    I get they are hurt over the death, and the lack of being left anything, but it's still harassment.", "NTA!  I think they wanted  you to sell to them at 70% so they could turn around and sell it for market value or above.  Their mother did this for you because you cared for her and her children didn\u2019t.", "NTA. They aren't that interested. They want it cheap, to resell at a higher price. She wanted you to have it, to do with what you will. She paid for your college, she knew you wouldn't stay forever. I'm sure this was a way for you to get what you need to get your easier start!! This was her thank you.", "You are no way an AH. You were an angel to that woman and she cared deeply for you and appreciated what you did for her and that is beautiful. It\u2019s ended up rough but don\u2019t let the nastiness of these people tarnish it. Once the house is sold they will eventually give up and move on. She saw the good in her life and I only wish there were more like you out there as there would be so many less lonely people in need of some common decency.", "NTA\n\nWhere were they all these years when you were the one there to support her and keep her company.\n\nShe chose to leave it to you for a reason.", "NTA. That woman gave it to you so you can decide what to do with it", "Not just legally, but morally too - the old lady had no one it seems, other than OP to help her and look after her. Hell, OP probably spent more time in the house in the last however many years than any of the old lady's \"family\". OP has by far the better moral claim to the house.", "And rightly so!", "NTA, they tried to guilt you with the sentimental value to get it cheaper, which is pretty entitled tbh. You were fair and even put work into the house.", "NTA. You gave them the right of first refusal, which was more than you were obligated to do. If they want the house back in the family, they can try to see if your buyer will sell to them.", "You seem to have been more family to her than those who shared her DNA, you deserve whatever she chose to give you, and it's your's to do what you want with it. They wanted to screw you over. NTA", "NTA.  You are a good person.  It seems like you showed more care and concern for your neighbor than her own family did.", "Technically, NTA.  You could have predicted the outcome, though, so it's really hard to get sympathy for now receiving harassing emails.  You were well within your rights to sell the home at market value, and presumably, if it was so very important that a family member own it, they would have paid market value.  However, when you've been given a year of free college tuition and a free house, may have made sense to analyze the hidden costs before selling.  In other words, if you are thinking you might have been an a-hole and are living with some guilt, and you are now being harassed, was it worth the 30%?  Sometimes, peace of mind and conflict-free living does actually have a value worth paying.", "I wish more people would give to people who actually care for them instead of whoever is blood", "Change your email. \n\nNTA", "Why do you care what the family thinks?", "I guess that's true,", "NTA.\n\nWhere were they when she needed them?? The NOIVE of some peoples!!", "NTA .. Go do what this sweet lady wanted you to do. She purposefully gave you a jumpstart on life.", "NTA.\n\nThe lady gave it to YOU because you spent time with her, her family did not. It's yours to do as you please with.\n\nI think it was very nice of you to offer them to get keepsakes out and to give them priority in buying. It's also totally acceptable to sell to someone else if the family isn't able to match what you're asking (I hope you let them know what you want or what the other person is offering before selling, not that you were obligated). You did what you could for them, the rest is on them.\n\nIt's time people learn they're not owed anything from relatives if they're not willing to treat them well while they live.", "Why is it the ones that do the least always want the most?", "NTA.  They offered 70% and someone else offered 100%.  You would have been an AH to yourself if you shorted 30% of the money.", "There is a reason that lady did what she did for you\n\nYou were there for her.  Her family was not\n\nMy advice?\n\nChange your email address and move on with your life\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nIt's pretty clear why she left you the house. You gave her time, effort, and love her family didn't.", "NTA - It was left to you for a reason. Nowhere in your write up do you mention where the family stopped over to help with things around the house or visit her. My guess is that they didn't. Once a week phone calls perhaps? She left it to you, the court agrees, and you should not feel any guilt about the sale. My guess is that they would just flip the house anyway. Bring a piece of that home with you to your new house as a way to remember this kind old lady who enjoyed your companionship over the years.", "So they were aware you had higher offers and they chose not to raise their offer?  And that you were willing to take asking price only, shorting yourself some money?  Wow, you are SOOOOOO NTA.", "Exactly that will was made when she was of sound mind with a lawyer. Maybe if her family actually spent time with her like OP they would've got the house. Now theyre acting like money grabbing narcissists. NTA"]}
