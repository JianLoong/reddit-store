Eventually I realized how lonely she was so I would often go to her house and spend time with her since her actual family lived far away.\n\nTowards the end of high school she started losing it. Her memory got worse and she\u2019d forget things. I felt bad accepting money and started making up excuses and would lie to get out of her paying me. I think she realized I was avoiding her payments and felt bad. At the end of my senior year she wrote me a check for my college tuition. Keep in mind my tuition was close to 25k a year and she paid for a full year. I tried to not accept the gift but she insisted that I accept. After I went to college she hired a caregiver and didn\u2019t really need me but I still tried to visit.\n\nWell this year she died and I was on her will. She gave me her home and some money.

But in the end\u2026 you were lowballed on their offer. You sold the house to someone who offered a better price.\n\nEDIT: If they continue to contact you about the house and whatnot, take legal action; they are harassing you.", "NTA. There were reasons why it was kept to you and not her \"family.\" You were more her family than they were. They are probably upset cause they realize that them never/rarely visit her is why this happened.", "NTA She had her reasons, they had their opportunities. Such is life.", "NTA. Perhaps her family needs to reflect on why they didn't get the house but an outsider did ? Sometime blood does not really equal family. They left her alone and what matters is that you were there for her when she needed it. Her family could have all the reasons in the world but they did not step up to the task when she was alive. The house is yours and you do what you want with it.", "NTA: If they visited/helped she would've left them the house.", "NTA\n\nIt's easier for them to blame you than blame their relative so that's what's happening. You're under no obligation to accommodate their spite and jealousy. Maybe if they were better people and cared as much about their relative when they were alive and there wasn't an estate on the line this wouldn't have been an issue.", "NTA\n\n\nSet uo6abs auto reply:\n\nIf you'd taken the time to care for grandma when she was alive we wouldn't be in this position now.\n\nYou only have yourself to blame.", "They had to have been pretty crappy for her to change the will and give the house to you.

Regardless it was her money and possessions to do with what she wanted. You two obviously developed a bond throughout the years and cared for one another, otherwise you wouldn't do the things you did and same for her. You might not even realize how much everything, even just your company meant to her.\n\nReminds me of the movie Gran Torino.", "NTA - She gifted that house to you in her will. There is nothing they can do about it. And if they had played fair and gave you a reasonable offer, you would have sold it to them.

Your house, you can do what you want with it.  If they wanted it so badly they would have not tried to rip you off on the price.", "NTA. You took care of her when it seems like nobody else in her family cared enough to do so. Where were they when she needed help? She gave you the house in her will instead of a family member for a reason. She probably saw you as a grandchild or family after everything you had voluntarily did for her that her family clearly did not. You probably filled a void that they were unwilling to fill because they were too busy with their lives to care about the one that raised them or was a part of their lives growing up. It is entirely their fault for not being more involved. Funny how her family care so much about her and her home so suddenly now that she's passed on. OP you are most definitely NTA. That house was legally yours and you let them collect items from it which in all honesty you probably didn't have to do. If they cared that much then they should have been there for her like you always were.", "NTA. The home was rightfully yours, according to the courts. It would be ridiculous for you to pass up a good career opportunity, or take it and not use the house. You gave the family first dibs on the house, and they lowballed you. \n\nThey are harassing you - file a police report.", "NTA they didn\u2019t care when their mom was elderly and alone\u2026 however, it may be more financially sound to keep the house and rent it through a rental agency than to sell it, especially with the housing market the way it is. That is an asset.", "NTA, I think you were very sweet to that old nice lady. You also did not take advantage of her which makes you such a good person. You gave them a chance  to give you an offer but they missed that chance. Also if they wish to keep the house they grew up with they could ha e talked to thier mom prior to this. My in-laws is very healthy and no where near passing, but my husband and his siblings already told them we want to keep the house (including me) we love this house and we all decided to keep it. Originally my in-laws will state that when they pass the house should be sold and split the money to thier kids. It is wierd that the old lady's kids didn't  know whats on her will. In canada parents usually sent out thier will and consult kids about it when they retire. Maybe it is just us.", "NTA there\u2019s obviously a reason she put you in her will and not them. You\u2019re the legal owner it\u2019s yours so you can do whatever you want with it.", "Oh no, you are NTA. They had every opportunity to either be there for your neighbor when she needed help, or they could have paid for her to receive help but they did NOTHING. You gave them an opportunity to make a legitimate offer on the house and they offered peanuts. You had every right to sell the house and that is exactly what your neighbor would have wanted. If she'd wanted to share the value of the house with her family she could have done that. If she'd wanted to leave her house to you and to her family so everyone could share in selling it, she could have done that. She left it to YOU, plain and simple. You're a good person to have done so much for her while she was alive, you have every right to receive the inheritance as a heart felt thank you. You took care of your neighbor and then you took care of the house with improvements. They did nothing but offer you a pittance for everything you've done. You owe them nothing and should feel justified in blocking their numbers and refusing to listen to them.", "Time for new phone numbers and email address.", "NTA. Your interactions and responses were fair bordering on generous. That they thought they could get by with a low-ball offer is on them. Time to block email addresses and phone numbers. You've done nothing wrong.", "Nta. G.g. had 3 grandkids. My husband got the house and 1/5 of the inheritance because he came around to help her. We spent the most time with her of all the grandkids. Even more when we had her great grand child. \n\nThe other 2 only came over for Thanksgiving and Christmas. Never called on her birthday.

I can understand people missing their childhood home, but let's face it, property isn't something that necessarily stays within a family. My childhood home was sold years ago when my parents retired. /shrug. It's not realistic to expect someone to sell a house way under market value just because you want them to. What would they do if she had to sell it to pay for care? It'd still be gone. \n\nThe house was given to you to do as you wish - I suspect she really didn't want it to go to her graspy relatives.

Ask them where they have been and why they didn\u2019t pay her any attention, but they expect to inherit everything she has?", "NTA you basically cared for their mother in her senior years.

You did the right thing.\n\nAlso, don't put stock in whatever they say to you. Inheritances bring out the worst in even the best people. Grief and greed make for a nightmarish combination.\n\nHold your ground. Consider legal action for a cease-and-desist if you feel you have to.\n\nYou became an important friend, not a \"rando\".

Sure, you weren't a blood relative, but you still maintained a close relationship with this woman for 13 years.

Maybe they were taken aback by it, but it's not actually that unusual a thing she's done!", "Ngl, I never feel bad for these kinds of situations. Because where were they when she was in her dying years? Where were they on her will? Clearly they were not people of value to her to leave anything to them.

Why do you even bother to bring up turning down her money? Unless you're detailing not needing it? You mention you were wary of taking her money because she was losing it, but the value of the house was enough to make you blind to that?", "If there was sentimental value, it doesn't look like they valued it all that much before the lady's death.\n\nNTA, OP was the one who was there for her when she needed it.", "Wonderfully stated and very true.", "There's no evidence that she \"changed\" her will.

Even OP offering to sell to the family at asking price, without making them bid for it against other offers, was generous. He helped maintain her house for over a DECADE for what was a bit more than an allowance, then for free once he could tell her mental faculties were declining. More importantly, he kept her, and the the house, company. When people get old and lonely, things start falling apart.
