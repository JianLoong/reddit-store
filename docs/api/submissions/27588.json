{"id": 27588, "submission_id": "16rr5uk", "title": "AITA for calling my mom out for not being fully honest about the reason she wants her husband to walk me down the aisle at my wedding?", "selftext": "My wedding is coming up and my mom has been campaigning hard for her husband, my stepdad, to be the person to walk me down the aisle. I already asked my paternal grandparents. My mom knew I was going to ask them and knew when I had. But she has not given up on the desire for me to ask her husband. The other day she told me that it would make the most sense and she feels like he is the correct and most worthy person to walk me down the aisle. I called her out on that and said she should be more honest about why she wants him. The reason, I know, is because she knows her husband and my dad hated each other and she believes I should have been loyal to her husband over my dad. She especially believes I should have given all the loyalty I had to my dad to her husband after I lost my dad at the age of 7.\n\nBG: My parents broke up (never married) and my mom got married to her husband when I was 2. My dad and her husband hated each other. I was always aware of the fact. But it became especially bitter for me when I was 6 and my dad was diagnosed with cancer. I don't remember a lot from that time. But I do remember my mom's husband showing up to see my dad when he was in the hospital and I remember him yelling at my dad. I know prior to that the two were as bad as each other and the animosity was mutual. When my dad died I didn't automatically start to care more or feel closer to her husband. He did try and I think part of his hatred for my dad was I was such a daddy's girl and never looked at him being in my life as having two. I spent equal time with both my parents when dad was alive. \n\nI never got closer to my mom's husband. He was my mom's husband and my half siblings dad but even though I don't remember a time where I didn't know him, I never saw him as my dad. He always hated my dad too. I heard him grumble about him over the years. Even saw him spit near a photo of my dad once. Eventually he gave up trying and decided I wasn't worth his time, which I felt was better for everyone.\n\nBut my mom hates it. She hates that he's just her husband and I haven't embraced him as my dad. One time she said it can be so hurtful to lose to a dead man and be rejected in favor of a dead man. I asked what she meant by that and she told me I never picked her husband over my dad and I never let him feel like he won against him in one thing. I told her he had; he was still alive while my dad was gone.\n\nI think my mom still wants that win for her husband, especially when his hatred for my dad still burns strong. I believe my paternal grandparents are the right people to walk me. I have been close to them my entire life. \n\nMy mom is mad that I called her out and tried to make her be honest. She said she was not lying and I was being rude.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1695646199, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16rr5uk/aita_for_calling_my_mom_out_for_not_being_fully/", "score": 6373, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

My mom immediately remarried, and my stepdad tried to adopt me. My dad got screwed by lawyers because it was back in the day when the mom just got custody and child/spouse support. They hated my dad, and always treated him like shit and me like shit. Back then phones were wired, so I had to have talks in the kitchen where they\u2019d laugh and make fun of me/him. We also moved out of state and across the country (multiple times) against court orders, and then forced my dad to pay for visitation flights. They also divorced on paper so that my mom could take my dad to court for more money when she found out he\u2019d gotten a sizeable raise after a promotion. \n\nI say all that not because my dad was perfect. I ended up moving out from my moms and going to live with my dad as a teen. We fought constantly because I realized how controlling, manipulative, and stubborn he was. My stepdad wasn\u2019t perfect either, he physically abused me and I also watched him get busted with a jumbo sized bale of weed in the trunk of his car (not judging weed, but again, long ago it was illegal everywhere). This scenario sounds a lot like what I went through. As a kid I idolized my dad because of how mean they were to him and me. I would be genuinely interested if OP has had \u2018the talk\u2019 about why their relationship failed. Now, obviously OP\u2019s dad can\u2019t defend himself, but her mom\u2019s side would probably be pretty telling.

I watched Saturday cartoons with him Pok\u00e9mon and yugioh and fucking power rangers omfg how many power Rangers movies and series I have watched with my son. First ball games, baseball, basketball, and football. Movies by the dozens. Learned how to play the yugioh and Pok\u00e9mon card games. Taught him math and read to him each night. Slept in his room when he had nightmares. Held him while he cried, missing his dad. I taught him to play baseball and basketball and went to a kid I hated in school and had him teach me how to throw a football and the rules so I could teach him that. I would spend hours on the phone with his father, trying to get him to visit his boy. I went to this man's house beat the shit out of him handed him money and a birthday card and threatened to kill him if he didn't show up to his sons birth sober on time with the card and a gift. Then, he handed him a list with 8 things on it, and I told him to pick 2, spend the hundred, and keep the change. His dad was a real piece of shit . I would pay for their activities if he would show up and spend time with his son. You should of seen that boys eyes when that man would walked into a room. The joy you could see on his face, I wanted him to feel like that all the time. My son is 30 now. I stopped paying his dad to visit him when he was 13 his dad had drugs in the house, cops busted him while my son was there, and we almost lost him. To this day, he calls me by my first name. It doesn't matter how many times I have dropped everything to come to the rescue. How much I love him. He just sees me as the reason his dad wasn't around. I didn't know my wife when they were together it was 2 years in between them breaking up and her meeting me. After my son turned 5, if I didn't force and bribe him, my son would never have met his father. A few years back, my son stopped communicating with his dad because his dad spilled the beans jealous and angry, thinking I was trying to steal his son. He started shouting all the horrible things I did to make sure my son saw his dad at least once a month. The jobs I got the man the money I gave the birthday reminders pulling him out of bars paying for his rehab twice. This man thought I had told my son I had to force his dad to show up on birthdays. So he laid it all out. This man laid it out. How I was horrible for telling him about it. How I was the bad guy for trying to turn my son against him. My son looked at him and told him the lie I told my son every time he cried for his dad. I told him, \"He loves you and wishes more than anything he could be here with you. He still loves your mom too, but things are crazy for him right now, and he can't. He loves you so much he would do anything he could to be here, but it's just not possible.\" I love my son as much as my bio children, and because of the issue with his dad, I prolly spent more time on him than them, but I felt bad he had such a shitty father. He is 30 now and knows everything. Truth is I am just his mothers husband. I'm still not his dad, but he is my son which is still fine with me. When I married his mom, her child became mine. It doesn't bother me that I am not his Dad. It wouldn't bother me if he still thought his dad hung the moon. Your step dad could be the best dad you ever had. Maybe not who knows. So before you turn someone away, make sure you know the truth. I can't say that my heart hasn't been broken many times by him, though. When I worked so hard to try to make sure the boy had me and his real father in his life . Make sure you have the truth. You may only be married once.

I already asked my paternal grandparents. My mom knew I was going to ask them and knew when I had. But she has not given up on the desire for me to ask her husband. The other day she told me that it would make the most sense and she feels like he is the correct and most worthy person to walk me down the aisle. I called her out on that and said she should be more honest about why she wants him. The reason, I know, is because she knows her husband and my dad hated each other and she believes I should have been loyal to her husband over my dad. She especially believes I should have given all the loyalty I had to my dad to her husband after I lost my dad at the age of 7.\n\nBG: My parents broke up (never married) and my mom got married to her husband when I was 2. My dad and her husband hated each other. I was always aware of the fact. But it became especially bitter for me when I was 6 and my dad was diagnosed with cancer. I don't remember a lot from that time. But I do remember my mom's husband showing up to see my dad when he was in the hospital and I remember him yelling at my dad. I know prior to that the two were as bad as each other and the animosity was mutual. When my dad died I didn't automatically start to care more or feel closer to her husband. He did try and I think part of his hatred for my dad was I was such a daddy's girl and never looked at him being in my life as having two. I spent equal time with both my parents when dad was alive. \n\nI never got closer to my mom's husband. He was my mom's husband and my half siblings dad but even though I don't remember a time where I didn't know him, I never saw him as my dad. He always hated my dad too. I heard him grumble about him over the years. Even saw him spit near a photo of my dad once. Eventually he gave up trying and decided I wasn't worth his time, which I felt was better for everyone.\n\nBut my mom hates it. She hates that he's just her husband and I haven't embraced him as my dad. One time she said it can be so hurtful to lose to a dead man and be rejected in favor of a dead man. I asked what she meant by that and she told me I never picked her husband over my dad and I never let him feel like he won against him in one thing. I told her he had; he was still alive while my dad was gone.\n\nI think my mom still wants that win for her husband, especially when his hatred for my dad still burns strong. I believe my paternal grandparents are the right people to walk me. I have been close to them my entire life. \n\nMy mom is mad that I called her out and tried to make her be honest. She said she was not lying and I was being rude.\n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Also, you should attach a small photo of your dad to your bouquet, so he can be with you in spirit. \n\nCongratulations on your wedding, OP. \ud83d\ude0a", "So just sit there and smile and pretend you step dad never said anything bad against your dad?  All step dad had to do was shut the fuck up about it.", "Don\u2019t even discuss it with her. You don\u2019t have to invite either of them. I would definitely exclude him. If mom can behave, maybe let her come alone.", "I think it's worth mentioning that an insult against your dad can feel like an insult against you as well, especially as a kid. Like you probably got compared to your dad in some ways (you have his nose, eyes, hair, or whatever) and half of your DNA is his. So to hear that this person whom you may love and who shares traits with you is (insert insults here) can kind of feel like it's partly about you, too.\n\nI feel like the first rule of divorce when you have kids is not talking shit about their other parent, and it sounds like mom and step-dad both missed the memo. He was focusing on his anger at your dad and some imagined competition, not on what was best for you. If he's \"losing to a dead man,\" then it's his fault for competing against him in the first place instead of focusing on what you needed since he was supposed to be your stepPARENT.", "Say that again? What kind of bs is that? Why is she enabling his hate for your dad? Why couldn't he let go of that after so many years after your dad's death?\n\nYou are absolutely right, don't give in.", "Your mom should grasp that Step used his hatred as a weapon against you, and caused you great pain as a child.  Kids do NOT forget such things.  He literally acted like the loss of your dad was a good thing, so he should be applauded for living and offering to take the job.  That's the biggest dick move anyone can do to a child mourning a beloved parent.  If he actually CARED about you, he'd have swallowed his hatred for your sake; instead, he used his hatred of a dead man to torture you.  You are not required to ever forgive him for such actions toward a child.", "So it's perfectly fine for her husband to act however he wants, continuing to hold onto anger at someone who died years ago, and still being so petty that they want to \"win\" over a dead man but your the one who is the problem here? The kind of brain gymnastics to make you the issue is insane. \n\nThese two are giving narcissistic vibes.

I would consider the persistent incidents you witnessed over the years to be Parental Alienation, which is classified as Child Abuse on many jurisdictions. This is because kids know that they get traits and qualities from each parent, so if one parent says the other one is X, Y & Z negative things, the child can internalize that negativity. The fact that your dad has been dead and your mother and her husband have been trying for years to get you to give up on your dad's memory and your love for him could have easily given you significant issues with self esteem and self worth. \n\nI think you should tell them that you will consider changing the relationship if your father forgives your mother's husband for screaming at him on his death bed. Oh, that's an impossible request? Well, there's your answer! Some choices are permanent.", "You notice all this, but put the blame solely on the step-dad. You can clearly see OP has provided selected information to say step-dad is a bad guy but hasn't been bad to her. It's sad when kids behave this way, turning away over a false perception that they nurse for decades. \n\nIts really sad because the parent doesn't have a choice on whether to be invested. They can't say that this kid is showing me nothing but contempt, I'm going to abandon them. But that's all the stepdad got even after decades of support. \n\nAs a 7 year old I can understand OP being standoffish, but she is an adult now, and acting like a child. Not in the walking down the aisle thing, but in completely refusing to acknowledge this guy who raised her as anything but some guy her mom married.", "To be fair, we do not know why he yelled at the dad.", "With how callous and petty this guy sounds, I\u2019m almost wondering if this guy hated her dad bc he didn\u2019t get to use a tax credit/deduction", "This is exactly it.

How is OP\u2019s perception a false one? Her stepdad clearly had an issue with her father for some undisclosed reason. No matter his feelings, he should have kept them in check when around OP. And definitely should not have done things like grumble about her dad or and spit in the direction of a photo of him. All these things are a part of being an adult, choosing a mature response at all times around children, who are very impressionable. \n\nAnd no, the stepparent can always choose to be invested, whether or not the child is receptive to that investment. It\u2019s not as though the child chose to be put on this world, and if the step-parent wants to be with their mother \u2013 they knew what they were getting into. It\u2019s not as though the child was a secret when they were dating. \n\nMy husband has been in my children\u2019s lives since my youngest was 2 and eldest was 4.

Every time I read these stories about a step-parent being upset because they\u2019re not called \u201cdad\u201d or \u201cmom\u201d I have to wonder if the step-parent ever supported their autonomy. \n\nMy point is - it\u2019s the child\u2019s choice on how they choose to acknowledge their step-parent - and nobody else\u2019s.", "Its pretty alright but if you have problems reading comprehending I recomend any low Level english classes.

My stepdaughter from my first marriage calls my husband \u201cDad\u201d and her father as \u201csperm-donor\u201d. \n\nThe issue is that OP needed to figure out who her father was on her own terms\u2014and she didn\u2019t get the chance to bc he was taken from her at such a young age. And while her father may have been a bad partner to her mother, a bad partner isn\u2019t necessarily a bad PARENT. The child should not have had to witness adults berating and cussing her beloved parent. Especially while he was at the hospital DYING.

He was hurting his stepdaughter, who would have to live with that terrible memory for all of her days. \n\nAll of you behaved like petulant children and not one of you considered the ACTUAL child.
