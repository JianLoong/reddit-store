Weird friends. OP is NTA.", "NTA.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nJohn does sound like a wankstain. He sounds incredibly entitled, childish, and emotionally unstable.

That\u2019s a big fact of human nature: Not a lot of people want to be called on being assholes. They\u2019d prefer to do their assholishness in the dark and cover it up with fancy words.

But, if you do, your partner needs to understand that in relationships, you're each responsible for keeping your own friends and family in check.  It's *his* job to call John a.wankstsin when he's being a wankstain.  If he won't do that, you know this relationship is going nowhere.", "\"*My partner thinks it was funny*..\"  I agree with your partner.

You did nothing wrong. John needs to pull up his big boy pants and grow the hell up.", "NTA \n\nYou\u2019re right he is one and TA.

His so called \"best friend\" has absolutely no respect for you or your relationship whatsoever and it shows.
