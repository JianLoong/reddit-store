I wonder how he got to have such an unrealistic set of perceptions and expectations. You\u2019ve gotta start treating this guy like an adult, and that means communicating with him when he behaves unacceptably.

This needs to be a sit down meeting with all the flatmates. All of you need to find a time where everyone can sit down together share experiencing frustrations of living together with each other and set up living together rules like cleaning rotation, fine for if you're not pulling your weight, allowances for not pulling your weight like if you're really sick and you need to keep your room so you don't get anyone else sick yeah obviously we don't want you cleaning the kitchen right now. This will help clear the air with everyone get frustrations out be open and honest with everyone. And give you all a chance to write up a flatmate agreement. Cover things like having visitors over responsible for their visitors behavior and any cleaning or damages they might have also how long somebody is a visitor and when it turns into they've moved in even if they don't bring their stuff and talk about the financial issues associated with that. Write it all up get everybody to sign it everybody gets a copy keep a copy electronically as well and stick to it. If once a year one of your flatmates asks you hey I'm not feeling great I've got a important trip in the morning can you make sure that I'm up. I mean once in awhile rare events totally fine but more than once or twice a year oh heck no. And the whole skid marks and other stuff that just needs to stop. I understand you guys have been polite about not confronting but if you're having a sit-down discussion and everybody's being open and honest this is the time to bring this stuff up. Get it all out in the air get rid of all the frustrations by writing up an agreement that everybody's on the same page for.", "NTA.\n\nTell him you are not responsible for waking him up ahead of time, then let the chips fall where they may.\n\nAlso, if I were you, I'd start putting the trash he leaves around the flat on his bed. :)", "NTA, not your kid, not your responsibility.", "NTA. As you said you\u2019re  not his mother.

To be clear, you wouldn't be TA if you did it and it would definitely drive the point home, but if he's going to fail a subject as a result I'd personally choose a different day.", "NTA, but you and your flatmates need to sit down and have an adult conversation about responsibility and courtesy. He needs to start taking responsibility for his own actions, and you need to stop enabling his irresponsible behaviors. \n\nOne suggestion would be that you all sit down calmly and discuss guidelines for keeping common areas clean, picking up after yourselves daily, and a rota for weekly cleaning so that everyone can weigh in on expectations. Make sure to discuss the issues without making direct accusations. Regardless of who is at fault, unhygienic living conditions are an issue. So, discuss how to keep the flat nice rather than calling out individuals for their faults. \n\nAgreeing on consequences for anyone not honoring the agreement might impress upon  everyone how frustrating that kind of behavior is. If you go this route, it would be wise to put the agreement in writing and have everyone sign.", "NTA, he's 25 not 5.

If you at to afraid to \u2019upset\u2019 a roommate, how are you ever going to function at a job where you have to stand up for yourself?\n\nStop being their mother.  Or you are looking at your foreseeable future, and you will be the one allowing it.", "Y T A if you wake him up and enable him to keep acting like a child. Get some earplugs or something to sleep through it. If that doesn\u2019t work, turn off his alarm after 15 minutes, or at least turn it down, and go back to bed - don\u2019t wake him up. Ridiculous that he\u2019ll keep everyone in a four bedroom apartment awake instead of taking responsibility for his own actions. But also inform him that you will do all this and NOT wake him up no matter what. He can wake up on his own or he can fail the final", "NTA. I\u2019m so confused how he\u2019s made it this far along in life.", "NTA especially since you have the opportunity to sleep a bit longer.  \n\nUgh you\u2019re not his mommy and he needs to stop thinking of you that way. He needs to figure this out bc it\u2019s pathetic a 25 year old can\u2019t get up on his own. If he\u2019s using his phone as an alarm then he should get a real alarm clock and maybe one that vibrates or something. There are options and you and your other roommates shouldn\u2019t be one on them.", "NTA i spent years being woken up early by my father doing this and then later my husband and now my kid. I hate it. I\u2019m tired of being woken up early by someone\u2019s alarm going off and them not getting up.  My mom used to try all morning to get my dad up and then be berated by him for hours later.  I told my husband flat out i was not going to wake him up and I finally told him to stop setting the alarm if he wasn\u2019t going to get up anyway.  Now he only asks me to make sure he\u2019s up on rare occasions when something is very important and I\u2019m happy to help if I\u2019m already going to be up at that time.", "nta", "NTA he is a grown man.", "OP, you need to say, \"I'm not your mom. None of us is your parent. Go to bed at a decent time, so you can get up at a decent time, and we don't have to listen to your alarm going off for hours. Regardless, if your alarm is going off from now on, I'm shutting it off, and not waking you, so keep that in mind.\"", "You heard the alarm and fell asleep again.

Grim. NTA.", "You helped create this monster, and now you have to do the work of getting this burden off your back. If his alarm wakes you and not him, you may as well go into his room and turn it off.", "NTA, of course. Seriously, I'd sneak in and turn down the alarm before it goes off so your sleep isn't disturbed. You're just as entitled to quiet tidy living as he is, and you're letting him use your fear of confrontation to his advantage. Pretend he's a dog you're trying to train - be consistent and push his shit back on him every single time.", "NTA while I agree with folks saying not to wake him, it'd be infinitely funnier to wake him in outrageous ways. Throw balloons filled with hot sauce at him, just go into his room and blare cbat song, sit on the bed next to him and delete his game files loudly til he wakes up", "NTA \n\nWhy are there so many stories of grown ass men needing to be tucked in and woken up by someone else because they're not mature enough to handle their own shit? Howre their parents fucking up so badly?", "I would have a sudden urgent need to be somewhere else from about 30 minutes before his alarm goes off. \u201cOh, I wanted to get a big breakfast before I gave blood, I left the house at 6\u201d kind of thing. Take the other two guys with you. \n\nNTA", "I\u2019d be worse, I\u2019d shut it off and go back to bed.", "Nta.

NEVER DO THIS AGAIN. \"I am not your mommy!\" The age this stops for children is early teens. There is a reason this boy doesnt clean up after himself- he wasnt raised right. \nStop cleaning up after him too. Yikes. I am sorry for any future gf.", "Why is he still your roommate?", "NTA\n\nYou have told him you won't do it.  He can try the radical approach of going to sleep before midnight if he wants to get up at 7\n\nWho knows? It might even work. .", "NTA.\nYou and the other roommates need to stop being 'subtle' with the overgrown infant. His being touchy and easily offended is manipulative.  He's bullying you all into not calling him on his nonsense.Tell him straight up that he is responsible for himself and you guys are not his mommy and daddy. He needs to clean up behind himelf etc or he'll be looking for a new home. Give him an ultimatum and stick to it.", "NTA. Part of being a grown up is the ability to manage your day/time. He\u2019s responsible for waking himself up on time. Not you.", "From my personal experience I would say NTA. Im 26M working as a head chef but I also love to game and hang with my friends. So sometimes I ask a collegue of mine to wake me up if I'm working the evening shift until 23:00 and plan to play with my friends until 02/03:00 but I have to be up at 07:00. i mean we really are good colleagues and she is working as my sous so I asked her nicely if she could do it. Try to discuss with your friend to be a bit more polite.", "NTA \n\nI would say that you are beginning a $100 wake-up fee that needs to be paid in advance. Cash only.", "NOPE!

When he shows it to you point out that you are not his mother and not your job or responsibility to wake him or clean up after him since he\u2019s a grown adult.", "NTA.  But tell him.  Say that you know him well enough to know that he will set a loud alarm in order to try to force you to get up but that you are done with his crap and you will never get him up ever again under any circumstance.  Then it is his call if he wants to still take the chance.", "NTA if you TELL him. In fact why didn't you tell him you would not wake him up when he asked you?\n\nBut if you don't let him know then YTA as this would be deliberately sabotaging his results.", "Along the same lines - so he's easily offended? Fine. Offend him, OP. Again and again. For as long as his offensive conduct lasts. NTA.", "Unlikely. It will be OPs fault because he told her he needs to be up by then. He has skillfully already made OP the scapegoat for his oversleeping and trained you to not argue because it upsets him.\n\nYou need to have a conversation with him whether he gets mad or jot. You are not an alarm clock, his maid or his mom. If he needs to be looked after to that degree, he should consider moving back in with her.\n\nIf he gets upset, he gets upset,  but you have to stick to it.

Maybe in the future we'll have recovery groups for Social Media Addicts and Video Game Addicts.", "I really don't get this kind of people. I'm a very heavy sleeper (I was tossed from my bed during an earthquake and didn't wake up), and I sometimes mess up my schedule during exams or otherwise busy times.

He's an adult, he should be able to deal with it", "I am also a very heavy sleeper and I don't even hear alarms. Literally would sleep through fire alarms in college.

Also, you all are enabling his behavior by putting up with it.", "NTA as a Genshin Impact addict (Genshin is a popular game if you don't know), if I'm up late playing, I get myself up because no one will do that for me.

Would be awesome if you could find somewhere else to bunk for the night, lol, and wave buh-bye as you go out the door.", "NTA and good for you on finally setting hard boundaries and not enabling this person. I say person because a grown man takes responsibility for himself by getting up when his alarm goes off or at least excepting the fallout for being late.

Almost all of mine are fasting so I just assume it will be. But I\u2019m also older than a college student.", "But I bet that you politely ask them to help you, and wouldn't throw a tantrum if they said no.

He\u2019s a grown ass am. Also how do you leave skid marks on a toilet. That\u2019s some nasty right there. \n\nGet him an Alexa for his room and then and for the rest of the house. Then sign in on your phone. When his alarm goes off you can turn it off from the privacy of your room and he can learn to be an adult who doesn\u2019t need his mommy to wake him up. \n\nAlso tell the other jerks you live with to stop making you take care of him because you have lady parts.
