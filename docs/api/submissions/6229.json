I also don\u2019t really feel ready for a child at all. \n\nMy view is that I don\u2019t want to have a child before knowing that I can properly provide for them. I also know if she were to get pregnant quickly, I would feel a crazy amount of pressure and stress due to our current financial position. \n\nMy wife completely blew up at me for this and said it meant I wasn\u2019t serious about our relationship and \u201cwhat\u2019s the point in being married then?\u201d.

You\u2019ve been married for 5 years and she\u2019s already 35, it\u2019s only natural that since you both agreed you wanted kids in the future, she would think the time is approaching. There will always be financial stress and pressures, unless you\u2019re rich, so while I believe that you think that\u2019s a good reason not to, it\u2019s understandable she disagrees. If you don\u2019t want kids, you need to be straight with her because the older a woman is, the riskier a pregnancy is for her and the child, and also the chances of getting pregnant naturally diminishes a lot (imagine the financial strain of having to do a fertility treatment).", "YTA. 7.5 years is a long ass time to wait. Do you understand her time is literally limited? Stop stringing her along ffs.", "INFO What kind of debt are you concerned about, and how bad is the financial situation? Bad enough that mat leave could leave you homeless and you wouldn't be able to feed yourselves if there are pregnancy complications?", "Her perspective as a female 35 is getting to the high risk area. Wait awhile but it\u2019s been 7.5 years. Like someone else mentioned it. Hold take a year to get pregnant than 9 mos for baby. Ow your talking about 37 on her age . You guys need to sit down and talk about it calmly. No one is ever perfectly ready for a baby.", "Just as a headsup...\n\nI turned 35 in June, I was due in August. Geriatric pregnancy, including needing a high risk consult and extra ultrasounds (there was some other going on as well, so I personally would have had to have the consult anyway).\n\nYall have officially waited long enough that any pregnancy will likely involve extra appointments and testing. Not saying it's a bad thing, just that it **is** a 'thing'. The more you wait from this point the more the risks for both mother and baby start increasing. If yall wanted more than one... yea. \n\nShe's not being unreasonable. She's been waiting for it to be 'time' for almost 8 years and has hit the point that whatever scale of risk/benefit she's using says it's time for a baby. \n\nYou're also not being unreasonable, really, but really should actually look in to geriatric pregnancy and the risks of older parents. \n\nAnd then yall need to decide your deadlines and limits. If you start trying in a year but like many people take another year to conceive, will that screw the timeline for potential second children? Would that pushing 3 years for a baby be a worse scenario than starting now and getting pregnant immediately? Etc. \n\nRight now tho... it just sounds like you both assumed you'd be the one deciding when 'now' was. NAH, but you need to have a real convo and figure it out.", "INFO: Do you think biologically that your wife can afford to wait until you're financially stable to have kids?", "NAH - I applaud you for being reflective and not wanting to parent if you're not ready. Maybe you guys could freeze some of her eggs or embryos? That would be added financial stress though. \n\nYou can focus on paying off debt together in a very structured way, but your wife is right to be concerned about fertility. While you're paying off debt, the two of you could learn more about fertility, highlights of pregnancy (at least things to expect!), child development ages & stages, and positive parenting. \n\nI taught elementary school and led parenting classes before I had kids. Haha I didn't feel ready and the whole world looked different when we drove our first baby home from the hospital. That's actually how I chose my name here. I love the song and I played it a lot in those early months. \n\nBeing debt free is awesome. But I can promise, the dishwasher's gonna break down, one of you will have a fender bender, or a windstorm will blow away part of your roof. Who knows? Then there will be diapers, maybe formula, clothes, and when they go to school - oh my! The point is, there's always gonna be something. I've never reached much of a plateau where everything is 'in place.' \n\nEveryone who has a child is diving into a pool of uncertainty from which a parent is occasionally able to surface and get a breath. I hope you two can come to an active agreement how to handle this huge life decision.", "INFO: how long will it take you to become financially ready? \n\nYou have to take into account her age (the increased risk, decreased chance of conceiving). Would you rather run the risk of not being able to conceive together at all, vs. conceiving now and not having all debts paid off?", "35 F is a key age\u2026basically, better start trying.", "Meh... You'll never feel truly ready financially or any other way. (Saying this from experience). When you have a baby you figure it out and do the best you can.\n\nGetting pregnant could take a month or years you just never know unfortunately.", "yea your wife is on the clock now, once you hit 35 its harder to get pregnant and every year after that it gets harder and harder. Notwithstanding the attendant increase in potential genetic issues in your child. If this was always your intent then you\u2019ve wasted 7.5 years of her prime years.", "You realize that even she got pregnant on the first try, the baby won\u2019t be here for nine months (hopefully). If you put off trying for another year, she will be 36 and the her chances will decrease. A woman\u2019s eggs do have an expiration date. There will always be an excuse to wait. If you don\u2019t want them be honest with your wife.", "Her biological clock is ticking loudly.  It may also take awhile to get pregnant.  Not everyone is lucky enough to get pregnant when they want.  I\u2019m going to say NAH.  You both have valid concerns.  Good luck reaching a compromise.", "NAH.  It seems like OP doesn\u2019t understand how serious the biological clock is at 35. If he led her on for 7 years that he wanted to \u201ceventually\u201d have kids, then he has wasted her fertile years- maybe without realizing. I am going to give him the benefit of the doubt and say that he is unaware how serious of an issue this is. I understand his concerns about financial stability and emotional preparedness but waiting longer will be even more expensive if they have to do IVF. Some of the responsibility is on her for not making it clear to him at the beginning that there is a timeline. No one owes their partner children but everyone owes their partner clear & frequent communication on important issues like this. It\u2019s not fair at all but it\u2019s the reality that many men are ignorant about women\u2019s bodies.", "There is a reason that 35+ is considered geriatric pregnancy and high risk.... if it's been disproven, as some are saying above, then why hasn't the medical field changed their perspective? \n\nYes, there are lots of things you and your wife can consider doing to have children later, such as freezing eggs for a surrogate, but it's perfectly normal and understandable, especially for a woman in her mid 30s, to be upset you are delaying having children longer then she would like. It is after all her body that is carrying the baby. If she wants more than 1 with a few years between then it's absolutely valid for her to want to start now. Even if you started trying today, it would be almost a whole year before the baby arrived. \n\nYou're not an asshole for not wanting a baby now, but you guys really should have chosen an age to have children sooner. This can be a deal breaker for a lot of people.", "NAH. But to be honest no one is ever fully prepared for kids. And after 35 pregnancy can become more complicated. If you don\u2019t want kids anymore you need to tell her that so she can figure out what she wants to do.", "Having kids over 35 is considered a geriatric pregnancy and can have a higher degree of risk for parents and children.  Men are fertile for most of their lives but women only have a set length of time and she is nearing the end of hers.\n\nNAH but you need to have that talk and decide once and for all before she has regrets that she never tried to have kids while she was able.  You may not be at that stage but she appears to be approaching it.", "Info: you said you are waiting until you are financially stable. Are you guys living paycheck to paycheck or do you have some savings? I understand her want to have a child because she is getting older to have them and she probably wants to enjoy motherhood at a relatively young age, but if you guys aren\u2019t really financially stable enough to provide the basic necessities for a kid, I understand your hesitation.", "Her biological clock is ticking. The older she is the more complications come with pregnancy. If she's already 35 she's already considered a geriatric pregnancy.", "You realize the age factor hits your wife harder when it comes to kids. All you do is supply some DNA but her whole body gets wrecked in pregnancy? So maybe take that into consideration when you are setting your timeline.", "NAH. I have a friend who is in a reversed situation - he\u2019s now 40 and his wife is 35. Been together 15yrs. He wanted kids 5yrs ago because he didn\u2019t want to be an old dad. She kicked the can down the road so long that now he would be an old dad (in his words) but she\u2019s starting to want kids. He no longer wants kids but doesn\u2019t know how to tell her. \n\nIt\u2019s ok not to want kids. But this is a conversation you should\u2019ve had and agreed on an age to start trying long ago. Both are AH based on lack of communication.", "ESH.\n\nYou've been together for 7,5 years and you never had a talk about the specifics. Her pregnancy is now considered geriatric, and she's suddenly feeling the impending sense of time running out.\n\nThere is no perfect time to have a child. And there's no guarantee for fertility either.\n\nThe only guarantee you have is that its only going to get harder with time. And for her, there's a hard deadline coming in the next 10-15 years.", "NAH. She knows that biology is not on her side and there is more chance that getting pregnant can be hard + this one additional year increases risk of several diseases of your future children considerably. \nBut also, you have the right to not want children right now.", "I understand the financial situation and concerns, but there is no \"right\" time to have kids. Also you are not taking into account the time it may take you both to conceive.\n\nWe are also married five years and in a relationship 6 years before that. My age factor was a huge deciding factor in when we started trying. We started when I was 35 (him 42). It took us about 1 year and 2 early miscarriages.", "NAH. You don\u2019t feel financially ready, but keep in mind your wife is running out of time to have biological kids. It\u2019s still possible, but chances of bad outcomes will raise the older she is, especially past 35. Not to mention it may take awhile to conceive, assuming it\u2019s possible for you guys and there is no unknown fertility issues.", "NAH- you have a different definition of \"not immediately\". You've been together 7.5 years. That's \"not immediately\" for most people. Yet you, at 30 and male, have the option of waiting a few more years with reasonable hope of a good outcome.  She, female and 35, does not.\n\n To use an analogy, it's like you're sitting in train station waiting for your train to  arrive in an hour or two, reading magazines and eating popcorn,  while she's running down the platform trying to catch one that's already leaving the station.\n\n It might already be too late for her. Your hesitation might cost her the chance to ever be a parent.\n\n Can you live with that? Can she? If not, you both have some really hard decisions to make, immediately. At her age, fertility declines a bit every month. (And your does too, as you get older, fyi, and your chance of having a kid with birth defects rises. You don't get off scot-free, it's just not as drastic and immediate an effect for you.)\n\n This is  a tough decision, and not one you can keep kicking down the curb. Good luck to you both.", "YTA.  You told her you wanted kids but not immediately.  This is almost 8 years later.  I think it\u2019s safe to say you mislead her.  You aren\u2019t considering her window to have children is closing quickly if it hasn\u2019t already.  I have friends your wife\u2019s age that have tried both naturally and  via IVF without success.\n\nThat said, I am sympathetic.  It\u2019s good to try to be prepared as possible for kids to ensure you can given them a good life.  But a lot of people end up missing their window to do so by waiting for financial security.\n\nI suggest you take some time to sit with this and really decide how important having children is for your life.  I think most people that have kids aren\u2019t truly \u2018ready\u2019 but successful parents figure it out as they go.  That\u2019s life.  But most importantly, consider what your indecision could mean for your marriage.  If you two aren\u2019t on the same page, your wife may decide she needs to leave to find someone that will fulfill her needs.  And if she doesn\u2019t, and she misses her opportunity to be a mother, she will likely resent you for that.  Either outcome, I can\u2019t really fault her for.", "INFO: are you ever going to feel ready to try for a baby?", "35 is considered a geriatric pregnancy. Did you know that? Each  month YOU wait, increases the chance of her NOT getting pregnant...Or having complications with the birth, or her own health.\n\nEdit: I forget to mention that you are a supreme AH, for stringing your wife along for 7 years, under the guide of wanting kids. \n\nYou are 30.

You wanted to wait a bit, but you've been together 7 YEARS already.  \n3. She's 35 years old. If you're going to have kids, you probably want to start soon. \n4.

How much more time do you need?", "You two agreed you wanted kids but not immediately.  That was five years ago!  If your wife is 35 you're running our of time to be able to have children together.

And if you want kids WITH HER, you have to be ready for that. \n35 isn\u2019t too old for children, but y\u2019all are getting there. If you both want kids, the planning should start now.", "INFO: Has this conversation come up before? How many times? What did you say the other times?", "Have you researched a women's risks after 36 - it's the worst terminology, but it becomes am \"advanced maternal age\", so naturally she has to think about babies. 7.5 years is enough of a timeline for her to bring it up when you said you wanted to later. I think maybe ESH and you all should have had a real timeline discussion.", "If you are changing your mind about having kids, tell her that.  At least you are being honest with her, so you are NTA of course.  Neither is she.  At 35 it\u2019s tougher on a woman.  Her window is closing.  But if you don\u2019t want children, speak up and say so.  Then, let her do whatever she thinks is best (she might leave).", "NAH. While your concerns are reasonable and rational, hers are too. She has reached the age where risks of infertility and risks to her health start increasing significantly. 35 and older is considered a geriatric pregnancy, and higher risk. Sounds like you both could work on communication, as you both sort through legitimate emotions and rational concerns on both sides.", "NAH, but to be fair, I don\u2019t think anyone is ever really ready to have a kid. \n\nYou want to be a little more financially secure/debt free. Your wife is probably hearing the ticking of her biological clock", "ESH\n\nY\u2019all should have had a more specific conversation of the kids timeline when you got married.\n\nYour wife is 35 and wants children. She\u2019s at an age where she is probably starting to feel stress about the ability to get pregnant, potential issues, how old she wants to be at different stages in her child\u2019s life, etc. this is different for women than it is for men, and you need to be sensitive to that.\n\nHer comment about men \u201cnever being ready\u201d is stupid and false.

Not for anyone. She is 35 and feels her fertility slipping away. Just because you start trying doesn\u2019t mean she will get pregnant, some people have fertility issues they don\u2019t know about. Then when she is actually pregnant it is basically another year before the kiddo is even here. She is ready, perhaps compromise and give her a firm date, meet her in the middle at 6 months. Double down on paying your debts off so you feel better. Don\u2019t splurge on anything and just pay off your debt. A compromise is fair and shows ur in this with her.", "Info: do you think having to do IVF whenever you decide you're ready will be cheaper or a better option than having a biological child now? I don't think there's an AH in this scenario, but at 35, she needs a decision yesterday. One in eight women struggle to conceive, and age is a big risk factor not only in fertility, but also in the health of the child. Chromosomal problems, miscarriages and birth defects become more common the older the woman is.\nYou will also most likely not become pregnant immediately. Depending on your wife's birth control, it can take months for her hormones to level out and go back to normal. Then, you have to get the timing right. And even if you do everything right, there's only a 30% chance any fertilised egg will stick.

You two  aren\u2019t on the same page, and that\u2019s OK. But a few thoughts. First, I can almost guarantee that you\u2019re never ever going to feel like you are secure enough to be ready to provide for children. Too, unfortunately at 35 years old your wife is considered advanced maternal age. The likelihood of genetic birth defects begins to increase pretty significantly. Time is not on your side. I am sure that weighs heavily on her mind. Particularly if you are considering having more than one child. \n\nHonestly, I am wondering if you truly want children or if you were just open to the idea because you knew she wants them. You should not have children if you don\u2019t want them, but you also need to be prepared to live with the consequences of your decision.  This will negatively affect your relationship with your wife.", "NTA but 6 months is a good amount of time to reflect on such a big decision, so you also shouldn\u2019t be mad at your wife. \n\nAnother issue is, she\u2019s 35? Her biological clock is literally ticking, you should do a little research on getting pregnant 35+ just to be certain you understand the potential issues you and your wife may face trying to get pregnant when she is 36-37 years old. Many women get pregnant at these ages, but egg quality and other factors can make it more difficult, so it\u2019s good to be realistic about both your stresses (finances) and complications that you could face by waiting due to your wife\u2019s age.", "NTA however, you have to realise that her fertility window is starting to close. Its getting to the stage where a decision has to be made as if she is on birth control that takes maybe a year to fully come out of her system so it's getting nearer to 36 before she could fall, then you don't know if there are issues and you have to be trying for a year before treatment is considered which takes her to 37. Each year that passes,her chance of naturally falling pregnant lessens. If you don't want kids and she does, it may be fairer to let her go so she can consider things like a sperm donor if necessary.", "She doesn\u2019t have the luxury of waiting another year. Evry year you wait after 35 is a higher risk for mom and baby.", "ESH/bit of YTA\n\n6 months ago, was she already 35? I'm pregnant right now and we started trying when I was 29. Maybe your wife will be one of those lucky ones who easily gets pregnant like my aunt who had second wave of kids with 2nd husband in her late 30s/early 40s, but she might not. We started IVF when I was 33. I'm finally pregnant now at 34. My best friend is 36 and also had to do IVF to get pregnant. \n\nYou mention your financial situation, are you in debt or just don't have much saved? Are you two shared accounts or separate? If you wait another few years, you might have a higher chance of needing fertility treatments because of your wife's age. Not sure where you are located, but if you're in the USA, are you willing to spend a minimum of $20k+? I know in other countries, it can be as low as $5k USD. \n\nYou and your wife definitely need to discuss this in detail, perhaps do a few consultation with a fertility specialist. If anything, it may be with it to freeze your wife's ages. At this point, she's already considered geriatric for pregnancy. \n\nWill you stay with your wife if you can NEVER have bio kids with her? Like you wait and her egg supply diminishes more and fertility treatments don't work. I've seen some women try for 7+ cycles. How much are you willing to spend in the long run?

You say she didn\u2019t want them 6 months ago and many commenters are saying \u2018but when she wasn\u2019t ready it was fine\u2019 but the truth is as much as crave equality, having a baby is one of the few times we just never can be. Not only do women have to be mentally and financially ready like men do but they also have to be physically, deal with pregnancy, deal with how their careers are ultimately effected and in a lot of cases how much of the \u2018mental load\u2019 they can deal with. I imagine turning 35 was a wake up call. You are officially a \u2018geriatric pregnancy\u2019 (in the uk anyway) usually required to have extra tests, live with society telling you your biological clock is ticking (which is a horrible phrase but also true), more high risk and ultimately will probably have a longer recovery than someone in their 20s.\n\nWill a year make a massive difference, probably not. Will it for sure only be a year? That is the million dollar question. Whilst you have the fear it will happen to quickly, she is probably having the fear what if it doesn\u2019t? Fertility treatment can take years. She is telling you she wants kids sooner rather than later. If you are truly trailing your feet due to not being ready financially that is fair, but if she is just going to hear more excuses in a year then she is right and you need to decide if you actually want kids sooner rather than later", "There is no perfect time.

Our bodies slowly fall apart until we die. \n\nHealth is a better indicator than age for how difficult a pregnancy will be. But age IS a factor in fertility. Do you think menopause is a myth too?
