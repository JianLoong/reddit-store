She would stay in her room to study and at some point husband would knock saying \"Hey, I just had lunch, could you please clean up the table? I'm starting a meeting.\" Or \"I spilled some water, mind wiping it, I gotta focus on work!\" She told me she feels like he doesn't care about her learning time and he doesn't acknowledge she is also working. She told me she wouldn't have minded if it was a one-time occurrence, but it has became a habit of his.\n\nTo make sure of it, I asked daughter to not clean up next time he asks. I caught him red handed this time.

My husband sighed and said he thought it's not a big deal for my daughter to spare a couple minutes to quickly put the dishes in the dishwasher or something like that. Daughter said that if he thinks it could be done so quickly, why didn't he do it?\n\nI had to break the argument and determine that everyone cleans up after themselves.

Why should your daughter clean up HIS mess. That's crazy!!", "NTA  - your husband is an adult and can do these things himself. I assume your daughter does them for herself? \n\nWhen your daughter isn't home, what does he do? Bet he cleans up after himself then, right? \n\n  \nMy read on this is a combination of \"she's younger than me and she's female so she has to do these things because I asked\" - though I could be wrong on that.", "NTA. You are what I call a good parent. He is fully capable of cleaning up his own messes. If he doesn't want to, then he can just not make messes. Your daughter isn't his personal maid. She has responsibilities of her own and shouldn't have to set her study time aside to clean up after the poor helpless man.", "NTA. And you need to ask why he thinks it's okay to treat your daughter as his servant.", "NTA. Don\u2019t even think of the \u201cinterrupting her while she studies\u201d.

Absolutely NTA.", "So NTA. Thank you for standing up for your daughter. He's a grown man, and I question your statement that there's respect there. He obviously doesn't respect her or her priorities.

He's a grown ass man that can clean up after himself.\n\nNTA.", "NTA times a million. Why? Because your husband doesn't respect your daughter. He's trying to treat her like a live in maid.

But even if he has a \u201clogic\u201d based reason for it - he can just clean it up after he\u2019s done work.

He is very subtly pick, pick, picking away at her to make it uncomfortable for her to be there. He's establishing that his responsibilities are beneath him and it's up to those beneath him to handle them. He's exploiting those around him so he can focus on things he deems worthy. He is intentionally dominating her time and effort to interfere with her studies because he resents them and sees them as a threat. He is very likely trying to ensure that daughter is alienated from mother, so mother has no one to talk to and no way out. He wants daughter to suffer in her studies to hinder her ability to both surpass him in status and help mom escape him. Similar to the abusive tactic of interrupting sleep, it reduces performance and keeps the victim frustrated and confused, which makes for easier control.\n\nThis is deliberate, and should not be excused. People like this do not get better because this behavior serves them. The problem is, if he loses control or fears that he will, very bad things will happen. So far, tactics that he can hand wave and DARVO his way out of have worked. Once they don't, he has no reason to hide behind plausible deniability anymore. It's easy to brush this under the rug, but abuse is *way* more common than it seems. And it is tolerated because people don't understand what it looks like until they're trapped.

He seems to time it when OP isn't home, and daughter gets it done before OP gets home, so there's this whole dynamic happening behind OP's back.\n\nI'm not sure if he's throwing this same mentality at OP, or if he tried it and it didn't go anywhere, but it definitely sounds like he doesn't act this way towards OP.
