She would stay in her room to study and at some point husband would knock saying \"Hey, I just had lunch, could you please clean up the table? I'm starting a meeting.\" Or \"I spilled some water, mind wiping it, I gotta focus on work!\" She told me she feels like he doesn't care about her learning time and he doesn't acknowledge she is also working. She told me she wouldn't have minded if it was a one-time occurrence, but it has became a habit of his.\n\nTo make sure of it, I asked daughter to not clean up next time he asks. I caught him red handed this time.

My husband sighed and said he thought it's not a big deal for my daughter to spare a couple minutes to quickly put the dishes in the dishwasher or something like that. Daughter said that if he thinks it could be done so quickly, why didn't he do it?\n\nI had to break the argument and determine that everyone cleans up after themselves.

Why should your daughter clean up HIS mess. That's crazy!!", "NTA  - your husband is an adult and can do these things himself. I assume your daughter does them for herself? \n\nWhen your daughter isn't home, what does he do? Bet he cleans up after himself then, right? \n\n  \nMy read on this is a combination of \"she's younger than me and she's female so she has to do these things because I asked\" - though I could be wrong on that.", "NTA. You are what I call a good parent. He is fully capable of cleaning up his own messes. If he doesn't want to, then he can just not make messes. Your daughter isn't his personal maid. She has responsibilities of her own and shouldn't have to set her study time aside to clean up after the poor helpless man.", "NTA. And you need to ask why he thinks it's okay to treat your daughter as his servant.", "NTA. Don\u2019t even think of the \u201cinterrupting her while she studies\u201d.

Absolutely NTA.", "So NTA. Thank you for standing up for your daughter. He's a grown man, and I question your statement that there's respect there. He obviously doesn't respect her or her priorities.

He's a grown ass man that can clean up after himself.\n\nNTA.", "NTA times a million. Why? Because your husband doesn't respect your daughter. He's trying to treat her like a live in maid.

But even if he has a \u201clogic\u201d based reason for it - he can just clean it up after he\u2019s done work.

Definitely calling bullshit. Good for OP for calling out this one behavior this one time, but people don't just bust out this degree of shitty behavior out of the blue, and OP, if you want a decent relationship with your daughter, go talk to her and take an honest inventory of how your husband's misogyny has affected her.", "The studying doesn\u2019t even matter.
