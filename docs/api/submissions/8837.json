My husband (not her bio dad) has changed jobs and works full time from home now. I go to work from the office everyday so they're in the house by themselves.\n\nThey've always gotten along fairly good. There's respect, understanding and trust from each other's part. I don't know if there's love, but I can't push it. Husband met daughter too late to represent a father figure for her and she never seeked him like that, so he didn't push it.\n\nLately, my daughter complained that husband would put her to work, in disregard of the fact that she's learning. She would stay in her room to study and at some point husband would knock saying \"Hey, I just had lunch, could you please clean up the table? I'm starting a meeting.\" Or \"I spilled some water, mind wiping it, I gotta focus on work!\" She told me she feels like he doesn't care about her learning time and he doesn't acknowledge she is also working. She told me she wouldn't have minded if it was a one-time occurrence, but it has became a habit of his.\n\nTo make sure of it, I asked daughter to not clean up next time he asks. I caught him red handed this time. When I came home to the dirty table, I asked husband about it and he said \"Well \\[Daughter\\] should've cleaned it up!\" Daughter said she didn't even had lunch today (they don't always eat together, sometimes one is hungry and one is not) and she didn't have time to clean up the table. I jumped at my husband, telling him daughter has exams and came here to learn, not to clean up after him. He tried to defend himself saying he had an urgent meeting. I told him he could've came to clean up afterwards and mentioned I know it's not the first time it's happening. My husband sighed and said he thought it's not a big deal for my daughter to spare a couple minutes to quickly put the dishes in the dishwasher or something like that. Daughter said that if he thinks it could be done so quickly, why didn't he do it?\n\nI had to break the argument and determine that everyone cleans up after themselves. Later, my husband told me in private that he felt like I humiliated him in front of my daughter. I told him to grow up and stop acting like daughter will pick up after his mess. He got upset.

Why should your daughter clean up HIS mess. That's crazy!!", "NTA  - your husband is an adult and can do these things himself. I assume your daughter does them for herself? \n\nWhen your daughter isn't home, what does he do? Bet he cleans up after himself then, right? \n\n  \nMy read on this is a combination of \"she's younger than me and she's female so she has to do these things because I asked\" - though I could be wrong on that.", "NTA. You are what I call a good parent. He is fully capable of cleaning up his own messes. If he doesn't want to, then he can just not make messes. Your daughter isn't his personal maid. She has responsibilities of her own and shouldn't have to set her study time aside to clean up after the poor helpless man.", "NTA. And you need to ask why he thinks it's okay to treat your daughter as his servant.", "NTA. Don\u2019t even think of the \u201cinterrupting her while she studies\u201d. Just the audacity of your husband making a mess when HE has lunch or anything an then he can\u2019t be bothered to clean it up and demands she does it. What does he do when she\u2019s not there? Absolutely NTA.", "So NTA. Thank you for standing up for your daughter. He's a grown man, and I question your statement that there's respect there. He obviously doesn't respect her or her priorities. He's trying to take advantage of free labor.", "Op, you need to have a chat with your husband and ask him what he would have done if daughter wasn't there if he had dirtied some dishes or spilled water on the counter. Would he have waited for you to come home, or would he have done the responsible thing and did the job?\n\nShe is not a maid or a housekeeper. He's a grown ass man that can clean up after himself.\n\nNTA.", "NTA times a million. Why? Because your husband doesn't respect your daughter. He's trying to treat her like a live in maid. Cleaning up after his lunch? He spilled water and she needs to clean it up? Oh hell no. If this continues your daughter will opt out of coming to your home because she will feel unsafe and uncomfortable. Your husband is the biggest AH of today.", "NTA. His behavior is gross and misogynistic and he needs to get his head right because its a weird, domineering, controlling flex to dictate that she stop what she is doing to clean up after him, a grown, able bodied adult because he deems his time and priorities more important? Don't let this slide. He should be humiliated that he did such a weird, unnecessary thing.", "NTA\n\nHusband probably isn't too far off from pushing daughter into just not coming home anymore.  Why would she if she's just going to be expected to turn into Cinderella every time?", "NTA he was pulling a power play and he says you embarrassed him? No he embarrassed himself. Watch out for subtle microaggressions from him to your daughter. He's not happy she comes to your home.", "NTA\n\nSounds like your husband thinks that your daughter should clean up after him for some reason. Sexism maybe? I don't want to assume...\n\nEither way you need a set of house rules that say that everyone cleans up after themselves. If you are too busy to put your used dishes in the dishwasher then you are too busy to use dishes in the first place. \n\nWell done you on confirming the facts before you confronted your husband and on defending your daughter once you had the facts straight.", "nta\n\ngreat you stood up for your daughter. nothing more to say about it really.", "NTA!!! \n\nWhy can\u2019t HE \u201cspare a few minutes\u201d to clean up his own mess before HIS meeting? Why your daughter is home is completely irrelevant, he needs to learn to clean up after himself, he\u2019s an adult!", "NTA. He can accommodate his own needs. It makes no sense to me that your husband is asking your daughter to clean up after his messes.", "NTA.\n\nNor, is your daughter. Your husband, on the other hand, is being a huge AH.\n\nIt's not a big deal for someone else to clean up, but, for him to do it? OMG! He's busy!!!\n\nGood on you for putting your foot down and sticking up for your daughter.", "NTA. You make the mess, you clean it.", "Definitely not the AH. That\u2019s extremely weird and misogynistic. \n\nThat\u2019s good that they are comfortable enough around each other but the fact that she\u2019s technically a guests in the house negates her from doing anything besides cleaning up after herself. \n\nObviously if she wanted to do more that is up to her but it\u2019s completely inappropriate if your husband to ask her to clean up after him. If they were eating together and he asked her to grab his dishes also that\u2019s one thing but hey I spilled water and need you to clean it up? That is not ok.", "NTA but tire husbsnd is a sexist pig", "NTA at all. Good for you for sticking up for your daughter, and good for your daughter for pointing out her stepfather\u2019s misogynistic behavior. How in the world did you humiliate your husband? He should have been embarrassed of his actions all on his own.", "NTA. He does indeed need to grow up and stop acting entitled / misogynist (or whatever the precise flavour happens to be).", "NTA.  i can\u2019t tell if he misogynistic or just a lazy slob\u2026 probably both.   does he do this to you also when you\u2019re at home?  If it\u2019s pointed ONLY at your daughter as slave, there\u2019s a larger problem here.\n\nHe doubled down coming to you after the fact about humiliating him.  You of course did no such thing, and he ALSO knows that.", "NTA obviously your husband doesn\u2019t respect your daughter that much is clear. But the thing i just can\u2019t get over if he\u2019s so pressed for time how does he have time to go to your daughters room and have a conversation about cleaning up his lunch. I don\u2019t care how small your house, he\u2019s using his time to direct someone else to clean up after him instead of just using that time to do it himself. But even if he has a \u201clogic\u201d based reason for it - he can just clean it up after he\u2019s done work. He is bending over backwards to turn your daughter into his maid. \n\nAlso, how much of a mess is he making with lunch?!? Is he cooking full meals or does he just need to clear dishes and wipe the crumbs off a table. And If he\u2019s so pressed for time how does he have time to cook and why can\u2019t he just eat at the counter\u2026", "Is your husband power tripping or something? I'm petty, if he did it to me I will make sure the next time he has a meeting he will experience hell. NTA.", "NTA\nIf he wouldn\u2019t do that behavior at the office or if the daughter wasn\u2019t home he\u2019s acting out. Trust me when I say this he\u2019s way to old to be throwing a silent tantrum.", "NTA.  I would *never* stand up for a misogynist, partner or not.  In fact, I\u2019d expect my partner to be better.", "NTA. Your daughter is not your husband\u2019s maid and I don\u2019t know where he gets off treating her that way. That\u2019s some misogynistic BS right there. He embarrassed himself by asking your daughter to coddle him and clean up after him.", "NTA - Except the daughter. \n\nHusband is a big AH and sound a little misogynisty!\n\nHe need to be a big boy and learn to plan his day accordingly and clean up after himself.", "NTA! What on earth is he thinking?! She's not his slave and does not have a \"spare couple of minutes\" to clear up a mess he, a fully grown adult, made and could clear himself. You are 100% in the right and he needed to be called out.", "NTA\n\nThis is some bullshit.\n\nYour husband's apparent lack of time management is not your daughter's responsibility. If he has an urgent meeting, then he should plan his time better and be more mindful of the mess he's making so that there is less to clean. However:\n\n>Daughter said that if he thinks it could be done so quickly, why didn't he do it?\n\nClearly you daughter has your husband's number. I personally strongly suspect this has everything to do with what he thinks she *should* be doing for him as opposed to genuinely having no time to clean up after himself. His attitude absolutely reeks of sexism and you were right to tell him to grow up.\n\nJust out of interest, how did he react to the plan of your daughter coming home to study for finals?", "NTA and your daughter is fine.\n\nYou husband is a huge full-of-himself misogynistic AH.\n\nWhen I say \"accommodate his needs\" I though she was being loud while he took work calls or something, which would be on her and you. This is so far the other way it's ridiculous.\n\nIs your husband this much of a control-freak baby with you too?", "INFO: how did everything magically get cleaned up before your daughter was there? Did he call you at work to come home because he made a mess, or was he a big boy who could look after himself?", "NTA, good that you caught him and good for you for standing up for your daughter.\nWhen I was younger i was in college and working part time but still at home if I hadnt cleaned up dishes that weren't mine they would be put in my bedroom.", "NTA, daughters are not slaves.  He is perfectly capable of cleaning up his own messes.", "NTA, he can clean up after himself", "NTA. You had to make ot sink in to him, she us not a maid. \n\n>\"Hey, I just had lunch, could you please clean up the table? I'm starting a meeting.\" Or \"I spilled some water, mind wiping it, I gotta focus on work!\"\n\nClearly, he is a ass.", "NTA. Wtf! She is not his maid and he can clean up after himself.

WTF.\nWell done for taking your daughter's side, NTA!", "NTA. Your daughter is not his maid, he can clean up after himself. But you should talk to your husband because he really gives of sexist vibes when he just assumes your daughter will clean up his mess, most likely because she is a woman. For your own sake you should ask him why he feels that it is your daughters responsibility to keep his living space clean. Does he expect you do to all these things when your daughter isn't there?

NTA", "NTA", "NTA. your husband is. As if he\u2019d go to her room to get her to put something in the dishwasher, it would take him longer to do that than clean up his own mess.

There was no way in hell I was allow my daughter to clean up after a grown man (with some whole other business going on, at that) like a housemaid. I could see if she was a contributing part of the household that was expected to do chores and clean dishes and stuff. But it sounds like she's just there to work on school and to have an area to focus.", "So a grown man spills his drink and instead of grabbing the nearest towel to wipe it up he seriously and in all honesty thinks the right course of action is to get up, go to the nearest woman in the house and tell her to clean up after him? WTF. NTA", "NTA. You are a fantastic parent to back up your daughter against your husband\u2019s unreasonable demands. She has her own demands on her time that are just as important as his meetings - she is not his maid. There is no reason for *her* to clean up *his* messes just because he doesn\u2019t want to.

He is not her responsibility and his mess is not her responsibility.", "NTA! \n\nThose minutes he took to \n\n1. Go to her room\n2. Knock on the door\n3. Tell her what need to be done\n4.

I'm a stepmother and my daughter just so happens to be at home with us this week. She's getting ready for uni exams. I would usually ask her for some minor things here and there inside the house to help (doing the dishes a couple of times a week, looking after his brother if I'm going out to buy groceries), but this week all bets are off. She needs to study and I won't interfere with that time of hers. \n\nIt's ridiculous that even after (I'm guessing) hours he just said \n\n>\"Well \\[Daughter\\] should've cleaned it up!\"\n\nNo, sir, you should have. You have two good hands and some minutes to spare. I'm a WFH mom and sometimes I don't have time to go the bathroom, but I still take the time to do whatever is needed at the end of my day. \n\nStay strong OP, and do not let him put t his under the rug. I mean, what if Daughter wasn't there? Does he usually wait until you come home for you to clean??", "NTA. He humiliated himself thinking she was his maid.", "Ok, here's how I see it.\n\n1. It's totally reasonable for husband and/or you to ask your adult daughter to do some chores, while she stays in your house rent free.\n\n2. Cleaning up water he spilled, cleaning up his lunch mess.... Those are the kinds of chores husband should be doing himself. Personal mess he made himself.\n\n3.
