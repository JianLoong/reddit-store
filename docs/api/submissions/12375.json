We had talked about doing that before we asked our respective parent to do it. Both agreed and were touched.

He's been married to my mom since I was 4 and he has always wanted to be more to me than just my stepdad I don't really like. But he has always felt a little too suffocating, a little too traditional (I know he tried to get my dad to leave me alone for him to raise with my mom so I could have a traditional family unit), and generally not someone I enjoy spending time with. He's been there as long as I can remember but I can't say that's a good thing for me. Even though I spent just as much time with my dad as I did with my mom, my stepdad has always believed himself to be my primary father figure, and that he and my mom were more important in my life and childhood than my dad.\n\nThis has never been true. My dad has always been there. He has never stepped out of my life or taken being my dad for granted. It always bothered me how my stepdad seemed to view my dad and that my mom let it happen.

The reason being they dislike me for how I treat their dad. In their eyes I should be closer to him and they have let me know that before.\n\nMy stepdad asked me the other day why he hadn't heard from me on his father of the bride duties and I told him it was because he had none. He started a lecture on the importance of the position and I said my dad was the father of the bride, so he was doing it. Stepdad said he expected to do it. I told him I wasn't comfortable doing it with him. He asked why not both and let people see the man who raised me doing it alongside the bio dad. I told him that wasn't happening and he (and my mom when she found out) told me I should be ashamed for taking him for granted and for putting blood before real family.

I am sure you will be having more conversations about this as the day approaches but you are NOT disrespecting them by having your dad do the duties.\n\nHowever, there could also be more to this as I expect. If your stepdad paid for your college he may be expecting that to be his claim. I would just explain that this is your day. That you are not disrespecting them but you know they are disrespecting you by trying to force their expectations into your day.

This is the most blatant narcissism I have seen in a while. \n\n> (I know he tried to get my dad to leave me alone for him to raise with my mom so I could have a traditional family unit)\n\nThis is proof to me that regardless that your dad was in your life by choice and that made your SD unhappy that he is involved because he would like to be the sole father figure regardless of the fact that it is better for you to have your real father in your life. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Even though I spent just as much time with my dad as I did with my mom, my stepdad has always believed himself to be my primary father figure, and that he and my mom were more important in my life and childhood than my dad.\n\nThis is saying the same thing as far as I'm concerned. He wants to be the primary father figure but to bad he isn't because that's the facts. It seems like your dad has intentionally been a huge part of your life. Because of this it is fair that you would feel more strongly towards your father than your SD. For example: \n\n>My dad has always been there. He has never stepped out of my life or taken being my dad for granted.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis part is especially hard for me to understand: \n\n>I don't have a relationship with my half siblings who are 19f, 18m and 16f. The reason being they dislike me for how I treat their dad. In their eyes I should be closer to him and they have let me know that before.\n\nThis is not feelings that have most likely been said to or in front of your siblings. Most of the time people especially kids (yes I realize most of them are not still children but this doesn't sound new) do not just come up with this. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n> He asked why not both and let people see the man who raised me doing it alongside the bio dad.\n\nThis shows me that he does not believe that your father played an important part in raising you. He is trying to make you feel bad about your father and that is completely toxic. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is probably the biggest problem I have with the entire conflict:\n\n>Mom said I was disrespecting them both because she chose him.\n\nShe answered why this is so terrible all by herself. SHE chose him, not you and I'm going to guess you didn't have a real say in the matter because you were 4.
