You didn't throw the painting out or anything, just moved it.", "NTA.  You moved back in.  It is your home.  You may not own it, but you live there.  You're not a paid servant.  And you can't reason with a 2 y.o.  Your SIL is an adult, she should learn to act like one for the time being.", "NTA..   It's hard to imagine why the SIL is having such issues when she was told it scared the 2year.   MIL has put it... temporarily in the bed room and it will go back up after you leave.   SIL is being TH...", "NTA. I find it important that you tried to explain it to your kid. If that still doesn't work, I completely agree that it should be someplace your kid isn't regularly seeing it. It's more important not to traumatize a kid than to stroke your SIL's ego.", "NTA it's MIL's house and if she's cool with it then it's fine.", "NTA if MIL knew because you asked first and it's her house, SIL can deal with it.", "NTA.  SIL's argument doesn't have any merit. You moved in as a service to help take care of MIL as she ages and MIL was fine taking the painting down.  It is now located in her own bedroom.  SIL needs to develop a thicker skin when it comes to critiques of her work, especially from the toddler crowd.", "At that age, I was terrified of my mom's paisley curtains that would move in the wind.  It's nothing personal.  She's a toddler, and her needs Trump your SIL feelings.", "Your MIL made the decision to have it moved into her room. Your SIL needs to chill tf out.

Your SIL is being oversensitive.\n\nUnfortunately, at age 2, you can't prevent your daughter from being overly sensitive. You are therefore relying on your SIL to be the more mature one here.\n\n\"Sorry, my 2 year old has developed an irrational fear of that painting, I don't know why,\" is quite sufficient explanation. You're living in the house, you do get some say in these things.", "NTA. SIL is acting like a two year old.

You get a reasonable say in what\u2019s on the walls.\n\nB) MIL (owner of the artwork and home) was fine with moving the picture.\n\nSounds like SIL has a long term relationship with MIL, and isn\u2019t dealing with this recent change very well. Maybe she feels guilty that she and her husband weren\u2019t the ones to move back into the family home? Maybe she feels like her place in the home is being taken away? It feels like some sort of unresolved fear or guilt driving an irrational response to something seemingly harmless.\n\nI think the two of you need to go grab lunch and talk things through.

If you didn\u2019t live in the house and a picture in your MIL\u2019s house was scaring your 2 year old then it is the right thing to remove it, or cover it when your 2 year old visits. The fact that you do live there means it has to be removed for your child\u2019s sake. \n\nShe\u2019s a 2 year old child, she will get over the fear of whatever it is but right now it\u2019s causing her distress. How horrible is your SIL not to just understand this.", "NTA. It\u2019s still up, just in a different part of the house. Being scared of a painting might seem irrational but to a child that is completely understandable. \n\nI hope she\u2019ll respond the same way if she ever has a frightened toddler.", "NTA - The 2 year old is going to be in the home more often than the SIL. If the painting scares the kid it makes sense for it to be moved. \n\nSIL is being unreasonable.", "NTA but now I want to know what the painting was of haha", "Nta...you live there it IS your home. She does not live there and had no right to rehang it or dictate where it goes. The painting also dies not belong to her. It was gifted so mom can hang it inbthe outhouse or burn it if she wants. Furthermore a frightened 2 year old who doesn't need to be traumatized cause Auntie is a selfish AH who thinks she can run a someone elses home. Remove it and put it away where Aunty cant findnit again. Or burn it lol I'm petty like that. Or you could try to smooth feathers and ask madame l'artiste to paint something child friendly that could be hung there.", "NTA you are living there now, she needs to accept that yes, actually it is your home", "NTA. Your daughter is 2 and SIL is being unreasonable.

You live there and it is your home. You have the right to be comfortable in your own home. Your husband's brother and his family should be thanking you for caring for his mother.", "NTA. Your SIL is over reacting and making something out of a nothing burger.", "NTA.  If it was that good a painting it would be hanging in an art gallery somewhere.", "What kind of person gets pissy that their art scared a 2 year old and therefore it was moved? Most people (who have a heart) would be understanding. \n\nOp. NTA.", "Nta", "NTA, if your MIL has no problem with it being in her room then I don\u2019t see the issue. SIL gave the gift to your MIL she doesn\u2019t get to dictate how/where it is used.", "NTA. I was feeling uneasy at my fathers place when I was younger because of a Dal\u00ed painting (printed copy) in his living room. I always wished it wasn't there but never said anything.\n\nI still don't like that picture and I am 43 now.", "Is this story about Gladys, Pheobes artwork?", "NTA you said you talked to MIL first. I\u2019d tell SIL if it bothers her so much, feel free to move in and take care of her mom herself.", "INFO Did you talk to MIL before you took it down? How long had it been down? What is it a painting of?", "NTA, but I have some sympathy for your sister in law. You guys moving in is a concrete sign her mother is getting older, which is scary enough by itself. Then there's feelings about you (daughter in law) being there to help her while she (sister in law) is not. And there's coming back to visit the family home and things are different. \n\nConsciously or not, your sister in law may have felt like you moving her painting down was symbolic of you moving her out of her role as daughter. Not saying she's right, but she may already be oversensitive about her role as daughter being taken over, and you moving her gift to her mother might have touched that nerve. \n\nThe hard part is I know what is is like to be a 2 year old who is terrified by something innocuous. I have a clear memory from that age of a scary brown monster, as big as me, menacing me on a picnic blanket. It was shapeless and scary and it wouldn't go away. Years and years later I was looking at old family photos and saw some taken at that picnic. The big brown scary monster was there - it was my mom's leather sack purse! I could see in the photo that it was about as big as I was, and there we both were on the picnic blanket. I'm sure no one could figure out what was making me cry, just as I couldn't understand why nobody would take the scary monster away. \n\nI don't know why I told that story. Maybe if your sister in law could talk with your two year old herself to explain she made the painting and why, it would help demystify it?", "NTA. You may not own the home, but it is your home nonetheless.", "Why wouldn't you talk to *your MIL* about it before you took it down? That strikes me as pretty inconsiderate. Might've avoided this entirely if you had tbh", "Info: Why didn\u2018t you talk to your MIL and SIL before taking action?", "Drama from a scared 2yo vs drama from an adult? I\u2019ll side with the scared toddler every time. What\u2019s the painting of that scares the toddler? You talked to MIL first, you\u2019ve moved in to help so it\u2019s your house too, and seriously. SIL needs to calm down. Maybe you should wish a child \u201cjust like her\u201d on her. NTA. Thank you for being willing to help take care of your MIL.", "[deleted]", "[deleted]", "ESH if you took it down and moved it without asking your MIL as it's her home.\n\nBut SIL is also being dramatic when its upsetting the 2 year old.", "YTA, I have my own child (3 years old) i can understand wanting to protect them. HOWEVER, that does not give you the right to touch things that do not belong to you, especially when you hadn't even talked to the actual owner of the house and painting first before removing it. Of course your Sil is upset about what you did, she probably put a lot of work and thought into that painting only for you to think you can just take it down without discussing it with mil. You are a guest in someone else's home, you don't get to just touch their things.", "ESH.\n\nYou recently moved and the painting was already there. If you moved it not asking your MIL before or announcing it to SIL, and your SIL just comes to the house and surprise, she sees the gift she made that was always there missing, I get why she would be mad at the moment. It\u2019s her artwork, not some paint she just bought and gifted. And the fact it\u2019s only been hanged again after she expressed anger might be interpreted as you not willingly putting it back anywhere, but just because you didn\u2019t have a choice now that she saw it was down.\n\nBut now that your MIL took the decision to keep it in her room and time has passed, she should calm down and realise it\u2019s no big deal. Your daughter is only 2, you have little chance to convince her that it\u2019s not alive when even a chair can be alive for a 2 year old. And the paint is now hanging somewhere else. Just remind her you didn\u2019t want to hurt her feelings and it\u2019s just a temporary adjustment for your baby and if she still doesn\u2019t calm down, leave her alone.
