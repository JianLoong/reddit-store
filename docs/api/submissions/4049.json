Then there's feelings about you (daughter in law) being there to help her while she (sister in law) is not. And there's coming back to visit the family home and things are different. \n\nConsciously or not, your sister in law may have felt like you moving her painting down was symbolic of you moving her out of her role as daughter. Not saying she's right, but she may already be oversensitive about her role as daughter being taken over, and you moving her gift to her mother might have touched that nerve. \n\nThe hard part is I know what is is like to be a 2 year old who is terrified by something innocuous. I have a clear memory from that age of a scary brown monster, as big as me, menacing me on a picnic blanket. It was shapeless and scary and it wouldn't go away. Years and years later I was looking at old family photos and saw some taken at that picnic. The big brown scary monster was there - it was my mom's leather sack purse! I could see in the photo that it was about as big as I was, and there we both were on the picnic blanket. I'm sure no one could figure out what was making me cry, just as I couldn't understand why nobody would take the scary monster away. \n\nI don't know why I told that story. Maybe if your sister in law could talk with your two year old herself to explain she made the painting and why, it would help demystify it?", "NTA. You may not own the home, but it is your home nonetheless.", "Why wouldn't you talk to *your MIL* about it before you took it down? That strikes me as pretty inconsiderate. Might've avoided this entirely if you had tbh", "Info: Why didn\u2018t you talk to your MIL and SIL before taking action?", "Drama from a scared 2yo vs drama from an adult? I\u2019ll side with the scared toddler every time. What\u2019s the painting of that scares the toddler? You talked to MIL first, you\u2019ve moved in to help so it\u2019s your house too, and seriously. SIL needs to calm down. Maybe you should wish a child \u201cjust like her\u201d on her. NTA.

HOWEVER, that does not give you the right to touch things that do not belong to you, especially when you hadn't even talked to the actual owner of the house and painting first before removing it. Of course your Sil is upset about what you did, she probably put a lot of work and thought into that painting only for you to think you can just take it down without discussing it with mil. You are a guest in someone else's home, you don't get to just touch their things.", "ESH.\n\nYou recently moved and the painting was already there. If you moved it not asking your MIL before or announcing it to SIL, and your SIL just comes to the house and surprise, she sees the gift she made that was always there missing, I get why she would be mad at the moment. It\u2019s her artwork, not some paint she just bought and gifted. And the fact it\u2019s only been hanged again after she expressed anger might be interpreted as you not willingly putting it back anywhere, but just because you didn\u2019t have a choice now that she saw it was down.\n\nBut now that your MIL took the decision to keep it in her room and time has passed, she should calm down and realise it\u2019s no big deal. Your daughter is only 2, you have little chance to convince her that it\u2019s not alive when even a chair can be alive for a 2 year old. And the paint is now hanging somewhere else. Just remind her you didn\u2019t want to hurt her feelings and it\u2019s just a temporary adjustment for your baby and if she still doesn\u2019t calm down, leave her alone.

My husband was glad I moved it, was not offended at all", "NTA. SIL being ridiculous. But, people get attached and emotional on consistency when they come home, it\u2019s a source of comfort well into adulthood - and I imagine mom not doing well is a big change for her mentally/emotionally - the idea of letting go and the change of aging and also not physically being there - and so she\u2019s overreacting to a painting being moved for 100% reasonable reasons. NTA at all, sounds like SIL is processing other stuff and projecting it to the painting.", "NTA. \n\nArt is meant to inspire emotions. \n\nUnfortunately this time it's terror for a 2 year old.", "I think this would have been the case if they had put it back up, but they didn't", "Omg yes agree if my niece was afraid of something I made etc I\u2019d laugh it off as kids being unpredictable \ud83d\ude05 take it with a grain of salt not be salty", "Poor SIL, she knows she\u2019s more unreasonable than a toddler and so she has people scare babies for her", "It's clear SIL does not have children.

It is your home too. Even if you simply disliked it, it would be your prerogative to move it (with MILs permission of course). \n\n2) You had aforementioned permission. No one else in the house thinks you are being overly protective or boundary stomping. \n\n3) Your daughter is two. Two year olds are easily scared by random things. It is more than likely that she\u2019ll grow out of her fear, and voila, the painting can go back on the wall. \n\n\nThis is not a you problem. This is a her problem.

No issues. Your SIL is making a mountain out of a molehill", "Not only that, but SIL's argument doesn't hold water anyway. They do live there, she's the one that doesn't.

Your SIL is showing less maturity than your two year old.", "When I was 7 years old, I used to sleep in my grandparents' bedroom and they had two pictures - one of themselves and one just of my grandma.

It's not her house either", "NTA.\n\nSo you moved to help the mother in law. If it is not your home, what are you, hired help? Are they paying you, then? They need a reality check.

We lived in the woods.", "I was afraid of the wallpaper in our house It was like embossed shells?

There were rats in there and I was afraid of falling in.)", "That's not true, though.", "She is 2. She is scared and it is totally normal to remove scary things for 2y old.

MIL said it was fine to remove it. If she want that so bad she can move back and help with MIL.", "NTA. It seems like this is a teething issue regarding your SIL needing to adjust your the fact that this is your home now and not just her mother's home. She won't like changes you make and it will grate on her when she can't treat it as she always did. It's very common when one child moves into the family home and I wouldn't acquiesce too much as the adjustment needs to be made and you'll just be delaying the inevitable.", "NTA in any sense. \n\nJust curious as to what the painting is though?", "NTA\n\nNow you've moved in, it is your home.  It is also your MIL's home.  SIL doesn't live there: it is not her home, so she doesn't get a say. You wanted to move the picture and MIL agreed. That should have been the end of it.  That SIL put the picture back is unbelievable, particularly when she knew it was scaring a two year old.  I think the next message to SIL should be along the lines of:\n\n*I live here - this is MIL's home and mine. You don't live here - it is not your home.*\n\n*Your picture that scares my child has been moved again. If you put it back it will be destroyed.*\n\nOne thing: I see that SIL is the wife of your husband's brother: your husband should be dealing with this, with his brother.", "NTA, good on you for supporting your child.

Your SIL is acting like a child. Your daughter is 2. If mom is ok with it, then I wouldn\u2019t worry. Don\u2019t feed into the drama, remain calm, rational and ignore SIL if you must.

It was a thoughtful gift and you moved it without telling her. I don\u2019t see why there is such a emergency that you had to do that without nicely letting her know.", "Act? Yeah nah, SIL needs to BE an adult.", "I think both OP and the SIL married into the family, the homeowner is an in-law to both of them.\n\nMakes this even weirder to me, SIL is throwing a tantrum over someone's else's mother's decor in a \"family home\" that she didn't grow up in because she married into that family, same as OP.", "Also she is not the owner of the painting. She conceded all rights to it when she gave it to her mother.", "The home owner accepted.

Is it possible BIL and SIL have been on the receiving end of complaints from  MIL for you moving in?", "You aren\u2019t freeloading. You moved into a family home to care for an aging relative.

Similar story here. Before I was old enough to be in school, my great grandma used to babysit me at her house. She had this set of bull horns hanging in her basement that I was absolutely TERRIFIED of. Wouldn't go down there alone, even with the lights on. I guess I thought some kind of monster was coming out of the wall, who knows, like you said, kids are weird.\n\n\nI outgrew that fear by the time I started school, and she left them to me when she died ~10yrs later. I still have them hanging on my wall.
