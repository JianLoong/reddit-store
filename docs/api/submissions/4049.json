What is it a painting of?", "NTA, but I have some sympathy for your sister in law. You guys moving in is a concrete sign her mother is getting older, which is scary enough by itself. Then there's feelings about you (daughter in law) being there to help her while she (sister in law) is not. And there's coming back to visit the family home and things are different. \n\nConsciously or not, your sister in law may have felt like you moving her painting down was symbolic of you moving her out of her role as daughter. Not saying she's right, but she may already be oversensitive about her role as daughter being taken over, and you moving her gift to her mother might have touched that nerve. \n\nThe hard part is I know what is is like to be a 2 year old who is terrified by something innocuous. I have a clear memory from that age of a scary brown monster, as big as me, menacing me on a picnic blanket. It was shapeless and scary and it wouldn't go away. Years and years later I was looking at old family photos and saw some taken at that picnic. The big brown scary monster was there - it was my mom's leather sack purse! I could see in the photo that it was about as big as I was, and there we both were on the picnic blanket. I'm sure no one could figure out what was making me cry, just as I couldn't understand why nobody would take the scary monster away. \n\nI don't know why I told that story. Maybe if your sister in law could talk with your two year old herself to explain she made the painting and why, it would help demystify it?", "NTA. You may not own the home, but it is your home nonetheless.", "Why wouldn't you talk to *your MIL* about it before you took it down? That strikes me as pretty inconsiderate. Might've avoided this entirely if you had tbh", "Info: Why didn\u2018t you talk to your MIL and SIL before taking action?", "Drama from a scared 2yo vs drama from an adult? I\u2019ll side with the scared toddler every time. What\u2019s the painting of that scares the toddler? You talked to MIL first, you\u2019ve moved in to help so it\u2019s your house too, and seriously. SIL needs to calm down. Maybe you should wish a child \u201cjust like her\u201d on her. NTA. Thank you for being willing to help take care of your MIL.", "[deleted]", "[deleted]", "ESH if you took it down and moved it without asking your MIL as it's her home.\n\nBut SIL is also being dramatic when its upsetting the 2 year old.", "YTA, I have my own child (3 years old) i can understand wanting to protect them. HOWEVER, that does not give you the right to touch things that do not belong to you, especially when you hadn't even talked to the actual owner of the house and painting first before removing it. Of course your Sil is upset about what you did, she probably put a lot of work and thought into that painting only for you to think you can just take it down without discussing it with mil. You are a guest in someone else's home, you don't get to just touch their things.", "ESH.\n\nYou recently moved and the painting was already there. If you moved it not asking your MIL before or announcing it to SIL, and your SIL just comes to the house and surprise, she sees the gift she made that was always there missing, I get why she would be mad at the moment. It\u2019s her artwork, not some paint she just bought and gifted. And the fact it\u2019s only been hanged again after she expressed anger might be interpreted as you not willingly putting it back anywhere, but just because you didn\u2019t have a choice now that she saw it was down.\n\nBut now that your MIL took the decision to keep it in her room and time has passed, she should calm down and realise it\u2019s no big deal. Your daughter is only 2, you have little chance to convince her that it\u2019s not alive when even a chair can be alive for a 2 year old. And the paint is now hanging somewhere else. Just remind her you didn\u2019t want to hurt her feelings and it\u2019s just a temporary adjustment for your baby and if she still doesn\u2019t calm down, leave her alone.

I can\u2019t believe how stupidly immature your SIL is for for dying on this hill.", "YTA.\n Not your house, not your choice.  Your kid will lose her fear with multiple exposures.  You should have asked permission from the home owner first, fully accepting the possibility of a \"no\" answer.", "If SIL wants the painting up where she wants it, she can move back in and take care of mom.", "I was terrified of an ornate cabinet in my aunt and uncle\u2019s house lol.", "Why? The person who house it actually is (MIL) was ok with it. Why should SIL have any say? And just saying the 2 year old needs to learn doesn\u2019t make the 2 year old just learn. They\u2019re two.", "The owner of the house agreed to move it before it was moved", "NTA. Your daughter is the priority\n\nI took down a crucifix my husband had in his workroom. It was painted with blood dripping and stuff. It scared our twin daughters when they were little so I removed it to a place they wouldn't see it. My husband was glad I moved it, was not offended at all", "NTA. SIL being ridiculous. But, people get attached and emotional on consistency when they come home, it\u2019s a source of comfort well into adulthood - and I imagine mom not doing well is a big change for her mentally/emotionally - the idea of letting go and the change of aging and also not physically being there - and so she\u2019s overreacting to a painting being moved for 100% reasonable reasons. NTA at all, sounds like SIL is processing other stuff and projecting it to the painting.", "NTA. \n\nArt is meant to inspire emotions. \n\nUnfortunately this time it's terror for a 2 year old.", "I think this would have been the case if they had put it back up, but they didn't", "Omg yes agree if my niece was afraid of something I made etc I\u2019d laugh it off as kids being unpredictable \ud83d\ude05 take it with a grain of salt not be salty", "Poor SIL, she knows she\u2019s more unreasonable than a toddler and so she has people scare babies for her", "It's clear SIL does not have children. And probably shouldn't. NTA.", "I was afraid of open umbrellas", " Gladys and Glynnis", "There was nothing silly that scared you as a kid? My aunt has a ram sculpture that terrified me as a child. Didn't help it was in a common area, and I'd run past it to get to the kitchen. At 38, the damn thing still makes me uneasy.\n\nThe painting was a gift to MIL. She was ok with it being moved. NTA", "You don't know that they 'can't be bothered' and that's why they're not the ones moving in. Maybe they have demanding or important jobs, or other things to consider.", "It is her home right now, but more to the point it's MIL's house and she okayed the move. It's neither SIL's house nor home so not sure why she gets to overrule the homeowner.", "That's fine. But they don't get to criticize how decorations are changed in a house that's not even theirs. The brother and SiL aren't there day to day for whatever reason. The OP is.", "Yeah, I don't disagree with that, I just think it's unfair to judge them for not moving in to care for her."]}
