I don\u2019t mind watching Ben at all because I love my brother, and he\u2019s a total sweetheart.\nI\u2019ve gotten into the habit of speaking to him and singing to him in spanish. He really likes it, and I didn\u2019t think he totally comprehended what I was saying but he\u2019s clearly paying attention to my words.\n\nThe other night at dinner, Ben asked for more juice, but he said it in spanish instead of english. Usually when he speaks english, his sentences are two words at the most, but this was like a full on sentence.\n\nWhen Ben was in bed later, Eliza asked me if I had been teaching him spanish. I said that I\u2019d been speaking to him in it, but I didn\u2019t know that he picked up enough to be able to speak it himself.\n\nShe got mad at me and told me that I shouldn\u2019t have taught her child anything without asking her permission first, and that she wanted me to stop speaking to him in any language other than english from now on. I brought it up to my dad later and he said that Eliza is his wife, so he supports her position, and that she\u2019s also Ben\u2019s mother so I should be consulting her when it comes to her child.\n\nI mentioned it to my mom and she said Eliza is being ridiculous.\n\nI feel kinda bad though.

You are 1/2 spanish, and if she expects you to give up that part of your heritage, then she is the real AH here, and a racist if you want to go that far.

I think the step mother is jealous seeing her baby bond with you better than her.

Your dad is supporting his wife when it comes to their son, and that's admirable. You're just bonding with your half-brother, which is sweet. And Eliza is probably concerned that she won't be able to understand her son if you teach him another language, which is understandable.

It's an incredibly valuable thing for him to know! Depending on where he grows up, it will increase his ability to interact with the world around him! It will also be good for future career prospects, and being multilingual has been shown to cognitively benefit kiddos. \n\nIt probably surprised Eliza to hear 'quiero mas jugo' or something similar instead of the English equivalent, and she might feel guilty also for leaving her son with you so much that he learned a whole ass new language.

I'm from the province of Friesland in the Netherlands, we used to be our own country and have our own language alongside Dutch (everyone also speaks Dutch) Friesian is also officially the second native language in the Netherlands, although some people here like to joke around about it being \"just a weird accent\" Usually Friesians are proud of their heritage and language, but there are also parents being very weird about their kid speaking or learning it, afraid their Dutch pronunciations might suffer or something like that. While that may be true for some kids, as said above, mostly people benefit in more than one way from being able to speak/know more than one language. I will never understand those parents being so against another language and even more so when it's their own native language (especially in the case of Friesian, since it is slowly dying out) But here we are... some Friesian born and raised parents making sure their kids will only speak Dutch. Which they will learn anyway since that's the main national language. I know the Friesian language really doesn't mean anything when you compare it to a language like English, but even so, bilingualism strengthens cognitive abilities.

You'll give him a HUGE leg up in life. I've been passed up for job opportunities because I don't speak Spanish. I've tried to learn so many times but it's hard as an adult to learn another language. Your step mother is being ridiculous and probably just doesn't want him insulting her back talking her in a language she doesn't know.", "NAH unless you push this. You weren't wrong to speak Spanish around him when you didn't think it was a big deal. However, now you know the mom doesn't want you to do that. So just drop it.\n\nIt would be weird if your nephew picked up Spanish better than English and then primarily communicated in a language his own mother didn't understand.

Nobody ever told you that you could not speak spanish while at your dads, so how are you supposed to have known that? Being exposed to multiple languages is good for kids. \nSo now you have to decide, do you A)speak only english as requested B) continue to do what you do, saying you forgot or C) go for a form of malicious compliance and not speak spanish to the baby but devote serious time to teaching yourself AND the baby German, or French, or Russian or Mandarin.", "NTA. Stop babysitting Ben, if she wants to be that controlling she can pay someone to watch him full time", "I'd be so tempted when Ben is older to gift him Spanish learning books (Amazon \u00a33.99 for 5-7yrs). I started in lockdown to occasionally buy then send my Sister's littles learning supplies which I have been told they really enjoy doing. Have now been inspired to look at sending language learning books.

No worries :)", "He is talking and singing to soothe a baby, if the parents don't want the baby taking on his traits then they should spend more time raising him", "Kids are gonna learn *A TON* outside of what their parents teach them, the sooner mom gets her head around that, the better. Why *wouldn't* you want your kid to learn as much as possible anyway?

The mother is so jealous at her baby bonding with someone else that she's trying to rob them of a beautiful gift and I think it's a shame.", "NTA. You didn\u2019t do anything wrong. I live in Canada and learned to speak French and Spanish along with English. I have neither Spanish or French ancestry. Being able to speak multiple languages is a wonderful gift. As an adult, it\u2019s been helpful in my work and is a great advantage when I travel. \n\nYour stepmom sounds like she has some prejudices and your dad is wrong to go along with this. He probably doesn\u2019t want to rock the boat or he may feel the same way as her. I\u2019m not sure of his motives.

You sound like an amazing person actually.", "So your own father doesn\u2019t even take your side?! His wife isn\u2019t the one with your brother most of the time, why is she requiring that you ask permission for that?", "NTA but some context from my experience\n\nThere is a school of thought that learning 2 languages leads to delayed speaking or causing language confusion, so maybe his mother is worried about that? I think it is losing credibility as time goes on.\n\nThis is my experience though- my wife only speaks to our son (3yo) in Spanish and I do English. He's a bit behind some of his peers in speaking (but not hugely and he's ahead of some others) but has understood everything in both languages for a long time. In the last 2 months has started speaking full sentences/conversations and it just started one day like flicking a switch. He can also switch between languages on a dime and knows exactly who to speak which language to. It's pretty amazing and having struggled to learn Spanish as an adult I think teaching a second language at such a young age is absolutely one of the biggest gifts.", "NTA. It may be that she doesn\u2019t want her son speaking a language she doesn\u2019t speak because she won\u2019t be able to understand him. I would feel a little left out if my kid started communicating in full sentences I couldn\u2019t understand. That being said, I\u2019d never stop him from learning beyond what I can teach him. A second language is an amazing gift. I\u2019ve seen a lot of racist accusations at Eliza and I was just trying to offer another perspective. \n\nAlso totally agree with others that you\u2019re doing a lot of heavy lifting in child care for them.

Taking a break may give you both time to think about the situation and decide how, or if, you want to go about babysitting in the future. If she still doesn't want her child learning Spanish then it would be illogical for a Spanish speaking person to sit for her. I'm not advocating NC or any sort of emotional confrontation. Simply 'grey rock' them with the facts, as you see them.

You sound like an awesome older sister. I would love for you to come babysit my kids and teach them Spanish!", "Some kids speech is delayed by years when multiple languages are spoken around them. Doctors say solution is to stop the second language. Boys aren\u2019t as communicative as girls, but all of this is dependent on child. I don\u2019t know if this is the case here.
