My baby brother Ben (2m) is from my dad\u2019s marriage to his wife Eliza (33f).\n\nMy mom\u2019s family is from Mexico, so while I don\u2019t read or write in spanish, I do speak it. I tend to sometimes forget a word in english and then replace it with its equivalent in spanish, or sometimes I\u2019ll switch languages because I\u2019m thinking in one but trying to speak the other.\nIt usually happens when I\u2019m not too focused, but no one has ever had an issue with it, and most people usually understand what I\u2019m getting at based on context.\n\nI babysit my little brother pretty often since my dad and Eliza work longer hours a few nights a week. I don\u2019t mind watching Ben at all because I love my brother, and he\u2019s a total sweetheart.\nI\u2019ve gotten into the habit of speaking to him and singing to him in spanish. He really likes it, and I didn\u2019t think he totally comprehended what I was saying but he\u2019s clearly paying attention to my words.\n\nThe other night at dinner, Ben asked for more juice, but he said it in spanish instead of english. Usually when he speaks english, his sentences are two words at the most, but this was like a full on sentence.\n\nWhen Ben was in bed later, Eliza asked me if I had been teaching him spanish. I said that I\u2019d been speaking to him in it, but I didn\u2019t know that he picked up enough to be able to speak it himself.\n\nShe got mad at me and told me that I shouldn\u2019t have taught her child anything without asking her permission first, and that she wanted me to stop speaking to him in any language other than english from now on. I brought it up to my dad later and he said that Eliza is his wife, so he supports her position, and that she\u2019s also Ben\u2019s mother so I should be consulting her when it comes to her child.\n\nI mentioned it to my mom and she said Eliza is being ridiculous.\n\nI feel kinda bad though.

You are 1/2 spanish, and if she expects you to give up that part of your heritage, then she is the real AH here, and a racist if you want to go that far.  I think that they can be prepared for you to no longer babysit your little brother if they do not want you speaking spanish around him.\n\nBeing bi-lingual is great. and if your brother can learn it at this age, that is even better for him.   \n IMO if they are not paying you for the babysitting, then they can stuff it., or find another babysitter that does not speak spanish.", "NTA \n\nShe\u2019s way too insecure as a mother. \n\nOr she\u2019s the right amount of insecure and is even more so TA", "You\u2019re not a hired and paid babysitter; you\u2019re his sister, so this is part of your relationship with him.

Being bilingual gives children a huge academic advantage as well as an advantage in life, since they can communicate with more of the world\u2019s population, and it makes it easier to learn future languages as well.\n\nDon\u2019t stop singing and speaking to him in Spanish, but see if your stepmother will look up some of the advantages and see what a wonderful thing you\u2019re doing for your brother!", "NTA and what if it has been another baby sitter they had employed. I think the step mother is jealous seeing her baby bond with you better than her. Spanish is a beautiful language and do make it clear to them that you will speak in whatever language you want to your baby brother and they cannot demand what language you speak.

But when I was 5 I had a Spanish lesson in school and 24 years later I can still remember everything I was taught).\n\nBeing multilingual is so useful in the real world and it could help him one day.

Your dad is supporting his wife when it comes to their son, and that's admirable. You're just bonding with your half-brother, which is sweet. And Eliza is probably concerned that she won't be able to understand her son if you teach him another language, which is understandable.

It's an incredibly valuable thing for him to know! Depending on where he grows up, it will increase his ability to interact with the world around him! It will also be good for future career prospects, and being multilingual has been shown to cognitively benefit kiddos. \n\nIt probably surprised Eliza to hear 'quiero mas jugo' or something similar instead of the English equivalent, and she might feel guilty also for leaving her son with you so much that he learned a whole ass new language.

I'm from the province of Friesland in the Netherlands, we used to be our own country and have our own language alongside Dutch (everyone also speaks Dutch) Friesian is also officially the second native language in the Netherlands, although some people here like to joke around about it being \"just a weird accent\" Usually Friesians are proud of their heritage and language, but there are also parents being very weird about their kid speaking or learning it, afraid their Dutch pronunciations might suffer or something like that. While that may be true for some kids, as said above, mostly people benefit in more than one way from being able to speak/know more than one language. I will never understand those parents being so against another language and even more so when it's their own native language (especially in the case of Friesian, since it is slowly dying out) But here we are... some Friesian born and raised parents making sure their kids will only speak Dutch. Which they will learn anyway since that's the main national language. I know the Friesian language really doesn't mean anything when you compare it to a language like English, but even so, bilingualism strengthens cognitive abilities.
