My baby brother Ben (2m) is from my dad\u2019s marriage to his wife Eliza (33f).\n\nMy mom\u2019s family is from Mexico, so while I don\u2019t read or write in spanish, I do speak it. I tend to sometimes forget a word in english and then replace it with its equivalent in spanish, or sometimes I\u2019ll switch languages because I\u2019m thinking in one but trying to speak the other.\nIt usually happens when I\u2019m not too focused, but no one has ever had an issue with it, and most people usually understand what I\u2019m getting at based on context.\n\nI babysit my little brother pretty often since my dad and Eliza work longer hours a few nights a week. I don\u2019t mind watching Ben at all because I love my brother, and he\u2019s a total sweetheart.\nI\u2019ve gotten into the habit of speaking to him and singing to him in spanish. He really likes it, and I didn\u2019t think he totally comprehended what I was saying but he\u2019s clearly paying attention to my words.\n\nThe other night at dinner, Ben asked for more juice, but he said it in spanish instead of english. Usually when he speaks english, his sentences are two words at the most, but this was like a full on sentence.\n\nWhen Ben was in bed later, Eliza asked me if I had been teaching him spanish. I said that I\u2019d been speaking to him in it, but I didn\u2019t know that he picked up enough to be able to speak it himself.\n\nShe got mad at me and told me that I shouldn\u2019t have taught her child anything without asking her permission first, and that she wanted me to stop speaking to him in any language other than english from now on. I brought it up to my dad later and he said that Eliza is his wife, so he supports her position, and that she\u2019s also Ben\u2019s mother so I should be consulting her when it comes to her child.\n\nI mentioned it to my mom and she said Eliza is being ridiculous.\n\nI feel kinda bad though. I wanna know if I overstepped or something.", "created_utc": 1682279974, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12wo28h/aita_for_teaching_my_brother_another_language/", "score": 87, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

At all. Sounds like you\u2019re doing a lot of childcare for them though.  If you\u2019re the only one who speaks Spanish around him and his actual parents speak English and he is saying more in Spanish than English, it\u2019s a really good sign that you do more parenting and speaking to him than his actual parents. \n\nYou didn\u2019t intend to raise him bilingual but they would be foolish to stop it from happening as having a second language is a huge gift. \n\nI feel certain that his parents are a bit embarrassed that it\u2019s become obvious how much time you spend alone with him compared to them", "Parents pay extra here to send their child to care places where they can learn a second/third/fourth language. Its a huge leg up in life. As a bilingual person myself I have 100% been chosen for jobs and charged higher rates because of my bilingualism.\n\nAmerica is so weird.", "NTA. Considering they offer language in school. It's a plus when he's older and job hunting.", "NTA. She is a foolish woman to begrudge her child a caring sibling as well as language tutor.", "NTA. You shouldn't need permission to teach/learn another language", "NTA\n\nAlso, linguistic researches show that kids who grow up multilingual have cognitive benefits and have advantages when it comes to understanding the system of your mothertongue and learning additional languages at school. Keep speaking Spanish to him. He'll thank you later.", "Info: do they pay you to babysit or are you doing it for free?", "NTA\n\nHaven't seen it mentioned so, your dad is a bit of an AH here. Totally skipped out on giving any real answer, and just said I take her side because she's my wife.", "Nta. Learning a diff language is an advantage. But perhaps you can have a conversation with Eliza.\n\nI suspect she is afraid her son learning a diff language (that she doesnt use) at his young age would influence his identity or strengthen some bonds that she wouldnt be a part of.", "info: do they have a history of racism?", "NTA\n\nYour step mom is being over the top. You can't teach anything to your brother? What are you, just someone who is supposed to sit there, leave him to it and make sure he doesn't hurt himself? If she wanted to ask you to teach him only English, which she has a right to, she could be kind about it.", "NTA:  Your step mom is TA.  You are 1/2 spanish, and if she expects you to give up that part of your heritage, then she is the real AH here, and a racist if you want to go that far.  I think that they can be prepared for you to no longer babysit your little brother if they do not want you speaking spanish around him.\n\nBeing bi-lingual is great. and if your brother can learn it at this age, that is even better for him.   \n IMO if they are not paying you for the babysitting, then they can stuff it., or find another babysitter that does not speak spanish.", "NTA \n\nShe\u2019s way too insecure as a mother. \n\nOr she\u2019s the right amount of insecure and is even more so TA", "You\u2019re not a hired and paid babysitter; you\u2019re his sister, so this is part of your relationship with him. I think you\u2019re not only NTA, but you\u2019re giving him a wonderful gift. Being bilingual gives children a huge academic advantage as well as an advantage in life, since they can communicate with more of the world\u2019s population, and it makes it easier to learn future languages as well.\n\nDon\u2019t stop singing and speaking to him in Spanish, but see if your stepmother will look up some of the advantages and see what a wonderful thing you\u2019re doing for your brother!", "NTA and what if it has been another baby sitter they had employed. I think the step mother is jealous seeing her baby bond with you better than her. Spanish is a beautiful language and do make it clear to them that you will speak in whatever language you want to your baby brother and they cannot demand what language you speak. El espa\u00f1ol es muy hermoso y es m\u00e1s relajante para los beb\u00e9s.", "NTA I am so beyond the stance if the wife says x I do x. I tell my wife if it's her or the kids I am saving the kids. Op your dad and that crazy women are the AH", "NTA - Older siblings teach their younger siblings things. That's just being a good big sister. Honestly, Eliza's reaction seems borderline racist. Not saying that is necessarily the case, but the big red flag has definitely been raised.", "NTA\n\nYou didn't do it intentionally and if anything, this is helping your brother in so many ways! \n\nNot only as you mentioned that he spoke in a full sentence as opposed to speaking 2 or so words in English but it's also so beneficial to teach children other languages while their young. \n\n(I went to a language secondary school where I had to learn French, hardly remember any of it. But when I was 5 I had a Spanish lesson in school and 24 years later I can still remember everything I was taught).\n\nBeing multilingual is so useful in the real world and it could help him one day. If someone began teaching my kids another language, I'd be buying them cookies personally.", "NTA. You are very nice to help out, but you are a son in this family, not free childcare. If they\u2019re going to treat you like you\u2019re the help instead of the loving brother you are, you should stop babysitting immediately. If she\u2019s going to pull the \u201cbecause I\u2019m the mom\u201d card then let her be a mom and figure it out herself.", "NTA. I got (and keep getting) a lot of criticism from people for not teaching my kids my birth language. Here someone is willing to teach a kid a pretty useful second language. They should be extatic", "NTA. You don't have to ask anyone's permission to speak to your brother in the language you want, aside from the fact that learning Spanish will benefit him in the future.", "NTA and your dad\u2019s wife is an idiot. The younger you are, the easier it is to learn another language, which is a marketable job skill when you\u2019re older!", "NTA, not remotely. That\u2019s just HER reaction and it\u2019s ludicrous. Maybe she\u2019s jealous because she\u2019d like to learn too?!  I would!\n\nI mean seriously...almost anyone else would be like, \u201cWow, that\u2019s amazing!\u201d ...not some version of \u201chow dare you\u201d? Like on WHAT planet does her reaction make sense. So cool of you to do that.\n\nSo when\u2019s our first lesson?  \n\nCheers, awesome big brother.", "NTA What a wonderful gift to your brother to give him a second language so young! Speak english when sm is around and continue spanish when shes not. He'll figure out how to separate them. If you get caught, do an OMG I didn't realize and am so sorry routine.", "NTA.\n\nWhy do you think you need permission to teach your brother a new language?", "NAH - Blended families are so difficult, and it can be even more difficult when parents were basically kids themselves at first. Your dad is supporting his wife when it comes to their son, and that's admirable. You're just bonding with your half-brother, which is sweet. And Eliza is probably concerned that she won't be able to understand her son if you teach him another language, which is understandable. (Your mom needs to see herself out of this particular discussion, since you're not being harmed and it involves someone else's child.)\n\nIt might smooth things over to go to Eliza and your dad and say you didn't mean to surprise them, and ask them how they feel about Ben learning Spanish. It's an incredibly valuable thing for him to know! Depending on where he grows up, it will increase his ability to interact with the world around him! It will also be good for future career prospects, and being multilingual has been shown to cognitively benefit kiddos. \n\nIt probably surprised Eliza to hear 'quiero mas jugo' or something similar instead of the English equivalent, and she might feel guilty also for leaving her son with you so much that he learned a whole ass new language. I think some compassion might go a long way, here.", "Ben is 2 months old? Baby\u2019s of 2 months make no other sounds than crying\u2026", "Ben is 2 months old?

Honestly maybe let things cool off then try to speak to her and your father with reason. You should not have to edit yourself around your family. They should be thankful for what you do for them.

I'm from the province of Friesland in the Netherlands, we used to be our own country and have our own language alongside Dutch (everyone also speaks Dutch) Friesian is also officially the second native language in the Netherlands, although some people here like to joke around about it being \"just a weird accent\" Usually Friesians are proud of their heritage and language, but there are also parents being very weird about their kid speaking or learning it, afraid their Dutch pronunciations might suffer or something like that. While that may be true for some kids, as said above, mostly people benefit in more than one way from being able to speak/know more than one language. I will never understand those parents being so against another language and even more so when it's their own native language (especially in the case of Friesian, since it is slowly dying out) But here we are... some Friesian born and raised parents making sure their kids will only speak Dutch. Which they will learn anyway since that's the main national language. I know the Friesian language really doesn't mean anything when you compare it to a language like English, but even so, bilingualism strengthens cognitive abilities.

They can be more open-minded, and they also find it easier to focus on a variety of tasks simultaneously.)", "And it would be a huge wasted opportunity, because children that young learn languages more quickly and easily than do older children and adults.", "I do it for free, but they'll usually leave money for food or something if I don't feel like cooking for the two of us.", "My mom wouldn\u2019t let us learn low-german (my dad\u2019s 1st language) because we might talk about her in another language she couldn\u2019t understand.
