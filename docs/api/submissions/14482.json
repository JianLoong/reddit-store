We have two daughters Angelica (5) and Sarah (three months). \n\nOur relationship has been wonderful, he's the love of my life honestly and I couldn't be happier. Although we have our differences we get along fine and he's overall an attentive partner. \n\nHowever, he has this friend, Marco m(26). They met not long ago, around three or four years, and I feel like he's a bad influence on my husband. I won't go much into detail here but feel free to ask. \n\nMy husband told me quite honestly that he didn't knew if he wanted kids before our marriage, but then we got accidentally pregnant and we got married. During my first daughter's pregnancy he was kinda dismissive of me, not to the point of being hostile but he wasn't head over heals for being a parent like I was. He didn't really wanted to be in the delivery room because he said it wasn't for him, but he still did it to support me though it. \n\nAfter Angelica was born things improved. Shortly after I told him that I wanted to have more babies. He wasn't sure of it and it became an ongoing argument between us, until he basically gave in and agreed.\n\nHe was dismissive during the pregnancy again, although we had spoke about it and I agreed that he would be able to continue with his hobbies and occasional trips as usual. \n\nHowever three months ago our daughter was born. I was home with my eldest daughter alone when I went into labor. He was with Marco, he didn't exactly told me where he eas going, he just left early. I tried calling him but his phone was turned off. I gave up on the idea and called my mom. She drove home and then drove us to the hospital. There I was in the hospital calling him, we called my family and his, soon everyone was there helping me find my husband, but his phone was still turned off. \n\nAfter around 2/3 hours I couldn't hold it anylonger  and I had to go into the delivery room without him. We were all extremely worried about him and that only added to my stress about giving birth. Anyway at some point he got there and waited with our families outside. \n\nI was fuming, of course. Not only because he missed our daughter's birth, but also because his hair was wet and you know what that means. I didn't wanted to believe it. Luckily it was just the hormones making me imagine stuff. \n\nTwo days ago we were arguing because he's planning a trip with Marco next week. Things got a little heated and he was leaving to get some fresh air because he didn't want to argue in front of our daughters. Then I said something like \"leave, you're never there for us\" or something like that, he asked me why I said that and I told him he couldn't even be brothered to be there with me when our daughter was born. We continued arguing after that and he left. He's disappointed that I can't get over it even after months. Now we're not talking to each other. Am I wrong for this?\n\nSorry I realize now that this is all over the place, I'll answer questions if this is too hard to read, I'm sorry\n\n\nEdit: it's not like he was completely against the idea of having more kids, we had different sides of when and how many kids we wanted. He agreed with me that it was okay to have another one now. He loves our daughters.", "created_utc": 1681153943, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12hsrbk/aita_for_not_getting_over_my_husband_missing_our/", "score": 113, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Sounds like your husband is either in a relationship with him, or seeing someone on the side and using Marco to cover for his comings and goings. You need to hold him accountable or leave his ass.\n\nNote: Please do not have any more children with him. He didn\u2019t want kids and no one should be pressured and forced. Hopefully he\u2019ll still be a good father to the two kids you already have together.", "ESH. He didn\u2019t want children, so he never should have married you and acted like he was going to be a happy little family, and you never should have pressured him into ANOTHER child he didn\u2019t want and subjected your children to a father who doesn\u2019t want them.", "Not enough information. How many weeks were you when your second daughter was born? What was he doing? Why was his phone turned off? Did you try yo call Marco?\n\nFor now I have to go with --- because he didn't want a second child, you pushed him into it, you explicitly agreed that he could do these trips as a compromise. Now you are complaining about these trips and about him not being as excited as you are. He obviously is an AH as well, because he should have made an effort too. The extra information will define who is more the AH.\n\nWith the extra information NTA. Just naive.\n\nEdit: update vote", "I don't think it's the weirdest thing in the world to wonder if he's sleeping with Marco or if he's been using Marco as cover for affairs. It's also possible he's just kind of a narcissistic flake. \n\nI don't know that I'd ever get over a spouse turning off their phone at any time when I was near the end of a pregnancy. Missing the birth? That's unbelievable..\n Nevermind someone saying you need to get over it, how is he over it? He should be crushed and still making active attempts to make amends. \n\nNTA, OP.

You for pushing your husband into having another child that he did not want and was clear about. Him for agreeing to it and then not being there for you.", "ESH. Him for shutting his phone off and missing the birth, that's pretty shitty, you for arguing with him about having a second kid until he gave in. If he doesn't want another kid you should have stopped with the first surprise kid. He's shown multiple signs he doesn't want children, including saying he doesn't want children, I'm not sure what you expected to happen from someone who does not want children.\n\nEditing to add more:\n\nI fear that those two children are going to grow up in a tumultuous home life either due to an unloving father, constant fights between their mom & dad, or both. I don't think it's fair to your husband to deal with arguments so often about having a second kid, and I don't think it's fair to you to be with someone who doesn't want children. It sounds like he's no longer living a life he wants, and you two remain together because both of you may not have considered separating as an option. He may have, hence being with marco with his cell phone off (who knows, that's speculation on my end), but maybe you should consider the future of your relationship and if he's really capable of raising children with you now that you have two that are going to rely on some sense of stability as they grow up.

I'm assuming getting married when you were pregnant was your idea, too? Getting married bc of a pregnancy is NEVER a healthy reason. \n\nMarco's being in the picture only exacerbates the dynamic between the two of you bc your husband gets to be free with him, and at home, he is forced to be a father. Even if he loves his kids now, he still might not like being a father, which may lead to him resenting his kids and, in turn, making the relationship between them toxic af. I would seriously consider that none of this was in your husband's life plans. \n\nI see divorce in your future, bc by the way you described him treating you throughout the pregnancies, he already resents the hell out of you. You two need counseling. IMMEDIATELY.", "You are the side piece.  You get that, right?", "NTA when he has his phone turned off while he has a very pregnant wife.

Then he chose to be unavailable when you were at the end of your pregnancy so he wound up missing the birth. Of course you should be pissed. You want a devoted family man. Your husband is not it.

You can't berate someone into wanting more children and then expect him to be over the moon about it. But then again, I guess it takes 2 to make a baby so back to him being the AH.

Birth control can fail, for sure, but that + all the context you talk about in your OP and comments does not make it sound like a coincidence.\n2) Your husband is having something with Marco, it's clear as a day. It might be sex, or it might be he is just scaping from you... because it looks like if he goes home you will want to convince him to keep having babies and he obviously doesn't have the guts to stand his ground. I think all your comments saying you trust him are lies, and you are freaking out because you don't want to break your beautiful family... But I think your family has been broken since the first baby. I'm so sorry about this, but it might be healthy for you all to distance yourselves fro each other. \n3) Your husband sucks for not being supportive enough during your pregnancy, before and after. Whether he wanted the babies or not, they exist and they should be taken care of properly. What he did during the birth it's not properly taking care of a baby (and their mother). Your feelings are valid about this, but you should do more tha just having arguments over it. You should either factually prove he is cheating (a comment told you what can you do about this and you brushed it off... Now go back and take note) or you should just take the L and proceed with a divorce. This does not look healthier either of you. You can ask him... But again, he can very easily make you believe anything he wanted because you seem very VERY gullible. I wouldn't trust his word.", "ESH.

NTA. Your husband is. He made a series of choices that led to his wife having to hunt down support and worried about him. That said, there is no good reason for him to have turned off his phone. None of this passes the sniff test for me. Something \"no good\" is going on. Whether it is sex, drugs or something else, I don't know but something is very off in his behavior.\n\nYou need to figure out where your line in the sand is.
