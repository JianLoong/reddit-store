For her to be rude to you while you're doing her a favor you don't have to do is just disrespectful.

She pushed the limits, and you showed her where those limits stop. Good for you. NTA", "NTA.  Driver picks the music, Shotgun shuts their cake hole.", "NTA. Your car, your rules. She shouldn't have questioned you in the first place. And then her comment about you being \"raised wrong\" was totally unacceptable. She sounds spoiled. If she isn't going to appreciate the things you do, she doesn't deserve them.", "NTA. Stop giving her rides unless you absolutely have to. If she can get there by bike, she can ride her bike. And the least she can for having you cart her around everywhere is not argue about music and let you listen to whatever you want.", "NTA, but your mom and sister are. SisTeri should be grateful you were available last minute and just in general driving her. Two, your mom absolutely needs to weigh in and tell your sister if she\u2019s so unhappy with you driving her then she can find alternative transportation, thirdly, it\u2019s a universal constant that the driver controls the music.", "NTA, but just don't turn the radio on a tall.\n\nNeither of you likes the other's music, so just don't have anything on at all.", "Little sister wants to fuck around, she can find out. NTA.", "NTA. Driver picks the music is how I was raised. And you even offered a good compromise of the radio. \n\nAlso, beggars can't be choosers. You're doing her a favor and she can be polite.", "NTA, but my favorite part of this was \n\n>most teenagers her age\n\nLol, you're only two years older than her. I get that your point was that she can't legally drive yet, but still. I laughed.", "Nta you were doing her a favor.  Don't bite the hand that feeds you, kid.", "Earphones.", "[removed]", "Ish, In your situation, it's understandable why you felt frustrated and chose to turn the car around, but it's also important to consider the broader context of your relationship with your sister and the responsibilities involved.  \nYour sister's comment was disrespectful, especially considering that you were doing her a favor by driving her. It's reasonable to expect gratitude and respect in such a situation. However, turning the car around after a disagreement about music might be seen as an overreaction, especially since it directly affected her ability to attend her practice.  \nIt's good that you usually try to accommodate her music preferences, but as the driver, it's also fair for you to choose the music sometimes. The key here is compromise. A more measured response might have been to explain why her comment was hurtful and discuss how both of you can make the car rides more enjoyable for each other, rather than abruptly ending the trip.  \nYour action of turning the car around was a clear statement that you felt taken for granted. However, it's important to balance standing up for yourself with understanding the impact of your actions. In this case, your sister missed her practice, which could have been important to her.  \nIn terms of whether you're the a\\*\\*hole, it's a bit of a gray area. Your feelings of frustration and wanting respect are valid, but the way you handled the situation could have been better. It might be helpful to have a calm conversation with your sister about mutual respect and how to handle disagreements in the future. This could help prevent similar conflicts and strengthen your relationship.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
