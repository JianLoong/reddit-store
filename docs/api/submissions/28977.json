I felt like I was personally TA. She did not blame me. She\u2019s okay, but I am not okay with our friendship at this moment. \n\n1. To clarify, my friend is 38 years old. 10 years older than me.\n2. She made the \u201cpity invite\u201d comment towards me. As in I (OptimistPrime) was invited by my friend Dana out of pity. Not that Sarah was invited by me out of pity. \n3. I did try to physically grab Sarah at one point.\n4. I should\u2019ve let bar security know she was over-served, and caused a scene over the guy repeatedly swatting at me. \n\n\nMy friend Dana had her birthday celebration last night in downtown Dallas. Knowing my friend Sarah could use a night out, I brought her along.\n\nEverything was fine until I noticed Sarah was getting very drunk, very quickly. Guys were constantly sending her shots and drinks. There was this one guy who brushed my hand away when I tried to check on her. I gave him a clear \"back off\" in return. Like, seriously, don't touch me. He backed off for a bit, and we went back to chilling. I was the designated driver, so I was fine with her having a good time.\n\nThen, she vanished. My friends asked where Sarah went. I called her several times, anxious, pacing in and out of the bar trying to reach her. When she finally answered, I could hear the guy who pushed my hand away. He told me to stop calling, and I heard Sarah laughing in the background. I asked to speak with her, and she said, \"I'm right here, outside the bar. Why are you so upset?\" But I was outside, & she was nowhere to be seen. She hung up.\n\nBack inside the bar, I called her a few more times, but there was no response. I stepped outside again. And there, I saw her making out with the guy. I went to check if she was okay, & once again, the guy pushed me away. By now, he knew my name & said, \u201cshe doesn\u2019t want to go home with you, OptimistPrimeBarista,\u201d with this weird grin.\n\nI asked if I could take her home or if she'd come back inside the bar with me. AND AGAIN, the guy swatted me away.\n\nI explained that my friends were concerned for her. She responded, \u201coh, you mean the one friend who invited you out of pity?\u201d Then she screamed at me to go home, that she didn\u2019t want to leave with me, that I was a terrible friend, & she didn't have fun with me. \n\nThey walked away & I closed my tab. I walked around the bars trying to find her. She didn\u2019t answer my calls. It was 1:30 am in & I was alone so I walked to my car. I was halfway home when she called me, asking where I was. \u201cI\u2019m on my way home.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat? You can\u2019t just leave me here. What do you mean you\u2019re going home?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou told me to go home repeatedly, so that\u2019s what I did. I am more than happy to come back to pick you up but it\u2019ll take me about 20 minutes.\u201d\n\n\u201c20 minutes? You\u2019re gaslighting me. You left me stranded on the street!\u201d\n\nI could hear the same guy with her & I could tell they were inside a bar. She wasn\u2019t stranded. \n\nBut at this point I had around to pick her up, but she told me to leave her alone. So, I headed back home. Again. \n\nI stayed up until 3 am & kept calling her. I was sobbing in bed with my boyfriend because I just wanted her to be safe & I didn\u2019t want anything to happen to her. I feel so guilty for leaving her. My bf said I tried my best to get her back home & it\u2019s not my fault. He also said it was dangerous for me to be alone in Deep Ellum so late at night (IYKYK) & that I had to make sure I was safe, too. \n\nAm I the asshole for leaving my friend?", "created_utc": 1697381514, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/178h1ex/aita_for_leaving_my_friend_stranded_in_downtown/", "score": 126, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You did what you could.  She had less interest in her own safety than you did.  Also, your BF is right - her safety comes after yours.

It was clear she wasn't going to do that.  You turned around when she called you.  I would have told her to get an Uber and not go out with her again.

That guy must have developed his personality exclusively from watching 90s Frat guy movies\u2026 You did the best you could, left, came back, did the best you could AGAIN, and then cried about it. Sometimes situations are just hopeless and you can only throw yourself against a brick wall so many times, so to speak. That situation probably ended badly, but you did everything you could and more.", "NTA\n\nand your friend is terrible.", "NTA. You undertook all reasonable steps to help her but she rejected your offers of assistance. It sucks for her, feeling stranded but she rudely sent you away when it was convenient for her.

Others have suggested things you could have done, but they were not there.

You did your best under those circumstances, but you probably want to go low contact with Sarah when there is alcohol involved.", "NTA...but Sarah possibly needs to read this because she may not realize how dangerous her situation could have been, and I'm guessing that one of the reasons it didn't turn out badly was that the guy did realize, on some level, that she had friends trying to look out for her, and they were people who could be witnesses against him if he stepped too far over the line.", "NAH.

You should have altered the staff about the creep.", "YTA. You **never** strand a friend so drunk that she\u2019s being belligerent and also at high risk for being taken advantage of. I get it\u2019s super annoying, but that\u2019s straight friend code you broke.\n\nEdit: Drag her away, call the other people they were out with, get a bouncer involved, whatever it takes. \n\nI was drugged once at a bar.

That man was clearly a predator, in the future when he takes her outside and swats you away you grab/yank the friend away and make a scene if need be. I can understand as well how it might be a lot scarier to do that when it's just one individual. \n\nAlso where was  the rest of the group and why were they not involved or concerned?", "YTA\n\nA friend that drunk cannot reasonably consent, and that guy KNEW that, which is why he kept pushing you away. \n\nAt that point, you should have grabbed her and dragged her away.  If you were concerned with how that guy would have reacted, you go back into the bar and ask for help to get your friend. \n\nThen you immediately go home.  \n\nWhatever happens when everyone is sober, you deal with it then, AFTER everyone is home safe.", "ESH something had to happen to send her down that \"I was only invited out of pity\" spiral and you never leave a woman behind.

That\u2019s why I went into every. fucking. bar. I was out of my mind and failed to grab a bouncer. I get that. I agree.\n\nI also had to make sure I was fucking safe and wasn\u2019t it a position to be sexually assaulted.", "One of the hardest things to navigate (I think) as a young adult is learning that you can\u2019t trust people. It doesn\u2019t sound like you can trust this woman if she can\u2019t even be trusted to look out for herself. It\u2019s one thing when you have a little too much every once in awhile, but consistently doing so when you are a belligerent drunk is reckless. She sounds like a dateline episode waiting to happen.\n\nI would really start to distance myself if I were you. Is this someone who would take care of you if the situations were reversed? Is this someone who would have your back if you needed them? Trust means so many different things, but it\u2019s the foundation of every relationship. I had \u201cfriends\u201d like this in college and we are very much not friends today. It sounds like you have a lot of anxiety and stress stemming from this friend holding you accountable for her actions. That\u2019s not friendship. Good luck, and I hope you can figure out where to go from here!"]}
