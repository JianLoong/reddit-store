She made the \u201cpity invite\u201d comment towards me. As in I (OptimistPrime) was invited by my friend Dana out of pity. Not that Sarah was invited by me out of pity. \n3. I did try to physically grab Sarah at one point.\n4. I should\u2019ve let bar security know she was over-served, and caused a scene over the guy repeatedly swatting at me. \n\nMy friend Dana had her birthday celebration last night in downtown Dallas. Knowing my friend Sarah could use a night out, I brought her along.\n\nEverything was fine until I noticed Sarah was getting very drunk, very quickly. Guys were constantly sending her shots and drinks. There was this one guy who brushed my hand away when I tried to check on her. I gave him a clear \"back off\" in return. Like, seriously, don't touch me. He backed off for a bit, and we went back to chilling. I was the designated driver, so I was fine with her having a good time.\n\nThen, she vanished. My friends asked where Sarah went. I called her several times, anxious, pacing in and out of the bar trying to reach her. When she finally answered, I could hear the guy who pushed my hand away. He told me to stop calling, and I heard Sarah laughing in the background. I asked to speak with her, and she said, \"I'm right here, outside the bar. Why are you so upset?\" But I was outside, & she was nowhere to be seen. She hung up.\n\nBack inside the bar, I called her a few more times, but there was no response. I stepped outside again. And there, I saw her making out with the guy. I went to check if she was okay, & once again, the guy pushed me away. By now, he knew my name & said, \u201cshe doesn\u2019t want to go home with you, OptimistPrimeBarista,\u201d with this weird grin.\n\nI asked if I could take her home or if she'd come back inside the bar with me. AND AGAIN, the guy swatted me away.\n\nI explained that my friends were concerned for her. She responded, \u201coh, you mean the one friend who invited you out of pity?\u201d Then she screamed at me to go home, that she didn\u2019t want to leave with me, that I was a terrible friend, & she didn't have fun with me. \n\nThey walked away & I closed my tab. I walked around the bars trying to find her. She didn\u2019t answer my calls. It was 1:30 am in & I was alone so I walked to my car. I was halfway home when she called me, asking where I was. \u201cI\u2019m on my way home.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat? You can\u2019t just leave me here. What do you mean you\u2019re going home?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou told me to go home repeatedly, so that\u2019s what I did. I am more than happy to come back to pick you up but it\u2019ll take me about 20 minutes.\u201d\n\n\u201c20 minutes? You\u2019re gaslighting me. You left me stranded on the street!\u201d\n\nI could hear the same guy with her & I could tell they were inside a bar. She wasn\u2019t stranded. \n\nBut at this point I had around to pick her up, but she told me to leave her alone. So, I headed back home. Again. \n\nI stayed up until 3 am & kept calling her. I was sobbing in bed with my boyfriend because I just wanted her to be safe & I didn\u2019t want anything to happen to her. I feel so guilty for leaving her. My bf said I tried my best to get her back home & it\u2019s not my fault. He also said it was dangerous for me to be alone in Deep Ellum so late at night (IYKYK) & that I had to make sure I was safe, too. \n\nAm I the asshole for leaving my friend?", "created_utc": 1697381514, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/178h1ex/aita_for_leaving_my_friend_stranded_in_downtown/", "score": 66, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You did what you could.  She had less interest in her own safety than you did.  Also, your BF is right - her safety comes after yours.  I suppose the real question is what you could have done that you didn't do.  Drag her to the car?  That could have resulted in a physical altercation with the guy.  Tell her she has to go with you?  It was clear she wasn't going to do that.  You turned around when she called you.  I would have told her to get an Uber and not go out with her again.  Her behavior just needs the wrong person for it to become tragic.", "NTA - you did more than most would have.  Maybe next time though, let bar security know what\u2019s going on.  They can intervene if someone is being over served/incapacitated!", "NTA - you didnt leave her stranded, you went above and beyond to try and get her home or make sure she was safe. Unfortunately she couldn\u2019t be reasoned with and there was really not much left for you to do.", "You are NTA. That guy must have developed his personality exclusively from watching 90s Frat guy movies\u2026 You did the best you could, left, came back, did the best you could AGAIN, and then cried about it. Sometimes situations are just hopeless and you can only throw yourself against a brick wall so many times, so to speak. That situation probably ended badly, but you did everything you could and more.", "NTA\n\nand your friend is terrible.", "NTA. You undertook all reasonable steps to help her but she rejected your offers of assistance. It sucks for her, feeling stranded but she rudely sent you away when it was convenient for her. Your boyfriend is the voice of reason you ought to heed.", "Sarah is not your friend. NTA, but don\u2019t invite this person anywhere again. At her big age she gets drunk enough to where she\u2019s behaving this badly?\n\nNope \ud83e\udee0", "Nta. It\u2019s not your responsibility to make sure someone can handle their liquor. Not to mention it sounds like your \u201cfriend\u201d was extremely rude to you for trying to help. She made her bed, now she has to lay in it", "Deep Ellum???  Girl! \nAnyway. NTA. You tried. Short of physically dragging away, I don\u2019t know what else you could have done.", "Nta. My friend group has the rule we come together, we leave together. But yout tried to get her to leave and she wouldn't, and she let some incel swat at you. I would rethink that friendship.", "NTA - You tried several times over the period of a few hours. Others have suggested things you could have done, but they were not there. Sometimes when we are in emotional distress (as it sounds that you were), we cannot think of every possible thing that can be done. You did your best under those circumstances, but you probably want to go low contact with Sarah when there is alcohol involved.", "NTA...but Sarah possibly needs to read this because she may not realize how dangerous her situation could have been, and I'm guessing that one of the reasons it didn't turn out badly was that the guy did realize, on some level, that she had friends trying to look out for her, and they were people who could be witnesses against him if he stepped too far over the line.", "NAH.  You aren't her babysitter she's a grown woman", "Nta, just leave people like this. There is no point getting stressed over her", "ESH- this guy was being physical with you, swatting you away. I would have told security that he physically touched you and was taking advantage of your friend. \n\nThis guy sounds like he\u2019s probably been an issue with people before, security may have even known him.\n\nWorst case scenario he drugged her and took advantage, best case scenario your friend is a bad drunk and nothing happened to her.\n\nThis whole thing sucked.", "I used to bartend in deep ellum, and I'm going with YTA. You should have altered the staff about the creep.", "YTA. You **never** strand a friend so drunk that she\u2019s being belligerent and also at high risk for being taken advantage of. I get it\u2019s super annoying, but that\u2019s straight friend code you broke.\n\nEdit: Drag her away, call the other people they were out with, get a bouncer involved, whatever it takes. \n\nI was drugged once at a bar. I\u2019m thankful the friends I was with made sure I got out safely. One of our crew legit put me over his shoulder to get me in the car. And had he not been there? My girlfriends said they would have gotten a bouncer to get me out. \n\nThey didn\u2019t know I was drugged. They had no clue how much I drank (2 drinks over several hours only). They could have said \u2018oh Spare-Article-396 is an adult and can make their own choices\u2019 but they didn\u2019t. The next day they were all \u2018wtf was that?\u2019 And then I told them it wasn\u2019t me being drunk. I\u2019m so grateful for them. \n\nAnd to all the NTAs; my loyalty in friendship is obviously much deeper than yours. So you do you.", "Esh. She got out of line but she was clearly wasted. That man was clearly a predator, in the future when he takes her outside and swats you away you grab/yank the friend away and make a scene if need be. I can understand as well how it might be a lot scarier to do that when it's just one individual. \n\nAlso where was  the rest of the group and why were they not involved or concerned?", "YTA\n\nA friend that drunk cannot reasonably consent, and that guy KNEW that, which is why he kept pushing you away. \n\nAt that point, you should have grabbed her and dragged her away.  If you were concerned with how that guy would have reacted, you go back into the bar and ask for help to get your friend. \n\nThen you immediately go home.  \n\nWhatever happens when everyone is sober, you deal with it then, AFTER everyone is home safe.", "ESH something had to happen to send her down that \"I was only invited out of pity\" spiral and you never leave a woman behind. You come together you leave together. Even if you never take her anywhere ever again, you don't leave.\nShe over drank and got obnoxious. Worst shit ever to deal w/ tbh", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.
