EDIT: he is her stepfather and has only known her since she was 17. \n\nOkay so I (47F) found out earlier today that my daughter (19F) let\u2019s call her Jane and husband (53M) John have been sleeping together since her 18th birthday. She is pregnant but not by him. The whole situation is even worse since she\u2019s in a long term relationship with her boyfriend of 4 years.\n\n    It was around 2 in the morning when I found out that Jane and John had been sleeping together when I went through his phone. I had seen explicit text messages and photos dating back to over a year ago. As soon as I had seen those, I woke my husband up and started screaming. He was denying everything so I went into my daughters room and woke her up.\n\n   She admitted everything about how they\u2019ve been in a romantic relationship since she was 18. I couldn\u2019t talk. I didn\u2019t know what to do. I stood there for about 2 minutes before I spoke a word. The only thing I said was \u201cboth of you pack your bags and get the fuck out. If you\u2019re not out in 30 minutes I\u2019m calling the cops\u201d and watched as they packed their things and left. \n\n    The next morning after they left I went to the store and got what I needed to change the locks. Both of them have tried coming back and I won\u2019t answer the door. I\u2019m getting texts from my husbands family and they\u2019re calling me a whole bunch of names and saying I\u2019m wrong for kicking them out with no where to go. Everyone is saying how I should at least let my daughter back in the house until she can live on her own because she\u2019s pregnant . Should I let her back?

She knew him at 17 and they started sleeping together when she was 18. She is grown enough to know that her actions were wrong. She also is in a 4-year relationship with someone. What needs to happen is a DNA test that could determine who the father is and I would be updating her boyfriend, sending proof, and ensuring he requests a DNA test immediately. You need to ignore your soon-to-be ex-husband's family bullying you, inform them of the situation, and seek a divorce attorney. The fact that they both tried to enter the home when you kicked them out is questionable. Look after yourself first! Husband can kick rocks and your daughter can learn to be an independent adult, especially since she is bringing in a child to this world.", "At this point, I think the question of who\u2019s the asshole here is irrelevant. Next steps? Call the cops regardless and ensure your daughter receives medical care. If they\u2019re admitting they slept together on her 18th birthday, I can guarantee dude was inappropriate before then. He\u2019s the asshole, and you and your daughter were both hurt. Don\u2019t force her into a relationship with this abuser by abandoning her now.", "NTA.  Daughter groomed by Husband ..  wouldn't blame you for never speaking to her again. Are you sure baby isn't his?  It's times like this where lies are told to muddy the waters a wee bit. Hope you have let the boyfriend know he has a slice of this drama to deal with too..", "ESH, it makes sense you feel betrayed by your daughter but she is a victim of your husband. If you dont want to see her again, then thats fair, but as she is still your child you should still try to support her a bit with helping her find a place to stay and a therapist. divorce your husband.", "Nta for kicking your daughter out for sleeping with your husband.  Legally kicking him out depends on whether he owns the home or not.  If it's legally his then you may need to leave yourself rather than make him leave.  But if it is completely legally your home then you absolutely stick to your guns.   She's your daughter and her baby is your grandchild no matter what so you may want to consider whether she's safe and healthy on your decisions.  But definitely NTA and I'm so sorry for your situation.", "Your husband groomed her. She's just a teenager. Kick that filth out and bring your daughter home", "Your husband, and I assume her stepdad groomed her. So why blame her?", "Don\u2019t quit your day job.", "Yes, you should be live streaming and capitalizing on the Prego porn.", "YTA because your husband sounds predatory", "NTA\nBye bye Hubby.\n\nFor your daughter, I think you need to find out more.  How did it start? Was she coerced, threatened?  Did anything happen prior to 18 even if it wasn't intercourse?  \n\nIf she is not showing emotional trauma now, she will at some point, she should probably get some counseling.\n\nMy hope is that you and your daughter can repair your relationship.", "NTA. They were both adults and made the decision to betray you in the worst way possible. There are consequences to their choices, and this is one of them. I hope you can patch things up with your daughter in time, but if distance is what you need right now, take it. Those people telling you that you should let your daughter back in because she's pregnant are welcome to house her if they are concerned.", "Info: please tell us that the daughter is not your husband's child? I.e. it's your daughter and his stepdaughter.", "NTA\n\nWhat step dad has done with your daughter was morally wrong and massively disrespectful to you and you are right to boot him out. Not sure that throwing out a venerable pregnant young woman on to the streets was a good idea. You should make sure she has somewhere safe to live, maybe with a relative while you sort out your own feelings.\n\nYou say the baby isn't Step Dads, I assume it is the BF's, sadly when BF finds out she slept with Step Dad he will dump her as well.", "NTA. They made their bed, they can sleep in it (elsewhere). They aren't your dependents to support. \n\nIf you let her back into your home, know that she's going to want to have visitors. Those visitors are going to include your (ex!)husband.", "Nta. Give her referrals for a local women\u2019s shelter until you can figure out something permanent.

No 18 year old girl looks at a 50 year old guy lustfully. 30 year olds maybe... 50 year olds? Not without some serious manipulation on his part.", "I\u2019m not blaming her, that is definitely something I\u2019ve thought about. I\u2019m just so confused and don\u2019t know what to do. This is a situation I never thought I\u2019d see myself in", "Op just found out her husband and daughter are sleeping together. No one in this kind of situation can be expected to make any sane decisions. Even if the husband groomed the daughter, which I believe be did, op probably won't be able to believe it and act accordingly until the daughter realise she was groomed. And with the daughter being pregnant what are the chances she is not going to want to leave the husband now? The situation sucks but lets not blame op for kicking out her daughter. It's a huge shock and betrayal and something that op might not be able to get over anytime soon", "But no 18 year old would be okay cheating on an existing boyfriend. She's definitely been manipulated but is not innocent either.", "Kicking her out indicates you blame her.she needs help.", "She is 100% not innocent and knows better. If she was being groomed at her big ass age she would have known better, communicating her issues with her mother. She better hope that the baby isn't her step daddies!"]}
