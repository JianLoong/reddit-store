It's sort of a point-missing assessment of the situation. \n\nIf you ask me, lecturing someone about their own religion when you admittedly know very little about that religion is an asshole move and maybe a sign to drink a little less at parties.\n\nEdit: I actually don't know where yoga comes from but always assumed it originated in Hinduism. It absolutely was popularized in the US during a time when people were actively seeking out what they would have broadly termed Eastern spiritual practices. This is well documented.
