One person on a planet of 8 billion people has one opinion and most likely no one else will have the exact same opinion.

You can practice your religion how you wish, and she was entirely wrong in telling you otherwise.", "NTA.

She deserved to be called out for her rudeness.", "NTA. Yoga is totally associated with Hinduism.", "NTA she was both an AH and incorrect.", "NTA - A made an opinion on something with having very little knowledge on the subject sadly we see it more and more these days", "NTA. It is a part of hinduism but i know a lot of people aren't aware because it was packaged as more of a spirituality/culture thing, dissociated from religion to the west so they can accept it, hence the ignorance.", "NTA but learn to get your point across without shouting at women. Until the last comment she made, it seemed to be an interesting conversation though.", "NTA.

This is a surprisingly common misconception of course the practice comes to the US and most of the world  through Hinduism and it's incredibly easy to look up. This is as silly as when people try to claim Christmas isn't really a Christian holiday because people who aren't Christians enjoy celebrating it, especially in Japan. It's sort of a point-missing assessment of the situation. \n\nIf you ask me, lecturing someone about their own religion when you admittedly know very little about that religion is an asshole move and maybe a sign to drink a little less at parties.\n\nEdit: I actually don't know where yoga comes from but always assumed it originated in Hinduism. It absolutely was popularized in the US during a time when people were actively seeking out what they would have broadly termed Eastern spiritual practices. This is well documented. We got yoga in every strip mall and gym because people in the last century were, like, obsessed with Hinduism and Buddhism for a bit.", "NTA how rude of her.", "NTA, I like how in fear of her practicing yoga being cultural appropriation, she decides to wrote every cultural and religious aspect of yoga as if that was better than cultural appropriation.", "NTA - your religious practice, your expertise", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
