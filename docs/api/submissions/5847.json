We dont, and usually discuss our days, but dont want to disrespect", "NTA!!", "YTA for arguing with a stupid person. The world is full of people like her, and arguing with her doesnt educate her and just makes you frustrated.", "[Relevant](https://www.facebook.com/CollegeHumor/videos/if-gandhi-took-a-yoga-class/4495466783803155/)", "NTA. It\u2019s true that there are people who do yoga purely for exercise without including the religious aspects, but saying it\u2019s not connected to Hinduism and that it didn\u2019t arise there is ridiculous.\n\nI\u2019m betting she does yoga for exercise, is a right wing religious Christian (or possibly something else not Hindu), is made incredibly uncomfortable by yoga\u2019s Hindu connection and desperately needs to convince herself that yoga has no connection to Hinduism.", "NTA. That's like saying that observant Christians need to stop associating Christmas with their religion, since so many non Christians celebrate it.", "She was also ignorant.", "I think she's doing a bad job explaining it. I get the impression she's less concerned with how op practices their religion, and more speaking generally about how your average yoga enjoyer completely divorces it from the religion. Like how most people think of Santa instead of Jesus when it comes to xmas.\n\n\nShe seems defensive like she's expecting op to tell her she shouldn't be doing yoga. So she's preemptively building a case that it's no longer that associated with the religion.", "Yea that's why a lot of schools wanted to ban it. Didn't want religion in schools", "I understand that certain muslim groups have also issued a fatwa against yoga (eg in Malaysia and indonesia) due to the links to Hinduism as it is deemed blasphemous. Though I believe it may just be limited to chanting mantras rather than the practise of yoga in general.", "I hate yoga competition. Or classes where you have to leave if you can't hold a position. It feels like it goes against the whole point of the practise. (Coming to it from a completely western pov so could be wrong, but it doesn't feel like thats the point of it!)", "It seems like she\u2019s parroting a popular narrative prevalent in the US. Part of the issue is that lots of conservative Christian folks do yoga, they teach it in PE, etc and this wouldn\u2019t be possible if it was seen as a religious practice.", "But Yoga is originated from Hinduism, it\u2019s a part of Hinduism, others are welcome to practice it non-religiously, however, they must acknowledge and respect it\u2019s origins instead of claiming it has absolutely nothing to do with religion and being wilfully ignorant about it. So disrespectful to all Hindus.", "Try looking at aseeda or laasida or maybe kheer... used to live in the Middle East and celebrated local holy days out of courtesy then because some of my friends were, like, the most amazing cooks.\n\nI always got the vague idea that Yoga was a spiritual subset of Hinduism, like Sufism is to Islam or like surfing was originally a Polynesian spiritual pastime and kabalah is a mystical subset of Judaism.\n\nOn the other hand, it is rude to yell.  Just smile and very politely say 'thank you for correcting me after 32 (or whatever number) years of doing it incorrectly' then ignore anything else that is said. Idiotic people can't be taught and I prefer simply to not deal with them.\n\nNTA", "Bingo. On the nose. Yep.", "\u201cA\u201d was soooo close. She was almost there\u2026. Then she blew right past the point and became a moron.", "I get the impression she is the \u2018white\u2019 knight type and screams cultural appropriation at people every chance she gets. If yoga came from Hinduism in her mind, she would be culturally appropriating it herself. Therefore she \u2018needs\u2019 to distance yoga from Hinduism. She\u2019s an idiot, ignore her \u2026or send her information on Hinduism with how they created yoga, then tell her she is culturally appropriating and therefore obviously she\u2019s racist. See how she handles the accusation. My bet is she looses her mind.", "NTA. I would have said way more.", "NTA you shouldn't have to apologise for other people's ignorance offending you.", "Tell her about people wearing head scarves. Oh and about atheists celebrating Christmas and Easter. She's gonna be shocked about that one. \n\nNTA\n\nDon't pay her any mind.", "NTA. Somewhat recently, there was an attempt by the catholic church to speak out against meditation, new age and yoga (etc.) and the pushback from Christians who enjoyed practicing yoga and wished to continue was (obviously) to sort of \u201cignore\u201d (if not officially denounce) yoga\u2019s origins in Hinduism. She clearly isn\u2019t aware of this part of history.", "Depends on which branch of Islam... I've heard some say that on some practices (mainly chanting) are against the tawhid. Also that some of the poses imitate animals and thus detract from the essential dignity of man. Also yoga means yoked together and thus this implies the union of gods (little g) with Allah, thus being blasphemy (I think).\n\nI think the fatwa in Malaysia was withdrawn... as long as any Muslim practicing yoga didn't chant but that big kerfluffle was a decade ago. I have no idea about now.\n\nLife is strange, religion is stranger.", "Was that meant for me or plenty?\n\nEdit: I have reread my comment, and want to further clarify what I meant because my point was lost in translation it seems. When I said A is correct up until she said that you should disassociate yoga from Hinduism, I meant that no where in her statement was she correct because that was her whole point. I was being sarcastic in saying that A is correct and tried to make that obvious by saying \"Up until\" [her entire argument]. Hope that makes sense I can see how it could come across as me agreeing with some points of A, but I'd like to clarify I don't agree with her at all.", "That makes a lot of sense. Her question about cultural appropriation really makes it sound like she's trying to reconcile multiple loyalities", "I know at least one school district banned the use of the term \"Namaste\" in yoga class because it is fundamentally a religious greeting (my spirit greets your spirit). Of course it's still ok to say \"goodbye\" (derived from God be with you) because that's fundamentally Christian.", "No, JW means Jehovah's Witnesses, ruled with an iron fist by Watchtower in New York. I assume that some Jewish people have converted to JW, but they would have to renounce their entire heritage, not even talking about it, so I could not know for sure.", "Yoga originates from and can be part of Hindu spiritual/religious practice. But not all Hindus do yoga, it's not a required aspect of the religion. Conversely, not all yoga is religious--the way it's been adapted in the secular form as exercise and mindfulness etc is connected only distantly to the religious aspect. I'm very much an atheist, and even in India most gyms/yoga studios offer the secular version primarily for exercise that benefits physical and mental health. In fact the saying \"Namaste\" and \"Om\" during yoga classes is something I've only seen in the West, never in any yoga classes I've done in India, where it's treated far more matter of factly and as an everyday (read: non-exotic) thing--no rituals or chants or what say you \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffe\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nOP's friend is an ignoramus. One freaking Google search would have taught her about yoga's origins, ffs. OP you are NTA.", "NTA - Wait until she hears about Christmas trees.", "Not exactly the same because of a lot of the stuff done during Christmas are forms of cultural appropriation from other religions.", "I married into a Hindu Brahmin family.  Trust me.  There's plenty of exclusion and judgment. Just ask Indian Muslims.", "Oh I see. Thanks for the advice. I think I know enough about my own religion.", "I'm a Hindu. \nAnd I know what I'm talking about. Your google search results are wrong. \nMaybe pickup a textbook on the history of Hinduism. \nHow can dvaita and advaita be part of a same religion? How can Buddhism be part for Hinduism? Hinduism is full of contradictions. It appropriated everything that existed in India before its \"birth\" *150* years ago.\nHad it not been for adisankara and the british, there would be no Hinduism today. It exists only because Indian state doesn't allow one to be anything other than Hindu, Muslim, christian or a Parsi. The law says, atheists are a part of Hinduism too. It is just madness.", "My entire immediate family skipped my wedding because, as my mother told me, they were worried that I might have it in a non-JW church. (JWs are not allowed to even enter a non-JW church for fear that Satan will possess them.) I had it at my house just so they would feel free to come, but they had worked themselves up so much about the *possibility* that I might have it in a non-JW church that they just wouldn't attend or have anything to do with it.\n\nMy non-JW aunt was my only family in attendance and afterwards my mother switched her \"reason\" for not attending was that my aunt was there, whom she didn't like and thought was possessed by demons because she read Stephen King novels.\n\nJehovah's Witnesses are really weird. They have these fake Stepford Wives smiles on all the time, but they mostly just drink a lot.", "And so do I. I\u2019m also a Hindu. Your argument is still factually incorrect."]}
