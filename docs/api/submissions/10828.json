She would post half naked photos of my child, she stole probably 200 photos off of my Facebook page, and she prints these photos out and posts them around her house. \n\nAll of that doesn\u2019t really seem like a problem. Just a grandma loving her grand baby right? Wrong. \n\nI have younger family members with photos of my child on my Facebook. My family members, not hers. She has photos of my younger cousins holding babe around her house. She has photos of my mom holding babe around her house. She has tried to tag herself in my photos on Facebook so they show up on hers as well. \n\nI tried to talk to her, ask her not to take my photos off Facebook and I would send her photos to post as her own if she would just ask. She said sorry, that she wouldn\u2019t do it again. So I let it go. \n \nTwo months ago, just before babes first birthday, she posted an online album of my daughter. 125 photos in this album. 120 of them from my Facebook.

I\u2019m to nervous about the creeps of the internet. Buy my MIL doesn\u2019t care. She had 5 naked photos of babe in that book. \n\nSo, two months ago, the day the album was posted, I blocked her.

Like I don\u2019t think spanking worked actually lol ugh. \nThis was my grandma in law too though - with the sharing of my baby\u2019s photos. Like why do people do that without asking permission?

Your MIL does not expect normal boundaries and this is a flagrant abuse of your privacy.  It is frankly weird that she has printed off and put on Facebook all the photos of your extended family and not just her side, and  putting up photos of your extended family in her home.  You asked her to stop, she agreed then did it anyway, and some were inappropriate.  How can you be sure that she won\u2019t find a way to get them from someone else in your husband\u2019s family?  I know it will take time, but I believe there are policies and processes to get these images removed since she doesn\u2019t have permission to post them, so please look into that.  I would tell her to remove those photos right now and generally LC her.  If she doesn\u2019t remove them, NC her for this extreme violation of privacy because she has no respect for your wishes.", "NTA.

You know your MIL is sharing that but you have no idea what everyone else in your friends list does.", "Honestly, especially after she posted naked pics of your child, and the rough ones of you in a vulnerable state, I'd have gone NC on her.

You sound like you're doing everything you can and that's awesome", "That makes no sense they both have accounts she has photos on her account her husband can't use his account to block someone from her account can eat he?", "There's an option called 'restricted' that let's the account stay friended but the other person doesn't see anything unless it's public.  Or if they are tagged.  I have a good bit of my family restricted", "File DMCA violations. This is essentially asserting your copyright over these photos. Any reputable content platform will have a mechanism for doing this, and it is often taken seriously.", "So the photo in question is of me holding my daughter for the first time. You can\u2019t actually see anything but you can tell I\u2019m naked. This might sound stupid, but on fb you choose where in the lineup photos go.

Just a gentle reminder (as you\u2019ve obviously been experiencing) its out there once it\u2019s posted. One thing people in my family do is use the google photo app. You can invite people to shared galleries and this can be heavily curated to suit your needs with MIL. We use it cross phone platform but if you\u2019re both on iPhone this is also built in to the photo app. This won\u2019t stop her from sharing necessarily but it might work as a tool for a middle ground compromise of sharing some more specific photos if you keep her blocked on fb. You could also consider changing the access of your posts to limit her from some. I hope you are able to come to a smooth resolution with everything. It does sound challenging.", "but why does she have naked pictures of your child", "Screen shots over FaceTime, and ones she took in person I was unaware of."]}
