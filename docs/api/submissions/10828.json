I have quite a big extended family that I hardly ever see, so I post many photos of my child on FB (I have allll the privacy settings on, and have gone through my friends list deleting people I don\u2019t know anymore). I have about 250 friends on fb and they are all family or I know them personally. \n\nMy MIL on the other hand, has over 8000 people on fb. She has zero privacy settings and approves anyone who asks to follow her.\n\nRight after babe was born, she started stealing my photos off of my Facebook and posting them to her own (like she had taken them herself). She would post half naked photos of my child, she stole probably 200 photos off of my Facebook page, and she prints these photos out and posts them around her house. \n\nAll of that doesn\u2019t really seem like a problem. Just a grandma loving her grand baby right? Wrong. \n\nI have younger family members with photos of my child on my Facebook. My family members, not hers. She has photos of my younger cousins holding babe around her house. She has photos of my mom holding babe around her house. She has tried to tag herself in my photos on Facebook so they show up on hers as well. \n\nI tried to talk to her, ask her not to take my photos off Facebook and I would send her photos to post as her own if she would just ask. She said sorry, that she wouldn\u2019t do it again. So I let it go. \n \nTwo months ago, just before babes first birthday, she posted an online album of my daughter. 125 photos in this album. 120 of them from my Facebook. My mother, my grandma, my aunts, and cousins (minors who\u2019s parents have let me know they do not want their photos on her page) are all in this book for over 8000 people to see. Also in this book, is my photos from having my child. Me, no pants, no clothes, looking very rough (I almost didn\u2019t make it, I had a hemorrhage) so those photos are very personal yet she posts them for so many people to see. \n\nI don\u2019t post photos of my daughter without being clothed. I\u2019m to nervous about the creeps of the internet. Buy my MIL doesn\u2019t care. She had 5 naked photos of babe in that book. \n\nSo, two months ago, the day the album was posted, I blocked her. My husband was on board and so was my SIL.

I\u2019m just distinguishing cluelessness from being an AH.", "And I'm telling you she can't be clueless because OP has made her stance perfectly clear, and MIL's initial \"apology\" wasn't genuine because she not only continued disrespecting OP, she then began harassing them for standing up to her clearly asshole behaviors.", "We have different reads on the situation. It\u2019s OK. I\u2019m not taking everything the OP says at complete face value."]}
