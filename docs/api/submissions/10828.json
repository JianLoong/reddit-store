She would post half naked photos of my child, she stole probably 200 photos off of my Facebook page, and she prints these photos out and posts them around her house. \n\nAll of that doesn\u2019t really seem like a problem. Just a grandma loving her grand baby right? Wrong. \n\nI have younger family members with photos of my child on my Facebook. My family members, not hers. She has photos of my younger cousins holding babe around her house. She has photos of my mom holding babe around her house. She has tried to tag herself in my photos on Facebook so they show up on hers as well. \n\nI tried to talk to her, ask her not to take my photos off Facebook and I would send her photos to post as her own if she would just ask. She said sorry, that she wouldn\u2019t do it again. So I let it go. \n \nTwo months ago, just before babes first birthday, she posted an online album of my daughter. 125 photos in this album. 120 of them from my Facebook.

I\u2019m to nervous about the creeps of the internet. Buy my MIL doesn\u2019t care. She had 5 naked photos of babe in that book. \n\nSo, two months ago, the day the album was posted, I blocked her.

I would honestly contact a lawyer and have them send a letter demanding she removes all pictures, and I wouldn't even see her anymore. That's how furious and disgusted I would be if it were me. My threshold is apparently way lower than yours.\n\nNTA.", "By trying to be an influencer, I mean she\u2019s taking random videos of her driving, cooking, or the weather and posts them to her fb. This only started two weeks ago though which is why it wasn\u2019t included in my original post. I mentioned it to show she does know how fb works", "I'm so sorry to hear that. I wish I had another answer for you. Good luck.", "> She has photos that she screenshots through video chats (my daughter hates clothes and is usually naked at home) or ones she has taken herself when visiting. \n\nSo how does blocking her on FB help for these types of photos?", "Did you just say that because you have such a big family you have to have more pictures? Can you explain your logic?", "Because it was a consequence for her actions when she expected none.

But even if it was she was warned not to do it and continually did it.", "Has she been doing better about posting because she\u2019s blocked and you can\u2019t see what she posts? \n\nAccording to you, your FB page was not the source of the naked kid photos. She still has the same access as before\u2026", "She has been better and she hasn\u2019t posted a single photo of my child since. I have family members that will let me know if she posts something that crosses my boundaries. But she hasn\u2019t since I blocked her. However, she hasn\u2019t had a chance to get any photos of my daughter since I blocked her. Her only source of photos was my Facebook, herself taking them, or my husband video chatting. My husband works away most of the time and we hardly see him, and MIL won\u2019t video chat babe with me (I\u2019ve offered).  And she has not seen babe in person since before the incident"]}
