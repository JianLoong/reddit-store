HR won't necessarily deal with it properly either. If you really can't and you think she will do it again, sure, go to HR.

They might issue some kind of reprimand letter that stays on her record and then she will be constantly feeling resentful towards you. It would be great if you could just trust HR to deal with it effectively. But, that's not likely (unfortunately).", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

The car she was yelling about was parked where mail deliveries go. Definitely not an emergency.", "Kinda? My boss is, I'm nonbinary but I am afab and choose to use the women's restroom.", "Lol; would getting towed make you finish any faster?", "Ok but that's not what happened so how is it relevant?", "JFC, definitely NTA. If no one is bleeding then this is just off the charts wrong. I never know whether to advise someone to go to HR because it doesn\u2019t always make things better, but holy crap that was out of line. \n\nHonestly even just screaming in front of customers like that should get her sacked for the sake of the museum.

It's possible she just doesn't have any bathroom shyness herself (poos with the door open at home, pees in front of her girl friends, etc.) and didn't think anything of it when she asked you. \n\nIt is possible if you point out that you were embarrassed, felt voilated, etc, that she will apologize and never do it again. But again, you know her and are best equipped to know how she'll react. A reasonable boss will realize she made a miatake and correct herself. If she's not reasonable or reacts badly, then yes go to HR.", "NTA but why are you feeling embarrassed?", "It's not that drastic, she is one of 6 bosses I have and 4 are great. Maybe instead of HR I should go to them because she cares about what they think.", "This is good advice thanks. She gets sent to HR like, 3 times a month and she never gets in trouble so it probably won't do any good.", "This is actually possible. She is very open with a lot of things. I am the exact opposite. I think instead of HR I'll just talk to her. If that goes bad I have other options then.", "Because 1) the bathroom is a private place where no one should be talking to you and 2) she yelled at me in public in front of people while I was pissing. That's why I was embarrassed.", "She screams in front of customers all the time. It's frankley embarrassing for the museum.", "Ah no, she went into the women's room. That wasn't an issue.", "ESH I get being uncomfortable but this isn't the same as if she had unlocked a stand alone bathroom. It's a public bathroom and other people use it at the same time.", "NTA her behaviour was bizarre and inappropriate.", "Unless it was a emergency like a car was being towed and she was trying to be nice and help you then NTA. That was violating and not ok of her.", "This is something you should talk to her about first. Say in a calm non-judgemental voice \"hey boss, what was up with following me into the bathroom? You really made me uncomfortable. Unless there's a real emergency, I'd appreciate it if you'd allow me privacy in the bathroom.\" Maybe she'll appologize, maybe it was a real emergency, maybe it will never happen again.\n\nIt's not a good idea to run to HR the first time a little thing happens. Document the instance and if becomes a reoccuring thing, then you go to HR with the evidence. \"On 5/4, 5/8, 5/9, and 5/12, YY interrupted me while I was using the toilet even though each time I asked her not to do so in the future. Will you please help me resolve this issue.\"\n\nOf course, if it was something big (boss hit me, boss said I stole something, boss propositioned me, boss wanted me to lie/violate law/violate company policy) you'd report immediately.", "I get where you're coming from and if that was the case I probably would have been more sympathetic. But the car wasn't being towed. I checked in on it after the fact.", "You are in the right ...", "NTA, but don't expect HR to protect you.  HR exists to protect the company, not the employees.  **Document everything** about this incident.  If you speak to HR in person or on the phone, send a followup email summarizing what was said in the conversation.  If there is anything resembling retaliation, document it.  It will make your life easier if things go sideways.", "Deffo talk to whichever boss you like the most so they\u2019re aware of the situation"]}
