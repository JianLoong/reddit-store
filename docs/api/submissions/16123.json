But there is no moral ground that you can use here to justify it. Everyone around you will remember you for this. Everyone. \n\nThis is not a song you can pass of to ANYONE as beautiful song that you've always loved. Its not your song. It was, quite literally, written for your cousin by her fiancee and you are trying to pass it off as a song special to you - its not special to you. You just want to wear it like your dress and pretend its about you. But its not about you. Its not about you and never was. Its about your cousin.", "Oh, that sucks..... yea, the OP sucks.  She hid this important detail. That was one misleading post.", "Oh no you didn't miss it. OP deliberately left it out to get the responses she wanted. She knows that she is the asshole here.", "It\u2019s not, so OP is not fine.", "OP shared in the comments that the original song was revised and personalized for cousin by their fiance and it was the show they met at. Cousin shared the song with OP years ago and OP didnt like it before. OP is using the version written by the fiance for cousin and not the original song", "Probably to get the judgment they want:).", "> The original song lyrics were slightly revised by Emma's fiance\u2026The version I'm having for my entry is the revised version, Ben's friend is a professional singer who'll be singing it\n\nOP will be hiring a professional to sing the revised lyrics. Money cannot buy you class but it can buy you spite.", "I would pay BIG money to the DJ to play Countess Luann\u2019s \u201cMoney Can\u2019t Buy You Class\u201d for her to walk down the aisle to", "Love love hearing the Housewives singing \"money can't buy you class\" (girls trip Kyle is epic).\n\nAlso, OP YTA. I'm shocked you had asked reddit, how self involved are you?", "YTA you are using a song her fianc\u00e9 specifically revised for her. It\u2019s not like you\u2019re walking down to \u201cLover\u201d.", "Hate the word but I agree.  I'm floored at OP's AH behavior.", "Crook. Because she stole Emma's song.", "Same", "This sounds most correct to me, OP is toxic trash that glows so bright it shows on nighttime imagery from the International Space Station...\n\nYTA indeed.", "I would also point out that since op's wedding first, it'll look like the other bride copied op, which is a hell of a shitty thing to do.", "Lol you never said she couldn\u2019t us it  as well? It\u2019s her fucking song, you sound like hands down the worst person around.", "How kind of you to say she can also use the song her fianc\u00e9 revised for her! Generous of the copier to allow that to the people who came up with the original lyrics.\n\nYou\u2019re so entitled. I\u2019d chalk it up to how you were raised but it looks like your sister has a shred of decency, so I guess it\u2019s more that rich fianc\u00e9 left you with no empathy. Money doesn\u2019t buy class, you piece of trash. YTA.", "You are sooooooooo TA. This is a situation that someone actually \u201cowns\u201d a song.", "What was the point of specifying that your wedding was going to be fancy? Because it's so pointless. Whether it's in a trailer with first price apple juice or in a French chateau with millesim\u00e9 champagne, it doesn't change the fact that you're gonna walking down the aisle with a song shamelessly stolen from your sick cousin. \nYTA in every universes.", "YTA. Congrats! Out of all the bridal stories on here today, you are the biggest ah out of them all. I hope your cousin makes a toast and let's EVERYONE know how you stole her fiance's song and claimed it as your own wedding song. Get some class.", "You know you're in the wrong by now right? do the right thing and change it.", "She has to have gotten it somewhere.", " You don't have the same connection, you knew your cousin has a strong connection and yet you still pick it. Geez. You are being selfish.", "u/Excelleuryfju is a bot.", "Lmao. Yes!!!", "\u201cI\u2019d like to thank Emm\u2019a fianc\u00e9 for writing her such a beautiful song that was filled with so much meaning and love. It t really means a lot to me, us really, to use it as our wedding song. I know she\u2019s chosen not to attend today, but could everyone just give a hand to Emma and her fianc\u00e9?\u201d\n\nI am _always_ amazed at these choices. If you want to be the center of attention, why would you choose to walk down the aisle to a song that is going to make everyone \u2018Awww \u263a\ufe0f\u2019 over Emma and _her_ fianc\u00e9 while simultaneously thinking that you are the biggest AH and that your poor fianc\u00e9 is choosing a life of this?", "Damn.... in 25 years of wedding planning this is a first for me. Holy cow this is so not okay. My head just exploded. Oh. Hell. No.", "It's a grey area legally. If his version were parody then it would be likely considered fair use and he'd own the rights.\n\nWhether they're copyrighted outside of being fair use, as a derivative work, likely depends on how substantially different the lyrics are from the original song. He can still hold the rights to the work he made, they just don't supersede the original copyright holder's rights and thus, any attempt to distribute the work publicly would likely be in violation of the original copyright holder. (The original song is likely covered by entertainment/music licencing).\n\nSo Ben, as the (potential) copyright holder of his lyrics could send a cease-and-desist. But he might not have a legitimate claim and an actual lawsuit would be expensive. Which sucks since the AH OP is marrying into money.", "Emma played the song years ago for OP, after Emma\u2019s fianc\u00e9 revised it. Appears it\u2019s something that Emma and her fianc\u00e9 have shared with friends and family during their relationship. OP originally didn\u2019t like the song. \nOP is having a friend of the groom\u2019s sing the revised song created for Emma live at OP\u2019s wedding."]}
