My cousins helped me with some of the planning and Emma knows it's going to be a fancy wedding. So first thing she asked, after she set her wedding date was if I could pretty much make mine less flashy so it's not compared to hers. I told her I can't do that. She said she understood and that was the end of that chapter, and everything went on as usual.\n\nRecently she found out the song I'm planning to play for my bridal entry, and she's been asking me to change it because that's what she and her fiance want for their first dance (a revised version). Again, I said no, but Emma kept going on and asking to change it. I did snap at her and said she doesn't own songs, and she got upset.\n\nI wouldn't have posted on here but I've got my sister telling me I'm being a bit of a dick over this whole thing, she told me to post.

Don't engage these people in this nonsense anymore.  Enjoy this time to its fullest.", "Never really understood this obsession with \"uniqueness\" at weddings. Why should your cousin care if you have the same song? Does the fact that the song is special to you make it any less special for her? If it does, she needs to grow up.\n\nAsking you to make your wedding less flashy is way out of line too. Sounds like your cousin is getting serious bridezilla tendencies.

It happens all the time & it changes nothing.

Has it always been their song? Did he propose at this artist's concert? Anything like that?\n\nI feel like we are missing some context since you have both a sister and a friend telling you that you are in the wrong.", "NTA: She planned her wedding to be right after yours. She can't expect folks not to make comparisons. You do you and have a wonderful day. Hopefully she'll do the same.", "NTA.\nYou do your wedding exactly how YOU want to do it. Emma can get over herself. This is super petty.\n\nCongratulations on your upcoming wedding!", "NTA. Sometimes we go overboard with the whole \"it never hurts to ask\" thing. Because asking you to tone down.your wedding, and asking you to change your bridal song are tacky and very inappropriate requests and neither should've been made.\n\nPlus your wedding dj has probably played that same song at the last 20 weddings he's done. Nothing at all wrong with that, just the whole \"*my wedding!* no one else can do what I'm doing for my wedding!\" thing is flat out ridiculous.", "YTA. After reading your comments on how special the song is to Emma and her fianc\u00e9, (from a musical where they first met) and how he sings it to her at her hospital visits (she is very sick) and how you didn\u2019t even like it when SHE introduced you to the song, I think You can easily find another song to use at your wedding. Let her have this. This song is not special to you and seems petty that you are insisting on using it.", "YTA. Based on your post I couldn\u2019t understand why your friend would call you selfish. Based on your replies to comments, as additional information I do. Hiding information is naughty!\n\nYou have taken a song that you know has a special meaning to your cousin - you know this because you have written it in your replies. This isn\u2019t just a random song that would sound good at her wedding to your cousin, to you it is. There are many songs you could choose, there is 1 song with meaning to your cousin that she could choose.", "NTA.  But with you both choosing the same song, I suspect it is something of a tired wedding cliche.", "NTA tell her she can move her wedding date up if she's so concerned about being compared but she does not get to dictate any aspect of your wedding.", "NTA, you're right, no one owns songs, but honestly a wedding party entry song is pretty low stakes and un-memorable. I'd change it to keep the peace, but that's just me. I can see the other side of the coin that it's not that deep on her end, either, and she should just let it go. Either way, not a hill to die on on either side.", "Can't you all just get along? Enjoy each other's happiness, have fun at each others wedding day, and just be done with it. Its a song, I'm sure people have heard it before. \n\nNTA, but you all are living exhausting lives... \nBut congratulations on your upcoming wedding! :)", "I remember what song was played for the first dance at precisely one wedding I've attended, and what song the bride walked in to at zero.\n\nIf it's an unusual song and I attended both weddings close together there's a small chance that I might think \"I guess both couples like this song\". That is all.\n\nEmma needs to chill out.", "NTA and I hate to break it to you but guests at both weddings won\u2019t even notice the same song used. These are not details that guests recall. In fact, as long as your dress isn\u2019t super unique, you could probably wear the same dress and most wouldn\u2019t notice. Use the song you like and she can use it for her first dance. Like you said, no one owns a song and regardless you had made your choice and she had made hers, why do you have to change?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It should be the cousin she is calling that. \n\nWhy should you change anything for a wedding that has been planned just because your cousin decided to have hers a few weeks later? \n\nIt's not your fault. Your cousin should change her date if she wants these things, it's not your responsibility to cater to her when your wedding is first, she's a dick for even making her wedding a few weeks after yours and demanding you do these things so hers can look better than yours.", "NTA.

She doesn't own the song but it is THEIR song and you honestly have not sentimental attachment to said. You can pick another song OP. \n\nNormally I'd say do it because no one is gonna compare or care, but on this i think you can survive letting her have this.", "NTA   \n\n\nDang.   \n\n\nI entered the church to the Bridal March. I should have gone round all the other brides getting married that year to forbid them from using it.", "YTA and a massive one! I just saw your comments and you said that Emma had shared with you about how this song is what her fianc\u00e9/bf sang to her during her treatments and how she is sick and hence a rushed wedding. You admitted to not even liking the song  and then cut to now you want it. \nOf course she is sad and wants you to pick something else since clearly it had no sentimental value to you. \n\nHer request for you to make your wedding less flashy is out of line but considering how you had framed the post and then your comments; you are looking very sus and conniving.", "When you say \"bridal entry\", do you mean when you process down the aisle to meet your fiancee and continue with the wedding ceremony? Is this a church wedding or is it in a secular (non-religious space)? I ask because many churches have rules about what music can be used during the ceremony and you have to meet with the organist on staff for approval and planning.", "My best friend (& MOH) got married exactly 1 year after I did. Used the same venue, same menu, same DJ, photographer & first dance song... Like she said \u201cI liked your wedding plan, do you care if I use all your ideas... Nope! Have at it! Good cause I am not going to waste my time to recreate the wheel\u201d\n\neta \u2014 Every wedding is basically the same & totally different.", "Emma's reasoning is that she didn't realize I was planning to use it for my wedding, because when I first heard it from her I didn't love it. But, that was a while ago, and when we were doing all the wedding planning I thought this song would be really nice and perfect for our wedding.", "I had to double check with my Mom the other day what our first dance was to because my husband and I couldn\u2019t remember. I remember feeling beautiful and loved my day. It yeah, some details fade after time. And it\u2019s ok", "The song is from a musical, her and her fiance met when they went to watch the same show. He sang it to her on their first date and apparently does so during her appointments. I do know Emma really likes this song and I thought it would be really beautiful for my wedding. She can use it for her wedding too, I don't care, but I don't think I should have to change mine", "Replies to comments would suggest the song has sentimental meaning to the cousin and her fianc\u00e9 whereas OP just thinks it\u2019s a nice wedding song. There are many nice wedding songs OP could use, there are many less songs cousin is attached to, I would guess. So, yes, cousin could just be more entitled.", "This is an absolutely terrible take. You don\u2019t negotiate with terrorists or toddlers (and people who are acting like either). If you give into her on this, it\u2019s going to embolden her to ask for more.\n\nHonestly, nobody but the married couple is going to remember or give more than a wet fart about the choice of songs for either the entry or the first dance a week after the wedding. I\u2019ve been a groomsman or officiant at a bunch of weddings, and the only wedding where I remember what the bride entered to was when she picked the Star Wars imperial march for her song (as a joke\u2026they then switched to Pachelbel\u2019s Canon or one of the many other similar sounding classical bridal marches.", "Why should OP change it? OP had planned to use it first.", "Because the song was what the fianc\u00e9 sang to the cousin during her hospital visits and the cousin had told OP before her wedding about it!! \nAlso, the cousin is sick and hence the rushed marriage. OP left a lot of details out of post!", "In a Crowd of Thousands from Anastasia (the musical, not the movie). I didn't like it that much when I first heard it from Emma, but I've grown to really like it.", "Similar for me. We had the ceremony and a midday brunch at a very nice restaurant, very low-key, got lots of compliments. Couple of years later two friends at the wedding did the same thing, with a couple of minor changes. I was flattered!", "I had 2 cousins, both brothers, as well as 2 other cousins, a brother and sister, all on my dad's side of the family use the exact same wedding venue and caterers and serve pretty much the same food. The only difference was the desserts and drinks.\n\nFor most people, weddings are a time to meet up with family, and nobody really cares about all the other stuff except the bride. Even most grooms just go along for the ride", "Wait a minute. Did she show you this song while telling you that she was considering using it for her wedding?", "After 25 years in the planning business I could count on 1 hand how many times I have actually been surprised at the choice of a wedding song. Not surprisingly people tend to choose the same songs. I had Shania Twain (From This Moment) stuck in my head for about 3 years. I still change the channel if I hear it now.", "What appointments?", "Still doesn't apply because cousin has zero right to tell anyone else they can't use a song.", "I don\u2019t believe OP said she chose it first, only that she chose it before she knew her cousin was also planning to use it.", "[deleted]", "Absolutely! \n\nSongs are probably the least original part of every wedding. It\u2019s not strange for people to love the same song. If everyone played the exact same song at every wedding, it would not be the same song for every couple & it certainly would not change the way they will feel about dancing to \u201ctheir\u201d song.", "No, she showed it to me years ago", "Doctors/hospital visits. Emma's gotten kind of sick over the past year so her and her fiance decided to get married quickly, with only a couple months notice", "Wtf of course it applies. The context is what determines whether or not your an asshole.", "Given that OP has been planning her wedding for longer, it's a fair assumption she had it picked first. And regardless, what is your point? She vocalized that she was using it first.", "Ah, so you think that people have to be utter doomats and placate bullies to not be assholes? Nah.", "But it was in the context of telling you about her sentimental connection to the song right? \n\nI saw the other comments and I\u2019m going with YTA. Just go find a different song. Her request isn\u2019t unreasonable and would bring her much greater happiness than using the song would bring you.", "So you have no attachment to this song, but your cousin has a significant connection to it? YTA. Pick something else. He sings her this song during treatment. This song has history with them. You just think it\u2019s kinda nice. You are such an AH", "Nobody owns exclusive rights to wedding use of a song. That's just not something anybody has a right to request of anyone.", "She's a big theater fan so she often showed me songs from musicals she liked.
