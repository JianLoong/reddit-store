I was generally the only one selling toys.\n\nSo, at one show a woman \u2019recruited\u2019 me for a Christmas fair they were starting at a private elementary school in a better part of dfw.  On the set up day, I had my booth moved a couple of times to give the more \u2018serious\u2019 sellers (ie: those with more expensive products/wealthier-looking) better spots.  (I dressed in jeans, polo and comfy sneakers, not fancy).  I didn\u2019t care, I knew exactly how it was going to go.\n\nShow day, it was set up for the KIDS to shop all day.  Their parents put cash in an envelope for the kids to buy things, and each grade was staggered to spread them out over the day.  (I don\u2019t know who came up with this insane plan, most of the kids were young enough they had no idea how money worked - they just handed me their envelope and hoped there was enough.). Anyway, guess which booth kids 5-12 years old wanted to shop at, lol?\n\nMy most popular product everywhere was string puppets.  They were cute, inexpensive ($6.99) and kids loved them.  After the first 2 groups came through, word spread and I had a line at my booth every half hour and went through $1k+ of JUST puppets by mid-afternoon.  Everything sold, but the kids were playing with puppets in the hallways.  Many of the other vendors just watched.\n\nSO, this long-ass story to say one of the other vendors (most were well dressed \u2019upper crust\u2019 ladies and this one was down right snooty) came over during a lull and TOLD ME (not asked) that at the end of the show, she was taking ALL my remaining puppet stock and would only pay wholesale for them.  And to have them boxed up so as to not make her wait.  Then marched away with her nose in the air.

I could see her seething as the day wound down and classes ended.  Parents came, had 2 hours to shop and now my line was twice as long with parents and kids who had run out of money.\n\nPostscript:  The following year the board running the show learned from their inaugural year, and put my booth directly across from the entrance.  The hot, hard-to-get toy that year was Webkinz, and I had saved cases of them for that show - I was mobbed for 2 days.  I hoped that woman was there and seethed herself into apoplexy, lol.\n\nOh, and one of the organizers told me that SO many kids had puppets, they did a big layout in that years yearbook of herds of kids walking their puppets down the hallways.
