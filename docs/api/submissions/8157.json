A couple of times I\u2019ve offered to clean other peoples houses, free of charge, just to help them. Among of them,a widow who recently lost her husband of 50 years. A neighbor who had a baby and has a 3 years old daughter. Another neighbor who had a car accident. I go to their houses and I clea for them once or twice a week.\n A few days ago I was sitting on my couch when I heard someone knocking on my door. It was odd because we have a doorbell. I opened the door and this lady, around 40 years old, whom I\u2019ve seen just a couple of times said: \u201cit took you a while to open the door\u201d. I looked at her like I didn\u2019t understand what she just said and I only mumbled huh?. She then asked me in the most entitled tone, \u201cI want to know when are you going to clean my house for free\u201d, at this point I was trying not laugh and I just asked her, why would I do that? She then proceeded to mention all the houses in the neighborhood I\u2019ve cleaned and she wanted to know why I haven\u2019t been to her house yet. She then yelled at me, yes, yelled loud enough to make my next door neighbor to come outside to see what was going on, she was yelling at me because I wasn\u2019t replying to her. I was still trying to process how on earth this woman thought she had the right to come to my house and demand that I clean her house, for free. I just said,\nI am never going to clean your house. I am not the neighborhood\u2019s maid, I\u2019ve only helped a few people. She then demanded that I help her, at this point I had enough so I just said \u201cf*** off and I closed the door.\nLater that day when my husband got home, she ran to him and told him I am rude person and how I yelled at her. When I explained him what happened he told me I shouldn\u2019t have talked to her like that and next time I should be nicer.

Maybe you should tell your husband to F off too, and while you\u2019re at it stop cleaning houses for free. You are not the help.

Your husband is wrong. NTA.", "NTA. She didn't deserve any nice, that entitled ridiculous woman. Good for you for standing your ground. And I don't get your husband siding with her.", "NTA - but your husband is for not defending you.", "NTA\n\nYou tried talking to her  calmly.  That didn't work.  You then  handled her the only way she understands.  Yelling.  It sucks, but that's the only language some people speak.", "'Fuck off' was specifically invented for this exact kind of situation. \n\nWhat else is there to say?", "NTA but to those telling you to stop cleaning for free can also mind their own business.

That word of your free services has gone around and it\u2019s unfortunately turned you into the neighborhood help. \n\nAs for your husband, it\u2019s quite concerning that he felt the need to protect the crazy lady from you instead of you from her. Is it common for him to side with others over you? Is he just greatly opposed to curse words?

You being nice and helping those in need does not mean you'll do so for everyone, nor that you *have* to. Your husband's response is a bit concerning, that he doesn't have your back completely - it might be something to keep in mind and address more if it continues. Back to the lady - ignore her, do not interact with her. But if she persists, make sure to document everything in case it escalates. **NTA**", "NTA your nicer than I'd have been.", "NTA. You tried to be polite. It didn\u2019t work. You\u2019ve been very kind to help neighbors who were in difficult situations (medical or similar). No one has a right to your time. Telling her to f-off was completely reasonable. I can think of a few subreddits where this post would be enjoyed.", "NTA.  If she shows up again, just make sure that you are smiling when you tell her to eff off.  Bonus points if you use a sickeningly sweet voice.", "NTA and WTF is your husband thinking? He may have heard a lopsided story from her but he needs to get on side with you", "NTA. You were still nicer than i wouldve been \ud83d\ude02.

I'll be there February 29th, around 8am sound good? Definitely NTA.", "Absolutely NTA. You sound like a lovely person for helping out your neighbours and it\u2019s sad others feel they can take advantage of your kindness.", "NTA\n\nStop cleaning for free.

But, try to remember that when you yell at someone - even if they are yelling first - you lower yourself to their level. If someone knocked on my door and yelled at me, I would simply tell them to leave or I will call the police. Then shut the door and call. Lastly, I wonder if you husband is projecting - he probably knows what it's like to be on the receiving end of your temper! /jk  (We all yell at our loved ones the most, lol.)", "sure...why not.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
