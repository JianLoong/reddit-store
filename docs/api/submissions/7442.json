They\u2019re usually really good about customer service and getting someone out of a unit and into a different one if the host has lied or not resolved service issues like roaches and fridge not working.", "NTA.   The host did not do anything to upkeep his unit and support his guests and AirBnB sure would not either so based on that it is better to not have it in the complex where future more serious issues would surely arise.  As someone with an AirBnB house a few doors down, I know why such things are put in leases...  I live far enough away to not be directly impacted, but there are regularly police on noise complaints etc.  I was told by a next door neighbor to the house that is is a AirBnB  rental so I looked it up on their page.  I cannot imagine living directly next to it after seeing so many parties there or how there can be so many complaints and police visits with no changes.  I know AirBnB is cracking down on parties, but it sure seems to still be lots of them there, so I would not count on them to resolve anything as they seem to do as little as they possibly can.", "NTA", "Ask for your place to be fumigated.", "Well done.

AirBnN is a huge factor contributing to current housing crisis. \n\nWill your friend be ok once she's kicked out of the illegal airbnb?", "When breaking the rules, stick to just one at a time...\n\nIf you are operating an Airbnb where you are not allowed to, you need to follow all of the other rules and make sure you are not giving anyone cause to complain and expose you.\n\nIf you are going to be ignoring your duty to maintain and service the apartment, don't do it where someone asking around and trying to get help will expose you.\n\nBut realistically, don't do either, because you would be an asshole for both...\n\nAs for the op, NTA - you were getting drawn into problems because of their poor decisions, you stopped those from being an issue in the future. They screwed about and got caught.", ">I would be afraid of this too--roaches don't stay in one apartment, they travel."]}
