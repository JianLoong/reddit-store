Having them in the same bed as you is pretty extreme and, in my opinion, distasteful, but the people in these comments who are bringing up CPS are crazed. \n\nAt a guess, I wouldn't be surprised if your (former?) friend and her partner, with one kid born so soon after the first, just have never gotten to the point where they haven't felt the need to share their bedroom with the kids because at least one of them has always needed to be in sight for them to feel comfortable. It could very well be that she has simply not acclimated herself to the idea of at least her older child sleeping in their own room.  \n\nI feel that she may have responded so strongly because she inwardly knows that her behavior isn't normal and she is trying to compensate for her embarrassment by taking it out on you. That doesn't mean that you deserved any of he shittiness, though, because you didn't. \n\nI think you would have best served your own interests by not coming across as judging, especially since it's true that you haven't been in her situation (as of yet, I hope you find a solution to your fertility issues), but her reaction is completely inappropriate and makes her the asshole.", "You should really should think about reporting this.

Chances are she's already lied to your friend group about why you weren't there/that you did something to not be invited. I'd talk to one of the others - ask what the AH friend said about why you weren't there and then explain what happened - that she disclosed this behavior and you told her it was gross/made you uncomfortable.  Let her know you just want to clear the air/let them know what's going on.
