I have never dated or been interested in dating. I knew around the age of 13 that I was not developing crushes or even urges in the same way that my peers were. When I voiced this to my parents, they got me in with a therapist who specializes in queer people's mental health. Because of this, I am very confident in my sexuality and I do not feel the need to change myself to \"fit in\". I have close friendships that I value, and up until last night, I had a great relationship with my brother (30M) and his wife (32F).\n\nLast night I was over at my parent's for dinner and my brother and his wife were there with my niece, Lily (10F). My niece loves me and I love her, we always end up sneaking away from the adults to play dolls together. This is my only real time with kids as I will never have any of my own, and I value it greatly. Lily and I were playing a board game while the other adults were talking politics in the dining room, and she asked me why I don't have a husband.\n\nI told her I don't date because I am happy just having close friends. She was curious about this as it's obviously different from anyone she knows in life currently. She kept asking questions like had I ever dated before, why don't I like men, stuff like that. The conversation was very innocent, I would never cross a boundary about talking about anything explicit, and I just explained that I had never been interested in dating and liked living alone.\n\nAfter we all went home for the night, I thought little more of the conversation. This morning I woke up to angry texts from both my brother and his wife about how I was trying to \"corrupt\" Lily with my lifestyle. Apparently, she told her parents that she thinks that she is \"Asexual\" and doesn't want to date anyone ever.\n\nI replied that she's a 10 year old girl who shouldn't have any interest in dating at this age and all I did was answer her questions. They said that it was an inappropriate topic to discuss with her, and that they'll think twice before letting me spend time around her alone again. By this point, I was furious. I called them stupid and unrealistic for thinking that a 10 year old with unlimited access to the internet was too young to understand why her aunt is alone.\n\nI stopped responding after that, but they continued to send some pretty colorful texts. I stand by what I said, but my mom also chimed in that she thinks the conversation was inappropriate. My dad doesn't really care, and my close friends are on my side.\n\nSo, AITA?\n\nEdit for info so this doesn't get lost in comments: She asked if I was \"gay\" or a \"lesbian\". I figured if she understood these terms, she could understand the term that means neither. I told her that I was asexual, and it just means that I don't date anyone. That was the end of the conversation, and there was no talk of sex AT ALL.

Also, you were surrounded by family and friends who were NOT Asexual your whole life and none of them have been able \u201ccorrupt\u201d you \ud83d\ude02\ud83e\udd23 So they are idiots for thinking one conversation would corrupt anyone.

She felt safe asking you but not her parents, which says a lot. \n\nShe\u2019s 10 and things change so I don\u2019t know why her folks are so upset - except for the fact that your niece trusts you more than them.\n\nEdit: one of my kids is ace and his dad is really worried he\u2019ll never experience the pleasures of sex. I don\u2019t know why it matters as long as my son is happy with his life.

I\u2019ve worked with early childhood education and if kids are old to enough to ask a question they are old enough to get an age appropriate answer. It sounds like you did this. I usually give broad answers that might include something like: \u201cwhile I\u2019m comfortable alone many other folks like mommy and daddy are more comfortable as a team.\u201d Give them a few examples of options. Her parents are just upset bc at 10 years old kids will latch on to things and claim them but she\u2019ll grow out of it and be who she\u2019s actually supposed to be.

Especially about things that aren\u2019t \u201cnormal\u201d to them or that they haven\u2019t seen or experienced. Your niece has only probably mostly only had much experience with one primary form of sexuality and relationship \u2014 mommy and daddy.\n\nSo it\u2019s entirely natural for her to be curious about a situation that doesn\u2019t conform to that. It\u2019s also natural that she would try on the label for herself \u2014 maybe she is asexual, or maybe she\u2019ll discover later that she\u2019s not.\n\n*either way*, she is now more informed and will be more empathetic to more types of ways that humans can live and express themselves.\n\nYou\u2019re NTA for explaining asexuality to her.", "NTA.

What were you SUPPOSED to say when she asked? Lie and say, \"I haven't met the right person yet\" or \"No one has asked me\" or some other nonsense? She's probably too young to know either way, and if she's NOT ace and ends up interested in sex when she's the appropriate age for it, she'll probably have forgotten she thought she was or realize it was a thing for her ten-year-old self...unless her parents make a big thing of it.", "NTA.

You handled the questions in an age-appropriate way.", "NTA. If anybody says otherwise, I wouldn\u2019t worry too much about them. There are a lot of \u2018phobes of LGBTQIA+ folks on Reddit.

It doesn't matter if someone is straight, gay, lesbian, bisexual, asexual - as long as they're safe and happy.\"\n\nAny reasonable adult faced with questions about that, or their niece saying that she's never fallen in love before and might be asexual would then say something like, \"You're very young and even adults haven't fallen in love before and then find someone.

It's just like all the kids in HS trying to be unique by dying their hair blue and next thing you know, not only is everyone copying their blue hair (making them no longer unique at all) but now it's the pink haired kid that is getting all the attention; so I better dye my hair pink!", "[removed]", "NTA, but I wonder if there's something getting lost in translation?

That said, your comment about how 10 year olds shouldn\u2019t be interested in dating indicates that you also have a poor understanding of sexual development in children.

Would you have been okay if she said Ace instead of a sexual?", "[deleted]", "Oh, I don't know if it was either. As I said, it depends on the very subtle details, and someone would sort of have to be there. I'm just saying there's a middle ground between \"answer everything right away\" and \"send her to Urban dictionary.\"\n\nI'm not saying one should never countermand a parent's message. It's just that OP should try to educate the parents first before the daughter.", "I help them out, if they got a question I answer it but I\u2019m also respectful not to talk to them about issues a parent should be talking to them about. It\u2019s not my place.", "No idea. I\u2019m tapping out.", "The 10 year old in question already understands that adults have dating preferences, because they asked OP if they had a husband, and asked if OP was straight or a lesbian.", "You don't think it's appropriate for the child to know that her parents are married? That's a dating preference, too.", "But then why is telling them they have a husband any different? That\u2019s stating dating preferences.", "But why should she have thought this was a sensitive topic? It wouldn\u2019t be if the niece was asking her cis het cousin instead. Everyone here even folks who I\u2019m sure are amazing allies are forgetting that being ACE is as normal as being heterosexual. If kids can learn all about heterosexual normative relationships even when they are 2, why would 10 be too young for this topic?", "There was nothing inappropriate about that conversation, if the niece is asking those questions then she most likely already knows a lot more than the parents think she does. If the parents wanted to handle every conversation about sexuality, etc. they shouldn\u2019t of let her have unlimited internet access as that clearly played a part in her asking OP those questions."]}
