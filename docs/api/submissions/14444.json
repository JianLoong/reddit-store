I brought two friends (21m and 22f) of mine because they wanted to see what it's like. Also attending were my sister (29f), her boyfriend my brother (26m) and my parents (52m and 47f).\n\nI've already told my friends stories about how my mom would act when I did something that was disappointing in her eyes, how she always threatened to disown me, or that I was barely allowed to make any decisions at all in my life. I know that she loves me but she's done many things the wrong way and hurt me pretty badly in the process. Of course she doesn't want to hear any of that. It doesn't matter that she once told me I was the biggest regret of her life, or the biggest shame of the family (I was called that because I finished 10th grade with a grade point average of 2.2, which is not bad at all!). In her opinion all of that is totally fine because she loves me and only wants the best for me.\n\nObviously I didn't want any drama while my friends where over, plus I hate arguing with my mom since she has a tendency to say very hurtful stuff. But frustration and a bit too much wine got the better of me. You see, since the moment my friends arrived all my mom could say about me where my flaws and the things I do wrong. Not one word of pride has come out of her mouth and even my friends noticed. It was almost as if she tried to drag me into the worst light possible in front my friends and I was at a point where I almost broke down crying. When I meet my friend's parents they always say nice stuff, sure a funny hib here and there is normal but that was just devastating. Even my friends noticed it!\n\nSo I started telling stories about how she made me cry when I was a child and she had to teach me spelling. I'm severely dyslexic and was simply not capable of spelling certain things right, so she kept pushing and pushing until I cried. I also told the story of how I had to perform a song and she had helped teach me by literary breaking my spirit until I could sing the right tones. That btw a story my siblings and I share and she usually finds it funny. \n\nNow she's mad at me for telling these stories and making her look like a monster in front of others. \nAm I the asshole?", "created_utc": 1681128023, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12hgo26/aita_for_telling_stories_about_my_moms/", "score": 234, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Her being embarrassed by her own behavior speaks volumes. I\u2019m sorry you dealt with that.", "NTA. You should probably talk to a therapist if you haven\u2019t already.

I would also suggest going low contact with your mother unless you two can learn to communicate directly and not allow your mother to emotionally manipulate you. I\u2019m speaking from experience as someone with a slightly toxic mother.", "NTA tell your mom this \"If the truth about your conduct paints you in a bad light, the problem isnt with the truth its with your conduct.\"\nDont want to be seen as a monster, dont act like one simple.", "NTA. For me it sounds like she was abusive and covers it behind the typical 'but I only wanted your best' curtain. I'd go LC with her.", "NTA. She's bothered about how she looks, not about how she treated you.", "NTA. \n\nIt sounds like an uncomfortable night for all, but had your mother treated you with the love and respect you deserve, instead of berate you in front of friends and family, it would not have reached that point.", "NTA. She looked like a monster because she was behaving like one.", "NTA. Your mum is right, she is a monster.", "NTA but I don't think that really matters in this situation. It is obvious your mom is an asshole, but it's now up to you to set boundaries and tell her those - and that, if she oversteps them, you'll no longer visit on holidays (or in general) as they are no fun to you this way. I'm sorry you went through this.", "NTA. This is emotional abuse and you should think about going low contact if no contact.", "I'm sorry that your Seder turned into Festivus.", "NTA.   It sounds like narcissistic abuse which is very painful.     Narcissists don't like to be exposed.", "She is a monster.

At some level, your mother needs to understand that she was overbearing and over protective so you can have a loving adult relationship. You are at the age to go out and live your life and she needs to accept that. Maybe some counseling for you to consider how to address it better and make it work for yourself.", "NTA and idk where you are but a 2.2 GPA is really bad lol", "This is like some crazy revenge plot that wasn't plotted out you aren't necessarily the asshole here. I'd say talk to your parents and question what it is that makes them do this and see if you can probably talk it out and find solutions.
