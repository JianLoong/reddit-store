I brought two friends (21m and 22f) of mine because they wanted to see what it's like. Also attending were my sister (29f), her boyfriend, my brother (26m) and my parents (52m and 47f).\n\nI've already told my friends stories about how my mom would act when I did something that was disappointing in her eyes, how she always threatened to disown me, or that I was barely allowed to make any decisions at all in my life. I know that she loves me but she's done many things the wrong way and hurt me pretty badly in the process. Of course she doesn't want to hear any of that. It doesn't matter that she once told me I was the biggest regret of her life, or the biggest shame of the family (I was called that because I finished 10th grade with a grade point average of 2.2, which is not bad at all!). In her opinion all of that is totally fine because she loves me and only wants the best for me.\n\nObviously I didn't want any drama while my friends where over, plus I hate arguing with my mom since she has a tendency to say very hurtful stuff. But frustration and a bit too much wine got the better of me. You see, since the moment my friends arrived all my mom could say about me where my flaws and the things I do wrong. Not one word of pride has come out of her mouth and even my friends noticed. It was almost as if she tried to drag me into the worst light possible in front my friends and I was at a point where I almost broke down crying. When I meet my friend's parents they always say nice stuff, sure a funny hib here and there is normal but that was just devastating. Even my friends noticed it!\n\nSo I started telling stories about how she made me cry when I was a child and she had to teach me spelling. I'm severely dyslexic and was simply not capable of spelling certain things right, so she kept pushing and pushing until I cried. I also told the story of how I had to perform a song and she had helped teach me by literary breaking my spirit until I could sing the right tones. That btw a story my siblings and I share and she usually finds it funny. \n\nNow she's mad at me for telling these stories and making her look like a monster in front of others. \nAm I the asshole?\n\nEdit 1: Since some of you are wondering about my GPA, I'm from Germany.

Sweetheart thats not telling stories - that's trauma dumping (not in a conscious negative way). Your mother was clearly emotionally abusive, and from what I can tell still is. I understand why you shared your experiences with your friends if they are your safe space.

Sometimes it can become overwhelming for both you and your friends when they hear your pain yet are unable to help, because they lack the resources to.

You will be better off cutting her off when you can. I will explain why. All the put downs and verbal abuse make scars on your soul, your mind, your emotional well being. They are wounds that weep and stay open until contact is broken and then they start to heal up and scar over. Also, no matter that you think you do not take her remarks seriously and brushing them off, they do take a toll on your self confidence and self worth and that will effect your jobs and relationships. But the main reason for cutting her off is the fact that your whole life is made up of memories. Your mother's presence, your mother's words will dominate your memories over everything else. The longer she is in your life the more and more of your life and memories she will have a dark shadow, dark presence over.

I just want you to be the best you can be\u201d", "NTA\n\nIf she thinks the things she did were okay, why would she be embarrassed?  The only reason she's upset is because she knows that what she did was abusive, she just knows that she can normally browbeat you into dropping it by holding your relationship with her hostage.  If you try to push back, she pulls out the \"ungrateful child\" narrative.  That you are misunderstanding her \"love\" and should feel bad for doing so. \n\nWhat you have just had revealed to you is that she is aware she was wrong, she just doesn't have the emotional sway needed to manipulate your friends the way she has over you and so she couldn't flip the script.  You were right.  This isn't how loving parents act.  This isn't 'tough love'.  She was and is abusive to you and she knows it.  She enjoys the power she feels when she steps on you.\n\nNow that you know this and know that this isn't just her not understanding what she did wrong, the ball is in your court.   She is never going to change if you always let her set the terms of your relationship and never be accountable.  If you continue to be a part of her life while she habitually tears you down, she will never have any reason to stop.  It's time to cut her off and try to focus on repairing the harm she did to you without her inference or narratives.  Stop the habit of trying to win approval that's never going to come and start learning how to approve of and love yourself.  The help of a therapist would be a great step in that direction.  Doing that will help you set boundaries and not accept abuse from her or others in your life.", "NTA. My mother used to do the same thing to me.

My mother has also since passed, and through a number of personal experiences have come to understand her on a greater level and acknowledge the many obstacles she had, including the dynamic she had with my father, who frequently undermined her and said things to me to further color my perception of our relationship.

Guilt that I cannot absolve because my mother is dead. \n\nSo my question, without judgment, is what exactly are you hoping to achieve out of this situation? Are you hoping to effect your mother in some way, or are you hoping to have your own experiences seen and validated by those around you?\n\nI don\u2019t really feel comfortable saying Y or N because I\u2019ve personally been there and honestly it\u2019s a little of both. Either way, since I\u2019ve been there I do actually have actionable advice: you need some space and some therapy. You need space from your mother because the relationship has become a cycle of toxicity. Even in this post you\u2019re bouncing all over the place from traumatic memory to traumatic memory. It takes a lot of time and effort to process through so much mess.

This is the primary relationship with another human at birth and infants literally have to have a connection with their mother to survive (not disrespecting single dads, adoptive parents or other folks raising kids without the biological mom in any way to be clear). Just pointing out that it is SO difficult to put aside internalized feelings of inadequacy even as you grow old enough to realize you were not responsible for your mother's treatment of you. I think the difference between seeing this as the reality with your mother and feeling free from the need to keep trying to explain away, negotiate or blame yourself for how you felt and feel in regards to the relationship is the work of a lifetime. Going low contact and no contact are good and healthy choices but please don't beat yourself up further if you backslide. It isn't a sign your mother was right, just the inclination of any loving child to keep forgiving in an attempt to get a different outcome. No one who cares about you would attempt to humiliate you in the way you describe. When you only describe the facts of a situation to others and the person you described says you made them look like a monster what is happening is that they are in fact behaving like a monster. If they don't enjoy looking like a monster they need to change their actions. But she isn't going to change. I'm sorry.
