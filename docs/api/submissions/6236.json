This is not the case with OP and her boyfriend.  If he really wanted her to ask permission, and base her actions on what he says ... no way.", "I wonder if by \"permission\" bf meant that OP should've mentioned it to him? And that he'd do what for her? Because perhaps he thought they'd spend labor day together? I hope so, because if he really meant \"permission\" then I 100% agree with everyone here - ditch the loser. NTA", "Exactly right. I've been married almost 30 years, and because That Man I Married (affectionate nickname) and I have co-mingled finances and a kid, we discuss plans if we're going to be gone somewhere overnight, but it's not a permission thing. OP's boyfriend is way outta line.\n\nNow, if OP's boyfriend was going to be in town on Labor Day, I could see where they should have a discussion, considering this is a long-distance relationship and boyfriend would be coming for a visit, but again, not permission. That's ridiculous.\n\nNTA", ">If he's your partner it's totally reasonable for him to expect you would discuss the plans before you make them final. \n\nIf they're living together, or in a routine of meeting every weekend, then sure. But as a long distance partner, there's not even a discussion, he can be happy with just being informed of what she's up to.", "And she did discuss to coordinate. By the sounds of things, almost immediately.", "Wow that took an interesting turn.", "I mean\u2026 you don\u2019t _neeeed_ permission for that but it\u2019s recommended\u2026", "have you even met this guy? What country is he from, where are you from?", "Thank you this is what I was looking for. Girl enjoy Casa Bonita and get all the sopaipillas your heart desires!! I fucking love South Park and would kill to visit someday", "I\u2019m not sure you can just go around doing sexual acts to people without consent", "Casa Bonita!?!\ud83d\ude06", "Coloradooo", ">I vaguely remember being 17, and 19 year olds who hung out with us were definitely suspect.  That age gap is not horrific, but it is not normal.\n\nHere in Italy students usually are 19 by the time they finish high school. I skipped a year and was 17 entering my last year in high school.\n\nSome of my class mates were 19 before I was 18.", "Re Opens in April?"]}
