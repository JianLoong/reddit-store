He is trying to make you believe that since you\u2019re young, you don\u2019t understand how relationships are supposed to work.\n\nYou know better. But he will do his very best to convince you that he knows better.\n\nIf you believe him on this one, this will only be the beginning of the things he will try to \u201cteach\u201d you about how to \u201crespect\u201d him as a partner (aka how to be exactly what he wants) You will likely notice that somehow none of the things you need to do to \u201crespect\u201d him are things he will do for you. He won\u2019t ask permission from you to go out with his friends.\n\nHim being angry is such a hassle that you might (without really noticing) start avoiding planning things like this in the future because it won\u2019t seem worth making him mad. \n\nWhich would annoy your friends, and it is likely that you will be invited less and less to make plans with them.

Remember to put your flight times down on the calendar if you want me to pick you up/drop you off.\"", "You are exactly right, you don't need permission.", "NTA. But get the f out of that relationship. Have you even met him in person?  He's gonna start asking you to send him money. Especially if he doesn't have money to come to you. Sounds sketchy to me", "NTA. Running it passed him is respect. Asking for permission is control. He needs to learn the difference. Especially in another country.", "NTA run girl, run. As an adult, you don't need to ask permission to do something personal or recreational. Sure, there are work situations where you have to ask and if you're staying at another person's house it can be good manners to ask permission for something, but this is not in that realm. In a relationship where you share a budget or children, or live together, it can be important to discuss financial decisions and time away for care/meal arrangements etc BUT that isn't asking permission, more a negotiation of how something can fit in with other commitments.", "Crazy that your truths upset him. Someone wants to be in control of things he shouldn't control. Dump him.", "Major red flag, run.\nI\u2019ve been 20 yrs now with my husband and I never asked \u00ab\u00a0permission\u00a0\u00bb to go out or to travel if it doesn\u2019t involve him. Of course we\u2019re married with kids so for planning purpose we talk about that stuff but never to seek permission from each other. \nHe is showing controlling behaviour and you should stay away from that type of person.", "Girl, get gone.", "NTA. He is your boyfriend, an equal partner in this relationship with you. Unless he starts asking your permission to do things (very unlikely!), you do not need his permission to do things. Simple.\n\nIf he does not know how to be a partner, you need a better boyfriend.", "Even if you're married you still don't need to ask for permission and same with them with you. You are two individuals and just because they come into your life doesn't mean they magically have some sort of authority over what you do with yourself. As long as you aren't doing something to betray them like cheating or whatever else you've agreed on as far as being committed, you can do what you want. It's not a healthy relationship for your partner to have to give you permission to do something.", "Wait, does he ask your permission if he wants to do anything? I know you're dating long distance but I'm wondering what century he's actually living in. NTA", "NTA run hun. Get out of that relationship and don't look back. Sounds like he's trying to isolate you, and that is a massive red flag.", "NTA.", "He thinks your a dog", "NTA because no, you do not need to ask you BF for \u201cpermission\u201d to do social things with your friends.\n\nHowever, as someone who was once in a long-distance relationship, I do know that this requires a lot of planning and compromise, especially when you are dealing with people who may have jobs that offer limited vacation days. Is it possible that this is what he meant - that he wished you had discussed the plans with him before committing, because you taking a trip with someone else that uses your vacation time (and money) may turn out meaning that the two of you are unable to see each other when you wanted to. If he used the language as presented then I still go NTA, but having been in this situation, you do have to go out if your way to take the other person into account with any plans, more so than you would have to if you lived in the same city.", "NTA. In twelve years the only time I\u2019ve asked my husband for permission to do something was when I wanted to visit a friend across country, and that was only because we share finances and agreed we both have to okay purchases over a certain amount. Which is really less asking to go and more \u201cCan we afford this right now?\u201d He was never gonna say no. At most I would have gotten \u201cI think we need a little more in reserve before you do that because -insert good reasons here-\u201c He said go ahead, which sadly I never ended up doing because I was supposed to go mid-March 2020. Someday\u2026", "NTA- You don't live together and he isn't paying. This is super controlling behavior, especially since it's still relatively early in the relationship.", "This is not a AITA topic...  just...  RRRUUUNNNNN. Run right now. Dont stop. Get away from him.", "Yeah, his expectations are unreasonable. You\u2019re not his property nor his subject. This is definitely a blue flag.", "Fucking run.", "You are long distance dating you are not even married to him and he expects you to get his \"permission\" ? \n\nGurl, run don't walk, as fast as you can away from him. \n\nHe's not a keeper.", "If any man told me, an adult, I needed his permission to go on a road trip with a friend, he'd be a tiny spot in my rear view mirror. Assuming, of course, he survived the Julia Sugarbaker With F Bombs dressing-down I'd have given him. \n\nNTA and dump this guy. You are not his possession.", "NTA. \n\nYou're an adult.  You don't need anybody's permission to go on a trip.  And telling him so wasn't stupid.  Yeah it made him upset but sometimes you have to upset people in order to assert yourself and your rights.  Sometimes conflict is necessary, and it's good to learn how to handle conflict so that people don't walk all over you.  Like... if someone kicks my shin and I say \"don't do that\" and that upsets them... good!  Even if I love someone I don't have to placate them or soothe them if they did something shitty.  They're not gonna die from feeling upset.\n\nYour boyfriend showed some major red flags here.  Him ignoring you because you did something he didn't like and making you ask him \"what's wrong\" is manipulative.  Him thinking that he has a right to control you and that you have to ask his \"permission\" in order to do something is fucking disturbing.\n\nBasic respect for your partner is letting them know what your plans are so they don't worry about you.  It's talking things out and maybe compromising if your plans affect theirs in some significant way.  It isn't treating your partner as an authority over you.  You're equals.", "Run! Run far far away from that person! Giant red flag!", "NTA. Potential dumpable offence - he needs to chill out.", "YTA. You\u2019re 18. Why would you have a long distance bf??", "INFO\nIs there a chance he may have been planning to visit you as a surprise for your birthday and was thrown off by your sudden plans?", "NTA.

That\u2019s a major red flag. You don\u2019t need his permission to do anything.", "NTA this seems like it's going to lead to abuse. Who is he to tell you what to do or not? And why is someone who was 19 dating to someone underage?", "NTA. This is standard break-up material", "NTA. \n\nAnd keep this a long distance relationship permanently. As in, don't get any more attached or involved than you already are at this time. You are not chattel, and you don't need to ask permission to live your life for yourself. \n\nEven if he gave his permission, he would only use it as emotional leverage against you in the future. Cut this cancer from your life before it metastasis and spreads throughout your life in other unwelcome ways.", "NTA and need to RUN from that red flag!", "NTA!! Run!!!!", "You don't need his permission. INFO: is it possible that he was already planning to visit you or have you visit him for your birthday?", "NTA and yes, running is a good idea. That mindset is not ok and a giant red flag. Even if you did live together PERMISSION is not part of the equation.", "Nta. He\u2019s a lot more than an AH. Silent treatment and permission slips, like what?! You\u2019re grown enough to make these plans, you\u2019re grown enough to carry them out. You\u2019re grown enough to not ask his permission, he\u2019s not your parent. It\u2019s not disrespectful unless you are cancelling plans with him to carry out these plans with your friend, and that\u2019s even a stretch. \nI\u2019ve been married forever, and never once asked my husbands permission for anything, we discuss things, we make sure our kids are covered if we want to go somewhere. Ask permission? Ha, no!", "Basic respect for your partner does NOT include asking for PERMISSION go somewhere, do something, or spend your own money. If your partner thinks/expects you REQUIRE their permission for something, they do not consider you a partner. They consider you a POSSESSION.\n\nYou are not a possession. Your partner does not get to control you. You capable of making decisions and choices about your life and what you do by yourself.

Get out of this relationship now.", "In case you haven't figured it out, he was planning on coming to surprise you for your birthday.", "Exactly, NTA.\n\nAnd OP, please....please consider letting him go. Once I was 18, I was hit by the travel bug and traveled to various places. I was with a controlling guy who would end up ruining most of my trips due to their drama, which happened all through text messages. They would break up with me mid-trip and then get back when I got back home... lol... \n\nI was very naive back then and I wish I didn't allow some boy to ruin potentially great memories. I have no doubt you'll feel the same in the future if you continue to allow this behavior. \n\nLive your life! Because the person who is meant for you will either live it with you or support you in living your life.", "I've never thought to ask permission from my spouse for anything.", "What permission ? Underage kids living with parents need to take their permission for doing stuff. As partners you both are equal. Does he take your permission before doing everything ? \n\n\nAlso it makes me wonder is he from a culture where it is extremely patriarchal and misogynistic the way men are raised ? I come from something similar as men are treated as Demigods in my culture. If so then I can see why he is like that but still it doesn't make it right. \n\nSo it's up to you whether you want to cater to such ridiculous demands or live your life independently.", "This. End the relationship without asking permission too! NTA", "NTA & I gazhillionth the calls to RUN. They always start with seemingly nonsensical things like this.", "We come from very different religious backgrounds and he\u2019s always had a traditionalist mindset but this is the first time it\u2019s been an issue.", "Not yet but we were planning on it for winter break this year", "This was my first thought too. I definitely think \u201cpermission\u201d is a bad word choice and use of language, but that could also be a language barrier or he was in his emotions and chose wrong.\n\nI\u2019ve been in a long distance relationship and it can take a lot of coordinating when factoring in time zones, time to talk on the phone, scheduling virtual dates, scheduling trips to see each other physically with limited time off work or other responsibilities. Then throw on any work schedules, school schedules, family events, holidays, etc., it can become a scheduling nightmare. Then you also have to balance that with what is financially possible, so it helps to hit important dates, and you sometimes sacrifice other trips and things to be able to afford traveling to see your partner. So, having been in this situation, I could see wanting to prioritize spending a birthday together. My ex planned a big party with friends and family for her birthday, but didn\u2019t invite me, and on one hand that\u2019s fair, she wasn\u2019t under any obligation to invite me, but it also hurt a little considering we were dating and I worked remotely so I could easily travel. Instead she wanted me to fly in a day or two later to celebrate. Then she changed her mind and decided she did want me at her party, so then we paid even more money for me to travel. Even though we lived hundreds of miles apart and had very different lives, we still impacted each other\u2019s lives daily and the choices we made could strengthen or weaken the relationship. Long distance really does require a lot of communication, managing expectations, planning/coordinating with time and money, and the best way for them the succeed is to always have the next trip planned and scheduled and a plan and timeline for uniting two people and lives together in one place.", "I wouldn\u2019t, I\u2019d just like to be informed about it but when we were discussing it he told me that he would have asked. I\u2019ve never seen this put into action before so I had no idea he expected that", "No, he said he felt I didn\u2019t respect him as my partner or that I valued our relationship less because we\u2019re LD and that\u2019s why I should have asked because I would have in person", "I wish but he doesn\u2019t have a passport. When we planned on meeting later this year I would be the one traveling to meet him", "Ten thousand times this ^^^^^^", "I\u2019ll maybe ask for an opinion or float an idea, but he knows I\u2019m gonna do what I wanna do in the end.\n\nAsking permission to go on a trip - weird AF.

Biggest excuse in the world for people to justify being controlling or abusive... cultural differences and religious differences. \"Traditionalist mindset\" call it what it really is... abusive and controlling. If he was truly Traditional, he wouldn't have a long distance relationship and he'd already have his passport. My friend was dating a Traditional and catholic guy. He claimed to not believe in not moving in together before marriage, conformed to gender roles, believed men should be the providers and she couldn't never tell him what to do with his money, blah blah blah. Well... he got her pregnant, blamed her, but then... \"did the right thing\" and proposed to her. He moved in with her half way through her pregnancy. Their child is now 4 years old. No wedding plans, he works on construction for his own spending money, she pays all living expenses since \"she makes more,\" she still cooks, cleans, takes care of their child. When she's at work, her mom takes care of him, even if the dad isn't working. He's slowly trying to get to where he's the stay at home dad. They're in their 40s... it'd be even worse if they were younger without any life experiences. \n\nPoint is... figure out if you're okay being controlled unjustly or not and be aware of key words in young men with no realy adult life experience like \"Traditional,\" \"religious,\" etc", "Then it's even worse.
