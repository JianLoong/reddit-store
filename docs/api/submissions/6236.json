Even if he had plans to surprise you by showing up for your birthday and was unhappy about your plans because of that (not saying he did, just reaching for the possibility of a reasonable reason for not wanting you to go), that was absolutely not the way to handle it. RUN!", "nta - red flags a waving wildly...i dont know what country he is in but in the western world a woman does not have to ask anyones permission to go on a trip!  u just saw a revelation.  now that u seen it think about moving on to someone that values your independance and spirit.", "Ok; this scenario I say go to the extreme and run. You were right you didn\u2019t need his permission; especially as he\u2019s not paying. that his reaction to your rationale was emotional attack. A good partner does what you did; inform them of your plans.", "NTA. You are 18 and only dating. This is controlling, scary behavior. Please do not stay together with this person for your own safety.", "NTA. Partnership not ownership.", "NTA. \"Permission\" LOL\n\nJust run like crazy, your bf is no good", "Would you expect him to ask if he was going on a trip?", "Red flag red flag red flag\u2026\u2026 NTA", "Omg no. This is a major red flag. He is gaslighting and manipulating you. Please end this relationship. NTA", "Totally agree NTA . Demanding to be asked permission is totally controlling ALSO giving the silent treatment is another major and manipulative red flag. Op get out while you can.", "exactly.. discussing to coordinate is fine, example \"just so you know, I will be unavailable labor day weekend.... so don't plan to do anything with me\".   vs  \"boyfriend do I have your permission...?\"  you are not his child", "NTA \n \nThat's some serious marinara.", "Big marinara flags. OP needs to drop this controlling loser.", "That\u2019s not exactly a crazy age gap\u2026 and in most countries perfectly legal too, either because they are both of age or if not because of what are known as Romeo and Juliet laws. Now everything else is a terrifying red flag but a two year age gap is not something that is uncommon.", "> right up there with a 19 year old dating a 17 year old.\n\nIt's not really that big of an age difference.\n\nHer boyfriend is a controlling ass, but let's not pretend 19 and 17 is too big of an age gap.", "South Park :)", "No, that\u2019s not the case he said. He feels like because we\u2019re long distance I don\u2019t respect him", " There's a difference between being concerned and controlled.", "It\u2019s a whole Italian restaurant\u2019s worth of marinara", "That's because he doesn't see himself as your property. There's a difference between being concerned and controlled. He's trying to control your agency.", "He's probably not going to give you permission to break up with him, but you should consider doing so anyway.", "Yeah this is true. But taking the other behavior into account it seems a bit more sus than \"normal\". *shrug* I believe OP also mentioned it was a long distance thing, so unless they had known each other before he turned 18, it feels a bit on the yucky side.", "I vaguely remember being 17, and 19 year olds who hung out with us were definitely suspect.  That age gap is not horrific, but it is not normal.  People just mature so quickly at that age, and the life experience/daily concerns of a high school student living at home are very different from a college student on their own, for example.\n\nThat said, the age difference in this post is less disturbing than the controlling manipulative behavior of the boyfriend.", "Awesome, where at", "\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9", "Okay, so first of all, long distance partners can still be controlling and abusive so don't assume just because he's not physically present, he's not TA. Second, if you do want to stay with him, I recommend meeting him on neutral territory (like, a place neither you nor he live) to sus out what he's really like when not comfortable with his hometown moorings.", "> That age gap is not horrific, but it is not normal.\n\nI think it depends on where you live. I teach HS in an area surrounded by farming towns, averaging less than 2000 people each. In these villages, everyone knows everyone and the schools are very small (one of the high schools has 142 students, total, in grades 7-12). Those juniors and seniors are friends with others or date kids two years out of school frequently. My town\u2019s population is about 17,000, so it\u2019s much less common and considered sketchy. \n\nThat being said, I\u2019d be concerned about any 16 year old having an online SO. There\u2019s just too many things that can go wrong."]}
