Did you just invite him and say \"you are welcome to come if you want\" or did you specifically say \" i want you to come with me on this trip\" ?\nAnd if you're husband isnt going you shouldnt go either, espicially that there's guys in this trip.

Of course, my ex boyfriend, who I was platonically sharing an apartment with when I met my husband, was the one encouraging me to call and date him.  He is \u201cuncle\u201d to our kids. He helped keep our 2nd kid alive, when the infant had horrible colic. My husband was never concerned with cheating, and we never would. That part of our relationship was long over.

I feel like in my 20s I might have been more paranoid about this. But now, 10 years in with a great partner and really solid friends, he could go skinny dipping alone with my hottest friend and I wouldn\u2019t be worried because we\u2019re all adults and friends and that\u2019s primarily how we relate to and think of each other.", "You\u2019ve been with someone for 10 years and you\u2019re not married. Have you considered the possibility that everybody isn\u2019t striving for that lifestyle? \n\nI mean, most in a relationship seeking the purpose of marriage, eternal commitment, etc wouldn\u2019t think this dynamic is desirable. Nor would they be ok with the thought of their partner skinny dipping with their hottest friend despite a level of trust? \n\nI\u2019m just sharing my perspective. Yours certainly isn\u2019t wrong because it\u2019s YOURS. And I respect yours, but it\u2019s not for me. Other perspectives exist and that doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re wrong.", "I\u2019m confused. What does that have to do with anything? Are you saying trust declines after marriage?", "I think the naked swimming is a tad weird, I'm all for enjoying other peoples company but not so much their genitals, unless it was a group thing? We're getting a bit \"keys in the bowl\" on that ground of thinking but yeah, I don't believe a holiday or trip is weird but I'm going to throw a counter out for my own argument...was the husband invited? We start entering rocky ground again when expensive plans like holidays start getting booked without your partner.", "No, I\u2019m not saying that. What I\u2019m saying is everybody doesn\u2019t strive for 10 years of a relationship without marriage. Some seek the eternal bond and commitment of marriage. The truth is, that can\u2019t be replicated in any other fashion than marriage. This is because the option for one of you to skate out exists with no legal recourse or ramification.\n\nThat\u2019s possibly why you aren\u2019t all that worried about your partner cheating and have a different perspective on the issue. Because if he did; you leave. There is no bond of marriage or children binding you all together. No sense of duty or obligation. Basically, you have achieved free will with the added perks of a fake marriage. \n\nOP on the other hand has made an eternal commitment to her husband. She has achieved with him what you have not with your partner. And with that comes sacrifice and a true dependency on being \u201cone\u201d.\n\nOP\u2019s HUSBAND is not comfortable with the situation, yet she is still deliberately doing something that makes him uncomfortable. This goes beyond trust. This is a violation of a commitment. \n\nThat\u2019s something that you don\u2019t understand because you don\u2019t have that with your partner. What you have is still special, I\u2019m just saying not everyone strives for it.", "NTA, your husband is going through an insecure time in his life and I get that but it would be selfish on his part to just forbid you from doing something that you also love to do just because he's going through some insecurities that he could workout with you and get through it.", "YTA - I think your husband rightly feels left out of his own marriage. He is not hurt about you going rock climbing, he is hurt that he is stuck in his over-sized body and can't do those fun things anymore. He's crying for help. \nYou need to meet half way. Just go on an easy walk and get outdoors with your husband. Go to counseling and get a person who can help you discuss how to resolve this issue. This is the ideal \"little\" thing that CAN be fixed with counseling. They HELP you discuss and work out topics like this."]}
