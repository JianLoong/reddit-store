You're freaking adults. It's her job. In my state, you could get fired for that BS. Tell him next time, he can come in. It didn't affect him because he wasn't inconvenienced. SO easy to tsk tsk someone when you haven't been affected!", "Maybe TA. It's possible she did misunderstand something and think she was told she wasn't needed. It's unfortunate that it happened but also it's not a crazy malicious thing she did. At most it was forgetfulness. If you turn it into a fight then it will blow up into a much bigger thing. I understand it happened at an upsetting time but humans are flawed and it's an easy mixup to have.\n\nYou have two choices, you either forgive the mixup and move on and keep an employee you seemed to like otherwise. Or you blow this up and harbor ill will and lose that employee", "NTA \nAlso management sucks. If no one is there to work, close early. It's fine.", "NTA. You scheduled her for a 2-hour shift after she agreed. She didn't show up. Therefore, she's a no call no show.", "NTA.  If anything, you were too soft on her.  No call, no show should mean termination.", "nta", "NTA and the write up is appropriate so long as there is no proof you actually told her that (and also assuming you didn't and forgot about it).", "NTA. Your boss never should have contacted you while you were at a funeral. Your boss should have dealt with the situation.", "Is the schedule posted somewhere for employees to see, or is it just in your head / desk? Sarah is insisting that you had told her verbally that she wasn't needed. A written schedule would avoid this problem.\n\nSoft YTA, because I'm giving Sarah the benefit of the doubt and assuming she's being honest about her understanding of the situation.", "NTA and your boss should have taken over all of this scheduling and confirming and, if need be, covering the shift while you are at your stepfather\u2019s funeral. These people are callous.", "NTA. You made a verbal agreement and then documented that agreement on the  official written schedule. If she had a different understanding it was on HER to clarify the \u201cerror\u201d in the written schedule. And the idea that people need to be reminded to show up for shifts they agreed to that are documented in the official schedule is absurd.  \n\nYour response as a manager should be the same as any other no call no show, whatever that policy is.

I had no such conversation with sarah.\n\nSo either she genuinely misunderstood what you told her, or she's lying. In either case, NTA - you don't want to be bending rules and procedures to \"be less harsh.\"\n\nBUT in the case that she genuinely was confused about the schedule, your boss does make a good point: it wouldn't have hurt to confirm the schedule on the day of, or maybe the day before. If I'm reading this correctly, there was no conversation about this for at least two weeks. In the future, make sure that no miscommunication is remotely possible.", "You\u2019re probably right. Just not worth my time to continue to be angry when she could have genuinely forgotten.", "This is a terrible boss mentality and will only ensure you never retain any actual thinking employees", "Written schedule was adjusted upon the verbal change and is always available on the desktop of the pc.", "There's genuinely forgetting or mistaken and then making something up though. If you never had any other conversation with her between the initial and the funeral then how can she say you told her she wasn't needed.", "What???  Are you claiming that Sarah is an actual thinking employee?  The one who claimed she could be counted on during a funeral, but then decided not to show?", "It would be very very very very easy to set up a shared calendar for free that you could all check from home or when out and about on the phone. A schedule at the place of work does nothing if there is confusion when they're not there.\n\nThe shared calendar doesn't have to be the official one you use but could be used as an easy tool to help mitigate future misunderstandings like this."]}
