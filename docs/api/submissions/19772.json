Someone could have been retired from an engineering career in another state, running for their local school board, and just talking about their background at a town hall and it wouldn't have mattered to them.\n\nGood news is he sued them in federal court and won.

Imo unless gender is directly involved we shouldn\u2019t jump to making it about that. \n\nFor example\u2014I think there\u2019s a very high chance this dude would\u2019ve said something similar to a younger man in the same scenario. It\u2019s an ego thing more than a man thing.", "The person who does the \u201cwell, aktulllllly\u201d about not being a professional engineer will do it to any sex.

Cut and dry.

Alberta has been lobbying hard to regulate it and with all the engineers in O&G here, they definitely take offense to people with Software/Site Reliability/Computer/System etc Engineer titles and especially Web Engineers... you aren't engineering anything, you're literally changing theme templates on wordpress...  and if you think that's bad, those of us in IT Architecture roles catch even more flak for having Architect in our titles.  I'm a Solution Architect, and have architected enterprise systems that affect/are used by millions of people, cost millions to deploy and involved the efforts of hundreds of people to deploy.  I am required to hold TOGAF, ITIL and COBIT certifications which are internationally standard certs and renew them frequently, and the work I produce has to adhere to a number of government/international/finance/industry standards.  But since there isn't a governmental body to regulate and license my title, if my architectural designs end up completely wrong, cause massive losses for the company and consumer, and maybe even loss of life, the worst that happens to me is that I get fired for misrepresenting/shoddy work and maybe slapped with a civil lawsuit by the company.

I just think it\u2019s hilarious when uptight dudes like you get all twisted up about small things (again, like LDE) while at the same time conveniently hand-waving away the actual sexism that\u2019s the topic of the post. \n\nI\u2019m sure this will go over your head, but I bet some rad sex with your totally hot girlfriend who \u201cloves your dick\u201d will make it all better.
