With the large shift of software developers jobs being labeled as engineering, there has been an increasing demand to start regulating the title. It doesn't so much have to do with the fact that people believe that software devs aren't engineers, but rather the fact that there is a level of accountability in conventional engineering fields that doesn't exist in software and the title engineer should be about accountability and reliability. It doesn't help that software engineering is also a type of field under electrical engineering (more specifically hardware engineering) that doesn't involve any of the high level programming languages that someone with a C.S degree will learn and generally requires an M.S in electrical engineering to work in.\n\nTo make a long story short, be a little more aware about picking and choosing when you choose the title as a software engineer or developer, especially in a professional environment. I've literally been in an interview where someone with a C.S degree kept referring themselves as a software engineer. Their resume wasn't even looked at during round two because it annoyed the shit out of a software engineer that had the aforementioned M.S. Working with a ton of developers? Call yourself whatever you want. Working with conventional engineers? Feel the waters before saying anything.\n\nThough, if you're around this asshat who's dating girls *way* too young for him, call yourself an engineer a few more times, just for me.", "NTA, you\u2019re working an engineer job.

I'm used to being poked at and teased because im the the only girl sibling (I have FOUR brothers \ud83d\ude1e), but Tom was just trying to be rude and always makes rude, sexist or racist comments.", "But her job title does have engineer in it so", "How is it \u2018fragile\u2019 to explain your actual job title? Lol", "That is literally her job title.", "lol you are an idiot. She stated her job title change. Someone said you are not that, so she corrected and restated her job title. I feel like you are the one getting emotional.", "Total engineer move to point out that they're... an engineer", "Sure", "Is Tom the ex's father?", "Well, somewhat. You can go through your whole career as a conventional engineer and never even start the FE exam. While it's the more the better, you *technically* only need a single person to have one.\n\nWith that said, that's where the idea of reliability and accountability comes in. If something happens, there's multiple regulatory bodies to investigate and dole out consequences relating to your professional career, even if you don't have a PE. There's absolutely nothing like this as a software dev, and that's where the desire to regulate the general title of engineer comes to play.\n\nThink of it like this:\n\nIf a bridge catastrophically fails, the engineers are investigated, PEs can lose their licensing, and all engineers involved can be basically excommunicated from all engineering organizations.\n\n\nIf software written by a software dev critically fails in heavy machinery, the engineers are **still** investigated, PEs can lose their licensing, etc etc.\n\n\nIf key software for an online service that has no engineers or requirements for a PE to sign off fails, there's zero professional accountability for those who made it. \n\nThis is where the problem lies and why critical software is usually written by people with engineering degrees. Not only are they more intimate with how the project is interfacing with the world, but no one wants to put their ass on the line for someone who isn't being held up to the same standards.", "Exactly. This is why I prefaced it with my experience coming from U.S engineering politics.\n\nI also know you guys take the order of the engineer a lot more seriously, which is very cool.", "I'm not quite sure how this changes anything I said. I can start a business and make my job title 'king of the world,' it doesn't mean I should start blindly referring myself as that.", "You need to calm down lmao. I've already told you I don't necessarily agree with the semantics.", "Oh sure, that's why I said it's only semi-related advice.\n\nAs for the scrutiny, AFAIK, there's no proper proceedings for it when it comes to software. In this example, you could be investigated by the government, but that's an exception and there's no other governing bodies to deal with a situation like this or have a proper structure of accountability.", "No idea about support engineers. It's such a vague term, unfortunately.\n\nSales engineers are basically sales reps that have a modicum of technical knowledge about what they're selling. Think the level of knowledge that a pharmaceutical rep has for medicine, but for engineering. From what I understand, no one really cares about them having that title simply because they aren't involved in developing or maintaining things.", "Also, I need to be supervised by someone who has the qualifications (which I am being)", "Out of curiosity, does your title change as soon as you graduate? As in you can automatically start using the title?\n\nI ask because here you need a set number of months of experience after you graduate before you can even apply for your license. Once licensed, you can use the term \"Engineer\" in your title, but using it before has to *very* clear that you're in training. Even \"junior engineer\" is not permitted for non-licensed members. It's a bit archaic here, but I was an \"engineering intern\" for years after I graduated university, and had to frequently explain that \"intern\" doesn't mean \"unpaid intern\" or \"student\", but that you're just working under the supervision of a licensed engineer. \n\nYou may want to research what's permitted by your local AHJ, even if the company is deciding the title for you, otherwise you may both be fined.", "In general, local laws don't define what a job title can/can't be. \"Engineer\" is a professional designation, not a job title. The only exception is the tech industry, where there are no professionally designated engineers at all, but plenty of \"engineers\" by title. Not a single country in the world has a professional designation of \"engineer\" in any tech field (unless you count electrical engineers).", "Which is why she didn\u2019t need to continue trying to prove him wrong?  Why does his opinion matter? It doesn\u2019t change her actual job title.", "Because she\u2019s trying to convince someone else that her occupation is valid.   If you know you are smart and someone calls you dumb; are you going to expend time and energy trying to convince them otherwise?", "Your point?", "Just so you know, the mere fact that someone doesn\u2019t agree with you doesn\u2019t make them emotional\ud83d\ude0aInsulting someone calling them names is what makes you emotional.", "She claimed that she didn\u2019t care what he thought, but she felt the need to emphasize that her job has the word engineer in its title\ud83d\ude02", "No, but in my cousin's words \"he's older and has a fancy job title \ud83d\ude0d\"", "> This is where the problem lies and why critical software is usually written by people with engineering degrees. \n\n[citation needed]", "I'm not at all familiar with this discussion so I can only read your side and others' sides and try to keep am eye out for more discussion.\n\nHowever, from this discussion so far it sounds almost as though this is a newer issue - possibly due to changes in the software field and how it's utilized I'm a changing tech world.\n\nWhat I'm not seeing discussed is anything related to broadcast engineering or integration for audio/visual. I work in one field and my sibling in the other. They have training as a mechanical engineer. I just fell sideways into it, but my official title in a large regional news network is Engineer. I know of some organizations and certifications, but as far as I can tell there's a lack of protocol for who needs to have those certifications and how wide the influence of the organizations is. It seems to be an older field than software engineering and has had engineers involved for longer, stemming more directly from electrical engineering  as far as I can tell. So far I know of no regulatory body or any use of that to hold engineers accountable.\n\nI'm curious if you have any knowledge or insight.", "I write software. I call myself an engineer. #fiteMe...\n\nIf titles start to get regulated in our industry because of my over application.. even better.", "It's rude as hell to tell someone who disagrees with you in a casual discussion to calm down. In case you wanted to know, so you won't do that in job interviews either :)", "Both my current and future titles are compliant with the laws there I live/where the company is located", "Telling someone something once is not \u2018expending time and energy trying to convince\u2019. It\u2019s literally just explaining something. She told him once and he got upset about it. That\u2019s on him.", "She called herself an engineer because she is an engineer. That is literally her job.", "You insulted op and I corrected you. You did make me laugh with how wrong you were, so it's true I did have an emotion lol", "Bless her heart", "Talk to every electrical engineer who now solely writes code for their company because they once casually mentioned that they're able to lmfao.", "Broadcast engineering is under electrical engineering and is regulated by the FCC (unsurprisingly) and IEEE. As a rule of thumb, certification is generally required when you're actually part of R&D rather than working in the field, but you definitely have to follow legal FCC protocols and standards made by various organizations.\n\nAdmittedly, it's not my field and I don't know too much about it. I'm sure there are broadcast specific organizations.", "Calm down, I don't care what people call themselves.", "It's also rude for someone to bombard another person with 4 different hostile comments on 4 different threads, because they disagree with something that I said (but openly stated I don't believe)\n\nI'm sorry that by number 3 or 4, I got a bit short with them.", "Ah, congratulation then", "She told him twice.  \n\n1.  He heard her say it to her friend, which is what prompted his comment. \n\n2.  She told him again, emphasized it and then claimed to not care what he thought.  \n\nTwo fragile egos.", "But why did she need to try and convince Tom what her job is?  And then follow it up with \u201cI don\u2019t really care what you think\u201d??\n\nTWO fragile egos were on display here.", "I didn\u2019t insult the OP. And \u201ccorrecting\u201d someone shouldn\u2019t have to entail calling them names.  And why are you getting emotional about complete strangers lol.", "Mechanical engineers too! We write the actual code and then someone is usually called on to pretty it up if there are outside end users. Right now I design offshore oil rigs and like half my team is just writing software.", "Okay, that tracks. I had to be aware of FCC regulations and filing procedures, related stuff in my precious job, though it was ultimately our CTO/Chief Engineer who was responsible for making sure my manager was taking care of those things. I actually remember reading about that in one of the SBE handbooks.\n\nI take it on the R&D end there's also certain persons who'd carry the bulk of responsibility because they ultimately have oversight, etc.\n\nJust not used to thinking about or being aware of those things.\n\nThank you for your reply.", "Her: my job is X\n\nHim: no.\n\nHer: it is literally the name\n\nHim: cries\n\nYeah, two egos for sure.", "lol sure you didn't dude. I said I laughed and you asked why I am getting emotional, then also used lol. So now you're asking why I'm getting emotional while using the same 'emotional' language, lol, in the same post. Now it's really getting funny.", "lololololol u mad bro lolololololol\n\nTake your trash back to 4chan. Kids like you are so utterly broken inside.", "Lmfao, oh man that's great.\n\nThis is why I always play dumb when it comes to coding. Once someone knows you're capable, they strip away all the fun stuff you get to play with and put you in front of a monitor.\n\nGranted, I design IC so it's not like I'm already at the monitor. I still refuse to download any IDE, though.", "> I take it on the R&D end there's also certain persons who'd carry the bulk of responsibility because they ultimately have oversight, etc.\n\nExactly. These are people who get professional engineering licensing, are required to approve every design, and have their name tied with that approval. If something fails catastrophically, they're the first people on the engineering team to be investigated.", "Correct.  All she needed to do was tell him once. Telling him again had no practical effect, as it didn\u2019t convince him of anything and was not new information.", "I\u2019m not the one calling names.  Now you\u2019ve got some imaginary narrative going on in your head that\u2019s quite amusing. \n\n But now I\u2019m bored.  So long\u270c\ufe0f", "Yeah, I had that happen in a previous job. This time I put my foot down. I'll look over code and help my colleagues, but no more than 10-20% of my time, and no way am I responsible for the full writting. \n\nI really like coding actually, but I want to be an actual engineer too and do all the cool fatigue and fracture and leakage and \"oh shit that hurricane's touching down on top of the rig\" stuff. Fun times!", "Eh, my thought process is fairly easy to follow. I'm sorry if you can't. Enjoy"]}
