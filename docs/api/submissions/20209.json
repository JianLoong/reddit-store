It's understandable that this issue may have been a sensitive one, but you were not wrong in what you said. If you did not feel that those losses were as impactful as losing a close family member such as your grandfather and pet, then you have every right to express that. It was not wrong of you to draw a line between your biological niece and nephews and those of your step brother, either. That line is a logical one to draw. If it was wrong of anyone to take offense to what you said, it was your half sister and your step mother for feeling slighted by your comments.", "NTA\n\nYou didn't have a relationship to even care about.", "**NTA** \\- Half sis just enjoys drama.", "NTA I have step nieces and nephews I've never met. I'd feel bad if a child died, but it wouldn't effect me either.", "NTA, you were honest and truthful but not intentionally hurtful.", "NTA. You didn't know her that well, if at all, so you have no emotional attachment.", "ESH \n\nYou weren\u2019t as impacted, understandably so, as you have no relationship to the stepbrother or his kids. But it\u2019s pretty rude to be so dismissive of your sister\u2019s feelings. \n\nWhat did you accomplish by saying that? You could have just as easily said \u2018it must be so hard for you, stepmom and step brother. Losing a child is truly awful\u2019 \n\nThis acknowledgement of their pain was what was needed in that moment, not a dismissive \u2018didn\u2019t impact me\u2019 statement. \n\nThat was incredibly cold for no reason at all.", "YTA:  Because while you probably weren't affected that much by your step brothers daughter death, your half sister was.  She saw that child as her niece and lost her at a young age.  And you basically said \"well yea it's sad but doesn't affect me\"", "YTA, but not because of the way you feel but because you could\u2019ve used a little more tact in how you said it. I get it, he\u2019s not close to you but the loss of a child is probably one of the most tragic events anyone could face.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Like I get that his death left a huge hole in her life and made her an orphan technically (her mom died when she was young) but that just isn\u2019t the case for me. For me it\u2019s almost like his death fixed a hole in my life. He\u2019s not there but at least now there\u2019s a reason for it. She also is still mad after 5 years that I made the choice to not go to his funeral and I don\u2019t appreciate her lack of understanding over it. Basically there\u2019s just a lot of bad feelings. So I get her drama and I\u2019m really trying not to make it worse but I also don\u2019t feel I should have to continue to have her put crap on me that isn\u2019t my fault.", "Exactly. It sucks and I know that. But it just isn\u2019t the same for me as for someone that actually knew the girl.", "It doesn't affect OP though, she never met the kid and has barely met the half brother.", "NTA, she doesn't seem to even try to be very understanding of you at all. You seem to acknowledge how she feels meanwhile she turns a blind eye to you, or maybe there's some sort of ignorance there. It kind of reminds me of my own situation with an older sibling who never really was able to live with us and our mom. My story is different but it's just kind of crazy to me that she can't see why you're not grieving over someone who's barely made any attempt to be the father he was supposed to be, or your step-brother's child, which I am also sorry for their loss because that pain must be immense, but if you don't really even know him how could that bond ever be established? I don't know the whole conversation you two had but it sounds like she was pushing that onto you.", "That\u2019s what I feel too and I have every since our father died. She wants me to acknowledge this sense of loss and grief that I just don\u2019t feel. I feel incredibly guilty for not feeling it bc I\u2019m a family oriented person but at the end of the day a biological/legal connection doesn\u2019t mean an emotional connection is there.", "NTA, and you don't need to apologize because you didn't even say it to your stepbrother. You said it to your half sister and she chose to spread it. I don't think I'd be bothered with any of them anymore.", "It\u2019s not about biological, it\u2019s about having a relationship and knowing them and watching them grow up.", "Don't feel guilty regarding your sperm donor or the stepbrother. You owe them nothing. Maybe you should take this as a sign to cut them all off and just focus on those who want you in their lives. No need to carry all that deadweight. And have a drama free life away from the half sister too. Don't do this to yourself, seeing these people who only cause you pain. NTA", "The loss of a child by someone you don't know and aren't related to is not a loss \\*you've\\* experienced, and it's pretty wild to suggest it is.\n\nMy guess is that your half-sister has you in a mental category labelled 'Things in common: Dad' and because your dad was close to her half brother, you're now somehow supposed to pick up that torch for him. It's pretty astonishingly oblivious on her part and doesn't speak to much in the way of maturity or sensitivity. You are absolutely NTA and you're absolutely not obligated to have her in your life if she's going to carry on like this.", "The problem is this would have been a sad and shocking loss for her sister. \nWhile OP didnt mean it like that, people tend to be sensitive around death.\nI respect the fact that you were honest about not having a personal stake in that death..\nIt's a slap in the face to a true griever when someone pretends to grieve a loss they didn't really have", "YTA, just because you think it does not mean you have to say it.  you can just say, \u201cyeah, sorry, i forgot.\u201d and it would have been the end.", "I'd say soft NTA? She mentioned something pretty horrific. You could've just said yeah and moved on. Or said it wasn't that tough on you but she must've been heartbroken and enquired about her. \n\nShe's obviously a clear TA because of blowing things out of proportion though", "NTA\nbut I still don't think you should have said something like this right now because he lost his daughter not that long ago and also half sister could be close to him and felt the same way when step brother's daughter died as you felt when you lost your grandfather I am sorry for your loss but that is not something you should have said to her", "NTA. That you don't mourn someone you haven't even met the same way as someone you actually know and love is totally normal.", "That\u2019s a weird response from her. Yes she is grieving a tremendous loss but it would have been more disrespectful imho to glom onto that loss if it didn\u2019t affect you. \n\nNah because the loss of a child is mind boggling. I don\u2019t want to think about it.", "It really irks me that ppl get upset over how you feel or don\u2019t feel about things... They are YOUR feelings and if you don\u2019t feel close or care, you have every right to that... You\u2019re definitely not the Ahole...", "NTA. You didn't say those things to your step brother directly, and your feelings and thoughts on the matter make sense and are valid. I can be sorry for someone when something bad happens to them without having to rip myself to shreds over it. Even if they are technically family. \n\nI have family members I haven't even met in person, if something bad, or good, happens in their life it's not going to personally effect me. I'll respond appropriately but will subsequently move on with my day.", "NTA . Why must people pretend a relationship exists when it clearly doesn't? There is a legal relationship via your Dad and his various partners, but in reality you probably know your neighbours far better", "You're getting downvoted but you're 1000% right."]}
