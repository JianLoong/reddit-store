We\u2019ve always had similar interests and have gotten along well. However, she (we\u2019ll call her Sasha) has always been a bit more care-free than me. When I got married two years ago, Sasha seemed a bit on edge at my wedding, but I did not pay much attention to it at the time (this detail will be important for later). She was also never the most friendly to my wife but my wife tolerates her enough to let me still invite her to events.\n\nFast forward to last night, when a friend of ours from high school had a birthday party. Sasha needed a ride to the party so I offered to take her. My wife was planning to go as well but had to back out last minute because she had to take care of a work issue. So it was just us in the car. \n\nThe party was a good time. Although I enjoyed it, Sasha had way too much to drink. She almost caused some problems at the party but she overall did not do anything majorly bad.\n\nOn the way back, Sasha out of nowhere started talking about how she\u2019s always loved me and was jealous of my wife. She said that she wanted to \u201cshow me what I missed out on by marrying that skank.\u201d Then she tried grabbing the wheel while we were on the highway to make me pull over so she could give me \u201cthe time of my life.\u201d She almost got us into bad accidents on the highway three times. After that, I was more than fed up with her and immediately after getting off the highway, I made her get out of the car (this was about 5 miles away from where she lives.) I got a car to come and pick her up and made sure that the driver knew she was intoxicated. Then I left her there alone.\n\nIt\u2019s now the next morning and I have not heard back from her yet. To be fair, it is still relatively early in the morning and she could just be having a late sleep because of her excessive drinking last night, but I\u2019m still a bit concerned.\n\nAm I the A-hole?", "created_utc": 1693223696, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/163k2qv/aita_for_leaving_my_best_friend_on_the_side_of/", "score": 80, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Maybe the next step would be to follow the uber to her house, just to make sure she got inside ok. But other than that what else could you do? \n\nAlso, make sure you tell your wife, better to find out from you.", "NTA\n\nYou stayed until the new ride got there.  That's the best you could do.  She could have caused a serious accident.  Time for no contact with her.  Do NOT reach out to her.   You don't need that in your life.", "NTA, you protected both your marriage and your lives. She could not be trusted to even sit as an idle passenger. Her drunk solution to you refusing her advances, was to grab the wheel and make you pull over. As you mentioned she almost caused 3 separate accidents. Getting her out of the car and calling her an Uber driver eas the safest option for everyone involved. \n\nAlso it\u2019s very rapey and creepy that when you refused her advances, she grabbed the wheel to make you pull over. \n\nI sincerely hope you tell your wife immediately and stay away from this woman. She does not have your best interests at heart.", "NTA  I feel like she kind tied your hands as soon as she started grabbing the wheel, not to mention the comments she made would have made you super uncomfortable. \n\nIt is a little fishy to take an Uber alone, and drunk being a woman, but again I have  friends that literally do that all the time, you just hear stories on the news about things that have happened. \n\nAt the end of the day it\u2019s her that needs to apologize to you though.", "[deleted]", "NTA. If you told me you just dropped her and drove away, I would have said E SH... but you made sure to send a car to pick her up. You did what you had to do.\n\nI am pretty sure she is mortified at her behaviour and is too embarassed to call you to apologize.", "NTA. You went so far as to make sure the new car got there? Better than I would given her after calling my wife a skank.", "NTA.  She really lit the bridge on fire by insulting your wife, but grabbing the wheel\u2026 that\u2019s freaking dangerous. I\u2019m also very glad you stood up for your wife and didn\u2019t tolerate her being disrespected. What on earth was she thinking", "Nta assuming the car picked her up before you left? The story was a little hard to understand. \n\nI hope you understand you can\u2019t be friends with her. It isn\u2019t a friendship it\u2019s an unrequited love and to pretend it isn\u2019t is disrespectful to your marriage", "NTA. Leaving a drunk woman on the side of the road is not great, but she didn't leave you with much other choice. She was putting you both in danger and sexually harassing you. If the roles were reversed, you'd be getting crucified for being an aggressive pervert.", "ESH only because I think you should\u2019ve waited for the car to arrive to pick her up. Bad things can happen to drunk people alone. That being said\u2026 that\u2019s sexual assault and if the tables had been turned, bet she\u2019d be calling police on you. You had absolutely no clue she had these feelings prior to this event? This behavior is a deal breaker, cut her off.", "Nta she hella weird", "YTA. Yes, she behaved terribly,  but you put her in a dangerous situation.  Yes, you called a car got her, etc, but you still left her, drunk and alone. You could have waited for the car to come to make sure she got in safely.", "It's hard to tell from what you wrote whether you made sure she got into the new car before you left. Also to be totally honest I would have also followed the Uber to her house and made sure she got dropped off safely - even with what she did she doesn't deserve assault from a driver. I'd go with a very soft YTA, but I only after the point where you called the car.", "YTA You put a drunk girl in the car with a stranger.", "I would've leaned towards E.S.H. cause her behaviour was absolutely out of line and being drunk is usually no excuse for that.\n\nBut I'm gonna say YTA.\n\nDo you have the slightest idea of the horrendous world we live in? If you do, just know you left a completely drunk woman alone on the side of the road at night. Do you know what could've happened? She could have been assaulted, raped, kidnapped or even killed.\n\nSure, you could argue she's not your wife so she's not your responsibility but you claim she's your friend and, however awful her behaviour was, it would've cost you nothing to wait there till the car arrived.\n\nShe probably won't hold this against you if she feels at least a bit of shame for her behaviour but she definitely should. You put her at risk, period.", "I\u2019m gonna say YTA based off the fact you left a drunk person on the side of the road", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I mean I could understand the ESH but the girl is definitely an asshole in the situation.", "NTA, but PLEASE talk with your wife about this before she tries to put the blame on you so she can separate you from your wife.", "NTA but it sounds like that friendship has run its course. Distance yourself from her and be honest with your wife about why (but she probably already knows deep down why Sasha and herself never got along).", "NTA. You would actually be TA if you stay friends with her after she clearly tried to get you to cheat on your wife with her, unless you clear things with your wife first.", "Inform your wife before she does, and nta. \n\nTbh when i was reading this i had a gut feeling it was going to end up exactly like it did, her getting drunk and jumping you, so other people may have suspected the same. Anyway, you dont want your wife to even suspect something happened, so do tell her everything", "Yup, OP needs to tell his wife before Sasha does; otherwise all hell will break loose.\n\nSasha disrespected OP's marriage, and OP did what he had to do. Besides, OP did more than what many people would have done in this situation. OP: NTA. You did the right thing. Now go on and tell your wife.", "Agree! The very most important thing to do is tell your wife.  Yes, I get that it will be hard and awkward but she needs to know what happened!  The dynamic between you and your best friend has changed forever and keeping your wife out of the information will be absolutely toxic to your marriage.  Deal with this as a team!", "I agree. Colleague was obviously unwell (out of it) and incapable of arranging a taxi home themselves (as her team members had advised her to do; work would pay under these circs). Suggested they book the taxi and make sure she gets in ok. Thought that was doing my bit. All sorted.\n\nNext time I saw her I asked how she\u2019d been, hope she had felt better soon\u2026and response seems a bit off.  So I ask if everything is ok\u2026she says when she got home and to her door, the taxi driver came up behind her and tried to follow her inside. Close call that she was able to stop him\u2026", "I did leave before the driver arrived. I was afraid if I waited she would try to get back into the car or start something worse", "Well said. I totally agree.\n\n\n\nIf he hadn't left her *alone* on the side of the road, I'd totally be saying nta, but leaving a person (especially an intoxicated person, and **especially** a woman,) on the side of the road, at night, that's crazy dangerous.\n\n\nHe should've, at least, waited nearby and kept an eye on her, until her ride came, just to ensure no one snatched her up.", "> Do you know what could've happened? She could have been assaulted, raped, kidnapped or even killed.\n\nThe risk of something like that happening to her in the 10-15 minutes it would've taken for the Uber to get there is minuscule. Contrary to popular believe, most places in western countries do not sport carloads full or kidnappers or rapists, prowling the freeways.", "I\u2019m confused, he said he talked to the driver and made sure they knew the situation. But then he left her alone.\nDoes he mean alone of the side of the road or alone with the driver?", "I get you called somebody to come pick her up but what if something would\u2019ve happened to her between the time you called the car and by the time they got to her", "Yeah I def hope so. But still, she was overly drunk on top of being a young woman alone on the road.\n\nI personally would never leave somebody like that on the side of the road without making sure they're safe before leaving. Woman or man of course. That makes no difference.\n\nAnd anyway, I prefer not to take any chances. Just in the past month there were several group rapes in my country. All by the hands of young and apparently normal guys.\n\nI can only imagine what kind of scars such a terrible experience leaves on the victim so if I have to leave, I prefer to wait and know the other person is safe before going away.", "He wrote \"then I left her there alone\".\n\nI guess he talked to the driver on the phone and then left.", "Agreed - but I can\u2019t really fault OP for not wanting to stick around with someone who was already sexually harassing him, and endangering his life. Protecting himself has to be a priority in this situation.", "NTA, she endangered you both by grabbing the wheel, and not to mention the fact that she wanted to SA you. You didn't abandon her with no ride, she'll live.", "YTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"Then she tried grabbing the wheel while we were on the highway \" ... You were right to kick her out.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"I got a car to come and pick her up and made sure that the driver knew she was intoxicated. Then I left her there alone.\"   YOu would have needed to wait until the car was there, or you should have called the police to keep her safe.", "YTA, you left her there and just drove off. You don\u2019t know if she got in the car and if the person picking her up was being safe. And you\u2019re also pretty dense, about three sentences into your backstory I knew Sasha was in love with you. You are not a good friend.", "NTA", "Nta", "Not criticizing OP but where did it say he waited with the woman until the ride came?\nThe post says he left her alone and that\u2019s why he felt kind of bad"]}
