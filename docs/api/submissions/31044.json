I want to serve myself and my then girlfriend didn\u2019t want to serve me. It\u2019s some old world Dutch thing and made me super uncomfortable. My MiL couldn\u2019t understand why her husband wanted to be served but I didn\u2019t.", "Some people really need to understand the concept of \"not knowing what you dont know\" or in this case \"not knowing what they don't know\", before they get on these high horses of expecting everyone to magically educate themselves or others.\n\nHonestly these things happen, even within your own culture people sometimes have different expectations and habits leading to misunderstandings.", "I am Indian, and while I also say no the first time out of habit, I probably wouldn't even notice if someone else didn't", "This is what I was thinking. \n\nWhy is the other culture the de facto one needed to be followed? OP was gracious, said thank you, and moved on with life. Falling over to be fake humble is just wrong. OP was slightly off balance as they weren\u2019t expecting the envelope, they said thanks and then they moved on. Nothing more to do here. Don\u2019t second guess yourself. \n\nAnd who the hell returns a gift or denies it when made over an app or in person because they expect the person to keep insisting it be accepted. That is tiring and rude af.", "This. BF is the AH for not explaining cultural norms & supporting you fully. There's something amiss w/after the fact explanations that cast you in a poor light. NTA, raise your expectations regarding BF.", "Spend 1000 hours straight just reviewing all aspects of your culture with one another? Like what are you talking about? Cultures are lived and learned through experiences like this. \n\nBf might not have ever thought to mention this difference if this hadn\u2019t occurred.", "Other than the gifts on wedding invites issue, everything they've said just boils down to \"don't try to reject a gift unless you genuinely want to give them a chance to take it back\". Its not even so much a rule as much as it is actual concern for the person giving something away.", "I can't tell if you are serious, but it seems like common sense", "I mean, it's likely that OP doesn't generally observe Diwali, so following the lead of the family that does on how to observe the tradition makes sense.", "It\u2019s because OP is a woman. How often do you hear about the roles being reversed? Almost never, because women are expected to give up their own families and cultures and assimilate into their husband\u2019s.", "It can be tricky, though, from the boyfriend's perspective. How do you warn someone about things you don't really think about? It only comes up afterwards.", "Things like this that each family does can be talked about, it\u2019s not just learned living it via experience, it works both ways. You don\u2019t just walk into something not knowing family traditions, both partners normally talk of things like that. It takes 1000\u2019s to even a life to really of getting to know people too. Communication is key in a lot of things than just learning/experiencing which also requires communication in itself. So I stand by NAH simply miscommunication from not communicating enough about the little things.", "Common sense is culturally relative, and your comment is a great example of how these things can be complicated", "If it's common sense, it obviously has no bearing on customs.  I include my own country's customs in this, as some can seem odd to people from elsewhere.  I'm VERY glad I had the opportunity to live overseas in a very different culture, to be able to look back at my own country from an outside perspective.", "This isn\u2019t just about Diwali, though. It\u2019s about gift-giving more generally.", "Except it's not a heavily enforced thing. I would probably say no the first time based on habit, but I wouldn't blink twice if someone else didn't. Also this is kinda only related to monetary gifts, not gifts in general. It's still weird how worked up bf is getting over it"]}
