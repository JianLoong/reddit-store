Please note, he got permission from both the bride as-well as the groom to propose during the after party. My brother Carter (26M) had married his now wife Elaine (25F) about 2 months before me and Marks engagement. Elaine was my bully in high school, and I cannot even bare to understand why my brother would ever marry such a witch. She gave me death threats in the 10th grade, violently attacked me in the 11th and in the 12th grade I was hospitalised for an eating disorder and severe depression after Elaine, multiple of her friends and our classmates picked on me for my size. I didn\u2019t attend their wedding, however I did receive an invitation. A month prior to sending out our wedding invitations Elaine had realised that she never received an invitation and that Carter had one but a no 1+ was in order. Elaine called me out a family gathering around Christmas time and explained how she doesn\u2019t understand what she had done to me that was so wrong that she wasn\u2019t invited. We were at the dinner table when she began to cry and mumble about that nonsense, I looked at her and laughed and then began to rain on her about our high school days and how it affected me mentally and I can never forgive her for how she had treated me. Mark had exchanged comments about how poorly I was treated by her and she made comments about how I should just get over it, in a fit of rage I screamed at her that she would never be considered family to me. Carter was in shock and ended up leaving with Elaine, a few moments after this me and Mark also went home in anger and fury. Much more things were said at this gathering, but I\u2019m not comfortable with sharing the comments that were exchanged about me and my husband. Not even an hour later I received multiple calls and texts from both my side of the family as-well as her family telling me how much of a bad person I am for not inviting her to something special and that family should always treat each other right. I\u2019ve also received multiple calls and messages about how Elaine is hurt about our argument and would like me to apologise, even my father and mother are informing me that it would be the best thing to just let it go and make amends. Me and Mark were astonished by this and the way  was being treated that we have decided that our wedding will be a small ceremony with our close friends and family excluding those who were rude and careless towards me. It was a beautiful ceremony and at the end we didn\u2019t regret it one but, but I\u2019m still receiving unkind calls and messages about how the way I reacted was childish and that I should let it go but I simply can\u2019t.

Shame on your brother for marrying someone so awful.", "NTA. SHE needs to make ammends if she wants to be considered family by you. She did the damage, if she really cared she would apologize and do what she can to try and make it right. (Whether you accept and if it could even be made right of course is up to you). The least she could do is take accountability instead of telling you to \"get over it\".\n\nIts sad that some of your family won't stick by your side during this when they saw the affect it had on you growing up.", "NTA. There's a quote by the classical Greek philosopher Bion of Borysthenes (as quoted by Plutarch) which discusses how the Gods play with human lives; **\"Boys throw stones at frogs in jest, but the frogs die in earnest\".**\n\nSo to a bully, what they're doing is a trivial thing. A few moments of fun with their friends, before they go on with what's important in their lives. Later in life, they've completely forgotten they did it, because it was never important to them. They can't imagine why you'd ever bother remembering it happened, let alone to hold a grudge. It was *nothing*!\n\nBut to the frog - the person being bullied - it is *far* from nothing. Studies have shown that being the target of bullying alters pediatric brain development, and has permanent consequences that persist for a lifetime. It's not something you can just 'get over', because your brain is different now, in consequence. Decades after the fact, bullied people have elevated rates of depression, substance abuse, heart disease, and suicide. It may be a jest to the bully, but the bullied die in earnest. Being severely bullied as a child shortens your life expectancy *by a decade*.\n\nThe OP has reported how being a target had profound consequences on her, that included eating disorders and hospitalization. In other words, she was at serious risk of dying. If that was a physical injury - the result of a beating, say - then no one would press her to forgive and forget the attempted murder. But because it's 'just' bullying, and because *they* weren't the target, they think it just a joke. Childish fun.\n\nThe OP needs to tell her family that what Elaine did nearly killed her, that she still suffers its effects, and she will *never* not hate Elaine in consequence. If Elaine does not think that what she did was serious, it is high time she learned that for the OP, it was deadly serious. She nearly died in earnest.", "NTA\n\nYou get decide who goes to your wedding, who is a part of your family. There is a world full of people enabling evil behavior, you are fully free to cut those people out of your wedding/family/life also.", "NTA. \u201cIf it\u2019s not the consequences of my own actions!\u201d\n\nYou deserve to feel safe in your weddings from bullies.", "Hmmm, a lot of \"friend/relative married my bully\" posts here.  Is this really that common, they all seem about the same to me. NTA if it is factual, but I have doubts.", "NTA, I don\u2019t understand how your PARENTS of all people saw what she did to you and are telling you to make amends with \u201cfamily\u201d. It\u2019s hard but I\u2019d honestly uninvite them and your brother from the wedding all together and really reconsider if you want them around in the future", "Screw all of them. Anyone who encourages you to just apologize and make peace\u2026 it was a long time ago\u2026 blah blah blah\u2026. Has never experienced what you have. And Elaine is embarrassed for being called out and held responsible for her horrible actions. \n\nMake your wedding about those who love you and support you. \n\nNTA", "NTA\nGo no contact with anyone who is still harassing you.

I'm assuming she never took accountability or apologized to you. You need only people that support you there on your big day. I would hire security, I wouldn't be surprised if she tried to crash it. After all were all faaaammillllyyy", "NTA. There's this weird tendency for people to side against the person who's the most upset in these kind of situations, which works out great for shitty people. good luck", "NTA your wedding = your rules. Not to mention it\u2019s your life and you get to decide who you keep relationships with.", "NTA but INFO: Was this the first time your family heard about what Elaine had done to you? Why were they surprised?", "NTA- I was just reading someone saying abusive people don't want forgiveness, they want absolution.", "You know, I seem to say this a lot in a different context, but it applies here: \"Family is who loves you; that is all, and it is everything\". It was my Uncle W's favourite saying - and please note that I was not related in any legal or genetic way to him... But it didn't change the fact we were family.\n\nLegally, this woman is connected to you - that does NOT make her family; it just makes her the woman who is legally connected to your sibling. \n\nLegal 'family' matters for contract law, inheritance law and... possibly tax law. That's it. \n\nGenetic 'family' matters for medical reasons, genetic inheritance of disease, and making sure we don't inbreed. That's it.\n\nWeddings, you'll notice, aren't on either list.", "NTA...she terrorized you in school. There is no way you don't have PTSD from her. Go NC with your family. Family doesn't JUST get along because their family. My in-laws went crazy on my husband and I. You know what...my 21 and 17 year old don't know them. My husband hasn't had a seizure since we cut contact. And we are happier then ever. 22 years of marriage and honestly their \"heat of the moment\" it doesn't matter attitude was the best thing that happened. We left them behind and don't miss them a bit.", "NTA - your brother definitely is for marrying someone who treated you so badly.  \nYou should really go no contact with your brother and low or no contact with everyone taking their side.  \nIncluding your parents", "I\u2019d be worried about how her kids would treat your kids.  \nIf her and your brother don\u2019t see what she did as wrong what are they going to teach their children about how to treat people", "You apologize? Why?  You're not in the wrong.  The physical and mental scars from being bullied don't disappear when everyone involved turns eighteen.  Unfortunately, you may need to cancel the invitations sent to the flying monkeys in order to have a peaceful day.", "ESH. the way you treat her now is similar to how she treated you in childhood. Does she deserve it? Maybe, especially if she never apologized.

Kids often fail to see how it can affect somebody mentally when they are \u201c joking around \u201c because 9/10 times it is never a joke for the other person and they will always take words to heart. I truly do need to inform my family that what she did was basically attempted murder whether or not it was done physically or verbally.

I\u2019ve seen multiple stories of which this has happened to them, when people consistently hear of one person or just generally being around a society that revolves around them (which unfortunately was the experience with me and my brother as my entire higher school year was about me being bullied and that experience and negative impact it had on me) they often grow an attraction towards them.

Congrats on your nuptials and that it was a beautiful day", "But, even if you eventually forgave her, it doesn\u2019t mean that you would want your childhood bully at your wedding.

You know the free will that Elaine used to bully/abuse you.", "Brother may not have known. Part of being bullied is feeling like you can't tell anyone. That your teachers won't believe you; your parents don't believe it. Even if a complaint gets made, the bully lies, the other kids back them up, and the teacher decides that they can't tell what happened, so they'll give everybody a mild punishment.\n\nAnd then the next day, your parents send you back to the same fucking school with the same bullies, and *nothing* has changed. And that's what you've learned by grade 4 or 5, *before* the bullying gets serious. And when it does, what you've learned is to tell no one what's going on, because your experience has been that doing so is useless: no one will help, anyway, and you'll just get retaliated on. So you keep it all inside.\n\nSo doubtless brother knew that little sister was depressed as a teen and had an eating disorder. He likely didn't know that bullying was behind it, let alone who the bullies were. He was likely completely shocked at the OP's outburst. *Because OP was still keeping the code of silence*. She kept quiet when he started dating Elaine, and quiet when he married her. She didn't go, but she didn't say a thing about why not. She sent him his invite to her wedding, and again didn't say anything about why he got a single invite.\n\nIt's only when Elaine was clueless enough to press the issue and had the gall to claim she was being victimized by OP that OP exploded and let loose a decade of pain and resentment, shocking everyone.", "Understandable. \u2764\ufe0f", "Exactly, it\u2019s not something I will ever forget as it\u2019s a memory of something that traumatised me.
