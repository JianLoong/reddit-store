Keep in mind we haven\u2019t had contact in a little over a decade,and here\u2019s why. \n\nSo I grew up morman in the middle of nowhere in Utah. My parents were super crazy religious and for a while I was too. Until I was about 13. I realized I was bisexual and eventually became atheist and got involved in some shady stuff involving a certain herb. \nI had to hide all of this from my parents because I knew they would flip. Well at some point,they found out. At 14 years old I was sent to wilderness therapy, specifically Trinity Teen Solutions. Now,the thing about wilderness therapy is that it\u2019s horrible. For two years I was treated horribly in this program. I could fill a book with horror stories from that place. When I was 16 I was finally allowed to go home. A couple months later,I was kicked out for,as they put it,not appreciating all the I\u2019ve done to fix me. I was homeless for about a year and a half before I got my life together.\n\nObviously,we cut contact when I was kicked out. Now that they\u2019ve found out I\u2019m pregnant I\u2019ve been bombarded with messages by them trying to act like nothing happened and let them be apart of my baby\u2019s life. They are essentially messaging me several times a day to yell at me about not telling them I was pregnant and then not responding to to all their messages.
