You can have more than one baby shower. They didn\u2019t invite your family is because they don\u2019t want to interfere with what they were planning for you. The fact that you don\u2019t realize that shows your immaturity. Your bf and SIL\u2019s support of your decision to walk out says a lot about their character as well. No wonder they don\u2019t like him. I hope having the perfect baby shower was worth losing your good friends because they are definitely done with you after this.", "Hard YTA.\n\nIt is common to have a \u201cwork baby shower\u201d, \u201cfriends baby shower\u201d, \u201cfamily baby shower\u201d - and they are all valid. The fact that the party your friends organized for you did not fully match the fantasy in your head was not a reason to scoff and leave. This behavior in fact underscores their initial concern of you being too young: in paint you as an immature brat.", "Eh, YTA. Your friends were doing something nice for you. And if you guys are all younger, direct apologies can be tough and awkward and some people just aren't emotionally mature enough to have a straight forward conversation about something so big. I think the surprise was exactly what you said, a nice gesture and a genuine attempt at an apology.\n\nYou can still have a baby shower with your family. Just because someone threw you a surprise shower doesn't take away from one with your family. They could've just had a Christmas party and not invited you at all. But they threw a party *and* made it entirely about you.\n\nThe timing of voicing their concerns was probably wrong. But they seem like genuine friends if they're making sure you're doing what's best for you. If they weren't, they'd probably be shitty friends.\n\nAlso for what it's worth, if none of your friends like your boyfriend, you should really try and understand why. No one knows you like your friends do and they may have valid reason.", "YTA,\nFor sooo many reasons. They weren\u2019t excited enough. Their apology wasn\u2019t exactly how I wanted it. I hope it\u2019s the pregnancy hormones because you sound insufferably self centered. Nobody was saying you couldn\u2019t have another baby shower with your family. Just wow.", "YTA and I'd be really surprised if you could recover these friendships at this point. \n\nA good friend is honest with you. You're young and unmarried. Questioning your choice to be a mother right now is *valid*. Do you even have your own place with room for a nursery? Even a rental?\n\nAfter 30 weeks, it's clear you're going to make this ill-advised choice and they stepped up and threw you a baby shower. Because they're fucking amazing friends. And you had a hissy fit over the guest list and left. You do know you can have two baby showers, right? One with friends and one with family?\n\nI think you've burned bridges here. Friendships are already hard to keep when one person has a kid and the rest don't. Your behavior has tanked what little chance you had.", "YTA. Your SIL can still throw you a shower. And sometimes, when \"no one likes\" a certain person, sometimes the \"certain person\" is the common denominator. And your stomping off out of the shower illustrates that maybe your friends are right about your level of maturity.", "YTA. People have multiple baby showers (eg work and family) all the time. It doesn't have to be weird unless you make it weird.\n\nYou made it weird. You went beyond weird and straight into AH. You could have shown gratitude for them and then let your SIL plan the family party, and it would have been fine. Wow, your response was so rude. I wouldn't blame all of your friends for ditching your ungrateful arse.", "I wouldn\u2019t want to be friends with you. You are\u2026. A lot.", "YTA and I am concerned you\u2019re not mature enough to be a parent if you can\u2019t even handle your friends throwing you a whole party just because it didn\u2019t meet all of your expectations.", "So your friends didn't show enough support to you when you announced your pregnancy, so then they tried to make it up to you by throwing you a party of support, and you walked out because you're mad they're showing you support. Make it make sense. YTA.", "YTA\n\nIt sounds like your friends were a bit shocked as they weren't expecting mews like that.   \n Their responses may come across a bit underwhelming but they do sound as though they care about you and and are looking out for you.\n\nThey went to a lot of effort with the baby shower and you aren't limited to one.  You can have as many as you like so you will be able to have your family one too.  \n\nThey aren't telepathic so may not know what you want and from the sounds of it you are very specific in what you have dreamt about all these years.  \n\nIts quite possible you have ruined these friendships especially if you don't try to do something to repair them.  It sounds as though you threw their hard work and thoughtful gesture back in their faces.", "YTA. You sound pretty jaded because all your friends didn\u2019t jump for joy like you pictured in your head. Friends aren\u2019t meant to go along with every little thing. A real friend would talk about pros and cons. My buddy is 150lbs overweight. We talk about diets and all that all the time. Is it a hard topic? Sure. But that\u2019s what friends are for. They were concerned and probably have reasons to not like your boyfriend. Ones you clearly left out. People don\u2019t just not like someone for no reason most of the time. I would also agree that you\u2019re pretty young. Are you established in life yet? This isn\u2019t the 50s anymore where a grocery bagger can put his kids through college. But hey alienate all your friends and burn bridges so when shit hits the fan you have no one to lean on.", "YTA. \n\nI\u2019m 25, and if one of my friends told me she was pregnant, I would for sure ask her if she felt ready and if I had concerns, I would express them. You have only been with your boyfriend 2 years, which at your age, is a pretty short time frame to be making a lifetime commitment like having children together. It\u2019s also a rough economic environment right now for a lot of millennials and gen z-ers and babies are expensive. It\u2019s definitely not unheard of and it works out for plenty of people, but I think it\u2019s normal for your friends to have concerns and express them. Caring about someone isn\u2019t blindly supporting them without raising any questions, they would be bad friends if they did that. \n\nThey expressed concern, you told them to back off, they did and threw you a party to try to share in your excitement and then you complained about that too. There\u2019s no reason you couldn\u2019t have enjoyed a celebratory moment with your friends and also had a baby shower with your family.", "YTA.\n\nThey did put a lot of work in & you were ungrateful. \n\nJust... have another shower with your family?", "YTA. You did overreact to a very nice gesture. Your friends were clearly concerned for you but threw you a shower in support anyway. A person can have more than one baby shower. Different social circles might opt to throw you one but you wouldn't expect your coworkers to invite family and vice versa.", "Sorry, but gentle YTA. This surprise baby shower by your friends, who maybe don't know all that a baby shower typically entails, or maybe did just want it to be a lil baby shower for you and your friend group. That doesn't mean you still can't have the baby shower you and your SIL are planning that does include family and everyone you want. Were these friends included as attendees to this shower your SIL is planning for you? Maybe they were just hoping to smooth over ruffled feathers and make up for their initial lackluster response to you pregnancy. Ultimately, however, it's up to you if you feel like bringing them forward into you life as you take this big step.", "The lack of awareness is so wild in these posts \ud83d\udc80\n\nPlease don't be real lol", "YTA! Can\u2019t believe you just walked away after all the effort they put in!", "YTA. You can have more than one baby shower. They made this one for friends. You could have still gone forward with a separate one for other friends and family. It\u2019s not unusual to have two or more. You turned your nose up at your friends\u2019 event by saying it wasn\u2019t good enough. What more could they have done to show you they care? You owe them an apology.", "yta my sister is pregnant and has had 3 baby showers. one with family one with friends and one with work. she very much loved by different groups of people in her life. maybe instead of being defensive you should have felt the love and realized your SIL could still throw you a shower no rule book says 1 per baby", "YTA - your friends were putting effort into making things right. You're still allowed to have your family-oriented baby shower after all.", "YTA.  This was a friends' shower. You'll have a family shower later. Getting upset that your 'first' shower wasn't your perfect vision is insane. Are you going to be like this if and when you get married?", "YTA- multiple baby showers are very common. I don\u2019t know my friends family members. I wouldn\u2019t even know how to invite them. \n\nYour friends spent a lot of time doing this for you. It may be worth it to apologize to them and explain that you (clearly) didn\u2019t understand that you can have more than one baby shower and you overreacted. Hell, this is the one time you can truly blame your hormones if that helps. \n\nAlso, YTA for thinking they need to apologize for not reacting to your announcement as you thought they would. The party WASN\u2019T an attempt to apologize because they don\u2019t owe you an apology. The party was because they care about you.", "YTA - Sorry sweetie. Your friends were trying t do something nice for you and there's NO reason you couldn't have had another baby shower with your family as well, people do it all the time.", "YTA!!\u2019 They won\u2019t be your friends for much longer.", "YTA - you probably didn't mean it, but you really did overreact. \n\nYOu should also take a close look at your expectations of people. I mean, might your friends actually care about you and be concerned with your situation with having a baby with a boyfriend you haven't know for very long? Or did you just want them to fake it to make you happy?\n\nAnd that's fair enough, but obviously they all got together, talked about you and said 'we should do a nice shower for her, from all of us, to make her feel special about the baby'. And you ditched it because it wasn't including your family? Why should a friends shower include family? It's like they put up green decorations and you thought they should be yellow.  No right or wrong here.  \n\nExcept you.  You were wrong to expect too much and too specific things.  Now YOU owe THEM an apology.  Will you give them one?", "Yta so much. You can have a seperate family baby shower, friend, coworker etc. This was clearly a way to celebrate you and show you they cared. \n\nGood luck having any friends left now willing to do anything for you ever again, if they even want to associate with you again.", "Sorry YTA, you can have more than one baby shower. Your friends were trying to do a nice thing and you blew them off because it wasn\u2019t what you imagined?!? Now you might not have those people as friends.", "YTA.  You can have a friends baby shower and one with your family. It sounds like they were trying to make up for their initial reaction, and you're still punishing them for expressing concern.", "Another post of someone having a baby and getting upset because the world generally doesn't give a shit.  \n\n\"Look what I did!  I had sex!  Be proud of my massive achievement!\" \ud83d\ude44", "YTA\n\nWhy are you allowing your \"dreamed up vision\" of \"your first baby shower\" interfere with you appreciating this baby shower for what it is?", "You know you can have more than one baby shower. Your friends wanted to do a friend group shower for you. YTA. You were rude and ungrateful. I think you owe some apologies and need to grow up before your baby gets here.", "YTA. Sounds to me that you have expectations in your life and is upset when people don\u2019t react or do as you want or expect them to. I hate to break it to you but you are going to be seriously disappointed the rest of your life", "Wow OP. Your friends truly sound awesome!! Please consider how lucky you are.\n\nThey were concerned for you when you shared that you\u2019re having a baby with someone you haven\u2019t been with for very long and that they don\u2019t even like. I\u2019d be interested to hear about why none of them like this guy and why they think he will be a crappy dad.\n\nCome on. They CARE about you. Then, they decide to throw you a shower to show you how much they care, and this is how you treat them? You sound exhausting OP. YTA.", "YTA, just because your friends threw you a baby shower doesn't mean that your family isn't going to. Many women have more than one for that reason, one with friends, one with family. I would be upset if I had put all the work into a shower and the guest of honor just walked out. They tried to do something nice for you, it was a nice gesture and you crapped all over it.", "YTA. Hopefully, you are now their ex friend. Because  I sure as fuck would not want to be your friend after that.", "YTA- lots of groups have small showers for their own little group.  Its a lot of responsibility to plan a huge shower.  My work friends invited me to 'girls night out' which ended up being a surprise \"work shower\".  I wasnt upset that my frigging aunts werent there.\n\nLet me get this strait- they dont react enough and you get underwhelmed.  They turn their \"friends-mas\" into a baby shower to celebrate you and youre upset about that too??  make it make sense.\n\nalso- they didnt apologize bc they probably dont think they need to.  Just because they didnt have a reaction that YOU deem to be worthy, they didnt react horribly at all and they dont owe you shit.  But they STILL went out of their way to celebrate you and you ruined it.  tsk tsk", "You seem like A LOT. I don\u2019t mean that in a good way. I don\u2019t know how valid your friends\u2019 concerns are about your age/maturity, or your bf\u2019s capacity for parenthood; but it seems like them all being in agreement probably means that they have some legitimate concerns. Either way, you\u2019re 24 and you should realize now that the world doesn\u2019t revolve around you. Not everyone is going to be super excited about *your* \u201cbig news\u201d. They *did* try to do a nice thing for you, ultimately, and you took it in the worst possible way. You really seem like you have a lot of growing up to do, and in quick order, since you\u2019re going to be a parent soon.  Have some introspection about how to be different than you are\u2014 that is to say, YTA", "YTA. Your friends tried to do a lovely thing for you, specifically in support of this news you're so happy about, and at least partly or maybe even mainly to try and make up for how they reacted at first. And you almost seem to think they've ruined your dream party by... throwing you an extra party? What?\n\nHow close to the baby shower in your head would it have to have been for you to think the people \\*throwing you a party\\* were genuine? If your mom was there but the cake was the wrong flavour, would that also have mean they were just trying to \"clear their consciences\"? Gold balloons instead of silver, would you have forgiven that? Do you think people don't \"mean it\" at Christmas when they give you a present and it wasn't what you pictured yourself opening?\n\nYou can still have the \"dream\" baby shower, though you'll be lucky if any of your friends bother trying to please you again. This was an incredibly sweet gesture by some people who clearly care a lot about you, and you seem to have been determined to find the negative in both it and them.", "YTA Try being grateful and a better friend than you deserve.", "YTA- I can\u2019t honestly believe you don\u2019t know that.  You still could have had a baby shower with your family.", "YTA and by the sounds of it, your friends are right, you are too young to have a baby.", "INFO: Do u think a baby is going to make ur relationship stronger and better? That it\u2019ll bring u and ur bf closer together?", "Of course YTA. First off, unless it\u2019s their baby or some close relation to it, most people couldn\u2019t care less about someone\u2019s baby. Secondly, they probably realised you where upset with them and pulling away, so they decided to invest their time and money into throwing you a baby shower. As others have said, you can have more then one baby shower. You\u2019ve just blown all those friendships out of the water, which is a massive shame, because having kids, especially when your friends aren\u2019t around can be very lonely.", "They were extending an olive branch- by throwing a baby shower for you. It's one baby shower. I don't really understand the attachment to your \"first baby shower.\" I hope your employer were to throw the first baby shower, you would be happy people did things.\n\nUnless there are details missing (like it really wasn't a baby shower), YTA. I don't know why they didn't include your family, but you can have more than one baby shower. \n\nThey probably owe you a real apology for how they reacted to the initial news, unless there were some big reasons to question you.", "Nta they are asses please dump them and money on from the toxic friends the ones who truly love you will come through for you.\n\nAlso op the one who call you an ass do not know anything about you or the so called friends just ignore them", "NTA.", "YTA. They were being super kind by planning all that and you can have a family one later! I can\u2019t believe you walked out. Especially since you\u2019re so young, do these friends even know your family? They put in a big effort for you and you bailed. You\u2019re the bad friend. Not them.", "Do your friends have your families contact info? Because mine don't, and my family doesn't have theirs either. Have a separate party with your family. Your friends did a nice thing, and you shat all over it because you're family (who again these friends might not have even had info to contact weren't there.) YTA.", "Yta. Your friends wanted to do something nice for you. You can have more than 1 baby shower, I mean, it\u2019s just more shit you don\u2019t need to buy yourself for the kid.", "YTA. To put on a surprise for you like that after they clearly have concerns about many different things about your situation, is an incredibly nice gesture. It\u2019s common to have multiple showers. You totally overreacted.", "Yta. Why can you not have more than one baby shower?", "YTA. You sound like hard work. Be grateful they threw you anything.", "Why can't you have more than one? I had three: a lunch my aunt on my father's side threw at a restaurant, one at work organized by my colleagues, and one my mom ams sister hosted at my house for that side of the family and my friends. The more people that want to celebrate you the better!", "YTA\n\nThe world does not owe you a huge reaction.  Then you get a surprise shower and it not good enough. Your comments also paint the picture of a very selfish person, having a hissy fit people are siding with you.", "JFC you are such an insufferable AH.\n\nYTA", "YTA.  The reality of caring for an infant day to day is going to his this person hard.", "Yta\n\nI'm sure any info I could ask for was left out on purpose. \n\nYou really rushed past the whole \"they don't like the dad\" thing. There's most likely a reason they don't like the dad, and there's most likely a good reason they don't think he'll be a good father. \n\nIf all of your friends, *all* *of* *them*, have the immediate reaction of concern, rather than spontaneous joy, over you announcing pregnancy... there's prly a good reason for concern *there* too.\n\nThen they actually throw you a baby shower, they might not think you and your bf are good fits to be parents, but they do it anyway. I doubt it was because they felt bad about voicing their concerns, because they're was nothing to feel bad about there. They put in a lot of effort, you said that yourself, and rather than enjoy your party, you stormed of because it wasn't the party you wanted. \n\nOn the demanding, or expecting them, to apologize. They have nothing to apologize for. They are your friends and voiced their concerns, that's what friends do. They also don't need to be checking up on you, you're an adult. They voiced they didn't agree with your choice, they don't owe it to you to go \"how's the baby, do you need anything\", you made your adult choice, so it's up to you and your bf to live with that choice.", "YTA, they didn't respond to your news enthusiastically enough? What were you expecting, pom-poms & jazz hands? And good friends would be concerned at the news since you haven't been with your boyfriend for long. They're concerned that you will be single mom! AND you can have another baby shower with your family. What is wrong with your friends showering you with joy? And you expecting an apology for what? Not living up to your expectations of baby news response? Dang, girl! You overreacted & YOUR response was rude. You owe THEM  an apology.", "YTA. Can't believe you walked out.  So entitled.  Your friends sounded like they were asking valid questions about your plans and relationship.  You aren't even engaged to this guy, right?  Why don't they like him?  \n\nFurther, you stated your sister was working on a shower for you.  Lots of people have multiple showers - - why did your friends have to invite your family when you have your own family working on one.?\n\nNo need to worry about it now.  Your friends probably aren't your friends any longer.", "YTA. What a preggo-zilla. You weren\u2019t smothered in good wishes at your announcement; they had concerns. THOSE ARE FRIENDS. \n\nThey threw you a friends-group shower. THOSE ARE FRIENDS. \n\nGet over this absurd notion that the first of your showers has to be the family one. Sis can still have that family shower. \n\nFor all I know your workplace is having one too. THOSE ALSO ARE PEOPLE WHO CARE. \n\nEmbrace the caring environment.", "\u201cBut we did this for yoooooo!!\u201d\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t ask you to\u2026\u201d\n\nNTA", "Wow are YTA.  You do realize that unlike a wedding you can and probably will have many baby showers all for the same baby right.... Your family might throw you one, you friends group might throw you one, work friends might throw you one...  You have some deff growing up you need to do, hopefully before you start to raise the baby...", "Congratulations on the baby! I do sincerely hope motherhood and your experience with your newborn is wonderful. But realistically, there are going to be moments where it fails to live up to your expectations and I\u2019m concerned that isn\u2019t something you are ready to face. \n\nYou said you have \u201cdreamt up your baby shower for years.\u201d That is very bizarre and, honestly, kind of concerning. I do hope you understand the reality of a baby. This is not going to be a cute doll or even a puppy. This is a human being who is completely dependent on you and who will, at times, cause messes and unpleasantness. You may not have \u201cdreamt up\u201d, and I assume you mean dreamt of, the first time your baby projectile vomits everywhere but it is still going to happen. \n\nSo, in the nicest way possible, you need to grow up. It\u2019s great to have dreams and ideas to look forward to but you also need to learn how to become okay with when that dream doesn\u2019t happen. Your friends did you a really nice thing. I\u2019m not sure why you aren\u2019t able to see that. And as other people have pointed out, it\u2019s very common to have more than one baby shower. \n\nYTA. Having a baby is hard work. You\u2019re going to want to keep your friends, if only so you can still have people who you can turn to for adult conversations. Apologize to them. And grow up. For your sake, I sincerely hope they are willing to accept your apology.", "NTA what the hell is it with all the Y T A??? They ignored her for months and then decided to throw a surprise baby shower for her and invited people she didn't even know! Seems like they just wanted to save face because they very clearly didn't care about your pregnancy at all for months", "YTA!", "NTA I didn\u2019t have a shower for my first for the exact reason I wouldn\u2019t have my family there. My mom died three years ago and my grandma and aunts all live down south. They sent me things that was that. My friends even asked if I wanted a shower and I told them there wasn\u2019t much of a point bc I only have them there are three of them) I also explained that I\u2019d rather have a nesting party. Aka a deep clean of my entire house to prepare and help with setting up an area for baby. They hired a maid and my MIL helped with the baby area. \ud83d\ude02", "Surprised by how many people are saying yta\u2026 hard NTA from me. I\u2019m 23f and 18 weeks and have had friends who are genuinely supportive and friends that show up every now and then for show and the level of tone deaf this situation is on their part would make me upset too. To have that be the initial reaction would cause anyone to pull back. Then for them to randomly throw you a shower that doesn\u2019t cater to any of your values/needs. I get maybe it\u2019s a nice gesture but if they\u2019re good friends they would try harder to actually be caring for and supporting you. Not throwing you a shower with people you DONT EVEN KNOW?!?! sorry. No NTA all day. The people in these comments are insane", "I already know this will be down voted but NTA\n\nYes you could have multiple showers, but I think everyone is missing the point.\n\nThey haven't reached out in 5 months!!! If they had they'd know you only wanted 1. \n\nAnd they seriously couldn't be happy for you when you announced? They aren't children, they could have voiced their concerns at a later date, and not ruined the joy of sharing your happy news", "Honestly, soft YTA, because if anyone puts any kind of real effort into surprising you with a nice party, it should be appreciated. You can be disappointed if it didn't go as you wanted or didn't have the guests you wanted, but it sounds like they did something nice for you and it was to celebrate you and your pregnancy.", "I think everyone is missing the fact that they invited people that OP barely knew. Im going with ESH", "This is the most mental take on a surprise baby shower I've ever seen. You don't need a baby, OP. You need help. YTA.", "Ok, I'm really completely befuddled why you're expecting your friends group to invite people who aren't part of the friends group for the party they threw you. It's not as if you can only have *one* of those baby shower things, is it. \n\nSo they were overbearing and judgy when they learned about your pregnancy, and you have every right to take your distance or decide that what they do to make up for it isn't enough. But in how you describe the situation you sound a lot more TA than they do.\n\nETA: I just reread the \"dream about my first baby shower\" bit, and hard side-eye. Woman, find something worthwhile to dream about!", "YTA. a small friend baby shower doesnt mean you cant have a family baby shower...or work baby shower...or baby shower with each side of the family.", "Going to against the grain here and say NTA.\n\nA lot of people seem to think that jumping to concern/questioning is a normal reaction for friends. It's not really a reversible decision for most people. There's no value in criticising the decision immediately. I'm 24 too, and am currently pregnant. I know if my friends reacted like that to my pregnancy I would feel incredibly hurt. I wasn't with my partner long either when we found out, but my friends saw how excited and happy I was, so they shared that excitement with me when I told them. They had concerns, but they voiced them to me privately and constructively after sharing my joy with me.\n\nFor them to not even acknowledge the pregnancy for 5 months and then throw a baby shower with no thought or consideration to what you'd actually like, after how they responded to the initial news, I would definitely feel the same way.", "Honey, NTA. \n\nLiterally every other comment focus on only the climax and ignore even trying to understand the whole post. I bet ya they ain't even had any baby showers yet because they're kids and those who claim to have had more than one etc are just making up to jump onto the bandwagon with all the other bad comments.\n\nYou may have overreacted when you announced it out of the blue and they may have been in shock. But the surprise baby shower? With *STRANGERS* ?!! And the months leading up it they haven't even thought of asking how you were and apologize for not being as enthusiastic as you hoped due their shock. The impromptu baby shower definitely is to deal with their guilt of acting down instead of happy when you announced it.\n\nYou had every right to walk out that baby shower filled with strangers. Had they done it with ya know, just you and them, then you would be bad to have walked out. But no they had to invite people they know to show those people that they care about your pregnancy in case it ever should surface they were negative towards you first. This baby shower was just to keep check of their social status. I'd say it's better to have those bridges burned as they'll definitely just use you and your child as social cloud one way or another.\n\nDon't mind and listen to non of these negative comments and have a healthy pregnancy!", "NTA. Screw what everyone else said when they said YTA. These people NEVER apologized to you for saying you were too young (at 24?!) to have a kid, they don't like your boyfriend, etc. they made your announcement miserable for you.\n\nThen they barely talk to you following your announcement. Invite you to a fake Christmas party. Still not having apologized to you at all. They then EXPECTED you to just \"celebrate\" the baby they said you shouldn't have, not just with your partner, but at all because you're too young? Where was the apology? Why should these people be allowed to celebrate something they didn't want for you?\n\nThis is a big NTA OP. You walking out of there without going off on them after how they treated your news was not only mature, but damn right calm for someone whose hormones and emotions are all over the place because you're pregnant. I applaud you.\n\nI had my first child at 22. I had no baby shower. I had my second at 24. I threw my own baby shower, except no one showed up. That told me exactly what I needed to know about my \"family and friends\". People tell you exactly who they are, it's up to you to listen. Your friends showed you who they were when they told you that you shouldn't have a baby when you announced your pregnancy. And they threw it in your face when they threw you a baby shower with people you don't know rather than your family who supported you.\n\nAgain, NTA.", "Apology?? For what? Not going over the moon when you announced you were pregnant? YTA for being hung up on this idea you\u2019re owed an apology and for being so rude for walking out of a kind gesture that somehow doesn\u2019t meet up with your distorted (and completely wrong) view of polite society.

The fact that this had to be a surprise party is all you need to know about how messed up the so called friends are. \n\nFor god sake people, they recommended she terminate. Hard NTA from me.", "Did your friends even know they had anything to apologize for? Did you let them know that their initial reaction hurt your feelings? Either way, your reaction to the surprise shower seems highly exaggerated. It was an attempt on their behalf to either apologize or, if they didn\u2019t know anything was amiss, it was an attempt to shower you with love. I think it was a super sweet gesture and it is completely normal to have multiple baby showers with different friend/family groups. Sorry but YTA and I don\u2019t see your friendships with them continuing. It sounds like a lot of work and planning went into the surprise Friendsmas. Can you imagine what they all felt when you left? Yikes.", "INFO: did you hand them a script so they'd know how you wanted them to react? Did they get a little time to rehearse your script?

Were you trying? It sounds as if they love you and tried to express congratulations while also being concerned for you, and when they realized it's what you wanted and that you pulled back because of their concern, they tried to make it up to you by celebrating you the way you and giving you the attention you wanted when you announced. \n\nI don't know you or them, so I don't know how well they did or didn't know you wanted a kid right now, or how well they know your family, or why *all* of them don't like your bf, but if you're not talking to them much, maybe they just assumed your family was already hosting you a shower and this was something between friends? I don't really see how you wanting to plan a shower with your sister and family is impeded in anyway by your friends also showering you separately. \n\nI think maybe you should take a look at this from a different perspective, one that isn't centered entirely around your wants and expectations. If these friends have been good to you in the past, why further strain these friendships over this?", "YTA. I feel bad for your friends. Sounds like the issue is stemming more so from concerns about who you are choosing to step into parenthood with, age playing a smaller role. I'm curious what their previous concerns about your partner are.", "Oh.. I was ready to side with you but absolutely YTA. Your friends threw you a friend shower. And lucky you, getting more than one shower thrown and paid for by other people! You even said, they put in a lot of work and effort. So what if they didn't jump up and down as much as you wanted them to when you announced it, and because they care about you, they brought up genuine concerns SINCE THEY ARE YOUR FRIENDS. You wanted them to be happy and celebrate, and now that they are, it's not good enough. Either it's hormones, or you are difficult to please in your everyday life. There's no way for us to know which it is. But don't worry, it's the last special wvent your friends will bother you with after your behavior this time. And when nothing special ever happens for you, and you wonder if it's maybe your fault, just know for sure: yes, it's your fault.", "Yup, YTA. you did in fact overreacted, maybe because of the hormones.

Hosting this surprise baby shower was a really kind gesture from your friends. You mentioned that your SIL was planning your perfect baby shower as well, so you could have just looked at this one as a bonus event to celebrate your baby, knowing that you will also have a separate celebration with your family just like you pictured it. It was rude to walk out and inconsiderate of all that they put into this party for you", "YTA, this is so unhinged. Motherhood is lonely, especially in the beginning. Congrats on pushing your friends away though for doing something most people would be incredibly thankful for lol. Insanity.", "What is wrong with you? You can have two showers.

The weird thing here is they\u2019ve literally thrown you a party and put the effort in like you said, and you\u2019ve still found a way to be ungrateful as if it\u2019s not enough.\n\nETA; when you say your friends didn\u2019t even try to apologise, that\u2019s literally just delusional, you should be apologising to them.", "Hard YTA\n\nYour friends are being good friends, and you are a bad friend.\n\nYou are not entitled to a party at all. You are not entitled to gifts. You are not entitled to anyone being happy for you. You are not even entitled to other people's concerns for you.\n\nYou are not the main character. Your pregnancy isn't important to them or their lives. They were trying to show concern for you, and you got mad at them. They, in turn, try and support your decision, and you get mad at them. \n\n\nYou are well on your way to losing your friends", "YTA. \n\nAll I\u2019m seeing in your post is you, you, you.

You\u2019re the one having a baby. Not them. They have every right to be concerned for you. Just because they reacted differently than you wanted or expected doesn\u2019t mean they don\u2019t care about you. They showed they care about you by addressing their concerns like good friends should. Maybe it was the wrong time to do that at your announcement, but you did surprise them with an unexpected pregnancy announcement. \n\nFurthermore, instead of telling them you felt bad about their reaction, you distanced yourself. You blame them for your feelings being hurt when ultimately they don\u2019t have to feel the same way you do.  When they try to do something nice for you you act like a selfish diva and walk out. You were rude. You were being mean. \n\nJust because it was the \u201cfirst\u201d baby shower thrown for you doesn\u2019t mean any other one is less special. People often have more than one baby shower. A friend\u2019s shower, a work shower, a church shower, a family baby shower, in some cases more than one family baby shower if there\u2019s a blended family or members who don\u2019t get along well. In laws throw one, and mother throws one , step mom throws one, etc, or maybe because of distance between families.  They all are special. \n\nThe point is, you put all your eggs in one basket expecting everyone to come to one shower and it wasn\u2019t what you expected so you threw a fit.  You insulted your friends who still cared about you enough to throw you a party. If they were trying to make up for their guilt, they would have apologized sooner. And you overlooked the fact that their friends, your acquaintances, actually cared enough about you even though they don\u2019t know you well, to come share and celebrate with you, trying to shower you in happiness and love and it still wasn\u2019t enough. You still act underwhelmed. They can\u2019t win with you.", "Hard NTA and everyone piling on you clearly hasn't had kids... \n\nFirst off, I'd be super weirded out if I had a baby shower thrown for me when literal strangers were in attendance. Like, no, I don't want to talk about my future children with you. I literally just met you five minutes ago. \n\nAlso... People *register* for baby showers, so that the gifts given to her are actually wanted/needed. Or are these \"friends\" just creating more things for OP to do because she's gonna have to go around and return all of the stupid gifts that she was given that she probably doesn't even want. Mom's typically have an idea of what products they want to use on their child... \n\nLastly... It's really shitty to do a bait and switch on people. Being told that you are having a friend's giving and then being put on the spot to say. Hey, we threw a shower just for you. I would be pretty upset as well. They ruined your announcement and shit talked your partner. Now they've decided to throw you a shower without even checking in to see what you wanted to do. And put a bad taste in your mouth... I'd honestly go very low contact with that group as a whole.", "NTA. \n\nJust because people do something nice doesn't mean you have to accept it. \n\nFirst, even if the news was a shock, or that they don't like your boyfriend, they have the complete ability to not say all the things in their head. I've been presented with plenty of things I disagreed with or just found shocking- getting engaged after like 3 months, pregnancy when there is no boyfriend, getting back with ex we don't like- and you smile and nod and internally think about how and IF you should ask any questions or poke around. They were unkind and judgmental, and they didn't make any attempt to own up to what they did. \n\nI think this is probably a mix of them genuinely wanting to say they are sorry (the olive branch) and making themselves feel better. But instead of doing the hard work- calling you and apologizing- they did the fun work of throwing you a party and expecting to just sweep their behavior under the rug. And you didn't want that. That is why you walked out.\n\nYou walked in to a room knowing how these people feel about your partner and your pregnancy, and you didn't want this gesture. It reminds me of when a man proposed to a woman on like her graduation day, making a moment about her about him. Your friends decided their gesture was more important than how you would want to celebrate your baby. They centered themselves in your story. \n\nYou didn't want this, you weren't ready for it, and while a surprise baby shower is nice and there can be other showers and all that, you didn't want it from THESE people. That's totally fair. And the fact that they again centered themselves- we put work in, be grateful, don't ruin OUR plans- instead of coming to you with \"we didn't think you would react this way, how can we make this right\" tells me you probably made the right decision.", "YTA. It's not uncommon for people to have multiple baby showers. I had two for each of my kids. One with friends and one with family. Your friends put in a lot of hard work to make this baby shower possible and you were still bitter about their reaction. You could have had fun at this baby shower and continued on with the plans for the other one.\n\n You were underwhelmed with how they reacted to the news. That's a valid feeling. They were obviously concerned. Though they probably could have come about it better. But honestly, would there have been any way to tell you about their concerns that you would not have been offended by? True friends are supposed to be able to be honest with one another, even if the honesty isn't going to necessarily make the other one happy. You knew they didn't like your boyfriend. There is probably reasons for it.  Friends get to sit on the outside Looking in and seeing everything that the people in the relationship don't see. On top of that, friends also get to be the shoulder to cry on when something doesn't go right and bias can kick in due to that. \n\n\nYes, you've probably ruined this friendship. It's going to be pretty hard to come back from that.", "YTA\n\nBUT....it might just be emotions from pregnancy. No one gives a party just to apologize for something they didn't even know they did. You can still have a family baby shower. Baby showers are not mandatory anyway. Focus on the baby, being the best mom for the baby, and less about what this baby can do for you and your goals. It's going to be all about the baby for eighteen years. You still have time to pull it together and be a great mom. It sounds like you have people who care about you. Let them care about you.", "Here's the problem with imagining how events will play out and how others will react: your friends weren't given the script you wrote.\n\nThe baby shower shows that your friends want to support you during your pregnancy & after, despite their concerns. They really don't have anything to apologize for because they probably are not sorry for expressing their worry about your boyfriend being a good partner for you.\n\nA true apology is one where we reflect on our actions or words, realize we were wrong, show remorse, and vow to refrain from repeating those actions or words. The only honest \"apology\" they might be able to offer is \"I'm sorry your feelings were hurt,\" which isn't really an apology. \n\nIt doesn't sound like they were outright rude; just unenthusiastic and expressing true concern.

I\u2019m guessing those friendships are gone now, so it\u2019s more a learning experience. \n\nYou could have had another baby shower for close friends and family and still been appreciative of the one they planned for you. Yikes!", "YTA. Sounds like your friends were shocked and expressing genuine concern as it seems that you're making rash decisions outside of the character that they've come to know. Seems like their concerns were valid considering your behavior. Wanting children is great, wanting to be a parent is great, most people support that life decision at the right time, circumstances, and with the right partner. If you're too young, too poor, with a questionable partner, most reasonable people will express concern. \n\nYou were upset about them not acknowledging your pregnancy, and when they attempt to celebrate your pregnancy amongst FRIENDS, you throw a fit because your family isn't there? Your constant moving goal posts aren't reasonable. You're hyper sensitive with poor communication skills. \n\nIt seems like you don't care whether or not your friends accept your pregnancy, it sounds like you're still pissed that they judged you and don't think that you're making a good life choice.", "I think you really need to talk to these friends. Do they know how much their initial comments upset you? If so and they did this anyway without trying to apologize first they are absolutely TA. Springing a party on someone is not an apology. Especially if said party includes people you don't know and no consideration for who you would want there. \n\nThey definitely screwed up with their initial response, and you are NTA for being upset. It's fine for them to have reservations about your boyfriend if these things come from a place of genuine concern, but they did not go about this the right way. Attacking you right off the bat is not going to put anyone in a receptive mood. And as for the party, well, surprise parties are never a good idea unless you know for a fact someone would want that and not including your family is pretty awful. That being said, walking out probably did do irreparable harm to your friendship. \n\nHonestly, y'all just completely failed at communicating here. Your friends didn't go about voicing their concern for you in any kind of constructive way. And the party was a misguided attempt at an apology that clearly didn't work.

Cut to two years later after a nasty divorce, we told him how much we hated her. The first thing he said was, \"why didn't anyone say anything?\" To this day we all feel terrible about it.\n\nYour friends are a decade younger than we were and braver than we could have ever been.

You will have a family shower.  MAN, YTA!", "YTA. Babe, you ARE young. Your friends were trying to be honest and make sure that YOU were sure and that YOU were OK. Sure they had initial hesitation, but then they stepped up and threw you what sounds like a beautiful shower that they put a lot of thought into. Young moms can be great moms, but you sound very immature and like your entire personality is wanting to be a mom. Which gives off the vibe of.. you want an accessory, not an actual child. Your friends probably were right to question your boyfriend being ready bc he sounds just as immature as you if he's agreeing with your actions. You have a lot of apologies to give out, but I would not expect  forgiveness.", "I am currently pregnant and have family planning a baby shower and then friends and coworkers planning a separate one. \n\nYTA - these ppl went out of their way to plan this for you & nothing is stopping you from also having the other shower your SIL is planning...", "i had both my babies in the middle of lockdown and didn\u2019t get a single chance to celebrate with friends or family and you are sitting here complaining about your friends throwing you a surprise shower??? at least you got one, many other people who had children in the last couple of years didn\u2019t. \n\nyou sound entitled as heck and don\u2019t deserve your friends.", "I am not a kid person.

I'm not sure how close your friends are to your family, but I wouldn't expect my friends to coordinate something like that.

You are choosing to settle down and start a family with a guy they don't like and when they tried to be supportive anyway you walked out on them.

I can get being underwhelmed by their response, even if they have your best interest at heart and even if they are a bit correct. We want people to be happy for us to get the things we want. But as far as their \u201cinvolvement\u201d with your pregnancy or your \u201cdream\u201d baby shower\u2026 it sounds like you are letting your expectations be a joy killer, and some of your expectations are wildly unrealistic because you lack experience.\n\nThe best advice for you right now is to ruthlessly kill your expectations of child-rearing and co-parenting because I can guarantee you that your expectations will be flung out the window multiple times before you find your stride. \n\nI\u2019m NOT saying that raising kids can\u2019t be awesome and amazing, I AM saying that setting up an idea in your mind when you don\u2019t have a clue can cause more disappointment then just rolling with the punches.", "YTA.

A bad friend would cheer you on and encourage you to make poor choices because they secretly want you to fail! Sounds like you had good ones that actually cared. \nThe second issue I have with this\u2026. What\u2019s wrong with two baby showers? I had one for friends and one with family.

People went to lengths to give you a large gift, be humble and show appreciation. Having unclear standards for other people\u2019s emotions is crap. And the excuse that they didn\u2019t ask about your pregnancy is also crap, people don\u2019t generally care about other peoples pregnancies.

There's no real mention of how your friend's act before other than you knowing they didn't like your bf whose also notoriously absent from this story only to let you know that you were right.

You noticed that and were an AH. Claim hormones and apologize.", "YTA, first of all. Your friends organized a nice party for you to celebrate your pregnancy, you spit on it and walked out. Second of all, based on your description of events, you do sound immature so that\u2019s a valid concern. Which leads me to believe their concerns about your boyfriend are also reasonable. How long have you been dating? How long have you known him? Was this a planned pregnancy for both of you? Do you have a reasonably stable job/living conditions?", "You know, at first I was Y T A but I am going to change this to an ESH. \n\nYou, for the way you reacted. While it might be pregnancy hormones, sure, an explanation isn\u2019t an excuse. You\u2019re young and I will cut you a small bit of slack. You said you still kept contact - how much? They might not have realized how much they hurt you unless you told them. People don\u2019t always react how we want them to, which goes both ways here. I don\u2019t know that they felt the need to clear their conscience, but I do feel that this was a misguided attempt. I do agree your tone here sounds a bit insufferable, and I think that is why people (myself included at first) jumped straight to Y T A. The line about \u201creally caring about me\u201d was a bit low - while it seems you may not have known people can have multiple showers, it doesn\u2019t change the impact of what happened from both sides. \n\nThem, for inviting a bunch of people you don\u2019t know. I think my opinion would be different had it just been them. I wonder if you would have been okay with that? Considering the types of games played at baby showers, I can see that being SUPER uncomfortable with people you\u2019ve never met in your life! How awkward! I don\u2019t think the shower itself is a problem as a small, intimate shower could have been a beautiful gift. But it seems like they didn\u2019t take your comfort level into their planning process. It seems like they were trying to do something nice, but got caught up in themselves. \n\nIf you are interested in saving the friendship, know that it could be too far gone. They\u2019re justified in being a bit hurt and you\u2019re also justified in being hurt. But this might be something you have to learn to be okay with. Do you still really care about them? Do you still want them in your life? You have some rough decisions and potentially tough conversations coming up, but this could be the end of the friendship. You\u2019re just going to have to learn to count your losses and move on. \n\nAnd don\u2019t expect the gifts from the shower ;) /sarcasm", "YTA MAJORLY!! Why can't you have 2 baby showers? One with friends and another for family. It's not uncommon for have more than one shower for your different circles. They put in effort to do something nice for you and you basically just spit in their faces and walked away. If they decide to cut you from the friends group, don't be surprised and know that it is all your own doing.", "YTA they made a real effort to give you a baby shower. It was a shower for friends and you would still have a shower with family. Your reaction was over the top and strange, and makes me wonder about why your friends were less than excited by your baby news. You\u2019re 24 with baby fever, a bf that none of your friends like and you got pregnant quickly in this relationship. There\u2019s a lot of red flags here. Should they have voiced their concerns at your announcement? No, but it does sound like they were genuinely concerned about you. A good friend will tell you when you\u2019re making bad decisions, but not try and run your life. They voiced concern once and then let it rest, because you were decided and they respected that and support you. \n\nThe people who constantly gives you reassurances, tell you everything will be fine, despite glaring warning signals.

Words only mean so much and the fact that you walked out. Basically you just shoved It back in their faces and showed them how your age really has something to do with it. That's my opinion, though.", "Gently YTA.\n\nYou totally overreacted here due to some secret dream you did not share with these people, so they had no way of knowing.\n\nYou could have still had your family baby shower your family was planning. \n\nOne thing did not take away from the other.

WHY DO YALL CARE ABOUT HER SITUATION WTF. her friends have known her for years so she's more than likely talked about it with them. some people really do know that they're meant to be a mom and they make it happen, not your fucking body. she was already planning a baby shower, what makes yall think she wanted more than one. i would hate to be heavily pregnant and constantly traveling because everybody wanted to throw me their own baby shower. some things you can't help, obviously but from what it sounds like they could've had 1 big baby shower. if you don't have anything nice to say, just shut up. your friend announces that she pregnant and the first thing yall do is question if she's making a good choice. and she had a get together and actually announced it so it's not like they had reason to think you wouldn't keep it.", "I'm actually surprised at the \"YTA\" rulings. I don't think it's about the baby shower at all. OP didn't feel like her friends really cared or supported her. Or cares about what she wants.

I think OP needs new friends", "I\u2019ll take the inevitable downvotes and say ESH \n\nYou really don\u2019t know their motivations for throwing the shower so that part was in your head.  You might have had a conversation with them instead of walking out. \n\nBut your friends sucked when they told you their frank opinions about the baby.

That\u2019s pretty normal.", "YTA you thought it was a friendmas, and you were surprised that only friends were at the baby shower? When you were already initially going to friendmas? Also I\u2019d never rely on or expect a friend to invite my family members, mostly because they probably wouldn\u2019t even have their contact information in the first place? Like sure maybe your mom, but how will they invite any cousins or your grandma? Be forreal.", "YTA. Multiple showers is normal. They've come around to you having a kid and they've done something amazing and you ruined it.", "Yes, YTA. \n\nNo one should have a \"shower of their dreams\" in their head, because no one should expect one or feel entitled to one. If someone feels moved to organize a shower for you, the appropriate emotion is gratitude and the words that should be coming from your mouth are \"thank you\". \n\nStop trying to second-guess the motivations of people who are trying to do nice things for you.", "Major YTA.  First of all, why would they all be super crazy excited when you announced?  And making a big thing with a cake etc is just weird.  Also, their concerns were totally valid.  And lastly, lots of people have multiple showers.  You sound like a brat.", "YTA. you & your \u201cbig kid\u201d boyfriend are in for a whirlwind of growing up fast. at 24, i would have been horrified to learn any of my friends were pregnant. they tried to make it up to you.  \ni hope you have plans for somewhere to live when this relationship doesn\u2019t work out.  \nyour friends are probably done with you. try not to jump down your family\u2019s throat if your baby shower doesn\u2019t live up to your perfect fantasy.", "If you don't believe it was done from a place of love, what do you feel it was done for?

Super. That always goes well.\n\nYou are immature. Babies raising babies. Just what the world needs.\n\nYTA.", "YTA, who tf made a rule that you can only have 1 baby shower? You were totally rude to your friends for very superficial reasons. I\u2019m not surprised at their \u201cunderwhelming\u201d reaction to your pregnancy. You sound very immature and self-centered\u2026raising a baby gonna be a rude awakening.", "YTA. This was a wildly inappropriate response. Sure, your friends could have verbally expressed more support for your pregnancy. But a shower IS a gesture of support. Not only that, it\u2019s a thoughtful and generous effort. \n\nMoreover, showers aren\u2019t something an expecting mother traditionally plans and dictates. It\u2019s a gesture done FOR her. So it\u2019s a bit distasteful to criticize the planners for not designing the event to your specifications. \n\nNothing about this party ought to have stopped you from enjoying a separate shower with your family. It is very common for a person to have multiple showers with different circles.", "YTA- people have multiple showers.

I guess I\u2019m missing something here about the laws surrounding baby showers. . .", "Yta. You expected a massive reaction when you told them AND when they threw you a party, you acted like a brat.", "I agree, you overreacted to a nice gesture.  Their party for you doesn't replace your SIL's party, it's an additional one.

Your village just got a lot smaller.", "YTA, big time. People worked hard and spent money to do something for you and you walk out because it wasn\u2019t exactly what you dreamed of??!!  I hope you raise your child to be more appreciative than you were.", "YTA\n\nThis is a common thing. Work shower, friends shower, family shower. The host decides what the party will be and all you have to do is attend. \n\nThere were 4 showers thrown for me, 2 surprises, and 3 had nothing to do with family. If you need a family shower, you need to tell somebody that. This party was not lacking anything. \n\nYou absolutely overreacted and we're very very rude. You can probably assume many of these friendships are now over.", "YTA. You can have more than one shower. Friends may not want to sit around with your co workers, who may not want to hang with your family etc. it\u2019s really common. \n\nI understand your hurt at their initial reactions. It\u2019s sad no one previously apologized. But you said they put a lot of effort into this. You said when you assumed your SIL was involved that you were happy and excited about this event so it must not have given off a weird vibe that wasn\u2019t you or last minute throw together. I can\u2019t think of a more appropriate way for a group of friends that weren\u2019t supportive of a pregnancy announcement to apologize than to organize a shower and give you an apology that showed thought and effort while also providing you support. Again, it\u2019s disappointing that no one verbally apologized before this but if you still wanted to be friends with them, a shower clearly showed they wanted to support and celebrate you. You didn\u2019t give them an opportunity to complete this potential apology. I\u2019m not sure what you wanted them to do.", "YTA you can have more than one baby shower. Huge yikes", "Why can't your sister also throw you a baby shower with your family?\n\nIn what world can you only have one baby shower?\n\nYTA", "YTA, just have another baby shower with your family. It\u2019s really not that hard. And the fact that you didn\u2019t consider that seems to show a level of immaturity. Your friends were really trying to do a nice thing for you and you spit in their faces. Don\u2019t be surprised when they don\u2019t want to be your friend anymore.", "YTA and in all honesty if this is indicative of your maturation level I could see why they may be concerned. Most people have baby showers hosted by friends, family, and work mates separately. You really shit the bed on this one op. I don't think you have to worry about friendships with these people anymore.", "I\u2019m torn on this one bc you can have more than one baby shower. They put a lot of effort into doing something nice for you\u2026though I find it weird they didn\u2019t provide gifts. That\u2019s the entire point of a baby shower. It sounds like more of a celebrate you party vs actually something helpful. You guys are young so maybe they misunderstood what a baby shower is? Either way them not supporting you and being hung up on a past ex isn\u2019t great. You seem to have a stable relationship with your boyfriend(idk why people downvoted that one comment). I think you had a childish response but maybe you need to talk to them about how you feel? It\u2019s possible you need to move on from the group. ESH", "Soft YTA.\n\nListen, I get it. No matter if the criticism was valid or not, the last place I would want to be told that I wasn't ready to be a Mom would be in a group setting at a moment that I thought would live on as one of the happiest of my life. It left a bad taste in your mouth and it's easy to assume the worst possible of intentions after that moment. I would strongly argue that good friends would have waited for a more appropriate time than the baby announcement to make their concerns known: that wasn't it.\n\nHowever, that being said, your reaction to the baby shower was an overreaction. If you value these relationships, it's time to start having some one-on-one discussions and come with hat in hand. Tell them how you felt, tell them you are sorry that your reaction to a nice gesture was such a negative one and try to rebuild the relationship.\n\nYou have a baby on the way. The right friends, good friends, are going to be critical in the next months and years. If the friendships are worth saving, it's time to apologize.", "Yeah, YTA.

Good luck!", "YTA  by 30 weeks most women have already had their baby showers.  Perhaps your friends assumed you already did and THEY were the ones that weren\u2019t invited.  \nYou did over react.

You should be so happy your friends wanted to do something nice.\n\nAdditionally, perhaps you are too young and haven\u2019t known your BF long enough to know whether he will be a good dad. Sounds like you were very focused on getting a child and not so much on whether the circumstances were right.", "Oh, definitely YTA. You definitely overreacted. You said your friends put in a lot of work to throw you this party. They put forth the effort becuase they felt you deserved it. You threw that back in your face. Honey, if you are going to be raising a child, you have some growing up to do. Are you the first woman you've ever met to have a child? Have you never go to a baby shower for a co-worker?\n\nJust so you know, people also have multiple bridal showers. Looks like your friends won't be throwing one of those for you, though.", "I don\u2019t see why you couldn\u2019t organize your own baby shower and invite the people you wanted after enjoying the surprise one your friends threw you.. one doesn\u2019t exclude the other in my opinion. YTA, sorry.", "Respectfully, get a grip. \n\nYou've got friends who care about you, enough to be happy for you AND have concerns about your current circumstances.

You're assuming the worst and criticizing them for throwing you that surprise baby shower as a means to clear their conscience. Maybe they did realize how poorly they treated you during your big announcement and wanted to make up for it. Is that suddenly illegal or wrong to do? Isn't that like an apology? They realized what they did wrong.\n\nSince you like overthinking things, let me give you another scenario to think about. Maybe they didn't invite your family for various reasons. They might not have had their contact info or wanted to overstep and take away the planning from your family. In this case, your friends get to do something special for you and your family does too.\n\nThe whole circle of friends seems like a mess between your general crappy mentality and them criticizing you for being too young to be pregnant.

I know some lady who ended up with 4: one her mom threw for her family, one her MIL threw for her husband's family and friends, us friends threw her a small private one with just us, and her colleagues threw a small surprise party with gifts at her office. Her husband even had some sorta diaper and drinks party his friends threw.", "YTA....You sound immature and not ready for adulthood let alone motherhood.  People have multiple showers all the time.

It sounds like your friends worked really hard to be excited for you and you acted like a brat (maybe you are too young\u2026).

The baby shower was their \"gift\"", "Why did they invite strangers then?", "The party was for them and their friends, some not even terribly familiar with the OP. Perhaps if I had agreed with your opinion, you would have been better able to understand my response?", "I wouldn\u2019t accept anything from someone or someones who could not apologize to me outright. Don\u2019t sugar coat it under gifts and surprises. The same way they questioned her outright, they can apologize outright. She said they were already distant with each other and she went as a chance to get closer. They aren\u2019t close enough to her anymore at this point to celebrate a baby they told her not to have. They aren\u2019t close enough to her to tell strangers about her baby. It\u2019s very \u201cwe threw you a party so forgive us.\u201d They had several days if not weeks to be like \u201chey, actually, we are excited for you. We were just concerned\u201d and then throw the party afterwards. I\u2019d be hesitant to celebrate with people who said I shouldn\u2019t have my baby and the man I\u2019m having it with is trash.", "Thats just ridiculous, is this a country by country thing? Why would you even attend a baby shower for someone you don't know", "YTA op I\u2019m nervous for op to experience being a new mom because life is far from perfect. I\u2019m sure OP\u2019s friends were just listing obvious concerns and op got upset they didn\u2019t fit into her fantasy world. Just a heads up, OP, you\u2019re gonna need a lot of support when you\u2019re a new mom and burning all your friendships now is not the best plan. You should apologize and hope they accept it.", "She also dreamed up their responses to the cake announcement and was so disappointed, that she thought they owed her apologies for their (rightful) concerns. I'm already worried for the fetus.", "You\u2019re not TWENTY FOUR.", "Her living situation isn\u2019t unstable. Shes been with her partner for 2 years and he owns the home. Not every couple wants to be married, and having the government have control over your relationship doesn\u2019t make it a better one for a child to be born. Plus, if the parents break up, there is less trauma from the divorce process, and only a custody battle. The father can be on the birth certificate if he signs an acknowledgment of paternity, or can be added later on, whenever. \n\nA marriage certificate does not guarantee a baby will have a better life.", "I had the same reaction when my sister announced hers and she was in her 30s. But we talked about it like adults and she had a back up plan in case the father bailed on her or other events happened. (unmarried and guy had other kids with other women, wasn't paying child support on one of them, let his drug addicted wife keep the other AGAINST court orders.)", "Very well said. \ud83d\udc4f", "Tbf, there are valid reasons for saying people should get married before having kids. Marriage offers legal protections that you don't get if you're just dating the person. And ultimately if you're not committed enough to get married, then are you really committed enough to raise a child together?", "The marriage part isn't as essential I think. The friends seemed more concerned with OP being on the younger side and it doesn't seem like they like the boyfriend all that much.", "\"Don't they understand how *hard* it is to be a mom when you're 24?\"", "Yep yep yep. I want to be a parent with my partner - not because I want to play with a baby, or a toddler, but because I want to raise a *person* with their *own* ideas, beliefs, etc.. I'm so excited to have a kid, a preteen, a teenager... and I'm excited for them to fight me on things, I'm excited for them to advocate for themselves and I want to teach them HOW to do that.\n\nOf course, though, I am going in to teach teenagers, so I may be biased towards teens, haha. It's my favorite developmental period in larval humans.", "What about when their birthplace doesn't go the way they envisioned.. goodness", "She says on her comments on the 5 months they haven't reached out about the pregnancy, no apology, no effort of support for 5 months. Then she's just supposed to be happy that they've finally supported her? In a way she didn't want, which they would have known if they'd bothered to be good friends", "Literally the next day would be fine, just not the second she announces it. No need to ruin that moment for her, shes never getting it back.", "Idk maybe never? Like a friends pregnancy is none of your business and unless they ask for advice don\u2019t offer it", "never - she's pregnant and happy about it - people have babies at different ages\nthrowing concerns at a pregnant woman who is thrilled about having a baby at that point in her life is not going to do much for keeping that friendship", "What good does addressing concerns do tho? Especially if the friend came out with the news with excitement. Op even came out with a cake to announce. I think op handled the baby shower wrong, but she's gonna learn the stresses of a child soon enough anyway.", "If they had tried to make up for it the next day or week I might be inclined to agree, but according to OPs comments it was 5 months", "You can have more than 1 shower, lol.\n\nShe'll be on the mommy subs soon enough because she's so lonely without friends.", "I could be wrong because i don't know this commentary,  but I think the person who asked if OP expects Baby to strengthen the relationship probably shares your views. \n\nPlenty of people get pregnant thinking of will help the relationship and need someone to point out they're wrong", "They still didn't bother her entire pregnancy and she's just supposed to be okay with that.", "All I'm seeing is more whining.", "Well I guess you'd also be the AH.", "Nonsense. I trust this as much as all your other responses.", "So you\u2019re saying that not a single person at this party brought anything for you? Did you even stay long enough to confirm that?", "??? The point of a baby shower is to bring gifts. If there are no gifts, it's not a baby shower.", "Cap", "So it was a party and not a shower. No wonder your family wasn't invited.", "Add as info! That\u2019s kinda a HUGE missing detail.", "They weren\u2019t strangers. OP knew those other people.", "OP didn\u2019t even stay long enough to see if there would be an apology. Besides she said she was overjoyed by her gesture at first. She only walked out when she saw that her family wasn\u2019t there. If the friends had thrown OP her dream shower, she probably would have stayed for the whole thing.", ">Why would you even attend a baby shower for someone you don't know?\n\nI had a few people at my baby shower that I didn't really know, but they were close friends with my Mom, so they wanted to be part of my Mom becoming a grandma I guess.  (plus ladies in \"grandma\" stage often LOVE shopping for and making cute baby things).", "You have nearly as bad Main Character Syndrome as OP. Your experience does not define the norm and things that differ from your experience are not immediately \"ridiculous\".", "Yup. Also, all her friends hate her boyfriend? That\u2019s usually a red flag.", "Rude much", "youre right, im 21.", "\"Government have control over your relationship\"\n\nDo you even understand what marriage is and what it can provide lmao.", "I did say debatably unstable. I debate its stability because she does not own it and she's not on a lease. If they break up, she can be kicked out. Sure, there are local laws that might briefly protect her, but she'll have very little notice and she has to hope she doesn't have to fight for her rights. She could be homeless while fighting for her 30 or 60 day eviction notice from her boyfriend, for instance.\n\nIt sounds like her boyfriend is able to parent, so hopefully that's something he desires. He does have that financial stability and housing stability. But *she* doesn't have it. She's relying on him without any legal protections.", "My partner and I have been together for a decade and have a kid together. We will never be married because marriage is meaningless.", "I agree with you and with your assessment, I meant that Reddit is obsessed with people not having kids outside of marriage - not her friends. But I do think you're spot on about what OP's friends think", "Ah yes, classic case of an OPs comments changing the story after the votes are calling her an AH \ud83d\ude02", "She's said she's even hung out with some of them individually in the time between. One on one.", "People typically announce they\u2019re expecting at different times to different people (close friends and family first, and radiating socially outward from there), so she\u2019ll certainly have several announcement moments.", "Tbf likeeeee\nI hate baby showers. I've never had one and I find them weird \ud83e\udd23 (I'm a mom of 2) \n\nThe fact that her friends were perceptive enough to know she'd want a baby shower, and gave her one and bc it didn't meet her standards, she flipped out and left LAWD idk why she isn't embarrassed and I really hope this is fake", "Agreed I think they phrased it to force OP to admit that she sees this baby as like a cure all", "OP also says in the post that they maintained contact over the months after the announcement. I\u2019m pregnant with my second. I have 1-2 friends that I regularly talk to about my pregnancy, but otherwise, it\u2019s bizarre to expect everyone around you to be constantly invested in *your* life event that they can\u2019t relate to in any way.", "Great response, really intelligent there", "I'd gladly be the asshole", "I think she\u2019s trying to save face at this point. There\u2019s no shot they decorated and everything if they didn\u2019t have presents", "Don\u2019t do public apologies just like you don\u2019t do public proposals. It\u2019s manipulative and used as a tactic to force people to agree to something they may otherwise not. They treated her wrong, but now she\u2019s the rude one for leaving. She\u2019s not required to stay anywhere she doesn\u2019t want to be. People are allowed to leave a situation they don\u2019t want to be in, especially surprises. Them spending money does not entitle them to her time and attention. Them spending money does not mean she\u2019s required to stay. Them spending money doesn\u2019t mean she has to be grateful or to hear them out. The same way telling someone a bad partner spent money on a gift so be appreciative and stay, is bad form. Telling someone they need to stay around bad friends because they threw her a party, is also bad form. And if they can tell her business to strangers and invite them to a baby shower for a baby they don\u2019t think she should have, they can go the extra mile and tell her family. Anyone saying she must stay because they spent money are just as rude as her friends and just as manipulative. I don\u2019t care if they spent a million dollars on the party, she doesn\u2019t have to stay. \n\nThis is like the story where the man threw the surprise wedding for his fianc\u00e9e. People told her to stay because he spent money and planned a great party, and her family was there. She left. Doesn\u2019t matter he threw her a party, she\u2019s allowed to leave. It\u2019s a risk you run when throwing surprises. Money doesn\u2019t solve anything and it doesn\u2019t mean she has to stay. \nAlso, my comment says apologize or make amends BEFORE throwing the party, not at the party.", "I suppose I can understand the mums friends aspect, but in this case none of her family where involved so it was just straight up strangers", "Just from the tone of her post, it feels like the boyfriend is an afterthought anyway. She wants a baby, regardless of who it's with.", "Yep", "And been trying for years?", "Ok but legally that is not true. Like I'm not saying it should have personal meaning *to you*, but legally marriage affects all kinds of things. Glad it's worked out for you and your partner but that's not always the case", "Imagine that, there's more to a story than just the short snapshot someone can get into the character limit", "If things weren\u2019t cool between them, why did OP accept their invitation to a Christmas party? Why are you overlooking the fact that OP was overjoyed by that gesture until she saw that her family wasn\u2019t there? She\u2019s not upset that they threw her a shower. She\u2019s upset that it wasn\u2019t her dream shower.", "actually, yes. Ive had PCOS since i was 13, started ttc with a bf when i was 16. started trying with my now husband at 18, 3 and a half years later, still no baby.", "Where I live, being married is legally indistinguishable from commonlaw. It's a reach to say \"you're not committed enough to be married so you're not committed enough to have kids together\". Are there other red flags about OP's situation? Absolutely. Being unmarried isn't one of them.", "Or they could've just said what happened instead of \"we kept in contact\"", "Her question was is she rude for leaving. The answer is no. If you\u2019re going to NOT apologize and throw a surprise party, you better make it grand and the party of my dreams. Especially after telling me not to have my baby. She\u2019s allowed to leave for whatever reason she wants. Them spending money and throwing a party is irrelevant. It\u2019s a risk you run throwing surprise anything. She can leave whenever and for whatever reason.\n\nShe also said she accepted in hopes of them making amends for what happened. That sounds like a casual hangout with the opportunity to talk things out. Don\u2019t throw a baby shower for a baby you told her she shouldn\u2019t have. If you\u2019re going to invite people unrelated to what happened, they should invite her family.", "\u2026yikes. Why were you TTC at 16", "because i was in an abusive relationship. I only mention it as part of my Ttc journey bc i was tracking ovulation, taking pregnancy tests, etc."]}
