You are in fact not a terrible brother, they should be ashamed of themselves. Good job cutting contact with sister.", "NTA. I wish people stopped acting like having a romantic partner is some fundamental life requirement instead of a personal choice. If you don't want to date, you don't have to, regardless of your reasons, and people nagging you about it are the assholes. Your response to your sister was a bit rude but so was her getting angry at you for your personal choice that doesn't affect her at all. Maybe you can have a calmer conversation with her and explain that you don't appreciate those comments and if she keeps doing that, you will not want to spend time with her.", "NTA. If this was your reaction the first time she mentioned someone else, ok. Might be a bit much. But it has been years now of people not listening to your needs or respecting your wishes. You have expressed your feelings, your family is choosing to ignore them, and they are disrespecting your boundaries. If you were locked in your room and not functioning, I could see them intervening. But sounds like you are living your life, you have gotten help, you know what you do and do not want. Seems like yelling is the only option you had. I really hope they get with the program OP and back off. No one should be this consistently harassed to do something they have no desire to do.", "NTA, you're free to live your life as you see fit, and others should not interfere and try to push you into something you don't want, especially after you've told them you're not interested.", "NTA. OP, you are not a terrible brother for this. Your sister and family have been actively disrespecting your boundaries for years in frankly disgusting ways. Romantic love is not the only kind of love and it is not required for a happy life. But more importantly, it's literally none of your family's business if you ever date again or not. They do not get to have a say in that and this behavior of theirs is absolutely atrocious.

WTF is wrong with people?? They sound horrible to be honest. People need to realize that not everyone wants to date and moving on doesn't mean moving on to someone else every time.

I understand the concept of being done. You have the right to choose how you live.", "NTA \n\nFirstly, I am sorry for your loss. Secondly, you don't want to move on, fine. People insulting you, trying to push you to date again is an AH move. It's disgusting behavior in my honest opinion.", "NTA, you have every right to not have a partner again. It is your choice not to date, similar to someone who chooses to date after the death of a spouse. It doesn\u2019t mean you are not \u201cliving life\u201d, whatever that means. People need to respect other\u2019s choices.", "NTA your sister and your family need to respect you, and your boundaries.

People are not helping by trying to force this on you. Good luck, hour nta", "NTA.\n\nIts your choice.\n\nWhile at the same time I see things from your sisters point of view. She might genuinely believe that a person can't be \"complete' without a partner. She loves you and probably imagines you lonely and pinning away...\n\nBut stand firm OP. It will eventually, hopefully, get through to them that you are okay on your own.", "NTA but dont stay alone to honor your wife's memory.  I loved my mother dearly and my dad saw her through cancer. I never wanted him to be alone forever and he's dating again. I just want him to be happy.", "NTA, even if refusing finding a partner at 28 years old of age is a bad decision, it's still 100% your decision and any consequences arising from it will be only yours to bear, so no else has the right to criticize you..", "NAH. You never have to date again if you don't want to, but I do think it's more likely that you're mired in grief than anything, and the people around you are right to be concerned.", "NAH. Your family cares about you. They don't _understand_ you, but they care. They think they are helping, but they are being too pushy and taking it too far. You let your sister know in no uncertain terms that she crossed the line. You know you went too far with your response, but it was the heat of the moment.\n\nBTW, you're the opposite of an incel. An incel is someone who believes life is not worth living without a romantic partner but can't get or keep one. You believe life is worth living without one and choose not to.", "NTA.  If you are a young man in a Western country, it's better not to date, actually.  Like, not even smash and dash.  You did NOT go too far in dealing with your sister.  Your family needs to learn to butt OUT or you are better going no contact with them anyway.  You'll be happier without a female to complicate your life.  \n\nBefore someone gets smart... I have a girlfriend and the two of us are very happy with each other.  But that's my choice, and if all I had access to were Western women, I WOULD BE MUCH HAPPIER TO NOT BE DATING AT ALL.\n\nThe average Western man gains nothing by dating a Western woman.  Nothing at all.  Sex?  Not worth the price.  One night stand?  OK.  But choosing not to even smash and dash is a valid choice, too.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It may be one year it may be 10 years it may be never.  \n\nThere is a lot more to life than looking for romantic love.  If others don't see that then for them I feel sorry.", "NTA for wanting to live your life as you choose and to have that choice be respected. \n\nI can understand your decision to not be with anyone else, especially in the circumstances of losing the love of your life. \n\nI can also see the perspective of your family, who undoubtedly saw just how happy and complete you were and who see that a part of you left with your wife - a small part of which that they may hope can some day come back. That doesn't excuse their behaviour or lack of respect for your life choices.\n\nGrief and loss is something everyone deals with differently and that journey should be supported. At the same time, you could also consider that those closest to you have not only been grieving the total loss of your wife, but also the loss of who you were when she was still here. They are now doing what they they think is best (however misguided and frustrating) to \"get you back\". You respond by (in their eyes) \"digging your heels in\" and angry confrontations happen.\n\nIf you haven't already done so, maybe suggest a family (bereavement) counselling session to talk through the changes in your life/ lives since you lost your wife. This would allow you to make clear once and for all that when they make these comments, suggestions, or introductions, it is distressing and disrespectful.

More often than not those people think they have the right to have a say in your life because they love you.\nThe truth is they only love you so long as you conform to their expectations. I don't blame OP, either. I would've done the same a long time ago.", "I gave you a downvote as you totally  missed the point.  OP dealt with his grief a long time ago.  He's in his best frame of mind NOW.  Part of that is that he has chosen to remain single.  This is not dealing with grief, it is living life to the fullest long after the grief has been fully processed!\n\nYou assuming his choice to remain single is related to grief makes you as bad as his relatives, who also \"don't get it\".  He's where he's at as that is where he chose to be.", "Why is that a bad decision? And what consequences could come from that?", "I can't believe I am going to be stupid enough to do this .. but elaborate on what your issue with western women is ?", "Obviously it's my subjective opinion, not an objective fact, but all the research on human happiness clearly points to the fact that close relationships are the thing that contributes the most to the general happiness, so deciding to not pursue any partner for the majority of youth, is most likely a bad decision, no matter the reasons, because unless there is a very specific reason, just shutting oneself and focusing on memories of a deceased person instead of actually trying to move on with life will lead to regrets down the line... \n\nWe have just one life and it's too short to not enjoy it.", "If you need me to answer that question, I'd have to conclude that you've been out of the dating market completely the last 30 years or so.\n\nThere are good Western women out there.   But trying to find one is like searching for a needle in a whole field full of needle stacks.  At best, you're going to get injured a lot just to make the effort...\n\nThe irony is that Western men who drop out of the dating market completely are insulted, ridiculed and labeled as incels.  But that's like seeing a guy who chooses not to eat at McDonald's and criticizing him as being a vegan....\n\n(if you don't like your choices, not making a choice is also a valid choice...and does not imply in any way that there is something wrong  with you...)", "I get that some people think that way, but I know a lot of people including myself who are way unhappier in relationships and truly better off single. I was married and divorced, tried dating around after, short term, long term, FWB, all of it. Never happier than being single. And it's not like I sit here doing nothing and am bored and sad because I don't have someone lol I live a great life! I legit wouldn't have time for a partner even if I wanted one. So your line of just having one life and it being too short to not enjoy it is silly because people can easily enjoy their lives without having a partner. \n\nI'm not saying there's a right way or a wrong way, just that this idea of relationship=happiness isn't always true for a lot of people.", "No , I'm a western woman , with a partner , who has just bought our house last year .

Wanting a career and life of their own ?", "As a \"western man\", I believe your choice of action (not dating) is valid, good for you.

Sorry you got cheated on, but that doesn't change your bias into reality.\n\nThat's just it though....I had a bias BEFORE I got hit with reality!!!  Luckily, I don't have that problem anymore.  And me and my much younger girlfriend are both very happy.  I've learned to take control of the relationship like the man should.  She responds well to my masculine energy.  She is happy to join me on my journey.\n\nIt's not for everyone.  That's ok.  The rest of the universe can have multiple partners on the sly and deal with the constant drama.  I'm over it.  I've got a girl who's crazy in love with me and I do trust her.  Until she chooses to not be with me anymore, by doing something she knows is a deal-breaker.  Her choice.  Always her choice.\n\nAnd if she chooses to stay with me?  It would be pretty fucking arrogant for anybody on reddit to presume to tell her she made the wrong choice.  If you ask her, she'd say she's happy with me.  Whether I can hear her answer, or not.\n\nYour comment from before . I get it now . Control of a relationship , younger spouse , masculine energy \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02.

You are allowed to find joy and happiness. Your joy and happiness do not need to come from another partner. It is okay if it does. And it is very very very okay if it doesn't. The important piece in understanding grief, is that you can still partake in life. The grief doesn't leave. It doesn't hurt less.  You make room for it. You grow the muscles needed to hold it so it doesn't consume you. \n\nI'm so sorry for your experience with grief counselors. We know grief isn't linear and everyone moves in different ways through their grief. \n\nPerhaps your sister is fearful of you being stuck.

Don\u2019t get angry, don\u2019t justify your feelings, don\u2019t leave room for argument.   \n\nFamily/Friends:   I appreciate and understand your concern for me.   I took the death of wife hard but over the past few years have healed and have lived what I feel is a life.   I am content with my work and friend network.  I have hobbies and interact with people on a consistent basis . While at this time I am not interested in pursuing a romantic relationship, that does not mean in the future I won\u2019t change my mind.    Your insistence that \u201cyou know what is best\u201d and your consistent name calling has caused me to re-evaluate my relationship with you and your true feelings for me.  That being said, if you cannot support me by being a friend/relative, then I respectfully ask that you stop contacting me. You do not know what is best for me and I would appreciate you realizing that I am an adult and can make my own decisions without input I have not asked for.   If you cannot respect me then please walk away\u201d\n\nYes, this is going to cause you to have family members get more angry and may cause some people to say fine FU if that is the way you want to be, but honestly?   Do you need them in your life?   If they care, they will reflect and while they probably won\u2019t 100% stop, they will probably at least lay off for a bit.  If they only ramp it up, then they are toxic and you should probably remove them from your life anyway.  \n\nYou were not wrong to yell at your sister and say what you did.   I will also say that sometimes, getting very quiet and speaking with a very soft voice works wonders.   People will tune out yelling, or they are immune, or their defensive mechanism goes up so there is reasoning with them.  When you take a deep breath, soften your voice and then say what you need to say, they have to listen hard in order to hear you, they don\u2019t always know how to respond, but they do eventually.    The shouting match doesn\u2019t happen.", "NAH. Dude they're right, it isn't normal to decide that you'll be single forever after only one adult relationship. It isn't healthy. You have mental health professionals telling you as much.

People get weird about death. \n\nThere are many widows/widowers like you, who don't get romatically involved again or wait a long time to do it.\n\nThere are widowers like me, who get married again.\n\nSo you should lead your life as you want, unless you find yourself being disfunctional in other ways.

It just means listening with good faith, openly, from a position willing to hear them rather than immediately conjuring arguments why you can\u2019t/won\u2019t/shouldn\u2019t have to. You need to do that for your own sake. Not anyone else\u2019s, not your deceased wife\u2019s.

They perceive you choosing to be single as you still grieving, and they think that if you date someone else, that will signal that you have healed. It may be worth having a conversation with them where you explain that you are doing ok, you have seen doctors and therapists, and you are simply choosing to be single as that is how you are currently happiest, rather than linking it specifically to your late wife. As toxic as their behavior is, it is probably rooted in them wanting you to be happy. If you can de-couple the idea of you dating again to the idea of you being happy, they will probably calm tf down. That being said, you certainly do not OWE them an explanation, and they do owe you basic respect for your boundaries.

Unless you used your lost as an excuse to give up on life entirely and rely on the family, otherwise you aren\u2019t TA but they are.\n\nRomantic relationship and marriage is a personal matter over which your family should have no right to control.

My Grandpa A died very unexpectedly at a young age from an aggressive form of cancer that came with 5% survival rate because it had already metastasized, leaving my grandma a widow with several young children. She was absolutely devastated emotionally as it almost came from nowhere; Grandpa A went to the doctor for a simple issue that within 3 weeks came back with a terminal diagnosis. How she found the emotional strength to soldier through to work (she very luckily had gotten her education and kept working after she married) and take care of the kids is something that blows my mind away, even though so many single parents do.
