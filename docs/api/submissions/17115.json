I told her that I was in fact living my life, and she needs to stay out of it. Where I may have went too far is when I told her I lost my wife, I can survive without a sister just fine, and that's what I'll be doing until she apologizes and backs off.

That hardly applies when the celibacy is very much voluntary right?", "NTA. \n\n>I told her I lost my wife, I can survive without a sister just fine, and that's what I'll be doing until she apologizes and backs off.\n\nAbsolutely right. Anyone who tells you what to do, how to feel or how to live your life should get the same treatment.", "NTA - why are people so invested in your love life? That's sounds pretty unhealthy. Implying your not \"complete\" unless in a relationship translate a pretty poor image of themselves imo. If you're happy like that, then it was time you'd put your foot down. Your sister stepped on your boundaries for years, hence the ultimatum (stop harassing you or get out of your life).", "NTA. Its none of their business but they still decide to be AH over it. You are in fact not a terrible brother, they should be ashamed of themselves. Good job cutting contact with sister.", "NTA. I wish people stopped acting like having a romantic partner is some fundamental life requirement instead of a personal choice. If you don't want to date, you don't have to, regardless of your reasons, and people nagging you about it are the assholes. Your response to your sister was a bit rude but so was her getting angry at you for your personal choice that doesn't affect her at all. Maybe you can have a calmer conversation with her and explain that you don't appreciate those comments and if she keeps doing that, you will not want to spend time with her.", "NTA. If this was your reaction the first time she mentioned someone else, ok. Might be a bit much. But it has been years now of people not listening to your needs or respecting your wishes. You have expressed your feelings, your family is choosing to ignore them, and they are disrespecting your boundaries. If you were locked in your room and not functioning, I could see them intervening. But sounds like you are living your life, you have gotten help, you know what you do and do not want. Seems like yelling is the only option you had. I really hope they get with the program OP and back off. No one should be this consistently harassed to do something they have no desire to do.", "NTA, you're free to live your life as you see fit, and others should not interfere and try to push you into something you don't want, especially after you've told them you're not interested.", "NTA. OP, you are not a terrible brother for this. Your sister and family have been actively disrespecting your boundaries for years in frankly disgusting ways. Romantic love is not the only kind of love and it is not required for a happy life. But more importantly, it's literally none of your family's business if you ever date again or not. They do not get to have a say in that and this behavior of theirs is absolutely atrocious. Good on you for telling your sister off.", "NTA\n\nI'll never understand why some people truly believe others can't be happy if their not in a relationship with someone. Your dating life (or lack there of) should be no one's business but your own. \n\nYou lost your wife and if you choose to never date again then I don't see how that impacts anyone in your family or friend circle negatively.\n\nLive your life and enjoy it how YOU want to; its no one's life but yours.", "NTA. \nWhy are you even talking to these people?", "NTA. WTF is wrong with people?? They sound horrible to be honest. People need to realize that not everyone wants to date and moving on doesn't mean moving on to someone else every time. I love how when a man decides to stay single he becomes an incel too. I got this a lot when I decided to stop dating, and I ended up snapping too, it was the only way to get my point across to people. Now people have just accepted it, but it took a while. I'm amazed you didn't snap sooner and people like her need to hear those things.", "NTA. You don\u2019t want to date and there\u2019s nothing wrong with that, even if you hadn\u2019t experienced such a terrible loss. Clearly the calm polite communications have not worked, so you had to escalate.", "NTA. Perfectly acceptable reaction from you, I believe.", "NTA. Keep on doing what is best for you & hold your head high.", "NTA. I\u2019m a widow who lost my partner at 23. We\u2019d also been dating since high school. While I have had dalliances and even some short-term romances in the (whew\u2026) almost two decades since, I\u2019ll never remarry and I\u2019ve never been in the type of love I\u2019d want to have to even chance it. So, I get it. \n\nMy life otherwise is so incredibly full. I have amazing friends, I love where I live, my job is great, I get to travel a lot. The world causes me intense anger and pain because fascism and poverty (among other things) exist, but\u2026 I\u2019m living a great life\u2014alone.", "NTA\n\nShe kept digging and digging at it. I can\u2019t blame you for snapping. I hate how people think they know what\u2019s best for you. You do you man.", "NTA. You don\u2019t want to date and there\u2019s nothing wrong with that, even if you hadn\u2019t experienced such a terrible loss. Clearly the calm polite communications have not worked, so you had to escalate.", "NTA -   WOW.  They should get a life and stop meddling in yours.  \nAre they THAT bored?", "NTA\n\nYou can move on without a new partner.", "Info: they call you an incel. But that would be involuntary. That is the whole thing. You don\u2019t want to date. Are they just not aware of the words meaning or are you doing anything else that might suggest you not being alright aside from not dating? Like putting people down or anything?", "NTA. Block all of them. You dont deserve to be treated that way. If you are happy why do they care?", "Sooo NTA. And I\u2019m sorry for your loss\n\nYou want to make a person miserable? Force them into intimate relationships they don\u2019t want. \n\nYour family is insane. It\u2019s okay ti want to be a bachelor. It\u2019s okay to feel like you\u2019ll never marry again.\n\nI would say that it *is* important to \u201cmove on\u201d- I hate that phrase\u2026- cherish the good memories, but you can\u2019t not live life\u2026. that life doesn\u2019t have to include a new spouse, and that\u2019s a decision that is solely up to you,", "NTA, you don't have to have a partner if you are content. I've been with my partner for 22 years since I was 17. If something happened I would be done. I had the love of my life and no one should have to try to follow that. I understand the concept of being done. You have the right to choose how you live.", "NTA \n\nFirstly, I am sorry for your loss. Secondly, you don't want to move on, fine. People insulting you, trying to push you to date again is an AH move. It's disgusting behavior in my honest opinion.", "NTA, you have every right to not have a partner again. It is your choice not to date, similar to someone who chooses to date after the death of a spouse. It doesn\u2019t mean you are not \u201cliving life\u201d, whatever that means. People need to respect other\u2019s choices.", "NTA your sister and your family need to respect you, and your boundaries. You cannot tell anyone how to feel or act, cruel as it sounds, maybe this will make her nack off. I understand your point, people handle grief differently, right now you can't see away ahead. People are not helping by trying to force this on you. Good luck, hour nta", "NTA.\n\nIts your choice.\n\nWhile at the same time I see things from your sisters point of view. She might genuinely believe that a person can't be \"complete' without a partner. She loves you and probably imagines you lonely and pinning away...\n\nBut stand firm OP. It will eventually, hopefully, get through to them that you are okay on your own.", "NTA but dont stay alone to honor your wife's memory.  I loved my mother dearly and my dad saw her through cancer. I never wanted him to be alone forever and he's dating again. I just want him to be happy.", "NTA, even if refusing finding a partner at 28 years old of age is a bad decision, it's still 100% your decision and any consequences arising from it will be only yours to bear, so no else has the right to criticize you..", "NAH. You never have to date again if you don't want to, but I do think it's more likely that you're mired in grief than anything, and the people around you are right to be concerned.", "NAH. Your family cares about you. They don't _understand_ you, but they care. They think they are helping, but they are being too pushy and taking it too far. You let your sister know in no uncertain terms that she crossed the line. You know you went too far with your response, but it was the heat of the moment.\n\nBTW, you're the opposite of an incel. An incel is someone who believes life is not worth living without a romantic partner but can't get or keep one. You believe life is worth living without one and choose not to.", "NTA.  If you are a young man in a Western country, it's better not to date, actually.  Like, not even smash and dash.  You did NOT go too far in dealing with your sister.  Your family needs to learn to butt OUT or you are better going no contact with them anyway.  You'll be happier without a female to complicate your life.  \n\nBefore someone gets smart... I have a girlfriend and the two of us are very happy with each other.  But that's my choice, and if all I had access to were Western women, I WOULD BE MUCH HAPPIER TO NOT BE DATING AT ALL.\n\nThe average Western man gains nothing by dating a Western woman.  Nothing at all.  Sex?  Not worth the price.  One night stand?  OK.  But choosing not to even smash and dash is a valid choice, too.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It may be one year it may be 10 years it may be never.  \n\nThere is a lot more to life than looking for romantic love.  If others don't see that then for them I feel sorry.", "NTA for wanting to live your life as you choose and to have that choice be respected. \n\nI can understand your decision to not be with anyone else, especially in the circumstances of losing the love of your life. \n\nI can also see the perspective of your family, who undoubtedly saw just how happy and complete you were and who see that a part of you left with your wife - a small part of which that they may hope can some day come back. That doesn't excuse their behaviour or lack of respect for your life choices.\n\nGrief and loss is something everyone deals with differently and that journey should be supported. At the same time, you could also consider that those closest to you have not only been grieving the total loss of your wife, but also the loss of who you were when she was still here. They are now doing what they they think is best (however misguided and frustrating) to \"get you back\". You respond by (in their eyes) \"digging your heels in\" and angry confrontations happen.\n\nIf you haven't already done so, maybe suggest a family (bereavement) counselling session to talk through the changes in your life/ lives since you lost your wife. This would allow you to make clear once and for all that when they make these comments, suggestions, or introductions, it is distressing and disrespectful. A cheaper alternative would be to write a letter to those you want to get the message across so they can't argue back! \n\nBest wishes for finding peace and your happiness \ud83d\ude42", "NTA OP.  Your sister, though?  \ud83d\udcafTA, and if your family keeps it up, you should go no contact with them until they apologize.", "People like to throw that word around whenever they can.

Funny thing is I dropped those people out of my life like hot potatoes, and they somehow wondered why \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f", "Yeah. More often than not those people think they have the right to have a say in your life because they love you.\nThe truth is they only love you so long as you conform to their expectations. I don't blame OP, either. I would've done the same a long time ago.", "I gave you a downvote as you totally  missed the point.  OP dealt with his grief a long time ago.  He's in his best frame of mind NOW.  Part of that is that he has chosen to remain single.  This is not dealing with grief, it is living life to the fullest long after the grief has been fully processed!\n\nYou assuming his choice to remain single is related to grief makes you as bad as his relatives, who also \"don't get it\".  He's where he's at as that is where he chose to be.", "Why is that a bad decision? And what consequences could come from that?", "I can't believe I am going to be stupid enough to do this .. but elaborate on what your issue with western women is ?", "Obviously it's my subjective opinion, not an objective fact, but all the research on human happiness clearly points to the fact that close relationships are the thing that contributes the most to the general happiness, so deciding to not pursue any partner for the majority of youth, is most likely a bad decision, no matter the reasons, because unless there is a very specific reason, just shutting oneself and focusing on memories of a deceased person instead of actually trying to move on with life will lead to regrets down the line... \n\nWe have just one life and it's too short to not enjoy it.", "If you need me to answer that question, I'd have to conclude that you've been out of the dating market completely the last 30 years or so.\n\nThere are good Western women out there.   But trying to find one is like searching for a needle in a whole field full of needle stacks.  At best, you're going to get injured a lot just to make the effort...\n\nThe irony is that Western men who drop out of the dating market completely are insulted, ridiculed and labeled as incels.  But that's like seeing a guy who chooses not to eat at McDonald's and criticizing him as being a vegan....\n\n(if you don't like your choices, not making a choice is also a valid choice...and does not imply in any way that there is something wrong  with you...)", "I get that some people think that way, but I know a lot of people including myself who are way unhappier in relationships and truly better off single. I was married and divorced, tried dating around after, short term, long term, FWB, all of it. Never happier than being single. And it's not like I sit here doing nothing and am bored and sad because I don't have someone lol I live a great life! I legit wouldn't have time for a partner even if I wanted one. So your line of just having one life and it being too short to not enjoy it is silly because people can easily enjoy their lives without having a partner. \n\nI'm not saying there's a right way or a wrong way, just that this idea of relationship=happiness isn't always true for a lot of people.", "No , I'm a western woman , with a partner , who has just bought our house last year . So ... What's your issue ? Not doing what you say at all the time ? Wanting a career and life of their own ?", "As a \"western man\", I believe your choice of action (not dating) is valid, good for you. But your generalizations of western men and women are not recognizable, you may be a western man, but your view of the mean/common western man/woman  is severely clouded by your individual experience.", "The problem is not \"now\" but \"later\".  \n\nFor any long-term scenario (especially marriage) a Western guy assumes 100% of the risk and 0% of the reward.\n\nWhen it dissolves (and it will) who comes out OK?", "That's interesting . Can you explain how you've come to that conclusion ?", ">girls-only means girls-only. Sorry you got cheated on, but that doesn't change your bias into reality.\n\nThat's just it though....I had a bias BEFORE I got hit with reality!!!  Luckily, I don't have that problem anymore.  And me and my much younger girlfriend are both very happy.  I've learned to take control of the relationship like the man should.  She responds well to my masculine energy.  She is happy to join me on my journey.\n\nIt's not for everyone.  That's ok.  The rest of the universe can have multiple partners on the sly and deal with the constant drama.  I'm over it.  I've got a girl who's crazy in love with me and I do trust her.  Until she chooses to not be with me anymore, by doing something she knows is a deal-breaker.  Her choice.  Always her choice.\n\nAnd if she chooses to stay with me?  It would be pretty fucking arrogant for anybody on reddit to presume to tell her she made the wrong choice.  If you ask her, she'd say she's happy with me.  Whether I can hear her answer, or not.\n\nYour comment from before . I get it now . Control of a relationship , younger spouse , masculine energy \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02. You are the type of person who sees your partner as someone to be controlled , most women your own age are going to see through your bullshit so you have had to go for someone young who isn't mature enough to see you for who you are ."]}
