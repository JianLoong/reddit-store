{"id": 13372, "submission_id": "124b76r", "title": "AITA for making my son my beneficiary?", "selftext": " \n\nFirst some history. I was raised by a single Mom. When I was still very little, she took out a life insurance policy on me. Eventually, she paid the policy in full and its been just sitting there drawing interest for most of my life.\n\nIn 1999, I married a man who had been previously married and had 2 kids. I will call them Mike and Jack for this post. Mike and Jack lived with us. Their Mom was not a stable home for them. On several occasions she ran up bills putting her name with our address and phone number. We got calls from bill collectors and would then have to explain to them that she did not live with us and had never lived at this address. She was my husbands ex-wife for several years, and he was not responsible for her bill. So obviously my opinion of her was never that great. Four years after we married we had a son of our own, Kent.\n\nIn 2020, we lost my Mom to a heart condition. After the funeral, we went through her papers. I found the papers for my life insurance policy. Honestly, I had almost forgotten about the thing. For years it had just sat there, and she had taken care of any thing relating to it.\n\nI saw that she was the beneficiary and I knew I had to change that. My obvious first thought was my husband. However, this policy was taken out by my Mom and paid in full by her. I feel like I have to consider what she would want as well. My youngest son, Kent, is in his first year of college. I feel like she would want that money to go to him, her Grandson. To help him get a start in life and to pay off his student loans, and maybe make a down payment on a home or something. I also considered that if anything happens to me and all the money goes to my husband, then something happens to him; if he doesn't have a will stating that the insurance money goes to my son, that money would then be split between his three sons. I'm sorry but I do NOT want any of that money making its way to his ex-wife even if its through his sons. (Mike now lives with her)\n\nI decided that I would make Kent my beneficiary. I would also put in my will that he is to use the insurance money to pay for my final expenses, and to help his father with any bills that are left after I'm gone. That the rest is for him to use as he sees fit. Pay off loans, bills, etc whatever he thinks will help him get ahead in life.\n\nMy husband found out that I made Kent the beneficiary and got upset about it. We're not \"fighting\" about it, but I can feel he's not happy with me. He says that I'm the beneficiary on any life insurance policy he has, but I didn't do the same for him. Lets be clear, the only policies he has are the ones that banks make you take out when you get a loan. I'm not even sure if these continue after the loan is paid. I don't expect any kind of big payout if he dies. Also there is no chance of his life insurance finding its way to his ex if he leaves the policy to me. The situation is not the same.\n\nSo Reddit, I feel like I did this for good reasons, but tell me....AITA?", "created_utc": 1679974199, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/124b76r/aita_for_making_my_son_my_beneficiary/", "score": 203, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If you haven\u2019t explained that then I would if I were you. If you left it to your husband he could say it will go to Kent if he passes but then not split things equally between the boys after and give his sons a bigger cut of everything else because you are giving your son the policy. Their mother has the opportunity to give them a life insurance policy from her. And again you believe this is what your mom would want.", "NTA. It\u2019s your money. If you chose to leave it to your son there\u2019s nothing wrong with that. If \u201cMike\u201d is a upset with that, that\u2019s on him. He can change his beneficiaries to be his children.", "100% NTA. It is two completely different situations.", "NAH - you're entitled to make whoever you want the beneficiary, but he's also entitled to be a little hurt and feel like you maybe don't trust him 100%\n\nIt sounds like you don't particularly mind the thought of your stepsons getting some of the money if there's no way it can ever get to their other mom? If this is the case, and you trust your husband, why not ask him to make a will stating that if he should pass before his ex wife, that the insurance money would go solely to your son? \n\nIf that's not the case, then I'd be inclined to stick to the \"it's what my mother wanted\" reason with your husband. Otherwise it does kinda sound like you don't have 100% trust in him, and that'll hurt him. \n\nI'm taking a guess here that there are a variety of reasons that hubby's ex is simply a money vortex, and if there's money in her proximity she often gets it or it's used to pay for problems she has caused. If that's how you feel, you should explain that to your husband.", "You probably should have had a frank discussion with him before making that change.  The change makes sense, but big financial decisions really should be discussed before pulling the trigger on anything.  You'll both be more comfortable that way.\n\nNAH, but every marriage should involve discussing finances.", "NTA\n\nWhilst my parents do have themselves as the first point of inheritance, when the second parent passes they have split the estate to account for the fact that some of the children will have another inheritance from another parent at some point (so 50% for the kids the two of them had together, 25% for her children from former relationship, and 25% for his children from former relationship)\n\nBut that's because it relates to money from them. This is technically money from your mother, and it going to her grandchild sounds perfectly reasonable! I'm sorry your husband isn't being understanding about this.\n\nIt's not like you're entailing your half of your entire estate to your son, it's this one policy, and I'd assume the rest of your estate is being left to your spouse.", "I know that you have to plan for anything happening any time. You could also change it in the future. But you could very well live for quite awhile longer depending on your age, so that money may not be seen by your son for another 30 years just a random number since I don\u2019t know your age. And under the circumstance that if you died then husband died then all 3 get it, that\u2019s a lot of ifs and then one lives with his mom still which a lot of stars would have to align for the ex to see a penny of that money. Anyway, you could have it so that your husband is the beneficiary and your son is the secondary, and your husband could have a will that any remaining money would go to Kent in the event that he passes as well. Or you could also name both as beneficiaries as 50/50.\nOr you could keep it the way it is but there are other options to protect all the what ifs and keep the husband happy.", "NAH. You and your husband ought to go through the process of writing your wills and talking through these issues.", "YTA-- You made a big decision without your spouse and frankly, the wrong decision. If your step kids learn of this, they will hate you forever because you obviously don't love them as much as your bio kid.", "NTA\n\nUltimately, it's your money to decide what to do with.  If your husband hasn't been capable of setting good boundaries with his ex or his sons, which seems like part of the inspiration for this decision, then he has only himself to blame for your lack of trust.  \n\nNow, it's still valid for him to feel betrayed by it.  Let him feel how he feels, but as long as he doesn't make a huge issue out of it or bully you or try to make you change, then hopefully it will be forgotten in time, just like you did before you cleaned out your mom's things.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Hopefully he will process the surprise and other emotions and come to see it as you do.\n\nKent is his son, too.", "NTA.  Do what your mom would want.", "NTA your reasoning is more than sound. Your husband doesn\u2019t need your life insurance, and his kids really don\u2019t need it.", "NAH. You didn't provide the ages of your stepsons or any details on your relationships with them. But, to your husband, it probably seems as if you're disinheriting your older sons. If you don't have a close relationship with them, that might not be surprising. But it likely feels unloving even if it's not surprising.", "NTA.", " NTA. Your reasoning is perfectly sound to me. It\u2019s likely that if you left it to your husband, the best case is that after he passed, Kent would end up with a third of his estate. The worst case is that after you pass away, your husband marries someone with children & his estate ends up going to her & her kids, & neither Kent nor your step kids see a dime of the money.", "NTA. Your mom paid for it, and you\u2019re honoring what you think she would want. She doesn\u2019t have any relationship with your step kids (I\u2019m assuming). \n\nFrankly, a life insurance policy seems like a really weird thing to fight about. It\u2019s not going to matter for 20-40 years.", "I did explain that to him.  I also explained about not wanting any of the money to end up in his ex's hands since Mike now lives with her.  He says he understands, but he's still giving off vides of being upset.  That's why I thought maybe I was wrong about this.  Thanks so much for the support.", "Your right about that. I should have.", "You are correct. Our joint savings and checking a will all be his. Also any possessions will be his, with the exception my uncles Purple Heart medal. My mothers brother and I want that to go to Kent as well.", "NTA\n\nYour mom paid for it and would want it to be used for her grandchild, not his kids babymomma.", "NTA but you might compromise by awarding a specific amount to them and stipulating that the step sons only have money in an account that can't be accessed until they are adults in order to protect them from the mother accessing it while they are kids?\n\nEven if the lion's share goes to Kent, it might make your step sons feel included as part of the family inheritance.", "NTA", "So your son is only inheriting money from the life insurance policy? That\u2019s odd. My state makes it 50% to husband and 50% to children even if a will is in place. The child can contest.", "Soft YTA\n\nIf your concerns were what would happen to the money if your husband died without a will, the solution there would be to ensure he had a will. And if you\u2019re worried that the money would go to his ex through her kids\u2026 it would be their choice what they did with the money - you would be gone and blissfully unaware, and to withhold money from them because of their mother is a bit spiteful.\n\nI also think you\u2019re a little biased as to what your mother would have wanted, and I think it\u2019s a bit sad that you don\u2019t consider your husband\u2019s children as much your own as Kent - you\u2019re their stepmother and they lived with you growing up. It\u2019s a bit bio-child favouritism which rubs me the wrong way. \n\nLastly, you should have discussed it with your husband first. \n\nUltimately it\u2019s your policy and your decision what you do with it - hence the \u2018soft\u2019 - but I do think it was the wrong choice.", "NTA.

Then you and your husband can take out 'real' insurance policies on each other.\n\nYou should also see a financial planner to see how the ex can be excluded from receiving any money from the estate.
