We all have known each other since we were 8/9 yo.\n\nSo the thing is that for the pasts weeks I\u2019ve been trying to replicate a cake recipe, in order to prepare it correctly on my bd, which was Nov/18. This recipe is really special for me, since it\u2019s my dad\u2019s, and he prepared it for me every year. Sadly my dad, died on a car accident, 10 months ago. So this would be my first bd without him, and I wanted to have him \u201cpresent\u201d that day.\n\nThe recipe is really \u201csimple\u201d. It\u2019s a chocolate cake with strawberries and coffee. However it has a lot of steps, and I am not good at baking. R offered to help me, he isn\u2019t that good but he knows more than me. So every Wednesday I\u2019d go to his house and we would try to recreate the \u201cChocolate menace\u201d (That\u2019s how R named it). \n\nThose weeks were kinda rough, we had very terrible failures. But in the end we were able to have a decent replicate. That day we invited G and F to have a try and they loved it.\n\nSo a day before my bd I asked for R's help. The cake looked amazing and I was really excited for it. Well, my bd arrives and we have a small get-together in my house. We are all having a great time. Then it\u2019s time to cut the cake, I go for it and I find it looking weird. I turn it around and realize that at least half of the cake it\u2019s gone. \n\nI go to the living room and ask if someone took a piece of cake. I was really mad, and I could feel some tears on my cheek. F tells me that we could buy another one. That only makes me more mad and again ask, who took a piece. Finally G confessed, but told me that I was making a scene for nothing. I just lose it and yell at him to get out. \n\nAfter that some of my friends left, and R tried to cheer me up by telling me he would bake another one for me. However, G and F sent me passive aggressive dms of how crazy i acted over a cake. Some of my other friends agree with them, while R and others tell me i wasn\u2019t in the wrong.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1669026025, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z0vgtu/aita_for_getting_mad_at_a_friend_for_eating_a/", "score": 123, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It was already incredibly rude, but knowing that this cake has a sentimental value to you, and that you worked hard to bake it properly, makes it all the worse.
