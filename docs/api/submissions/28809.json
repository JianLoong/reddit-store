We're the same age and have the same position but we work in different locations, which limits our daily interactions. A few months ago, our company posted openings for a management and a specialist role. While I was interested in both, I was more inclined to the first. I was also aware that AA had applied for the specialist position so I only applied for the management role. Neither of us got it, which left me discontent, especially with ongoing structural changes within the company.\r  \n\r  \nI told another colleague(BB), that I was unhappy and wanted to leave the company. BB is a close friend and one of the specialists. He asked whether I'd want his role. I would but was hesitant because this role was commission-based and I had just bought a house. A week later, BB said there was an opening in his team and he could refer me. I asked if he knew anything about the applicant pool and AA. He said the job had been posted for a month, with limited interest, as his manager was still actively searching. BB said he didnt think AA applied. Assuming AA might not apply so soon after his rejection, I decided to submit my application.\r  \n\r  \nToday, I was talking to AA and asked if he knew about the opening. He said he was talking to the hiring manager. I asked how he would feel if I applied and he said he would be angry and I shouldn't do it. I admitted I already applied. He got angry and accused me of trying to sabotage him. He said I had a bad sense of ethics and I was taking something important from him. He said I knew how important it was for him and shouldn't have applied. The fact that I didn't tell him beforehand means I have a very low standard of ethics.\r  \n\r  \nI told him I found that very hurtful. I have nothing but praise for him when I'm talking with other coworkers and I was even telling BB how I thought AA would be great for the position.I know this position means a lot for him but it also means a lot to me. Just because it matters more to him than to me doesn't make him entitled to apply for it. I consider him a friend and that's why I wanted to tell him I applied. I think he does deserve the role but regardless of who gets it, I wont have any hard feelings. In fact, if he gets it, I would be happy for him because he's been working for it for a long time. The conversation ended with him saying whatever and guilting me by saying if he doesn't get it, he'll have no choice but to leave the company so he will spend the weekend applying to other companies.\r  \n\r  \nI don't think I'm the a-hole here. Could I have handled it better? Sure. I could have talked to him first. That said, that shouldn't stop me from applying. If the roles were reversed, I would wish him  nothing but the best and support him.

Apparently I should have told my friend/coworker before applying and by not doing so, it shows i have a low sense of morals. We had a 20 minute conversation and he says he is trying to explain to me why what I did was wrong but I'm not getting it because I have a low standard of ethics. According to him, what I did was betrayal and i am purposely sabotaging him because I don't want the position as much as he does\n\nHelp keep the sub engaging!\n\n#Don\u2019t downvote assholes!\n\nDo upvote interesting posts!\n\n [Click Here For Our Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules) and [Click Here For Our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\n\n##Subreddit Announcements\n\n###[Happy Anniversary, AITA!](https://new.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15vlv9g/almost_better_than_a_double_rainbow_celebrating/)\n\nFollow the link above to learn more\n\n---\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

If they are that emotional and inappropriate with you about the role, chances are that others know how AA is too.\n\nNot your responsibility, you did everything above and beyond what fidelity to your coworkers and workplace demanded.

Even if OP did know, they would be completely within their right to apply. It's management job to choose the most qualified candidate.", "I think you need to say less regardless of the situation. Reading your post I kept thinking \"stop talking!\". No one, not even your manager, needs to know you applied to a job. Not to mention you were recommended by BB for it.", "Question: Did he consider you at all? Or the fact that you might also want the job?\n\nWhy is he wanting the job more important than you wanting it? Why are you the one expected to give up something you want for his sake? Why can't he? By his logic, he also lacks those ethics.\n\nThis is really not your friend. You should reconsider this friendship. Some things you can give up for the sake of friendship. But a job is not one of them. And from now on, keep your career moves to yourself. Unless talking to a person who can help advance them.\n\nEdited."]}
