My husband works a full time job and I run my own at home bakery and sell at farmers markets. I\u2019m maybe 4-6 weeks at this point so still very early and will be going to my first appt in a few weeks.  I have been feeling very sick the past few days to the point that some days housework does not get done. Last night I was up until about 1am because I felt so bad I couldn\u2019t sleep. My husband comes home from work, I tell him the dog been crying the whole time he has been gone. He replied back \u201cor maybe it\u2019s that shit smell.\u201d I get upset at this and ask him what he is talking about. He was apparently talking about the mint sented oil i had on a cotton ball to keep me from getting sick. Which I tell him a little angry \u201cthat doesn\u2019t mean you have to be mean about it, because that oil is the only thing keeping me from getting sick\u201d \n\nThen from there he see Wendy\u2019s in the trash can and gets upset that I had taken the kids for Wendy\u2019s drive threw for dinner, and that I had not done any housework or dishes (we have no dish washer so I have to hand wash everything). He also proceeded to tell me the pregnant women at his work can do their job and don\u2019t feel sick, and wanted me to exsplain to him why this is. I can\u2019t really explain why but tried anyway telling him \u201cidk they probably do feel as bad as I do or maybe they have medicine to help keep them from feel as bad\u201d. He tried to justify that it was ok for him to be upset because the house smelled bad to him (he does not like mint), the AC was on to high, getting take out is my answer to everything and that he is allowed to feel how he feels.\n\n*edit post* for those keep saying homemaker I have time to clean. I\u2019m am not. I own my own at Home Bakery with a business license that brings in $400-$800 in a given week in just baked goods alone. (I sell other items as well) And the take out is maybe 1 or 2 a week when I don\u2019t have time to cook dinner.

How dare he compare you to other women who are pregnant at his work?! The audacity!

I\u2019ll do the dishes etc whilst you rest. Let me know if there is anything else I can do.\u201d\n\nGoing into a cold minty house does not excuse his poor behaviour and frankly he should be apologising, not trying to justify his awfulness. \n\nDo not put up with bs.

Next time he compares you to other women, compare him to other men you know. Someone richer, someone kinder, someone hotter and ask him how he feels. I really don't want to egg on a fight between a couple but some people are just ridiculous. How has this man fathered a child with you already and not understand the differences in pregnancies?

Everyone experiences pregnancy differently. My pregnancies absolutely sucked, I had no energy, I felt like death, I hated my pregnancies, but I absolutely adore my babies. However my best friend LOVED her pregnancy, she felt more energy than ever, she felt like she literally glowed. Everyone is different. And for your husband to show absolutely no sympathy for how you were feeling, and just tell you off because the house isn't clean? No. Absolutely not.

Usually hitting its peak at week 9. \nYou might have Hyperemesis gravidarum, which is really bad morning sickness all day during your entire pregnancy. If you keep feeling bad, go to your doctor and have them check you out.\n\nFor me personally pregnancy is a sort of hell, because of pelvic pain and other nasty symptoms, but I have a colleague who loves being pregnant and is very sad that she and her partner have the number of children they decided they wanted, because she now does not get to experience pregnancy again. I cannot really phantom wanting to be pregnant, because to me it really was something I endured. It's really ignorant of your husband to compare you with other pregnant people. He should educate himself.", "NTA, you would think that your husband has some compassion since this is your second child together. Every pregnancy is different.

Give him a very detailed timeline of your day to prove that you really are working. Ask him if he thinks he could do a better job, if he says yes- well then he can prove it this weekend. Leave him to do everything while you rest or even disappear for 8-10 hours both days.   \n\nHe doesn't get to complain about not having a day off as you never get one.   If he doesn't change his tune after dealing with the kids all weekend, doing all the chores,  home cooked meals and all,  then maybe you should consider Marriage counseling.", "I'm guessing this is why his last relationship didn't last............ you know where this is going.\n\nMy husband works to provide and I'm not well with some health issues and he picks up the slack.....

It's because he's full of sh*t. I used to throw up in the bushes on my way into work in the morning. I still went to work but I was definitely sick.

How often are you going out to get it instead of cooking? How often does the house work not get done? Were these similar problems in your first marriage? Did you help out during your previous pregnancy with him? Feel like hubby's side of the story may be a bit different. He's working all day, and your work as a homemaker isn't getting done. If you're not doing any housework and can't afford to hire help, then it falls to him to do this, which as essentially doubled his workload and I would be frustrated by this also.

Your only 4 - 6 weeks pregnant so he probably imagining the next 8 months of this: Kids unhealthy, house unclean, house too cold, house smelling (essential oils make me nauseas so I would be unhappy too).

Him saying that other women handle it differently is like saying someone being upset at a parent or pet dying should always be the same, that everyone feels pain the exact same way so if he passes a kidney stone he should feel the exact same way as everyone else that passes one (and thats just not true).

High hCG can cause nausea and hCG which is why women pregnant with multiples have a higher rate of morning sickness and HG (\"super morning sickness\"). Placenta makes the hCG and if you have more placentas you're going to have more hCG. Gestational diabetes comes from the placenta. We don't know all that much about pre-eclampsia but we know that the only treatment is getting the baby and the placenta out and it is thought to be hereditary also through the father's line. I hardly need to mention dna each baby receives from their father isn't the same every time and two babies with different fathers will have very different genes. Then there is placement of the placenta, most people and most pregnancies have the placenta places posterior. This means that the placenta is between you and the baby on the inside, sorta top-back. But it can literally be on any side and where the placenta is located plays a huge part in what the experience feels like. Even down to how you can give birth if you are one of the unfortunate few where the placenta is over the cervix and thus blocking the exit evolution intended the baby to take and a c-section is necessary. Sometimes the baby spends a lot of time in the transverse position. Aka horizontally inside the uterus. This can mean a lot of kicking on the small lower ribs and hurt like an sob. Obviously you can't tell baby to turn around and a medical turn is not done until the baby can safely exit because when you turn the baby you also risk placental abruption (ripping the placenta loose and the placenta supplies oxygen to baby) necessitating an emergency c-section. If you have a wide uterus the baby has a lot of tumble space and may prefer one side. This is fine until they get lodged in that position and you have a baby who's perpetually kicking you in the kidney or even blocking off the entire urinary system on one side. \n\nAll of these things and many more will differ from pregnancy to pregnancy even in the same woman, doing the same things, eating the same foods and being the same height and weight. \n\nPregnancy also changes a woman permanently. Her milk comes in sooner, her bump pops earlier and she has more&earlier braxton-hicks (\"practice contractions\") with her subsequent pregnancies than her first. She also ages and with ages the risk of new&\"exciting\" complications increases.
