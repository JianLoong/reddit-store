She\u2019s cheating on you or is planning to. There is no excuse for her lying to you about what she was doing. The way she reacted probably made you feel a little crazy. She has broken your trust and if you stay with her it\u2019ll happen again no matter what she\u2019s saying now. Freaking out in the restaurant wasn\u2019t the best way to handle it but who can say how they\u2019d react if it happened to them. The same thing actually happened to me once, I was out to dinner with a friend and saw my bf with another woman at the same restaurant I was at on the way out. I just got really cold inside, stared at him and walked past him. He blew my phone up for the rest of the night but I never answered.

How is everyone ignoring the fact that she lied to go and meet another guy in a RESTAURANT  for a whole DAY???? If that isnt cheating i dont know what is.

There\u2019s definitely zero trust. \n\nYou want to know where she is all the time, but you don\u2019t say you messaged her to let her know you were going out as well- so you only expect HER to have to check in with you?  \n\nAnd I call BS on you just walking by a random restaurant with her in it. What gives you any reason to doubt he is a friend and she is actually cheating?

This is the sort of toxic stuff that can make it hard for either of you to be happy.", "ESH, people saying NTA are completely ignoring what she did but judging you for blowing up in a rude manner, frankly both are really AH moves. You shouldn\u2019t have been verbally harsh, keep the higher ground and ask your questions when you caught her in the act. If the answers weren\u2019t good at least you left as the better person.\n\nYou asked, didn\u2019t get an answer. Asked again (why?), got your answer, offered to accompany, and left her alone after she turned down the request. \n\nWhat irks me about you is that you persisted to ask again right after her initial brush off, like you NEEDED to know. Are you like this normally? Was she caught lying before? Need some more background info on anything that happened before, you both seem on edge. Not a lot of trust here from both ends.\n\nIf she doesn\u2019t feel comfortable to tell you simple meetups after a year, she should leave. If you don\u2019t like how she holds information, you should leave.", "Esh\n\nWhy were you so persistent in asking her where she was going? It sounds like there's a history of you two not trusting each other.", "ESH.  Her for lying, you for not handling yourself better.  \n   \nThat said - this relationship is over.  Sorry buddy.", "ESH because we don't have enough information.\n\nYou're wrong for demanding to know your girlfriend's whereabouts. You've been dating a year but still basically she should be allowed to come and go as she pleases without checking in all the time. It is a form of respecting the relationship to give you the courtesy of saying where she'll be, but that's it: a courtesy. Not a requirement.\n\nShe's wrong for lying to you. Even if you're controlling, she should leave (when safe) instead of lying. The lies will only compound the issue of lack of trust or isolation. And to lie about something serious like parents being hospitalized -- that's odd because one would typically expect their relationship partner to be there for them and accompany them instead of hanging back at the spot watching TV.\n\nYou also did lose your cool at the restaurant. I could get maybe taking pictures to talk later in private, but storming in to confront your girlfriend directly was kinda making a scene which would disrupt others' dining experience. Especially if this meeting with David was somehow innocent and there might be potential jealousy issues. But there's no reason to imagine or not imagine that.  At least from this story you didn't blame David right off the bat.", "YTA. She's lying to you, and that's not great. But you sound like a controlling jerk, and calling her a \"fucking b****\" is just verbal abuse. And you \"went to help a friend,\" and just happened to pass by the restaurant where she was? Seems likely.", "ESH. It's assholes all the way down.", "ESH.\n\nI mean, it's pretty obvious you interrupted her date, which she planned to last overnight. The quality of her character is obvious there.\n\nBut you sunk down to nearly her level - I understand walking into the restaurant to confirm the situation, but causing a scene, calling names, and still referring to her as your girlfriend are not a good look.\n\nIgnore the petty insults from a cheater and move on with your life.", "She lied and was secretly meeting him. NTA for those things. Lashing out like that? YTA.", "YTA for yelling at your gf for any reason lol. I mean now we know why she can\u2019t be honest with you.", "NTA. If someone was going to a restaurant just to meet up with a friend and talk, there's absolutely no reason to lie about it. If she were REALLY just seeing a friend that's where she would have told you she was going. Making up a lie about her family being in the hospital is an AH move anyway. HOWEVER. I can see some room for more context that could change that verdict. For instance, if she had told you about meet ups with friends in the past and you flipped the hell out about it. If she has told you about several innocent outings that resulted in a big fight, I could see why she would choose to hide a meet up from you. The fact that she was so unfazed by your appearance at the restaurant tells me that the second scenario is a possible one. If so, then YTA. But with the context I'm given in this post the verdict is:\n\nNTA.", "NTA.\n\nShiny horns you got there bud.", "ESH, you for causing a scene in the restaurant, and your girlfriend for being a liar.  The jury's still out on whether she's a cheat, but it's certainly possible.  Cheating aside, if you choose to stay with a liar, at least you know what to expect in the future.  But seriously, what good can come of this relationship?  Move on.", "ESH her for lying, you for being so persistent about knowing where she was going.

If she had nothing to hide, she could have told you she was meeting a friend for diner... unless you have an habit of being controlling and jealous and don't want her to have male friends, in which case she's be better off without you.", "ESH it sounds like she's cheating and you're an abusive asshole", "INFO: Why had she felt the need to lie? I don't trust this is the full story.", "Well if she feels she has to lie to you there is something wrong you can meet a friend but if you have to lie about there is more at hand sound like not a very healthy relationship", "YTA, its obvious she went out to talk with a friend over food, after she visited her parents, why do you feel like you should get to dictate what she does with her free time", "ESH, but you're obviously being cheated on. Time to leave.", "YTA for yelling but NTA for being mad. Your gf was on a date with another guy, that's why she lied to you. Sounds like this relationship is over.", "ESH \nWhy do you care so much??  Can she really not do anything without telling you?   So she ate with someone, you think yelling at her is gonna make her love you more?  Leave her and try to be less demanding in the future.
