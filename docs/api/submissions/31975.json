We have an in law suite in our house that wasn't being used and I couldn't in good conscious let those kids keep sleeping rough knowing I had the room for them. They moved in and we're a family now. My husband and I never had kids of our own so these two are our kids now. They're incredible. We love them dearly and spoil them rotten.  \n\n\nBoth kids were discarded by their bio families because they are LGBTQIA.

When she would come to visit, she would stay in the in law suite so I let her know that she would need to stay upstairs in the guest room instead of in the suite. She asked why. I told her the story of J and B. My sister didn't visit when she said she would so I called her up to check in. She proceeded to tell me that she felt that I had let demons into my home willingly and that by letting the kids live here ... I was sinning. I told her that I accepted that she could have that opinion, but what I did in my home was my business and since she had not met the kids ... she had no right to call them demons. They're amazing humans.   \n\n\nSo, for two years now, she's been sending me sermons and preaching at me.

She was there and knew I was fine.  \n\n\nTHEN ... the police come knocking at my door as we sit down to eat Thanksgiving dinner with the now 20 year olds. My crazy sister had called them for a welfare check and made it seem like I was being held hostage by people in my house. The cops came in all aggressive and demanded to search my house (for what!?!) and then sat me down in a separate room and grilled me about why I'd let strangers live in my house, were they harming me or holding stuff over my head, was my husband abusing me, could they see my arms for bruises, etc ...   \n\n\nI was so traumatized by how we were all treated that I called my sister and told her I'm filing a restraining order and want no further contact with her.

One of my least favorite archetypes of people. \n\nFile that restraining order. Her behavior is ridiculous.", "NTA.  This must have been terrifying.  I hope you do file for a restraining order on your sister.

She filed a false complaint with the intention of driving the police to your home. This could have gone terribly, terribly wrong for you and your family in so many ways. You are very lucky that the police did not assume anyone was armed. Someone could have been killed.\n\nYou need to not only put out a restraining order; you need to look into whether or not you can file charges against her. It is also critically important that you get your side of the story on the record and make sure that local authorities are familiar with the situation. I am not joking here. Her actions put your physical safety at risk, and there is no guarantee she will not try this again.\n\nIt goes without saying that you are NTA, but I will say it anyway.", "NTA-it is time for that restraining order and to go no contact with her.

I have never heard of swatting but I just looked it up and that sounds exactly right. From what the officers said, she made it seem like she was scared for my safety and that something ominous had transpired to keep me away from my relatives. The cops demanded to see my arms, legs, back, and neck to verify that I had no injuries. We are ABSOLUTELY going to get this all documented with the police and try for a restraining order.

He advised us over the phone to NOT go to the police at all unless he is present and to have zero contact with my sister or any other member of the family until he can review all the paperwork (messages) I've printed. He mentioned that sending a Cease and Desist letter to my sister from his office would be an option. We will be going to his office tomorrow to give him what we have and talk about all our options. He has also advised that he is very interested in what transpired with the police who came to our house and threatened to arrest us if we did not forfeit our Fourth Amendment rights to search and seizure. We talked for about 20 minutes. We'll go deeper into it all tomorrow with him.   \n\n\nThank you all for the advice. I really appreciate it. My extended family is trying to make me feel bad.

And - in addition to a restraining order - you might want to explore with a local attorney whether you can file civil charges against her for compensation for harassment and intentional infliction of emotional distress. \n\n\"No good deed goes unpunished\", it is said. I am so sorry your sister so relentlessly has tried to make that true for you. \n\nThank you for making the world a better place by making place in your home and family of choice for this young couple in need.

Do not give her an empty threat. Go to your local county courthouse and issue a protective restraining order against your sister. That way if she contacts you in any way shape or form you can have her arrested for violating the order. I would call what your sister did as swatting. This is when somebody calls the police and tells them somebody's life is in danger so the police show up with their adrenaline racing, guns drawn and attitudes that are beyond comprehension. Your sister called them, they came and you and the people in your house felt your lives were in grave danger. Get every piece of evidence you can, every text, every message, you call histories and every other communication and print them up. Make copies of all of them and give one to the detective when you speak to him. I am not sure if they are city police or county sheriffs. Find out because this can be important. Have the detective give you copies of the police report and all messages the police wrote in the report. Also make sure you get every police officers names and badge numbers. Who let the detective know that you were going to want copies of each and every one of their body cam footages. Go to your county courthouse and have somebody help you file the paperwork and then go in front of a magistrate or judge for the protection order and make sure you give them a copies of everything you have. This way it is all going to be put into the records. Tell the magistrate or judge how the police treated you and your family and how they made you fear for your lives. Ask the judge or magistrate to issue subpoenas for the body cam footages so they can be put into the records as well. Ask the magistrate or judge what you can do if they come back to your house again. Ask the judge or magistrate if you can make the police leave your property if they come to your house again. Ask if you can tell them to leave immediately because they have no right to be on your property without a warrant. Ask if you can tell them if they want to get a warrant to go see the judge who gave you the protection order. Write down any questions you have for a judge or magistrate including what other charges you can press against your sister for putting your lives in danger. I am not a lawyer, but I grew up in a family of lawyers and you need to protect yourself and those on your property. If your sister or any of her flying monkeys try contacting you tell them all to f off and block them on everything including your phone, social media, Facebook, everything. You do not need these type of people in your lives. You and your husband enjoy your chosen family and continue to spoil them rotten ok sunshine xoxo", "There's no hate like Christian love, good luck with the RO, you and yoyr husband are good people and deserve some peace and quiet.

Block her phone number, and block her from your social media.

Sure, the people you brought into your home may be \"sinning\" according to Christianity. BUT also according to Christianity, Jesus preaches in the Gospels that we need to practice the Corporal Works of Mercy, by sheltering and feeding people who are in need. Jesus never said that you should only feed and shelter people who believe in Him.
