We have an in law suite in our house that wasn't being used and I couldn't in good conscious let those kids keep sleeping rough knowing I had the room for them. They moved in and we're a family now. My husband and I never had kids of our own so these two are our kids now. They're incredible. We love them dearly and spoil them rotten.  \n\n\nBoth kids were discarded by their bio families because they are LGBTQIA. Both were born biologically female but one (J) is transitioning to male and the other (B) is nonbinary. They're together romantically.  \n\n\nMy sister (59F) lives in another city about three hours away. When she would come to visit, she would stay in the in law suite so I let her know that she would need to stay upstairs in the guest room instead of in the suite. She asked why. I told her the story of J and B. My sister didn't visit when she said she would so I called her up to check in. She proceeded to tell me that she felt that I had let demons into my home willingly and that by letting the kids live here ... I was sinning. I told her that I accepted that she could have that opinion, but what I did in my home was my business and since she had not met the kids ... she had no right to call them demons. They're amazing humans.   \n\n\nSo, for two years now, she's been sending me sermons and preaching at me. My husband and I skipped Thanksgiving to avoid her because last year was AWFUL with her sermons. I called and told my gathered family Happy Thanksgiving and sent my love but that was it. She was there and knew I was fine.  \n\n\nTHEN ... the police come knocking at my door as we sit down to eat Thanksgiving dinner with the now 20 year olds. My crazy sister had called them for a welfare check and made it seem like I was being held hostage by people in my house. The cops came in all aggressive and demanded to search my house (for what!?!) and then sat me down in a separate room and grilled me about why I'd let strangers live in my house, were they harming me or holding stuff over my head, was my husband abusing me, could they see my arms for bruises, etc ...   \n\n\nI was so traumatized by how we were all treated that I called my sister and told her I'm filing a restraining order and want no further contact with her. This is TOO FAR. She knew I was fine. She knows that no one is harming me.

Your sister is unmoored from reality, and she should face charges for making a false report to police. Someone, including you!, could have been seriously injured or killed in a police raid.  You might reach out to a local LGBTQ+ group or the Human Rights Campaign for support and resources.", "NTA and you should file that RO as soon as you can.", "A year ago you had a 21 year old son with a 23 year old gf. Same kids?", "NTA\u2026 also don\u2019t let the cops in without a warrant.", "NTA\n\nShe should be charged for misuse of police and putting you through that situation. \n\nThat woman is mentally unwell.", "INFO: Do you intend to follow through or not?", "NTA. What the sister is doing is harassment.", "NTA. She\u2019s unhinged.", "NTA. Your sister has her own prejudices/opinions/stances/values, whatever. She is free to voice them. But she absolutely cannot endanger you and your family's lives on a whim. Can charges be filed for wasting police resources/swatting in your state?", "NTA - Seems like you're doing something mostly selfless for two young adults who were cast aside for trying to be themselves. \n\nYour sister seems like a religious zealot who needs to for their beliefs on everyone else. One of my least favorite archetypes of people. \n\nFile that restraining order. Her behavior is ridiculous.", "NTA.  This must have been terrifying.  I hope you do file for a restraining order on your sister.  Perhaps she also needs psychiatric assessment if she thinks pushing her religious views and pulling a stunt like this is OK.", "NTA\n\nWhat she did is called \"swatting\" and she can and should face legal consequences for it. Please look into this and file charges against her. \n\nYou and your husband are good souls, keep it up. I'm so glad J and B have you.", "One rule of legal actions is don't tell your opponent what's coming down the pipe if you don't legally have to.\n\nLet her find out from her own lawyer\n\nIf you're going to be in a legal war, don't help your opponent", "NTA for telling her. Won't be when you actually file it.\n\nAlso, you don't have a sister anymore.", "Whoa! What your sister did to you was essentially swatting. She filed a false complaint with the intention of driving the police to your home. This could have gone terribly, terribly wrong for you and your family in so many ways. You are very lucky that the police did not assume anyone was armed. Someone could have been killed.\n\nYou need to not only put out a restraining order; you need to look into whether or not you can file charges against her. It is also critically important that you get your side of the story on the record and make sure that local authorities are familiar with the situation. I am not joking here. Her actions put your physical safety at risk, and there is no guarantee she will not try this again.\n\nIt goes without saying that you are NTA, but I will say it anyway.", "NTA-it is time for that restraining order and to go no contact with her.  You did a wonderful thing taking in those kids. They are family. None of you deserve the stuff your sister is starting.", "Oh wow. U actually have to ask If U r the NTA? NTA big time and Cut Ur sister Off ASAP.\nU r an amazing human being and I Bet J and B can't be happier to have U Guys.\nIs it possible for U to adopt Them? If yes, make Sure to send Ur sister a \"we r a Happy Family now, especially without U\" Card ;)", "SB forever and always. Eden and Cruz were my everything.   \n\n\nWe got both kids to start going to a LGBTQIA support group and they've made a ton of friends. My husband and I have gone as well to support them. I will absolutely talk to the director of those meetings to see if they have any additional resources.", "Yep. Same kids. I call them my son and daughter. They have what they call an open relationship where they see other people which I don't understand, but I'm good with whatever makes them happy. The peanut allergy girl is no longer in the picture.", "since the sister made it seem like it was an emergency, police is allowed to get in without a warrant.", "We plan on calling today and setting up an appointment to go in and speak with anofficer/detective. I spent the entire night printing out a ton of chat convos that prove she is harassing me and calling me vicious and hate filled things for simply having compassion for two kids alone in the world.", "Thank you. I have never heard of swatting but I just looked it up and that sounds exactly right. From what the officers said, she made it seem like she was scared for my safety and that something ominous had transpired to keep me away from my relatives. The cops demanded to see my arms, legs, back, and neck to verify that I had no injuries. We are ABSOLUTELY going to get this all documented with the police and try for a restraining order. I don't want any more of her sermons, hate speech, or diatribes coming my way.   \n\n\nThank you.", "We were given a card by the police with the number of an officer/detective and instructed to call to schedule a time to talk to him. We are going to ... our only delay is that I have been printing off our message exchanges to take in as proof of what REALLY happened. Even if they deny us a restraining order ... I want it documented that she did this. It was absolutely terrifying to have my house filled with armed people who were rude and demanding and hateful to us on a dang holiday. Unacceptable. Thank you for replying.", "This! A restraining order is absolutely ok, but not quite enough.\n\nApart from everything Groovebat writes above, I think you should also inform the rest of your family about her behaviour.\n\nEdit to add; absolutely NTA and you are amazing person for taking these young people in \u2764\ufe0f", "In early August, we actually all got dressed up in complementary colors and took the first 'family' photo that my husband and I have ever been able to get of something other than just ourselves. It's us, J and B, and all of our furbabies. It was turned into a lovely Christmas card that we'll be sending out to everyone ... except my sister. Thank you. :)  \n\n\nSince they are adults I don't know if we can adopt them but I can promise you that in our hearts ... they've always been our kids and we couldn't love them more if we tried."]}
