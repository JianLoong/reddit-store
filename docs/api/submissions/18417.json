Kids are a handful, even for me. Most days my wife is called in to school to deal with our two youngest kids behaviors, on top of everything else she is doing. Unfortunately due to this, she lost her job. The kids are both under evaluation to get 504 plans and IEPs but the school is taking their sweet time (it's been over 2 months). So my wife has a really stressful week, damn near every week. Generally speaking she holds her composure incredibly well, which is why I'm so baffled by her blow up tonight. I work 50-60hrs a week. Leave at 5:30a and get home usually by 8p and make sure to help around the house before doing anything but she's still stressed (understandably). \n\nWife has been a bit more snippy lately and losing patience. Been snapping at the kids more often and snapping at the dog A LOT more often (the dog has anxiety and whines frequently, always has, as well as having behaviors of her own that are being worked on with a BT). My wife is just touched out, noticeably. But today she seemed fine. She was calm. Laughing. Smiling. Even brought the kids to the beach (I took work off early to meet them). When we got home she kind of \"checked out\" and went to the vehicle to listen to music while I got the kids in bed. But still seemed to be in a good mood when she came back inside an hour later. \n\nWe lay down and I call my dog on to the bed and was loving on her and then I said something like \"get momma\" or \"give momma loves\" (can't remember which). And my wife lost it a bit. Said something to the affect of \"I truly cannot understand why you think that I want you to shove that dog in my face every single fucking night after I am constantly overstimulated and overworked throughout the day. Keep the dog away from me. I don't want her to come get me. I don't ever want her in my face and I shouldn't have to tell you that.\" Claiming stupidity on this one, I do know that she doesn't like anything in her face and I honestly didn't realize the depth of that until tonight.

You call the oldest kid normal. Most parents who have a child with a disability don\u2019t use the term \u2018normal\u2019 to describe their neuro typical children. It makes me wonder if you are less involved with your kids and their disabilities/neuro divergence. It seems like you give your wife credit, but are you giving her help? Is she navigating parenting alone? \n\nAnother comment is that you said your kids are a handful even for you.

You sent YOUR dog over to your overwhelmed wife knowing she doesn\u2019t want that dog in her face and you did it for the dog\u2019s benefit because you think your wife loving on that dog will help it with its anxiety.

The law is on your side; they don't get to take their sweet time.\n\nIf the school can't handle your children to the extent that they're calling in your wife in so frequently she lost her job, they almost certainly need to have classroom aides for the kids as part of the 504 plan (as paid for by the district) or they need to provide your kids with an alternate school setting that can handle them.  They don't get to punt to your wife day after day.  They need to either find a way to educate your children in the classroom or admit they can't and pay for a school for kids with LD's.\n\nA good outside psychologist and/or a 504 advocate should be able to help you fashion your exact requests for the 504's.

But it won\u2019t help your child get the interventions needed outside of school. You need get a medical/psych evaluation done yesterday. Waiting lists are (unfortunately) ass.", "Sometimes we do things we didn't mean to do, and we're still accountable for it. It doesn't mean you're a bad person, but you should stop trying to push that interaction and just let it happen on her terms instead.", "Wait, so you ask her every night to do something that you *know* she hates doing!?!?! WHAT!?!?! \n\nThe context doesn\u2019t even matter - pet this dog, throw this frisbee, do this crossword puzzle - being asked *night after night*, by the person you love - WHO KNOWS YOU HATE THIS THING, to do something you don\u2019t enjoy is a whole different level of exhaustion. It\u2019s infuriating and SO incredibly disheartening. \n\nYou mentioned how well she communicates her needs to you, but this is such a shining example of how you fail to actually act on what she\u2019s telling you.", "Why do you care more about what helps your dog than what helps your wife?", "Dude, you absolutely do NOT do everything together as a team. You are not home and your wife is stressed out handling things by herself. Go handle the dog by yourself.", "But you did force affection. Your wife is more important than your dog. Or at least one would hope.", "Sure as shit doesn\u2019t sound like you handle childcare, housework, or mental load as a team, since you are literally out of the house most 14+ hours a day on weekdays.", "I am loathe to agree with you, yet the dog needs more than that poor woman can give. Ditto the whole family.", "Wait so you know your wife doesn't like the dog being in her face\n\nYou know your wife is overburdened and struggling\n\nAnd you *still* ask her to pet the dog every night?\n\nWow. Just wow.", "I had to look away from my phone for several seconds and take some deep breaths because it is so genuinely abhorrent to me that a grown adult would find it appropriate to talk this way about the children he is supposed to love more than anything.", "She's far more than just the primary caregiver, I'm betting. I find it hard to believe he does anything around the house. Anything.", "Damn, apparently working your ass off doesn\u2019t count for shit these days.", "Yes, in order to recieve any actual treatment and a diagnosis, you have to go to a real doctor (typically VERY expensive) and THEN, to get accommodations in school, you get to be watched by some under-qualified district employee so they can decide if you're *really* disabled enough (because why would they ever trust a doctor?) And if they decide that you are, *then* you can get accommodations. This typically takes months (because mental healthcare in schools is even more underfunded than school nurses and arts programs.)", "Good point. He doesn\u2019t seem useful at all.", "Of course it does. \n\nThat's precisely what OP's wife is doing. Working her ass off.", "I find this line rather telling: 'Kids are a handful, even for me'", "And OP? Working 75 hours a week doesn\u2019t constitute working your ass off?\n\nEveryone is acting like OP\u2019s wife is the only one doing it rough. I\u2019d take looking after 3 kids with behavioural issues over working 75 hours a week in a heart beat.", "Yeah that line was a red flag on its own", "No, you wouldn't.  With work,  you have lunch breaks,  vacation, sick time, as well as other times to take a break.  You don't get to take any breaks with children.  I deal with pissed off people all the time at my job, and I'd take that over watching children 24/7 anytime.  On top of that,  the breadwinner usually doesn't consider the stay at home the one bringing money home.  What that means is that the breadwinner doesn't like it when the stay at home partner spends money."]}
