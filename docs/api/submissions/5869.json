My siblings both have wavy soft hair, but mine is a lot more wild and curly. I don\u2019t mind. I usually fro it out or cornrow it, it\u2019s never been an issue for me. But my mom can\u2019t stand it. She\u2019s always wants to pick at it, comb it out (hard, she\u2019s not gentle, so ouch), iron it. She nags me non stop to shave it and when I refuse she gets mad. She always compares my hair to my siblings and says \u201cWhy couldn\u2019t you just have hair like them two! Your hair will be the death of me!\u201d while she\u2019s angrily picking at it because she guilted me into letting her \u201cfix it\u201d for the 900th time. She says it\u2019s because she doesn\u2019t want people making fun of me, she\u2019s used that same excuse since I was little, but nobody has said anything to me about it ever. It\u2019s only ever been her that\u2019s had a problem with it.\n\nI don\u2019t want to make it seem like she\u2019s a bad mom or anything. She\u2019s not. It\u2019s just on this one thing she never lets up. Calmly explaining to her that I like my hair the way it is and can do it myself does no good, I\u2019ve tried. She thinks that my hair isn\u2019t truly just mine because she\u2019s my mom so it\u2019s also hers too. So finally this morning while I was getting ready for work I reached my breaking point. It\u2019s cornrowed right now and growing out slightly, I just gel it a little bit and it looks fine. But she sees me in the bathroom and she storms right in and says \u201cOh my god! Caleb (that\u2019s my name) It\u2019s out of control, let me fix it!\u201d I tell her it\u2019s fine I don\u2019t need her to fix it, but she says \u201cIt\u2019s not fine! You can\u2019t see the back! I can!\u201d I guess she found a few loose hairs in the back and she tried \u201cuntangling\u201d them and ends up pulling HARD and it was right on the back of my neck and that shit hurt a lot, and I finally just snapped. I turned around and yelled and cussed at her \u201cMom I said don\u2019t touch my fucking hair!!! Get tf off me!!\u201d She just stared at me stunned for a second and says that she was just trying to help but I wasn\u2019t having it at that point and I kept yelling to stay the fuck away from me! Don\u2019t touch my hair ever again and if she does it one more time I\u2019m packing up my shit and moving out (I\u2019m 18). She just stands there staring at me and then her eyes get all teary and she leaves. I finish getting ready and storm out of the house furious even though my shift doesn\u2019t start for another two hours. \n\nNow I\u2019m sitting in my car still fuming but also feeling really guilty and my sister\u2019s texting me telling me how bad I made mom cry and that I need to apologize because I went too far. And I want to apologize but I\u2019m just so sick of this shit and I\u2019m pretty sure if I don\u2019t take full blame and just allow things to continue the way they are she\u2019s not gonna accept my apology anyways. I feel so bad but I\u2019m just so frustrated too. I know I shouldn\u2019t have cussed at her though. \ud83d\ude1e\n\nEdited for formatting.", "created_utc": 1672241771, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zxckrd/aita_for_blowing_up_at_my_mom_for_messing_with_my/", "score": 766, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I think this will be a good way, or not?", "NTA-don\u2019t feel bad you had an understandable reaction to an ongoing issue.  If you want to have a conversation about it write out what you want to say and then read it to her.  Tell her not to interrupt until you\u2019re done. Her behavior isn\u2019t acceptable even if she\u2019s an otherwise good mom.   If someone did this to my hair I\u2019d end them lol.", "Your mum's a lil bit racist. She has internalised a lots of fucked up racist stuff, which is not fair on her and tragic.\n\nBut she still has no right on weponisong her own racial and racist issues onto you. Because, even \"accidentally\", or unthinkingly that is exactly what she is doing. \n\nIt is only thanks to some other wonderful protective self esteem factors in your childhood, that you have been saved from absolutely hating yourself for absolutely no reason, because of your loving mum not unpacking her own trauma or racism. \n\nSo glad you have grown up know just how spectacular you are and just how spectacular you are externally - despite your mother's-demons best efforts. \n\nKindly, she needs kind, curious but serious, gentle therapy and needed it 18 years ago before she decided to have mixed race black kids. She is doing all three of you alot of damage with her shit. And she needs to cut it out and see how fucked up and racist she is being, and how incredibly abusive it actually is to ALL of you kids, but especially you.", "NTA! Wtf! Your hair your rules! I don\u2019t think you were out of line at all. If anything this may have been the only way to finally get her to listen. Hope things work out but I would definitely not back down.", "NTA.  I'm really sorry it built up for you like that and it came out this way.  \"I'm sorry for cussing at you\" could be a great conversation starter, because it sounds like you have regrets about that.  You have nothing to be sorry for as far as the hair, though.  I think maybe she realized in that moment just how much it meant to you, and that all that anger was caused by her.  If she's a good mom, she's thinking over all the times she's done your hair and she's gotta be figuring out what could have gone so wrong.  I am optimistic that she'll want YOUR forgiveness instead.", "She cried out of shock, not because OP was unfair. Apparently, she needed this to realise she's overstepping.\n\nOP, you don't have to apologize because you were right to stand up for yourself. I get that you're feeling bad tho. And I also get that you don't want to damage your relationship with your mom which seems to be loving besides the hair-issue.\n\nIf you'd like to apologize, you can. I even think this might be the smartest way to go. But make sure to only apologize for the yelling. You can phrase it like \"I apologize for yelling at you. I bet this must've been a shock\". BUT make sure to go on explaining WHY you've yelled at her and double down by saying, that no matter the yelling, you still expect her to respect you and stop overstepping your boundaries. You've gotta make that clear and she will have to agree - this is not negotiable. \n\nI think you'll have a good talk and a better relationship afterwards. \n\nAnyhow, NTA. She had it coming.", "I agree with another poster, apologize for cussing but not the content. And tell her there is no more discussions about your ethnic hair. Tell her you are not trying to Becky with the good hair (she knows what this means). Or tell her to watch the documentary Good Hair by Chris Rock. NTA.", "Ahhhhhh 100 percent hear you. Sending you a lot of encouragement and support. It will take some time but hoping with a good in depth discussion your mom comes around on this.", "We don\u2019t know the mom\u2019s motivation. It could be that there is a LOT of pressure on black children to be well groomed. My white kids can be messy af and are not judged nearly as harshly as black kids who are dressed exactly the same. So the mom fussing over the kid\u2019s hair might be wanting to get it looking super groomed with an eye on protecting her kid. \n\nStill agree that the mom needs to stop, but I don\u2019t want to speculate on her motivation when she\u2019s dealing with stuff that white commenters likely don\u2019t understand.", "I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll ever get her to agree with you there. \ud83d\ude05 She\u2019s worse about it with mens hair than womens. When she sees longish hair on men in general sometimes she\u2019ll say under her breath \u201cOmg that looks trashy af\u201d She seems to really take issue with cornrows on men. Like she thinks we\u2019ll get judged by people for having \u201cghetto ass hair\u201d so we just shouldn\u2019t do it. The fact that we live in an almost all white neighborhood probably is making her complex worse honestly.", "THISSSS but i think OP is a very very very light YTA for how he handled the situation i know he didn\u2019t mean to treat his mother like that. it was in the moment but i think it was meant and firm i think him and his mother should definitely talk to someone because if he does then the best will come for OP i guarantee you on that u/elizabeth_diamond_", "You are very young.", "saying a hair texture is challenging is not racist, not micro racist, not offensive, not micro offensive. Silky texture is challenging to afro...not offensive, is what it is. Super course hair is challenging to be in humid temps...not offensive. and absofuckinglutely not racist", "Yeah like I don\u2019t think so! Nobody at work gives af. But maybe when she was growing up it was considered unprofessional looking. Idk \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2642\ufe0f", "So your mom is antiblack in a way a lot of even non mixed people are. NTA and I\u2019m sorry that your mother is that way", "Jesus your mum sounds kinda fixated on this \"good hair\" situation. \n\nI have two kids with a Black American husband.  They both have totally different hair,  30F and 24M, one has her curls under control, and son has dreads and no 1 on the sides. \n\nBeing a boy he doea get the his hair done but not as often as his sister.\n\nDoes that affect the way I treat him, nope!! Do I care, nope. As he is figuring who he is - you mum should left you figure out who you are.\n\nAnd your hair is not a reflection of her parenting", "It is time to move out.", "Nope.  Nta. Your mom just found that hard boundary because she wouldn't listen to you.\n\nYou can let her know that you're sorry she is upset,  but you have feelings too and she never stopped long enough to see and accept YOUR feelings.\n\nThen ask her to apologize for not accepting your bodily autonomy, and to accept that negative comments about your hair are are just as bigoted as comments about skin color.  You didn't get to pick it.", "Oh. Heck. No. NTA!!!!!! \n\nIf you don\u2019t start setting boundaries NOW, she will be that MIL and mother who is intruding into your home unannounced whenever because \u2018she\u2019s your mom\u2019 and \u2018can\u2019. \n\nMy MIL is JUST like that, literally fighting w my partner to get his hair cut when it\u2019s not even an INCH of growth, and she dragged him to a woman\u2019s shop MONTHS ago and they BUTCHERED his curls and cut it in LAYERS,\n\nIt\u2019s growing out but he lost the curls :/ \n\nAnd just the other week she fought w him to trim his beard but he wanted to do it on his own time not when he was busy w a chore and she snapped at him. Then gave him an ultimatum to shave it off entirely or go to a barber with her just that minute. \n\nHe shaved off months of growth he was doing for the first time. \n\nAnd while he was shaving? She manipulated him into letting her giving him a haircut. So be on the watch for that as well unfortunately.", "Nah.....if you told her to stop and she didn't ..she's actively not listening and does what she wants....if she did that a lot since you were young...then I would understand your rage moment", "NTA\n\nYou set a healthy boundary and your mom did not respect that. Do *not* back-paddle on it. Stand your ground. It's *your* hair and she thinking that she's entitle to it just cause she's your mom is *way* out of line.\n\nETA: If anything *she* needs to apologise to you.", "You might also want to tell her that every time she complains that your hair isn't like a white person's hair, she's telling you that she wants to erase the blackness from you.  And that's about 50 kinds of wrong.  She needs to stop trying to make your hair \"white\" and undo you.", "Braiding my daughter's hair is one of the joys of my life.  She is 26.  I don't think OP's mom is coming from a good place if her touch is never gentle.  When it is an act of love, a kid of any age can tell.", "I am sorry that happened to you. Can you show her a utube video explaining how black people feel about there hair. There are lots of educational ones for white parents.  That might get her attention.", "It's  NOT HER CHOICE AND SHE NEEDS TO RESPECT your body autonomy.  Nta", "Yep, I can sympathize with her having brain weasels that tell her her children need to be well groomed 24/7 and that white-looking = neater. \n\nWere I loose sympathy is when it manifests into her being verbally and physically hurtful to her son."]}
