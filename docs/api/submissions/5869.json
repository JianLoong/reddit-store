My siblings both have wavy soft hair, but mine is a lot more wild and curly. I don\u2019t mind. I usually fro it out or cornrow it, it\u2019s never been an issue for me. But my mom can\u2019t stand it. She\u2019s always wants to pick at it, comb it out (hard, she\u2019s not gentle, so ouch), iron it. She nags me non stop to shave it and when I refuse she gets mad. She always compares my hair to my siblings and says \u201cWhy couldn\u2019t you just have hair like them two! Your hair will be the death of me!\u201d while she\u2019s angrily picking at it because she guilted me into letting her \u201cfix it\u201d for the 900th time. She says it\u2019s because she doesn\u2019t want people making fun of me, she\u2019s used that same excuse since I was little, but nobody has said anything to me about it ever. It\u2019s only ever been her that\u2019s had a problem with it.\n\nI don\u2019t want to make it seem like she\u2019s a bad mom or anything. She\u2019s not. It\u2019s just on this one thing she never lets up. Calmly explaining to her that I like my hair the way it is and can do it myself does no good, I\u2019ve tried. She thinks that my hair isn\u2019t truly just mine because she\u2019s my mom so it\u2019s also hers too. So finally this morning while I was getting ready for work I reached my breaking point. It\u2019s cornrowed right now and growing out slightly, I just gel it a little bit and it looks fine. But she sees me in the bathroom and she storms right in and says \u201cOh my god! Caleb (that\u2019s my name) It\u2019s out of control, let me fix it!\u201d I tell her it\u2019s fine I don\u2019t need her to fix it, but she says \u201cIt\u2019s not fine! You can\u2019t see the back! I can!\u201d I guess she found a few loose hairs in the back and she tried \u201cuntangling\u201d them and ends up pulling HARD and it was right on the back of my neck and that shit hurt a lot, and I finally just snapped. I turned around and yelled and cussed at her \u201cMom I said don\u2019t touch my fucking hair!!! Get tf off me!!\u201d She just stared at me stunned for a second and says that she was just trying to help but I wasn\u2019t having it at that point and I kept yelling to stay the fuck away from me! Don\u2019t touch my hair ever again and if she does it one more time I\u2019m packing up my shit and moving out (I\u2019m 18). She just stands there staring at me and then her eyes get all teary and she leaves. I finish getting ready and storm out of the house furious even though my shift doesn\u2019t start for another two hours. \n\nNow I\u2019m sitting in my car still fuming but also feeling really guilty and my sister\u2019s texting me telling me how bad I made mom cry and that I need to apologize because I went too far. And I want to apologize but I\u2019m just so sick of this shit and I\u2019m pretty sure if I don\u2019t take full blame and just allow things to continue the way they are she\u2019s not gonna accept my apology anyways. I feel so bad but I\u2019m just so frustrated too. I know I shouldn\u2019t have cussed at her though. \ud83d\ude1e\n\nEdited for formatting.", "created_utc": 1672241771, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zxckrd/aita_for_blowing_up_at_my_mom_for_messing_with_my/", "score": 173, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

My thing is this if you choose to have children with a person of another ethnicity take the time to learn about their culture so that you can raise your kids to understand and have respect of both parents culture. You not learning how to do black hair when you have black children is horrible and common. I have actually done some of the biracial young ladies hair in my neighborhood because their moms did not know how to attend to their hair and had these kids hair looking crazy.
