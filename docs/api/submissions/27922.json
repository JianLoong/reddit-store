It\u2019s been rough living under my parents roof for the first time in 4 years one of the biggest things we argue about is my diet. \n\nSo I have been on a body transformation journey since early April. Since then I\u2019ve dropped from about 190 to 160 as of this week. I\u2019ve done this by doing a lot of cardio, weight training and most importantly calorie/macro tracking. I buy my own groceries, cook my own food, and am entirely self sufficient when it comes to my diet. I ask nothing of my parents other than time to use the kitchen so I can meal prep. \n\nMy parents aren\u2019t supportive of this. They think what I\u2019m doing is unhealthy/dangerous which it isn\u2019t. Partially because they have struggled with weight loss and see my way of doing it as extreme. This causes contention. My dad always talks about how when he\u2019s a Marine and when he was in the best shape of his life he never did what I do. My mom always says I\u2019m too skinny and need to eat more which is typical mom behavior. Since they can\u2019t just mind their business about it, we argue a lot.\n\nTomorrow is my grandmothers 94th birthday and as much as I want to go, I don\u2019t feel comfortable for two reasons. The first being is that it\u2019s a 3 days trip out of state to see her, which means that I likely wont be able to stick as strictly fo my diet or workout routine as I need to. The second being is that I know would feel pressured to eat my family\u2019s food. It\u2019s all like southern comfort food, so some of the most delicious food that will make you incredibly fat.\nI know my aunts and uncles will make me feel bad and constantly try to convince me to eat and I don\u2019t want to deal with that pressure, plus the temptation since I know the food will be good.\n\nSo, I said I wouldn\u2019t be going. I explained to my parents why and they weren\u2019t happy. My dad said I was being ridiculous that I couldn\u2019t take 3 days off from my diet to see family and that in the long run 3 days won\u2019t hurt. I told him that 3 days would ruin a whole weeks worth of progress that I need to be making. I don\u2019t like taking cheat days because they always make me feel worse about myself and because currently I\u2019m still too fat to have a reason to have a cheat day.\n\nMy mom told me that I\u2019m being selfish and that this could easily be my grandmother\u2019s last birthday. I told her that other people weren\u2019t attending in person and were all gonna FaceTime her to see her and speak and I could do that.\n\nThey said that wasn\u2019t acceptable and that since I could go, I need to go. I said that if I do go, I\u2019m just not going to eat for 3 days straight and that I didn\u2019t want to do that so I wouldn\u2019t be going. I also mentioned that the don\u2019t know how to commit to weight loss so they should stop lecturing me on what I need to do for my body. We reached an impasse until they left this morning and I didn\u2019t.\n\nI talked to my brother about it and he told me that I was being a huge dick and I need to go to see them and apologize to my parents.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1696036280, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16vtfiy/aita_for_refusing_to_go_to_a_family_event_because/", "score": 1365, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your parents need to settle down and stop being on your back about your diet.

If what you are saying is true you are doing true dangers to your body.\n\nAlso if you want to be a healthy weight for a long time it takes a long time. Skipping meals helps in the short term to lose weight but it slows down the metabolism. Meaning, your body will start slowing down because it doesn't want to die. This is unproductive because a slow metabolism can cause you to gain weight again once you start eating normally again.\n\nYou are not the asshole for not wanting to go and your parents are not assholes for wanting you to go.

Your parents are worried for you.\n\nEdit: Ok so I misunderstood the context and didnt realize that you started at 190 in april and today are currently at 160. I thought you started at 190 at the begining of this week. The timing is a lot healthier for the time given I will leave what I stated above so the comments below me still make sense.\n\nHowever I would like to stay with the nobody is an asshole statement. You are not an asshole for not wanting to go to this birthday. If they want to accommodate for you, like offering a salad bar, that seems like a logical conclusion but because nobody cares about you enough to factor in your situation then I think it's far for you not to go.

I was a fitness nut, then had bad life circumstances, gained a lot of weight, and just got back to my old self. I also come from a southern family who don't think nor care about health/fitness. HOWEVER.\n\nHaving fluctuated with EDs and disordered eating, I want to ask- do you often skip social events because of your diet? Do you find yourself feeling isolated? Do you feel guilty or anxious when you skip one workout, have a treat? Do you spend a lot of mental time thinking about food? Can you eat a food without knowing exactly what's in it? Do you stress over \"safe\" foods? I am by no means diagnosing you, but your post rings of orthorexic thinking. \n\nDiets are not meant to be forever, or incredibly strict.

Balance is important.\n\nI fully understand just having ignorant family members and I don't mean to diminish that, but- for three days? For your family? Check in with yourself OP. It's insidious how easy these things can take over your life. I had to arbitrate my thoughts when I had to take off my routine... for a tropical vacation.

You are a 5'10 man at 160 pounds, that is a very good weight for your size, and some people your size sometimes need to be heavier to account for their height ! Everybody has a different body, and you do too. Talk to somebody, a doctor preferably, and maybe try and be a bit more positive with yourself.

They think what I\u2019m doing is unhealthy/dangerous which it isn\u2019t. Partially because they have struggled with weight loss and see my way of doing it as extreme. This causes contention. My dad always talks about how when he\u2019s a Marine and when he was in the best shape of his life he never did what I do. My mom always says I\u2019m too skinny and need to eat more which is typical mom behavior. Since they can\u2019t just mind their business about it, we argue a lot.\n\nTomorrow is my grandmothers 94th birthday and as much as I want to go, I don\u2019t feel comfortable for two reasons. The first being is that it\u2019s a 3 days trip out of state to see her, which means that I likely wont be able to stick as strictly fo my diet or workout routine as I need to. The second being is that I know would feel pressured to eat my family\u2019s food. It\u2019s all like southern comfort food, so some of the most delicious food that will make you incredibly fat.\nI know my aunts and uncles will make me feel bad and constantly try to convince me to eat and I don\u2019t want to deal with that pressure, plus the temptation since I know the food will be good.\n\nSo, I said I wouldn\u2019t be going. I explained to my parents why and they weren\u2019t happy. My dad said I was being ridiculous that I couldn\u2019t take 3 days off from my diet to see family and that in the long run 3 days won\u2019t hurt. I told him that 3 days would ruin a whole weeks worth of progress that I need to be making. I don\u2019t like taking cheat days because they always make me feel worse about myself and because currently I\u2019m still too fat to have a reason to have a cheat day.\n\nMy mom told me that I\u2019m being selfish and that this could easily be my grandmother\u2019s last birthday. I told her that other people weren\u2019t attending in person and were all gonna FaceTime her to see her and speak and I could do that.\n\nThey said that wasn\u2019t acceptable and that since I could go, I need to go. I said that if I do go, I\u2019m just not going to eat for 3 days straight and that I didn\u2019t want to do that so I wouldn\u2019t be going. I also mentioned that the don\u2019t know how to commit to weight loss so they should stop lecturing me on what I need to do for my body. We reached an impasse until they left this morning and I didn\u2019t.\n\nI talked to my brother about it and he told me that I was being a huge dick and I need to go to see them and apologize to my parents.\n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

You need to control it which means finding safe ways of venturing out, letting go every once in a while (since you aren\u2019t describing an allergy where this is not possible) and knowing it won\u2019t cause you long term harm as long as it is only every once in a while. Your grandmother\u2019s 94th birthday is an excellent reason to find a way to let go just for this event. You can still be careful, just not as in routine and structured as you otherwise have been.

You may become one though if you don\u2019t stop back and recognise this for what it is. Please, please look into help for your eating disorder. I struggled with anorexia and bulimia from my early teens to early twenties, and towards the end actually weighed the most I ever had - my throat was absolutely fucked from the constant spewing and so it hurt so much that I couldn\u2019t purge as much as I\u2019d binged. Yeah, ridiculously unhealthy, and I realised that it needed to stop. Rather than actually seek support from a health professional, I did a lot of research on nutrition. I found a strict programme that I could follow that focused on a healthy diet and began an exercise routine that I genuinely enjoyed and made me feel great. I adapted it into a stricter version for myself. I got into the best shape of my life, and felt so strong and generally healthy, and literally everyone was telling me how amazing I looked and how much happier I seemed. Until they weren\u2019t.. because I wasn\u2019t really seeing them. Going out for dinner freaked me out because I didn\u2019t have control over what was going into my food, and in my mind one singular bad meal could send me into a whole spiral of binging then purging and things just being awful again. I was soon skipping everything, not even able to stomach the thought of having one gin and soda after work on a Friday with my lovely colleagues because that became too many additional calories. I stopped going into the office as often because people were starting to look a lot less convinced at my varying excuses for only having \u2018leaves\u2019 again while my weight was dropping quite drastically. But it was okay, because I was being super healthy right? I mean I was only technically a little underweight and I felt great, right? It took a literal intervention from both friends and family for me to realise how much I had isolated myself and let my obsession with control over food take over literally my entire life, and to finally seek support from a professional for my orthorexia. I don\u2019t think that you are an AH per se, because it\u2019s bloody difficult when you are in denial about your issue and you feel frustrated that people are trying to interfere in your health journey but honestly trust me, if the people closest to you in your life are that concerned, they probably have cause to be. And you should probably take a long hard look at the impact that you are not only going to have on yourself if you keep going with convincing yourself that missing a 3 day event to celebrate your 94 grandmother is a totally normal thing to do for the sake of a diet, but the impact that you\u2019re going to have on people around you. It\u2019s so, so hard to see someone that you care about making themselves sick and being completely in denial about it. Don\u2019t underestimate the impact that your illness has on your loved ones. You know that you could do this trip and still be healthy - as others have suggested, small portions, take healthy snacks, continue working out while you are away. The fact that you would rather not eat for three days, and you state this to your family in such a manner when they express their concerns, only serves to heighten their worry and the obviousness that you do have a serious issue.

I am an almost 40 year old woman who has struggled with her weight her entire adult and late-teen life.

All the documentaries, all the books, all the professional advice, courses, etc. Plus, my mother is a pediatric nutritionist. I have lost 70 lbs and am exactly 35 lbs from my healthy weight goal, as per the doctors' advice. I started this because I have young children and a husband, and last year, my blood work started showing early signs of effects obesity was having on my body. Nothing major yet, but enough of a wake-up call that I decided I should do this while I'm still young. Anyway, I've lost this weight over the course of over a year so that it will stick for the rest of my life. My diet also doesn't allow for \"cheat days\" so much, but I can still eat foods I enjoy in a healthy, natural way. My exercise regimen also calls for movement every single day, but with a sort of down time day in between with simple things like walks and floor barre pilates to rest my body. However, I have never ever missed a single family function, vacation, or important event due to my restrictive diet and exercise regimen. You can absolutely teach yourself how to select foods that work in ANY situation, and make any space work for exercise. It's something you learn with research, time, and experience. You're still very young and you'll learn more and more as you go (shoot, I still do).  \n\n\nI'm mentioning all of this for a reason. I'm doing this all at the advice of medical professionals and because I was actually obese, not just a slight bit overweight. YOU WORRY ME!

Your weight for your height, even with a small frame, doesn't sound terribly healthy. It may be on the low end of your healthy BMI, but you shouldn't be still restricting. So long as you input and output around the same calories, your weight will maintain. And light-to-moderate cardio exercise each day OR heavy exercise a couple of times a week will be more than enough to maintain, too.  \n\n\nYou should NOT be missing family functions like this. To us outsiders, and your family alike, this is addictive and abnormal behavior. You really ought to seek help. I don't think you're being an AH, I think you have mental issues going on right now. And that's ok! We all have our demons to battle. It's how you handle them that counts. Like I said, you're very young still, and you can still find a good balance for the rest of your life.
