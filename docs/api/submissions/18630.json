I always usually wear tank tops and shorts/sweatpants because they're comfy unless it's winter. I've always worn it since the first day we moved in together, but recently he told me he's not comfortable seeing me wearing a tank top. He said I shouldn't wear it around the house or wear something really sexy just because he's gay and won't be attracted to it.\n\nI never dressed this way because of that reason, they're just.. my pyjamas. I told him this and he said I still should be conscious because he doesn't want to see my boobs every time he's home, he's uncomfortable with it.\n\nI didn't know that it had bothered him, I thought he's okay with it because we've been living together for a year now. So I apologized and said I'd wear something that covers up more, but then I was thinking our conversation again and I find it weird that I'm unable to wear what I want in my own house. Plus the tank tops weren't like lingerie, they're cotton -- not even with spaghetti straps.\n\nAnyway, I still wear the tank top sometimes because it gets hot, and he said I was being homophobic for wearing the tank top around him, he said: \"I'm not attracted to your body, so stop trying to flirt with me. And just because I'm gay, doesn't mean you can wear whatever you want around me. I'm still a man.\" I wasn't trying to flirt with him! he's gay, why would I flirt with him?\n\nSo AITA for this? If there's something I'm not getting please do let me know, he's one of my best friends, that's why we moved in together.

It sounds like he's projecting something about his own insecurities. NTA. You're not wearing clothes FOR HIM, you're wearing them because they're comfortable FOR YOU. Maybe you should tell him to not wear shorts around you and see how he likes it.", "NTA- you can wear whatever you want. \nWhy is he thinking people dress a certain way for him? That\u2019s really narcissistic. \n\nIs there a friend or someone from his circle that\u2019s suddenly around the house that could\u2019ve said something about it?", "What in the absolute hell? No, you're NTA.   \n\n\nThis man is either not gay and is sexually attracted to you, and that realisation makes him uncomfortable (ENTIRELY HIS PROBLEM, by the by), or he IS gay but incredibly misogynistic; thinking women need to cover up FOR men or else they're actively trying to trap them with their feminine wiles, instead of, you know, living their damn life in comfort.", "NTA. This situation is sounding an alarm for me. Especially \u201cstop trying to flirt with me\u2026 I\u2019m still a man\u201d. \n\nHaving met some deeply troubled men in my own life, this begs the question of whether you are safe with him? Please OP, tell someone else that he said this, and get their take. I don\u2019t like this situation for you AT ALL.", "NTA. You\u2019re not being homophobic, he\u2019s being misogynistic. He\u2019s assuming that a woman wearing comfortable clothes that he somehow perceives would be sexy is flirting with him. He\u2019s being ridiculous and making a lot of assumptions about a person who wants to be comfortable in their own home - not everything is about a woman trying to land a man. Good lord.", "As another gay man, your roommate is just really weird. In no way is a tank top homophobic or considered flirting with him. The fuck? And why does he think you, let alone anyone, is wearing clothes for him? \n\nNot really sure why he thinks that. Maybe he\u2019s bi and is projecting? Either way, keep wearing what you\u2019re wearing. It\u2019s fine.\n\nNTA", "NTA because, and I want you to read this several times over, **any person fully comfortable with their sexuality will not behave the way your roommate is.** Your roomie has sexuality conflicts he is not addressing; do what you have been doing. I've never met a gay man who gave two fucks about the chest of a woman.", "NTA. Its your home, your body, why is he concerned with what you choose to wear? He should explore why a tank top makes him uncomfortable.", "NTA. Also, your roommate may be bi.", "NTA. It is really odd that he thinks you\u2019re flirting with a gay man. If this is unfounded then I think perhaps he is feeling sexually confused and finding himself attracted to you.  He may be discovering he\u2019s bisexual.", "NTA\n\nOk. So. First of all, you should be entitled to wear whatever the fuck you want when you're home. Unless you're literally assaulting him with your nudity or like legit sexy lingerie he doesn't have much of a leg to stand on with that argument at all. Bodily autonomy is in fact a thing.\n\nThen... He's just acting weird. Like, it sounds as though he **is** somewhat attracted to you and it could be confusing him? Like he's going \"oh God I hate seeing your boobs all the time!\" (Because I kind of secretly like seeing them and that makes me feel weird). Obviously it's hard to say being a random stranger on the internet receiving a small slice of window into your living situation, but. I don't know. It's basically the frat bro who's secretly gay homophobic energy but in reverse? At least from my perspective. \n\nAnyway you have all the right to dress how you like and I'd probably want to have a serious, long discussion with him about why this has become an issue and how he's feeling about me if I were you.\n\nGood luck, I hope it resolves well!", "NTA. As a society, we need to get over the idea that women should accommodate men by dressing to make them comfortable because they are somehow unable to control themselves if we wear things that are too revealing. You have the right to wear what you want, especially in your own apartment. He is being weird and controlling. There is nothing homophobic about dressing a certain way unless you have homophobic words on your clothes or something. \n\n\"I'm still a man???\" That is never a justification for imposing any requirement on how someone else acts and behaves. You're not hurting him.", "NTA. If your body makes your roommate uncomfortable, that\u2019s a him problem. He needs to explore why he feels it necessary to police the bodies of the women around him.", "NTA and you roommate is acting very weird. This is your home and you are not wearing anything inappropriate that you wouldn't open the door if someone rings on it, right? Maybe have an honest conversation with him where you explain that you are -not- trying to flirt or interested in him romantically and you are well aware of his sexual orientation, but he should also stop acting as if you can't show a shoulder around him without him objectifying you.", "NTA\n\nIf he were straight and told you to cover up more because you look like a slut, everyone would tell him to shut up. Just because he's gay doesn't mean he gets to police what you wear.", "OK, your roommate makes a big error in the way he's thinking: you are NOT wearing this to flirt with him. You dress like this because it's comfy, and that is your right.\n\nHe's a big ass of a man: Women Don't Dress To Attract Men. They don't dress a certain way because 'they want attention' and they don't dress a certain way because 'they want to be touched' or anything even remotely close to that mindset.\n\nGosh, if boobs bother him, he's going to have a hard life. All women have boobs after all. He'll be surrounded by boobs everywhere.\n\nNTA", "NTA- Him implying he\u2019s a \u201cman\u201d is only justifying the fact that he cannot control himself.  It\u2019s immature and gross that he can\u2019t not stop thinking about himself. If he won\u2019t give you another reason other than \u201cI\u2019m a man\u201d I think you should stand your ground and let him deal with it. He lives in a shared house, what does he expect? You should accommodate at a balance not for one person. \n\nHim saying your homophobic is a little bit weird. If you didn\u2019t say any homophobic comments or ware anything nasty on your shirt you cannot be considered homophobic. I think he\u2019s more of a boy than a man if he can\u2019t keep his d in his pants.", "NTA. \n\nIf this guy's so offended by the sight of a girl in a tank top, why is he living with a girl? Sounds to me like he's struggling with conflicting feelings about his own sexuality.\n\nFind a better roommate.", "Why the heck would he jump to that conclusion? You're just wearing what you're comfortable wearing around the house.\n\nNTA", "You can wear tank top wherever you want. The fact that he suddently has a problem with it screams that the top is not the issue here.\n\nNTA", "NTA, I think either your roommate isn't being entirely truthful about his sexuality (not *necessarily* for malicious reasons, just might be from a place of figuring his own sexuality out, but maybe not, just something to keep in mind), or has some internalized misogyny, or both", "NTA\n\nSo\u2026 what are the chances you can get a new roommate?", "NTA. Wear whatever you like and if he's uncomfortable with anything he can either not look or find somewhere else to live. For him calling you homophobic - how did he jump to that conclusion? - I'd want rid of him for that alone. His entitlement knows no limits. I'd be bringing out the most revealing clothing I had and see how he reacts. If he can learn to recognise his shitty attitude I'd drop things back a bit but seriously, no-one ever gets away with telling me what to wear. Oh fuck no!!", "NTA\n\nWhether your roommate is straight or gay doesn't really matter. This is your home and unless you're coming out in a bra or naked then you should be able to wear what you want. \n\nI understand that we all must be considerate about what makes people close to us uncomfortable, but what you wear in the comfort of your own home should not be something like that. The fact that he thinks you're trying to flirt just due to your clothing is also a bizarre thing. \n\nLet him know that you will wear what you feel comfortable with in your own home, that you're not encroaching on his personal space or anything and pyjamas are certainly not a flirtation tactic. I wonder if he thinks women in bikinis are flirting with him lol.\n\nSuch a bizarre thing to think. \n\nPerhaps you are not suited to be roommates and it may be worth considering not renewing the lease or discussing if you both want to find somewhere else to live/new roommates.", "INFO\n\nIs it possible your roommate is bisexual or pansexual?", "NTA you're just dressing comfortably in your own home. It's not like you're walking around naked or anything. He's very self-centered in thinking that this could only be about him \n\nIf it's been fine until recently then I'm wondering where he's getting this idea from. If you're otherwise stable with him it might be a good idea to talk about it further. You already explained that he has nothing to do with why you dress that way.  Maybe ask why he still thinks otherwise?\n\nSomething seems off and not-right here.", "NTA and now is a great time to exercise those communication skills!\n\nAs him what changed between last year and now. Ask why he thinks you\u2019re being flirty by wearing a tank top? Ask him why he\u2019s suddenly uncomfortable with the fact that you have boobs!", "NTA. He should get over himself.", "NTA. he's got a very warped idea of what flirting is.\n\nit is your home not just his, wear what you want. If he can't handle it that's on him.", "NTA\n\nLose the roommate, quick. It's going to escalate from here.", "?????? NTA tell him the world doesn\u2019t revolve around him", "So \u2018don\u2019t wear a tank top around me because I\u2019m NOT attracted to you.\u2019 ??", "INFO: does he ever go around without a shirt? If so, how is that any better than you wearing a tank top, according to his weird idea of \"really sexy\" clothes?  \n\n\nEither he's not as gay as he thinks he is, or there's some other issue going on that he's unfairly taking out on you. Tank tops on women aren't homophobic or overly provocative; this is a roommate problem, not a you problem.", "Nta. \n\nYou are wearing a tank top. You are not showing off anything. You are wearing clothes. You are not walking around butt naked.  \n\nHe has to get over himself.  \n\nBut if he's actually uncomfortable and you want to stay friends.

And if he says no-then call him on it as a \u201chim\u201d issue and not your problem to deal with. \n\nFrankly-even if you were walking around in booty shorts and a tube top, it\u2019s your house just as much as it is his.

You know that. He's being a pig.", "What kind of misogynistic thinking does he constantly struggle with daily?? You do things that make you comfortable, not to flirt with men or try to make you attractive. Just tell him he's not your type. NTA.", "Nta.  Your clothes are not about him.  As long as you are dressed enough to go out to get the mail - not a blatent distraction or too inappropriate to be seen by kids, it's not his concern..  He sounds  controlling.  Do not put up with having your rights taken away in your own home.", "Hmm from what he\u2019s saying sounds like he\u2019s still in the closet about his sexuality.

You\u2019re not being homophobic whatsoever. \n\nYour roommate is a special kind of AH too\u2026 Why would any reasonable human being assume a tank top is solely for their viewing pleasure as opposed to just what you wish to wear in your own fucking  house. \n\nThis is a hill to die on.

If I lived with a gay man (similar dynamic, I'm not attracted to him, he in theory could be attracted to me) and he was going around wearing banana hammocks and mesh shirts, I can see how it would make it me uncomfortable.\n\nNow that is different from comfort clothing like you are describing, unless...\n\nAre you sure there isn't something else about these clothes that could be offensive? I've known some women to wear shirts that were fairly transparent without even realizing it.", "Damn, your boobs are apparently so good they are making a gay man question his sexuality... NTA.", "It definitely seems possible roomate could be bi, doesn't like that idea, so he's asking OP to change her clothing rather than confront these uncomfortable feelings.\n\nNone of this is OP's fault (whether he's bi or not, a tank top is *not* lingerie)!

Lose the roommate.", "I have small boobs, don't even have cleavage. Also, your comment is gross. Are you saying women who have bigger boobs aren't allowed to wear tank tops? If they're allowed to wear it outside, why not inside?\n\nIf your response is \"You're not the only person living there\", well I'm not the only person alive in this world either yet I still wear tank tops outside and no one sees a problem with it.", "And not allow him to be shirtless because, even though he's gay, he could be trying to attract/flirt with her.", "JFC.

We're the B. We're a different thing than gay or straight.", "I would personally never refer to myself as gay and don't know any bi women who do, so this is a new one for me.

Apologies for assuming.", "ESH, but just a little (because communication is breaking down). He is sexually uncomfortable with what you are wearing. That's not your fault but he is communicating his discomfort. Hopefully he was respectful about it. But you are both heading the wrong direction.\n\nI don't like seeing family members nipples through their clothes. Sometimes it's hard not to notice them, then I feel awkward as I actively avoid looking at them. It's not even a sexual feeling so much as an embarrassment for noticing.\n\nNow flip the script. How much of his stiff package are you comfortable noticing on the regular. Even in a non sexual way. Casual nude, easy no go. What about wearing a thong or g-string? Speedos? Pants that are just too tight? Or shorts that hang just a little too short when he has one knee up? What if the line where he was most comfortable didn't quite make you comfortable?\n\nThat might not be an issue for you, but imagine being a woman that had that issue.\n\nI recommend sitting down and having an open conversation about it. You could probably be light-hearted and fun with it, but get down to specifics. Is it your shoulders, your neck? Is it your nipples? \"Ok, it's the nipples, I get that. What else has been an awkward distraction?\" What about side boob, cleavage, the way they jiggle? What about other stuff? Ankles, long legs, thighs? Am I ever flashing camel toe at you? Reverse camel toe? Is my asshole winking at you too?\n\nIt might just be specific tops. It might just be that you're not wearing a bra and he is never around women that aren't wearing one. Or maybe you should run around topless to desensitize him, fuck if I know.\n\nBut right now, you two are roommates, each other's comfort is important, and the only way to navigate that is with good communication.", "I feel like the roommate is low-key attracted to OP and doesn't know how to deal.", "Hell, I am a straight female who has two straight male roommates and this has never come up. I wear shorts and t-shirts with no bra around the house, even. Bro dude roommate wears these hideous cut off t-shirts to show off his arms. Nobody complains. Nobody hooks up, either. We're just adults about it.", "My daughter and I were just talking about how some gay men are incredibly misogynistic--and proudly so!", "It's a tank top. Just because it belongs to a woman, does not make it lady bits. It's showing her chest and arms. Not her boobs and nipples.", "What the hell kind of bizarre body policing/shaming shit is this?", "IKR?!?!\n\nHow dare she! As an owner of big boobs, how dare she try to police how I present MY boobs.", "This comment makes no sense. Gaslighting? Ableism? Where? She responded exactly to what you said and, if it matters, as another owner of big boobs, I found nothing wrong with it. There is nothing wrong with not wearing a bra no matter what your size, and there is nothing wrong with tank tops inside or outside the house. \n\nI actually believe there is nothing intrinsically wrong with going bare chested outdoors as well, women's breasts should not be sexualized, but I'll wait for society to catch up on that one. Google free the nipple - it's allowed in some cities.\n\nNone of what I wrote relates to my practice. I wear bras everywhere because I find them more comfortable but I wouldn't impose my preferences for myself on anyone else.", "He\u2019s objectifying her body. A practice which apparently transcends sexuality.", "Oh, I don't know. Just the WHOLE COMMENT! I'm still in shock over it. I might need to get therapy, or at least go cuddle one of my participation trophies. I'm really quite upset.", "It\u2019s misogyny. He\u2019s sexualizing her body because she\u2019s *gasp* showing skin.", "What\u2019s simultaneously amusing and exhausting is that statistically men are much more likely to interpret friendly behavior as flirting than women are.

Sometimes they do attract one\u2019s gaze. And often, that has nothing to do with actual sexual attraction. I think OP\u2019s roommate is having a hard time not looking, and he\u2018s having a hard time reconciling the visual attraction to her boobs with his sexuality. This is squarely a him problem. It\u2019s not her fault.", "I think you are getting bras and tank tops mixed up with each other, sweetie.", "LOL, I wish you knew my friend Quanna. She wears those mens white undershirt/tank tops. She has big boobs and the material is quite stretched. Not much left to the imagination.  I was thinking of her when I was reading the OP's description of what she was wearing, darling.", "I have big boobs. I see zero issue with her wearing that. If you think it's an issue, maybe go to therapy? Because that's not a normal thing to have an issue with. \n\nOp specifically states that it does not show anything. Therefore, her boobs are covered. Is that hard to figure out from the post, lovie?", "I wouldn\u2019t \u201ctalk\u201d to him about this. I would firmly state that you are allowed to choose your own clothing (*especially* in the heat), and that he has no control over you. And that he is making you uncomfortable. Anything else is sexist. Hold that line: that he is being sexist, don\u2019t play into the homophobic thing. Flip the tables back on him.\n\nHe sounds unhinged though, so improvise to do what\u2019s needed to be safe if needed, but I would start off being prepared to hold your ground. Don\u2019t give him an inch.", "Honey, I'm 62 and wore tank tops with no bra around guy (not gay) roommates all the time. Ask him why he's being a controlling sexist. Tell him that you pay rent and will wear whatever you want whenever you want as long as you're covered in fabric. If HE has an issue, HE needs to deal with it, not try to change you. You're equals and he has no right to try to change you just because he's gotten his panties in a twist. Why has he suddenly become so narcissistic that he thinks you're panting after him and trying to convert him? That's quite some ego he's got there. NTA", "I'm reading this as sarcasm now. Why'd you delete your original comment?\n\nEdit: It's still visible in her comment history in case anyone reading this is interested in the context.", "She\u2019s wearing her pajamas in her home. She\u2019s not treating him like a female roommate.", "Ok like legit this guy is instrumentalizing the very real homophobia that happens around us for completely misogynistic purpose. \n\nI\u2019m gay and being gay is not like you\u2019re  allergic to the female body, it\u2019s just that you like the male body and female just have no effect. \n\nYou\u2019re NTA and he is the asshole", "NTA. Some gay guys are very uncomfortable with women, to the point of being misogynistic, and honestly this seems like one of those situations. It is by no means homophobic to wear tank tops around him.", "First off, NTA.  But does roommate come from a very conservative family where pajamas were not worn in public areas?  Maybe he is just uncomfortable with that, if it's something that he was brought up to believe is inappropriate to the point of being indecent.  Even if he is gay, and it doesn't appeal to him, he feels that it is wrong, and he is uncomfortable with it, but lacks the insight to explain why.   \n\nOr he finds you very attractive, and doesn't know how to handle that.", "As long as you\u2019re covered, just throw on a sports bra and he has no complaint otherwise tell him to grow up", "YTA. Provably one of his male friends or boyfriends gets truned on by your clothes. If he is, as you said, \"one of your best friends\", just take in count his feelings about it. He is setting boundaries. It is not just your house. Is his too. Both need to be comfrortable, not just you because you are a woman.", "So the thing that stands out to me is,\n\n>he doesn't want to see my boobs every time he's home, he's uncomfortable with it.\n\nWhile he said other things that make him an AH, it's his home too and he also deserves to be comfortable.\n\nNow, it sounds like he's only asking you to not wear this one tank top that leaves nothing to the imagination. I personally don't think it's much to ask for a little courtesy when he's home. You even say that you were doing that, but still wear the tank top from time-to-time. Each time you wear it you tell him that he, and his feelings, don't matter. \n\nSo, I agree with the majority that he's the AH, but I think you're doing AH things too. ESH.", "NTA for wearing tank tops.\n\nHe was probably trying to find a reason to get you to stop by saying that it's homophobic, which it's not. He should have just stopped at \"it makes me uncomfortable\". \n\nThat being said, if he really is uncomfortable with it you should maybe look for tank tops with thicker straps, ones that have a higher neckline.  It is your house, but it's his too. Just as if something he wore made you uncomfortable  you're entitled to express that concern to him because he's in your space too. And you can expect that he'll wear something different out of courtesy. \n\nIf it's hot though he should understand and not get angry when you wear a short shirt. It's like if your roommate said \"i hate legs, never show your legs to me\", and then got angry when you wore shorts on a crazy hot day. People should dress according to the weather.  \n\nIt could be that he is just really uncomfortable with the female body because of his sexuality.  If that's the case, everything is even more entirely his fault. He should have known that if he got so uncomfortable just being in the same room with a woman's exposed shoulders that living with a woman wouldn't work out. \n\nYou tried to accommodate but he went and started trying to gaslight you. Maybe discuss with him that you don't think it's fair that you have to wear layers on a hot day. If he can't see your point and refuses to stop being controlling, then he should find alternative housing because it's his issue, not yours.", "NAH. It's not just your home. It's his too.", "Esh. \n\nHe\u2019s a dick and you live in a shared space and should give a mutual respect in shared spaces regardless. \n\nI\u2019ve lived with dudes as roommates and we understood minimum shorts/pants as we didn\u2019t wanna see each other in boxers. \n\nTreat the shared areas as though you just have a good friend around you wanna be modest for.

They use it to end any and all arguments. If you disagree with them or don't follow what they ask, you are homophobic.", "I don\u2019t think it\u2019s this. Sometimes boobs just attract the eyes, regardless of if the person is actually attracted to them in a sexual way. I can see where this might be difficult for someone who is firmly attracted to men.", "Shhh. Don\u2019t ruin OP's fantasies", "I don't have an issue with it. It's sleep wear. One reason she says it show's nothing is because she is wearing it. She doesn't see herself moving around in it. She may not notice that the arm hole shows her boobs when she leans down. Or if they are loose shorts that it shows all her business when she sits a certain way.  I was only saying that just because 1 person hasn't  a problem being seen a certain way doesn't mean that the person  seeing it is comfortable.", ">I came out of the closet only to find I was also stuck inside a wardrobe."]}
