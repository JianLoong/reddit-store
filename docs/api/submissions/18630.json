I always usually wear tank tops and shorts/sweatpants because they're comfy unless it's winter. I've always worn it since the first day we moved in together, but recently he told me he's not comfortable seeing me wearing a tank top. He said I shouldn't wear it around the house or wear something really sexy just because he's gay and won't be attracted to it.\n\nI never dressed this way because of that reason, they're just.. my pyjamas. I told him this and he said I still should be conscious because he doesn't want to see my boobs every time he's home, he's uncomfortable with it.\n\nI didn't know that it had bothered him, I thought he's okay with it because we've been living together for a year now. So I apologized and said I'd wear something that covers up more, but then I was thinking our conversation again and I find it weird that I'm unable to wear what I want in my own house. Plus the tank tops weren't like lingerie, they're cotton -- not even with spaghetti straps.\n\nAnyway, I still wear the tank top sometimes because it gets hot, and he said I was being homophobic for wearing the tank top around him, he said: \"I'm not attracted to your body, so stop trying to flirt with me. And just because I'm gay, doesn't mean you can wear whatever you want around me. I'm still a man.\" I wasn't trying to flirt with him! he's gay, why would I flirt with him?\n\nSo AITA for this? If there's something I'm not getting please do let me know, he's one of my best friends, that's why we moved in together. I'm not really sure what changed and what made him do this", "created_utc": 1685539051, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13wm2lv/aita_for_wearing_tank_tops_around_my_gay_roommate/", "score": 37, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It sounds like he's projecting something about his own insecurities. NTA. You're not wearing clothes FOR HIM, you're wearing them because they're comfortable FOR YOU. Maybe you should tell him to not wear shorts around you and see how he likes it.", "NTA- you can wear whatever you want. \nWhy is he thinking people dress a certain way for him? That\u2019s really narcissistic. \n\nIs there a friend or someone from his circle that\u2019s suddenly around the house that could\u2019ve said something about it?", "What in the absolute hell? No, you're NTA.   \n\n\nThis man is either not gay and is sexually attracted to you, and that realisation makes him uncomfortable (ENTIRELY HIS PROBLEM, by the by), or he IS gay but incredibly misogynistic; thinking women need to cover up FOR men or else they're actively trying to trap them with their feminine wiles, instead of, you know, living their damn life in comfort.", "NTA. This situation is sounding an alarm for me. Especially \u201cstop trying to flirt with me\u2026 I\u2019m still a man\u201d. \n\nHaving met some deeply troubled men in my own life, this begs the question of whether you are safe with him? Please OP, tell someone else that he said this, and get their take. I don\u2019t like this situation for you AT ALL.", "NTA. You\u2019re not being homophobic, he\u2019s being misogynistic. He\u2019s assuming that a woman wearing comfortable clothes that he somehow perceives would be sexy is flirting with him. He\u2019s being ridiculous and making a lot of assumptions about a person who wants to be comfortable in their own home - not everything is about a woman trying to land a man. Good lord.", "As another gay man, your roommate is just really weird. In no way is a tank top homophobic or considered flirting with him. The fuck? And why does he think you, let alone anyone, is wearing clothes for him? \n\nNot really sure why he thinks that. Maybe he\u2019s bi and is projecting? Either way, keep wearing what you\u2019re wearing. It\u2019s fine.\n\nNTA", "NTA because, and I want you to read this several times over, **any person fully comfortable with their sexuality will not behave the way your roommate is.** Your roomie has sexuality conflicts he is not addressing; do what you have been doing. I've never met a gay man who gave two fucks about the chest of a woman.", "NTA. Its your home, your body, why is he concerned with what you choose to wear? He should explore why a tank top makes him uncomfortable.", "NTA. Also, your roommate may be bi.", "NTA. It is really odd that he thinks your flirting with a gay man. If this is unfounded then I think perhaps he is feeling sexually confused and finding himself attracted to you.  He may be discovering he\u2019s bisexual.", "NTA\n\nOk. So. First of all, you should be entitled to wear whatever the fuck you want when you're home. Unless you're literally assaulting him with your nudity or like legit sexy lingerie he doesn't have much of a leg to stand on with that argument at all. Bodily autonomy is in fact a thing.\n\nThen... He's just acting weird. Like, it sounds as though he **is** somewhat attracted to you and it could be confusing him? Like he's going \"oh God I hate seeing your boobs all the time!\" (Because I kind of secretly like seeing them and that makes me feel weird). Obviously it's hard to say being a random stranger on the internet receiving a small slice of window into your living situation, but. I don't know. It's basically the frat bro who's secretly gay homophobic energy but in reverse? At least from my perspective. \n\nAnyway you have all the right to dress how you like and I'd probably want to have a serious, long discussion with him about why this has become an issue and how he's feeling about me if I were you.\n\nGood luck, I hope it resolves well!", "NTA. As a society, we need to get over the idea that women should accommodate men by dressing to make them comfortable because they are somehow unable to control themselves if we wear things that are too revealing. You have the right to wear what you want, especially in your own apartment. He is being weird and controlling. There is nothing homophobic about dressing a certain way unless you have homophobic words on your clothes or something. \n\n\"I'm still a man???\" That is never a justification for imposing any requirement on how someone else acts and behaves. You're not hurting him.", "NTA. If your body makes your roommate uncomfortable, that\u2019s a him problem. He needs to explore why he feels it necessary to police the bodies of the women around him.", "NTA and you roommate is acting very weird. This is your home and you are not wearing anything inappropriate that you wouldn't open the door if someone rings on it, right? Maybe have an honest conversation with him where you explain that you are -not- trying to flirt or interested in him romantically and you are well aware of his sexual orientation, but he should also stop acting as if you can't show a shoulder around him without him objectifying you.", "NTA\n\nIf he were straight and told you to cover up more because you look like a slut, everyone would tell him to shut up. Just because he's gay doesn't mean he gets to police what you wear.", "OK, your roommate makes a big error in the way he's thinking: you are NOT wearing this to flirt with him. You dress like this because it's comfy, and that is your right.\n\nHe's a big ass of a man: Women Don't Dress To Attract Men. They don't dress a certain way because 'they want attention' and they don't dress a certain way because 'they want to be touched' or anything even remotely close to that mindset.\n\nGosh, if boobs bother him, he's going to have a hard life. All women have boobs after all. He'll be surrounded by boobs everywhere.\n\nNTA", "NTA- Him implying he\u2019s a \u201cman\u201d is only justifying the fact that he cannot control himself.  It\u2019s immature and gross that he can\u2019t not stop thinking about himself. If he won\u2019t give you another reason other than \u201cI\u2019m a man\u201d I think you should stand your ground and let him deal with it. He lives in a shared house, what does he expect? You should accommodate at a balance not for one person. \n\nHim saying your homophobic is a little bit weird. If you didn\u2019t say any homophobic comments or ware anything nasty on your shirt you cannot be considered homophobic. I think he\u2019s more of a boy than a man if he can\u2019t keep his d in his pants.", "NTA. \n\nIf this guy's so offended by the sight of a girl in a tank top, why is he living with a girl? Sounds to me like he's struggling with conflicting feelings about his own sexuality.\n\nFind a better roommate.", "Why the heck would he jump to that conclusion? You're just wearing what you're comfortable wearing around the house.\n\nNTA", "You can wear tank top wherever you want. The fact that he suddently has a problem with it screams that the top is not the issue here.\n\nNTA", "NTA, I think either your roommate isn't being entirely truthful about his sexuality (not *necessarily* for malicious reasons, just might be from a place of figuring his own sexuality out, but maybe not, just something to keep in mind), or has some internalized misogyny, or both", "NTA\n\nSo\u2026 what are the chances you can get a new roommate?", "NTA. Wear whatever you like and if he's uncomfortable with anything he can either not look or find somewhere else to live. For him calling you homophobic - how did he jump to that conclusion? - I'd want rid of him for that alone. His entitlement knows no limits. I'd be bringing out the most revealing clothing I had and see how he reacts. If he can learn to recognise his shitty attitude I'd drop things back a bit but seriously, no-one ever gets away with telling me what to wear. Oh fuck no!!", "NTA\n\nWhether your roommate is straight or gay doesn't really matter. This is your home and unless you're coming out in a bra or naked then you should be able to wear what you want. \n\nI understand that we all must be considerate about what makes people close to us uncomfortable, but what you wear in the comfort of your own home should not be something like that. The fact that he thinks you're trying to flirt just due to your clothing is also a bizarre thing. \n\nLet him know that you will wear what you feel comfortable with in your own home, that you're not encroaching on his personal space or anything and pyjamas are certainly not a flirtation tactic. I wonder if he thinks women in bikinis are flirting with him lol.\n\nSuch a bizarre thing to think. \n\nPerhaps you are not suited to be roommates and it may be worth considering not renewing the lease or discussing if you both want to find somewhere else to live/new roommates.", "INFO\n\nIs it possible your roommate is bisexual or pansexual?", "NTA you're just dressing comfortably in your own home. It's not like you're walking around naked or anything. He's very self-centered in thinking that this could only be about him \n\nIf it's been fine until recently then I'm wondering where he's getting this idea from. If you're otherwise stable with him it might be a good idea to talk about it further. You already explained that he has nothing to do with why you dress that way.  Maybe ask why he still thinks otherwise?\n\nSomething seems off and not-right here.", "NTA and now is a great time to exercise those communication skills!\n\nAs him what changed between last year and now. Ask why he thinks you\u2019re being flirty by wearing a tank top? Ask him why he\u2019s suddenly uncomfortable with the fact that you have boobs!", "NTA. He should get over himself.", "NTA. he's got a very warped idea of what flirting is.\n\nit is your home not just his, wear what you want. If he can't handle it that's on him.", "NTA\n\nLose the roommate, quick. It's going to escalate from here.", "?????? NTA tell him the world doesn\u2019t revolve around him", "So \u2018don\u2019t wear a tank top around me because I\u2019m NOT attracted to you.\u2019 ??", "INFO: does he ever go around without a shirt? If so, how is that any better than you wearing a tank top, according to his weird idea of \"really sexy\" clothes?  \n\n\nEither he's not as gay as he thinks he is, or there's some other issue going on that he's unfairly taking out on you. Tank tops on women aren't homophobic or overly provocative; this is a roommate problem, not a you problem.", "Nta. \n\nYou are wearing a tank top. You are not showing off anything. You are wearing clothes. You are not walking around butt naked.  \n\nHe has to get over himself.  \n\nBut if he's actually uncomfortable and you want to stay friends.  You should listen to him and start wearing more around the house.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

He has no right to dictate what you wear in your own home.   \n\n\nBut, if you think he's sincerely upset by it, you could try sitting him down and asking to talk, because his reasons as conveyed by you sound very confusing.

OP shouldn't have to cover up just because her allegedly gay roommate can't handle a plain ol' tank top. That's not provocative in any way, and it's HIS problem, not hers.", "Hmm. \n\nCould he be confused and questioning about his sexuality around you? I mean.. sexuality can be fluid.

Like.. before you were living together, did he ever mention this?", "I said nta.  It's her house. She is not showing off anything. \n\nBut if he is really uncomfortable with it.

I want to talk to him about this, but I just need to do it calmly and collect my thoughts first\n\nbut I was more relaxed in the way I dress because I'm comfortable around him and never thought he'd do anything to me, I never thought this behavior could be seen as homophobic though, so I wonder if this is what made him think this way", "nope, never. I actually sometimes wear more revealing clothes outside", "Just make sure you know: It\u2019s not homophobic in any way! I can\u2019t even think of 1 reason why it would be. \n\nBut yeah.. you should talk to him to understand why he would say something like this. Don\u2019t let him manipulate you.", "It's not homophobic. Don't let him talk you into believing that it is. If you're going to have a conversation with him, you should ask him if clothing choices mean the girl was asking for it.

His mindset in regards to women is toxic and he needs to see someone about it. Also I should add because my brother is this way: there's a difference between being gay because you're attracted to the same sex and being gay because you hate the opposite sex. he sounds like the later", "Alright.\n\nA lot of other folks have already pointed out that your roommate might be questioning his sexuality. That\u2019s a rough position to be in. Treating you poorly is no excuse for this, but it might be a factor. \n\nIt\u2019s been my experience that people are aren\u2019t actually upset with the thing they\u2019re blaming. \n\nSo for example, someone is jealous of someone else\u2019s partner. It might show up as the jealous person putting them down, when what\u2019s really happening is  the jealous person is afraid of \u201closing out\u201d, or that they\u2019re \u201cunlovable\u201d. It\u2019s never an excuse for poor behaviour, but people have a hard time dealing with self doubt and insecurities. \n\nWhat I\u2019m saying is, I don\u2019t think this is about tank-tops. \n\nIs he wrong weird in other ways? Like, out of the ordinary? More anxious? Upset? Etc? Is he being weird in your mutual group of friends? Or just at home? If he\u2019s only doing this when you\u2019re alone, he knows it\u2019s wrong. \n\nIs he worried that if you\u2019re looking fine, his dates will be more attracted to you?"]}
