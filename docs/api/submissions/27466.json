It gets more fun if/when you have children.    \n\nYou were with your parents last year for Christmas, this year you will be with them but a day or so later.  Next year you and your boyfriend plan to be with them and have a late Christmas with his parents.\n\nThis is a normal part of couple life.  \n\nYour parents may need time to adjust to the new normal.  I understand that due to the past they may be concerned that you are falling into a new relationship where they will not see you again so all you can do is reassure them that you and your BF will be there at X date.", "NTA- you are an adult in a relationship. Your parents will have to accept you have other commitments.", "NTA. I understand your parents might be sad but you said you\u2019re gonna alternate so they will have Christmas with you next year.", "Hello from Essex as well :)\n\nBut definitely NTA.  It's so, for want of a better word, \"political\" for so many families.  So and so has to spend X amount on so and so's nephew because his mother spent Y amount on your next door neighbour's dog.   And many more things equally as ridiculous :)\n\nMost parents would feel a little sad if their children weren't around at Christmas though, but that's natural and it's certainly not your fault.\n\nYou've given them plenty of advance notice and you're going to do Christmas again with them when you get back.   Personally, I'd make a big stink out of the day you're going to have with them after you get back just to try and change their mood about it.\n\nThey might try and talk you in to doing \"proper\" Christmas with them but a gentle reminder that that won't be happening will be all you need.", "NTA at all, I imagine 99% of relationships come across this issue. I\u2019m sure your parent had this issue too but they either don\u2019t remember or have chosen to forget it. \n\nAlternate where you are each year, they\u2019ll get over it. Or just spend Christmas the two of you, which sounds like you\u2019d enjoy the most anyway.", "You're an adult! Maybe reason new year's eve with them. As long as you call it shouldn't be an issue", "NTA", "NTA - You are allowed to choose what you want to do, it's not anyone else's place to tell you where to spend your Christmas", "NTA - you are an adult and you get to choose where you spend holidays, or any days for that matter.\n\nJust make sure you pencil some around holiday time for \"just you and your parents\" to let them know you still care.  It is hard watching your kids grow up and move out.", "You are an adult. Your parents cannot expect you home every Christmas. They will learn to manage their disappointment. \n\nNTA", "NTA \n\nYou parents have the right to feel sad about it. But they don't have to make you feel guilty because of it. You obviously care about everyone and it's not an easy choice for you, but your parents should want what's best for you and if that's what makes you happy, they need to put their feelings aside. Especially if you're going to do Christmas again with them only a couple of days after that.", "NTA. This is how it works. Someone will always be upset.", "NTA. \n\n>I don't know how to do it. Either way, someone is going to be upset.\n\nIt's as if you don't matter. They need to get used to the idea that you can do what you want.\n\n>I hate the pressure and the presents but everyone else likes it and it's not about me so I'm trying to do my best for everyone.\n\nTry to take control of it for you and your boyfriend.", "With our children, they know we would love to have them for Christmas but accept they also need to consider their partner's family. It is much more enjoyable if all guests are there by choice.\n\nHaving been in your parents' position of seeing one of their child in an unhealthy relationship and health issues within the family, I can also understand their position. I know I have a tendency to catastrophic thinking and have to be firm with myself not to put my concerns onto others. \"What if this relationship is worse than the last and we never see her again?\". \"Will X even be alive for Christmas next year?\". My family should not be forced to pander to this sort of nonsense but be free to live their life as they choose.  I knew someone who had been told that due to the state of his heart and lungs, he had maybe 6 months left but managed to have more than 10 last Christmases.\n\nYou are being fair and reasonable to all concerned. Christmas is far enough away that your parents would not be left with too much food to consume themselves or made major plans that cannot be changed. You could spend extra time with them during the run up to Christmas but stick to your plans and have a great time.", "NAH However, it isn't actually fair unless you give your parents New Years Day and an equally long visit. And then next year, his family gets New Years Day, and yours gets Christmas day. This way, everyone gets an actual holiday with their family instead of just part of the day people usually eat leftovers on.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
