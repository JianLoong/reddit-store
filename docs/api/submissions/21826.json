I (16M) was the result of a teen pregnancy. My dad and my birthmother were 19 when I was born, so obviously, things weren't exactly easy on them. I don't know the specifics, my dad just said that \u201cit all got too much for her\u201d, and honestly, I don't care about her reasons, but basically, my birthmother left me and my dad when I was two. He met my mom two years later and I started calling her mom when I was like, six I wanna say, but really, I've called her that for as long as I can remember. She's been there for me for basically my whole life, even when I was a brat to her.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow, a few weeks ago, my birthmother started contacting my dad because she wants to have a relationship with me. I immediately pointblank refused. I don't care about her. If I was a bit younger, maybe I'd think differently, but as it is right now, I don't get why she suddenly pops in out of nowhere. I don't need or want her in my life.My dad still told me to give her a shot, cause you never know or whatever, so I gave in and met her for coffee. We sat down, got our drinks, did small talk about how I am, how I'm doing in school, etc. And honestly, it wasn't that bad at first, until she said that \u201cIt must have been difficult not to have my real mom in my life\u201d. And I told her to back up, because my real mom had been in my life since I was four. She tried to explain that she \u201cdidn't mean it like that\u201d, but I didn't care by that point, told her that my REAL mom didn't run away when things got tough, and left.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMaybe I was a bit mean, but I honestly don't feel like I was an asshole. She doesn't get to be gone for 14 years and still claim to be my \u201creal mom\u201d. My dad and a few of my friends think I was too harsh and that I should have given her a chance to explain.So, any thoughts on this? I still don't think I did anything wrong.", "created_utc": 1688974759, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14vn4am/aita_for_blowing_off_my_birthmother/", "score": 143, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She tried to explain that she \u201cdidn't mean it like that\u201d, but I didn't care by that point, told her that my REAL mom didn't run away when things got tough, and left.\"\n\nYou were right to correct her about who your real mom is. And you were justified in calling her out. No one should try to pressure you about giving her a chance to explain. Your feelings are valid.  If you want to give her another chance, that's your choice and no one else's.", "NTA \n\nAs someone who is adopted I can totally understand where you are coming from.\nYou have a mom who loves you and stuck by you then some random blows in and expects you to allow her to move right in.She made her bed when she bailed out. You owe her nothing.", "NTA.\n\nIf you want a relationship with her it\u2019s on your terms. You\u2019re absolutely right to stipulate a clear boundary, she\u2019s not your mom, she doesn\u2019t get to call herself your mom, you already have a mom. Her role is as of yet \u201cundefined\u201d. You\u2019re under absolutely no obligation to tiptoe around her feelings or to allow her to use you to feed a sudden maternal instinct now that it\u2019s convenient for her. \n\nWhatever decision you make in regard to her is the right one. Good luck.", "NTA. Your birthmother appears to want a relationship with you now, but obviously she still doesn't understand how horrible her behavior in the past was, when she left you. She probably didn't mean her words in a nasty way, but I admire your open and honest reaction about who you consider your real mother.\n\nAs to your father, understandably that he wants you to give your birthmother the chance of a meaningful contact, but if you don't feel like it, you don't have any obligations regarding her.\n\nYou could more or less diplomatically tell your father that you tried, but that \"it all got too much for you\" (almost the same words as he defended the earlier behavior of your birthmother).  You could also say that if later on, you'd like to meet with her again, you'll take the initiative and that for now, you trust that she'll stay out of your life.", "NTA. 'Nuff said.", "NTA.\n\nBut I wouldn't write off giving it another go if you want to - it sounds like she might have been trying to say it was difficult because of what I did, working up to apology.\n\nI am so glad you had your real mom all these years! It might be worth talking to her about this. Telling her she is your real mom too will mean a lot.", "I, too, have adoptive and birth mothers, although I didn't meet BM until much later in life, after AM was dead,\n\nI think that your BM spoke clumsily and stepped on an emotional land mine, and I expect she'd like to have that back, if she could. But 16 is rough age for mothers and daughters at the best of times, and this isn't the best of circumstances. I'd urge you not to write her off for good, but maybe tell her, or at worst allow your dad to pass on the message that this isn't the right time for an introduction, but you're open to the idea of another try in a few years.", "Nta\n\nYou dont owe her anything", "NTA\nIt's your choice if you want her or not in your life. Also 14 years passed so it's obvious you won't consider her your real mom, because a mom is not the one who gives birth to you, but the one who raise you.", "NTA. Bio mom was essentially a surrogate. Did she really expect to bring up her absence without an emotional reaction for you and then dis on the woman who stood by you when she didn't? She doesn't understand human beings then. \nA real mom is one who sticks by you. You already have one.", "NAH.   Wow!  I could have written this 30 years ago which is when I had virtually the same experience as you just had.    You don't want a relationship with your birth mother; neither did I.   Your birthmother wants a relationship with you; so did mine.  I met her in person once and never had contact with her again after that one in person meeting.   All rather awkward but no assholes.   Your Dad and your few friends can disagree with your decision but they absolutely must respect it.  It is YOUR choice if you wish to have a relationship with your birth mother and no one else's.", "For me your not, maybe you should have talk with your father about your sentiment before met her.

Sounds like you have a fantastic mom and you should stick up for her! Harsh or not your bio mother needed to hear it!", "NTA. We all have choices. It was your biological mother's choice to leave your Dad alone to raise you. Now it is your choice to decide who you want in your life. Do not feel obligated to sustain a relationship with your biological mother.", "NTA. Maybe it's because I'm old and cynical, but isn't it convenient how OP's egg donor conveniently starts wanting a relationship with him now that he's 16, practically an adult, and all of the work of raising a child is out of the way?\n\nAnd for her to start with, \"It must have been so hard for you without me there\" (yes, she meant HER), and not start first with a profuse apology for abandoning him? Almost like she was hoping he'd gush over how much he missed her? Nope. \n\nOP, you gave her a chance, and in the future you can try again if you want, but that woman needs a shot in the arm of humility before she gets that chance again.", "NTA. I'm adopted and my brith-siblings found me on FB when I was 28. They kind of pushed (in a good way) to meet. But at some point they started talking about their family (my birth-family) as \"our\", referring to their kids as nieces/nephews, grand parents as \"our grandparents\" etc; And I had to, as gently as I could, tell them none of them are my family. That I am happy to know they exist and are well, that we can meet a few times here and there when opportunity arises, but that they are not my family, I already have one.\n\nI want to believe that your birth-mum was trying to speak more about herself, and maybe, in her way, apologizing. But you were NTA for calling her out. Maybe the relationship is something you can revisit, at your own pace. But those 14 years are gone, and she will not be your \"mum\", try as she may want to.", "Right or wrong, it is your choice.  Only the person who went through can make the decision like that.\n\nShe is your biological mother but that is it.  She was not there in your most important formative year as a child.\n\nBut without hearing her side of story I would say NAH", "I\u2019m in the opposite position in that my birth mother does not want to know me and very much does not want me to know about her.\n\nI just have to take it. I can\u2019t force a relationship where the other party doesn\u2019t want one and likewise your BM is just going to have to deal with it no matter how hard she might find it.\n\nI would ask you to not burn all your bridges. Say that \u2018at this time\u2019 you have no wish to meet or have any relationship with her. Your outlook at 16 might not be the same at 26 or 36.", "NAH of course you are hurt. However, you are nit picking over her word choice, almost like you were maybe looking for a reason to reject her. \n\nYes, \"birth mom\" was probably the more technically correct term. However, lots of people say \"real mom\" to refer to the birth mom. \n\nAnd, clearly it was hard for you when she left. She was acknowledging that. You don't know the circumstances of why she left. Sometimes the absolute best thing someone can do for their child is to leave. Often, it is a gut wrenching decision, not the easy way out. Maybe there were mental health issues involved. You won't know until you give her a chance to explain herself. \n\nI am not saying you have to just pretend the last 14 years never happened. However, I think it is worth hearing her out. And cut her some slack on word choice. I seriously doubt she meant any harm by what she said. It is a common way to refer to the person who gave birth to you.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Maybe this was a good thing to establish how you feel about the situation early on so your egg donor understands where the boundaries will be. I would also suggest having another conversation with your father about pushing you to meet someone you didn't want to begin with, isn't the best route to go. Sometimes allowing people to explain, can just make it more painful and bring up a lot of harsh emotions that should be better worked through with a therapist if you feel you prefer that and/or have the resources to do so.
