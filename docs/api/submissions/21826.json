I (16M) was the result of a teen pregnancy. My dad and my birthmother were 19 when I was born, so obviously, things weren't exactly easy on them. I don't know the specifics, my dad just said that \u201cit all got too much for her\u201d, and honestly, I don't care about her reasons, but basically, my birthmother left me and my dad when I was two. He met my mom two years later and I started calling her mom when I was like, six I wanna say, but really, I've called her that for as long as I can remember. She's been there for me for basically my whole life, even when I was a brat to her.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow, a few weeks ago, my birthmother started contacting my dad because she wants to have a relationship with me. I immediately pointblank refused. I don't care about her. If I was a bit younger, maybe I'd think differently, but as it is right now, I don't get why she suddenly pops in out of nowhere. I don't need or want her in my life.My dad still told me to give her a shot, cause you never know or whatever, so I gave in and met her for coffee. We sat down, got our drinks, did small talk about how I am, how I'm doing in school, etc. And honestly, it wasn't that bad at first, until she said that \u201cIt must have been difficult not to have my real mom in my life\u201d. And I told her to back up, because my real mom had been in my life since I was four. She tried to explain that she \u201cdidn't mean it like that\u201d, but I didn't care by that point, told her that my REAL mom didn't run away when things got tough, and left.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMaybe I was a bit mean, but I honestly don't feel like I was an asshole. She doesn't get to be gone for 14 years and still claim to be my \u201creal mom\u201d.

I can\u2019t force a relationship where the other party doesn\u2019t want one and likewise your BM is just going to have to deal with it no matter how hard she might find it.\n\nI would ask you to not burn all your bridges.

However, you are nit picking over her word choice, almost like you were maybe looking for a reason to reject her. \n\nYes, \"birth mom\" was probably the more technically correct term. However, lots of people say \"real mom\" to refer to the birth mom. \n\nAnd, clearly it was hard for you when she left. She was acknowledging that. You don't know the circumstances of why she left. Sometimes the absolute best thing someone can do for their child is to leave. Often, it is a gut wrenching decision, not the easy way out. Maybe there were mental health issues involved. You won't know until you give her a chance to explain herself. \n\nI am not saying you have to just pretend the last 14 years never happened. However, I think it is worth hearing her out. And cut her some slack on word choice. I seriously doubt she meant any harm by what she said. It is a common way to refer to the person who gave birth to you.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Stand firm and do not feel pressured to have a relationship with anyone you do not feel comfortable with.", "NTA. But you are pretty judgmental.  I agree she could have done better but a lesson you hopefully will learn as you mature is that not everyone is capable of handling everything with aplomb.  Like you could have chosen to be pleasant and she could have chosen to try to maintain some sort of contact with you. \n\nYou will never be able to walk in her shoes.", "NTA", "Easy for them to say, they\u2019re not in your shoes. NTA. Also, even if she didn\u2019t have it rough with a teen pregnancy, she had 10 years to at least make contact but she didn\u2019t bother. Your real mom is a lovely lady for sticking by your side", "NTA - when you're 16 everything is intense and quite confusing. You don't have any experience and limited knowledge. So making decisions can be tough. Your biggest wealth is the knowledge and experience of your family that are around you.\n\nYour dad and mom have a lot of years on you. Listen to them. Talk to your mom about it, tell her everything ,and tell her what you're thinking and feeling. Ask her advice and follow it.\n\nIf you do decide to meet your bio mom again beware your anger. You obviously and rightfully feel this woman abandoned you. This makes you sensitive to her answers and can blow your mind. do yourself a favour and write down all the questions you want answers to BEFORE you meet her. Ask your mom and dad for ideas on what questions you should ask. If you do decide to meet I'd pretend she isn't your bio mom just someone you are interviewing. Try and guess some of the answers she is going to give and think of follow up questions. For example when she said \"it must have been hard for you to grow up without a mom.\" Your answer \" i had a a very happy childhood with my mom. What makes you think I had it hard? How come you didn't come back if you believed I was having a hard life?\". Keep using what and how questions to open up answers. Also make sure you record the conversation so you can just focus on exploring what's being said. Then later write it out so you can fully absorb it.\n\nYou need to be ready for this conversation. It's very different to any conversation you'll ever have for the whole of your life. In fact you'll never have this conversation again with anyone else! You have to put emotion to one side as you ask your questions and at the same time it's really hard emotional work. \n\nThis woman is essentially a stranger but you need to know her justification. Maybe not today or tomorrow but one day you'll want answers.", "Nta\n\nShe should expect this possible outcome as the adult and abandoning mom in this situation. It is up to you if you want to give her a chance to elaborate on the conversation once you\u2019ve cooled down. I\u2019m sure she knows now not to call herself your mom, fair boundary. You can reach out and say \u2018I prefer you not call yourself my mother in anyway for now, if you\u2019d like to continue the conversation \u2026XYZ (insert how you feel comfortable doing so).\n\nYour explosive reaction, understandable. You\u2019re a 16yo kid meeting their prodigal mom\u2026there\u2019s no script.", "Sometimes it's just an issue of semantics.  I'm not going to speak for OP's specific circumstances but I'm sure there are cases where a birth mother will refer to herself as \"the real mom\" quite innocently, meaning nothing more than \"birth mother\" with no intention of taking anything away from the woman who actually raised the child as her own.", "I was in the same situation. Dad and SM raised me. That's who my parents are. When BM tried to come back 25 years later, I was ANGRY. I met her looking for answers and it took some time to figure out that there was never going to be an answer that could justify her leaving and I've accepted that. I've gone no contact and I'm ok with that. It brought me peace.", "The real Mom is the one who raises you. The birth or bio Mom is the one who gave birth to you. Sometimes they are the same sometimes not. NTA", "This is a really good comment.", "I'm adopted, zero interest in ever meeting bio-parents.  Refuse to ever do a DNA survey, just in case.", "I could have wrote this, as well! I agree with your judgement.", "That left him, at that.", "Holy shit your argument boiled down to \u201cbe thankful she didn\u2019t beat you instead.\u201d Wow.", "Biological mother served as a kind of surrogate. Did she really think that bringing up her absence wouldn't cause you to feel something, and that the lady who supported you while she didn't would take it personally? She then exhibits a lack of human understanding. A true mother will stand beside you. You've got one already.", "I mean, I think this is even worse; they had a two years to fall in love with their child, two years for the child to grow dependence and love for their caregiver, and then the caregiver abandons them. \n\n\n\nThe child might not consciously remember, but that only makes it worse, because they'll have emotional baggage to work through and they won't even truly know why", "The abandonment doesn\u2019t make her an ass.she wanted to actually have a life, a kid doesn\u2019t allow for that. Calling herself the real mom does make her the ass thoigh", "She wasn't a teen, she was 21 when she left. And she's been an adult for a long time in the last 14 years...", "She was 21 when she run away, not a teen anymore.", "When you produce a human being they are PART OF your life."]}
