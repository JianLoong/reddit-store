{"id": 20215, "submission_id": "14eo7x9", "title": "AITA for making school supervisor pay for the order her daughter refused to pay for", "selftext": "I'm an 18-year-old male in my final year of school. Over the past year, I have been creating and selling art near my home and in nearby colonies. Each week, I receive around 20-25 small to medium-sized orders, along with 2 large orders per month. The school allows business activities for commerce students to gain a better understanding of business.\n\nTwo weeks ago, I received a message from a girl in my school requesting a massive order. It was one of the largest orders I had received so far. She wanted 20 double-sided bookmarks, 30 single-sided bookmarks, and 5 custom art pieces, each unique. I charge $0.50 for single-sided bookmarks, $1 for double-sided ones, and $10 for art pieces. Due to the different designs and materials requested, the total cost came to $100 after rounding off. I requested a week's time to complete the order. While chatting, she mentioned her name and revealed that she was the supervisor's daughter.\n\nWe kept in touch for updates, and when the day arrived, I packed all the bookmarks and art pieces. It happened to be her birthday, and she had ordered them to distribute among her classmates and close friends. As a gesture, I decided to offer her a $10 discount, reducing the price to $90. However, when I mentioned the reduced amount, she seemed confused. I repeated the price and gave her a printed receipt with my signature and the price clearly stated. To my surprise, she became agitated and questioned why she had to pay.\n\nConfused by her reaction, I explained that it was a business transaction and that I couldn't give away my products for free. She pointed out that I often give my friends free items as birthday gifts since they are cheap and they appreciate them. I responded that I didn't know her well enough to give her over $100 worth of items. When she attempted to grab the package without paying, I noticed and quickly picked it up. I firmly stated that if she couldn't afford to buy things, she shouldn't expect to receive them for free. Unfortunately, I may have spoken loudly, and many students overheard the conversation.\n\nLater, my class professor called me in and questioned why I had humiliated the girl. I explained the situation, apologizing for my loud voice but also expressing my concern about incurring a $100 loss. Fortunately, the teacher supported me and suggested reporting the incident to the supervisor. Coincidentally, the supervisor turned out to be the girl's mother. I narrated the entire incident, explaining how her daughter had refused to pay for my services and hard work.\n\nAs the supervisor's mother, she was obligated to pay the exact amount without any rounding off or discount. The total came to $117, which I had messaged her earlier before rounding it off, as per her request. However, following this incident, the girl and her large group of friends spread negative rumors about me throughout the school, portraying me as rude and inconsiderate.
