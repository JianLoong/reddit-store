My parents were young when they had me. My mom had no family of her own and from the age of like 12, when she and my dad first got close, my dad's family became hers too. My parents dated all through high school and had me right after graduating. My mom died in her sleep when I was only 6 months old. She was 19.\n\nMy dad was never interested in me and he and my grandparents fought a lot from the time I was born to the time my mom died. They were disgusted with his lack of love or concern for me. They wanted him to be a better father than he was being and apparently pointed out my mom was the same age as him and had stepped up. But he wasn't interested. After mom died my grandparents were terrified that my dad would fuck me up. So they made a deal with him. They would get legal custody, they would raise me, and they would give him some money every month for him to do what he liked. I know it sounds strange but they saw it as a way to keep him from me unless he was serious about being a dad.\n\nI never actually saw him at all when I was little. A couple of years ago I saw him from a distance for the first time. He had some woman with him. They later got married. I would see them around but decided to still keep my distance. His wife knew about me before they even married. Now they're having a baby girl and my aunt was told by the wife that they wanted to name their baby Serenity, which is my name. She spoke to me about it because she wanted to warn me.\n\nThe second I heard about this I hated it. I saw so many issues because we would have the exact same name... I have no middle name and my aunt said they had no plans to use a middle name either. Our last names would be the same too. Plus it felt like the sharing a name could be used by some people to push for me to be in the child's life.\n\nI asked my grandparents if they could convince him not to do it. They spoke to him and he was saying he just wanted his wife to be happy. They told him he could forget about the money if he does, since it would be fucking me over. I think my grandparents also hated the idea that he was sending a clear message that he never loved me by just using the name for the kid he wants to raise. My dad ended up backing down.\n\nHis wife was pissed and she blamed me even though he said it was my grandparents who intervened. She said she knows I must have said I didn't like it or something and whatever I did, I was a selfish little c\\*\\*\\* because I took away her chance to name her child what she wanted. She said Serenity was a name she chose when she was little and always wanted to use it. My grandparents came home while she was ranting at me and made her leave.\n\nMy dad and his wife are no longer welcome at all. I can't get what she she said out of my head. So I feel like I need to ask...

It might sound weird, but they were probably afraid he would ask for custody just to have some leverage on them and get them to give them more money while making your childhood miserable at the same time. That way, even if they still gave him the money, at least you were protected. \n\n Second of all, i can (not really, but i can try) synpathize with a 19yo who suddenly finds himself as a single dad. I can understand him at the beggining being scared and frightened. But i don't understand the next 15 years. Especially since he would've had all the help possible to raise you, it's not like he had to hold 3 jobs. \n\n Naming his new kid after you is so fucked up. His wife wanted it so that there would be no doubt that you don't exist for him. The story with her always dreaming about that name is bs, i can assure you. They deserve each other. \n\n When - and trust me, it will happen- they will come at you with the sob story that your \"half sister\" (the man isn't your dad, he didn't deserve the title) deserves all the financial help grandparents gave you, shut the door in their face. Do not let them drag you down that rabbit hole. Blood relationships aren't all that are made to be. I have a ex-stepsister (she was my stepsisiter for 2 years only) that i consider my soul sister and a half sister on mom's side that i don't consider a relative at all. \n\n>I was a selfish little c***\n\n My advice would be for you to actually be one. So when they'll come with their kid to ask for money and babysitting, and they will, tell them to fuck off.", "It's weird for your dad + his partner to want to give their child the exact same name as his existing child - it's like he's trying to have a do-over. \n\nINFO - do you have a super common name combination, like Laura/Sarah/Claire Smith/Jones etc? I'm not siding with your dad - of all the names he could use, its odd that he picked yours twice - I'm just ruling commonness out of the equation.", "It sounds like they are on a lifelong quest to make you feel awful.

And now it sounds like the son has married exactly the woman he deserves.\n\nIgnore her ranting.

They are going to help you become a far superior person than your useless donor", "OP, you are most definitely NTA. I can\u2019t even comprehend how awful this must be for you. I\u2019m glad you have real parents (your grandparents) who treat you with love and respect.

It could end up in a nightmare mess! It shouldn't happen, but authorities aren't always the best with these things. \n\nGood for your grandparents for nipping this in the bud.", " NTA\u2026I\u2019m so sorry.

It's a shame she doesn't get to use her preferred name, but we all have disappointments in life and she'll just have to get over it.\n\nTry not to let it get to you. You've done nothing wrong.", "Bless your naive heart. He won't stick around for her either. I'll bet you anything that in 5 years they'll be divorced and he'll be married to someone else and abandon that kid too.", "\u2665\ufe0f\u2665\ufe0f", "Right? The name is so unusual that it just makes no sense.", "ME NEITHER. She may have already thought that the name was pretty or something, but the only reason she\u2019s being this implacable about *demanding* that name is because she doesn\u2019t like that her husband has a daughter he basically dipped out on and sees this as an opportunity to erase her from existence.\n\nOP\u2019s deadbeat dad and his shrew of a wife sound like two AHs who totally deserve each other, but damn, OP. I\u2019m so sorry you\u2019re stuck in this situation. Thank goodness you have a pair of GPs who know what the real deal is and are refusing to let you get thrown down the memory hole.", "NTA\n\nIf by any chance they do name the baby Serenity. \nSpeak to your grandparents and add a middle name in secret. Do not let him know about it at all. \nPersonally I think it might be that they assume your grandparents will leave you money / estate / college fund etc and if there are 2 people with exact same name it may be divided when it comes to the will. \nThat\u2019s the only logical reason for them naming the new baby with your exact name.\n\nIf they really wanted to name the baby because that is stepmom dream name then all they had to do is refuse your grandparents money.\nThey are only interested in the money.", "I don't live in america so i don't understand the legalities. But her adding a middle name, without telling anyone, might be a good idea. She can add her mom's name", "That makes it even weirder that your dad chose it - if it had been something like Laura Smith or Sarah Jones, I guess he could argue that it's a very usual name so he wasn't 'officially' naming his second kid after you but yours is not regular enough for it to be coincidence.", "Out of topic, but your name is beautiful, reminds me if Sailor moon", "Not at all. I'm not filled with anger, irrationality and an over-inflated sense of self like so many people on here. The world does not revolve around OP. She could be flattered she thinks the name is beautiful, but instead she has a tantrum.", "Wow, so much negativity. You were once an unborn fetus. OP is being an AH thinking she has the right to control what other people name their baby. If you're on her side you're probably an AH too. They all seem to stick together in their dysfunctional lives and never know what normalcy is.", "Thank you. I would love to have a bigger family. Nothing crazy but I love watching my aunts and uncles have this really good relationship and I would love that for future kids of mine.", "I would wait until the new baby's name is finalised and the ink is dry on the birth certificate", ">Besides, in my experience (all 37 years of it) people like him only really show attention in something shiny and new.

Sperm donor will hop in and out of baby\u2019s life causing havoc and drama. He and his baby momma have proven that they enjoy a toxic and volatile environment.", "Um, okay... I'm a Sailor Moon fan. The lead character's name is Serena/Serenity. If I had a daughter, I would ask my partner to consider Serena, as a middle name if nothing else. I can see OP's mum as a fan, because she'd've been seven or so when it was on afternoon TV and it was a very appealing series to young girls (Serena hates school and isn't that great at it, she loves cookies, cartoons and spending time with her friends, and she is genuinely scared of the monsters she fights. And yet she's a superhero who steps up even though she's scared. It's very empowering for little girls.) If the stepmother is around the same age as OP's birth parents, she may very well remember it fondly too.", "I would not just stop at a middle name, maybe consider changing your last name to something else, maybe your grandmother maiden name or even your mother's maiden name.", "And get them to specify who gets what with the birth date on the will", "Thank you! I love my name too.", ">She could be flattered she thinks the name is beautiful,\n\nShe should be flattered that the father who abandoned her and her stepmom want to give their new daughter her name?? \n\n>The world does not revolve around OP.\n\nHer dad's world should. It's called being a parent. \n\nWhat's irrational about thinking that the man who abandoned her giving his flashy new kid op's name is fucked up?? In what universe are op's sperm donor and stepmonster the good guys?? Why should op feel flattered?? And honestly, she can have all the tantrums she wants. The guy abandoned her. \n\nAre you the stepmother or something?? Cause i can't see how a normal person would think that op is in the wrong. \n\n>she thinks the name is beautiful\n\nOh, and btw, they don't want to give the name to the kid cause they think it's beautiful. Stepmonster does it to make it clear that op doesn't exist for them. Which is more fucked up than a 15yo having a \"tantrum\"\n\nGo seek some therapy", ">If you're on her side you're probably an AH too\n\nYou're on the side of a guy who abandoned his daughter.

But you might be right.", "My car is named Serenity after the spaceship in the TV show 'Firefly'.", "Honestly this, while it\u2019s not a common name it\u2019s something some people would absolutely know and love from their childhood. My cat is named Serenity for this very reason.", "Um dude chill with the overthinking\ud83d\udc80", "Hope OP sees this thread as I feel this is what the evil stepmom is after.", "NTA, and yes OP need not ask. OP's dad and his wife are bad people", "No, she didn't have a good relationship with them which is why she lived with my grandparents.", "That sucks. Did she have any siblings?"]}
