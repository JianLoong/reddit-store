My parents were young when they had me. My mom had no family of her own and from the age of like 12, when she and my dad first got close, my dad's family became hers too. My parents dated all through high school and had me right after graduating. My mom died in her sleep when I was only 6 months old. She was 19.\n\nMy dad was never interested in me and he and my grandparents fought a lot from the time I was born to the time my mom died. They were disgusted with his lack of love or concern for me. They wanted him to be a better father than he was being and apparently pointed out my mom was the same age as him and had stepped up. But he wasn't interested. After mom died my grandparents were terrified that my dad would fuck me up. So they made a deal with him. They would get legal custody, they would raise me, and they would give him some money every month for him to do what he liked. I know it sounds strange but they saw it as a way to keep him from me unless he was serious about being a dad.\n\nI never actually saw him at all when I was little. A couple of years ago I saw him from a distance for the first time. He had some woman with him. They later got married. I would see them around but decided to still keep my distance. His wife knew about me before they even married. Now they're having a baby girl and my aunt was told by the wife that they wanted to name their baby Serenity, which is my name. She spoke to me about it because she wanted to warn me.\n\nThe second I heard about this I hated it. I saw so many issues because we would have the exact same name... I have no middle name and my aunt said they had no plans to use a middle name either. Our last names would be the same too. Plus it felt like the sharing a name could be used by some people to push for me to be in the child's life.\n\nI asked my grandparents if they could convince him not to do it. They spoke to him and he was saying he just wanted his wife to be happy. They told him he could forget about the money if he does, since it would be fucking me over. I think my grandparents also hated the idea that he was sending a clear message that he never loved me by just using the name for the kid he wants to raise. My dad ended up backing down.\n\nHis wife was pissed and she blamed me even though he said it was my grandparents who intervened. She said she knows I must have said I didn't like it or something and whatever I did, I was a selfish little c\\*\\*\\* because I took away her chance to name her child what she wanted. She said Serenity was a name she chose when she was little and always wanted to use it. My grandparents came home while she was ranting at me and made her leave.\n\nMy dad and his wife are no longer welcome at all. I can't get what she she said out of my head. So I feel like I need to ask...

It might sound weird, but they were probably afraid he would ask for custody just to have some leverage on them and get them to give them more money while making your childhood miserable at the same time. That way, even if they still gave him the money, at least you were protected. \n\n Second of all, i can (not really, but i can try) synpathize with a 19yo who suddenly finds himself as a single dad. I can understand him at the beggining being scared and frightened. But i don't understand the next 15 years. Especially since he would've had all the help possible to raise you, it's not like he had to hold 3 jobs. \n\n Naming his new kid after you is so fucked up. His wife wanted it so that there would be no doubt that you don't exist for him. The story with her always dreaming about that name is bs, i can assure you. They deserve each other. \n\n When - and trust me, it will happen- they will come at you with the sob story that your \"half sister\" (the man isn't your dad, he didn't deserve the title) deserves all the financial help grandparents gave you, shut the door in their face. Do not let them drag you down that rabbit hole. Blood relationships aren't all that are made to be. I have a ex-stepsister (she was my stepsisiter for 2 years only) that i consider my soul sister and a half sister on mom's side that i don't consider a relative at all. \n\n>I was a selfish little c***\n\n My advice would be for you to actually be one. So when they'll come with their kid to ask for money and babysitting, and they will, tell them to fuck off.", "It's weird for your dad + his partner to want to give their child the exact same name as his existing child - it's like he's trying to have a do-over. \n\nINFO - do you have a super common name combination, like Laura/Sarah/Claire Smith/Jones etc? I'm not siding with your dad - of all the names he could use, its odd that he picked yours twice - I'm just ruling commonness out of the equation.", "It sounds like they are on a lifelong quest to make you feel awful.

They are going to help you become a far superior person than your useless donor", "OP, you are most definitely NTA. I can\u2019t even comprehend how awful this must be for you. I\u2019m glad you have real parents (your grandparents) who treat you with love and respect.

It could end up in a nightmare mess! It shouldn't happen, but authorities aren't always the best with these things. \n\nGood for your grandparents for nipping this in the bud.", " NTA\u2026I\u2019m so sorry.

Think that was a load of crap. She said that to make you feel guilty and a power play. \n\nYou're young, very mature, and smart - you have the forethought to see they'll be problems having the same name.\n\nWho does that with families? Especially with the same dad and same last name?Your dad is so messed up. Hate to tell you this,  but his wife is just as messed up too. They don't care about any child, but even their own. They are very selfish,  self-centered people. \n\nYou're way better off not having them in your life. Best avoid them and their child and future children.\n\nHaving the exact same name also means complications later in life. It can mess up your credit history, you can have debt collectors think you're her when you're not, if by strange fate you go to the same college you could get the wrong transcript especially if being directly mailed to an employer or graduate school you may never know its the wrong one,  if her drivers license suspended or warrant out for her... see where I'm going?\n\nJust because they currently plan not to use the same name, does not mean they won't.

The process is pretty simple, you can go to the social  security office for info. Best to do this before you graduate high school this way transcript will have the \"correct\" name.

Other than grandparents knowing of the name changed,  tell no one.  I suspect as soon as his wife hears the name it'll be her new favorite name. Skip the drama, tell no one you added a middle name to your name. \n\nRemember you don't talk to your dad, have nothing to do with him,  yet you found out about them wanting to name their baby same as your name.

I am sorry that he is such a poor, mostly absent father but it sure sounds like your grandparents are pretty great! Nice that your aunt was looking out for you, too as it would have been a much more difficult situation to deal with if you had not had the advance warning and therefore the time to try to change it.\n\nI was in a similar situation, my dad remarried and stayed in town and had another daughter with the same initials as mine, just 2.5 years younger than me, and it created all sorts of problems. We ended up taking home the wrong report cards a few times, another time we were placed in adjacent rooms at the pediatrician's office and had my Mom not been an awesome keen-eyed advocate for my health, I might not be here to write this because the nurse brought an injection into the room for the other child and almost gave it to me but my mom questioned her and was able to figure out the issue before I was given the wrong medication. Once we were older, I constantly received phone calls meant for her and she received calls meant for me. (Back in the days of a phone book that was delivered to every house and single women were advised to list their numbers under their initials and name of their town only instead of full name and addresses to avoid \"advertising\" the fact that they were a single female living alone.) I also was on the receiving end of some ugly collection calls and letters meant for her (not fun).  And all this was with the same initials, not the exact same name! \n\nThat should have been a \"no-brainer\" from the start, your dad should have said \"No, we cannot name our child the same name, or any version like it, as my older daughter. It would not be fair to her and could make life difficult for both girls.\" to his current wife when she first suggested the name. Honestly, it sounds more like she cares more about the name of the child that she choose when she was just a child herself than the actual child or else she would not even begin to consider placing this burden on her daughter! If the name \"Serenity\" is so important to her that she would come to your home and be so vicious mouthed to you, maybe she should consider marrying a different man so that she can have the name and the child would not be burdened with the same name or same father, and all the confusion that would be caused if she has her way.

Don\u2019t know if there\u2019s a cultural thing here but that just makes it seem so obvious that they are essentially making the new kid as the dads only daughter", "And that thought process never made sense to me. If you want to erase the other kid why would you want the same name and be a constant reminder every time it's said", "And, as somebody commented, OP's grandparents have to identify CLEARLY which grandaughter has to inherit: using her birthdate, stating she's the daughter of \\*her mum\\*, whatever. If not, her sperm donor and wife will try to steal the inheritance. They are vultures.", ">Bio dad is absolutely gonna name that kid Serenity on the birth certificate, but call them something else to everyone's face.\n\n/u/VegetableShine8843 this is so important. PLEASE insist to your grandparents that they make sure whatever you're going to get from them is as ironclad as they can make it.", "OP is being lovingly raised by her paternal grandparents who I assume share the same surname as her bio-dad.", "Maybe take the maiden name as a middle name then?", "Good point.", "Yuppp. I get stories about my baby nephew that sound like just the worst stuff to deal with (apparently he somehow pooped on the wall one time? Lol) but his parents love him and care about him so they\u2019re both willing to do it. \n\nSomeone like this? No way. I guarantee that wife is gonna be expected to cook and clean while dealing with the aftermath of giving birth.", "Also the name of a sailor moon character. So wife might be a fan.", "I refuse to believe someone that awful could be a Browncoat", "Hey listen friend. There's an important distinction about family. Sharing blood is not what's important, it's the people you choose to call family that matter. Your father was never your family, he made that clear. The people you love and who love you back are.", "If you ever want or need a cool, weird internet aunt, I'm here. I'm so sorry about your mom, but am glad your amazing family has kept her love for you alive through theirs. You are a hero and your grandparents are the best. Standing big hugs to all of you.\n\nThe donor and his wife are the only assholes. Especially her. Ffs, she has him and her kid will grow up with her bio parents. And to call you selfish for wanting to keep your name is peak asshole. But this is a woman willing to overlook that her husband is a deadbeat AND procreate with him, so there is that.", "I'm so happy that you have your grandparents (who are really your parents, let's be real) making sure you grow up happy and  healthy!", "Don\u2019t rush. There\u2019s plenty of time. Girls with absent fathers sometimes make bad decisions. Be careful out there.", "And then talk to someone about suing him for back child support.", "Not if she was fully adopted by the grandparents", "No because the grandparents would have to file and they are trying to prevent their AH son from attempting to take custody. If they had legally adopted her, this would not be an issue.", "Right! If I found out that the man I was seeing had ditched his child after her mother died and then accepted cash for not being a bigger A H, I\u2019d run and probably warn others. No decent woman would decide to marry and procreate with a guy like that, much less give the kid the same name.", "Ah okay my bad!", "Yep I misread", "No one is saying it's unusual or a bad name. Just that it's uncommon enough that it seems far too coincidental that this woman got with a dude who already had a kid with the name she had always wanted to use herself", "Yeah, I was gonna say it could be that she was a fan of Sailor Moon or the YuGiOh 4kids dub or sth.", "I feel like she could have got away with Serena. \n\nWanting to name your kid the exact same name as an existing kid who will be her sibling is bat shit crazy.\n\nEspecially when it's not 1892 and the name isn't Mary.", "Was your mom a Sailor Moon fan? NTA btw don't feel bad. Not your fault.", "Why not? She just needs to be different,not only for her mental health,but also for legal reasons. I heard several stories how things were messed up because people had same names: fines misplaced, records mixed, all this stuff. Even totally non related people can have troubles because of the same name, and here are half sisters, same father.", "If SHE even bothers...she doesnt exactly sound like a winner either!", "And no settling for less!!!", "I\u2019d like to join the cool, weird internet aunt club too \ud83e\udd23!", "Thank heaven for them\ud83c\udf08!", "Which I doubt has occurred, OP is ~~a cash cow~~ leverage", "Ugh. Wonder if OP can file suit in a couple of years...", "Feel bad for the poor baby they\u2019re bringing into the world to have such sh$tty parents.", "Ditto.", "Please tell me you have at least one plastic dinosaur on the dash?", "And she knew about his kid beforehand too, it seems way too coincidental. Even more so with having no middle names. I might be a little paranoid, but I can see this setting up a lot of legal trouble for OP down the line as well. Setting up payments in her name with no intentions of paying, or kid does something and OP gets pinned for it etc.", "Thank you :)", "Um dude chill with the underthinking...", "Or a Firefly fan.", "Seriously! This would set her up for a lifetime of identity fraud, whether intentional or accidental.", "There's no way, she's not old enough if she's 16.....OH MY GOD FIREFLY CAME OUT 21 years ago.....", "Literally says in the post bio mom had no family of her own.", "21 years\u2026 Thank you for pointing out I\u2019m old. Lol"]}
