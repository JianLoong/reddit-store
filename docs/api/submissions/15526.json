Every freaking gas station, fast food place and retail store is hiring anymore! She needs to get herself a job as a place filler until she can get back to whatever does she actually wants to do...

Even if stress-/emotional binge eating and whatnot is a real thing, she needs to realize how severe it's gotten and try to find some way to cope better than claiming you're fat shaming her for expecting to have your basic nutritional needs met and having your boundaries respected.

She won't tell me exactly why she got let go, but she claims it's because her boss is a dick (her words).\n\nSure, bosses can be dicks, but something doesn't sound right with this.

You should never have to starve like this.", "NTA\n\nI\u2019m giving you a pass on screaming because going hunry for days can impact emotional regulation.\n\nThe problem isn\u2019t her weight. The problem is you have a tight budget and her overeating means you are starving yourself.\n\nRight now your partner is making choices that hurt you.\n\nIf you have a foodbank nearby, I HIGHLY encourage you to use them. She needs to get a job. ANY job. If the stress is from being unemployed, getting a job needs to be a priority.\n\n> and she can't help it. \n\nBullshit. There are very few situations where this is the case. And if she is gaining weight it isn\u2019t hunger; it\u2019s emotional eating.

That is extremely inconsiderate.", "NTA but she\u2019s obviously struggling with depression or anxiety or something. Not saying you shouldn\u2019t feel frustrated af, but how this is currently being handled isn\u2019t making anything better. If in the US, see if she can apply for Medicaid and get some therapy, if she\u2019s open to the idea.", "NTA, Literally jobs at every turn desperate for any workers, she could have a job just not one she likes. Oh well for her. Tell her to get off her ass and go work. It\u2019s beyond ridiculous her eating so much and knowingly letting you go hungry. I don\u2019t see why your still with her but you need to do something more than telling her to stop eating everything.

She can easily go get a job at a fast food place, Walmart, do DoorDash or a number of things there is no reason to be out of work that long.

Give her a specific amount for food and tell her that there won't be any more food money till your next check--and that if she eats food you've specifically told her isn't hers you'll deduct that cost of that food from next weeks food allowance.

Who did that help? You? No. Her? No. Did that improve the situation? No. Do you feel better now that you\u2019ve aired your grievances in this manner? Probably not.

From your description she sounds like she is a bit of a low place, and while you\u2019re allowed to be upset at her for not respecting your numerous requests, have you thought to question why she isn\u2019t respecting them?  Especially if she has been respectful towards them in the past. Has she been looking for work? Has she been taking care of herself? \n\nJust something to think about. Compassion and empathy go along way in this situation.\n\nEdit: changing judgment from Y.T.A.

I'd divorce him and explain using small words why.", "This isn't about your personal situation.  What would you do if your husband actively prevented you from having nourishment?  That is at least a reasonable comparison.", "But do you eat everything in the fridge knowing that he will have to go hungry for days at a time due to you eating all the food?", "If you ate everything in the house to the point your husband was starving for days and HAD to put a lock on the fridge just to get sustenance, and then his wife assaulted and/or emotionally abused him over it, I would tell him to get a divorce. Someone that selfish is not worth staying married to.", ">I hope he\u2019s able to come at this with a little compassion\n\nwhere's the compassion when OP went *three days* without a meal because of her inability to see past herself?", "More like a lot of aggressive-aggressive. I've lived with siblings. I've had roommates. Never will I live with either again.", "So she's using you too. If she hasn't been able to find anything to do in 6 months, it's because she doesn't want to! Do you want to be with somebody who doesn't want to work? Better yet can you afford to? Because I don't think you can if you're eating lettuce and saltines because she eats everything in the house! \n\nEventually you're going to break up with her and she's going to claim it's because she gained weight (and I only say that because she jumped straight to fatphobic when you yelled at her about eating somebody's birthday gift!) You need to have a serious sit down with her and tell her she needs to get a job immediately. She needs to keep it until she gets whatever is in her career field. She needs to start paying some of the bills because you can't afford it if you can't eat meals because she's eating yours!", "She\u2019s 26 and Tim\u2019s was \u201ctoo hard\u201d? Tough shit princess. Get a job. I\u2019d reconsider the relationship. Sounds similar to my marriage. That didn\u2019t last long.", "How long of a time frame do you have for her to get a job and contribute? Or are you prepared for this to be your life?", "Oh, so she's enjoying being a freeloader as you're literally skipping meals? Is that right?\n\nBabe, is this really a person who loves you? Or even likes you? Or is she taking advantage of your decency and generosity in multiple ways?", "Then it sounds like time for her to go tbh.", "Working at *Tim Hortons* is too hard? This place has no standards. She can take 10 minutes to make a coffee and it'll be an improvement over the norm.\n\nIf your girlfriend thinks Tim Hortons is too hard (or more likely - she was fired for some reason) she is without a doubt the most pathetic person on the planet. She will never get a job, she will never treat you well, she'll just get fatter and lazier until you die of starvation.\n\nGod damn.\n\n*Tim Hortons is too hard*?", "NTA. This whole situation stinks.  The job doesn't have to be \"right\"  she just has to make it work for right now while she looks for something better.", "She's happy to mooch off of you, my dude. Someone who loves you wouldn't let you starve so they can have three servings a meal.", "Get rid of her", "Sorry but it doesnt have to be \"right for her\". It has to be legal and paying. A part time shift somewhere would bring in food money at least. The suck ass part of being a grown up is the requirement to do work for money to pay bills.", "She needs a job it doesn't have to be permanent, but it needs to be something. Personally, I'd make it a condition of the relationship working out. Obviously, she doesn't do well at home, some people thrive on a set schedule and don't do well without one.", "NTA for all the reasons others have said already. As far as the jobs not being right for her. Who cares. Her boyfriend is going hungry because he is caring for her should be her primary concern. I understand being depressed from losing a job and stress eating. But 6 months is time to move on. I gently suggest she gets some therapy which I understand is probably not feasible if she doesn\u2019t have insurance but maybe there is a way. I suggest to her to get a job maybe in retail where she can get a discount. Work to build up a new wardrobe  for interviews and when she gets back in the workforce. Get a job at grocery store. Even walking dogs or babysitting for some money to help buy food.", "That would be the end for me\u2026she doesn\u2019t want a job because she\u2019s being taken care of by you. Why work if you get to live for free\u2026and get twice as much food as your partner?  Either dump her or, if you want to be nice, require that she be evaluated for depression no that she find a job and keep it within the next two months.  If not, she\u2019s gone.  OP you are NTA.", "\"It's too hard\"??\n\nWhy would you accept this explanation while you are working, paying all the bills and apparently not even being decently fed? Why are you bankrolling this?", "It is your life and relationship, but personally I would dump someone that felt they were too good for local employment, took advantage of me financially, and ate me out of house and home. Just what does she bring to the relationship aside from companionship?", "Exactly! Even 5 years ago I was typing out speeches online for extra money. There's lots of jobs to be had if you actually want to work.\n\nThey clearly do not have enough to pay the bills and she needs something to keep her busy... There's so many work from home jobs, so many part time jobs and side hustle gigs! It's absolutely ridiculous that she's doing nothing while they don't have enough money to eat.", "There's a lot going on here with her that you should both figure out. Stealing your food, not attempting to get a job while you're paying all the bills. You should figure something out because this will only get worse I'd imagine. NTA", "What did she do before becoming unemployed long-term?", "She may be experiencing significant depression.\n\nBut she NEEDS to work - you can\u2019t afford to support both of you. It will be hard. It\u2019s going to be a struggle. Sometimes you just have to take a job that sucks. Treatment should be able to help if it\u2019s depression. \n\nBut the current situation isn\u2019t sustainable for you or the relationship. (Including her lack of care and respect for you, her partner.)", "Does she even do chores?", "Yeah that can happen tbh. That's... 'normal' I would think.\nBut as you described, that got really out of hand.\nThat sounds like there are other issues at hand that need addressing.\n\nMaybe you can talk to her, after apologizing for yelling at her.\nBut never the less that's not acceptable, considering your money situation.\n\nI'd go with NTA, only the ass for yelling, but that's also understandable because you're... hangry (sorry for the pun), and frustrated, understandably so.\n\nI wish you the best, and hopefully you can find a solution!", "I understand, it is concerning that she\u2019s gained 30 pounds in six months.  I\u2019m not trying to body or fat shame.  I\u2019m concerned this could be a result of her being depressed.\n\nI was laid off a few years back and you go through all these emotions and psychological turmoil.  I didn\u2019t turn to food, it was the opposite for a while and I\u2019m a foodie.  Sometimes you\u2019re in a funk and need to speak with someone.  That\u2019s all I\u2019m saying.", "I don't think she's being entirely honest with you. Mentioning Timmies I assume you're Canadian and it's *very* hard to fire someone with cause here, which is what would've had to happen for her not to qualify for unemployment. Are you certain she didn't quit? Especially considering she won't tell you why she was let go... It's all a bit odd", "Are you sure she's not dealing with a heavy depression? Her eating habits are clearly out of hand. \n\nNTA tought", "In which case, NTA.\n\nI\u2019m still of the opinion that she\u2019s not in a good place and this binge eating is a symptom of something more. It really sounds like she is to food what an alcoholic is to booze. This won\u2019t change without a serious intervention. \n\nShe needs help dude. I would suggest she moves out for starters.", "yeah but nothing justifies yelling at someone, at least in my opinion, but, like i said, she\u2019s also inconsiderate and disrespectful, so everyone kinda sucks for me", "It must be Pom juice. I think Walmart has it the cheapest", "[removed]", "[removed]", "She's clearly going through a depression. It's compassion and kindness but yeah your right the world just lacks it now days", "I think it's more like she's seriously depressed and developed an eating disorder. Seems like she's sick for real. This isn't about her not loving OP. She needs help.", "people like this make me sick", "I sleep eat too. It's a fucking nightmare, but at least I live alone so no one else is subjected to my insanity.", "yeah she's acting like an animal dude, she may need pro help", "I don't think I could be with someone who needed a lockbox on the fridge if they weren't like sleep eaters. like control yourself get help", "That\u2019s fair. I like the way you\u2019re looking at it.", "Totally. Her actions are not ok. But a lock as a suggestion seems a bit much.", "That doesn\u2019t even make sense.", "Maybe she was eating all of the food there too", "My 20\u2019s were full of crap jobs because I was an actress. I hated some of them and but did them because one has to survive in the world and pride would stop me mooching off of my bf for six months. Eating all the food? This girl has no shame.", "She was the assistant manager at a home building center. She won't tell me exactly why she got let go, but she claims it's because her boss is a dick (her words).", "Sometimes. We have a sort of 50/50 split that hasn't changed since she lost her job. I've suggested it changing it since she doesn't work, but she says it's unfair for me to try and take advantage of her losing her job.", "He should only apologize AFTER she sincerely apologizes. She's in the wrong here. She's the reason there's issues. She's the one who is causing problems. She's the one who is pushing him to his limits. She's eating all his food. She's unwilling to get a job. She knows exactly what she's doing. Op has been tolerating this for too long. Should he have yelled, no. But she is playing the victim when she has no right to. He didn't fat shame her. He yelled badly once out of total exhaustion and frustration. He's at his wits end. That doesn't make op a bad guy. She's manipulating and using him over the last 6 months. He can't even have any food. If anyone is a victim, it's op.", "He\u2019s literally being starved. He\u2019s yelling from hunger. I would too.", "Yelling is a good way of enforcing boundaries that have been repeatedly run over and is a good tool when other more restrained approaches have failed. Use it sparingly but when you absolutely need to assert your boundaries and rights as a person.", "it's this fancy, carbonated Italian soda with a name I can't pronounce. I like it because it tastes exactly like pomegranate but without the seeds.", "It's not about the juice. It's about the fact that I told her not to take the juice, and she didn't care enough about me to leave it alone.", "Well then she can get off her but and bit her own of $5 isn't a lot to her. Oh wait it is, because she is unemployed. \n\nOp deserves better than supporting a lazy freeloader", "I don't think op is AH I just think it was an intense response. We have no idea what going on in peoples head and how she's managing the demons in her own had i dont think this couple is right for each other either tho she obviously needs to be with someone more understanding and he's obviously looking for more of a go getter", "Probably, but he shouldn't set himself on fire to keep her warm.", "I agree she needs help, but she is not apologizing and trying to be better. She's excusing herself and trying to turn things around on him - having been severely depressed and having an ED myself, it's still selfish not to try and watch your partner go hungry month after month, while having the nerve to not even apologize.", "[deleted]", "This is what I was thinking. But if she\u2019s not trying to get treatment, still a problem", "Yeah, I agree with you about the eating disorder. This is way beyond depression eating, and into compulsive territory.", "I sleep eat too but Ozempic seems to help. Just letting you know", "A lock box.  \n\n\nA small box, usually used in roommate situations that takes up about half a refrigerator shelf.  Just enough room for OP to keep the food he buys for himself, or as a treat.  Not locking all the food away... For pity's sake I am not a barbarian.\n\nJust a Brooklynite with a bad attitude", "Breakups take time. In the meantime, he needs to eat.", "He has the option to eat - at all - or throw the whole damn girl away.  Maybe he isn't ready for the latter, and would like to eat the minimal food he can afford?  \n\nObviously most agree that this isn't a good relationship.  But sometimes you have to take half-measures to survive.", "It makes perfect sense.  His girlfriend is stealing from him, and the suggestion is to lock up the things she is stealing.  He stated he has had to eat saltiness and lettuce for a meal.  \n\nMaybe I misunderstood, and you are doing the same, and don't feel like your husband should have recourse?  Otherwise, you're clearly not applying a comparable situation in your comment.  \n\nDoes that make sense to you?", "It's exactly what's happening here.  The girlfriend is eating everything she can get her hands on, almost as soon as it's available to her, meaning the OP is going days without food at all.    \n\n\nThe lock box is so he can protect at least enough food to keep himself fed until he can decide what his next steps are, preferably not while under the fog of malnutrition.", "Lol! That reminds me of the old Far Side cartoon where the owner of a donut shop is going over the receipts while a tubby employee id sweeping the floor. The owner says he doesn\u2019t understand why he\u2019s barely squeaking by but moves tons of inventory", "I loled a bit too hard at this.", "So if she was fired with cause she is not going to eligible for unemployment. Please rethink this relationship.", "I can sympathize with her. I was unceremoniously let go from a job where I was working my butt off and doing nothing wrong\u2014let go for the simple reason that the boss didn\u2019t want me there anymore. And that launched me into 18 mos. of unemployment. \n\nIf her situation is anything like mine was, I would attribute her behavior to depression and feeling like a failure. Someone else here said the solution may be above your pay grade and I would agree with that. I understand your frustration and I don\u2019t think you\u2019re a jerk for yelling, but I might recommend to her that she speak to a doctor about her emotional state.", "Oh good God\n\nPut her out, man", "She's a leech. You're going to have to make a decision whether you wanna stay in a relationship where she doesn't even respect or care about you enough to make sure you're left with food. NTA.", "You realize that she's being unfair and taking advantage of you for having a job, right?", "This is seriously a mental health crisis point for her.  She's not dealing with any of this in a healthy manner.", "It seems the unfairness only flows from you to her, but she's a saint. She's manipulative. \n\nI've had someone very close to me have a full mental break to the point of hospital, and never did anything like this to me. She's purely just using you at this stage.\n\nI know of someone in a relationship like this where one just \"can't find the right job\" sure he's had 12 jobs, but he's never stayed more than 3 weeks in any of them. \n\nWeigh your options and really think about the situation. Because this right now sounds like a situation that is taking a lot from you, and giving barely anything.", "Yikes... if you dont work to help with the financial chores, YOU TAKE OVER the majority of the home chores.", "But she can take advantage of your gainful employment?", "HSKDJSKDJJSJE when you put it that way\u2026\u2026..", "again, like i said, not the best approach in my opinion, not a fan of screaming your boundaries, it\u2019s even more unnecessary when it\u2019s your partner you\u2019re yelling at", "He's going without meals, working full-time to provide for both of them.  She needs to get a job.  Any job.", "Agreed with that. But it depends on what he's feeling and what he's tried so far. Ignoring and/or yelling might not be as helpful as one might hope. I think I'd sit here down, raise my concerns and set an ultimatum - it's therapy or I'm gone.", "How on earth can you say OP is the AH in this situation? Regardless of the reason why, she is eating all of the food that he buys, meaning he is having to skip meals", "I assume that's an off-label use? Are you prescribed specifically for your sleep eating?", "If they're in Canada (suspected because of Tim's, even though I know it's in the US now) that is not the case.", "Nta Ask her to go back to her parents to recuperate and for rehab.  You can't help her, you are not a professional, you can only point her in the right direction to reclaim her health. \n\nAnd that direction is away from you, because nice or angry, lock box or buying more groceries, a free roof over her head is ENABLING her unhealthy behavior.\n\nShe has no incentive to take action and seek needed solutions for her health issues.", "His partner was starving him and ignoring his boundaries.
