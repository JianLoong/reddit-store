Every freaking gas station, fast food place and retail store is hiring anymore! She needs to get herself a job as a place filler until she can get back to whatever does she actually wants to do...

Even if stress-/emotional binge eating and whatnot is a real thing, she needs to realize how severe it's gotten and try to find some way to cope better than claiming you're fat shaming her for expecting to have your basic nutritional needs met and having your boundaries respected.

She won't tell me exactly why she got let go, but she claims it's because her boss is a dick (her words).\n\nSure, bosses can be dicks, but something doesn't sound right with this.

You should never have to starve like this.", "NTA\n\nI\u2019m giving you a pass on screaming because going hunry for days can impact emotional regulation.\n\nThe problem isn\u2019t her weight. The problem is you have a tight budget and her overeating means you are starving yourself.\n\nRight now your partner is making choices that hurt you.\n\nIf you have a foodbank nearby, I HIGHLY encourage you to use them. She needs to get a job. ANY job. If the stress is from being unemployed, getting a job needs to be a priority.\n\n> and she can't help it. \n\nBullshit. There are very few situations where this is the case. And if she is gaining weight it isn\u2019t hunger; it\u2019s emotional eating.

That is extremely inconsiderate.", "NTA but she\u2019s obviously struggling with depression or anxiety or something. Not saying you shouldn\u2019t feel frustrated af, but how this is currently being handled isn\u2019t making anything better. If in the US, see if she can apply for Medicaid and get some therapy, if she\u2019s open to the idea.", "NTA, Literally jobs at every turn desperate for any workers, she could have a job just not one she likes. Oh well for her. Tell her to get off her ass and go work. It\u2019s beyond ridiculous her eating so much and knowingly letting you go hungry. I don\u2019t see why your still with her but you need to do something more than telling her to stop eating everything.

She can easily go get a job at a fast food place, Walmart, do DoorDash or a number of things there is no reason to be out of work that long.

Give her a specific amount for food and tell her that there won't be any more food money till your next check--and that if she eats food you've specifically told her isn't hers you'll deduct that cost of that food from next weeks food allowance.

Who did that help? You? No. Her? No. Did that improve the situation? No. Do you feel better now that you\u2019ve aired your grievances in this manner? Probably not.

From your description she sounds like she is a bit of a low place, and while you\u2019re allowed to be upset at her for not respecting your numerous requests, have you thought to question why she isn\u2019t respecting them?  Especially if she has been respectful towards them in the past. Has she been looking for work? Has she been taking care of herself? \n\nJust something to think about. Compassion and empathy go along way in this situation.\n\nEdit: changing judgment from Y.T.A.

We've had this conversation before or tried to in a polite way, but she shuts me down and denies it.\n\nSounds like he tried polite raising of concerns and got ignored for it.", "Agreed.  But he needn't feel responsible for her reaction.  She needs to agree to help. Same as with a drug addiction.  They'll ruin your life alongside theirs if you let them.", "Hell, there\u2019s one about 15mins from my house\u2026in England \ud83d\ude02", "Oh, the real estate problem is caused by (checks notes) *immigrants* & not the absent (many foreign) landlords who snap up all the real estate", "There you are! Guys, we\u2019ve found the xenophobe!", "It\u2019s incredibly easy to get most entry level jobs in almost every part of Canada.", "Unlivable minimum wage? Is it less livable than the $0 she is currently making?", "I was surprised to see they\u2019re building one near me in the US.", "Mate what are you waiting for? She\u2019s using you as a meal ticket and nothing more. You work your ass off, pay for everything and she allows you to starve. She doesn\u2019t respect you let alone love you. Refuses to look for work and still expects you to 50/50 chores. Get rid asap.", "pa-nash      \nThat's how you pronounce it.", "I cannot believe a psych hold was suggested because a girlfriend lost her job and is so bored she must eat absolutely every fucking thing in the house. Get a fucking job.\n\nYou can't legally kidnap people and legally lock them up away from from food for 72 hours only to have them get back out hangry. \n\nThey have to be at risk of causing harm to themselves or others before they are placed on any kind of a hold. The term risk being used as an active term, not something passive like self-harm through heart disease via cholesterol.\n\nI would get rid of her immediately. It certainly wouldn't be because she gained 30 pounds, although that can't be nice. It would be because her actions say she doesn't give a fuck about you and when you speak up about it she cries \"fat shame!\" like every other cow here in the US that won't take responsibility for their 44\" waist.", "Not to mention we all need food to survive", "Sources?", "She'd probably get fired in a week's time for sneaking burgers.", "Gosh Idk... part of the sell of mukbangs is that they often eat a lot. And unless she gains some real traction she won't be seeing any real money from it. The real problem is she is unwell mentally and is coping through over-eating. Getting that sorted out comes first.", "Oh, thank you!", "Off label usage is still valid usage bud. I use an antidepressant for migraine management. There\u2019s an Alzheimer\u2019s medication that\u2019s commonly prescribed to control OCD and ADHD symptoms. There\u2019s also a hypertension medication used for ADHD, cancer pain, opioid withdrawals, quitting nicotine, and restless leg syndrome. Just because something is being used for something off label doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s pointless, unethical, or a case of drug abuse. Its still critical to a patients well being. Its medically prescribed for a reason.", "Out of curiosity (I've never seen a therapist) - Can a therapist always tell when they're being fed a line? I sometimes worry that one person in therapy may not be very articulate and won't be able to explain themselves or what they're going through. I'm also concerned about therapists coloring the relationship through their own judgments and beliefs. Honestly just not familiar with therapy and how therapists make situations objective.", "It's kinda like any other profession in that there's great ones, good ones, bad ones, and the ones where you wanna rip up their license. Sometimes, there's a good one that just doesn't fit. There can be a lot of jumping around to find the right one."]}
