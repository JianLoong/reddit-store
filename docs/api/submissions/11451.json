Their divorce was pretty quick once my sister was born. My dad met Sarah when I was 7 and they got married after a year of dating. I got along okay with Sarah. But she was never special to me the way my parents were. I'm now 17 and Sarah wanted to talk to me recently about how I choose my mom over her. She told me I never turned down time or doing something with my mom when she asked me to do something, yet I would turn her down for something with my mom. Examples were both wanted to do something after a sports game I had when I was 13. Sarah asked after my mom did. I told her I had plans with mom. Another time Sarah was going someplace with her nieces and asked if I wanted to join them. I told her I would let her know, made plans with mom in the meantime, and told her I couldn't go. She found out I chose to spend the time with my mom. I went to my boyfriends prom with him last year and asked my mom to go dress shopping with me and my friends. Sarah was upset about it.\n\nShe told me all this not too long ago and told me it bothers her. She said she wants me to feel like I will choose her over my mom some of the time, in some things. Then she told me that my sister said she didn't pick her over mom either because she saw I never did and thought she should copy me. She told me I might have been older than my sister when she and our dad met, but we had been kids and we could have and should have been just as much her kids as our parents kids and it upset her to not be treated the same, appreciated the same and valued the same.\n\nI told her I had not set out to hurt her feelings and I was sorry that it had, but I would never regret the time I spend with my mom, any more than I regret time spent with my dad (and it only bothers her if I choose to spend time with mom over her). She asked me to choose her sometime though and not my mom. Then I told her I will never choose her over my mom and I needed her to accept that.\n\nShe's mad at me. Dad was confused when he heard and told me not to worry about it. But he then argued with my mom over it (not a huge surprise) and Sarah told me I was cruel and a bully.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1677941369, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11i0xmr/aita_for_telling_my_stepmom_i_will_never_choose/", "score": 696, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I would guess not. \n\nIt really seems she is actually trying to one-up your mom in some competition in her head. \n\nYou were respectful and honest. She's being pushy, petty and insecure.

She is manipulative, and the audacity of her to call you cruel and a bully when she is literally being the bully is insane. No logical person would think you should choose your stepmom over your mom. You have a good relationship with your mom and Sarah is mad about it. She went so far as to get your dad to berate your mom for\u2026 spending time with her children? Honestly, I feel really bad for your mom in this situation. Evil stepmom is trying to push her out and manipulate her kids. Sarah is a possessive, controlling AH.", "NTA\n\nYou have the right to love both your mom and your dad, and it is natural you see them as parents.  Just because your parents divorced and dad moved on with a new wife doesnt change that.  You can decide what kind of relationship you want to have with Sarah.  It sounds generally friendly, maybe like an aunty or older sister.  But Sarah isn't entitled to replace your mom in her mom role.  If she thinks this, dad needs to talk to her and get her to back off.", "NTA. Sarah is the emotional manipulative bully. Your mom is your parent. Just like your dad is your parent.

It is also out of line for her ever to have asked you to choose her over your mother.", "Sarah said you are cruel and a bully?!\n\n*Excuse me!*\n\nYour stepmother needs to grow up, but your dad sounds just as bad.

Sarah is so out of line.", "NTA \n\nI say this as a step mom. Children are not there to make adults feel fucking special. You didn't do anything wrong, your step moms jealousy is her own damned baggage.", "NTA why is she trying to replace your mom? She can have a good relationship with you without interfering with your relationship with your mom but she doesn\u2019t want that. She wants to be the priority- but why? She\u2019s not entitled to one just because she wants it. You\u2019re allowed your own feelings on it. She\u2019s trying to victimize herself in it now as well. And clearly your dad is on her side.", "NTA \n\nOh my. This is so brutal and selfish of her. You have every right to chose your mom over your step mom. And she should always enforce that bond between the two of you - that's what a good step mom does. \n\nEven if she does feel some type of way when you don't join an activity - and of course she can be upset about it - she should never expect you to favor her over your own mom. \n\nGlad your dad had your back on this one! \n\nAnd no, you are NOT a bully. Her saying that makes her a bully. Don't take any of this personal and enjoy spending time with your mom!", "NTA\n\nInfo - does your stepmother have biological kids?

It would be one thing if she said \u201cI really care about you and I wish we could work on having an even closer relationship,\u201d but to make it a comparison or a competition with your mom is messed up.

She can want to be seen as an equal parent, but you don't have to accommodate that feeling.", "NTA. \n\nStepmother should ways come last and she knows that. \n\nYour mother should ways come first, no matter what. \n\nIt's fine to have a bond with a step parent but its ok to always put bio parents first. \n\nStepmother knows this, she obviously can't have kids and aw an opportunity to become new mommy to you both and was disappointed when her dream didn't work out. \n\nShe's hoping that if she guilt and manipulates you enough now then you'll start choosing her over mom and you two can be closer than you are with your mother. Which in turn will have you and your sister wanting to spend all your time with her and notnyour mom. \n\nShe's been hoping that she couod cut your mother out of the picture. \n\nYou should tell her that if she wants to spend time with you that's fine, but its not a competition with your mom.

Her behaviour is disgraceful.", "NTA. Evil step mother right there. She's straight up trying to replace your mom.", "Sarah sounds like a piece of work and manipulative to boot. In what universe is it expected that a child will choose the step-parent over their own parent with whom they have a loving and close relationship. And to tell your dad that you\u2019re a bully?!! Sounds like she\u2019s splitting and trying to cause a rift between you. Does Sarah have kids of her own? Be careful of her. Obviously she needs to adjust her expectations to something more realistic. Sounds like you\u2019ve been cordial with her to this point but she won\u2019t be satisfied unless you and your sister are falling all over yourselves to spend time with her which probably ain\u2019t gonna happen. Kudos to you for being honest and clear with her. Definitely NTA.", "NTA.

Why would you choose her over your mother?", "NTA\nShe cannot force you to view her as more important than your mother.", "NTA - you are not in the wrong and it is unfair of Sarah to put you in that position. It sounds like you were fortunate enough to have both your mom and dad (and Sarah) in your life from such a young age, even through the divorce. Whereas that may not be the case for everyone coming from a broken home. When my parents divorced, they literally moved to opposite ends of the country. As a result, I lost out on a relationship with my mother. As such, I became very close to my step mom because she was the only mom that was there for me day-in and day-out. However, Sarah can't expect that from you, your mom was and continues to be a major part of your life. There is no replacing your mom. \n\nNow, I wonder if what Sarah was really trying to say is that she wants a stronger relationship with you. You've made it clear you will choose your mom over spending time with Sarah, but perhaps you can still put in an effort to spend time with both?", "NTA AT ALL.\n\nYour SM has issues that she needs to deal with. She told you that she WANTS you to choose HER sometimes? Who says that kind of thing out loud? \n\nI doubt you\u2019re choosing to spend time with your Mom to spite your SM.
