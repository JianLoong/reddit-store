Their divorce was pretty quick once my sister was born. My dad met Sarah when I was 7 and they got married after a year of dating. I got along okay with Sarah. But she was never special to me the way my parents were. I'm now 17 and Sarah wanted to talk to me recently about how I choose my mom over her. She told me I never turned down time or doing something with my mom when she asked me to do something, yet I would turn her down for something with my mom. Examples were both wanted to do something after a sports game I had when I was 13. Sarah asked after my mom did. I told her I had plans with mom. Another time Sarah was going someplace with her nieces and asked if I wanted to join them. I told her I would let her know, made plans with mom in the meantime, and told her I couldn't go. She found out I chose to spend the time with my mom. I went to my boyfriends prom with him last year and asked my mom to go dress shopping with me and my friends. Sarah was upset about it.\n\nShe told me all this not too long ago and told me it bothers her. She said she wants me to feel like I will choose her over my mom some of the time, in some things. Then she told me that my sister said she didn't pick her over mom either because she saw I never did and thought she should copy me. She told me I might have been older than my sister when she and our dad met, but we had been kids and we could have and should have been just as much her kids as our parents kids and it upset her to not be treated the same, appreciated the same and valued the same.\n\nI told her I had not set out to hurt her feelings and I was sorry that it had, but I would never regret the time I spend with my mom, any more than I regret time spent with my dad (and it only bothers her if I choose to spend time with mom over her). She asked me to choose her sometime though and not my mom. Then I told her I will never choose her over my mom and I needed her to accept that.\n\nShe's mad at me. Dad was confused when he heard and told me not to worry about it. But he then argued with my mom over it (not a huge surprise) and Sarah told me I was cruel and a bully.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1677941369, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11i0xmr/aita_for_telling_my_stepmom_i_will_never_choose/", "score": 3514, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She is manipulative, and the audacity of her to call you cruel and a bully when she is literally being the bully is insane. No logical person would think you should choose your stepmom over your mom. You have a good relationship with your mom and Sarah is mad about it. She went so far as to get your dad to berate your mom for\u2026 spending time with her children? Honestly, I feel really bad for your mom in this situation. Evil stepmom is trying to push her out and manipulate her kids. Sarah is a possessive, controlling AH.", "NTA\n\nYou have the right to love both your mom and your dad, and it is natural you see them as parents.

You didn't do anything wrong, your step moms jealousy is her own damned baggage.", "NTA why is she trying to replace your mom? She can have a good relationship with you without interfering with your relationship with your mom but she doesn\u2019t want that. She wants to be the priority- but why? She\u2019s not entitled to one just because she wants it. You\u2019re allowed your own feelings on it. She\u2019s trying to victimize herself in it now as well. And clearly your dad is on her side.", "NTA \n\nOh my. This is so brutal and selfish of her. You have every right to chose your mom over your step mom. And she should always enforce that bond between the two of you - that's what a good step mom does. \n\nEven if she does feel some type of way when you don't join an activity - and of course she can be upset about it - she should never expect you to favor her over your own mom. \n\nGlad your dad had your back on this one! \n\nAnd no, you are NOT a bully.

It would be one thing if she said \u201cI really care about you and I wish we could work on having an even closer relationship,\u201d but to make it a comparison or a competition with your mom is messed up.

Her behaviour is disgraceful.", "NTA. Evil step mother right there. She's straight up trying to replace your mom.", "Sarah sounds like a piece of work and manipulative to boot. In what universe is it expected that a child will choose the step-parent over their own parent with whom they have a loving and close relationship. And to tell your dad that you\u2019re a bully?!! Sounds like she\u2019s splitting and trying to cause a rift between you. Does Sarah have kids of her own? Be careful of her. Obviously she needs to adjust her expectations to something more realistic. Sounds like you\u2019ve been cordial with her to this point but she won\u2019t be satisfied unless you and your sister are falling all over yourselves to spend time with her which probably ain\u2019t gonna happen. Kudos to you for being honest and clear with her. Definitely NTA.", "NTA.

It sounds like you were fortunate enough to have both your mom and dad (and Sarah) in your life from such a young age, even through the divorce. Whereas that may not be the case for everyone coming from a broken home. When my parents divorced, they literally moved to opposite ends of the country. As a result, I lost out on a relationship with my mother. As such, I became very close to my step mom because she was the only mom that was there for me day-in and day-out. However, Sarah can't expect that from you, your mom was and continues to be a major part of your life. There is no replacing your mom. \n\nNow, I wonder if what Sarah was really trying to say is that she wants a stronger relationship with you. You've made it clear you will choose your mom over spending time with Sarah, but perhaps you can still put in an effort to spend time with both?", "NTA AT ALL.\n\nYour SM has issues that she needs to deal with. She told you that she WANTS you to choose HER sometimes? Who says that kind of thing out loud? \n\nI doubt you\u2019re choosing to spend time with your Mom to spite your SM.

The inconsiderate part of OP would be \"keeping stepmom's hopes up\" that OP would spend some time with her and the nieces and than having those hopes \"come crushing down\" because OP went to actively find a reason *not* to spend time with them. From stepmom's perspective I get that must have hurt.\n\nBut considering stepmom gave an other example from 4 years ago, it wouldn't surprise me that that story was *also* from a few years ago, when OP was a young teenager. Kids that age tend to not always think about stuff like that, and don't like to be pushed into doing something either. Which is probably the reason OP went the way they did. OP probably didn't think they could have just said \"no\" because stepmom wouldn't have accepted it. Was it nice from OP to do that? No. But OP being that young and being pushed into doing something people shouldn't be pushed into probably didn't think they had another way of getting out. Dad and stepmom should have just let things go naturally. That way OP might have had a better bond with stepmom now.\n\nEdit: wording", "[removed]", "You're right.

I said they have a father, so be a friend. Sarah is overstepping and your father needs to realise his relationship with you is more important than keeping his dick wet. Sorry to be crude, however he\u2019s trying to appease his wife by putting your mum on fire. That\u2019s not ok. He needs to put Sarah back in her lane.", "NTA. You have only one mother. She shouldnt even approach you about this, its extremely narcissist of her. Something tells me, you choosing her over your mom is her ultimate goal, not your well being. Because you are well the way you are now.\n\n\"Then I told her I will never choose her over my mom and I needed her to accept that.\"\n\nThis was very mature of you, and also clear, simple words are always the best to explain anything. It's not your fault that she cant accept something that is natural and normal. The problem lies with her.\n\nJust keep being yourself, keep being a good son to your mom, as long as you live according to your moral compass and your heart you will be golden. Good luck.", "NAH  it\u2019s lovely that she loves you enough to be hurt, but you did phrase it in a sensitive way.\n\nTell her that you love her, and that she comes before all of your friends, but that your biological mom and dad will always be numbers 1&2.  Try to think of compliments for her, such as \u201cyou\u2019re an incredible step mom, when I hear stories from <friend name> about their step mom, I\u2019m so grateful for you\u201d.\n\nAnother alternative is to not address this again, but make efforts to show her that (despite being #3), you still care about her.  Maybe ask her out for 1:1 time or ask her advice on something (even if you don\u2019t need advice).\n\nThere\u2019s room in your heart for lots of love.  It\u2019s not a competition.", "Sounds like your step mom is the AH", "Oh HELL no, she's way out of line NTA", "NTA \n\nIt's insane your stepmom would even think you should choose her over your mom let alone ask it of you. She's an AH, and so is your IF he asked your mom to encourage you to do so. I hope he didn't but...", "A therapist would ask \"What do you think your step mom needs from you?/ What did you hear when she asked you this?\" If a grown woman actually said to her step daughter \"I expect you to choose me over your mom sometimes.\" then yeah, she sucks. I have a feeling that's not how the conversation went. \n\nI bet what Sarah actually did was openly communicate that she wanted to be closer, that she thinks of OP as her own daughter, that she enjoys her company and wants her to know she loves her and values her time with her, and wants to spend more time with her. And I bet OP was cold, closed off, and defensive. \n\nStep mothering is a thankless job. You think teen girls gaf about how much of the time and love they devote to another woman's kid? They get zero joys of babyhood and all the dirty looks and bad vibes of adolescence. This woman wants to be closer to her step daughters, and she's being punished for it. The language of \"choose her over her\" makes it sound like a competition, when in all actuality she's asking for her step daughter to open her heart and accept her. That's what she was asking. But a teen has too much ego to see what the real need in that conversation was.", "Ditto. I love them but their mum will always be their mum.", "Well yea, she's 17 now and was even younger when this particular situation happened. Of course she has growing up to do, she was a literal child during these situations.", "Sure, but why does that make it acceptable behavior? It's okay to say 'you were at least partially in the wrong but it's not necessary your fault because you are young'\n\nThe whole 'I hate my step parent because they aren't my real parent' is generally a young person thing, up until they realize a good reason to not be like them or realize that there was not good reason to begin with. Believe me, I understand that this is an unpopular opinion but I see it as close to truth."]}
