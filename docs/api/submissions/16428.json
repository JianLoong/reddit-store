I send $50 to each child for their birthday, $100 for Christmas, and$100 for graduation.  \nWhen my oldest graduated, the 48M cousin and 44F cousin sent him $100, the 48F and 40F didn't even call, which was no big deal. My 21yr old niece graduated the same year so I turned around and sent $100 back to her. \nThis year, since I have one graduating and my two nephews.  I sent the two nephews $100 each.  \n48F called me and asked where the rest of the money was.  Not really understanding what she was talking about, I asked \"what money?\". She started screaming and yelling, saying that I owed her son $200 more than what I sent because I have 3 kids which in turn means my kids are going to get a total of $300 from them, yet I'm only spending $100 on her son. \nI calmly explained that $100 was our customary graduation budget and that I just didn't have it. Besides, it would be unfair for me to send her son $300 but the other nieces and nephews only get $100. She pressed on and on that I owe her son $300 or I needed to give her the money back that my son received for graduation. When I brought up the fact that she didn't even call my son on graduation, much less give him anything monetary, she said that she was a single mom and I shouldn't expect her, nor should she have to contribute to my son. (I never expected anything from her, I was just being nice and sending an invitation).\nShe got mad and called me selfish, greedy, money hungry, etc.  I told her that we would just have to agree to disagree and ended the conversation. She called all of the cousins and they \"agreed\" that I should give each child, not just the only child graduates, $300! \nI told them all that they were absurd. I have now been banned from all family functions.  They even banned my mom also. My daughter went to the 18Ms birthday party and my 48F cousin snatched the birthday card from her hands, opened it, took the $100 birthday money ($50 from me and $50 of her own) , and threw the card back at her and told her that unless I send what is rightfully owed to him, she can't be a part of the family! \nMy mom has said that I should just apologize, give each kid the $300 and make amends. I live paycheck to paycheck as it is so I start scrounging early.

But as someone living paycheck to paycheck, I genuinely think you are being an AH to yourself to give a $100 gift while you are struggling. In my whole life I haven't received that much from one person. It's okay to send a nice card with a heartfelt handwritten message, and then call it a day. $100 is very nice of you, and incredibly generous for someone in your precarious financial position, but that's a lot of grocery money and as a parent it's fair to prioritize building up a reliable emergency fund before giving more gifts so big.", "NTA\n\nGo no contact with them all.
