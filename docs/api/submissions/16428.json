Besides, it would be unfair for me to send her son $300 but the other nieces and nephews only get $100. She pressed on and on that I owe her son $300 or I needed to give her the money back that my son received for graduation. When I brought up the fact that she didn't even call my son on graduation, much less give him anything monetary, she said that she was a single mom and I shouldn't expect her, nor should she have to contribute to my son.

My daughter went to the 18Ms birthday party and my 48F cousin snatched the birthday card from her hands, opened it, took the $100 birthday money ($50 from me and $50 of her own) , and threw the card back at her and told her that unless I send what is rightfully owed to him, she can't be a part of the family! \nMy mom has said that I should just apologize, give each kid the $300 and make amends.

If you give someone money it\u2019s theirs, you gave it to them because it\u2019s a gift and you wanted to make that someone happy or something. It is a gift not a loan.", "[removed]", "NTA. Holy cow get away from these toxic people!  Gifts are exactly that - gifts. Some families, including my own sometimes, will talk smack about people who get nice gifts for their occasions but then bring cheap gifts or don\u2019t show up to things so they don\u2019t have to bring a gift. But I\u2019ve never had a family member insist on an equal return.  The way they treated your daughter especially is abusive.  I get where your mom is coming from - just trying to get along. But she\u2019s wrong OP, do not give into this extortion", "I don't get your cousin. Like I don't even understand her math. Is there a chart? Because I don't understand how she comes to 300 per child...\nYou got 200 in total for 1 child.\n\nScenario 1:\n\nEvery cousin and you sends the other 100 per child. She owes your child 100. And the other cousins need to send her 100 each...\n\nScenario 2:\nIt all needs to even out per family. The cousin with the most children has 4. I assume you have 3 for most math inconvenience possible. That would mean, that every child should get an amount, that is devidable by 4 and 3 - Like 120.\nWe then multiply that amount by 4. 480.\nShe has 2 kids. That's 240 per child. So you'd owe her children 140 each.\nYou have 3 kids. That's 160 per child. So she'd owe your child 160.\n\nScenario 2 is BS by the way. Scenario 1 is the logical way. Neither scenario explains the 300.\n\nUnless we are talking the ridiculous Scenario 3:\nYou pay for every cousin.\n\nOr my favorite Scenario 4, that snowballs out of control very fast:\nEveryone has to pay the amount all previous children got to the next child.\n\nIn Scenario 4, I'd get pregnant again out of spite.\n\n\nCall a family emergency meeting at your mother's place. Tell them, that because they decided to exclude you from the family and demand payment as well as mistreat and exclude your daughter, you are canceling the subscription. Since your mother has decided to take their side taking care of her and her expenses is now their responsibility and the true purpose of this meeting is for them to figure out among themselves how to go forward. You are no longer part of this family and will pay no longer any money. If they want any contact, contact this lawyer.\n\nDrop mic, walk out. Drive away. (Have hubby or child in car, ready for take off) Live without toxicity and watch them scramble, when they realize you were actually serious. Then don't give in unless you and your daughter get a massive, sincere apology from all involved.", "Literally throw her in the trash.", "Wait what? She didn\u2019t give anything at all and expects you to give more to her son than anyone else? \n\nHave you talked to the other cousins? This seems fishy", "When people show their true colours, believe it. \nGet away from these people, they\u2019re driven by greed not love. NTA", "First things first, absolutely NTA. I understand you mom's suggestion is just to keep the piece but then they'll just feel more entitled because you caved.\n\nBut wait, so by your cousin's logic, her child should get $300 from, while your children \"only\"(can't italicize on mobile) get $100 each?\n\nTell her to go fuck herself with that one. Or, send the $200 and then don't send anything for the next couple of occasions(until you make the $200 back) and say you just can't afford it rn", "NTA and why are people so freaking insane?? You're better off without these people, sorry to say.", "Dang OP gives $1200 a year plus an extra $100 whenever someone graduates, and the parents want more?!?! Not even the people actually being gifted the money, no their parents feel it\u2019s somehow not fair\u2026wtf?! Obviously NTA, I\u2019m so sorry your family is being this way, craziness", "Save your money, cut off the leeches.", "NTA. One of the reasons we don\u2019t use money at all when it comes to giving gifts.", "If OP is struggling to send each one $100, at least this way, OP can stop sending the cousins money and save instead.", "You need to tell your mother that, since you aren\u2019t a blood relative, she needs to go to her siblings to manage her finances and support her.

The gall of your cousins and mom!", "I need to know how the fuck they spent $750k in 6 months\u2026 did they buy a house?? gamble it all away? buy a bunch of cocaine to deal and forget to deal it?
