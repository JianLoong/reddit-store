My 21yr old niece graduated the same year so I turned around and sent $100 back to her. \nThis year, since I have one graduating and my two nephews.  I sent the two nephews $100 each.  \n48F called me and asked where the rest of the money was.  Not really understanding what she was talking about, I asked \"what money?\". She started screaming and yelling, saying that I owed her son $200 more than what I sent because I have 3 kids which in turn means my kids are going to get a total of $300 from them, yet I'm only spending $100 on her son. \nI calmly explained that $100 was our customary graduation budget and that I just didn't have it. Besides, it would be unfair for me to send her son $300 but the other nieces and nephews only get $100. She pressed on and on that I owe her son $300 or I needed to give her the money back that my son received for graduation. When I brought up the fact that she didn't even call my son on graduation, much less give him anything monetary, she said that she was a single mom and I shouldn't expect her, nor should she have to contribute to my son.

She called all of the cousins and they \"agreed\" that I should give each child, not just the only child graduates, $300! \nI told them all that they were absurd. I have now been banned from all family functions.  They even banned my mom also. My daughter went to the 18Ms birthday party and my 48F cousin snatched the birthday card from her hands, opened it, took the $100 birthday money ($50 from me and $50 of her own) , and threw the card back at her and told her that unless I send what is rightfully owed to him, she can't be a part of the family! \nMy mom has said that I should just apologize, give each kid the $300 and make amends.

For the sake of your own mental health and your children, please do not indulge that family anymore. You are not a bank or a charity. If they really need help, there are programs for that. Financial hardships are 100% relationship enders because it shows you their true colors. Please open your eyes to their abuse and get away. I truly wish you and your actual family well. Congratulations to your graduates and best of luck! \ud83e\udef6", "NTA, but if I were u I would cut everybody out including ur mom. She obviously doesn't care about u or urs, just that u can financially support her just like her bio family.  I'm so sorry OP, sending u and urs positive and healing vibes \ud83d\udc99", "I\u2019d stop paying her bills immediately. That is not your responsibility.", "Welp, that's the saddest fucking thing I've seen today.\n\nScrew them. You're worth more than the money they can manage to squeeze out of you.\n\nNTA.", "Tell mom that you\u2019re saving to give all of your cousins\u2019 kids $300/each like she requested and won\u2019t be able to pay any of her bills going forward because of it. Because from what you\u2019ve said, you literally can\u2019t afford to do both. So make her deal with the consequences of these demands or agree to drop it.", ">\tThe family \u201ctook me in\u201d (adopted) so now I owe them.\n\nThat\u2019s disgusting. If that\u2019s how they truly feel, fuck all of them, cut them all off. They don\u2019t deserve you in their lives. **NTA.**", "Ikr, theres some crazy dynamic at the mothers part of the family tree thats making these cousins so entitled.", "Good Lord.  Estrangement sucks but their behaviour is the worst.  Yikes.", "I wonder if the kid gets to keep the money being sent?  Considering the reaction the parents might grab it & squirrel it away as soon as they get in the car to go home.", "That's why I asked about the cousin's parent or parents, the OP's mother's sibling(s) ..... Something must be up thee for this to go so crazy.\n\nIn a comment, the OP said they were adopted, and the mother said that her siblings were the only blood relatives she has, so there's some pretty crappy behaviour all round...", "Totally agree with you.  It\u2019s time to cut the gravy train.  Let your \u201cMom\u201d ask her blood relatives to support her.  After all I think he\u2019s already repaid the favor of her taking him in.", "oh how i love a petty mind. you're my new best friend."]}
