{"id": 17412, "submission_id": "13jcpbo", "title": "WIBTA If I Set an \"I Don't Babysit\" Boundary?", "selftext": "I (F 20s) have severe anxiety to the point it's affecting my physical health. I'm seeing a therapist and trying to get it under control.\n\nOne of my anxiety triggers is babies and toddlers; I can't be around them for long. My anxiety also gets triggered badly by loud noises, so maybe that's part of the reason why. I don't hate kids or babies, but I always feel anxious around them and need to leave a room if they're too loud and rambunctious. I don't blame them because they're just little, but I'm trying to take responsibility for my own anxieties and this is the only way I know how. \n\nI have a 3.5 yo niece. She's adorable, but lately she's been throwing things at people for fun, I think in an attempt to play catch. This might not sound like too big of an issue, but she's big for her age and can really throw things hard. The last time I babysat her, she threw a heavy toy at my head, and I couldn't stop her in time; my nose bled a lot, but nothing was broken. She also screams after she throws things, which adds to my stress. I usually have to stay in my room trying not to have a panic attack after these babysitting sessions. Her parents don't stop her from throwing things, and her dad encourages it at times. She's broken things around their house and they'll shrug it off as a kid being a kid.\n\nHere's where I might be the AH: my niece's mom's health isn't great and she could for sure use a break. She asks me to babysit sometimes, even though I work. I work from home, so I think people have it in their heads that I can just drop what I'm doing whenever. I don't always say yes, but when I have a slow day, or niece'smom needs to goto the doctor for her treatment, I can't think of a good enough excuse not to and I'll do it. I feel as though I'm obligated because they're family, but it's really been affecting my health (mentally and physically). I don't want to do it anymore, not just for them, but for anybody. \n\nI talked to my husband and asked him what he thought if I set an \"I Don't Babysit\" boundary for myself. He forwarned me that our niece's parents wouldn't be happy, but that he had my back. I feel bad knowing that her mom isn't well, but also I feel as though I'm putting myself at risk by helping out in this way. \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1684260768, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13jcpbo/wibta_if_i_set_an_i_dont_babysit_boundary/", "score": 77, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

What is my problem is my physical and mental health. I don't have kids for a reason.\n\nRemember to take care of yourself and respect yourself.

I don\u2019t know what your finances or ability to to help us like but you/husband can do something else to assist.

And you don't have to have an excuse.  Just say no.\n\nIf your niece's mom has to go to the hospital, that is a situation where the nice thing to do (you're still not obligated, but it would be nice) is babysit.  But just for a break....nope.", "Absolutely NTA. It seems like you have been very accommodating in the past with babysitting, but your health and a your job are a priority, and you need to share with your nieces mom and any others that you've realized you're struggling and can no longer help out, and not only does struggling with your known anxieties not only put YOU at risk but impairs your ability to care for children as well. As a parent myself, I would respect any person that shared that with me. I have 2 sisters and 1 of which just isn't a kid person. She's impatient and would prefer to spend her free time on herself.  She's chose to never have kids, and good for her.  I have never asked her to babysit because I know she would rather not. She has said she would if there was an absolute emergency but even then she should be my last to call. I have never had to call her and my son is 7 now. Your friends and family need to respect that boundary of yours as well.", "NTA\n\nFirst, if you're working, you can't also be babysitting a three year old. Three year olds need your full attention. Your job also needs your full attention. The two are not compatible.\n\nSecond, if you have time off work, the sure, it's a nice thing to do to help out your sister by watching her kid. And you'll build a deeper relationship with your niece if you're the aunt that's part of her life, rather than the aunt she sees once or twice for holidays. But if you can't be around kids for your own health, then you can't do this. And sure, it means you won't develop as close a relationship with your niece, but if you can't do it, you can't do it.\n\nTelling them your health is no longer good enough to allow you to babysit is perfectly reasonable.", "NTA--and if the parents have seen you interacting with this kid, they should not be asking. A babysitter who panics and retreats when kids get rambunctious *cannot do their job*. \n\nA babysitter is there to keep kids entertained, yes, and to stop kids from breaking things, yes, but a babysitter is also there to keep kids from *accidentally harming themselves*. If you can't step in when things are going wrong, the outcome could be a lot worse than a broken vase. \n\nYou're not just refusing on your own account, but on the kid's. Until you're up to the job, you'd be endangering the child by accepting.", "NTA. But if you pay for a baby sitter, then it might smoothe issues. You have valid health and work reasons for refusing. But your MiL is struggling. Not your child, not your problem, but if finances allow a day at kindegarden might be a life saver for them and help socialise your niece.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
