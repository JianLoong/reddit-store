Every once in a while, just to get off quick and relieve stress, is one thing, but if you\u2019re jacking it to strangers three times as often as you have sex with the person you\u2019re supposed to actually be involved with, that\u2019s weird.

Men masturbate for lots of different reasons, not just as a substitute for sex with their partner. In fact, masturbation is actually sex, not a substitute for it. Everything that happens in the body when someone has sex with their partner also happens with masturbation.

Though if you never ask I\u2019d say you\u2019re 100% the asshole because he may not want to ask you for sex everyday because you may take it in a bad way and think he\u2019s only with you for sex.", "NTA - porn addictions are very commun and can be very damaging, I'm not saying he has one for sure, but 5 times a week consistently isn't good.

Communicating about sex is hard and masturbating is not adultery... as long as certain boundaries are not crossed. Having sex is way more complicated and requires communication, consent, foreplay, etc. So it can be a bit much to initiate sex every time, while masturbating is a quick and simple way to relieve stress. Also it prevents prostate cancer. \nIf you want to remove those barriers for him to have sex with you at any time either initiate or look in to CNC (consensual non consent), but do so at your own risk because it could damage your libido in the long run (because your needs aren't met) but that's up to you. Making a porn together could also be a possibility, but be aware of the risk of that leaking at a certain point.\n\nHowever... and this is my very personal, non research backed opinion, watching porn might not be sustainable depending on the type, amount and necessity of it. If he needs porn to masturbate and needs lots of it, this might be damaging to your relationship and the ability to have and enjoy sex. Especially if the porn he watches is increasingly different from the type of body you have and the kind of sex you are having, because he might be setting himself up for standards you cannot meet, leading to decreased interest in you. I myself, as a man, have always severely limited my porn intake and relied on my imagination for most of the time. I find this to be less alienating but like I said, that's personal and it's all about quantity and quality. If he watches \"girl next door\" porn for 10 minutes at a time that wouldn't bother me. If he has hour-long sessions to potentially illegal stuff - I would be very worried.", "The porn's not going to watch itself.", "YTA if you haven't actually expressed to him that you want to have more sex.

Not really any explanation needed. If your boyfriends wants to jerk off and doesn\u2019t want to have sex every night that\u2019s perfectly understandable and 1-2 times a week is still more then a lot of couples might have.", "We see each other almost every day, we only spend the night on weekends. There's definitely time, it's just not always convenient for him. But if it's convenient enough to wack it, why isn't it convenient for sex?", "I\u2019m a female and masturbate a lot of days, it\u2019s so normal and as you said so is porn.

So it could definitely be that it\u2019s convenient to wack it but not convenient for sex.", "Wacking it is a lot faster and sometimes that all we want. Just to release it. Sex requires foreplay and intimacy which maybe he only has enough to give twice a week", "I think YTA based on this. It seems like he wants to spend his time with you doing other things aside from sex. Masturbating alone can be simple, quick, and dirty for some people. With the goal just to have a nice orgasm and go on their way.\n\nBut then between the both of you: there are 100 ways a couple can be close, feel love for each other, and have intimate moments that aren\u2019t sex. He may prefer to watch a movie with you and talk about the plot, he may like your laugh when you\u2019re cooking together, he may like the way your brow furrows when you\u2019re focusing on the crossword.\n\nHim masturbating daily instead of having sex with you daily is NOT an insult. Try not to take it as such", "As others have said sex and masturbation are not the same thing. Also I'd add that although the professional porn industry has some scummy practices, that doesn't make porn in itself an evil thing. There's absolutely porn out there that doesn't exploit the models.\n\nThe bigger potential issue is with your sexual compatibility. I'd suggest a frank conversation about whether your libidos are compatible, it's more than likely to be a recurring issue for the entire relationship and the longer you're together the harder it gets. Speaking from experience...", "Sometimes it's just a habit and doesn't necessarily replace sex. I'm somewhat addicted to masturbating, so I'll often do it 2-3 times a day even when having sex 3-4 times a week. \n\nBut the convenience factor is quite different between the two. Sex takes more energy because the connection with the partner is really important. More goes into it mentally and physically. But I can masturbate just about anytime someone isn't expecting me for 15-25 minutes. (Used to be quicker but I'm probably doing it too much)", "Is your relationship built on sex, or more than that?

Sex twice a week is plenty.", "YUP", "Being in the mood for a quick wank is not the same as being in the mood for sex with a partner. Masturbation can be a great stress reliever at the end of a busy day and takes almost zero foreplay and doesn\u2019t need to be in the mood for it. Having sex with a partner takes more than just the actions to be successful. You always need some sort of foreplay in order to not cause injuries from everything being too dry and too floppy, the act of sex takes a lot of energy as well, and if you\u2019re mentally not into it, it isn\u2019t going to be enjoyable for anyone.", "YTA. 5x a Week.  That's healthy amount.", "I\u2019ve been married for 12 years and my wife and I have a very healthy sex life. 4-5x a week generally. And I still beat my meat. Reasons: sometimes I just want to get it done and go about my day and it helps me last longer when we do have sex. Porn really isn\u2019t an issue unless it starts affecting your sex life. If he is subscribing to only fans or paying for cam subscriptions, that I can see it being an issue. Otherwise it\u2019s not an issue at all. Just let it go.", "watching that amount of porn damages your perception of sex, women and a lot of other stuff. nothing wrong about watching porn, but scientists are pretty clear about what is problematic and this is. masturbation also works without porn, people forgot that. Most men answering here never questioned their own porn consumption obviously. women often feel a sense of comparison if the partner jerks off to other people that often.\n\nhowever your response is disgusting, thats for sure. so regarding the amount of consumption is is definitely concerning (NTA) but your response if just nothing but hurtful and wont help the situation at all (YTA)", "YTA doctors literally say masturbating once a day is healthy. Now your boundaries with porn are up to you but if I\u2019m watching porn 5 times a week for like 5-15 minutes of my free time who cares? It\u2019s also not the same as sex. Sex includes worrying about a partner which makes it not all about you, but masturbating doesn\u2019t. \n\nIf you want more sex you need to communicate but twice a week is like, a pretty normal amount for people reaching 30", "YTA, you dont live together so whats the problem ? Gosh if it was a guy asking that, everybody will say \"toxic\".", "One or two times a day is absolutely normal", "YTA, sort of. It\u2019s not bad to have that conversation, but you fumbled it for sure. If you\u2019re both quite busy, then it\u2019s easy to see why you aren\u2019t fucking all the time. If you\u2019re schedule only allows for those times, that\u2019s all you\u2019ve got for the time being. Porn is so much easier than fucking, you should know that already. I\u2019ve been married a long time, but even when we were in the same phase as you guys, we weren\u2019t fucking every moment, because we were both busy a lot. And we lived together at that time. There\u2019s so much energy that goes into it. \n\nLook, I\u2019m like you, where I\u2019m more sexually energetic than my partner. It can be frustrating or make you feel some type of way, but everyone builds up that energy at a different pace. If that doesn\u2019t work for you, that needs desperately to be a conversation you have together. Communication is always key to healthy and happy relationships, and it should always be as neutral as possible; if you come across as accusatory or inconsiderate, you can lose honest communication from your partner.", "YTA but just talk to him about it. Seems like you two must be pretty good at communicating so it shouldn\u2019t be a problem. The other thing I will say is that from a male perspective, some guys choose to Jack off as a sort of calming, comforting ritual. It helps with sleep, it reduces stress, and it takes less energy. It\u2019s very possible for somebody to prefer masturbation to sex, because the two acts often fulfill different purposes. It\u2019s not just about being horny or not.", "YTA\n\nThere\u2019s a reason most people would say no to the question, \u201cWould you be cool with masturbating the rest of your life and never being with another person again?\u201d\u2014because masturbating and sex with another person is not the same thing.\n\nMaybe your bf does it to help him fall asleep, or stress relief, or because he\u2019s bored, or maybe he just wants a quick, low effort experience. Whatever the reason, he\u2019s not choosing masturbating over having sex with you. Those two actions aren\u2019t competing with each other.

Masturbating and having sex are not equivalent. Masturbating is like scratching an itch-getting a job done. For someone with a high libido that's gonna be something they need to scratch. It sounds like you two are having trouble blocking out the time to actually have sex. To a lot of people being intimate is a whole thing that requires energy and effort and time, and while it has a very huge payoff, it costs a lot of energy and schedules have to align. Masturbating scratches that itch but you don't have to put in a quarter of the effort and time-- even though objectively masturbating isn't better. I'd rather have actual intimacy! But when I'm keyed up and need to deal with it fast, nothing beats masturbation. Like this is coming from an afab nb person but sometimes I masturbate cause the libido is there but actually having sex is way more effort than rubbing one out real quick. And if I'm working a stressful job and not having time with my partner then I might find myself masturbating more often to compensate. (if it weren't for me and my partner living together and getting morning sex I would be a porn addict good Lord)\n\nIt sounds like you need to spend more time together, or have a conversation about some kind of signal you can give when you're together and want to *do the do.* Whether it's a trigger sentence or a necklace/bracelet or any other little thing like lighting a specific candle-- something that tells him *hey I'm in the mood and wanna smash!*  So he knows in unequivocal terms and you can get what you need sexually too!", "NTA.

That alone makes her YTA. Not only that, but if she wants sex more often than she's getting it, is she even instigating at all? She seems to equate sex with \"sleeping over,\" which is inherently limiting. Why not brush the placemats off the dining room table and do it when the sun is still up? It doesn't have to always be a soulful, heart-connecting production. Headed out for a nice dinner? Do as Dan Savage says: *fuck first.* Quickies are frickin *fantastic*.

Why not a lavish dinner?", "What does mastrubation have to do with having sex with others?", "He das the sex all the time, trust him", "She didn\u2019t judge him, she wondered why they aren\u2019t having more sex if his sex drive is clearly not an issue.
