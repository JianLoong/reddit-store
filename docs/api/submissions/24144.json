Masturbating is normal porn is normal.", "I\u2019m going with an unpopular opinion here, but I say you\u2019re NTA.  It really damages your self esteem when your partner wants to jerk it to porn all the time, but doesn\u2019t want sex with you very often. Every once in a while, just to get off quick and relieve stress, is one thing, but if you\u2019re jacking it to strangers three times as often as you have sex with the person you\u2019re supposed to actually be involved with, that\u2019s weird.  Real sex is just better; if you have a willing partner in a relatively newer relationship, but you choose to pass on it, that\u2019s a slap in the face, and he has to know that.", "YTA\n\nIf he made a big deal about how you masturbate, everyone would recognize how toxic and controlling it is. He's a grown up, he can decide for himself how often to masturbate.", "YTA\n\nHe does it when you\u2019re not around as you yourself point out. It\u2019d be a different story if he did that when you were there instead of being intimate with you.\n\nIt\u2019s his baloney to bop, you do not own him, especially when he is alone with his own body. I doubt you\u2019d see his anger as justified if the roles were reversed and he had a problem with you practicing your DJ skills and rocking the little man in the boat.", "Masturbating is different from sex. Requires less energy and also you get different satisfaction from each. While it\u2019s sometimes used as a replacement for sex, it can also be used as just a different experience from sex. \n\n\n\nIf you want to have sex more often then talk to him about it. It may be that while you\u2019re hanging out during the week neither of you initiates so it doesn\u2019t happen.

I held back. In situations where she isnt there, and won\u2019t be with me for many hours, I may watch porn and masturbate.

Daily is pretty normal, and it's completely different to having sex. Less energy used, no pressure, not worrying about another person's enjoyment, no concern with any insecurities in bed, and sometimes a person just wants alone time.", "I think you're understating the difference. Masturbating and being intimate with someone are wholly different, physically and emotionally. Even when you've been physically intimate for a long time, for some it's an enduring process and it can be quicker and easier to handle it yourself. I mean, you wouldn't ever want him to be intimate because he feels like he has to. I think as long as you communicate that it was a miscommunication that stemmed from you being taken aback it'll all be okay!", "Gentle YTA OP.\r  \nIt's important to approach situations like this with sensitivity and open communication, especially when discussing matters related to intimacy and personal preferences. While your question might have been rooted in your genuine curiosity and desire for more intimacy, it seems that it caught your boyfriend off guard and possibly made him feel defensive or inadequate.\r  \nIt might be a good idea to have a calm and empathetic conversation with your boyfriend to clear up any misunderstandings and address your concerns.\r  \nInstead of framing your concern as a criticism or blame, express your feelings and thoughts using \"I\" statements. For example, you could say, \"I was a bit surprised when I learned about the frequency of porn and masturbation. I want to understand better so we can both be on the same page.\"\r  \nIt's essential to keep the conversation non-confrontational and avoid making him feel guilty or inadequate. Remember that everyone has their individual preferences and habits.\r  \nDiscuss how you can work together to find a balance that meets both of your needs. This might involve understanding his perspective and finding ways to increase intimacy in your relationship that work for both of you.\r  \nRemember, relationships are built on understanding, empathy, and compromise. By approaching this topic with a caring and understanding attitude, you can create an environment where both of you feel comfortable discussing your feelings and needs.", "NTA", "As others said here, masturbation can be quick and that\u2019s what we need sometimes, just a quick poof so can get back to whatever we were doing", "NAH.

Now you can have a proper conversation about it.", "I don't think you'll get a fair measured response on Reddit. LOL. We all know it's full of masturbators and porn enthusiasts. People don't like it when you question their everyday normal.", "Idk why so many of the coments are justifying watching so much porn, but from experience of being with someone that did the same, at some point the sex started to happen less and less and he expected me to do some crazy stuff like in porn. And at some point he couldn't finish without wanking so I think you should really talk to him if you think that can help and explain your side. I you are NTA but need serious convo. Cuz yes it's is normal and almost everyone does it, but that much can be unheathy", "NTA. I would have had the same thought. What was his response?", " nta. that sounds like a possible porn addiction. i'd be upset if i found out my bf was watching porn at all, let alone that excessively.", "YTA, if you only see him a few times a week, how tf is he supposed to fuck you while you\u2019re not there \ud83d\ude11 also guys masturbate like allll the time.

Also before you judge him how often do you wank on your own?", "As everyone has already said, rubbing one out real quick can be done in a short amount of time without any prep work. If you honestly want more sex you should initiate for a quicky when you have a few minutes together. He\u2019d likely be down, but assumes you\u2019re not interested in just banging one out. But maybe you\u2019re not, and that\u2019s fine, but you have to let him do his thing without judgement. The amount he\u2019s doing it is totally normal.

It's just a sticky (no pun intended) situation to be in. I'd suggest having a no bullshit conversation about his level of interest in intimacy. If he's open to being more intimate, it might just be that he's not super comfortable initiating and you might just end up needing to be a bit more proactive.", "NTA cause I have no clue why he would volunteer that information. Bro sounds like he has a porn addiction", "NTA. i'd say he might have an addiction honestly, people with these addictions can find it hard to enjoy actual intimacy bcs their head is conditioned to only enjoy certain things. it's not your fault, but i suggest talking to him further about this and watching it everyday isn't healthy at all. it damages your brain functions", "omg nta if i found out my bf was watching porn daily id feel so\u2026 \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d", "YTA, I know many guys who say they look at porn and jerk off multiple times a DAY. The fact that he does it like 5 times a week seems like a low number compared to most guys I know lol\n\nBit of an overreaction, making a big deal out of nothing", "YTA, lightly. Men masturbate for lots of different reasons, not just as a substitute for sex with their partner. In fact, masturbation is actually sex, not a substitute for it. Everything that happens in the body when someone has sex with their partner also happens with masturbation. Like I said though, the more important point is that guys do it for different reasons, such as a release of tension from a bad day at work. Even boredom. It has very little, if anything, to do with how much or how little sex the two of you have.", "Nta\n\nHe has an addiction, don't take it personal and find somebody who doesn't get aroused by women exploited in  those conditions.", "NTA. Seems you need an honest discussion. He might think you prefer a good amount of foreplay and there wasn't time for that during the week.", "NTA", "NTA but he the wanker", "NTA Not that porn isn't fun sometimes but for his own benefit, he should try doing it without or way less often. He's almost 30 I mean he's not a teenager", "YTA. He's 27.", "Daily is normal maybe he's trying to control himself or is hiding some fetishes he's not comfortable with expressing", "For me it depends, YTA for reacting that way for him telling you something like that and not discussing it with him instead, but NTA if you ask to do it with him and he refused because he already watched porn. Though if you never ask I\u2019d say you\u2019re 100% the asshole because he may not want to ask you for sex everyday because you may take it in a bad way and think he\u2019s only with you for sex.", "NTA - porn addictions are very commun and can be very damaging, I'm not saying he has one for sure, but 5 times a week consistently isn't good. Very hard subject to raise though", "Could be porn Addiction.", "NTA\u2026 kinda. His porn consumption could be due to the lack of attention caused by yalls schedules, if so he\u2019s valid. If he doesn\u2019t have motivation to tend to your sexual needs bc of his self pleasure then you\u2019re valid. Let\u2019s him know how you\u2019re feeling about it in a calm and respectful manner and if he keeps on knowing that it bothers you and doesn\u2019t compromise to accommodate your needs, then he\u2019s TA, and you have a right to be more animated about the situation", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Communicating about sex is hard and masturbating is not adultery... as long as certain boundaries are not crossed. Having sex is way more complicated and requires communication, consent, foreplay, etc. So it can be a bit much to initiate sex every time, while masturbating is a quick and simple way to relieve stress. Also it prevents prostate cancer. \nIf you want to remove those barriers for him to have sex with you at any time either initiate or look in to CNC (consensual non consent), but do so at your own risk because it could damage your libido in the long run (because your needs aren't met) but that's up to you. Making a porn together could also be a possibility, but be aware of the risk of that leaking at a certain point.\n\nHowever... and this is my very personal, non research backed opinion, watching porn might not be sustainable depending on the type, amount and necessity of it. If he needs porn to masturbate and needs lots of it, this might be damaging to your relationship and the ability to have and enjoy sex. Especially if the porn he watches is increasingly different from the type of body you have and the kind of sex you are having, because he might be setting himself up for standards you cannot meet, leading to decreased interest in you. I myself, as a man, have always severely limited my porn intake and relied on my imagination for most of the time. I find this to be less alienating but like I said, that's personal and it's all about quantity and quality. If he watches \"girl next door\" porn for 10 minutes at a time that wouldn't bother me. If he has hour-long sessions to potentially illegal stuff - I would be very worried.", "The porn's not going to watch itself.", "YTA if you haven't actually expressed to him that you want to have more sex. He's the Ahole if you have any he's chosen to keep watching porn.", "Masturbating to porn takes like 10000000 times less effort than arranging to have sex, also actually doing the work in sex and making sure the other person orgasms too is just a hassle and getting the orgasm with porn is wayyyyyyy easier", "YTA. Not really any explanation needed. If your boyfriends wants to jerk off and doesn\u2019t want to have sex every night that\u2019s perfectly understandable and 1-2 times a week is still more then a lot of couples might have.", "We see each other almost every day, we only spend the night on weekends. There's definitely time, it's just not always convenient for him. But if it's convenient enough to wack it, why isn't it convenient for sex?", "I\u2019m a female and masturbate a lot of days, it\u2019s so normal and as you said so is porn. It\u2019s a great stress reliever tbh.", "Similar to what I was thinking with an exception.\nI don't know that he knew that or thought too much about it. From OP's description, it sounds like he knows now.\n\nOP, I hope you both talk it through, work out both of your needs, and it all works out.", "Just letting you know I\u2019m stealing \u201cbop my baloney\u201d", "Did you read a completely different post than the rest of us? No one said anything about addiction and no one said anything about him being too exhausted from wanking to have actual sex with his girlfriend.  He watches porn on the days his girlfriend ISNT there. She\u2019s only staying over on the weekends and they\u2019re having sex two out of the three days she\u2019s there most weeks.", "So, you\u2019d be absolutely okay if your partner greatly preferred masturbating to strangers than having relations with you?  You\u2019d be the only person I\u2019ve known who would be, then.", "Bad News for you....", "eh", "To be fair, cranking one out doesn\u2019t take that long. No foreplay required, no mood setting etc. if you\u2019d rock up a his place \u201cready for action\u201d, I\u2019m sure he\u2019d chose you over a quick whack.  \nBut since we both know getting it on takes longer than snapping your fingers, it is understandable he quickly jacks it and goes on with his day.", "Well jerking off is way less work, physically and emotionally, takes way less time, and is purely a selfish act vs sex. So it could definitely be that it\u2019s convenient to wack it but not convenient for sex.", "Wacking it is a lot faster and sometimes that all we want. Just to release it. Sex requires foreplay and intimacy which maybe he only has enough to give twice a week", "I think YTA based on this. It seems like he wants to spend his time with you doing other things aside from sex. Masturbating alone can be simple, quick, and dirty for some people. With the goal just to have a nice orgasm and go on their way.\n\nBut then between the both of you: there are 100 ways a couple can be close, feel love for each other, and have intimate moments that aren\u2019t sex. He may prefer to watch a movie with you and talk about the plot, he may like your laugh when you\u2019re cooking together, he may like the way your brow furrows when you\u2019re focusing on the crossword.\n\nHim masturbating daily instead of having sex with you daily is NOT an insult. Try not to take it as such", "As others have said sex and masturbation are not the same thing. Also I'd add that although the professional porn industry has some scummy practices, that doesn't make porn in itself an evil thing. There's absolutely porn out there that doesn't exploit the models.\n\nThe bigger potential issue is with your sexual compatibility. I'd suggest a frank conversation about whether your libidos are compatible, it's more than likely to be a recurring issue for the entire relationship and the longer you're together the harder it gets. Speaking from experience...", "Sometimes it's just a habit and doesn't necessarily replace sex. I'm somewhat addicted to masturbating, so I'll often do it 2-3 times a day even when having sex 3-4 times a week. \n\nBut the convenience factor is quite different between the two. Sex takes more energy because the connection with the partner is really important. More goes into it mentally and physically. But I can masturbate just about anytime someone isn't expecting me for 15-25 minutes. (Used to be quicker but I'm probably doing it too much)", "Is your relationship built on sex, or more than that? Because it may just be he wants to spend couple time together, not just coupling time. Just because there\u2019s time doesn\u2019t mean you have to be 10 toes to Jesus.", "Sorta tough. Don't really get to decide when you're in the mood, and it seems like he's in the mood more often when you're not around. ESH, you guys need to work on this together", "I didn\u2019t suggested anything of the sort. \n\nCriticizing your SO about anything they share with you is going to make them reluctant to continue being honest. \n\nThat\u2019s why if it\u2019s something you don\u2019t agree with it\u2019s better to remove yourself from the situation until you\u2019re able to articulate your opinion without judging them.", "How do you know he \u201cgreatly prefers\u201d that?", "Yeah, that would give me time to do MY masturbating.  Sex twice a week is plenty.", "YUP", "Being in the mood for a quick wank is not the same as being in the mood for sex with a partner. Masturbation can be a great stress reliever at the end of a busy day and takes almost zero foreplay and doesn\u2019t need to be in the mood for it. Having sex with a partner takes more than just the actions to be successful. You always need some sort of foreplay in order to not cause injuries from everything being too dry and too floppy, the act of sex takes a lot of energy as well, and if you\u2019re mentally not into it, it isn\u2019t going to be enjoyable for anyone."]}
