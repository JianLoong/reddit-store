Not your business.", "NTA\n\nYou and your GF need to have a long conversation about the 24 year old's failure to launch.  Whose home is this?", "How do you feel about growing old with her and her son?  Together. In the same house. It seems that this is what she has accepted and doesn\u2019t care to change. You need to decide if that\u2019s a deal breaker for you. Even if he pays rent for I expect it won\u2019t change his habits or ambition. \n\nNTA", "NTA.  Your gf sounds like my dad's wife.  Her 30yo son refuses to hold down a job and she won't kick him out of my dad's basement.  Her son is so useless his siblings have told stepmom that if something happens to her stepbro is on his own, they will not take him in.", "NTA, he is a grown man, who is i can only assume eating your groceries, using your utilities, $300 a month seems a reasonable price as would be way more expensive if he lived on his own, and might prompt him to do something about his situation", "What is the living arrangement? Did they move in with you/vice versa? What's your long-term plan for this relationship?\n\n\nIf they moved in with you, then you have the right to expect a grown man to pay rent to live in your space. If he is living in her house, and she's happy with the arrangement, then it's not your business. \n\n\nShe is failing at parenting by not leading him to becoming an independent adult, but that's another conversation.\n\n\nNTA.", "NTA but is this you sharing your opinion on what he should do in his Mom's house or are they both living with you in your place/somewhere you share with your gf? If he's living in his Mom's place just the two of them you can suggest it but not enforce it. If it's also your place then you can enforce him paying rent (though it will likely affect your relationship with your gf)", "NTA - good luck finding a new girlfriend.", "NTA. $300 bucks is insanely reasonable. Moms like these don't do their kids any favors by coddling them. Especially when they make it too comfortable. Why would he be incentivized to leave and be independent when he gets to stay rent-free at home with no real responsibilities? Especially if he just not naturally inclined to want to leave the nest.", "My sister told her son he either had to be in school (which she would help fund), or paying rent. Rent started when he was eighteen, and increased over time, with him expected to pay something like market rent when he was 21. He moved out right before his twenty-first birthday, and while I wouldn't say he's launching well, I think the arrangement helped.", "NTA, but if it\u2019s money you don\u2019t need and your intention is to encourage him to be independent\u2026 ask your girlfriend how she\u2019d feel about collecting the rent and putting at least part of it in savings that you could turn back to him if he gets his shit together and flies the nest. Don\u2019t tell him about the plan though. Just her. \n\nThis is assuming he already pays for his own things like groceries, and he does his own share of chores around the house.", " NTA\n\nHowever taking 300 from him a month will make it harder for him to LEAVE (which is what it sounds like you want). \n\nMaybe make him pay rent for a year then give it back to him as a sec deposit on his own apt? The goal should be to get him out, not make money off him and keep him there.\n\nEdit: has anyone ever told the kid they expect him to be an adult and move out? I\u2019m thinking no given his mothers instance on making life easy for him. Maybe just needs a man to man conversation. Something tells me he\u2019s never had one in his life at all.", "NTA it's your house, you have a choice who lives in it and if they paying", "Depends, did she and her son move in with you, or did you move in with her and her son?  If it's your home, you can impose some rules. If you moved into the situation, you can advise, but it's not your place to try and dictate.\n\nHowever, if he's 24 and has failed to launch, for his own good, she needs to start insisting that he begin to transition into adulthood. Paying his share of the average monthly utilities is a good start, and perfectly reasonable, He needs to have a 5-year plan for his life and start working toward those goals. However, you have to understand that while you can advise and gently push your gf, you are not the parent - unless you've been in a parenting role with her son for more than a decade. Then you might rate a voice, if not a vote.  NTA for being concerned about his future prospects.", "Do you live with your gf?", "NTA but I am curious do you plan to deliver this news or will your girlfriend?  \n\nAlso if he was pursuing a career would you still want rent?", "NTA. It's perfectly reasonable to expect a grown man to pay $300 a month in rent. \n\nYou're absolutely right about his plan to chill with his mom forever. He has a comfortable life with no responsibilities and obligations, and given his apparent lack of drive to do anything meaningful with his life, there's almost certainly no chance that he's going to change on his own. Mom pays all the bills, grandma chauffeurs him around, and he gets to sit on ass and play video games all night and sleep all day, so there's no incentive for him to strive for anything more.\n\nIf you want advice, I'll say this: he needs to be somewhat uncomfortable in his living situation to motivate him to do better for himself. He should be paying rent, buying all his own food, cooking and cleaning up after himself, and paying his grandmother to drive him around. Once he realizes that he has to deal with all the downsides of being an adult, like bills and responsibility, but gets none of the upsides, like independence and freedom, he just might sort his life out and actually become an adult. \n\nMy in laws did the same thing with my sister in law, letting her live at home without paying for anything because they don't want her to have to do anything difficult, and she just turned 30. Still lives at home, has a part time job bagging groceries, no education or marketable skills, contributes nothing to household expenses, has no car, and treats my mother and father in law like shit in their own home. She has zero desire to change, because her parents still allow her to act like she's 15. I'm definitely not a \"spare the rod, spoil the child,\" kind of person, but some young people need a kick in the ass to get them to transition into the world and become a real person, and if no one ever gives it to them, they end up being a turd of a human being. At 24 years old, he is a grown man. It's time for him to start acting like it, and paying $300 in rent is the least he can do.", "NTA-But why are you with this kids mom because obviously he will be free loading until mom dies?", "ETA: judgement after response.\n\nIn general, NTA, but you should try to get your gf on your side before you try to enforce this.\n\n\nInfo: whose house is it? Do you both equally own it and equally contribute to the bills? Did you move in to her home that she owns and pays for? Did she and son move in to your home that you own? Etc.", "NAH.\n\nI can understand your frustration if you feel like you're subsidising this lifestyle, however some of the things you have described about this person are hallmarks of depression. \n\n\\- Sleeps all day\n\n\\- Escapism through video games\n\n\\- Lack of motivation\n\nYou should discuss this with your GF but I would perhaps explore the idea that he's not mentally well and maybe helping on that angle will work more in your favour than just demanding rent.", "INFO Why do you think what he does is not a career? And why do you expect him to use UBER or LYFT when there seems to be an alternative? I mean yes, it is convenient, but also actively burning money.", "NTA I don\u2019t know what kind of money he\u2019s making or what job he\u2019s doing but at 24, 300 a month should be doable. If he can\u2019t afford it then he should pursue a career or a trade or even just try to find a job that pays better. He should definitely try to learn how to drive. It\u2019s not easy but it\u2019s an investment that every adult should make in themselves just for their own independence. It\u2019s sounds a bit like he\u2019s in a rut and perhaps a bit of tough love is what he needs to come out of it a better man.", "NTA for wanting him to pay rent. He\u2019s an adult living in your home and it\u2019s not unreasonable to expect him to contribute.\n\nYTA for your attitude about him though. Not everyone has to have a \u201ccareer\u201d, people who work \u201cjobs\u201d contribute just as much to society. Do you think your food will walk itself to your table when you dine out? Will the groceries at the grocery store stock themselves? And who cares if he spends his time off playing video games? You don\u2019t get to decide which hobbies are worthwhile. \n\nIf you don\u2019t want him living off of you anymore, I get that, and there\u2019s things you can do to make his home life just uncomfortable enough to encourage him to seek more independence (refusing to buy his groceries, making him pay rent, contribute to utilities and the internet bill, etc). But you don\u2019t have the right to be passing judgement on his job or his hobbies just because they aren\u2019t things that you value.", "NTA.  I agree with you that he is happily sponging off his mother and will live with you forever if he doesn't learn responsibility.   Maybe compromise on the dollar amount,  but this kid has to get off his ass and realize grandma and ma won't be around forever to baby him.", "NTA.

I'll probably end up paying more if my parents end up buying the house they're looking at. \n\nTo explain his behavior, either he's depressed or he found the path of least resistance and has no desire to grow. For me, it's both. But, he does need to start contributing if he is going to be a permanent fixture in the household. I pay rent and have a list of chores that are mine to do around the house. I also ask to borrow the car instead of asking my grandmother to drive me, and I bought a moped with the money I got from my insurance (my car was wrecked and I didn't want to use it as a down payment for another car) so I would have a way around if the car wasn't available. \n\nI highly recommend not only asking for $300 but demanding that he get his drivers license, do some chores, and get mental help if he needs it.
