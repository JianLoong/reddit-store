If it's also your place then you can enforce him paying rent (though it will likely affect your relationship with your gf)", "NTA - good luck finding a new girlfriend.", "NTA. $300 bucks is insanely reasonable. Moms like these don't do their kids any favors by coddling them. Especially when they make it too comfortable. Why would he be incentivized to leave and be independent when he gets to stay rent-free at home with no real responsibilities? Especially if he just not naturally inclined to want to leave the nest.", "My sister told her son he either had to be in school (which she would help fund), or paying rent. Rent started when he was eighteen, and increased over time, with him expected to pay something like market rent when he was 21. He moved out right before his twenty-first birthday, and while I wouldn't say he's launching well, I think the arrangement helped.", "NTA, but if it\u2019s money you don\u2019t need and your intention is to encourage him to be independent\u2026 ask your girlfriend how she\u2019d feel about collecting the rent and putting at least part of it in savings that you could turn back to him if he gets his shit together and flies the nest. Don\u2019t tell him about the plan though. Just her. \n\nThis is assuming he already pays for his own things like groceries, and he does his own share of chores around the house.", " NTA\n\nHowever taking 300 from him a month will make it harder for him to LEAVE (which is what it sounds like you want). \n\nMaybe make him pay rent for a year then give it back to him as a sec deposit on his own apt? The goal should be to get him out, not make money off him and keep him there.\n\nEdit: has anyone ever told the kid they expect him to be an adult and move out? I\u2019m thinking no given his mothers instance on making life easy for him. Maybe just needs a man to man conversation. Something tells me he\u2019s never had one in his life at all.", "NTA it's your house, you have a choice who lives in it and if they paying", "Depends, did she and her son move in with you, or did you move in with her and her son?  If it's your home, you can impose some rules. If you moved into the situation, you can advise, but it's not your place to try and dictate.\n\nHowever, if he's 24 and has failed to launch, for his own good, she needs to start insisting that he begin to transition into adulthood. Paying his share of the average monthly utilities is a good start, and perfectly reasonable, He needs to have a 5-year plan for his life and start working toward those goals. However, you have to understand that while you can advise and gently push your gf, you are not the parent - unless you've been in a parenting role with her son for more than a decade. Then you might rate a voice, if not a vote.  NTA for being concerned about his future prospects.", "Do you live with your gf?", "NTA but I am curious do you plan to deliver this news or will your girlfriend?  \n\nAlso if he was pursuing a career would you still want rent?", "NTA. It's perfectly reasonable to expect a grown man to pay $300 a month in rent. \n\nYou're absolutely right about his plan to chill with his mom forever. He has a comfortable life with no responsibilities and obligations, and given his apparent lack of drive to do anything meaningful with his life, there's almost certainly no chance that he's going to change on his own. Mom pays all the bills, grandma chauffeurs him around, and he gets to sit on ass and play video games all night and sleep all day, so there's no incentive for him to strive for anything more.\n\nIf you want advice, I'll say this: he needs to be somewhat uncomfortable in his living situation to motivate him to do better for himself. He should be paying rent, buying all his own food, cooking and cleaning up after himself, and paying his grandmother to drive him around. Once he realizes that he has to deal with all the downsides of being an adult, like bills and responsibility, but gets none of the upsides, like independence and freedom, he just might sort his life out and actually become an adult. \n\nMy in laws did the same thing with my sister in law, letting her live at home without paying for anything because they don't want her to have to do anything difficult, and she just turned 30. Still lives at home, has a part time job bagging groceries, no education or marketable skills, contributes nothing to household expenses, has no car, and treats my mother and father in law like shit in their own home. She has zero desire to change, because her parents still allow her to act like she's 15. I'm definitely not a \"spare the rod, spoil the child,\" kind of person, but some young people need a kick in the ass to get them to transition into the world and become a real person, and if no one ever gives it to them, they end up being a turd of a human being. At 24 years old, he is a grown man. It's time for him to start acting like it, and paying $300 in rent is the least he can do.", "NTA-But why are you with this kids mom because obviously he will be free loading until mom dies?", "ETA: judgement after response.\n\nIn general, NTA, but you should try to get your gf on your side before you try to enforce this.\n\n\nInfo: whose house is it?

If he can\u2019t afford it then he should pursue a career or a trade or even just try to find a job that pays better. He should definitely try to learn how to drive. It\u2019s not easy but it\u2019s an investment that every adult should make in themselves just for their own independence. It\u2019s sounds a bit like he\u2019s in a rut and perhaps a bit of tough love is what he needs to come out of it a better man.", "NTA for wanting him to pay rent.

Not everyone has to have a \u201ccareer\u201d, people who work \u201cjobs\u201d contribute just as much to society. Do you think your food will walk itself to your table when you dine out? Will the groceries at the grocery store stock themselves? And who cares if he spends his time off playing video games? You don\u2019t get to decide which hobbies are worthwhile. \n\nIf you don\u2019t want him living off of you anymore, I get that, and there\u2019s things you can do to make his home life just uncomfortable enough to encourage him to seek more independence (refusing to buy his groceries, making him pay rent, contribute to utilities and the internet bill, etc).

No, but what\u2019s the harm in checking?", "Make him pay and have some responsibility", "Probably should kick him out, would be doing him a favor in the long run.", "NTA\nBut since he won't save up for a car, take that $300 and put it up each month, for about 4-5 months and use it to buy him a car on fb market place. Something cheap. \n\n\nHell, make it $450 and it would take less time than that.", "This is simple.  He's 24 kick him out.  If his mom disagrees drop her ass also.", " Honestly the $300 is to little for someone who\u2019s never leaving", "**Do not let him move in with you.** You will regret it. He will be mooching off off you beyond his 40\u2019s. He\u2019s an adult and needs to learn to support himself. \n\nThis is a hill to die on, even if it costs you your relationship.", "NTA, that's a pittance to charge an adult with a full time job. Your girlfriend and her son should be appreciative instead of trying to make you partially or wholly responsible for supporting a fully grown man!", "Yta, not your kid, not your business", "I mean I lived with my parents until 30. Was only paying 150 a week and lived the life pretty much being described here apart from the lack of driver license. \n\nI saved enough to be able to put a deposit down on a house so win for me I think.", "I pay my mother $400/mo to live in her house (mind you, I did move out and have moved back in.)", "NTA. I moved out and got my ass in gear because my parents told me that after high school if I was still living in the house I would have to contribute. The reason he has no motivation is because he is living free and has no reason to be motivated.", "If that\u2019s the case op should collect rent and put it in a savings account and match the kids savings on exit!", "I don\u2019t understand why these type of comments are getting down voted\u2026 seems like OP left out a bunch of details just looking for everyone to agree with him. Like if he said gf and son could move in within the past year and all of a sudden now wants to kick the son out, that\u2019s an AH move because yes should\u2019ve had some foresight to discuss before they moved in. Sure it\u2019s *probably true gf is enabling son but impossible to know without more context. IS the son saving his earnings for a car or place?? Sounds like OP hasn\u2019t really gotten to know him at all. If he\u2019s wanting to stay with GF, then demanding the son pay X amount of rent isn\u2019t going to help any of the relationships involved. Is the amount unreasonable? Probably not but again, more context is needed.", "I know i do!  It\u2019s so hard! I wanna stay in bed and read Reddit but then stuff doesn\u2019t get done.  So not fair.  <sigh\u20ac", "NTA\n\nI mean maybe you could adjust the amount but ultimately if she doesn\u2019t want him to struggle he needs a job"]}
